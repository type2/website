Subject: A&amp;E Systems Catalina 2500 awning report
Date: Sat, 8 Jun 1996 09:04:25 -0700

The awning I ordered for my '87 Wesfalia arrived and I got it installed 
yesterday. I'm really pleased, it's a high-quality product and was quite 
easy to install without drilling any holes in the van. I got the A&amp;E 
Systems Catalina 2500 in the 9' 10&quot; size. With the van adapter kit for 
rain-gutter installation, total cost came to about $400. I purchased the 
awning through Camping World via mail order. Their number is 800.626.5944.

The 9' 10&quot; size is the largest size you can install on the Westfalia 
without it protruding from either end of the van. Installed, it's about 4&quot; 
shorter than the pop top at each end and extends 8' from the van when 
opened. Everything folds up into the streamlined aluminum case. The 
mounting kit consists of 3 2-piece extruded aluminum brackets that clamp 
onto the rain gutter. I installed one on either side of the sliding door 
and one just behind the rear side window. The brackets look like they were 
designed especially for Vanagons, and indeed the instructions show a 
Westfalia in the installation diagrams. These brackets could be used to 
install other awnings as well as the A&amp;E models. What I really like about 
this setup is that I didn't have to modify my van in any way and I can 
remove the awning in about 15 minutes if I want to. Since I do quite a bit 
of off season camping, I'll probably leave it on year round.

I didn't install the bottom mounting brackets that allow the arm assemblies 
to mount to the van and extend at an angle to support the awning. This 
setup doesn't really work well on the Vanagon because there is no good 
place to put these brackets. Instead, I just set up the awning with the arm 
assemblies running straight down to the ground. This works just as well and 
the awning is still free standing. Hopefully, I'll have some pictures 
soon...
