Subject: upholstery question

Hey all,
Since my posts from my WOW account seem to not be making it to the list, I will
post this query from my mom's compuserve account.  Here's the deal:  I need to
replace the seat cushions in the front seats in my '78 bus.  Not the backrests,
just the butt cushions.  On my seat, i can feel the springs through the vinyl.
there is no cushion at all intervening.  no wonder it's been uncomfortable on
long trips! :)  Anyway, while I'm at it, i need to replace the driver's side
seat cover, not backrest cover, just seat cover.  mine isripped and torn and is
getting worse every day.  Problem:  all the stores only carry the upholstery as
a set, for both front seats, costing around $100.  Well, dammit, I don't want
the whole freakin' set, I just want one damn driver's side seat cover.  Why must
they sell it as a whole set?????  vent mode off.  So, I now appeal to the list
to help me out with this.  does anyone have a driver's side seat cover for a '78
bus in BROWN that has no rips, no tears, and no holes???  If so I want it, let
me know how much you want.  Also, when I'm doing this procedure, how difficult
is it??  How do those damn hog-ring things work?  I guess I need to buy the
little kit that RMMW sells with hog ring pliers and hog rings?  I know I've got
to take the seat out, but I assume the procedure isn't too high on the
difficulty scale.  anyone?

Thanks,
Sean
