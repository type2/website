Subject: Hoo Boy! (Was: Corrado Powered Westy Syncro - For Sale)

Now that may be the solution to the power question! (Doing it oneself, 
not paying $30K!)

Can anyone local call the seller up and ask for technical details? Like, 
how does the engine fit?

I've already posted the ad on the SW page...
