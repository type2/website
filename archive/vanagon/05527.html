Steve Johnson laments:
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, and then you should sell your unused MXL's to a hungry starving 2WD 
&gt; Vanagon driver so he doesn't have to look all over Hell and half of Georgia
&gt; to get another set.  ;)
&gt; 

Just call Tire Rack.  I bought three about 6 weeks ago.  They were $74
each, plus $9 shipping the set.  They sent them via ups and arrived in the 
morning two days after I ordered (I ordered as they were closing, so
they arrived the day after they shipped).

Saved 8.5% on sales tax.  Went to my nearby economically disadvantaged 
area, and picked a used tire shop, and had them mounted and balanced for
$8.50 a tire.  Sears wanted $81.69 each, plus $10 (or $12) to mount and
balance, and I would have had to pay the Governor 8.5% on top.  Sears
was the cheapest local I could find letting my fingers do the walking.

I would suggest going mail order.  Oh, I bought the 205/75 reinforced
MXLs.  I think the 185s are cheaper.
