 Anyone,
 
 Reading my owners manual and my filler cap (and posts on the list) I see
that
 I am supposed to use only phosphate free ethyl glycol based antifreeze.  Is
 the VW dealer the only place to get this or is all ethyl gylcol based
 anti-freeze phosphate free????  I have been reading labels and nobody lists
 &quot;phosphate&quot; as an ingredient.  The teenage Goober behind the counter hasn't
 been much help.
  &gt;&gt;
All of the &quot;Long Lofe&quot; antifreezes are phosphate and silicone free.
 Prestone, Zerex, Texaco, and others are now marketing these products as the
newer cars are calling for them.
