Subject: Vanagon digest 1170

Hi everyone,

What's the procedure for getting a second copy of Vanagon digest 1170?  My
computer froze up or something like that while downloading it, and somehow
it disappeared from both my home computer and my Unix account.  Would
someone mind forwarding me a copy?  I can't go on without my daily Vanagon
fix....

Thanks,

Mark Daley
