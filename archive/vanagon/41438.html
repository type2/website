Subject:  re: deep cycle battery

ron wrote:&gt;I recently came across a battery in a stereo magazine that
might do the trick.  I have not bought one yet, though, so I cannot give
any sort of review.  Here are the details:

Stinger dry cell Power Master  (Model SPB-1000)
     True Deep-cycle battery
     Withstands more than 400 cycles of 100% discharge

     32.4 lbs.
     5 year service life

               Draw:       Capacity:
              ------       ----------------------------
