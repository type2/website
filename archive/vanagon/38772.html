Subject: Speaking of Practical Jokes. . .

NPR did a good April Fool's Day story about Starbucks building a 
&quot;coffee bean slurry pipeline&quot; from Seattle to New York with the 
technical assistance of the Alaskan pipeline builders.  It ran for 
about 15 minutes and was hilarious.  I set about having some fun by 
calling friends and family and telling them about it.  When they 
professed disbelief, I told them to just listen since we all know 
that NPR is a respectable organization. He, he, he.

PS:  I think I'll let them off the hook friday if they don't figure 
out the joke.
