Subject: Syncro &quot;binds&quot; in tight turns

Hello all! I am new to the list and new to syncros, so I have lots of
questions. 

1) In tight turns such as parking, reversing out of driveways, U-turns etc.,
there is great resistance to motion. It feels as if the brakes  are binding,
but they aren't. Give it gas and it moves right around, but let off the gas
and it rapidly decellerates.
Is this normal syncro behaviour or is there a problem. 

2) Under heavy braking there is a severe knocking under my feet. The mechanic
who checked out the car for me at purchase time told me that while the car
has had recent brake work the rotors still need to be turned. The car has
also had new front CVJ's in the last 30k miles.
Is this likely to be a brake problem, a CVJ problem or something else more
sinister and costly?

Thanks your advice.... Joe
