&gt;-After driving about 15 minutes at moderate speed, I ran up the 
&gt;highway at about 3500rpm in 3rd, before braking for a hard right turn 
&gt;to the dealer, and up a short hill (in 1st), after which the oil 
&gt;pressure light/buzzer came on- it stayed on for 5-10 secs before I 
&gt;killed the engine &amp; coasted. Temp was middle gauge, fan not on. I 
&gt;started it again &amp; seemed fine, oil level ok.
&gt;I suspect that the run at 3500 pumped the oil to the heads, and the 
&gt;quick stop &amp; turn starved the oil pickup for a moment, but I can't 
&gt;believe it was this easy to do...
&gt;My Jetta's got 330K &amp; only had this happen once, while climbing a 
&gt;mountain pass flat-out (turbo diesel)...
&gt;Is this a common thing, or should I be looking for signs of trouble 
&gt;here?

This has only happened once on my '87.....I just replaced the engine!

&gt;Is the '87 a 1.9 or 2.1 l. ? Is there a code difference? 

Engine code should be MV, a 2.1 liter.

&gt;The engine 
&gt;looks *very* clean (NO oil underneath) almost like it's been steam 
&gt;cleaned. 

I'd be certain that it has been steam cleaned.  Dealers like to do that.
