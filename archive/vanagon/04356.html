Ken,

Up to 67 big curved 12&quot; badge - cool. (won't fit a bay window)
68 -  72 9&quot; badge.
73 -  79 Crummy 7&quot; plastic badge.


I found a 9&quot; badge for my bus at a Classic Car show earlier
in the year. I paid 15 UK pounds for it. I figured that when
I put it on my bus it might get stolen (those Beasty Boys!)
so i run an M4 die down the bottom two mounting dowels and
put two M4 nuts on the dowels when the badge was fitted. You
can get to the bottom two dowels by removing the cardboard
kick panels under the dash - it's not been stolen yet!

I know a guy who sells repro badges for the 68-71, I've seen
steel ones and polished cast aluminium ones hung on his wall.
I know its in England but drop him a letter and see what price
he comes up with - the mail cost can't be that expensive.
