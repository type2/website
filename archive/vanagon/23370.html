Eugene,
	I got almost the same emission stats on my '74 super Beetle.  The 
test tech said that his shop would probably be investigated by the state 
of California because of these low results.  This was on a 100% 
complete,people show, 1974 engine.  I retarded the ignition timing 2 
degrees to insure compliance.  I guess my take on this is that the our 
unelected &quot;clean air&quot; people are more interested in their careers than 
clean air(why should a shop fear State reprisals for passing a clean 
car?).  Also, it is regressive and unfair to deny the most of us access 
to our cars simply because they are old, but clean(sort of!).  Gary Gibson
