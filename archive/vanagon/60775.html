Subject: '86 Syncro Westy or '91 Westy F.S. in NJ

I still have a 86 Syncro Westy and 91 Westy available. The 86 has 136k and
is in very nice shape. I'd like to get about $10k or best offer. The 91 is a
G.L. with everything and 72 K on it. It is near perfect inside and out, and
I'm asking $16,500 firm.  The vans are located in NW NJ near the PA and NY
state borders. I'm a private owner and I need to sell one or the other, my
wife is loosing her sense of humor. Thank you,  Kris Weber
