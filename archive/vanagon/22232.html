Subject: PTFE as Transmission Elixur?

Tim Smith recently warned against using anything with PTFE for engines.
Does the same concern hold true for transmissions? I recently bought some
transmission cure-all in desperation (Shifting is quite stiff and I'm
reaching for a cure), but I haven't put it in the tranny (even though I
changed fluid this weekend). I don't like the tight shifting, but I can
live with that for the next six months as I save up the $$$ for a rebuilt
or new (yeah, dream-on, bubba) tranny.

The retailer told me today that I could bring it back in the next day or
two if I decided I didn't want to risk it. Should I put that $10 bill back
into my own pocket? or should I go for it.

Thanks! Joe Fournier

                        kept the drum from going on easily...btw, looking for
                        a cure for that too...8-)
