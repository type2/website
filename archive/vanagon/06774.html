&gt; Your refer to that rectangular light in the engine lid as a third brake light.
&gt; When I was just a kid, we had a '56 microbus. It had the center light that 
&gt; you refer to - It was the ONLY brake light. The outboard lights which
&gt; were quite small, maybe 1 1/2 inches in diameter, were turn signals only. It 
&gt; had those cool looking &quot;bullet&quot; turn signals in the front. I think that other
&gt; buses I saw back then that didn't have the central brake light, had outboard
&gt; circular, flat lenses about 2 inches in diameter (the ones on our '56 were
&gt; kind of bulbous).

You are correct, that is the only brake light.  I have the bubble lenses
on mine, also.  But you see, to &quot;normal&quot; people trying to explain how this
setup works, its simpler to describe it as the 3rd brake light, even though
its really 1 of 1.  And everyone I'd talked to in my search for this
thing knew exactly what I was talking about.

However, I have seen a few later buses (still splits though) that have 
put one on the engine lids on.  I those cases, it truly is a 3rd brakelight.
