Subject: Re: bus boys non 800 number


&gt;Our local number is 916-244-1616.  But beware - it's just as jammed up as 
the
&gt;800 line.  Mondays and Thurdays are the worst days to call in.  The moment
&gt;Bill or I hang up one line it rings within seconds.&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Recommendation -  FAX (916-244-0933) your inquiries, orders, etc..  When 
Bill
&gt;and I are on the phone we are usually at the same time workin' on someone's
&gt;FAX request.  Now if either one of us starts to chew bubble gum at the same
&gt;time.....well the whole situation crashes :-).
&gt;
&gt;I answer the E-Mail at home from 6AM to about 10AM Pacific.  Then I go in 
to
&gt;give Bill a hand (he's been there since about 7:30AM).  We each take about 
15
&gt;minutes to grab a bite at the local choke and puke.  Bill's outa there at
&gt;about 6:30PM, but I'm usually there until as late as 10:30PM (tonight I got
&gt;out of there at about 8:30PM).  I usually spend the rest of the evening
&gt;answering E-Mail that came in during the day as well as doing the rest of 
the
&gt;paperwork (Payroll's tonite).  Figure I'll be in the sack by 1:30AM. BTW, 
it
&gt;was 105 today in Redding and we have no AC, just fans.


If there was ever a business screaming to expand, yours has gotta be it.
Have any plans to get more phone lines and hire a few more answerers? Sounds
to me (in my mostly-ignorant opinion) like your phone system is a horrendous
bottleneck, preventing all those nice juicy orders from flooding in, among
all the call for information, wrong numbers, etc.

Judging from my own recent experience, I'd say that old VW buses are *not*
in a situation where they need FEWER parts as time goes on...  :^)
