Subject: Lube in the coolant?

Just got my new Mother Earth News, and it has an article by a mechanic who
suggests adding &quot;water pump lube&quot; to the antifreeze--says it will increase the
life of the water pump.  As I'm on water pump #3 in my 85, this sounds good! 
Anyone have any comments/opinions on this?

David
