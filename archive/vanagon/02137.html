&gt;PS Is there any place that sells EGRs cheap? Thanks in advance - DC 

Looking for those hard to find smog parts in Calif?  The current smog
law states that money is no object when it comes to putting your auto
into compliance.  If you can locate the part, you must buy it and in-
stall it.  If it's not available anymore, you may get a smog waiver.

Here's a list of hard-to-find smog parts retailers in Calif. that I
got by calling the California Dept. of Consumer Affairs and the
Bureau of Automotive Repair.

HELP             (800) 544-4357
Economy          (800) 327-1449
Clean Air        (800) 409-1144
Specialized Auto (800) 398-4985
Unique Imports   (714) 951-5201

DISCLAIMER: I have nothing to do with these companies other than being
a customer that needed to replace some old, worn out smog parts.
