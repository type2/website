My bud has a serious case of the saggies.  Stop...don't kill me....i know
everyone ranted about this last week...only thing is i couldn't make heads
or tails of it....i checked out the archive but it didn't help
much...alister says he solved the problem by changing his
shocks...what?...i think my bus  was once seriously lowered [or else
someone was _way_ fat!] and i'd like it to be normal height.

please don't flame me...i want to solve this problem.  busses look silly
three inches off the ground.
