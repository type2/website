Subject: live chat night

Hi Volks,
   I've mentioned recently about having a live chat night on an Irc system.
Well, I was told about channel VW on 'The Efnet'.  Well I've stopped by a
few times and that there was no one there to chat with. Sure there was a
couple of people on the channel, but they were not talking.   Anyway, I'm
going to set a date to have a live chat nite.  Next Friday February 17th
starting at 6pm est lets all get together on channel Volkswagen, on IRC
server 'US undernet. org' I'll set it up and anyone who can access it can
join.  I think this will be fun. We can talk on the channel as long as
anyone likes. If it works out we can set future dates so that we can all
get together and yak VW's.  BTW, when I can I open channel Volkswagen on
'The undernet' so if your on IRC stop in and see if its on.  Talk to you
later.  Take care.  See you on 'The undernet'
