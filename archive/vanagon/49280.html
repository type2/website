Subject: Re: CCC's 9/20 trip particulars


I have seen kids mentioned...and now time for dogs...

I will be bringing Argo and Lacey. Argo is a regular to these events
and is the resident pre-washer of dishes, weighing in at a meager 80lbs;
a golden retreiver mix. Argo especially loves Bradley, who likes to 
experiment with Argo's digestive system, making my ride home always
a pleasure. This will be Lacey's first outing with this group - she
weighs in at around 100lbs; also a golden mix. If y'all thought Argo
liked table scraps, you will be amazed at her plate cleaning 
abilities. She is the most determined begger I have seen...don't leave
your plates around! They are both great with kids...my 12 year old
neighbor walks and spoils them everyday.

On an off the subject topic...for those in the San Jose area...Adobe
is moving into our new tower right now...looking out at the smog filled
air from the 16th floor....this tower is kewl...uh-huh, huh-huh, ...
anyone out there need a unix job? We need unix peoples! I have learned
more about unix and networks over this weekend then I have in 10 years;
but unfortunately i have slept about 10 hours since thursday...woohoo!
