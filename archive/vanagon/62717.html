Subject: Any interest in an '83 Vanagon ?
Date: Wed, 13 Aug 1997 10:55:51 -0400

Our son may be selling his '83 Vanagon, brown and tan.  He hasen't decided
wheather to part it out or sell as is.  It does have a blown head gasket
but the rest is is good shape as far as I can remember.  It's located in
Baltimore. MD.  If you have any interest in it, e-mail me and we'lll pass
it on to him.
