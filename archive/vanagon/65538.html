Subject:      Gauge wiring and mounting, 82 vanagon westy

BTW, I also replaced the pressure relief spring since I had heard
that this was a common culprit.

OK, one more question for you tinkerers:  Where do I run the extra
wire from the sender to the gauge?  Up through the engine compartment
lid and through the interior?
__________
I just wired my gauges yesterday in my 82 westy.  I ran a set of 4 wires
(in case I add other gauges later) from the engine compartment out the
left side (facing engine hatch, FIF) along side of another wire cluster.
 It comes out of the engine compartment in the drivers  side rear wheel
well.  I ran these wires inside of a piece of 1/2 inch PVC tubing.(Drip
irrigation hose, Cheap)  I then ran these wires under the vehicle
following the other wires using nylon ties to secure the new wires set
to the existing one.  It barely fit through the frame in places but
I managed to get it in all the way into the dash.  I ran it up to the
front grill and into the dash area htrough an unused grommet near the
left headlight.

Now I neeed to figure out how to mount the oil press, temp and volts
gauge on the dash.  I may add another vanagon console over the ashtray
and mount them there.  This was a pain to do this way.  I had to loosen
the gas tank to work it through that area.  I found that a sewer snake
works real well to fish the wires along.  These are now out of the way
and look very professionally installed.

How hard was replacing the pressure relief spring and where do you
access it?  I know check the Bentley.

I screwed up my sump plate by using the template that came with the
sensor.  It showed the hole just off from one of the screw holes.  This
did not work.  The next plate I drill I plan to drill the hole midway
between the two screw holes and midway from the bump to the edge.  Hope
this makes sense.

Have some fun, I'll be gone all next week so I will be incognito.
