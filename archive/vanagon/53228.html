Subject: Re: Forget the Drums, How do you get the Lug nuts OFF!

On a parts '73 I once had to use my 3/4&quot; drive socket (after breaking 
a 19mm Craftsman) with a 6+ foot cheater and my 225+ lb frame,
you guys work the numbers.  The bolts came the studs did not shear.
I was trying to get at the front calipers and wheels, both of which 
ended up fairly unuseable.  On the '85 the fronts came easily at 350+
ft lbs.  Took a 4 ft cheater on the 3/4&quot; drive 19mm socket.  Again 
the bolts were fine.  It amazes me what some of these tire shops do.  
One of the first things I do after getting a van is ensure I can get 
off  all 4 wheels then tighten them with the factory wrench, a very 
good idea for anyone.
