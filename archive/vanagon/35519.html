Just thought I'd tell everyone, that new job as genuine rocket scientist
is going well, progress on my MSME thesis is not.  Very busy as I've just
picked up 2 bays, a 77 parts bus, and a great body solid 78 that unfortunately
just had been under 5 feet of H20.  Total cost for both $600, and the engine and
interior from the '77 will promptly go into the '78, at which time the 77 is
going to be junked.  If anyone needs something little, I'm taking
windshield  but most other glass available, I'm retaining tranny, and
all fi and heater fan,
as well as axles and cv's.  Front axle is beginning to rust out though,
now I know there is not much left but if there is something you need give a yell.
May also pick up a '60 Bug that has surfaced in the solid (for WV) but unrunning
range, asking is $1000 but I'm dickering hard.  It was a cosmetically restored
daily driver till 1 year back then had problems and un mechanically
inclined owner gave up, but I couldn't get her to start either, still
he has an extra 36hp and I have one I bought last year as well so who knows?

Later everybody
