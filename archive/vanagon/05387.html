Subject: Smog laws and LPG conversions

To: Air-Cooled Volkswagen Discussion List

We don't (yet) have smog or emission conformity laws/regulations in Australia. 
Our RWC's (Road Worthiness Certificates) are largley based around mechanical
aspects relating to vehicle safety - brakes, glass, lights, suspension, exhaust
etc etc.

Are conversions to liquid petroleum gas (LPG - a by product of the distillation
process) available in the U.S? What ids the price of LPG (if available)? As I
understand it any engine running on LPG will met the most stringent emission
laws because no lead and 'minute' levels of hydrocarbons are produced....

LPG conversions are gaining in popularity in Australia because petrol
(gasoline) sells for around 70 cents a litre in metropolitan areas (and more in
remore areas - convert to price per gallon and *GULP*).  LPG sells around 20
cents per litre.  

The down side with LPG is a loss in energy (around 15%) and the fact you have
to fit a 50 - 70 ltr gas cylinder in somewhere (although a range of cylinders
that can be fitted unobtrusively to various models have appeared in AUS).  We
run the slug (Ford wagon) on LPG and I have seriously thought about converting
the 76 bus....

Fuel injected and carby engines can be converted.  My brother-in-law fitted a
13B bridgeport rotary to his Kombi and had that running on gas too (not very
hard to do - the hassle being the cooling...) 

Unmodified engines can run on LPG but there are some valve/guide problems with
some older stock engines because LPG doesn't lubricate as well as petrol...but
modify an older engine with hardened valves, seats and guides and you're
cooking!  According to VW Australia most VWs after 72 can be run on LPG without
any mods......

I think the ideal situation would be to make the LPG mods, maybe accompanied by
a couple of performance mods (to compensate for the loss of energy associated
with the fuel) and never worry about smog laws (or having to go electric?)
again.....Any thoughts?
