Bodega Bay Dunes gathering        June 2-4th weekend

The following have already taken care of their reservations for the Dunes.  In 
front of the names is their expected arrival time at the Dunes:

9 pm    Steve/Linda Johnson     sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com 
? am    Jack Stafford           stafford_at_alcor.hac_dot_com
?       Lee Wood                Lee.Wood_at_Forsythe.Stanford.EDU
3-5 pm  Marcus/Jan/Ute Doherr   mgdoherr_at_ucdavis_dot_edu

? am    Bradley Prunehead       bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com

The following I've not heard from = unknown.  If you are unknown and have not 
yet arranged for your tix, you might want to join up with someone above and 
share their space.  We'll need at least 7 total I think, since Don Kane plans 
to use one space for his 2 cars (2 cars allowed per space)
