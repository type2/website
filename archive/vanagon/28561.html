Subject: FS near Toronto

I just got a flyer from Owasco VW in Whitby Ont, just E of Toronto. If
you're interested, it's 905-668-9383, fax: 905-668-9734, Ontario toll free
(voice) is 1-800-263-2676.

They state in the flyer that the Westy is no longer being imported into
Canada, and that they have no new ones left on the lot. But they do have a
bunch of used vehicles.

These vehicles are part of their annual camping fleet, so they've been on
the tourist trail. One can guess that they are all gasoline, automatic and
AC. They are all Westies, not Winnies. So if you want the newest possible
German-built Westfalia available in N Amer today, here's your list:

Yr      Colour  Km      Retail  Sale
94      Gray    45,000  40,235  28,500
94      Green   35,000  41,270  29,995
95      White   35,000  41,270  29,995
95      White   32,000  39,090  31,900
95      White   39,000  39,090  31,900
95      Green   31,000  39,090  31,900
95      White   24,000  39,090  32,500
95      White   41,000  39,090  29,995
95      White   34,907  39,090  31,900
95      White   25,538  n/a     32,900
95      White   25,000  39,090  32,500

All prices in Cdn $, which is roughly worth six bits right now. Though if
you want to buy Cdn $, then you probably have to pay $0.765. Talk to your
friendly international banker (in fact, if anybody is serious about doing
this, I can give advice on converting US into Cdn; with these sums
involved, a small fraction can save a couple hundred bucks)(Cdn residents:
call 1-800-661-3559 to talk to the Custom House Currency Exchange in
Vancouver; best rates. No I don't work with or for them).

If you're in the States, the 15% sales taxes (8% provincial, 7% federal)
should be refundable, but as to the rest of the paperwork (getting it into
the land of the gallons, miles and pounds) you're on your own, though
Owasco is a knowledgable and reputable dealer, so perhaps could help you
out. Also, some members of this list have imported from Canada and could
help out.
