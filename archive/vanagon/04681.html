I am posting this for another person.  Please reply to the email address
given below, if you are interested...

                    Water Boxer Motor sale

I have a 1985 Water Boxer motor that I took apart and cleaned up and was
going to rebuild.  The shop I worked at closed up and I never got to
rebuild it.  I have the whole motor plus intake, all cleaned and ready
to rebuild.  I have new bearings,rings and most of the gaskets.  I'll
never get a chance to build it now.  I'd like to sell it before it grows
to many cob webs. 

If interested make me an offer and send me e-mail at bn25_at_andrew.cmu_dot_edu
