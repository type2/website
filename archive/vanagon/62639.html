Subject: SURVEY,Job opportunity in VW Parts and Repair shop.

Listees,

  I posted a similar post about a year ago, I got Very Little response?

  I'd like to hear from anybody who might fit into the operation in our shop.  We have 
a busy front counter and do quite a few repairs.  We would need a person that is 
knowledgeable in parts, and that knew about the service end too.  Not working on but 
how they work.

  We don't use a computer system, we hand write all Counter tags, as well as the RO's.

  I'd like to see if anyone is out there looking for a change and might want to 
&quot;Relocate&quot;?  I'm sure a number of things need to be considered in a move like this, 
but we'd entertain having a person work a 2 week stint and see if it works for them &amp; 
us?

  AGAIN, I'm taking a survey, we're not looking or ready to make a move right this 
second, but checking to see if the right person is out ther somewere?  E-mail me back 
if this sounds like something you'd want to do for a living?  We're 70 miles south of 
San Francisco on the North end of the Monterey Bay.

  Kyle
