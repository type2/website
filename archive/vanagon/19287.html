Rando,

You should try a few things before you give up...at least dont let this happen to another fellow. 

Call your BBB, the local news, Attorney general, write a letter to all these, let it be known that you were ripped off and manipulated by this shop. I wouldnt be surprised it the the shop had your Micro stolen. 

Maybe you will not get your Micro or money back, but you would certainly make sure that this shop goes down and another VW lover doesn't get ripped off!


ALso let everyone know the name and place of this shop so we never go to it! In my case I can tell you all to never, ever, go to BENSON dealers in New Orleans, Louisiana.
