Subject: Re: how do I tow a bus?!?

&gt; No, more like suicide.  I _did_ pull my 71 home about 10 miles with a &gt;
similar rig.  Wouldn't recommend it. &gt; &gt; Custom fabrication would be the
way to go.  Where are you located? IN Northern California near Redding,
CA. There are plenty of welders around here. Maybe I need to track one of
them down and buy a junk front bumper to give me something to work off
of...  Thanks for your feedback. 
Robb
