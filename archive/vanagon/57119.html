&gt;Anyone have any sources for the Multimeter US 1119 as referenced in the
&gt;Bentley, and the price range?

in some VW documentation i have, it is refered to as a Fluke model 88 or
87. price is about $300. :( &lt;according to the Fluke catalogs&gt;

&gt;When draining and refilling the transmission with gear oil, what is the
&gt;size of the hex head wrench that is used?  Is this just a big alan wrench
&gt;or is it a special hex head socket or adapter?

17mm. it's a hex head socket or wrench. but you can get by with using a
bolt of the proper head size ... get an ordinary bolt with a short thread
shaft on it, and two nuts that fit on it. thread the nuts all the way up
and tighten them against each other. then put the bolt head into the
drain plug and you can turn the whole mess with a normal box end wrench or
open end wrench or even an adjustable wrench. :)
&lt;nope. i didn't think of it first. :)
