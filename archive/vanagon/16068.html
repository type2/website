Based on our 82 experience here is one method. There are many
variations in configurations over the three years and around the
country based on where the cat and the EGR are located. These differences
change the left exhaust manifold configuration and heater box design
specifically. We needed the left exhaust manifold for the 82 and were
quoted a price 300+ for an OEM replacement. Your best alternative is to locate
a wrecker with all of the required parts and have them remove the parts
for you. We paid 50 for the exhaust manifold. But the catch is you must
make sure that all the components match the existing system perfectly. The
Haynes
manual has a pretty good blow-up of the possible configs and variations.

You would think that there would be an after market for these items - but
I believe even JC Whitney does not stock the cast iron parts for these
years - just the muffler.....DC
