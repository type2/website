Subject: re &quot;Eurovan Can't Get Hitched&quot;

&gt;We have a friend that needs a bike rack for a 1997 Eurovan for a cross
&gt;country trip.  He was told in Phoenix that his Eurovan could not have a
&gt;trailer hitch attached to it, so therefore they could not mount a bike rack.

Well then I guess I'll take that hitch I got at a VW dealer right on off 
of my EV and &quot;untow&quot; the various Things (all '73) back to where I picked 
them up.

The EV does indeed have hitches designed for it.  Mine's a class 2 
manufactured or labeled as Da'Lan.

Check with several dealers or U-Haul.
