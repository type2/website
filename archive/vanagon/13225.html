&gt;Yes, I saw this Uniroyal tire last weekend at Price Club too. I just wasn't
&gt;sure if Uniroyal is a good reliable brand. The tire's load range is class C.
&gt;ANybody any comments about Uniroyal? Price club's price is unbeatable.
&gt;I'll probably go for it in a few days.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, Erik.

David,
I have no idea what their light truck tires are like (other than vanlist-
opinion), but many years ago I bought Rallye 280's (or was it 340's?) for 
my 78 Scirocco, and they were the best damn tires I ever had on that car.
Better than the Pirelli's it's got now...

And now back to your regularly scheduled programming.

Joachim
