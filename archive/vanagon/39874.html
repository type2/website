Subject: Re: More Parts from the Stash

&gt;        I'm thinking about hauling all this junk to the next swap meet and
&gt;selling everything for $1-$10, just to get rid of it.  Having thrown the
&gt;obviously broken stuff away, I have a good sized collection of parts, most
&gt;of which are useless to me.

Thom,

I am in a situation exactly like yours, and this is just what I am doing.

Last fall word came to me through the grapevine that a local person
was 'getting out of the VW business' and getting into '30s Fords.
He has a 20x40 foot shed full of car parts, mostly VW. I got the 
whole lot of it, nearly 5 full trips in the '71 BUs to get it all home.
My only exterior storage is an 8x12 shed, now approaching 5 feet deep in
engine blocks, tin, rear decklids, doors, spindle-to-spindle front
ends, etc. All from '60 to '67 Bugs. I had to pay a couple of bucks for the
whole pile, but I have sold a few things, and made my money back, so
I am even, and have saved this whole pile from the magnesium crucible
at the smelter. But, I still have about 1500 lbs of VW metal.

I am going to the Bugout on Memorial day. It costs me $50 to get a swap space.
All I am going to do is sell stuff for cheap until I make $60.
($50 for me, and $10 to get the wife in). Then I start giving it 
away. (Prob. wont make any friends with the other vendors...) My only
problem is getting it all in the Bus. I will prob. have to
remove both the middle and rear seats to get it all in there.

SO, if you are near a swap meet, just give it a try.

BTW, I would like to thank you personally and publicaly for your
inspirational posts, permeated with good craftmanship. Good luck on
the various 'projects.'
