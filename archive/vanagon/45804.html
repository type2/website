Subject: FWD: FS:VW bug centrifugal distributor

I suspect this is Bosch 009 in case someone wants it.

I know nothing, just saw it in austin.forsale

&gt; 
&gt; I have a Bosch centrifugal advance distributor that I used to use on a
&gt; 1200cc VW some years ago- it was working fine when I took it off, and I
&gt; don't really want to throw it away. If some VW owner wants it, $5 (or best
&gt; offer) takes it away. I have some other little odds and ends I'll throw in
&gt; with the distributor if you want them-(valve cover gaskets, carb rebuild
&gt; kit, etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; Call me at (512)453-6766, or send e-mail if interested.
