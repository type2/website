&gt; Anyone have experience with these tires?  What are other EV'ers using for

Ken:

I'm one of those who didn't say nope, and am running the non-reinforced
Michies.  About 23K miles so far and no problems.  I'd prefer the
reinforceds but they weren't available when I bought mine, and the Contis
were coming apart (lousy tires, at least mine were).
