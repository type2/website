Subject: Bearing Noise Found - how to solve?
Date: Tue, 3 Oct 1995 11:52:53 -0700 (PDT)


I found the source of the wierd noise in the front right wheel.

The seal is rubbing on the return spring.  It doesn't look the the spring
is sticking out too far, maybe the drum is pushing the seal back too 
far.  I can see shiny spots on the spring where its been rubbed, and part of
the plastic coating on the seal is already gone.

Any ideas?
