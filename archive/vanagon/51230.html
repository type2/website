Subject: Re: need a back-up light switch

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I believe that the back-up light switch on the transmission on my '81
&gt; Westy is bad.  The symptoms:  The backup lights will come one but only
&gt; if I hold the shifter lever all the way up in reverse.  If I take my
&gt; hand off the lever and let it rest in its normal spot, the lights go
&gt; out.  
&gt; 
&gt; Now, would this be a switch problem or what?  I guess a way to test
&gt; would be to pull the wires off the switch and ground them.  If the
&gt; lights come on, the switch is faulty, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have any ideas of what else it might be?  If it's the switch,
&gt; where can I get a new one?  I haven't seen them in the WCM catalog and
&gt; there are no foreign FLAPS around here.  Does RMMW have a Vanagon
&gt; catlog?  Where do you Vanagoners get your parts?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all the help (this should be relatively simple to fix
&gt; compared to the sink :)
&gt; 
&gt; Take care,
&gt; Sean
&gt; 
   Sean,
   Check the switch to make sure it's not loose. If that not it,
   remove the switch and clean the plunger. Maybe a cheap fix.
