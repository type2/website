It was said &quot;if anyone can answer the above previously posted message i would
love to
hear about it! i think the mysteries of the universe would be revealed&quot; to
which I reply:=================

Heck - I have enough trouble convincing the wife that the spares n' stuff I
keep in the garage to do fast turn-around repairs on cars and house are
essential.  What goes un- recognized is that w/o this stuff, you wait until
the stores open on Monday (takeing time off from work), the parts dept. can
order and receive, and or the mechanic/plumber/carpenter/electrician can find
the time to get out to you.  I LONG ago concluded that acquiring spares and
projected replacement parts, tools and consumables was a solo activity.

(Heck -when you are waiting for a cloud to move or the sun to change angle
just a bit so that a run of the mill photo will become a great photo and you
get heckeled to &quot;hurry up and take your stupid picture, the kids are getting
restles/grumpy&quot;  you don't even consider a family outing to find parts!!)  :)
