Subject: Re: 1987 Head gasket, replace once or more?

Wow, we are supposed to replace the head gaskets periodically?  I'd
better do this, since both of mine are still original ones and both
have well over 100k.  Didn't know it was a maintenence item.

I don't know, but I suspect that these are a problem area -- like it
is not uncommon to do this, but it is much more common not to.  If
you like the car, have it checked out by a competent repair-critter
and buy it if it's right.  Even Vegas didn't *all* break at 50k!

The price seems ballpark, i'd certainly have considered it.

Humble opinion
