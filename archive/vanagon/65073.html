Joe,
how did you do it?
        i need to know.
        if you have to put a cushion over the trunk, like the weekender,
        i won't be able to do this because of the modified engine cover.

this is the idea:
        get a cheap fold out sofa/bed or fold out love-seat/bed and start
        tearing away at it until just the frame and the mattress part is
        left. then get a back seat from a 1984 junker and cut it apart
        for the mounting system.  attach the mounting brackets and
        supports onto the sofa/bed frame, and make hardpoints for the
        seat belts to attach to.  then take the middle seat out, and fold
        out the bed.  (is this idea plausible?)

please tell me how you did it.
