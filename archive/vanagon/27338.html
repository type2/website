Subject: ? on shift rod coupling
Date: Tue, 24 Oct 95 8:50:33 MST

Rev. Bob was speaking of shift rod couplings recently and was
warning against the cheapie sets and to make sure to get an 
OEM one.....I installed the cheapie about 5 years ago [well, the
cage to the cheapie, since I wasn't impressed with the rest of
the kit], and now I'm having some shifting problems [like sometimes
I can get into reverse without pushing down], though I haven't 
crawled under the bus with my wife wiggling the gearshift to 
diagnose this fully.

Anyway, how does one specify the OEM type coupling to avoid getting
the JCW knock-off, and are these available for the breadloaf era.

Many thanks
