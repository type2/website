&gt;&gt; Hi California people,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My request is pretty simple. I'm trying to get hold of a CA state sticker.
&gt;&gt; You know the type you stick in your rear windshield to tell people where
&gt;&gt; you come from (as well as your plates).

&gt;Hmmm... never seen one of those... at least not the oval type like the
&gt;country stickers.  Just big, gaudy, red-and-blue-and-purple reflective
&gt;ones with pictures of Sea World on them.  Or Redwoods.  You probably
&gt;wouldn't want those.  :)

I've not seen them either; but then I guess that's why they're country
stickers (as opposed to state stickers).
There are those California Republic flag stickers, they're some-
what tasteful, how 'bout one of them?
Otherwise, you can always mangle your Swiss sticker (CH) into
a CA... (NOT!)

Norman
