&gt;&gt;An informed discussion and/or pointers to 12v solar panel stuff would
&gt;&gt;be interesting.  Now that summer is here I'd love to implement a solar
&gt;&gt;powered ventilation system.  Anyone seen such?

Well, David Schwarze started it and I'm following into his footsteps. We
both have a set of 4 solar panels, each 1 by 4 ft. in size.  The set is
rated at 87 Watt. David has his already installed, while I'm struggling to
find time on a rainless day. 
   
   Very cool! Do you intend to add batteries to store collected energy
   or use the existing battery only?

of fun and sun -- and YOU set up the gig!  Ack.  It is bad to NOT be
the queen!  You had better make sure that the dude (is it Jeff?) does
something nice for you in Cabo to make up for this heinous transgression.
Maybe there will be some justice in the world and it will rain all morning
on the other people while you are waiting -- and when you arrive, the sun
will burst out in all of its glory.  

I am familar with Dilbert.  I think he is a local guy -- I read an article
on the dude who draws Dilbert, but I can't remember the details -- must
be too much toast ;).

I made the best meal in the entire world last night (please hold the 
applause).  This is the only night this week that we could have a good
sit-down meal, so I catered to Alix's whims (as usual).  She wanted 
steak and mashed potatoes.  So I bought some good steak, marinated in
red wine, fresh crushed garlic, soy, pepper, and rock salt.  Made mashed
potatoes with roasted garlic and lots of butter.  Grilled the steaks on 
the barbecue.  And made blanched spinach with bacon.  Topped it off
with some gooey pastry.  While it probably cut 6 months off of my life,
it was FABULOUS.  We just jelled the rest of the evening in a food coma.
As always, I thought of you when I was garlic-ing :).

I am a busy boy today.  Work until 5:30.  Traffic school from 5:45 'til
9:30.  Gig at a hell-hole called &quot;Velvet&quot; from 10:00 until 2:00.  What
a miserable exisitance.  Traffic school is . . well, traffic school.  I
wasn't even smart enough to go to the &quot;Laff 'n Learn&quot; traffic school.
I'm going to the cheap, dullard traffic school.  Ack.  And Velvet is 
truly a shit-pot.  It only holds 50 people and the stage is so small
that I actually have to stand close to the idiots in my band.  The 
crap I put up with.  We are doing this gig for some woman promoter that
is trying to get a career going.  I get the feeling she is just looking
for some young musician types to have sex with.  She has her eye on 
our lead singer.  I would tell him to sleep with her, if I thought she
could do anything to help us.  Alas, she is a loser.

Our lead singer (Don is his name -- 'though I call him &quot;Jim Vedder&quot;, i.e
Jim Morrison crossed with Eddie Vedder) was telling me how excited he
is that we will soon be traveling across the land, playing music to
the masses, and making lots of money.  The dude is so delusional, it's
scary.  The band sucks.  Unless there is a great calling for bands that
suck, I don't think we are going to be spreading the gospel of Bump.
The extra scary thing is, the guy is 29 and wants to be a high school 
teacher.  He has failed the teacher test 4 times.  You don't have to be
a rocket scientist to pass the test.  I won't even get into his problems
with women -- let's just say, I won't be trying to set you up with him
anytime soon.  Unless you are looking for a good looking, but needy, quick
shooting, emotionally dependant, dolt.
     

Gotta run,

Anthony
