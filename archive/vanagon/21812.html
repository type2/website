  The oil cooler and filter mount can both be accessed with the engine in
  the car. After removing the rearmost pieces of tin, remove the fan and
  the four bolts that secure the fan housing will be exposed. Don't forget
  to undo the cable from the thermostat before taking off the fan housing
  which can be removed with the alternator and coil still attached to it 
  &lt;wires undone, of course&gt;. Oh yeah, there's one more bolt on the left
  side where the oil cooler support bracket attaches to the fan housing.

  It's amazing how small the engine looks once the fan housing is removed.
