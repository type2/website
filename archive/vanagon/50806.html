&gt; Trouble is, I can't get my hands or even a finger down inside the battery
&gt; compartment to get it out.  The battery just barely sits inside the comparment.
&gt; There is no handle on the battery, and nothing to grab on top but the posts.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone reccommend a neat trick to get the bugger out of there?  How about a
&gt; trick to make sure that it will be easy to get it out in a few years should I
&gt; need to replace it again?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.

Greg,

I have a battery puller taht looks like a strap with a hole on either
end.  The holes go over the posts and the strap becomes a handle.. It's
an old tool, got it from my Dad.  The downfall is that you're lifting
the battery by the posts.
