Subject: Re: vanagon crew cabs

Here in Santa Cruz we have two of these wonderful Crew Cab Vanagons. 
 One of them we (Volks Cafe) work on the other I'm not sure if the owner 
does his own work or if it gets done in the valley.

  Our customer has a White crew cab he bought in Canada had it imported 
and then installed a 3.1 Ford V-6 engine in it.  This thing really has 
quite a bit of power!  The work that was done to install the Ford engine 
is quite extensive, Copper pipes for the cooling system Ect.

  I do belive that I forgot a very important part about this vehicle, 
It's a Syncro!  other than some surface rust it's a great VW.  I want 
one TOO!

  Just thought I'd share this with the list.
