Oh, and one more thing:  

Find a good mechanic!  This is crucial, I've had some bad ones AND have
been taken once for a very big and unjustified bill.  You might ask
someone on this list for a good mechanic in your area.  If you're in the
Los Angeles/Orange County area of Southern California, I can tell you a
great mechanic and a place to avoid.

&gt; 
&gt; Matt,
&gt; 
&gt; Here's something to maybe look out for more than what specifically to
&gt; buy:
&gt; 
&gt; I bought a 1979 Westphalia about two years ago.  It's a good car but
&gt; there have been a few expensive repairs.  I would just say that if
&gt; you're going to go for one of the older ones--and unless you
&gt; specifically want to love an older one, don't do it--make sure to take
&gt; it to Volkswagen and get a full diagnostic checkout.  They're built to
&gt; last but old cars are old through and through and there are just a lot
&gt; of things that just need to go bad after a certain number of years no
&gt; matter how good they're built, no way around it, from transmissions to
&gt; wheel bearings and little rubber thingies and seat covers.
&gt; 
&gt; So if you're looking for a functional travel machine off the bat, I'd
&gt; really suggest getting as new a van as you can.  An old van well taken
&gt; care of is certainly better than a beat up newer van, but all things
&gt; being equal, go with the newer model.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck and welcome!
&gt; Erik
&gt;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm a new subscriber to the list (and to the type2 list).  I've
&gt; gotten
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; into my head that it would be fun thing for me and my wife and three
&gt; &gt; young
&gt; &gt; kids if I bought a VW camper... but I have no idea what I want/need.
&gt; &gt; I have
&gt; &gt; looked at the vanagon_dot_com website and some of the other VW web
&gt; &gt; resources,
&gt; &gt; but I'm still not sure...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For anyone with a little time and patience, maybe you could give me
&gt; &gt; some
&gt; &gt; guidance, on or off list.  I'm interested in spending $5-$10,000 for
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; VW
&gt; &gt; camper with stove, fridge, sink, and other camping equipment (as
&gt; much
&gt; &gt; as
&gt; &gt; possible), and I would like to buy something with character and
&gt; &gt; personality... We owned three VW's when I was a kid (2 bugs and a
&gt; &gt; thing),
&gt; &gt; and I have very fond memories...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Am I looking for a type2?  What year models are type2's?  Am I
&gt; looking
&gt; &gt; for a
&gt; &gt; Vanagon?  Either generally?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any advice, including references to basic VW resources, would be
&gt; much
&gt; &gt; appreciated.  TIA.
&gt; &gt;
