Bill Killian, getting a bit argumentative and defensive, wrote:

&gt;Noisy?  First complaint I've ever heard about a EV being noisy.  We get
&gt;noise from the A/C but not awhole lot of engine noise.  The Winnebago
&gt;conversion - I'm assuming you mean the one sold at VW dealers not the
&gt;Rialta sold at Winnebago dealers is a full foot maybe two longer than the
&gt;'regular' EV.  The EV is almost assuredly nimbler than the Vanagon.  A
&gt;longer test drive might have shown that to you.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm VERY disappointed.  My Westie is getting (how shall I say?) a bit 
long
&gt;&gt; in the tooth now.  I like a QUIET car, and the Vanagon is one.  The 
Eurovan
&gt;&gt; is decidedly not.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't like one don't buy one.  I did like it I did buy it. I'd do
&gt;it again.

Oh, I won't, don't worry.  It's STILL underpowered, but now it's also 
horribly overpriced, and considerably less pleasant than my increasingly 
decrepit '86.  But I will certainly criticize whatever I feel deserves 
criticism, and I feel quite strongly that the Eurovan deserves it.

I drove the little one, not the &quot;real&quot; Winnebago.  You know, the one that 
pretends to be Son-of-Westie.

VW has taken the Vanagon, a truly unique vehicle that filled a niche that 
suits my needs to a &quot;T&quot;, and replaced it with the Eurovan, a very 
run-of-the-mill (ugh) MINIVAN, except that it's inferior to its competitors 
in many, many ways like fuel economy, power, handling, reliability, noise, 
etc., etc., etc.  It's only redeeming feature is that it remains taller than 
its competitors and still offers that wonderful commanding field of vision - 
SUVvies in front of you don't bother you.  But it has lost almost all of its 
other virtues, virtues that made me a lifelong fan and that made me envy 
those who could afford Westfalias when I couldn't.  Now that I can afford 
one, I feel betrayed.

When I first saw it at the 1992 Auto Show I was deeply saddened, because I 
knew that I would now never be able to purchase my dreamcar (Westie) new. 
 When I drove the Eurovan Camper (not &quot;around the block,&quot; but about 300 
miles, trying somehow to learn to ignore its fatal shortcomings),  I tried 
to convince myself that the superior stereo system would somehow compensate 
for the unpleasant growl of that surprisingly rough 5-cyl right there by my 
shins, but the annoyance never faded.  I really wanted to like it.  I was 
ready to buy it right then and there.

And, more importantly, it just didn't &quot;feel&quot; right.   It didn't say, &quot;I'm 
YOUR car and will be faithful to you.&quot;  If you don't understand this, you 
should be driving a Dodge Caravan.

My old Westie hasn't slowed below 50 mph yet on any stretch of Interstate 
unless I told it to.  I imagine that it might have trouble with 70 west out 
of Denver (what wouldn't?  My old '72 negotiated the Eisenhower Pass at 20 
mph, but made it through with its head held high), but it has NO trouble 
with the National Highway west of Cumberland, which I have driven many 
times.

I'm glad you like yours.  I hope it is good for you.  Personally, though, I 
mourn the passing of the Vanagon - a truly superior and unique vehicle.  I 
hope to find an ALMOST unused one someday.

Woody
