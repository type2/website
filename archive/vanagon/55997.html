Subject: '67 Resto ~ on the road Saturday!

Yea! The '67 Restoration from Hell will be going through emissions [ =( ]
and coming home on Saturday. Final assy of the the front door panels and
kicks, installation of the curtains, minor stuff and assy of the Westy rack
over the weekend, then some minor break-in drives prior to the Corona de
Tucson next weekend. See ya there!!!
I am currently talking to the &quot;Coyote&quot; about getting the CCC's and the
VanBondo Trapp family Singers together during the April 5-6 Kelly Park show
near San Jose. Barring the unforseen, we'll be there as well.

AZ license plate &quot;67 RFH&quot; ? ;-)

Mucho thanks to all of the listees who have helped out especially Micheal
Heron, &quot;Mr.&quot; Hoover, Clara Williams, Kevin Murray, Jim &quot;Synchrohead&quot;
Davis&amp;family as well as Nick Felegy at &quot;VWPIECES_at_aol_dot_com,&quot; Dave Easterwood
and Allen Becker, Jason and Jeff at neener_at_texas_dot_net, Blue and Jean-Ray, the
CCC's for the constant harrassment, Tom B. at the NEATO org. and Bank of
America.
Most of these connections would not have been possible without GerryS. and
KenH. Thanks for not unsubbing my smart aleck behind off of the lists!
