Subject: Screens for a Vanagon?

I have a '71 Riviera conversion camper.  It has a screen that goes in the
back when you open the rear hatch. This, along with the side window screens
keeps it fairly cool in the summer for camping. 

Now, I also have an '80 Vanagon. I installed the weekender package (fold out
bed) in the rear of it. Does anyone know if the same screens are available.
Perhaps someone has some they'd like to sell. Or, another thought, I
borrowed one from a friend's Westfalia to use as a pattern for the one in my
Riviera. Maybe I could work this out for the Vanagon?
