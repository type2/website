Subject: EV &quot;Winnie&quot; VR6 sighting

Yesterday I saw a parked Eurovan long wheelbase model with Winnebago pop
top conversion. It had windows on all sides but the left rearmost third.
Was all white including the front grill and looked nice. Most interesting
was the emblem on the front said &quot;VR6&quot;. I didn't realize they are putting 6
cyclinder engines in these, thought it was a 2.5L 5 cylinder. Is this
something new? Also it had an additional grill on the right front fender.
