Subject: lifting syncros for bleeding radiator

What's the best way to lift the front end of a syncro the required 40mm for 
bleeding the bleeding cooling system? Bentley indicates that you need to rig 
some sort of support to allow a floor jack to lift at both front jack points 
on the crossmember. But syncros have that extra skid plate stuff giving only 
9.5&quot; of clearance. Using a 4x4 (wood) support leaves maybe 5&quot;-6&quot; for the 
floor jack which seems kinda tight. Might work, but I'd like to get some 
feedback from those that have done this before I embark down this path. 
Another idea I had was to get a couple of drive-on ramps, but the biggest I 
can find raise the vehicle only about 11&quot;.
