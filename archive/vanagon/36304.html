Subject: Re: '57 Mystery Deepens!


&gt;the number behind the passenger seat  (is it still on the right side of the
&gt;bus on RHD?) is the BODY number.   it is different than the CHASSIS
&gt;number/VIN.    I dont know why.  On bugs, the body can be taken off the 
pan,
&gt;and the title holds to the number on the pan.   as someone said, they can 
be,
&gt;and are, switched around sometimes.    actually (useless trivia)  whole bus
&gt;bodys could be orderd from the factory, in primer.

Up in Thule, Greenland (where I was priveleged to spend a few exciting
years), a ram-tough Dodge suburban-type vehicle ran off the road and
wound up with a bent frame.

Acting with government  efficiency, the base mechanics did the following:

1.) Order a new frame from factory. Yes, the WHOLE thing.
2.) Bring afflicted vehicle into a large, spacious shop.
3.) Get LOTS of tools.
4.) ...

Do you see what's coming? They actually disassembled the entire
vehicle, and built it back up on the new frame. Don't know what labor
costs were charged to the gummint, or how many brand-new vehicles
they could have bought with that money...

BTW, there was a bus sitting up there, 68-71 I think. No wheels or engine,
but otherwise appeared complete. Probably still there. This is also near
where the B-29 Kee Bird sat for 50 years until recently, R.I.P.
