Subject: Volkswagen Blues

Hi everybody. I've been absorbing all the information from this list for 
the past few months and I must say that it has helped me quite a bit. I 
just wanted to thank everybody for their knowledge. I just finished 
reading a book called Volkswagen Blues, written by Jacques Poulin. It's a 
story that you'll all enjoy if you haven't already read it. Two friends 
travel from Quebec across the States to the West coast. They travel in a 
'68-'72? Westy, not sure exactly what year, but it's really quite a good 
book. It discusses many of the quirks of owning a VW van like gas heater 
problems, roadside repairs, mountain passes and the joy of having a home 
away from home. It was originally written in french but the version I 
read was in english. The ISBN # is 0-7710-7158-2. It is published by 
McClelland and Stewart in Toronto. Hope you guys check it out.

Now for a tech question. I have recently installed a new weber 
progressive carb kit into my '72 Westy. The only problem with the 
installation was the accelerator cable routing. It originally came thru 
the fire wall on the driver's side, but I needed it to come thru the 
passenger's side instead. I hooked it up but it is far from being smooth. 
Is it possible to purchase some kind of linkage to get smooth accelerator 
action? I'm sure there some of you out there that had the same problem. I 
need help.
