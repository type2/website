Hi everyone,
        I have a problem that is driving me absolutly crazy.  Here are
the symptoms:  Sometimes when driving the van loses most, say 80% to
100%, of its power.  As long as it remains in gear I can floor the gas
peddle and it will barely move.  As soon as I put the clutch in it will
usually die. Sometimes it will struggle to stay running at around 500rpm
before it dies.

Months) But I Am Leaning Toward A Fuel Delivery Problem (is. Fuel Pump).
A Quick Note Though... Depressing The Clutch Or Pulling Over And Idleing   
 For 10-15 Seconds Seems To Do The Trick For Me.  I Can't Blame The Bus   
Though... It Sat Neglected For 4 Years Before I Got It.
