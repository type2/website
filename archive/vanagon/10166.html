Subject: [f] for me!

&gt;From now on it's [f] in the subject header for me!  I get this list in
digest form.  I look through the subject headings and contributors and
read selectively.  You're right, certain long messages I completely
ignored.  I always read certain people, Jim Brill among others...  :-)
