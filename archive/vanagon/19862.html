I have used BarsLeak for the last 50k plus with excellent results in my
'85. I've mentioned this a couple times on the mailing list but have
received little comment. I think the tendency is to stay away from any
type of stop leak gunk out of fear that it might muck up the cooling
system. I have instinctively stayed away from the powdered aluminum
products out of such fears but the BarsLeak product has proven itself
to me.

p.s. I now have 128k on the odometer.

        Upside of this is: plastic aluminium MAY do as a 'temporary repair', 
it's lasted at least 10 months in my van so far. I'll let the list know if 
all the leaks go away after sealing the stud. If this is so then it might 
buy some time (1-2yrs?) for those of you who are cash short (like, ALL of 
us) when major leaks are going on. On the same theme, why can't our pitted 
in nicely, full threads there, just crooked and a bit too deep!  TIA  tim s.
