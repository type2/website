Subject: Help needed on trany

First let me thank everyone for there advice on the best way to replace 
 points on a type IV, the existing points and cap and rotor were gone 
 to the great beyond. Just curious but at a 400% increase in cost is 
 there a really good reason to use the rpm limiting rotor?

My Problem,
A little history is in order here, I purchased a 78 westie from a 
 broker for very cheap because it was &quot;jammed in neutral&quot; the engine 
 fired up but was lacking a muffler so it was hard to tell if there was 
 anything flying around inside,  I figure I can rebuild the engine and 
 transmission and still be dollars ahead. I tore down the nose cone on 
 the gearbox and sure enough the shift link was out of position, but 
 oddly enough the pull rod for 1-2 was in, so it should have been stuck 
 in 2nd but it would roll as if in neutral. I placed the rods in all 
 the gear positions and could watch the different shafts move correctly 
 when I rolled the wheels -huh. So I put it back together put on a 
 muffler, tuned up the ignition and it fires right up even sounds good. 
 Put it in first gear let out the clutch, nothing tried all the gears 
 same. Crawled under the bus backed off the clutch all the way and 
 still no movement. I am no resigned to the fact that I am going to 
 pull the engine and tranny this weekend unless someone can tell me 
 different.  I plan on doing a compression test to check things out 
 first and take care of a rebuild if necessary .  So what do you volks 
 think? What could be busted inside of the transmission, or perhaps 
 inside of my head, we could have an idiot factor in the making,  and 
 another item is best to check compression on a cold engine or a warm one?

Thanks 
Clay
