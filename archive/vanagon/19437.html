   Well, after being keyed the other day, of course my speedometer cable
finally decided to break, after wobbling for the last couple thousand
miles. Since negative energy was now abounding, I resolved to right the
whole situation. A friend with a Jetta had been whining about $100 plus
to replace his cable, so imagine my great pleasure to purchase the cable
and wheel bearing cap for only $17.00. Upon removing the old cable, my
friend and I discovered the meter was binding up a bit, so we decided to
remove it and check it out. Inspection showed 28 year old grease had
become rather gunky, and this was sticking things up. We cleaned and
replaced all the grease, and while we were in there, I replaced all the
faded colored plastic pieces that cover the indicator lights. We also
replaced all the bad bulbs, and then put the whole mess back together.
   Amazing! My speedometer now moves like a Rolex, and is well lighted,
and all my indicator lights are bright and colorful! It is definately a
good thing. And alll this for under $20.00, and a few hours time.
Certainly a good thing, and great refresher for Brownie and myself.
Richard
