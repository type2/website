Subject: What colour is freon?

Hi Everyone.  Well, I started up the van today in the garage, and I 
put on the a/c to run the compressor.  After a few minutes, I noticed 
some &quot;smoke&quot; from the one of the exhaust pipes (the back pipe that 
goes left to right).  After some time, I noticed some &quot;pinkish&quot; oily 
stuff on the concrete floor.  

Hmm.. the power steering is on the right side, and this is on the 
left side.  I couldn't find any source of the leak. 

After the engine had cooled down a bit, I crawled under the van to 
inspect. The only thing that is above that exhaust pipe is the a/c
compressor.  So, if it is the a/c that is leaking, is freon or 
refrigerant pink?  

Easily puzzled,

Harry
