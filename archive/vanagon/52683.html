Subject: help/trimming amount of mail
Date: Thu, 5 Dec 1996 09:43:50 -0500 (EST)

Have recently been reconnected to University e-mail.  It is becoming 
difficult to handle amount of mail coming from vanagon list.  Don't want 
to unsubscribe.  What options are there for managing volume of mail?  

Thanks,

Kelly Barthlow
