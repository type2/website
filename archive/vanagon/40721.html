&gt;Thanks again! We kinda of suspeted a converter problem. It started to rattle
&gt;a few weeks ago. I guess we'll need to replace it. Are there any aftermarket
&gt;converters or are we at the mercy of VW. By the way we forgot to include the
&gt;new brakes,and curing the fuel smell,and the new rear hatch supports,along
&gt;with the weather strippng on our list of things we've done. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

universal converters are definitly the way to go.  PFP (products for power)
has a full line of converters for all cars...  The difference between a
universal converter and a dedicated converter is that you pay a local guy a
few bucks to cut the old flanges off the old converter and have him weld them
onto the new converter.  In the long run after shipping and extra welding
labor you should be able to save a few hundred dollars over VWs extortion
prices.  I suggest to buy it over the phone from Teutonix _at_ 803.689.5431  or
FAX 803.689.6352  E-mail Teutonix1_at_aol_dot_com
