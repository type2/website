     Currently there are four 88-90 Westalia Automatics for sale in the bay 
     area.  I know they slow down an already slow vehicle, but I was 
     wanting feedback on longivity and reliability.  Also, does anyone have 
     an average price to rebuild an automatic transmission?
     
     Thanks
