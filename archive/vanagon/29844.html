&gt; BELIEVE me when I say I am not in this for financial gain.  Although
&gt; I do buy &amp; fix up &amp; sell several buses, I do it for my own pleasure.
&gt; I would rather sell a part for a fair price, or horse-trade, or give
&gt; it to someone if I felt it would give them more pleasure than it
&gt; ever would me.  I could never walk away from a deal snickering over
&gt; how I raped someone on the price.

Which leads me to an interesting and timely perhaps for me question,
is it moraly justifiable to try to pull one over on a sleazy, and
I do mean sleazy used car dealer.  We won't go into details but I may
be soon convincing the guy with the '84 he'd be much much better of
giving it to me for say $400 or so instead of the $1000.  Anyway
we'll see and if so I'm not personally going to lose much sleep, I'll be
way tooo gleeful.
