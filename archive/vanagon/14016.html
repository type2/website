Subject: RE: CONVERTING GERMAN DRIVER'S LICENCE

ps&gt;What's the problem with having a PROVISIONAL LICENSE for two years?

(regarding our question about what (if any) states or provinces will
automatically convert a German driver's licence)

No problem per se, just a lot of hassle - especially since being treated
like a driver that's never been licenced also means $150 in testing fees,
waiting periods to get a test slot etc; if some state or province will
simply convert Susan's German (or international) driver's licence, it would
avoid all that.  Since we plan to cruise around somewhere for a couple
weeks this spring anyway, it could be a simple solution if it's in the
area.
