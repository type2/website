On Fri, 23 May 1997 11:24:54 -0500 you said:
&gt;1st  position down - front wipers slow

uhhhh ... this should be &quot;intermittent&quot; on the front. it should wipe, then
wait about 10 seconds or so, then wipe again.

&gt;1st  position up - front wipers slow

ok.

&gt;2nd position up - front wipers fast

ok.

&gt;Pull back - washer - front

ok.

&gt;push forward - washer rear

hmmm. the rear wiper should also start wiping and keep wiping for about
10-15 seconds. then, if you do NOT push the stalk forward again, it'll
do it again in 10-15 seconds ... it's on intermittent until you push forward
again.

&gt;I can't seem to get the rear wiper to work, or any intermittent features.
&gt;Though at the down position, I do hear an occasional relay click.
&gt;Do I just have a dead relay somewhere?

that's what it sounds like to me. all the functions that seem to be controlled
by the relay (at least, the timer portion of the relay) are acting dead.
see if you can find someone living close by that will swap relays and see
if the problem moves with it. if so, get a new relay.
