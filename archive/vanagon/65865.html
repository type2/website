I searched all my FLAPS to no avail for cheap lifters. Finally found some
at an independent VW mechanic.
I believe the washer fluid reservoir is supposed to overflow if you try
to overfill it.

&gt;listees,
&gt;
&gt;i have been a vanagon owner for 5 months, and a list subscriber for a
&gt;couple of weeks.  and for what i have seen this is the most
&gt;appropriate
&gt;place to ask a couple of questions:
&gt;
&gt;is there a place other than the dealer where i can find a new pair of
&gt;the
&gt;hydraulic cylinders that keep the rear hatch open ?  what type would
&gt;you
&gt;recommend; original or aftermarket ?
&gt;
&gt;also, the front windshield whiper fluid reservoir has a major leak.  i
&gt;may
&gt;need to replace/reconnect the hose or the reservoir, or both.   what's
&gt;the
&gt;best way to access it ?
&gt;
&gt;yes, i'm saving to buy a bentley manual.
&gt;
&gt;thanks for your help.
