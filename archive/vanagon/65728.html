Subject:      Re: Stalling at Idle when cold

FWIW -

Let's try to remember that the Digijet Wasserboxer (83-85) uses an
Auxilary Air Valve.  The Digifant (86-91) does not.  Idle Stabilization
at cold or hot temps on these two FI types are handled somewhat
differently.

The reason for mentioning this is that in following this thread (or
threads), I was under the impression that the original poster (Dan Moy)
had a 86-later model (which is Digifant) with this problem and I have
become a bit cornfused with the solution suggestions.  OTOH, Wendy Silva
has (or had) almost the same problem happening with her 85 Westy (which
is Digijet) at the same time.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

And to all - please state the year of your Type 2/Vanagon/Eurovan when
presenting a future problem for us to comment/suggest on (Although most
do, some don't).  It makes life so sweetly simple (and I won't get
headaches when reading the post &amp; replies).

Thanks :-)
