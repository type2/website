&gt;Subject:	Fuel Injection Question
&gt;
&gt;I've recently bought a 1800cc type IV engine that supposedly runs. 
 It has
&gt; the 
&gt;fuel injection still on it, but someone has put a 009 Bosch 
distributor on
&gt; it.
&gt;Will this work? 
&gt;

I ran a 009 on my '77 2.0 liter FI motor for over a year.  It 
supposedly has a slightly different advance curve than the stock 
distributor for a F.I. bus, but if there was a difference I didn't 
notice it in actual use.  Just make sure that you time the motor 
based on the distributor that is on it.
