Subject:       EGR tube carbon removal

those of you that have a coke choked EGR tube AND want to remedy it 
to pass smog or save yer collective lungs may want to give this a try 
to open it up.

Fill the tube from both ends with ATF fluid (yeah, yeah. either Dexron or 
FA) and heat the tube with a propane (profane?) torch.  Watch for 
spewing ATF out the open end and keep your face away.  

This reportedly cleans out the carbon, though i haven't tried it
myself..  What *is* ATF anyway?  Is there anything it can't do?  Will 
it be found in the Varactor Drives of alien spacecraft?
