&gt; I figure this list has some (possibly geriatric) fans out there, and
&gt; I feel a lot of people are sitting on the fence as whether to see them
&gt; or not particularly hearing Townshend will/can play only acoustic.  

The show in Vancouver was very poorly promoted - I heard about it less 
than a week before the show. Still some tickets left too. Had I heard 
sooner, we might have gone... Oh well, maybe their next &quot;final tour&quot; 
;)
