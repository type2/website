Subject: Re: self-adjusting brakes?

&gt;I replaced the rear brake shoes on my '84 Vanagon GL.  The Bently manual
&gt;says they will self adjust and not to adjust the emergency brake linkage
&gt;until they do (I think).
&gt;A mechanic with VW said they won't self adjust, that you have to manually
&gt;adjust them through the backing plate adjusting hole. He said not to adjust
&gt;the emergency brake linkage, the brake shoe adjustment will take up the
&gt;slack.  I attempted this but seem to have had each turn returned by the self
&gt;adjusting spring and lever.
&gt;

  Yes the brake shoes Are self adjusting, BUT you must first adjust them
after installation!  Thru the baking plates.

  Then if your E-Brake is not up to par, adjust it.  The correct way to
adjust the e-brake is After you've adjusted the rear shoes correctly.
