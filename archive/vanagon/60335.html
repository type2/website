Mike,

I think this is good advice!!  This whole project could easily become a
$1,000 job.

&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; read the oil leak note, take it easy there.  To replace pushrod tubes the
&gt; heads need to come off.  I'd bet you'll also need a new head gasket, $30,
&gt; and if the heads are going south maybe a head/2. To get the heads off you
&gt; need to take off the exhaust pipes, which may lead to stripped
&gt; headbolts/broken pipes if old. Sorry to paint such a picture, but slight
&gt; problems could easily triple your bill, and once underway you are
committed.
&gt; There is no adjustment of the hydraulic valve lifters BTW (hasn't been
since
&gt; 1978).  I hope this mechanic is experienced in wasserboxers???
&gt; 
&gt; If the oil leak is a real pain and endangers engine life you might
consider
&gt; the following.  Take of the rock covers to get a good look at the tubes.
&gt; Degrease them thoroughly with GUNK etc and a tooth brush then figure out
&gt; which one(s) leak and where.  If leakage is from the (rusted) accordian
&gt; pleats you are pretty much beat. 
&gt; 
&gt; If it is around ends, past the seals, you MAY be able to 'lengthen' the
&gt; tubes by carefully pushing a knife blade in between the pleats and
wiggling.
&gt; This will push a bit harder against the seals.  Do a small bit at each
&gt; pleat, not all in one.  If the tubes are rusted they may tear/crack! 
Also,
&gt; if the heads are well degreased you can goop around the tube and seal it
&gt; onto the head/block.  This is not ideal, but may stem the flow somewhat.
The
&gt; goop will pull off eventually due to expansion of block etc.
&gt; 
&gt;   Having said all that, if you only have one or two dead tubes you can
buy
&gt; split tubes, ~$30/, which are easily installed....  remove valve cover,
&gt; remove two bolts holding entire rocker arm/shafts assembly and pull out
the
&gt; pushrod in the leaking tube. Rip out the tube, clean up seats and install
&gt; new seals then the split tube.  Then reassemble rockers checking that NO
&gt; BINDING has occurred.  Do this in your drive, takes an hour or so. Jack
the
&gt; van slightly on the side you are working on to tip the oil back into the
&gt; block. No need to crack the heads/exhaust off, or 'adjust' the valves. No
&gt; incidental damage likely either. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bye, Tim
