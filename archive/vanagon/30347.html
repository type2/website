&gt; &gt; easier. Permatex (you guys are talking about the brown colored I hope) is 
&gt; &gt; also perfect for the sealing of the two halves of an aircooled engine 
&gt; &gt; because as we all know there's no gasket for this. It should also be fine 
&gt; 
&gt; You are not talking about silicon I hope.  Silicon on the case halves is 
&gt; bad news.  It does a fine job of sealing but it squirts out and get pinched 
&gt; off when you put the case together.  These beads get loose and can wreak 
&gt; all sorts of havoc.  Leads to plugged oil passages/coolers etc.

  Not only that silicon requires such a high temperature to melt that it
is dangerous and could do serious damage to your case.  Most silicon
furnaces are in the Silicon Valley anyway and I don't want to have to take
my bus there just get some sealant for my case. Silicone is cheaper and 
only smells funny.  However I believe the sealant they are talking about 
is something called &quot;Aviation Forma-a-Gasket&quot; a thin tacky not very 
impressive light sealant.  I used the stuff everywhere when I re-built my 
2000 cc Pinto engine.  It is great for glueing the gaskets to the metal 
parts and not very intrusive.  It will most likely disapear if used on 
exhaust components.
