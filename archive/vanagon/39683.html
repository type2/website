Subject:       inspiration and new stats

Does anyone have a nice photo of a 71 camper (on a web page), which i 
can use as inspiration as endeavor my repair this summer.  Bruno (new 
name for the stats God) is a white camper hardtop. The closer to a 
Bruno for the photo the better.  Thanks ahead of time!!
