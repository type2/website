&gt; Hi California people,
&gt;
&gt; My request is pretty simple. I'm trying to get hold of a CA state sticker.
&gt; You know the type you stick in your rear windshield to tell people where
&gt; you come from (as well as your plates).
&gt;
&gt; I've got a fair collection European oval stickers like: D,A,CH,F,L,GB.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone would send me a CA oval sticker I would be glad to pay for
&gt; the postage etc. or could swap one of my stickers.
&gt;
&gt; Come to think of it, I'm interested in anything California for my Cal theme
&gt; Bus.
