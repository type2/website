Subject: DC Blizzard Report

     Bill Killian has documented how well his EV did in the recent
     snows we've had, here is how the Syncro Westie fared:

     Background: I measured 20.5&quot; of light powder in the backward. We live
     in a residential neighborhood, in kind of a &quot;bowl&quot;: the only way out
     is up a hill, take your choice of four. Stock 90 Syncro Westie, except
     for 27x8.5x14 AT tires, a moderately aggressive all-terrain tread
     (labled &quot;Baha Commanders&quot;; would they take snow performance into
     consideration when they designed these?). Front airdam removed.
     Acquired in August, this was our first time in significant snow.

     Derek Drew has mentioned negotiating 24&quot; of unplowed snow with the
     same tires *and* chains. (Check it out, thanks to Dave Schwarze, at
     (http://wuecon.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/vw/drew/drew-7.jpg ). So I felt
     I would be near the edge...

     After digging the puppy out, figured I would go for the worst case
     first, the infamous (in our neighborhood)  Westmoreland Avenue hill.
     The municipal government had been plowing the residential streets
     all night, but the city truck, a 4x4 Dodge with a snowplow, was parked
     at the bottom of Westmoreland, which was still untouched. We chatted
     for a bit. He wanted to go up, but thought  it risky, and was thinking
     about going around the block for a downhill attempt. I told him I
     wanted to try an unplowed hill, and so he backed out, and let me at
     it.

     Diff lock on, I put it in first (the granny gear) and proceeded up at
     a stately pace, running 3000 RPM. It was anticlimatic, really, we
     just went up the hill...until we came to the &quot;windrow&quot; of snow across
     the street at the top, where it intersected with a well-plowed main
     drag. We went into the icebreaker &quot;back and ram&quot; mode, and on
     the third try got onto the flat and level. The plow followed me!

     After having done the worst thing first, the rest of the snow driving
     was anticlimatic. Used my trusty towstrap to pull out a Ford Explorer
     that had managed to high center himself. Macho looking machine
     that Ford, and I'll bet he won't be telling his SO he was saved by
     a VW! Went to a partially plowed parking lot for a little more
     practice in unplowed stuff, as well as crossing larger berms from the
     plows. Got pretty good at pulling off single lane roads for
     approaching cars, and then just driving out of the drift/windrow,
     amazing all lookers, as well as myself.


     Thoughts for the Future:

     Got to get those chains for the LT27x8.5x14 AT tires.  Stores do not
     carry chains around here, and  JC Whipme offers a whole variety in
     sizes matched to specific tire sizes, but does not mention my tire.
     Their order-takers were not helpful. Any ideas what size chain to buy?

     Want that front diff lock.

     If I can't fit an Audi engine in, maybe I could lift the anti-lock
     brakes...
