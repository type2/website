&gt; its got dual Kadrons on a 1776cc motor.  The carbs need a rebuild and to

&gt; how and pay $10 for the rebuild kit, or just pay $200 to have a shop do 
&gt; it.  Also, whats a good repair manual? 

How do you know the carbs need to be rebuilt?  You might consider tuning
them first, but if the kit is only $10 I guess you might as well go at it.
Installing the rebuild kits isn't hard, but it helps to have a clean, brightly
lit place to work, and a can of carburator cleaner, the kind you can dip
parts in (minimum size one gallon, preferably 5 gallon), and also some of the
spray stuff.  Whatever you do, do it yourself - you will learn a lot and
save money too.  The best manual is supposed to be Bentley, but it isn't
cheap, and since the Kadron carbs are aftermarket, it probably won't cover
them anyway.  Good for everything else, though.  I get by with the Haynes
manual, and a couple of good engine rebuilding books.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW- Mustangs rule.  VWs rule.  89' GT /  71' bus

I think that makes four of us on the list now that own both a VW bus and a
Mustang.  Let's keep that trend going!!
