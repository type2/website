&gt; In the last year, fuel lines have been replaced, radiator

&gt; Should we go ahead with paying $2800 for a new engine or selling now 
&gt; before this van breaks us financially?  Van has logged 130,00 miles. If 
&gt; we sell, what would be a fair price in its unrunnable state? Thank you 
&gt; for any input.

    I seems to me that the area of the country that you are in is
    a big factor as to the fair market price!  Here in Western PA.
    the book value is always  high.
