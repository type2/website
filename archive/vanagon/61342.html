Subject: trans removal/install


Jeff et al,

I've removed and installed tranny's in '81 and '86 vanagons and have used
various jacks, floor and regular cylinder types. I followed Haynes/Bentley
methods basically. Two additional things I would recommend:
1. While the trans is out replace the pilot bearing in the end of the
crankshaft, it costs about $10.00. I had one go in Jan. once and that cost
me a combination of  3-4 days of freezing, towing, removing the engine and
trans (I didn't know it was the failed bearing that was preventing the
clutch from functioning so I took out the engine first).
2. When finally installing tranny have a friend back at the engine move the
crankshaft pulley back and forth with a wrench or socket while you push the
tranny back into position. It will go in much faster, I know this.
