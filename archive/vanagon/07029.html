Subject: RE:   Westy 3-Way Fridge Questions

Well after taking everyone's advice I was able to get the fridge to light.  
It took about 30 minutes of pumping and sparking to get it to light.  During 
the course of all of it there were a 3 flare ups through the flue ( kinda 
like backfires or when you leave the lid down on your gas grill when you are 
trying to light it, not quite as big though). 

 I was just about to give up trying for the night when I looked down and saw 
a little blue flame  in the window of the fridge!  Let it burn for a few 
minutes and turned it off and tried again.  This time it lit after just a 
few pumps and sparks.  The flow meter moved all the way to the green!  

I had run the fridge for a day and a half off 110V to test to see if it 
could cool.  When I got home last night frost had formed on the cooling fins 
inside as well as some ice in a container of water I had put in there.

The only question remaining is whether to drive with the LP running the 
fridge or to run it off of 12V.  If it takes much effort to light the fridge 
once you get some where then all the cold escapes while you are trying to 
light the thing !

Thanks again....
