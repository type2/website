Subject: trans leak
Date: Wed, 26 Oct 94 12:48:19 EDT

Mail has been pretty quiet lately...anyway, I am wondering what might
cause a small transmission leak on an 82 vanagon. The leakage is at or
near the front (read towards the front of the Van) but is not coming from
the fill plug. About six months I changed the fluid to 80W90 and iit was
fine until temps started to get cooler.Could this be partly due to the
thickness of the oil? I haven't seen many transmissions that don't leak so
I am not worried; just looking for advice or info.DC
