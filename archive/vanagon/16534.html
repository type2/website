Subject: Re: Outrageous Prices.

I happen to have seen each of these vehicles as they were restored. The 21
actually went for $27,000 but a political hassle ensued after the bidding in
which Barrett-Jackson told the seller that it was a &quot;owner buy back&quot;
sitiuation. This means that the buyer is stuck with the car and pays the
commision at the rate that it &quot;went for&quot;. It seems that possibly that there
was not even a second bidder but somehow the price was &quot;encouraged.&quot; I need
to be careful about what I say. Will say no more past this point. The
vehicles mentioned were perfectly done. Just at my level of restoring the
&quot;Resto from Hell&quot; I have spent MONDO dollars and the thing isn't even out of
the bodyshop. I plan on keeping and enjoying it when done. 
I used to laugh at the fools in the magazines that quote billion dollar
prices paid for the restos. The other typical story in the magazines is that
uncle Fred ,the world's best bodyman and engine builder, did the vehicle for
free 'cuz he likes me. I wasn't so lucky. Yeah sure, you can think that
you'll just get an OK paint job and slip in a motor and have fun. The fact
is that you will probably find hidden rust, body damage, cobbled wiring, a
broke/missing what ever (or whatnot cabinet!!!) and it will need
fixing/replacing. Body work is like photography. If it's done well then you
don't notice it - if it's done poorly then it'll stick out like a sore thumb! 
I admit that reality and responsibilities should be addressed and I will be
the first one to mention that some population of the vehicle lovers crowd
(all makes, models, and years)get obssesed, get sucked into politics, look
down their noses etc. and loose the point of having fun. The vehicles that
were mentioned in your post were done specifically for profit and were
purchased by large corporations for investment purposes. I'm sure that we
aren't in this crowd, but some folks need to bury money or loose it to
taxes. It's a weird world. I'm more pissed at the &quot;Big Boys&quot; that charge an
arm and a leg for the things that we could have bought only a few years ago
for reasonable prices. There are folks out there that I know for a fact are
hoarding the stuff and plan on pumping the prices ala the Hunt brothers and
the silver market. Look at the tool kits, roof racks and tents for examples.
Supply and demand. I agree that I'm sad that the market has gotten so goofed
up. I concentrate on keeping a balance on real responsibilities (spiritual,
family, job) and (generally) back away from vw politics and enjoy driving my vw.

&gt;Hell, with prices like this, I figure that I MAY just take
&gt;that welding and painting class at the community college.
&gt;Then go out and scour the junkyards and old barns of this
&gt;great land.
&gt;
&gt;Yahoo, Im sitting on a gold mine! (Or the ground, if I don't
&gt;weld up that rust spot on the seat tracks!)
