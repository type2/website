&gt;situation is, present cap (unknown if correct cap or not) leaks.  looks like
&gt;it's vented-maybe.  filler neck looks like a type 1, type 1 cap fits but not
&gt;sure about venting situation.  also, I've checked 'Stant' locking gas cap
&gt;books and they skip right over 71 model year indicating none available (?).
&gt;anyway, thot I'd check here first for anyone who's been down this road
&gt;before.  Joel?  71 looks like a unique year for bus gas cap I guess.

nah, i can't believe that. i think it's the same cap as the 68-70. i don't
recall anything peculiar about it. but it has been a very long time ago
for me.

for leaking, you might just want to try to fit some rubber sheeting or even
cork sheeting as a new gasket.

and while we are talking about fuel caps, do you vanagon volks know that you
can order a locking gas cap (for the early models who didn't have one)?
don't know what they cost nowadays, and you might have to keep another key
on the keyring, but ...
