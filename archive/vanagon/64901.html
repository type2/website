Subject:      Boiling over!

It's HOT in Texas in the summer!
Took VAnagon to mechanic who leaned it out so I could pass inspection.
When it came back and the guy shut it off I heard the sounds of coolant
boiling.  Overflow tank was overflowing!  Turned it back on and checked
the temp needle.  A little passed center, hot but it's been lots
hotter.  Heck, the fan wasn't even on.
So, kept on trucken, but it keeps happening.  'Course when cold the
overflow tank is dry, so I add water, so it can overflow again...

Think I ought to get my ratio of anti freeze to water back up again?

Now I realize that running leaner means running hotter, but still..
Also, he advanced the timing further than I had it...
TBill
