Subject:      re: height question

blarney_at_wwa_dot_com (Carolyn Cullen ) asked, 'what is the height of a
'70s westfalia, with stock tires, suspension,etc?'

My Type 2 1977 VW Owner's manual says in the dimensions section:

                               Station     Kombi      Camp-     Delivery
                               Wagon                 mobile        Van

Length, unladen in./mm ....   77.0/1955  77.0/1955  80.0/2032  77.2/1960

                              For all four models:

Length in./mm .............    177.4/4505
Width in./mm ..............     67.7/1720
Ground clearance in./mm ...      7.8/ 200

This height thing is a problem for me. There's no way I can fit my Westy
in the garage even if I let the air out of the tires, as I did once with my
'63 Kombi. (Its height is 75 inches.) A fabric car cover may be a solution
for me, driving only twice a week, but it would be awkward for a daily
driver.
