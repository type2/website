&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; While I'm biding my time until there is a convergence of funds and product 
&gt; availability on the Eurovan front, I've been watching a red and white bus 
&gt; next door to my sister in law's house grow moss.
&gt; 
&gt; Thinking this would be a nice bridge vehicle until the EV, I was wondering 
&gt; if I might get some direction from the list members regarding the 
&gt; following:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Where would I access the FAQ that would tell me what year this bus is? 
&gt; My guess is that it is a mid '70s, red on the bottom, white on the top, 
&gt; without the white &quot;V&quot; on the front.
Look at the VIN number, on the front of the dash and visible from outside
the windshield.  The third digit indicates the year.  Eg. the &quot;1&quot; in 231
would mean a '71.  It's up to you to determine the decade.  :-)

&gt; 2. Does the FAQ contain info about relative value of busses? (For example, 
&gt; this bus looks fairly straight and complete, but is rumored not to have the 
&gt; engine installed.)
There is a FAQ out there covering different year busses with their pros and
cons but I don't have a copy right at hand.  Mine would probably be
outdated anyway.

&gt; 3. Should the bus be for sale, which book(s) might you recommend for repair 
&gt; work?
Bentley and/or Haynes.

&gt; 4. Any tips for approaching the owner about selling his bus and negotiating 
&gt; a price?
Just talk to them.  Even if they doesn't want to sell, you'll probably get a
nice conversation about the history of the bus, which isn't that bad a
deal, really.
