Subject: Re: Splittie with wrong size wheels


&gt;Are you sure your shocks are good/  The ride on a split is supposed to be
&gt;tight,  not sqishy like a car or a later bus.

I once had a '65 splittie with high-back '72 bug seats in the front.
What I remember about the ride was, every time I hit a bump of ANY size,
my head would slam into the roof. Is this normal for a splittie? Maybe an
indication of bad shocks?


Also, on another splitte (don't know the year on this one), it had 16&quot; (!!)
wheels. Was this standard on ANY year older bus, or did the PO get
fancy???
