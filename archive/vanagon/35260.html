Subject: Turn vanagon into Westi?

My 84 Vanagon is currently in the shop to have its head gaskets 
replaced. In the backyard is an 82 Westy wreck with a functional pop 
top (however - no seals) and some leftover Westfalia interior. The 
owner asks $100 for the pop top but warned me that the installation 
would require some major structural changes at my 84 Vanagon which he 
is not willing to make.

What structural changes is he talking about? E.g. do I need an extra 
frame up there to compensate for the missing roof? Has anybody tried 
this kind of Vanagon &quot;upgrade&quot;? If so, how difficult was it? Do you 
think a regular body shop would be able to help?  


Thanks for helping!
