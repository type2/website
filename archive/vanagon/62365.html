My experience with 14 VWs thru the years, Bugs, Buses, Rabbits, Jettas,
Etc. is that they do not use much oil, burn or leak.  Usually add between
a half and a quart in three to five thousand miles. I have been using
Synthoil in my Carat now for over 100k. I change the filter about every
5000 miles, adding a quart to cover the loss of the oil in the filter,
then change all the oil at 50,000 miles. This engine has 136k and I have
had no engine problems or water leaks. Living in southern California, I
use 15w-40 or 20w-50.
