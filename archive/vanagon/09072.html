Subject: Side Windows On PopTop

My 72 bus had windows on the side of the canvas in the pop top so I could
look out. Neat!

My 90 bus does not have these windows. It has only the window in the end.
Bummer!

So I researched and ordered today Nylon YKK Zippers from Campmor so I could
put zippers in the sides of my canvass and have side windows. 

For those who want to do this too here is the data: 

I ordered two 24&quot; zippers for the vertical axis with a Campmoor item number
of 21968. I also ordered two 64&quot; zippers for the front to back axis with a
Campmoor item number of 21972. Total cost of the items including shipping was
about $17.

Campmoor's phone number is 1-800-226-7667 but if you order, be prepared. It
is a little like JC Whitney in that you have to be willing to get catalogs
for the rest of your life (in this case, camping catalogs).

Installation of the zippers is a pain because you pretty much have to take
the roof off the van to work with the canvass. But who knows, maybe that
speedy sticher thing advertised on TV would do it without removing the
canvass for surgery.

While you are at it, you might want to order some of Campmoor's NoSeeEm
netting. You can use this netting add to the existing van nets and also to
make sure bugs won't come in the new side windows you will have cut for your
pop top.

The advantage of a side window in a pop top is also good for the summertime
as otherwise it gets too hot up there sometimes. The side windows enable good
ventilation.
