Subject: Syncro Drivers

Does anybody drive a Syncro Wesfalia up to Tahoe or other ski area regularly? 


Does Cal Trans let you through like a 4x4 truck when chains are required?

How slow are the Syncros going up up hill compared to a regular westfalia? 
Maybe it worth it to just put on chains and be able to go faster?

Thanks,
                                                                - Craig
