Subject: Re: '84 Westy Pop-Top Tent Screen Replacement

&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any experience replacing the screen on the front of the
&gt; Westy tent? It is the horizontal white plastic piece which has a zipper
&gt; which runs around the two sides and the top.  The bottom is sewn, and it
&gt; appears to be a major renovation, including removing the entire tent to
&gt; stitch a new screen into it. It is a case of patches upon patches at this
&gt; point. 
&gt; 
Mine was replaced by PO using standard vinyl mesh, and it appears it 
was done without removing the canvas. (staples appear to be 
original). The new one is sewn in, although I'm not sure if it was 
done by hand, or if there some type of portable stitching tool which 
can do this.
