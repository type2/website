Subject: 87 Vanagon: Not your ordinary leaking head
Date: Tue, 12 Mar 1996 18:22:42 -0800

Yesterday I noticed a slight smell of coolant towards the rear of my 
Vanagon. Today, I did some investigation to determine the source of the 
leak. Looking under the van I noticed several drops of coolant on the 
shroud covering the passenger-side head. I pulled the shroud and inspected 
the head gaskets. They are bone dry and clean, not cruddy. That's a good 
sign. I kept looking and determined that coolant was coming from an area on 
top of the head and just under where the #5 stud is. This is just above 
where the front exhause pipes connect and just below a coolant hose 
connection. It appears that I have a tiny crack (although I can't actually 
see it) in the head that is allowing coolant to escape.

I really hate to have to do serious head work as the van only has 70K miles 
and the gaskets are fine. What are my options (other than replacing the 
head)?
