&gt; Subject says it all basically, if anyone out there has an
&gt; air cooled parts van I need.
&gt; 
&gt; all of the right side cooling tin IE lower (case to heat exchanger),
&gt; front lower (piece from front tin down to previous piece), rear right
&gt; (around oil filler tube, under fan etc), upper right (over cylinders),
&gt; and most importantly rear upper right (under alternator, connects
&gt; rear right to upper right).  I also need the 2 left lower pieces, I
&gt; first mentioned on the right side).  Local bug guy promised me these
&gt; for $25 but I've been waiting 3 weeks for him to get a set off.
&gt; 
&gt; Could also use a brown (or I guess if price was right black) steering
&gt; column/ignition switch cover.
