Subject: Re: performance tires

I just went to the 205X65 R15 Conti reinforced sidewall on Borbett II
15X7 rims.  The van handles much better and rides like a dream!  Best
investment I have made in my van.  I looked at going the 16&quot; route but
decided that a 16X8 rim may cause clearance problems with the width. 
Cool looking wheels for sure!
