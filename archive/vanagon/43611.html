Subject: Re: help on 65 

And still more problems on my Girlfriends 65.  I don't know much about
these older busses; hers is a 23(21?) window, with a sunroof, real nice.
It has, I think, a 73 superbeetle engine.  Maybe a 74.  Nevertheless.

1.  Generator's toast.  Tried to get it out but have this problem.  The
idiot's guide and bentley manual say raise the fan shroud.  Ok, but one of
the screws I'm supposed to unscrew is behind the manifold (left side) :-|.
So alright, whatever, I don't think it'll matter anyway because I got the
RHS off and I raise the shroud as high as it will go and I'm not getting
that fan out!  I tried to take off the oil filler/generator support, but I
can't even get the generator high enough for the support to clear its
bolts!  (And to get it it's front (FIF) nut off I had to take of the fuel
pump, whose front nut necessitated removal of the distributor (the knee
bone's connected to the ....).

my ex boyfriend would drop the motor to change the generator.   If you have a
doghouse cooler you do have to pull the motor.  also if the thermostat is
hooked up.    I've done it with it in the bus, with a standard oil cooler, no
thermostat.      you DO need to get both side screw/nuts out.       i leave
out that bottom screw on the left of the four holding the generator tin onto
the fanhousing tin.


2.  Was changing the front tire.  The place where you stick the jack is
rusty as hell.  I didn't know how rusty until Anne stepped into the bus,
and a god-awful crunch emanated from that area, all kinds of rust chips
flew everywhere, and the bus bent in that area.  Any way to fix this rust
in a hurry?

no-   from now on use a floor jack on a solid frame member.    think about
the rust and fixing it all (and new window seals)    21 windows are usually
rusty.   look at rockers, inner and outer, jack points, outriggers, sub
floor, front floor under the mat where the windsheild leak and rust it,
behind the wheel wells, battery tray.   dont despair.   a know a guy who did
a great job on a really rusty 59 23 window  in a couple weeks.    im waiting
to see it at the shows..  or ignore the rust....
