Subject: Zemco Cruise Control, out of business?


Hello all,

I got an offer from

Zemco Import
K. Spielberger GmbH
Huber-Jakl-Weg 8
D-83395 Freilassing
Germany

about cruise controls and others. The cruise control
includes following items:

AP 150  Basic box 'vacuum' with ABE
AP 250  Basic box 'electric' with ABE
CM 1    Control
CM 2    Control
CM 3    Control
CSI-2   Interface for original controls
AA 170  Switch for clutch pedal
AA 147  Pick up for speedo cable

Are there same items available in US? What prices?
I read, that Zemco would be out of business. This
can't be true.
