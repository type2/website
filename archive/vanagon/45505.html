Subject: RE: 84 Vanagon Westy - Fuel Pump Noise

Jim Felix rubs it in that he has a watercooled Vgon, rather than aircooled --
he can hear his fuel pump.  Only way I can picture making it quieter is
to check that the little rubber standoffs that hold it away from the 
chassis are present, and that it doesn't touch any metal.
