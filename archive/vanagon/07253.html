I've Never had any problems crossing the border in cars other than VW Vans.
In the, owned by my dad, 71 bus that I grew up road tripping in, we were 
hassled a few times.  And now when I cross in my 85 I am hassled more
often than not.
Then again I am a young, un-shaven, punk... but I never get hassled in 
other cars, even with all other factors unchanged.
