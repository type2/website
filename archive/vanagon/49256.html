So Turner,Ronald L. says:
&gt; Some Idiot is using the list for their perverse personal gain ( or prank) re-
&gt; the most recent post &quot;Male escort&quot; garbage.  Everybody should e-mail them and
&gt; advise them to peddle their nonsense elsewhere!!!

Actually, as most people reading the internet or mailing lists figure out
after reading for a while, is that it's best just to ignore these kinds
of annoying posts and in most cases, they just stop posting.  After all,
there's no way to know if this is a legitimate post or someone else 
using the aforementioned persons account to pull a sick.  

Stay cool.....
