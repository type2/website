Replying to Tom F.'s comment on Coleman Catalytics...I have an older upright
Propane powered coleman catalytic that runs on 16.4oz cannisters and works
fairly well.  It's portable, green, uses readily available fuels, doesn't 
flare badly and has three heat settings.  These little critters were produced
in the 60s and 70s and are NLA from Coleman.  However they work really well,
have a thermosensing shutoff and can be purchased used for ~35US$.  They
are not the round white gas powered catalytics and are not the round reflector
type commonly available now.  They are 12x16x8 free standing upright and
have a heating element similar to the Olympian series of LPG RV heaters.

Best of all they're portable and occupy no permanent storage and of course
they're inexpensive.
