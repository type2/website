Subject: Re: oil burning on new engine

&gt;
&gt;But in all honesty it seems a step backwards.  The only Diesel engines with
&gt;which I have any familiarity are Cumins, which have a very low oil
&gt;consumption and regularly achieve service lives of half a million miles or
&gt;more.
        Ok, who's gonna run out and put a Cummins in their bus? Steve? Anyone??

;-) ;-) ;-)

Peace,
