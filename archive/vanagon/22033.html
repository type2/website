  Welcome to the Bay Area!

  I have the same recommendations for parts sources that Erik Soule gave.
  As to shops, several listmembers have recommeded Fred's Garage in Redwood
  City for quality repairs on VWs.

  I look forward to meeting you at a subsequent BABA  &lt;Bay Area Bus Addicts?
  a term coined by Joel, I think&gt; function or campout.


  Dave
