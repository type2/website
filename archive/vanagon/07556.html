Subject: Waterproof window sealant?

About a month ago, someone posted about a product by 3m which was some 
kind of sealant goop you could put around/in/under your window &quot;seals&quot; to 
keep the rain out. Anybody heard of this stuff or something similar? I've 
had my windshields replaced as well as the seals, but they still leak 
rain water onto my stereo. Help!!
