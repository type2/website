Miz Louise -

ANSWER #1
A Fan.  No, really, those neat little add-on top dashboard fans do stir
the air around, they don't pull that much current and it's even more
helpful when you slightly crack open the windows, just enough so that the
torrential downpour doesn't fill the van up.  I also crack open the rear
hatch door a little bit too for as much flow-thru as possible.  Works for
me, but may not work for you, YMMV.

ANSWER #2
Gee, these would be nice.  But after 4 years of keeping track of the
costs of making Safari Windows from &quot;you-know-where&quot;, it wouldn't be
cheap to do.  I think Reimo in Europe offers these (I could be wrong),
but then they're not cheap there either.

ANSWER #3
3 Window Poptop Canvases are available, even for the Vanagon Westy.
Price is about $280 I believe.  I only have the 1 Window on mine and it
is in such perfect condition, I haven't given it much thought about
retro-fitting yet.

&gt;Greetings VolksFolks..........
&gt;
&gt;While sitting inside a very stuffy vanagon during a torrential
&gt;downpour at
&gt;O'Leno State Park Campout this past weekend, we were trying to
&gt;determine
&gt;how to improve, increase, or modify ANYTHING to get some ventilation.
&gt;
&gt;Question #1:
&gt;I would be *very* interested to hear what ingenuity the &quot;Royal&quot; and
&gt;&quot;Collective&quot; &quot;We&quot; has invented in that regard.....
&gt;
&gt;and .....
&gt;
&gt;Question #2:
&gt;Dave Easterwood and I were discussing the possibility of manufacturing
&gt;custom jalousied windows for vanagons. Would any of you be interested?
&gt;
&gt;and....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Question #3:
&gt;Has anyone retrofitted the top canvas to reinstate the side triangular
&gt;windows as are in my 72?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;
