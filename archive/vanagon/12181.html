I've got a certain problem with one of my diesel Vanagons, that really has me
baffled.  It has to be a grounding problem OR a stabilizer (if my Van has such
a monster)

When the headlites are off, no power or very little power being drawn by the 
electrical system,,,the heat temp gauge runs a bit high.  It will
show a bit on the warm side.

BUT------turn the headlites on and the temp gauge returns to its normal off 
center position.

Well........suggestions?  (Yeah I heard the remark of running with lites on 
all the time....which I do mostly anyway)
