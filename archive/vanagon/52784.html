Subject: Re: How do you FEEL about tires?

We live in deep snow country, just west of Ottawa, Canada.

Comparing Y370 LT 195/75R14 light truck tires and Nokia Hakkapalita deep
snow tires:

&gt;From 1980 to 1995, we drove our Saab 99 on 165R15 Hakkas snow tires. At
first we had Nr 08's then Nr 09's (never tried their 10's). These are
the best snows available anywhere.
If I could get these for the Westy, I would. Note that Nr 08's and 09's
are no longer available and the newer designs are not as good IMHO.

This year we're driving on Y370's on our '86 syncro. These tires are
good, very good but they are not snows. The rubber is harder; they do
not throw the snow as easily; they do not grip ice as well (the sipping
doesn't grip as well when cold). The tread pattern on the side of the
foot print is not as sharp; as a result, the tire can slip sideways more
easily; grip in a turn through snow is not as controlled. The Y370's are
better on any road surface except snow and/or ice.

So far we've towed a car uphill through 6 inches of snow. Not a real
test but encouraging enough for me to stick with them through this
winter.

&gt; Have read so much data about the Yokos, etc, What I really want to know
&gt; is why people like the tires they've got. Thanks...... Rob
