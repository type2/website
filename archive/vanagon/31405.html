Subject: Camper water &amp; power ports

When my 81 Westy emerges from the shop, the three water and 110 volt power
ports will need to be replaced. I believe it was &quot;Bus Boys&quot; that quoted me
about $50 each. They are the only source that I've run across in my limited
search but that does seem like a lot of $.
 Is that reasonable, or is there another source? 
Thanks for you help.  Weston
