I always thot the air had something to do with it.  All that blowing around
in there.  You see them spinner-things on the hills making the electric outta
air.  Veedubs gots air, you can feel it if you takes your shoes off and stand
behind one.  Feels real good in the winter, all that hot air blowing on your
toes.  

I think hot air has a lot to do with it.
