Subject: 3.2L Carerra Engine Conversion

I have searched the archives and still have a few questions about the
conversion I am about to undertake.  I am planning to install a 1989
3.2L Carerra engine in my 86 GL Syncro.  I was planning to use the
Martin Schneider conversion kit.  Has anyone on the list done this
conversion.  What hidden traps await me?
