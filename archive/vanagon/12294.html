Subject: Re: driving my bus to and in B.C.

Any tire chains will fit the rear axle of the bus, wheel wells are huge 
unless you have extra wide tires. Good snowwies, Yokohamas sound fine, will 
do wonders, chains are for &lt;50 kph and desperate driving. Chains are 
expensive and nerve-wracking. I only use mine to get out of deep snow on top 
of ice, at which they are unbeatable. Take them off asap. They are a good 
way to freeze your hands fitting them on too! If you do opt for a set make 
sure they have a very good way of keeping the chains tight, usually a heavy 
bungee cord attached all over the place to the links. NO loose pieces! They 
can beat the paint off your van fast, and cause a lot of damage if they come 
off at speed! A set of chains will cost you what one good tire does anyhow, 
save up for the second tire!   tim s.
