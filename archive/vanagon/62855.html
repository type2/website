Subject: running rough, part II

Thanks to those who responded with some suggestions for my van which 
began sputtering this morning.

This is what happened this afternoon:

I parked it this morning (as I wasn't going much further) and went back 
later ready to check the fuel pump, and temperature sensor.  (I wasn't 
too sure if I had the car knowledge to check these but I was going to 
try).  Anyhow, I decided to drive it somewhere convient to check these 
and it drove fine.

Why would it be aweful this morning (around 9) and great this afternoon 
(around 2)?

Thanks a load,

Blake
