Subject:       Re: Subaru 2.2 in Vanagon?

&gt; &gt;Kennedy Engineered products has a &quot;KIT&quot; for the transplant. you DO have to
&gt; &gt;have a complete subaru engine, wiring harness, and a LOT of other parts. It
&gt; &gt;WOULD be the same cost to do your engine over...that said the Suby has 135
&gt; &gt;HP, the parts cost less, and it is fuel injected also.I assume the 150 HP
&gt; &gt;newest model will mount the same, so here is where to contact them.

There is, as stated above, a new 2.5l 150HP they are putting only in 
the Auto transmission Outback Edition.  Supposedly the same engine 
made bigger.

It would probably be quite hard to come by one of the new 2.5's 
(since it was introduced in the '96 model year), but if there was a 
rolled Outback that one could get it out of...
