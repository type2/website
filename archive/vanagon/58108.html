Subject: Kelley Park Show - A Nice Show &amp; A Real Nice Find

Kelley Park show today was rather nice, packed with cars and people.  Went
there not to sell (didn't have time to put together anything, what with the
new Website changeover and all), but just to look around, buy a few things,
etc.

For those who don't know, I purchased an 84 Westy Automatic last year with a
slightly ventilated case on the top.  Finally pulled the beast and when
pulling off the right cyl head, what to my surprise (and the machinist
helping me) the #2 piston was toally gone - nada - zip - not there.  Just a
pin frozen to an &quot;S&quot; shaped connecting rod (contrary to popular belief, it's
not a racing rod..;)...)  Didn't look good.  Proceeded to split what was left
of the case and found that it looked like someone grenaded the insides.  Only
thing salvageable was the oil pump (looks like new), the distributor
driveshaft and amazingly enough the crankshaft - may not even need turning.
 Three rods are good for re-conning (or for exchange from AVP).  Camshaft (-1
Gear) is in three pieces with very little wear on the lobes FWIW.  Note -
engine has 82K on it.  Looks like the dreaded PO over-revved this poor 1.9.
 Heads are decent, but have tiny cracks between the seats - mulling over what
to do next about heads.  Even at my cost new ones are deadly priced (over
$350 ea - yep and that's direct from the guy who brings 'em in I don't get
much more from customers for 'em).

So here I am at Kelley Park, looking around, buying a little of this and a
little of that for Bus Boys, and lo and behold, some guy has a 2.1 engine,
sans waterpump/thermo housing and sans heads - out of an automatic no less -
Engine #MV005141 with a * at the end of the number (factory rebuilt?).
 Friend needed the heads, so no go there.  Asking $75.00.  Still had the
pistons and barrels on - turns over real nice, no stiffness or lockup.  Lot
of other spare parts (FI, exhaust, etc) for the engine too.  Take it all he
says.  Not wanting to jinx this, it was quickly packed away for transport
back home.  Gonna pull it apart tomorrow.  If OK, purchasing a set of 2.1
heads (new or rebuilt) will be a little easier on my mind.  It would be nice
to have a 2.1 in the Westy and hopefully, this would be worth the wait.  Nice
ending for a birthday weekend too.

One question tho - Can anyone who has the knowledge tell me what the H E
doubletoothpick are the differences between the 1.9 and 2.1 heads?  They have
the same valves, rockers and look alike to me and if the 1.9's are
salvageable I'd like to use them.  If not, oh-well.

BTW - I bought the Westy for 1000 smackers and it is in otherwise MINT
condition.
