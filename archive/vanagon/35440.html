Mark J and Eddie H. were freakin about VWTV shows...

BUSES ON TV!

Last night I was at a friends house and his roommate got a call about the
cable channel show called &quot;Wild About Wheels.&quot;
 I have seen the program before but they ususally concentrate misc big block
GM BS or Trains or sumpin.  The phone caller mentioned that he just watched
an episode related to the history of VW buses starting with Barndoors and
moved on up to the present. Promised were scenes of sunroof buses by the
train carloads. Of course the phone caller didn't have a VCR and we didnt
have the cable at the friends house.
I am hoping that the show repeats itself during the weekend. The show is the
typical Saturday afternoon programming (opposite the bowling leagues and the
all so exciting golf matches both narrated in whispered tones while the kids
scream in the background over unshared toys).  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! It
usually come on around the time the &quot;Inbred Rednecked Trucks USA&quot; and Drag
racing from some &quot;Egypt&quot; location.
