&gt;Also, it came with a Yakima bike rack that has the support braces resting

&gt;experience with this type of rack? (It has straps that hang from the hatch,
&gt;and bottom braces that rest on the bottom of the hatch.) Mostly there will
&gt;just be my bike, but there may occasionally be two.

I've used this type of rack extensively with my Golf.  No problems with two
bikes.  It *looks* dangerous, but it seems to work.
