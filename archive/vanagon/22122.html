Subject: Grease recommendations

Hi all,
I reassembled my shift linkage and used standard wheel bearing grease to 
lube the shaft, etc.  VW recommends a specific kind of grease and I'm 
wondering if this is nothing more than moly CV joint lube.  Or if white 
lithium grease will work just as well (and not be near as messy)?

Thanks in advance for any comments.

Jack
