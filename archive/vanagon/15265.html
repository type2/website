Subject: RE: VW-'71 BUS and '80? BUS-INTERSPECIES TRANSPLANTS OF EQUIPMENT

Nick Pace has a 78 or so (my guess) bus as a temporary lawn ornament.  To
my miserly mind, the pieces that you do not pull off the junker are those
that (1) don't fit in, on or near the garage; (2) are needed to let the
landlord tow the car; or (3) don't come off.  Note that I have not offered
any criteria that have to do with fitting on your 71.  You think your 71
will be the last bus you ever?  You think you don't have at least 10 
friends on this list alone within 2 hours drive?  Gut that sucker.  Don't
forget the glass.  Pull the engine; it's good practice and worst case
someone can use it for a core.

I admire, and emulate your approach to parts replacement.  If I need a
widget, I don't care what it came off -- most especially if using it
saves me $40 and a trip to the parts place.
