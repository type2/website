Subject: Camp grounds and sights

I am headed toward Niagra Falls for the week of the 4th.  Are there any
suggested sights to see between Nashville TN and Toronto Canada?  
Can anyone tell me if there would be a problem crossing the border into
Canada with a dog. 
And what type of ID is required to crossover and back again?
