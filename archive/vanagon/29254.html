Nothing to do with the distributor ???????

If what you say is true, then I can adjust #1 and #3 valves at the same 
time: when the TDC mark on the pulley is lined up with the crankcase.

Is this true? Remember that the crankshaft rotates twice for all 
cylinders to fire...

Your comments about the CDI make sense if it's a point-switched unit: Oh, 
well, it was a nice try....

&gt; Valves are adjusted relative to position of the TDC mark on the pulley --
&gt; nothing to do with the distributor.  And a CDI unit will still utilize the
&gt; advance characteristics of the distributor.  If you have a new CDI and a 
&gt; bad distributor you'll have a nice strong spark, timed wrong.
