Subject:       mounting bracket for t1 into t2

I hope I'm not boring the veterans here but I need help/advice so I can get my 
bus on the road.  

Scenario:
I have three engines (two in the bus, one in the living room) built on cases 
from '67-'67 T1's.  All three cases are different in regards to the pseudo mounting 
bosses for the support beam on the rear of the engine.  I mounted one of the 
oil pump mounting brackets on one ('68) and there was nothing in the way of the 
mounting bolts on the engine side of the bracket.  We'll I got a bigger engine 
(on a '67 case) and decided to mount the bracket on it.  Well, looking at the 
back of the engine, there is a tapped hole, almost flush with the bracket, 
right behind the top right mount.  There is a solid part of the case right 
behind the bottom hole on the bracket, this one with a slight indentation 
lining up perfectly with the hole on the bracket.  Looks like this is some kind 
of universal case, right?  But there is nothing behind the top left mounting hole.  
I'm confused at this point.  So, I go inside and the other '68 engine has all 
three lobes.  Top right is tapped, bottom on has a smaller hole (tapped?) and top
left just has slight indentation.  What gives? 
Well, after all that, my request for advice.  I would like to put the 1641 in 
the bus.  What should I do? 
Possible options:

1.  Grind the case down enough to get a bolt between the bracket and the case 
and use the mounting bracket.

2.  Scrap bracket, drill and tap the bottom boss and just use the two mounting 
holes on the case.  Probably not a good idea,  obviously it was engineered for 
three mounting places.

3.  Leave bracket on, drill and tap bottom boss,  find a longer bolt for the 
top right, and a spacer (there's about 2mm of space beween the bracket and the 
case.  bolt throught the bracket  into the case on the top right and bottom and 
the normal mounting nut and bolt for the top left.  I thought about using some all-thread 
into the top right and bottom  and use nuts on the rear side of the mounting beam.

This is a plea for help and or advice.  I want to drive my bus!

Thanks,
Mike
