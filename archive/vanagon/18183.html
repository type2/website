Subject: RE: Serie -vs- Parallel

While I agree with you in principal Bob, I only disagree with your use of the
terms series and parallel.  Nearly all batteries are constructed of cells
connected in SERIES, your 12V battery has 6 - 2V cells in series and there is no
internal current flowing in the battery due to mismatches in the individual cell
potentials.  A 6V battery has 3 -2V cells in series, so connecting two 6V
batteries in series makes a 12V battere (i.e. 6 - 2V cells in series).

ANY two power sources connected in PARALLEL have the potential for circulating
current between that is wasted (i.e. not dissipated in the load).  In fact, if I
remember correctly, one of the Electrician Mate's job on our submarine was to
check that the potential between parallel connected cells in the series-parallel
connected 250V batteries was closely matched, in order to preserve battery life.
 The batteries were charged by connecting them in parallel to another DC source
that was at a higher voltage, thus causing current to flow between the two DC
sources, charging the batteries.  When we paralleled the turbine generators, one
of the things that we had to do was make sure the voltages were well matched, to
avoid creating circulating currents, which in an AC circuit like the turbine
generators, causes a poor power factor, which reduces efficiency and heats the
generator windings.  We also didn't normally operate any two sources in parallel
except when transferring power from one source to the other for reconfiguring
the power distribution (such as when the reactor was down and we surfaced to
operate the diesel generator to take the load off the batteries), or to charge
the batteries.

I guess what this means is that I agree that current will flow between connected
power sources, but it is only when they are in parallel, not in series.

&gt;           B's positive to A's negative, A's positive to vehicle's positive
&gt;           terminal.  Doubles the voltage (6V+6V--&gt; 12V, 
&gt;           12V+12V--&gt;24V), halves the CCA, assuming A and B identical.

But, I think that series connected batteries are limited only by the current
capacity of the weakest link in the chain, so the CCA of series connected
batteries wouldn't be halved, but would be equal to the CCA of the lowest rated
battery in the chain.  This is because the same current flows through both
batteries, so the only limit is how much can flow through any one, before the
voltage drops below spec.
