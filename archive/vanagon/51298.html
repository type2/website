Subject: Diesel Westy Glow Plug LED

The glow plug light on my '82 Diesel Westy (35K) comes on to show that it works
but quickly goes out no matter what temperature the engine is at.  Is there a
temperature sensor which tells the LED to go out??

We haven't heard anything out here in the west coast about the election. 
What's happening with the exit polls?
