&gt; Subject: Re: list sticker
&gt; Evan, I just sent a request to Joel Re: the sticker...he replied that they
&gt; were produced by Richard Palmer. Maybe if we get an order together he may be
&gt; interested in making some more????????????Hint hint.
&gt;
While I would love to print more stickers, there is a problem- to get any
decent price on them, I have to order at least 500 stickers. That's a LOT of
stickers to sell, considering a lot of folks already have them. If both lists
would agree to have a universal sticker with both addresses, (We're still the
same big, happy family, right??), that would make it easier. Last time I sold
them in packs of 3 and 7. That means that about 150 people would have to order
stickers.
Just to try to sucker...er, entice some of the folks who already have stickers,
perhaps I could make these a different reflective color, so they would still be
eye-catching, yet slightly different.
  Then here's the other problem. the last batch of t-shirts I did, about 30
people e-mailed that they would buy one. However, when the orders came in, I
only sold 15, which didn't even cover my costs. I would hate to get stuck with
a box of stickers that I really can't afford.
Anyway, I am not altogether opposed to the idea, just a bit wary this time...
If enough people promise, swear, etc, that they will actually buy stickers, not
lie to me and get my hopes up, I might think about it. As in, this time, if I
receive e-mail from you, I will keep it, and keep replying to you until I get
your order. (You can't escape!!!)
  So, go ahead, try to convince me...(I will trade stickers for pop-tops, or
crew cabs!)
