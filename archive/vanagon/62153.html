Vanagoners:

	I'm putting the Vanagon on the market because I'm using it almost
exclusively as my daily (back and forth to work) driver. I'm unlikely to
put it to use as a camper anytime soon again. 
	The details:
		WV2YB0257MH002570
		1991 Carat   Orly Blue
		108,000 miles; 9,000 miles on new engine (VW factory rebuild by Pete
Moore Imports, Pensacola, FL)
		all new cooling system hoses at time of engine replacement (June 1996)
		new a/c compressor in 1996, a/c working well
		all Carat extras, even the snap on curtains

	Email or call (334-304-0565) for questions.
