Subject: RE: A NAME FOR VANAGON FANATICS!

And it was written...

&gt; VANATICS! 
&gt; ...
&gt; VW is the only company that makes Vanagons, of course.
&gt; But it isn't the only one that makes vans. The name might apply
&gt; to Chevy vans, Ford vans... Hmmmm...
&gt; 
&gt; Vanagonatics? Kinda long.
&gt; Vanagatics? Nope.
&gt; Busnatics? A stretch.
&gt; Vanageeks? No thanks.
&gt; StreamlinedAsABrick? REAL long.
&gt; 

Well, before my Obsession phase I was just a guy who owned a bus - I only 
obsessed about stuff like what type of billet they were using to mill the cranks 
for my mountain bike. Now I've only owned it for a week-an-a-half, but already I 
considered myself a *Syncronaut* :)
