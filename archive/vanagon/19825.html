Subject: Hey, this person needs some flannel help! (F)

&gt; &gt; Just wanted to bop in and say halloo to the news gruop as I am new here.
&gt; &gt; I am a student at the U of Alaska Polar Bear campus 
&gt; welcome frosty one!
&gt; question is, can you make exciting underwear out of flannel?

	In order to have exciting flannel underwear, one must only point 
out to the viewer that flannel keeps whatever it covers pretty hot.  At 
this point in time, the viewer will begin to foam at the mouth and wish 
to spank someone....Me, please! should I have flannel underwear? I haven't 
decided on the material or color yet! (yes, that is an opening for lewd 
remarks about nakedness)
