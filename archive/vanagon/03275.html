&gt;wouldn't that be a helluva note to enter a 1950 bus and 1950 beetle!  :)


Hey, I'm game if you are!  I have a bunch of &quot;period&quot; rally equipment
pieces that I have been hoarding for the 1956...

A Halda Twinmaster complete with all the drive cables and the &quot;T&quot;
piece, a Heuer dash mounted 8-day clock and a Heuer dash mounted
split stopwatch which reads in both seconds and hundredths/minutes...

Got a couple of books from that UK author Peter Noad about modifying
a beetle for rallying...and Beetles in motorsports...

My wife and I rallied the '56 last year and took first in class...
we had our &quot;computer&quot; hooked up to a 12 v battery...

So...I'm ready!


Lets do it!!!
