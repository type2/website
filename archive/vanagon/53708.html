Subject: Re:  Rocker Mouldings

HI there,

I have a navy blue 86 Vanagon and I'm looking for the &quot;Rocker Mouldings&quot; which
fit on the sides to protect the vehicle from parking lot nicks, etc.  If anyone
can help me locate a set of these, please contact me.  I think they would need
to be blue, although  maybe I could change the color if they did'nt match my
navy color.

Thanks,

Charles
