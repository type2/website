&gt;I've been having a gas smell appear in my bus lately. Where do these 
&gt;recovery tubes hook up to the gas tank?
&gt;
&gt;

The top of the tank!  The cover plate that you see from looking at the engine
has to be removed.  this wil require removing the carbs and everything else
from the top of the engine.  Sometimes the hoses that connect the tubes to
the tank do fail. Some people cut access holes through the deck above the
tank.  This is often easisest way to replce the gauge sender.  If you suspect
gas being where it shouldn't be,  be real careful cutting anything.
 Remember. it's the fumes. not the liquid that burns.  Be Careful!
