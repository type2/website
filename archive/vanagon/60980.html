Malcom:
I beg to differ. I have a dash mounted LED (O2 sensor) monitor. I have
NEVER seen the system go into open loop once it reaches operating
temperature. In fact the higher the RPMs the faster the lean/rich cycles
occur.

&gt;You see, the system goes into an open-loop mode. bypassing the sensor 
&gt;at  something like 3000 rpm and above. Then engines make so little power

&gt;at altitude that you usually downshift and keep the rev's high.  The 
&gt;airflow meter, which kinda measures air mass, kinda compensates.  I
understand 
&gt;the hot-wire versions do a better job.
&gt;
&gt;In closed-loop operation (normal driving) the O2 sensor will do a good 
&gt;job of controlling for optimum burn, including compensating for
altitude.
