Using the 12 volt and gas at the same time will eventually desteroy the
ammonia system of the fridge from overheating it.  It is a complicated
process but there are chemical reactions that have to be at the proper temps
to operate.  If the chemicals separate, rust and scale can form inside the
system eventualy blocking passages.  Running the fridge unlevel will do the
same damage.
