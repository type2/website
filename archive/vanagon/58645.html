Subject: Re: Running syncro w/o driveshaft?

Thank you &quot;Jim Davis&quot; for a clear, concise, venom-free description of the
workings of a VC and syncro system.

I had been feeling the need to install a middle seat in my van just so I
could hide under it, but I was too scared to look under the carpet.  :)
Apologies to all, or some, for posting a brain dead hypothesis, based on
ignorance and lack of a manual. I must have been laboring under the
misconception that this was a discussion forum.  

In the mean time I am working on developing the character traits required to
post hypotheses to the list, with the  air of authority .
