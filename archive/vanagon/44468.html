Subject: Re: sway-bars: why not street legal in CA?

&gt; This week's question: I picked up my new rear EMPI sway bar for the bus and
&gt; noticed the warning about using it in California. Apparently, &quot;those in
&gt; charge&quot; have reason to believe that they may be dangerous. Why? 


  This seems to be the disclaimer on everything that EMPI sells.

  If you order a service manual from them it comes with the same 
sticker.  Empi does not want to be held responseable for anything that 
might happen when using their products.

  This is not to say that Empi sells anything that is not safe, but to 
make sure they cover their ASSES.
