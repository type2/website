&gt; 5 cylinder Vanagon jeesh....
etc.

Are we wondering whether the 5 cyl. Audi motor will fit in a Vanagon? 
Well, I don't know, but Mike Luxton at Transporters (UK) told me that the
Vanagon is now built and sold in South Africa with the 5 cyl Audi engine. 
It's my guess that a bolt-in swap could be done if one could obtain the
right South African parts. (?)
