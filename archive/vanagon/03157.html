&gt;     74 Bus    5    

Joel,
This here's good ol' Ralferoonie up in Canada and after checking
my VIN again I realize that the Beast is actually a Kombi.  It
remains a '74 however...  Btw, something that I didn't realize 
before:  The Kombis are shorter!  By, uh, 20cms. or something.
If you look at the back of the Haynes and check the dimensions
you'll see it.  I'd state the exact amount but left the book at
the farm...  Danke.
