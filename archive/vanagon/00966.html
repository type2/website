&gt;One thing I like about the four-lever
&gt;system is its simplicity... top lever for air delivery to the windshield,
&gt;next lever down for temp, next lever for footwell air deliver, and the
&gt;bottom lever for the rear fresh air.
&gt;
&gt;Kudos to the VW engineers!

I must admit that I had a tough time remembering the function of each lever
until the visual correlation of top-to-bottom = front-to-back introduced
itself to me.  Now I agree that it is easy to use.
