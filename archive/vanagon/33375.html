Subject: Help, Advice needed on electrical.

First let me take a moment to thank Joe Fournier and Pat Walsh and the rest 
of you who took the time to send me the electrical diagrams for the ignition 
switch
on my '71 Bus. They helped to confirm my wiring was correct. 

I still can't figure out why when the starter is engaged the juice to the
coil goes out...only to return the moment I release the key and the starter 
stops. Is this the norm? I don't think so.

Would somebody PLEASE check the black wire off the ignition and see if it is 
hot when you engage the starter.  I also noticed that all but two of the 
fuses go dead when you turn on the starter...the other two seem to be always 
on.  

I'm thinking that perhaps the way to go on this is tap into the consistant juice
at the fuse box and install a switch between the consistant juice and the coil
wire that would solve my problem and would provide me with a kill switch to help
deter a ametuer theif.

I need help...Martin
