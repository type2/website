Subject: Identifying a vacuum source??

I'm trying to figure out what a particular vacuum part controls.  Does
anyone know??

*  Directly behind the air cleaner lies a round plastic component with a
hose attached to the top that bends at about a 45 degree angle (about 2
inches) the hose then runs to a to another piece located near the throttle.


What is this vacuum piece, what does it control and what goes out of kilter
when it is disconnected?

Regrads,
