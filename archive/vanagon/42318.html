Subject: &quot;Mint&quot; 85 Westy FS (Phoenix)

'85 Westy Camper  -95k on odo- Cosmetically near mint condition, loaded, all
Westy items, A/C, Stereo. Well maintained. Adult son is selling as part of
his father's estate. Has been extremely well maintained. Spent summers in
Illinois and winters in Arizona. &quot;Dad&quot; covered up factory carpet with indoor
out door upon delivery and removed extra jump seat. Therefore the carpets
and jump seat are perfect. Paint is described as a dark metalic beige with
lighter brown/tannish poptop. Sounds like Dad was a maintenece freak.
Currently stored indoors. No evidence of head leaks etc. Driven occasionally
and maintained regularly. Front table and jump seat are in Illinois and will
be shipped to the new owner as part of the deal.
Asking $10,750.00 obo

Call &quot;Randy&quot; at  (602) 829-8031 

Usual disclaimers. Ellis has not seen the vehicle. Tell Randy that the guy
from the internet said to call. I am not a part of this deal in any manner.
Just sounded like a nice one for the wanna-bees!
