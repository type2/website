Nahh.

I may be among the fortunate few, but my 2 Busses, far
from nickel &amp; diming me to death, are very reliable, get
little beyond routine maintenance, and have never (knock 
wood, real loud) broken down on the road--they've always
had the good sense to develop problems very near to home.
(These Busses are used/abused daily, or, in the case of
the '68, several times a week).

IMHO, you may have fewer problems with a good, solid air-
cooled than with a wasserboxer.  (This is based on nothing
more than my own observations, mind you.)

Do it.
