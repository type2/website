Dano

Sometime within the last 2 months, someone wrote in and mentioned that they
took the failed u-joint to a standard u-joint shop and they matched it up to a
standard, available, off the shelf u-joint .

&lt;snip&gt;
I removed the driveshaft yesterday, and found one u joint that was seized
along 1 axis.  It would only move about 20 degrees either way.  No wonder the
thing shook!!  I hope the trans case wasn't damaged, as it is wet near the
output flange.

Does anyone know about those u joints?  Can they be replaced?
