So Sideshow Bob says:
&gt; 
&gt; bunch o'questions:  

Speaking of questions.  Are you really Kelsey Grammer? ;)

&gt; first, my' 73 keeps eating clutch cables.  it picks a
&gt; different way every time though.  once it snapped near the clutch lever.
&gt; once it snapped at the front.  yesterday th metal thing you shove the pin
&gt; through shattered. why? why? why?  this is getting to be a pain in the
&gt; _at_#$.  [i do have the change time down to under five minutes though]

I went through this nonsense with my '68 bug for a while.  Make sure
you get a new hook/pedal thingy and not a used one.  Lubricate the hook
and cable loop so there's less friction.  Make sure the cable has clear 
of obstructions from front to rear.  As far as cable integrity is concerned,
I have no idea how to tell good from bad.  

&gt; next: joel tells me _not_ to static time my bus.  muir says _only_ static
&gt; time it.  now joel isn't muir, but he seems to know what he's talking
&gt; about most of the time.  what should i do?  i understand how to static
&gt; time my car; should it be done?

Now who ya gonna believe?  A guy who's sold millions of copies of a fine
book that describes the air-cooled maintenance to the finest detail to
the point of genius or some backwoods, grit between-his-teeth watercooled
driving goober in B.F. Alabama?  

Thought so, I'd go with the goober too. ;)

Anyway, my experience has been that the static timing performance has been
close enough providing you pay attention to performance, the color of
your spark plugs and the heat of your engine.

However if you have access to a timing light with distributor advance
feature, it gives you exactly the advance curve your beast requires.
Remember, the Muir explanation was written in the spirit of saving the
poor VW scrounge money and was in the good enough realm.  I'm sure 
Muir wouldn't have argued with using the best most accurate method
available.

&gt; yep, there's more: she's pulling to the right a lot these days. how does
&gt; one fix that? i'm sick of driving off the road everytime i try to shift
&gt; and smoke my cigarette at the same time. [quitting smoking isn't the
&gt; remedy i'm looking for]

Sounds like you need a wheel alignment/tire balance.  Hope your tires aren't
to worn too much from driving it too long this way.  Because if you have then
an alignment may not help you till your next set of tires.

&gt; rear latch: its locken, closed, broken, and i cannot get it open. 

So much for setting the timing. ;)  I really don't know how I'd approach
this one.  I'll let someone else who might have an idea about it
answer that one.

Cheers!
