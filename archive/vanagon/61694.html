Subject: Re: Eurovan Winnibago VR6 at June Jitter Bug Show

My local VW dealer (Southern California) has had VR6 Eurobagos since
early spring. They have a slightly more rounded nose than my 1995 5
cylinder, airbags, modified sliding door hardware, and only come with
the 4 speed automatic. Other than seat fabric material and  a pair of
reading lights over the rear seat, the interior is identical to my 1995.

&gt;Very interesting.  It apparently is not available yet, but it certainly was there in the flesh
