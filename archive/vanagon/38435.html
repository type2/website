Subject: Re: Sunroof Question: Part II

Never say never. Just about everything was an option and even combinations
that are supposed to be impossible managed to sneak out of the factory.

yes- that's who i put that qualifyer in there.  But why would someone want
that?

BTW, while we're talking about wierd combinations, did you see the picture
of a '63 bus with a sliding door in V*lksw*rld a while ago. At least I think
it was a '63, it was definitely earlier than '67 when these were supposed to
be first available.

sliding doors were available as an option in 63.  I have seen a picture of a
deluxe w/ sunroof and sliding doors both sides.    The middle seat flipped
down on both sides.

I also have seen two (identical, in different places) green and white 64
sliding sunroof microbuses with sliding doors and locking steering columns.
