Subject: Any Syncros FS ?

Hi listmembers:

I'm looking for a late model Vanagon Syncro in good shape.  I live in
Maryland but would be willing to travel to neighboring states to take a look
at one.  If you would keep your eyes peeled for one in the Sunday papers and
post it as FS or dorp me an E-mail, I'd appreciate it.

Gary
