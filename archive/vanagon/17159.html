Yes, the click means your there.

Speaking of torque wrenches, I recieved a beauty at work last Friday (part
of a tangential flow filter system for harvesting bacterial fermentations).
Its a Hazet, beautifully finished, click type, 20 - 170 Nm. Must cost a
fortune, needless to say all who were around when it was being unpacked
cried &quot;dibs!&quot; for weekend use.
