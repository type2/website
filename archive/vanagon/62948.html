Subject: Re: Which Subaru engine?

For what it is worth, I also thing the legacy engine would make a better
choice.  Correct me if I am wrong but did the 6 cylinder come only in the
SVX?  If so you will have to consider the avaliability and cost of the
engine and replacement parts.  Not to mention, the strain on the drive 
train, you will also need a brake system upgrade to stop the
shoe box when you are doing 100+ with 7 people, while pulling the trailer
and the A/C blasting. Also subaru no longer produces the SUX?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I saw an ad for a Subaru 1800 4WD asking just GB#50 that 50 pounds for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; engine. Should I buy this as an insurance policy?

&gt; &gt; Lionel,
&gt; &gt; The 2.2L Legacy engine is a much better candidate- more power, more
&gt; &gt; efficient, more modern. Available in turbo version.
