Subject: RE: unknown engine thingie


&gt;My buddy just bought a t-1 engine, (1973, DP 1600, full compliment of
&gt;emmissions junk), and found somthing that neither of us is
&gt;familiar with (perhaps because we try to stay pre-'68 in our
&gt;seemingly neverending quest to avoid Utah's emissions restrictions
&gt;on simple to maintain and diagnose powerplants).  There's a line
&gt;leading from the driver's side heat riser pipe to the manifold at the
&gt;base of the carb.  I haven't seen it yet, but he says it looks stock.
&gt;Any ideas as to what this might be?


Found one of these on a '74 bug engine in COlorado. It's a connection
for an EGR valve. First time I've ever heard of one on a '73. Maybe that's
A california engine (did '73 California engines even have them?), or
maybe somebody put it on from a '74 engine, to put the engine in a '74
CA bug and pass emissions tests? Or maybe that's really a '74 bug engine
(rebuilt at some point with a '73 case?).

To my (limited) knowledge, '74 bug engines were the only year to have this.
