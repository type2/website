The hole is at the EGR pipes that are not plugged.  Sucking air
in through the EGR circuit and into the intake manifold(s) may
cause the engine to run lean.  Lean running makes the engine hot.

If you don't have a fitting on your exhaust for the EGR plumbing
and emissions inspections are not required, I'd suggest plugging
the EGR feed pipes.

Exhaust leaks may be found by warming up the engine and letting it
idle.  Plug the tailpipe momentarily and listen for hissing sounds
underneath the engine.
