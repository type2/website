Subject: '71 Bus ignition switch


Anybody replaced an ignition switch on an '71 Transporter recently?
This one seems different from the switch on my old '69 bus. the '71
needs only half a turn to go from &quot;running&quot; to &quot;steering locked&quot;,
while the '69 needed either 3/4 turn or 1 full turn (can't remember--
it was a long time ago!)

My questions are:

1.) Are there any unusual hassles involved in the replacement?

2.) Anyone got a working used one they wouldn't mind $selling?
