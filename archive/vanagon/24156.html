Subject: hello again  

Well, I'm am back at school again, and once again have accessto the list. 
Last year I was posting wanted 71 westy messages once in awhile. I 
bought Dave Black's over the summer.  If you remember he had blown the 
engine.  I have put a new engine in it and restored most of the interior. 
Now I'm looking forward to working on the outside.  It's great to be on 
the list again.
