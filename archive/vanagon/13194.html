Subject: Anyone know how to tune a judson supercharger?


Does anyone out there in never never land know how to properly tune a 
Judson supercharger?  I aquired one and have it on a 1500 single port.  I
have yet to run it as I am still waiting for a friend to make me an oil
reservoir, as when I bought it it had neither the resivor or drive pully.
I've had a custom pully made and once I get the tank (hopefully in the
next two weeks) I am curious how to tune it.  Nobody around here knows
anything about them.

HEATH VOGT
