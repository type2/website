&gt; I am now shopping for a GEX1600DP 
&gt; I called GEX For a Total to my door price they said $914.00
&gt; I just got off the phone with Rocky Mountain Motorworks and for the same GEX
&gt; 1600DP to my door they said $804.00
&gt; I dont understand this but just thought i would let you know
&gt; their # 1-800-544-5357
&gt; same factory backed warranty same everything.

I think I know why.  They just had a price increase.  That is what the
guy at GEX told me last night.  He said the price of the heads they 
are using has doubled and that RMMW prices would be increasing as 
well.  So, the $804 motor must be one they had sitting in stock that 
was built before the price increase on the heads.  The $110 sounds 
like what he told me last night.  I have the figures at home.  Jim
