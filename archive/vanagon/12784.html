Subject: 58 Deluxe For Sale

For a year and a half I have tormented over the fate of this bus with me.  
It is a 1958 Deluxe Hardtop, original salmon/chestnut, 49,500 original 
miles, I am second owner.  Everything is there except the crank start.  The 
bumpers (blade) are intact with rubber and all.  Seats are all in very good 
condition except front seat needs restitching.  Headliner is still in it but 
has torn and is falling.  Bus has lots o' rust (original MN vehicle).  Most 
of tool kit and extra fan belts are there.  All original tires (with tubes) 
still there too.  Coat hooks, ash tray, sun visor all in great shape.  All 
deluxe trim still there.  Everything is there, just the body and frame are 
real rusty.  I would like to get $2500 for it or it's parts.  I hate to see 
it parted out, but I would like to buy back my old bus that I drove out here 
from CA so I would like to sell it one way or another.
