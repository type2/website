Subject: Re:German VW WWW sites 

Here's one to try...

http://www.vw.iplus_dot_com/golf/index.html

This is VW AG's German home page, probably put out by the sales/marketing 
department. It's not updated very often, and is written in German. Some 
interesting pictures, like the VW Happy Family Golf Station Wagon.

And no van stuff :&lt;.
