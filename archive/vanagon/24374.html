Subject: Bus/Vanagon Intake Manifold Hose

I'm happy as hell right now, called Automotion today to see if
Porsche 914 intake manifold hoses were correct, and correct hell,
they are the exact same part number as the VW equivalent.  Everyone
who has not changed these and feels the need wait no longer. VW wants
$12.50 each hose (4 needed), WCM wants $42.50 for a set of 4 (not much
better). AUTOMOTION WANTS ONLY $2.50 per hose, $9.95 for the set, though
min shipping is about $8 so order some fuel line too while your at it.  The
hoses are OEM Continental, they buy in bulk and cut to length, why WCM
can't do better is beyond me.  Part is 039.133.241 (I think).  The
Automotion guys are great, the order taker I had, ran back and found
some guy who works there with a Bus who had just changed his to verify
they were correct.  They also sell the cloth covered and smooth fuel
line at about $6, and $11 per meter respectively, plus you will get
their catalog, which lists all the Lubro-Moly, Curil, and Locktite
products, neat German tools and other stuff.  I can't recall their 800
number right now, so call 800 info, they are in CA.  They sell two sizes
the corect for Buses and AC Vanagons is the part for 2.0 liter 914's.
BTW They do in fact sell cloth covered line in 3.5, 5, 7, 9, and 12 mm sizes
correct for most any VW need.
