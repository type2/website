Subject: oil question

I have an 82 vanagon. I installed a VDO oil temp guage last fall on the
sump and am wondering what the ranges should be and how accurate the guage
is. This winter in Colorado the temps were ranging around 180-210 around
town and 250 when climbing mountain passes. Now that it is warming up here
the temps are ranging around 250 all the time. Is this normal or high? I
installed a GEX last fall also, so the engine only has around 4000 miles
on it. Also is there anyway to get the oil temp down on the 82? Thanks for
your help.
