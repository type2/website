Subject: Pictures of Lief

Well I finally got a few pictures of Lief scanned.  I still haven't learned any HTML so 
you'll have to deal with my completely uninspired home page but....

The pictures were taken at the VW show in North Vancouver a few weeks ago (while Tobin 
was trapped in a hot tob up a Whistler -- or was that someone else?).
