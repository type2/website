Hmmmmm....

David Easterwood sez:

&gt;If it ain't split, it ain't sh*t!!!

Taking this one more logical step, is it not reasonable that:

If it _IS_ split, it _IS_ sh*t!!!  ???

I've often seen T-shirts with similar sayings, extolling the virtues of
Harley-Davidsons, usually being worn by very large individuals.  I've
often wanted to discuss this logic with the wearers, but... well... I
just never seem to have the time.
