Hi Volks,

Well, since the '86 is inactive while figure this whole &quot;rich running&quot; deal
out I thought I would finally fix the AC. The compressor was locked up when
we bought the van and my wife (and her students) have been complaining
bitterly since :-)

Anyway, thanks to whoever posted the info on Vintage Air!

I ordered a *NEW*, yep, a *NEW* Standen 508 compressor for $190!! It's
going to take 2-3 weeks though, but that beats the pants off any local or
mail order rebuilt! And it's *NEW*!!

I'll let you know how it works out.

Love this list!
