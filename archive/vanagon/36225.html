Subject: Re: 68 vw bus $550 runs &amp; looks great (Concord, Bay Area)


&gt;Just so everybody who wants to know knows.  I am going to go down Tuesday
&gt;and take a look at it.  probably will buy it if it is in good shape.  My
&gt;wife tells me I can only end up with ONE bus so either this one or the one
&gt;I have may end up being a parts bus.  Anyhoo, will let you know either way.

In my experience, a baywindow that's anywhere near that condition--
or even noticably worse as long as it runs-- that is going for that price,
will be bought real quickly. Good luck!

If I were you, I'd:

(a) Make sure it's still there, and
(b) Check with Higher Authority (the one you cited) on whether a &quot;parts
bus&quot; qualifies as &quot;another bus&quot;. Else it may become &quot;another domicile&quot;.

Caveat Emptor
