Don asks about head-repair:

Import Service magazine ran a feature article on renewing the 
wasserboxer heads, it's only a few pages long but it has very nice 
photos and accurate descriptions of the proceedure.  It wouldn't be a 
complete 'how-to' source but it will take the mystery out.

Email me with your snail mail address and i'll send you a copy of it. 
 I can do this for a few others too.  It would be nice if we could 
get a high-res scan of the article but that's beyond my hardware and 
personal abilities.  tho i do have a Logitech 256 grey handscanner at 
home, writes in .tiff format.
