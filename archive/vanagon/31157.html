Your tranny is also vented to the atmosphere.  The vent is located on the
nose cone, just above the gear selector rod.  It doesn't pump the water in as
does the engine vent but if you submerge the nose cone you can expect to get
water in the tranny.

so true!  The 66 in progress (blue and white standard micro, nice headliner)
was sitting in the low part of a field last winter.  It was, at the rainiest
part of the year, a pond/stream.  Water got into the trans.  It came out when
the oil was drained, (personal decision - change tranny oil in any bus of
unknown maintenance)  along with a lot of guck.  I hope it will be ok.

guy who had it said he drove it a few years back.  So the tranny was okay
then. He got it from his ex girlfriend, who got it in the divorce from her
exhusband, in whose name it still was.   Finally figured out how to deal with
the title thing, which is easier in washington than some other states.

I built the long block, now am cleaning engine tin, and getting all the bits
together.  My partner's been doing rust repair - patching front floor,
windshield ledges, replacing passenger rocker panel (was completely gone),
and patching the cargo floor.   I took out the pop out windows and will
replace them with ones with actual frames that are still there.  Uncracked
windshields are in, with new seals, and roofing tar as extra sealant.  I
replaced the locks witha set with one key from a bus long gone.  Bus is now
12V, with halogen headlights.   

Cleaned out an intake yesterday.  Drilled out the accessable carbon buildup
at the ends.  Tried scratching with a coathanger.  That didn't do much.
 Couldn't blow through it.  Started banging on it with a big hammer.  A
little black dust came out.   Drilled some more.  More black dust.  Got the
propane torch (watch out - pyro on loose - I love that propane torch)  And
heated it up.  Glowed.  Dunked it in the water bucket.  Not enough water in
the bucket,  so I went out to the well house with another bucket and got the
drippings from the leaky pipe.  Poured them on the intake and then took the
torch to it a couple more times.  And now, when I pounded on it, low and
behold,  all this black guck started pouring out.  Chunks  Bang, tap bang
tap.  Till no more came out.   Then I heated it up again.  Dunk in sizzling
water.  Blew the torch into the intake to dry it out inside, steam coming out
the other end.  I detected an odd odor,  and lit the fumes coming out with e
the striker.  They burned! Looked kinda neat.  That buildup aint just carbon.

Maybe a bit involved,  but it'll run better with a nice clear intake.
