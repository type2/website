Subject: Re: VB: Getting bubbles out of cooling system

&gt;The instructions that I got from a VW expert were as follows:
&gt;Lift the BACK end of the van as high as possible.
&gt;Rev the engine to over 2000rpm and keep topping up the expansion tank =

I don't believe it!  This makes a low point in the system by the spare tire,
high point 3 feet up at rad/heater core.  No way is the pump pushing enough
water to blast any air lock at the top of the rad down 3 feet and out.
Raising the front puts all the piping pointing uphill from the engine, with
bleed screw at highest point. No traps for the air.  Tim Smith
