Subject: help on 76 westy

Howdy volks, this summer is the summer of maggies restoration (slow but sure).

The current problem:  a grinding sort of noise at idle.  It's a real low
key noise, and has an element of randomness to it, it sort of sounds like
heavy metal pieces grinding and clanking.  Any ideas?

The usual info:

76 westy, 2000cc, AFC, auto...

Thanks,
Eric and Maggie
