Subject:      midwest boneyard locations

pete sellers mentioned thses boneyards, which he saw as he motored his
EV around on the right side of the GNATT. :)

Just north of the intersection of Highway 63 and Interstate 44, in
Rolla, MO, there was a &quot;reclamation Facility&quot; with many, many VWs
(both busses &amp; bugs) right in the front view.

Approximately 20 miles south of Jefferson City, on Highway 63, there
was a &quot;body shop&quot; with about a dozen busses in front. There was even
something that looked like a 'heavily modified' bus; it had an
obviously shortened body and appeared to have room only for four seats
and no more space.

On Highway 2, near Nebraska City, NE (between Council Bluffs &amp; Nebraska
City-near the Nebraska/Iowa/Missouri border), there was a LARGE
&quot;reclamation Facility&quot;  with rows and rows of busses in view.
