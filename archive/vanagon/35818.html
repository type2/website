Subject: /f: You know your to deeply in 


You know your to deeply into VWs, when you go to your local pub quiz
and one of the questions is

&quot;Which VW model featured in the last video by Take That?&quot;

Well, none of us had seen the video (or heard/seen anything by Take 
That I hasten to add), but we decided that it would probably
be something kewl, so we choose a split screen bus as having
a good a chance as anything.

The answer, though, was &quot;Paula Hamilton&quot;! Uhhh?

They didn't mean which VW model, they meant which (catwalk) model that has 
appeared in a VW advert. Everyone else in the pub understood correctly,
which I think just shows my minds to one track when it comes to VWs.

(BTW how many cylinders did the Paula Hamilton have? Was it aircooled :))

cheers
