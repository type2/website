Subject:      Re: EuroVan tires

Ibid! identical experience with the identical tire in Dallas last year
for '95 Eurobago.  The Goodyear wore unevenly on the rear tires, were
noisy and I replaced same at 25,000k.  The Michelin MXLs were
noticeably smoother and quiter.  Like you, it was like pulling teeth
to get the tire ordered from Michelin.  However, definitely worth the
wait.
