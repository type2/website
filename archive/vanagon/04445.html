Well, I wouldn't go that far.  I didn't really like the idea of having a
73 bus either, but I got a great deal on it, and it has provided me with
6 years of good camping now.  Even with the less-than-perfect type IV
engine, when compared to other RV's, it haas the advantages of getting a
consistent 20 mpg, and being able to go places where no other RV could
dream about going.  I routinely scare my passengers by driving up old
dirt mining and logging roads that are classified for 4-wheel drives, but
that is the only way to really &quot;get away from it all&quot;, as far as I am
concerned, and there are times when I need to do that.  Piece of shit
indeed!
