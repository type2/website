Subject: Re: Wanted: Eurovan (Portland, OR)


I want to add a couple of additional comments regarding Pete, Norman
and other EV'er's comments, and that is I expect that my EV will be
around for 10 years or more.....based on two factors. 1. the construction
of the body is as solid as any VW Van I have ever seen...and judging
by the amount of older VW vans, it should survive well into the 21st
century. BTW, I have a copy of a German Magazine's crash test
of the T4 (from Gute Fahrt?) in which they not only did the
usual safety tests, but the off center front end crash test, and the
T4 did the best of all the European offerings (including the Chrysler
Shitboxes)....

2. The drive train should be able to deliver at least 150k miles. This
is based upon my personal experience with both Audi 5000s (with the
5cyl gas engines) and the engine/drive train of my GTI (which has
215k miles and still going strong).

With that in mind, the price I paid for the vehicle is more like an
investment!
