Jim etc.,

My guess is tread separation on one of your tires.  This may be very hard 
to spot since the tread may be loose from the belt, but still firmly 
attached to the tire.  You may be able to spot it by watching each tire at 
the spot where it deforms at the road surface as someone else slowly rolls 
the bus along.  The tread may distort (bulge?) just before it contacts the 
road at the tread separation spot.

Another option is a good tire shop.  They've seen it all, and should be 
able to check the tires for you.

I've had this problem about 6 times now.  In at least two cases, I was not 
able to spot it until the tread actually tore away from the tire.

Drive carefully,
Mike
