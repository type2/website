Subject: Re: GNATT East!

&gt;I'm going to be going to Boston in late May/early June, and would love
&gt;to jump in on the caravan for a while.  Especially if we're heading to
&gt;Cape Cod or somthing.
&gt;David Carment, Michael Heron, Want to head out together

i'd like to only two small problems:

1) my stock 65' Westy would be hard pressed to keep up to you H2O'ers

2)American Border police (or whatever the kinder gentler word is) *love*
going over my bus with a fine toothed comb (i.e. hassle supremo!). What is
it about splits? I think the border people must have watched too many
Cheech and Chong movies and get a mental pic. of every split window bus
owner as rivalling Bob Marley in consumtion of cannabis realted products!

BTW my bus is *stock* not a peace and love machine (no dis' intended to
those whose vehicles are :)

&gt;Any other Ontarians interested?
&gt;
