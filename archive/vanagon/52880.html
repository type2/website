Subject: Re: THE BEST BOOK FOR VANAGON REPAIR


&gt;Since I have moved out to Louisiana I have found it hard to find anythng
&gt;VW related. Can anyone reccommend a good shop manuel for an '84 VW
&gt;Westfalia? Seems Bently is the book of choice. Is this so? Where can I
&gt;get the best deal on one? Anyone want to get rid of an old used book?

Actually, the Bentley is the ONLY book that covers the water-cooled 
Vanagon, other than the almost totally useless generic Chilton import book. 
(The Clymer that somebody mentioned covers air-cooled only.)  It is a bit 
technical, but is very complete (phone book-sized, over 1100 pages), and 
the only game in town.
I have a wholesale account with the distributor, and sell the book for $62 
plus shipping. (Cover price is $90.)  Email me directly for ordering info.
