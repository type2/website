Subject: RE: Porsche Power (was: Self-Introduction)

Original article that got me salivating about Porsche-powered VW van was
a 72 van with a Turbo six, so it can be done.  I wouldn't want to work on
an engine that didn't have an access hatch over it, and you'd have to
measure to see if the engine-compartment height is sufficient, but the
mount to the trans is the same.  I think there is some sheet metal work to
do because the breadloaf is shorter from transmission to rear bumper than the
Vanagon.

My 71 2.2 engine had been in a breadloaf before I got it, but I never saw
that installation, so I don't know what was involved.
