Subject:      Free Vanagon parts in trade for labor

I have an '81 Vanagon parts van that needs to go (neighbor complaining).  I
need the engine, gas tank, windshield, and maybe trans out of it, but
that's it.  Don't have time to pull these parts.  If anyone or ones  near
the Philadelphia area were willing to pull these parts for me, in exchange
they could have cash plus anything or everything else on the van they want.
 It is not a camper.  Must be done within one week. Could give direction on
how to remove parts. Bring tools, and you are responsible for your own
safety.  If interested p-mail me.
