&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are Eurovans that bad?   :-)
&gt;
&gt;No, they're just more expensive and harder to work on!
&gt;
&gt;Seriously though, consider that:
&gt;- the microbus was available in US for approx 10 years (57? - 67)
&gt;- the bus was available in US for 11 years (68 - 79)
&gt;- the van was available in US for 12 years (80 - 92)
&gt;- the eVan was available in US for 2 years (93, then the 95 Camper)
&gt;
&gt;my definitions and dates may be slightly off, and I don't have statistics for
&gt;actual production figures. I know that EVs have not sold well, in part
&gt;because they were expensive, in part because they were diss'ed by Consumer
&gt;Reports and other trade publications because they weren't more like the
&gt;other minivans sweeping the market. They built it on a truck chassis, and
&gt;lo and behold, it drives like a truck - not a station wagon! Actually it
&gt;feels remarkably similar to the Vanagon, only with more power. (Well, the
&gt;front end doesn't raise up so much when you hit the gas either!)

As a newbie to Type II vehicles, it was confusing to understand the
various models being mentioned until someone in the current coffee
discussions sorted it out for me.  Now, would someone complete the list
and fill in the years that each model was produced.  Also, what are the
descerning features of Barndoors, Splitters and Breadloafs.  I own a '90
Vanagon and a friend has a '93 EV so I know about these two.

On again, off again in my 1990 Vanagon.
Scamper from Vancouver's damper in my Westfalia camper!
