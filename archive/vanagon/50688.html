&gt;Anyone got any ideas?? 

Yes.  Your brakes are rusted to the drums.  I bet that it was raining on your
trip up. I've had this happen a couple of times.  I've been able to free the
offending brake once by applying the engine power against it alternating
forward &amp; backward and twice by hitting the brake drum with a hammer.  I
haven't found an elegant way to free up a rusted brake yet.  Now, when
driving in rain I &quot;ride the brakes&quot; for a few moments before parking the van
in hopes of heating the brakes up to evaporate any water inside the drum.  I
can't say with certainty that this works, but I haven't had the problem in a
coupole of years now.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
