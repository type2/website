Subject: Re: Ethanol

Ethanol:

Every winter, to reduce air pollution, gas stations in the more polluted
US cities (most of them) are required to add a certain amount of ethanol
or other &quot;oxygenated fuel&quot; to their gasoline.  I am unsure of the
percentage, but 15 sounds about right.  I have not experienced any
problems other than a reduction in gas mileage (1-2 mpg). At the same
price, there is less value as you will go less miles per dollar.  On the
other hand, think of the wonderful things you are doing for the air. 

Methanol:

Don't do it.  I got a tank of methanol enhanced gas once and it came near
to ruining my bug.  Methanol is an excellent cleaneras well as being a
powerful solvent.  It will clean the living sh*t out of your engine at the
very least.  If you have a high mileage vehicle (who, me?) that stuff may
be all that is your engine together.  My bug sounded like it was about to
explode.  I was sure I was about to throw a rod.  In addition, Methanol
will disolve some plastics, like fuel injection hoses and carburetor
floats.
