&gt; In preparation for my trip to Kansas City to deliver Bob Polys' engine, I
&gt; swung by the gas station this afternoon and took on 33 gallons of fuel,
&gt; $49.83.  The cashier became increasingly nervous as the numbers clicked up on
&gt; the pump.  When I was done she she said &quot;I didn't think Volkswagen's held
&gt; that much.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;I have to go to Kansas City.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Oh....  &quot; looking very puzzled.
