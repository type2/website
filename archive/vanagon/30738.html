Subject: removing the fan housing, engine in car?


Well I finally got the thermostat parts that the dread
PPO (aren't they usually worse than the PO?) removed from
my bus. (though I still need a return spring and some of those
little clips that hold the connecting rod on, anyone
have any of these?)

My question is, can I remove the fan housing to install
these parts without removing the engine from my bus ('62),
or is it just too big a pain?

Thanks in advance,

Mark
