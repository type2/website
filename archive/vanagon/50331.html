Subject: Front speaker replacement

I have purchased some 4&quot; speaker which I would like to pop into the  
front doors.  Do the grills just pop out or do I have to remove the  
entire panel?  Could I get some hints on how to go about removing  
the panel, as Bentley seems to be murky on this?

advTHANKSance.

Cheers,
  - pavneet
