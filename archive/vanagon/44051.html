Wayne,

I've had similar problems on my '74.  Everyone on the list has been
helpful in giving advice.  I think I may have fixed the problem, thanks to
the many tips recieved.

I finally changed the plug wires.  This mad a huge difference in the way
it ran.  Also, make sure the timing is correct-mine was off by only a few
degrees and it was noticeable.  Also, the big problem that I had was with
the vacuum advance unit.  My bus has a weird two directional vacuum
advance/retard mechanism that yours doesn', but I'd check it all the same.
If you have a stick, it is very difficult to test if this is the
problem-the advance only works in fourth gear(why I don't know).  I'd
recommend replacing the advance because it is an easy repair and should
only cost about $15 from a junkyard for a replacement.

One more thing.  There is a braided cable wire that is inside the
distributor, nest to the points.  Check to make sure it isn't broken.  Let
me know how it turns out.

Craig
