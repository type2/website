Subject: 

&gt; FEDERATION INTERGALACTIC STARSHIP cloaked to resemble a 1973
&gt; Volkswagen beetle.  Over 110,000 parsecs of experience behind her, all
&gt; her functions are normal, including a quiet-running dilithium crystal.

If I hadn't been killed off in the last movie, I'd be interest in going 
where no man has gone before.
