&gt; Hi All.  I use a product made in Germany called Wenol.  It can be 
&gt; used on all metals.  They even make one specifically for Automobile

Sold in the new WCM catalog V12, BTW this is an incredible catalog,
much better than the last one from the late '80's I had, the product
line keeps getting bigger and bigger but the prices on late bus 
door weatherstrip are getting ludicrous, glad I bought some extra
and some damn vent window seals five years ago.
I use to use a product called NEVER DULL, was a chemical impregnated
rock wool material, worked fairly nicely, would polish off rust
and heavy oxides and leave a protective coat of oily stuff and was
only slightly abraisive.
