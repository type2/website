&gt;So, the moral of the story is: If your oil pressure light glows steady,
&gt;suspect the alternator and/or voltage regulator.
&gt;
&gt;

Cause of high Alternator voltage is usually a bad rear bearing.  This causes
the rotor to short against the regulator and ground causing the voltage to
sky rocket.  Not only does this condition cause the &quot;Dynamic Oil pressure&quot;
control system to go crazy, think what it does to the engine computer.  I
recomend that at 80K or so, the bearings and the brushes should be inspected.
 If the bearings are replaced before they fail, you can do the job yourself.
 Once they damage the housing or shaft, might as well by the rebuild.
