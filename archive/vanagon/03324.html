Subject: Great Canadian Bug Show

Hi folks,

Who's goin' to the bug shows this sunday?
Who's goin to the Toronto one?  If you're considering, but don't know if 
it's worth it,  you should!  Every year that I've been it's been great!
Lots of every kind of VW built H2O and AIR,  plus they always have a 
coupla of Hebmuller(sp.?) around for us to drool over.
Hope you come!

I'll be the White 85 Vanagon in the parking lot,
(I know 80% of 'em are white)

Cheers 
SStones			Toronto Ont.

85 Vanagon
