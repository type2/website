Subject:      Re: the muir solonoid trick ... numbers explained

&gt;ignition switch was closed.  That is, if I turn the key to
&gt;&quot;on&quot; (not &quot;start&quot;), the solenoid didn't kick in, only when
&gt;the ignition switch was on &quot;start&quot;.  Thus it stands to
&gt;reason that when the switch returns to the &quot;on&quot; position
&gt;after I let go of it, it would break the circuit between
&gt;the solenoid and battery.  But what do I know, I'm a
&gt;software guy :-).

that's what i meant ... to be sure NOT to hook it to the &quot;ON&quot; wire, but the
&quot;start&quot; wire. you said what i thought i meant for you to understand. :)

&gt;But this brings up my next question... when Muir talks about
&gt;this he says to connect the lead for the battery to the &quot;B&quot;
&gt;plug on his regulator (or &quot;B+&quot; sometimes).  Well I have a
&gt;'76 Bus so it has an alternator, and the regulator only has
&gt;D, DF, and D+ plugs (I think).  What's the equivalent?  I
&gt;assume what he wants is a hot lead from that battery that
&gt;has been regulated to 12V.

yup. the Bosch book says that
B+  -&gt;  Battery positive
B-      Battery negative
D+      Dynamo (generator) positive
D-      Dynamo negative

but! you're gonna have to get some electrical whiz to explain that diagram
in the muir book (i assume you're talking about the one way back in the back,
in the Changes and New Ideas (page 446 in my edition) about page52.

all i can see it doing is adding just a little bit of extra juice to the
original vw solonoid (from the ignition wire). what i did to get better
starting on my 80 bus was to run a big-mutha wire from the battery negative
terminal straight to the starter ground (one of its mounting bolts). this
helped a lot (or so it seemed to me). but it was a pain to route that big
wire and i had to propane-torch-solder the fittings on the end (a dinky little
electric soldering gun just don't get it!). so i haven't &quot;gotten around to it&quot;
on my 88 bus. :(

hope it helps.
