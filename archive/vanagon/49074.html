Subject: Tires again! Please help!!!!
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

I'm having a very hard time finding tires. MXL's are suposedly
discontinued and My tire guy hasn't been able to find MXT's. I've found
some 185/14 light truck tires but they look very narrow. I have them on
my Nissan p'up. They work well but I'd like to use the original size
tire on the Vanagon. Any help would be appreciated.

Justin
