Subject:      Where to put oil filter on 69



I have a new engine! But now that I am going to have an oil filter for the
first time ever, where is the best place to place it in my 69 campmobile. Its
the Gene Berg full flow type. Supposedly in the engine compartment is a bad
idea, so where do you bolt the sucker on?
