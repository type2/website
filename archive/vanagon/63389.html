hiya Chris - i carried a 450 in my '85 for a while.  it wasn't the best fit,
but it worked.  open the sliding door, put a ramp up.  i didn't try to get
the fork between the front seats (don't remember why) but i found it would
get in there with the handlebars turned all the way (mirrors removed).  it
was tight and i had to actually lift and pivot the machine to get it snug.
[make sure the engine is cold or you'll burn your legs on the muffler!]
as for tying it down...my solution was to wrap the snot out of it.  i
wrapped it around the doors (had to climb in the window), seats and mounting
brackets for the rear seat.  the sliding door barely shut this way, but it
worked.  good luck.

Rik
