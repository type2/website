Subject: RE: Poptop Canvas

Hi there.  I don't recommend scotchguarding or other treatments to 
the canvas of your poptop.  We've yet to have our canvas leak in some 
unbelievable rainstorms.  The canvas is naturally waterproof.  
There's lots of info in the archives on this subject.  The canvas 
must breathe, and by treating it is won't breathe, and you'll have 
extra condensation in your van because of it.

Hope this helps.
Harry.

&gt; I've had my top popped in some heavy NW deluges and it doesn't leak. At 
&gt; first it did, then I tightened all of the screws that held the canvas to 
&gt; the top. Still I'm going to treat the canvas with a product like 
&gt; ScotchGuard. That should make the water bead up and not soak in to the 
&gt; canvas.

&gt; Can anyone recommend a treatment for the canvas so I can keep the top
&gt; popped in the rain?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx!
