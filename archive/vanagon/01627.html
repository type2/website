JC Whitney has a $25 carb synchronizer (carb throat air flow gauge) and a $125
CO meter.  I have and use the $25 piece on the six carbs of a Porsche engine.
Works fine.  The $125 piece I have not seen, but a posting on another group
described it as cheaply made (ie don't drop it) but works.

I like JC Whitney, as long as I'm not in a hurry.  Have always wondered how
they determine what to carry, as their coverage of VW Type II parts is so
spotty.  I also remember John Muir's words about them: &quot;If it says no sanding
or drilling, you may have to weld.&quot;
