Subject: drums to discs.

     Ok dudes here's my question.
     
     I have a mate who has a '68 Bay Window bus, and it's getting a big 
     motor (Type IV, Porcshe fan etc.). Now we need to put discs up front 
     to stop the bugger from 110mph!
     
     Ok so we know about the '68 ball joint beam thing so the discs can 
     bolt straight on, but can they?
     
     Has anyone done the disc brake conversion on the '68 beam ?
     
     Do you need to change the master cylinder for a later one ?
     
     Lee.
