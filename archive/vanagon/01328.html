Subject: Re: Right Plug? also, #3, lightly toasted...

well, I checked the valve lash... #3 exaust was dead on, intake was a 
little loose... Sigh. Only other thing is that around the #3 exuast, on 
the head inside the cover, there are massive carbon (?) deposits, the 
rest of both heads are sparkling clean (these were new heads, not 
rebuilt). The deposits go from behind the spring to the adjacent head 
nut, and forward (F is F). Could this be related to the #$_at_! messed up 
heat exchanger I recently replaced? It had a fair exaust leak...

Also, as to plugs... I double checked the bosch plugs I had in it. The 
were W7rc (or whatever--forget the letters), not '8's. I get mixed up as 
to how this affects the heat range. Any takers?
