&gt; 	Well, the morning paper reveals a 63 Crewcab, rebuilt engine,
&gt; new paint and interior. $4900. I talked to one of the owners last
&gt; night. They did a bare-metal restoration on it, overhauled
&gt; everything execpt the transmission, welded-in a new pillar
&gt; between the front windows and repaired all other rust damage,
&gt; and they've been showing it at the local bay area gatherings. 
&gt; (Its grey, with a roof-rack. Anyone seen it?)
&gt; 	But now they want to sell it because it has to sit outside, 
&gt; and should be garaged, and they're remodelling the house and need the money.
&gt; 	I'm seeing it tomorrow.
&gt; 	Other than the tranny, this sounds like a basicly
&gt; remanufactured 1963 double cab!! (It's 12V).
&gt; 	How does $4900 sound for bare-metal-up, new rubber,
&gt; etc etc etc?
&gt; 
&gt; 	Having not seen it, my biggest reservation is that
&gt; I wouldn't want to damage the paint *using* it- I guess I'd
&gt; need a bed-liner too. Does anyone know of bed-liners for
&gt; split-window crew cabs? I guess my alternative is to make my own
&gt; liner out of marine plywood and epoxy paint...
&gt; 
&gt; 	Yes, I'm excited! Yes, I'll try it in all 4 speeds forward
&gt; and reverse. Yes, I'll ask to see the recipts, expect to see a
&gt; few K miles on the rebuild, look at the floors under the mats, etc.
&gt; 	My friend Rob recomends I ask about undercoating. Any other
&gt; suggestions? I plan to bring the Muir book with me and do the 
&gt; &quot;how to buy&quot; procedure.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Bill

 Sounds pretty exciting! Here's one more thing you may want to check:
 When I had my '64 Camper I had some trouble with loosening of 
 the mounting bolts which attached the reduction gear cases to that plate 
 which goes up to the torsion bar. Evidence of this problem is a scuffed area
 just larger than the washer under the aforementioned mounting bolt. Once the
 threads in the gear cases were trashed, the gear case itself had to be
 replaced!!!!

 Several weeks ago someone asked the Magliozzi Bros. (NPR Car Talk) about 
 dealer installed undercoating.
 Their response was something like &quot;Dealer installed undercoating is better
 at hiding rust than preventing it&quot;
