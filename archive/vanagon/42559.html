Subject: Re: 82 Vanagon,  banshee front pads!

In the shop I work in we use a couple of different methods to remedy 
this problem, We use a product on the surface of the pad called 
anti-squeel brand is Husky.  NOT anti-sieze.  The husky stuff has woked 
wellfor most cases but there have been a few no matter what we did there 
was still noise.

  Also you didn't mention whether or what you used on the back of the 
pads?
