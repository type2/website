I thought i'd defend dave here.  His vanagon is immaculate (not a scratch
on it that i could find.) Never seen a wad of bubble gum and he seems to
take care of mechanical problems as soon as they crop up.  Interior is
spotless. I had vanagon envy ;) mine is a POS!

Personally, if i had lugnuts that were painted silver by the factory and
the silver paint came off, id use a testors paint pen too, or any other
suitable means to replace the factory coating.  His dad had that van for a
long time so if he says the lugnuts were painted and it came off i believe
him.

my $0.02
