Subject: RE: Aux Battery

Thank you for the tip.  I call a local generator shop.  He installed (one
screw, 5min) an adjustable voltage regulator.  Hooked up a volt meter and
cranked up the voltage.  Now I have the isolator in the system and everything
is charging fine.

The adjustable regulator looks and costs the same as a fixed one.  I asked why
all alternators did not come with this feature?  The guy said that they
should, but it would put guys like him out of buisiness.

             - Craig

Craig:

I ran into a similar problem when I put in an aux battery several years
ago.  The solution is to install an adjustable voltage regulator in the
alternator and crank up the output voltage until you have 14.0 volts
coming out of the isolator.  The units should be available locally for
around $25.00.  Check with a local auto electrical repair shop.\

Worked for me.

Fred
