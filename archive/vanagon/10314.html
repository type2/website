Subject: Westfalia Horses &amp; Curtains

Sorry it's taken so long to respond to the requests for a source for =
the
plastic things the curtains run in the track on in your Westfalias! =
 =E3work
has been busy--the STUDENTS are coming back!! :-( but I guess that's =
why I'm
here...!  Das Bulli Haus in Franklin CT has them!  They're NOS and co=
st
$4 for 10 (found 'em in England).  Their number is (203) 642-7242.  I=
'm fairly
certain these are for the late-models only.  I believe the earlier We=
sties had
a different style.  They are correct for our '68 Westy/Dormobile, any=
way (it's
a production-line special ordered Westfalia with a Dormobile top &amp; co=
tts
brought back from England by a US military-man -- we found the origin=
al owners)

Now, about this Ferrari-esque horse on the Westfalias &quot;everyone&quot; was =
talking
about a few weeks ago (I know, I'm a little behind the times!), while=
 labeling
a box of new books/tapes for the Department the other day, I saw a pa=
ge in a
book that had the &quot;coat-of-arms&quot; for all the German &quot;states&quot;.  Westfa=
liawerke
is in Nordrhein-Westfalen, I beleive, (either that in Niedersachsen--=
either way
my theory works...) and the &quot;coat-of-arms&quot; for that state has the Fer=
rari-esque
horse in it.  Hope this clears up the mystery.  (the coat-of-arms for=
 Nieder-
sachsen also has a Ferrari-esque horse).  I'd certainly be curious to=
 find out
if this is indeed how the horse got there!
