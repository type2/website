Subject: Re: Retorque Heads?

Maybe David's talking about 6 hours if you leave the engine in. I'm no 
mechanic, but I'm confident I could drop the engine in my '71 (a 
different animal, perhaps), retorque the heads, and reinstall the engine 
inside of four hours..and I'm kinda slow at all this cause I'm kinda 
green too. I have dropped and reinstalled the engine by myself...and I've 
retorqued the heads too, so I'm not just blowin' smoke.

YMMV Joe

&gt; &gt; anything in Bentley, Haynes or Muir about retorqueing the heads.  Is it
&gt; &gt; possible to do this with out dropping the engine?  I can see getting
&gt; &gt; access to the lower head nuts but the upper nuts are under the tin. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is possible, but it's a major pain.  You will have to remove the
&gt; upper tin pieces to get at the eight upper cylinder head bolts, and to
&gt; do that you will have to remove the fuel injection.  I have not worked
&gt; on a FI bus engine so I don't know how hard this is, but I'm sure it's
&gt; not easy.  I'd estimate you would pay a professional mechanic at least 6
&gt; hours of labor to retorque the heads.
