Subject: Maple Grove, Pa. VW Show?

The Maple Grove VW show near Reading, Pa. is this Sunday.  In my 
opinion, the nicest VW show in this part of the country.  Much 
larger than any other except last month's Manassas show.  If you're 
anywhere nearby, it's well worth the trip.
  
I'll be there vending used bus parts.  Stop by and say hi!  I'll 
have a very ugly '63 Deluxe Bus (spray-painted blue &amp; white) 
and/or a Green '76 Westfalia with a For Sale sign on it.
