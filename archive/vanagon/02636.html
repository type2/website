Subject: T4 Synchros.....


My local magazine store, bless their pointy little heads.., is not
only carrying VolksWorld, but now VW Motoring as well as VW Motoring's
Beetle Collection!!!  Its nice to see magazines which emphasize 
the cars rather than the Tits and Ass of VW Trends and, from what
the latest covers seem to lean toward, DB&amp;HVW....but I digress....

The otherday someone mentioned T4 synchros....so in VW Motoring
(7/94) what should appear, but the following:

T4 SYNCHRO JOINS AMBULANCE FLEET

An all-wheel drive Transporter synchro, the first of its kind to be used as 
a control unit and rapid response unit, has joined the 130-strong North
Yorkshire Ambulance Service Fleet.

Based on a short wheelbase Transporter syncro, with the 2.4 litre diesel
engine, the converted vehicle replaces a trailer unit which previously
had great difficulty negotiating the rough terrain in North Yorkshire.

Coverted by Taurus of Stockport, the center part of the van is used as
an incident control area, while the rear part is used to house 
medical equipment. Standard equipment includes a 40ft telescopic mast
which carries floodlighting and an addtitional areal, 240 electricity,
a fuel-burning heater and a generator.



Below the article is a picture of the ambulance...NEAT!!!!



Also in the issue of VW motoring is an ad for a T4 &quot;pocket service
manual&quot;....so T4 owners...stand by...I'm going to try to get a 
copy from the UK....maybe multiple copies if there is any interest!
