Hey all,
	Check out the Jerque du Jour page today 1/29.
	http://www.got_dot_net/~egallant/the_road.html to see this one.  It
	has a picture of a Vanagon Westy passing a Jeep Cherokee and the
	guy says: hint, if you're being passed by a VW camper, you're
	not going fast enough.  Is that true or what? :) :) .  Anyway,
	the jerk was the Jeep, not the VW.  Apparently, the Jeep was
	hogging the left lane for a while while going very slooooooowly.
	This is a great page and that looks like a nice Westy....

	Sean
