&gt;I have a 1980 wesfalia.  I took apart my oil pressure relief valve the other
&gt;day, for cleaning/inspection.  I didn't know that copper crush washers were a
&gt;one time use thing.  I can't find them anywhere locally (Milwaukee, WI)  can
&gt;anyone help??

well ... TECHNICALLY, those copper washers are SUPPOSED to be used only once,
but ... i've been using them over and over for years with no leaks. if they
get kinda flattened tooo much, a porsche mechanic showed me a neat trick:
get a propane torch and heat them up until they (washers) are red hot, then
let them cool off somewhere. it 'fluffs' the washers back up. and i figure
if it's good enough for his 911's, it's good enough for my vanagon. :)

The Voice of Experience Speaks: do NOT try to hold the washer in your fingers!
use a pair of pliers. :)
