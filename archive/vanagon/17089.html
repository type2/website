Bruce,

Are you talking about the mildew on the inside (fuzzy headliner fabric) or are 
you talking about the fiberglass outer shell?

Hi there, I'm back on-line after about a month off!  I'm sure you all
missed me...ya right...who am I again?  Thanks to Steve, I just received
the flu covers on Friday!
I see you all have been talking about the mildew problem on the pop-tops.
I posed this question about 2 months ago.  Can you tell me the findings
ya'll have come up with as I haven't received any messages for over a month
now?  Good to be with you again, Bruce
