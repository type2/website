&gt;Someone was seeing how long their fridge would run on their Vanagon.  
&gt;Last thing I heard was like 12 days?  Any new status reports?
&gt;
&gt;

Run on what?  Gas, 110v, 12v?    I would imagine if you had a endless power
source (110v or possibily 12v) you could run it till it breaks.  Anyone had
any experience running a fridge for an extended period of time?  BTW, mine
ran fine for the 3 day weekend on 110 and 12v.
