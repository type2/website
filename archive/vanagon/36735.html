Subject: FS:Parts Vanagon 1984 

Hello All

Since I bought my 1986 Vanagon I will be selling my 1984 for parts.

Actually I am still driving it. It was hit from behind.  The insurance company 
did not total it and I am still driving it to work.

If anyone wants details please email me


Paulc 

I am in Connecticut
