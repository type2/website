&gt; 
&gt; I agree, Richard. And as stated earlier, there are plenty of great spots
&gt; in North Carolina--from Pisgah Nat'l Forest to Cape Hatteras. 

I would be more inclined to participate if the event took place within the
beautiful state of North Carolina.

I don't think I would particpate in any thing north of DC, west of the 
Smokies or south of Atlanta.
