&gt;     Wow.  Okay, I think that Ron wins the best bike rack award.
&gt;     Now, where in the States can I get one?

You can't.  You need to order it from Canada.  Don't ask me why, since it's
enormously popular there.  Paulchen just never imported it to the States.
The folks on the above-mentioned web page *will* ship here, however.
That's how I got mine.
