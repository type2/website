Subject: Re: head cap nuts- 'torque to hold'

&gt; 
&gt; Exactly, at least in my experience.  When the final torque is reached,
&gt; the nut will continue to turn for a little bit.  For me, after I held the
&gt; nut at final torque for a few seconds, when I let off it, it indeed
&gt; &quot;untwisted&quot; a bit.  I'm still wondering what to do about it.

Hi all: I have a factory bulletin about changing headgaskets in
water-boxer engines. It must say in there two or three times not to use
a click type torque wrench to torque the heads. I bought a dial type to
do my engines. Maybe what you are discussing in this thread is why they 
don't like ckick type wrenches.  Todd Francis
