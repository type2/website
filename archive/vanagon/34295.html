Subject: cold/infrequent starting

I hope that subject makes some sense.  I started my bus last night for
the first time in 12 days.  It has been about 0 F for about two weeks 
now.  I got to thinking:  when I started my engine new I was advised to
crank it over without the coil connected until the oil light went out.
Is something similar advisable for an engine that has sat for 12 days?
Does it do any good at all or is the oil still in the places I would 
try to get it to?  Thanks, Jim
