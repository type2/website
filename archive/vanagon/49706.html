Subject: Re: Moab, UT Splittie Sunroof Bus Rock Tours?

Jon,
	I know the company.  I've got some great pictures of their split 
window tour buses.  I don't think that they are still around any more.  
The last time I was in Moab I asked around and looked for them.  No 
luck.  This was over 5 years ago.  Anybody know different?  Gary Gibson
