Lisa's fuel pump relay may in fact be dead, but the symptoms hint at another
possibility.  The fuel pump is designed to be powered during startup, and
then to be powered while the engine runs.  If the engine stops, the fuel
pump is supposed to stop with it, even if the ignition is still on.  Some
cars (eg Porsche) use induction vacuum as the cue that the engine is still
turning.  VW Vgon uses (I think) oil pressure.  So if the oil pressure 
sender doesn't get off zero, the pump will stop when the key is turned from
start position back to on.

So that's where I'd stab my test lamp first.  The fuel pump relay is in the
northwest corner of the engine compartment, at the top of the north wall, 
held by a single sheet metal screw.  A silver box with electrical connectors
pointing down.  It's actually two relays in one box, so it costs more when
either one dies.  Good starting point for antitheft measures if you're 
into that sort of thing.  Also good spot for jumpering your fuel pump so
it runs all the time, eg for testing liters/minute or fuel pressure.

Good luck!
