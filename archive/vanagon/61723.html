It's probably time to start a public record.

Ten days ago I sent email to Volkswagen asking for a &quot;written, definitive&quot;
policy with regard to replacement of heating system components.
Specifically I want to know what will be replaced, for what model years,
under what circumstances, in which countries; so that that information can
then be propogated to the lists and ngs.

I sent email because I have no intention of spending time &amp; money on smail
in order to be ignored. Sent to webmaster_at_volkswagen_dot_com, because webmaster
and postmaster are two addresses that are always live. Email contacts (and
information on recalls) are conspicuously absent from www.volkswagen_dot_com.

Got the following reply: &quot;I have forwarded your request and you will
receive a reply soon.&quot; But I ain't got no reply. Tonight I asked for the
address to which my mail was forwarded, so I can nag them. We shall see
whether I get an answer.

The Waterboxer Head Game: replace it if they find out we will, but try to
keep it a secret. The Internet Game: trying to control the information flow
is not just futile, it's perilous.

Volkswagen could still impress me. They could be forthright. They could be
honest. They could say publicly what the private policy is, and there
obviously is a private policy. I hope they choose this course.

If not, though, the information that does not come through them will come
around them. Volkswagen AG, meet the internet. Pleased, so nice you could
come. We've heard so much about you.
