Subject: Subaru 2.1 transplant

Seems like there is some  interest out there in my posting on putting in the 
Subaru Legacy 2.2 litre engine. In a nutshell, here's what I know:

Kennedy Engineering makes the adaptor kit. It's about $500 US
The Subaru engine cost is about $1500-$2000.
Labour is time consuming, but not terribly difficult according to a local
auto wrecker guy I talked to who has done one.  The owner _loves_ the result.

The Legacy engine goes up to about 300,000 - 400,000 km .

They are more plentiful than the Vanagon engines.

Horespower is 130 for the non-turbo. (150 for the turbo)

It sure sounds good to me!  If I am going to keep the Vanagon long term this
is the way to go.

Kennedy's phone number is 805-272-1147. They have a brochure they will send
you called &quot;Repowering the Vanagon.&quot;

If anyone has done this or is planning to do it soon, let me know how it works,
I'm planning on doing mine next time the heads or other major engine part
lets go.

Ed
