Subject: Bosch CIS problems

Hi All,
   I need some input.  I have a 82 Westy Diesel that I converted to gas
using a 83 Rabbit GTI motor. I used the stock CIS fuel injection.  All has
been well until it started getting cold.

My problem:  1st, It started skipping.  Not ignition related.  checked
everything, cap,rotor,wires plugs,halls unit and control unit, everythings
OK and most of it is new.. It would skip worse when I gave it more thottle.
Then as suddenly as it started skipping it stopped.  Ran great, for a
while.  When it started again I decided to check FI parts.  Everything I
could check with a test light and multimeter, except Fuel pump seemed to
check out. Finally I borrowed a fuel gauge and the pressure seemed fine,
about 68psi.  Now the book said pressure was ok but the cold pressure
seemed high. Lets put it this way the pressure never dropped below 50 from
start-up til operating temp.  When the car was off the pressure dropped to
28psi and stayed there for the time allowed when checking for leaks.
However fuel pump output was less than 16oz for 30sec operation.  Book said
at least 32oz.  I replaced the fuel pump.  Output great over 32oz of 30sec
operation.  The engine didn't run anybetter right away.  Then suddenly bam
runs great. And has seemed to run good ever since. Although a couple of
times I felt it skip under acceleration. Problem #2  Now it doesn't like to
stay running cold.  I have to start the van between 8 and twelve times
before it will stay running. It driving me crazy.  I hooked a gauge to it
today.  It never dropped below 70psi right from the start. I've been told
its the warm up or control pressure regulator.  I guy at the GM shop I work
at said its the injectors. (He's an old Saab tech and said Saab and VW used
same injection system, he also said injectors where Saabs big problem when
they were cold and ran crappy.) I'm at my wits end. HELP.  I can't afford
to buy more parts just to have them not completely cure them problem.  At
first I thought this problem was because of something I did during the
refitfrom the rabbit. I have checked and triple checked everything
associated with fitting the FI from the rabbit and it checks out OK.
Please help me.  Thanks for your help.  I think in the future when money
allows I'm going Digijet(?) Injection from an 88 or newer Golf or Jetta.
Looks like alot less parts and wires. Probably cost twice as much to fix.=)
E-mail me or post a reponce to the list. Thanks.  By the way the
convertion from diesel was fairly easy, if anyone want to know E-mail me.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
