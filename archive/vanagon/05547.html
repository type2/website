I have not seen the street camping topic discussed on the list.

Our first time street camping was in the Los Angeles area. We were at the
DisneyLand and when we came out it was around midnight. Instead of checking
into a hotel we found a safe neighborhood and slept in our 85 Westy on the
street. On that same trip out west we did this several times and did not
get into any trouble.

With three kids now I don't think we can do it anymore but I am curious to
hear what are others experience in this regard. Is it illegal to sleep in
your car on a public street?
