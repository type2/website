&gt; As for THE TRIP, I don't see how a decent, self-respecting VW caravan
&gt; could neglect to pass through Montana.
&gt; 

If the trip does happen to pass through Montana, make sure that it
hits Butte on St. Patrick's Day.  My wife and I passed through there
on the way to South Dakota, and let me tell you, it was not what I
expected.

We left Pullman, WA, early in the morning.  After driving many hours
through the Rocky Mountains, we begin our descent into Butte.  I 
expected to find a sleepy burg, beaten down by the depressed economy.
It's 1pm, driving through town, and I'm looking for a gas station to fill
the Diesel Jetta.  I notice that the streets are empty, until we hit the 
&quot;downtown&quot; area.  Where I find:

Thousands of cowboys and cowgirls, with green clothes, green hair,
green facepaint.  Hopped-up 4x4's cruising the streets, screaming,
yelling and singing...

Drunken revelers, spilling out of the bars.  There's no age limit in
Butte on this day, for sure!  Adults and kids alike, chugging down
cold ones and rushing to the next bar.  Not a sad look on anyone's
face.  The beer must have been free.

I pass through the party, becoming concerned because the needle has
now dropped below the orange.  A few blocks later, a gas station 
appears.  As I went in to pay, the first thing the lady behind the counter 
asked me was: &quot;Are you crazy or sane?&quot;

I said I was from out of town.
