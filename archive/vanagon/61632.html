I've been messing with the seats on my two '80's to get a pair of them 
that have some cushioning.  I've been switching passenger to driver 
occasionally to even out the wear.  Fortunately the backs on one are 
good and the bottoms on the other are good!  Mixnmatch time!

However, I've lost track of which is supposed to go where!

The only difference I've found is where the controls are located.

One has both front/back and tilt controls on the same side, and the 
other is on the opposite side.  Which goes where?

Of course the enquiring mindless want to know WHY the controls are 
different?

It woulda been cheaper for VW to make them the same, but 
obviously VW felt that there was valid/good reason for making them 
different.  I haven't noticed any difference between using either 
seat in the driver position though.  The only reason I can think of is for 
the driver's controls to be on the left, away from the handbrake.
