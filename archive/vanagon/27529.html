OK, several people asked about the canvas divider setup I just created.

Imaging sitting in the back of your bus with a warm mug of tea/coffee/grog/blood
or whatever.  You are looking toward the front.
             
   __--*----*-=====-*---*---__
  /*                         *\ 
 /          ---------          \
 |          |       |          |
 |          ---------          |
 |*                           *|
 -------------------------------

the * indicates a snap location.

The window in the middle is optional.  I was thinking of using a thin
sheet of plexiglass, with holes drilled all round, and either sewing it
into the canvas, to using some sort of snaps.  You could also add a 
roll-up or velcro cover, so you could &quot;shut&quot; the window when you wanna
sleep in the bus.

For the fasteners, I used the tonneau cover style &quot;Lift the dot&quot; jobbies.
They are pretty easy to install.  Hint - get an Xacto knife.

Please note that I am still working on details of the design, and I'm 
considering this one to be a prototype.

Notes so far:  Make sure that the canvas fits snug against the metal.
Otherwise you get a nasty, high speed draft.  Put at least one
snap on each side at the bottom.  At freeway speeds, enuf air pressure 
builds up that the cover will want to join you in the front seat!  Also,
I am going to add additional snaps, prolly 2 on each side, on the B pillar,
to help hold it snug against the frame.

I also considered making a solid divider, like they used in the ambulance.
I have some good pics to go by, and all, but it didn't seem to make sense
to put a divider in a bus with a sunroof...
