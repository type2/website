Subject: Westfalia Mercedes 

Has anyone else looked over the Mercedes V-class website 
(http://www.mercedes-benz_dot_com/e/product/pkw/v klasse/06.htm) that 
Thomas Niksch brought to our attention?  This looks like yet another 
nice van that won't be available in the US.  Very reminiscent of the 
Eurovan in appearance.  Have any of the listmembers in Europe been 
able to drive one of these?
