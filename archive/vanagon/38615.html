Subject: 81 ASI recliner seats

I've got an '81 Vanagon camper with an ASI conversion.  The front seats
recline using a variable hydraulic recliner mechanism that is similar to
airline seat recliner mechanism.  In fact, it probably was intended for
airline use.

Mine are shot.  ASI has no idea where to find them any more.  The unit bear
the name &quot;Bloc-o-lift&quot; and the logo apparently of a company in Koblenz,
Germany &quot;Stabilus.&quot;  There is a part no. 06 08 110 313 / 0570 N 51/78 (some
scratches, but this seems to be the number.)  It's been modified by ASI
(probably) with a yoke of sorts welded onto the end of the shaft.

Has anybody ever run into this kind of unit or have any idea where I could
get a suitable replacement?  I've rigged a crank mechanism as a sort of
replacement, but it isn't very satisfactory, especially since it suddenly
put my wife flat on her back the last time out!

Help!

Charlie
