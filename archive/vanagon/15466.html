re..........
&gt;Just got a call from Gerald Gregory who is reproducing pre '68 Westy racks
&gt;and fold up Westy Ladders. He swears that they are exact to original.

any body seen these racks to see how &quot;original&quot; these repros are? i know
&quot;parts is parts&quot; in utah is selling these roofracks, but they quoted me a
price in the ballpark of $500.00 us. what are these roofracks so
outrageously expensive? they don't look that difficult to make? i mean if
you think about it, would you spend $400 or so on yakima or thule racks?

don't get me wrong, i'd really like one of these racks, i like vintage look
as much as the next person, but don't know that i could justify spending
$400 on a roofrack that can carry less weight than a yakima or thule (which
can be had for a fraction of the price). ANybody else have an opinion on
this one?
