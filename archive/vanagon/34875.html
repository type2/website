Subject: Warmer Webpage


	Since we have left our cold snap from hell, I am able
to get places and have fixed on my webpage and put a few VW type
things at it.
 
	Try http://www.icaen.uiowa_dot_edu/~mbushore if  you have
Netscape and a good connection.  I have an affinity for extraordinarily
large jpegs :)


Winter Van Starting Tip:

	Take the space heater that you normally leave in your van to preheat
your interior (my landlord pays electricity and I have a GFI outlet)
and put it in your engine compartment.  Take some cloth type items and
stuff them into your air vents.
 
	In about an hour, you will have a toasty warm preheated engine.  This got
me going when it was like -20F (COLD) so I could go jumpstart all of my friends cars.


Don't try any of this if you are afraid of starting your car on fire, but I figured
it was too damned cold for a fire to possibly start....
