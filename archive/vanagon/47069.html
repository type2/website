Subject: Westie Audio Woe

I thought I was prepared to install a nice CD changer/usual inputs 
audio system in my Vanagon Westie, when I discovered I was missing a 
couple pieces, so I visited a high-end auto audio business.  Without 
going into the diatribe to which I was subjected, I can say there's a 
well developed body of information/folklore surrounding audio system 
component selection and installation.  I'd be very interested to hear 
descriptions of speaker placements that others have found which image 
well and create a satisfactory &quot;sound stage.&quot;  Apparently the distance 
from each speaker used in a given channel to the driver's ears must be 
nearly identical to avoid screwing up that channel's phase 
relationshiops, unless you install a compensating phase shifter.  That's 
where my speaker placement ideas failed to measure up to high-end 
standards and I'm not ready to spend the money required to buy an 
adjustable &quot;phase shifter&quot; to time-align unequally displaced speakers.  
  Anyone who's solved this tough dog problem in a Westie or knows anyone 
I could call who has, please let me know.
  Thanks
