&gt; I had some fun this morning trying to rig my Polaris pool pump so
&gt; that it would help pump out the water from my sump.  After getting
&gt; everything hooked up right, I couldn't figure out a way to prime 
&gt; the pump which the Polaris must have. :(  I'm waiting for the traffic 
&gt; jams to dissapate before I go get a new pump.

Don't you have a spare Type I engine you can rig to a pump?
Hang in there!
