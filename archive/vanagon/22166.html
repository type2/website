Howdy,

A special thanks goes out to Joe Clark and Joel and whoever
else helped to write the &quot;Should you own a VW?&quot; and the 
&quot;VW Cult&quot; pages on Joe's homepage!  Recently my bus just wasn't
starting...absolutely nothing...and I was too busy to really 
get out there and mess with it (besides the fact that I'd be
fighting off 100 degree heat and fire ants in my gravel driveway
to fix it) so I sent it to the shop.  Well, after 2 months and
too much money, it still wasn't fixed.  I was getting so frustrated
that thoughts actually entered my mind about getting something
new (must have been the heat!) but luckily I ran across Joe's
page and it instantly cheered me up and led straight to the problem
...the solenoid...duhhhh!!!  Don't know why I didn't think of it, but
I went out this morning early...when it's only 90 or so...and took
the ol' hammer to the solenoid and it started right up!  Yaaayyy!!
Anyway, before I get too long winded...thanks for the pick me up
and the indirect advice!

BTW - I read about cheap Bentleys a couple of months ago...could
      someone send me the address of the place that had them.
      Also, Idiot books if possible!

Thanks.
Ken - '79 bus...with two months of cruising to make up for!
