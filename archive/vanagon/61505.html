&gt;Anyway, I once had a lovely bud vase (which was an option on the Type

&gt;still attractive) substitute for Happy?

I bought a pair of lovely 'modern' bud vases for Beethoven from Joe Gunyan
on Long Island, NY.  He produces cut crystal vases for approx $75 apiece.
They're very classy.

His number is/was (516) 221-4083.  If you get his address, send it to me.
I'd like to add him to my 'Vendors' list.
