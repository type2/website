Subject: 82 Vanagon L FS -cheap-

1982 Vanagon L 
7 passenger 
Cream over Yellow
brand new tires (250 miles)
front seats, middle 2-seater, and rear seat/foldout bed from an 87 Weekender

I bought this very recently from a fellow listmember, put on the new 
tires and upgraded the interior, and almost immediately after, something 
in the engine failed. Everything seems to be fine except that the 
compression in the right side is low, enough so that it won't start. The 
van was running well until this problem. I'm a student, and don't have 
the time or the resources or the know-how to fix it. I would love to get 
at least some of my money back on this deal gone bad, and will entertain 
any offers. Feel free to email me with any questions. The van is in 
Amherst, Mass.
