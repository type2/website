Hey, Sista!

I drove down to the site yesterday to re-aquaint myself with it. The 
place really is beautiful! I'm glad you all chose to come here - it's 
kinda like hosting a huge party in my own back yard. The fall colors 
should be going off when we're down there!

:-)

I met with the &quot;Hosts&quot; Ray and Gail LeMay (the volunteers who clean the 
restrooms) and they filled me in on the do's and don't's. I took some 
notes and came up with some ideas that might make setting up camp as 
hassle free as possible. I thought you'd like to see them. I sorta 
think that everybody would benefit by reading the following, but since 
you seem to have the best handle on group communications, I'll let you 
decide whether or not to forward it to the group. Hope that's OK with 
you.

The Feds who manage the area are old friends of mine (ex-bosses to be 
exact) and if they are around, and have the time, they will probably 
stop by to say hi. They are really nice people but they are committed 
to protecting the resource and will roust us if we're blowing it. So... 
it might be wise for everybody to know what's expected of them. It's 
really nothing to be concerned about - since they have weekends off and 
live up in town... so they won't be crusing through our site, hovering 
over or bugging us. The Hosts live across the street about a 1/4 mile 
and they're way old and won't have the energy to mess with us either. 
Things will be low profile, if we are low profile. I mean, ya know what 
I mean? Well, here is goes!

*************************************

PUMICE FLAT GROUP CAMPGROUND - Sites 1 - 4

2 miles south of Agnew Meadows on the road to the Devils Postpile Nat. 
Monument

CCC CENTRAL:

It might be nice to have a central location where our group can sit 
around the fire and have GREAT meals. Since SITE #4 accommodates the 
most people, we might consider using it as a place to hang, as a group, 
regardless of where we all sleep. All of these sites are located on 
about 2 acres and are within very short walking distance from each 
other. My suggestion is that those of us who want to camp as close to 
the center of things as possible should park at Site #4 - where there 
is enough room for 10 vehicles. The rest of us can park and camp in the 
other sites and walk in to Site #4 to hang with the group.  Just a 
thought. :-)

PARKING:	

All parking is limited to the areas left (east) of the dirt road. There 
is no parking allowed next to the tables or fire-rings at any of these 
sites. The closest parking to the fire-ring / tables area is in Site #4 
- which is another reason that it would be a good location for CCC 
Central.

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND PEOPLE:

The maximum number of vehicles allowed in each site is *serious* 
business here on the INYO - as is the maximum number of people who are 
allowed to occupy each site. (That's why we rented the WHOLE PLACE!) We 
should endeavor to stay within the limits stated below. The Campground 
Hosts, who are across the street a 1/4 mile, are friends of mine, as 
are the Feds who manage the area, but we shouldn't expect them to let 
us get away with over crowding and infringing on the regulations. 

TABLES:		

Each site has a number of picnic tables that seat up to 8 people. All 
of them are sturdy but weathered. Table cloths might be a real plus!!! 
We may move the tables from site to site, but they are WAY heavy.  See 
&quot;Site Descriptions&quot; for table locations as of 9/9/96.

RESTROOMS:	

2 restroom buildings
1 with 2 private rooms at Site # 1
1 with 4 private rooms between Sites # 3 and 4
No electrical outlets
NO FOOD TYPE TRASH ALLOWED IN RESTROOM TRASH CANS - PAPER ONLY!!!
NO PARKING ANYWHERE NEAR THE RESTROOMS!!!

WATER:		

Cold, but potable water is available at both restroom buildings.

BEAR PROOF FOOD STORAGE:

This is bear country!!! Food should NOT be left out - or the bears WILL 
GET IT! Ice chests and bags of food should be covered up and kept 
inside your closed vehicle unless you are eating it, or sitting right 
next to it!!!  We don't go anywhere without a gym teacher's whistle. 
Bears HATE the way it sounds and they will run away. These bears (Ursus 
americanus) don't want you - they want your food. Just pretend that 
you're camping in Yosemite... without the crowds! A clean campsite is a 
bearless campsite. If we have dogs, we probably won't have bears.

DOGS:

Dogs are welcome!!!  (woof)

But.... if the Feds show up, they will get all wiggly about dogs 
running wild. The rule on  *this*  Forest, is that if you are in a 
developed area (like our sites) dogs must be on a leash that is no 
longer than 6 feet long. If you are away from developed areas, dogs may 
run as wild as they please - as long as they are controllable by sight 
or sound. Since we are renting the whole place, the dog issue may only 
come up among ourselves, but if the Feds show up, be ready to produce a 
leash. Oh... and be ready to put Rover on it, as well.

HOOK-UPS:	

Whatareyakiddin' me? No hook - ups!!! (Sorry.)


BEAR PROOF DUMPSTERS: 	

There is one bear proof dumpster in the center of camp by sites 2 &amp;3. 
All trash should be dumpsterized or burned unless, of course, we want 
visitors of the bear kind. There is no parking anywhere near the 
dumpster!

ALUMINUM RECYCLE BIN:

This can is right next to the bear proof dumpster and it is for 
aluminum cans only!
