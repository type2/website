&lt;I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&lt;purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would

&lt;If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&lt;host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.

Here, here!!  I've been on the list less than two weeks and have already gotten 
answers and advice that's saved me AT LEAST $200 cash and several hours of 
aggravation.  If we can't rely on VW for help, all we have is each other (I 
know, sounds trite), so what's $3 a head for 24/7/365 advice?

Hell, I'll send Ron 10 bucks right now (need the snail-mail, Ron)....The Land 
Ark won't stay afloat w/out a knowledgeable crew!
