Subject: RE: re: RE: luggage rack / sunroof??

Matt Goike raises interesting ethical questions about the emissions of the
lawn-mower engine powered air conditioning.  I don't disagree with the
goal (green world for our children), but we could sure have some interesting
discussion about where the line should be drawn.  How many of the following
can we really justify?
. airconditioning in ANY car
. taking vacations in privately owned vehicles
. mowing lawns with gas powered tools
. more than Diesel Vanagon power in ANY car
. speed limits over 55; 45; 25; horsedrawn speed; walk speed
. eating more than 2000 calories a day
. taking vacations
. educating my child instead of feeding yours
. ad infinitum

Wherever the solution starts, I don't think that running a lawnmower engine
for a few hundred hours, in order to keep a much-loved VW bus from being
replaced by a newly-smelted Econobore, with air, is the problem.

Note not a flame, Matt -- I'm always eager to see how other people get
ethics and logic to fit together.
