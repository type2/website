Subject: Re: ?Installing A Syncro Transmission?

 
&gt;     Could you please give me some advice:
&gt;
&gt;    1 - Someone has said that there is an allignment required 
&gt;        to reinstall the drive shaft. I don't see this mentioned
&gt;        in the manual. Could you comment?
&gt;    
     I read in Bently that you had to do a reallignment anytime you removed
the driveshaft but it does not tell how. I asked around and nobody knew what
I was talking about until I happened to mention it to a German mechanic at
the dealership in Prince George(it seems that all the VW mechanics i meet in
Canada are German) when we were headed for Inuvik. He said all you have to
do is loosen the front diferential mounts so that if there is a bind or
stress put on the shaft by removing and replacing it it will be relived and
then you can tightened the diff. mounts up again. 



&gt;    2 - The starter had silicone sealed all over it. This had to be for
&gt;        water proofing. Did VW use silicone seal between the motor and
&gt;        the transmission also?  My engine has been changed. I found 
&gt;        vaccume lines going to the top of the clutch housing and 
&gt;        transmission case. I think these are to vent moisture? (cool). 
&gt;        What about the cutout (or drain )in the bottom of the engine, 
&gt;        in the clutch area. Is this sealed in a Syncro, somehow?  
&gt;    
&gt;   
&gt;  The only silicone I saw in mine was the starter, but I think the engine
had been out before I got there. Did I remember someone discussing the vent
tubes on the tranny? I think I heard these tubes just vented the Tranny and
put the vent opening up high so if you got into deep water your vent
wouldn't flood water into the box.            
&gt;
