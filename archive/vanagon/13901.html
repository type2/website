Subject:       Vanagon brake bleeding

Import Service, March 1995 Vol 8 No 3
Reader 'tech tip' submission:

&quot;If you have done some brake work on a VW Vanagon that requires you 
to bleed the system, you will find the master cylinder behind the 
instrument cluster.  Because of this fact, it is hard to get a power 
brake bleeder attached to the cylinder.

I have found that a screw on radiator cap fitting from a cooling 
system pressure testing outfit will fit the threads on the brake 
master cylinder reservoir.  Use the cap fitting to pressurize the 
brake system, then proceed to bleed the brakes solo.

Dan's Note:
Great idea here folks!  BUT make sure the cap you use is new or 
ABSOLUTELY dry as any residual moisture left from its cooling system 
application will be forced into the brake system.  I have a 'spare' 
bad cap that will work for this so i'll have to give it a try 
sometime.
