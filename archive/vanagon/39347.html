I finally got around to giving my '77 westy a compression test.  I took it 
off the road in December due to a steady loss of power (it was maxing out
at around 5 mph in the end).  The compression test read 110# for cylinders
1 and 2.  0# for cylinders 3 and 4.  I must say that a while back (in time
not miles) the previous owner had a shop give it a tune up where they got the
compression to go from approximately 0# in cylinders 3 and 4 to 50# with a 
valve adjustment.  Well back to my compression test.  After squirting oil in
the cylinders, there was no increase in compression.  I have some ideas of
what
is wrong, but I would like to have &quot;your&quot; expert opinions on what the trouble
probably is and what I should do to correct it.  
 I know very little about the history of this bus but it does have
a 2 liter FI engine (I think it is the original).

Thanks, 
Brett

PS.  When checking oil level I noticed what appears to be an incredibly fine
metal particles in it.  It sort of has a matallic glint to it.  I can feel no
grittyness in it though.  I don't remember seeing any metal on my last oil 
change only 700 miles ago.
What gives?

your engine........it's giving out.

this is rediculously low.  Compression should all be above 100, and within 15
from highest to lowest.  My 2 litre engine had 130-140 all round when it was
put in the bus used - this is higher than normal for a 1600.

check the oil with a magnet to see if the 'shavings' are steel.

 with bad rings the compression goes up when you squirt oil down the plug
hole.  evidently there is something else going on.

and yes, valves way out of adjustment will give you a nil compression
reading.

good luck
