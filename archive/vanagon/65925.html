Subject:        Syncro runs hot (Thermostat)

HI ALL,

Well after several major tries at lowering the temperature
in my Syncro, I have found yet, another very minor cause
that has added to the problem. The Thermostat. Thanks to
Dennis Haynes, he led me to check this and found a
difference between many after market thermostats and the
factory. The problem is the disc on the bottom. The after
market thermostats have a larger disc which does not allow
the thermostat to fully close off the bottom of the housing
and also does not allow the thing to open fully. The net
result is a temperature that will change very quickly. On
the highway the temp. would come down below the LED. Within
30 seconds after stopping, the temp. would be above the
light. I would believe that this is a problem isolated to
the Syncro only, because the housing is not the
sane as the Regular Vanagon. (cast Aluminum). Why it is
different I can only guess. After I installed a factor
thermostat the temp.  is now very stable, running just
above the LED. Still to hot for me, but one more problem
solved.
