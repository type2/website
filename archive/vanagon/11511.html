Subject: Seatbelts and Seats

Has anybody out there ever put retractable seatbelts into a bus (I've got a 
'77)?  I am incredibly sick of the non-retractable belts that came with the
van.  If you have ever done this job, please send me any tips/instructions
that would be helpful when installing the new seatbelts.  In particular,
what type of  seat belts will work (maybe out of a Vanagon?) and where
should I mount the components of the retractable seatbelts?

Also, does anybody know about how much a pair of good front seats for a '77
bus would cost.  Mine are very worn out and uncomfortable.  If you have any
that you would like to sell, e-mail me.  I live in minneapolis, Minnesota.

Thank you very much for any help you may have,
