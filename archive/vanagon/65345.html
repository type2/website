&gt; Subject: Radio suggestions???
&gt;
&gt; Having searched the archives religiously to no avail, I am
&gt; broadcasting this request for radio recommendations for a '84 Vanagon.

For my 85 Westy, I bought a Audiovox `package' deal through the Damark
catalog. Now, I don't usually buy from Damark because the quality varies
so much, but Audiovox is (in my opinion) middle of the road and the
price was right. I paid $300 for the head unit (AM/FM/Cass with
detachable faceplate) and 10 disc trunk-mount CD changer. It puts out
25watts per channel which is enough for me and the family.

Damark doesn't have the same brand/model in their latest catalog but
there is a comprable one for about $300 made by another company (I
forget the brand).

Good luck!  -Gregg
