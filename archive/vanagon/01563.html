To the tune of &quot;John Brown's Body&quot;, also the same tune as
&quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;:

&quot;The Parts Go Rollin On&quot;

My old Volkswagen lies a-rustin in the field,
My old Volkswagen lies a-rustin in the field,
My old Volkswagen lies a-rustin in the field,
But its parts go rollin on.

Glory glory hallelujah,
Glory glory hallelujah,
Glory glory hallelujah,
Its parts go rollin on.

My old Volkswagen came a-grindin to the ground,
It just wouldn't go no further, it had wound completely down;
But I took off all the parts I could and sold them all around,
And the parts go rollin on.

Glory glory hallelujah,
Glory glory hallelujah,
Glory glory hallelujah,
Its parts go rollin on.

Well, I've always been a poor man and the workin life's a bitch,
And it's always been another day and dig another ditch,
But the prices that those parts have brought, Oh Joy, have made me rich,
And the parts go rollin on.

Glory glory hallelujah,
Glory glory hallelujah,
Glory glory hallelujah,
Its parts go rollin on.

My old Volkswagen lies a-rustin in the field,
My old Volkswagen lies a-rustin in the field,
My old Volkswagen lies a-rustin in the field,
But its parts go rollin on.

Glory glory hallelujah,
Glory glory hallelujah,
Glory glory hallelujah,
Its parts go rollin on.
