     Fellow Vanagoners:

     I have received many comments about my nasty e-mail id. These have
     ranged from sarcastic &quot;Like, you picked it out yourself,right?&quot; to
     downright mean &quot;Your e-mail id is ugly, and your gateway dresses you
     funny&quot;.

     I have been thinking to myself, &quot;How can I get a better looking e-mail
     id?&quot;. Well, I have figured out the solution. Since the e-mail id is
     tied to my employer, the easiest way to change it would be to get a
     new employer. One who has cooler id's!

     So I quit my job. *Just* to get a better looking id.

     Happy? I sure hope so!

     Anyways-the real scoop. I quit for a better reason. (E-mail me
     personally if you just *have* to know why!)

     So, I must unsubscribe for the list for a few days whilst I learn my
     new E-mail address. I will be keeping up with the posts on Skip's WWW
     server, though (THANKS SKIP!!!!). If you need to send messages to me,
     please send them to my Compuserve Address. Thanks!
