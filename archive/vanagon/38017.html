Subject: Re: One-piece exhaust for '78 Transporter?


Hi all

Thanks for all the great responses to my question about one-piece
exhaust replacements.  From everybody's experience, looks like I'm
going to:

- get the 1-piece exhaust from JC Whitney for my Transporter
- give it a good cleaning
- paint it with Rust-o-leum barbeque paint
- install it
- save the original exhaust that I'll be taking off, and see if I can't
  do any repairs on it to make it whole again.  I'll post again in a couple
  of weeks when this all comes to pass, to let you all know how it came out.

&gt;Hi all
&gt;
&gt;I was noticing the other day in a JC Whitney catalog, that there is a
&gt;one-piece exhaust system that can be installed in place of my several-
&gt;piece exhaust system on my '78 Transporter.  It handles everything rear
&gt;of the heat exchangers.
&gt;
&gt;I need to replace most of the equipment rear of my heat exchangers, so
&gt;I was wondering if anyone has had any relevant experience of this or
similar
&gt;setups, or if I should go the (many) extra bucks and more time for a
&gt;complete replacement of all the original parts.
