&gt;&gt;Bradley:
&gt;&gt;I just bought some 'Westphalian Pumpernickle' bread.  :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Rusty:
&gt;Did you have to work on it before you could eat it or was it warmed up,
&gt;adjusted, and ready &quot;to roll.&quot;?

Maher:
Hey, I heard it was in good condition!

But it sags, and seeds keep falling off. And the bakery charges huge
amounts for new seeds, and won't pay for them even though they made
the bread.

TGIF.
