&gt; Where is the switch for the OXS light on an '87? Also does anyone know of a
&gt; good source for seat covers including the center jump seats? I have been
&gt; talking to Jim at Busboys  and he keeps promising to send some info and
&gt; fabric samples but I haven't seen anything yet and it has been almost two
&gt; months.
