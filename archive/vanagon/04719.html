OK, I'll throw my hat into the ring.
	Last year, I was on my way to go surfing in my freshly painted '67 kombi,
I'm flying along about 70 or so and I start smelling how rubber.  Hmm.  Is 
that me?  Nah.

	It gets worse, so I'm thinking may its me, so I manouver all the way
o'er to the right laner, and just as I'm pulling into the wight station at 
Suisun City... BLAMMMO!  Front left tire gives up the ghost.  

	Well, I didn't have any problem with lug-nuts, but I did have a problem
with the spare being flat as a window.  Ended up limping back to Fairfield
and paying too much for a new tire.

	BTW - got the tire on the 911 fixed today.  there were three different
pieces of metal embedded in it!
