Subject: [F] You might be a list member if ....

when you see an mint '88 synchro for $1000, your first reaction is to post
rather than to buy;

you would rather debate the merits of Michelin XZX's vs. Nokia Hakapalita's
rather than replace your bald tires;

you seriously considered installing this engine:

     -Tatra, 3500cc V8 aircooled, mounted in rear, Czechoslowakia, in Germany
     conversion adaptors available for installation of this motor in VWs, the
     motor itself is available from Tatra factory for about US$ 2500

in your spittie;  (BTW, Brian, Please post more info on this)

the curtains in your house are brown, white &amp; orange;

you have ever considered moving to Alabama, just to be closer to the font of
all knowledge.

the only jokes you receive are through e-mail.


                            Because you can never have enuf Friday humor,
                            Steve Dolan
