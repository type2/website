&gt; Braking to turn left was like having power steering:-)  Turning right was

Sounds familiar!! I have a chronic oil leak myself, or actually my bus does!!
The pulling whilr braking is most likely caused by brake pad 
contamination, if it be brake fluid or grease or other fluid. Check for 
leaking wheel cylinders then replace the pads!! I wish i had a 66 bus!!
