Subject: Help:87 syncro running bad


I am the consequential owner of a 1987 Vanogon Syncro.  I need help with an
electrical/ignition problem that won't go away for more than three months at
a time.  My van acts like there is water in the fuel and runs very rich and
coughs black smoke.  Power loss is evident and the idle is very rough.  Every
once in a while it runs wonderfully as if a mechanic were standing right
there.  Other times the power loss episodes are erratic and random.  When it
is acting up pressing the accellerator to the floor clears it up with a jolt
of power and accelleration... let up on the gas and it starts jerking and
coughing again.  It has new heads; alternator; waterpump; CPU; plugs; wires;
cap/rotor; air filter; etc....   Help me!!!!
My name is Neal Helfman and my e-mail address is;

If you know of anyone who specializes in Vanogon electronic fuel injection
please give them my name!!!!  I have $$$$$ to spend for the correct
diagnosis!!!   Thankyou 

     Neal,
       First where are you located...If you are in PGH. PA
       I will fix it at no cost for labor, you supply parts.
       Second don't ever offer $$$$$$ to fix any such small problem!
       reguardless it will end up costing you $$$$$!

       I had a very similar problem that the dealer could not fix!
       It was the middle of the winter and I didn't have a place out
       of the snow to work on it. So I thought a VWoA dealer was the 
       best thing. Man was I wrong. They wanted to put a computer in.
       6 weeks later after the snow was melting I fix it by replacing
       a wire. I simply traced out every wire in the engine compartment
       from the computer to the engine. Found the temperature sensor
       not making a connection. Pulled on the wire right there in the
       engine compartment where the engine rocks and found the break.
       I then replaced the entire wire to the computer. I haven't has 
       that problem since.
    
       Your symptoms sound just like mine. The only other thing I 
       know of that will can cause these symptoms is the O2 sensor. To
       check this just disconnect the single wire plug. This is a good 
       temperary check. Or a temerary fix to get you home.

                 let us know what you find
