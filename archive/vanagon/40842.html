Cross-posted from another list. The example given is for a Toyota Land
Cruiser but I thought the information was useful regardless:

&gt;Subject: Grease--what it is, types to use in LCs
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Subject: Grease types (chassis, u-joint, blue vs black)
&gt;,
&gt;&gt;Would someone know the difference between molybedenum disulfide lithium
&gt;&gt;base chassis grease (NLGI no. 2) and lithium base wheel bearing grease
&gt;&gt;(NLGI no. 2)?
&gt;&gt;The first is recomended for the steering knuckles on my 85 FJ60 and the
&gt;&gt;second is for the U-joints.
&gt;&gt;Second question is:  Does Toyota use a blue colored grease for any
&gt;&gt;reason?  The grease in the steering knockles looks blue but the grease of
&gt;&gt;the recomended type at the auto store is black.  Any problem with mixing
&gt;&gt;these?  Do I need to buy Toyota grease for this rig?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks,
&gt;&gt;Rocky
&gt;
&gt;First of all we need to know what grease is:
&gt;        Grease is a lubricant. It is produced by combining lubricating oil,
&gt;additives (eg Molybdenum Disulfide), and a soap.
&gt;
&gt;        The lubricant in most greases is a (petroleum based) mineral oil,
&gt;although some greases use synthetic lubricants. The soap emulsifies the
&gt;lubricating portion and thickens it. The type of soap used in making the
&gt;grease is one way in which greases are classified. For example, a lithium
&gt;soap is used in a &quot;lithium grease&quot;. The actual lithium soap is properly
&gt;known as 12-Hydroxystearate, other greases will use other types of soaps,
&gt;for example, Aluminum.
&gt;
&gt;        Greases made with different types of soaps will usually be
&gt;incompatible and cause the grease to liquify or fail in some other way.
&gt;Liquified grease will not adhere to the intended surfaces and the result
&gt;will be that the parts will not be sufficiently lubricated and fail as a
&gt;result. Other grease failure problems can be related to contamination
&gt;(water, dirt, oil etc...), infrequent changes, overheating, mechanical
&gt;shear and other forces.
&gt;
&gt;        There are many additives that can be put into grease to give each
&gt;type of grease unique properties. This also make some greases much more
&gt;suited certain types of jobs than others. Some of these additives may be
&gt;colourants, corrosion inhibiters, helping the grease resist shear forces,
&gt;make it more tenaceous, help it resist water contamination etc...etc...
&gt;
&gt;        Molybdenum Disulfide (aka &quot;Moly&quot;) helps the grease film carry a
&gt;load and is most often a grey to grey-black in colour. Other greases, such
&gt;as wheel bearing grease, may be green, blue, yellow, red, white, or another
&gt;colour depending on the colour of the lubricating portion or the colourant
&gt;used. Colours can help to identify what type of grease has been used but
&gt;are widely variable and, as such, are not a reliable indicator.
&gt;
&gt;        A few more grease notes: NLGI stands for the National Lubricating
&gt;Grease Institute, they are a body that sets standards for greases. The
&gt;viscosity of grease, as labeled by NLGI, ranges from No. 000 (runny) to No.
&gt;6 (very thick, almost solid). The viscosity is quite important to the
&gt;application so use the right one.
&gt;
&gt;        Anyways to get back to the question at hand... No not all greases
&gt;are compatible. If you don't know what type is there, then replace it with
&gt;the correct (and known) type of grease as specified by your owners/service
&gt;manual. Make sure you use the right viscosity. The grease may say it's a
&gt;Moly grease but give no viscosity--find out what it is before using it.
&gt;Moly adds shear resistance in low speed applications (speed of moving parts
&gt;being relative to each other), use non-moly grease in wheel bearings as the
&gt;relative speeds of the parts is high. The colour is not always relevant,
&gt;the fact that there is blue grease in your knuckles may mean that there is
&gt;a non-moly grease in there (as I personally have never seen Moly grease in
&gt;any other colour except grey-black). The colour of Moly grease is, I
&gt;believe, related to the Moly itself--changing the blue stuff for the
&gt;correct grease would be a good move when you can find the time to do it.
&gt;Also, try checking with the shop that last did the service on your LC to
&gt;find out what type of grease was used.
