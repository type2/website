Subject: coolant leak worse

The injector temp sender seems to have stopped leaking, but the coolant
expansion tank has lost it (as Joel predicted).  I've ordered parts...

I ordered my brake parts as well.  Inspection showed that I really did need
new rotors and I threw in new drums as well (haven't seen the existing
ones, but they ARE 102k miles old).  Got great prices from APEC, a Houston
foreign car (quasi)wholesaler.  $49 for the rotors.

Haven't worked on a bus newer than a '72 before - this should prove
interesting...

(And my guru resold some of the Autobahn coolant to me for just under $7 a
gallon :-)
