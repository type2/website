Hello Everyone
     I finaly went to Radio Shack and got the number for the instrument
lights.  It is a micro miniature type with two wires at the base.  You have
to disassemble the VW lamp.  Pull up on the two metal tabs that form the
connection on the plastic base.  The bulb is soldered to these.  The lamp
should pull out with the pins. Use the old lamp as a guide to determine the
length of the new wires,then cut the wires on the metal tabs to seperate the
lamp and tabs.  Solder the new lamp to the metal tabs, be careful not to put
much solder on the tabs.  Too much solder makes it almost impossble to
reassemble the lamp.  Carefully insert the tabs back into the plastic base.
This works for the lamps on the tach, and Differental lock lights.  It may
not work on all instrument panel lights.
     The part number from Radio Shack is 272-1092, some stores might not
have them in stock but they can get them.  
Happy trails

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
