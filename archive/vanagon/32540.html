        Hmmm.... let's let that one go ;-).


&gt;I hate chains.  Really suck when the roads are half plowed dry and half
&gt;barely plowed.

     I agree. But if a surface is plowed, dry or wet, I've discovered I
     don't need them. There are three places where I do want chains: on
     ice, in  mud, and in deep unplowed snow.


     Also, an ABS afterthought: You (I) can't have ABS *and* differential
     lock(s) working at the same time. They have the opposite effects.

     Diff locks keep wheels (front or rear) turning at the same rate, so
     that the differentials do not send all power to the side without
     traction. ABS reduces braking to specific wheels loosing traction,
     encouraging the wheels to turn at different rates.

     On my Audi, when you manually engage the diff lock, the ABS is
     automatically disengaged, and an &quot;ABS OFF&quot;
     annuciator on the dash is illuminated.

     Maybe I just want some bright red Porsche calipers peeking out from
     behind my wheels...:-).
