&gt; One was in the Washington Post this weekend for sale, asking 
&gt; $37,500, so they are not all in Missouri. 
&gt; 
&gt; Come to think it of we passed one inbound on Interstate 66 after the
&gt; last mid-atlantic campout. We even waved; all we got back was a 
&gt; grumpy look.
&gt; 
There's been at least one on the local VW lot for a while here 
(Victoria). Still never seen one on the road though...
