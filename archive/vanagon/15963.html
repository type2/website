Subject: Re: Vanagon Head Gaskets

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;anybody know for sure if the bmw's and audi's and mercedes and saab's and
&gt;&gt;volvo's have had this same rash of gasket problems?? i only know that Mercedes
&gt;&gt;was very very very strongly against using anything but their own phosphate-
&gt;&gt;free coolant (properly co$tly, thank you very much!). overly caustious?
&gt;&gt;they also felt the same way about all replacement parts. it's a wonder they
&gt;&gt;didn't have their own brand of gasoline! ;)

My volvo 264 is a 6 cylinder wasserbox engine too. The head/block is all
aluminum like vanagon except it's a V6. The volvo engine uses a more
conventional head gasket but with an aluminum rim at the top of each
cylinder. This rim is very thick, as thick as the thickness of a conventional
head gasket. It is about 2 to 3 mm wide. I think it is not likely to have
the kind of problem vangon's gasket is suffering. The head is torgued
to about 70 to 80 ft-lbs.
