&gt; and theat the 2 rear wheels were very hot as well. I limped home, hoping
&gt; the pressure would abate. However, yesterday, I tried to drive across
&gt; town, and found the brakes to be super-tight, and still dragging.

Oye!  I had this very problem!  It almost killed me 3 4 times! (duh....)

I drove over a thousand miles with it like this!  

Anyway, there's a couple of thing to look at.

My problem was in several parts:

1) I had some rust and crud in my brake lines
2) I had 2 restricted brake flex lines (you fixed yours)
3) The master cylinder (Brazilian) albeit new, was not working properly.

I would disassemble the whole mess, piece by piece, and start over, making
sure each piece works before going on to the next.

Sure, I can say that as I'm snuggly warm and dry next to my computer...

BTW - Whats so dangerous about it?  What will happen is you will run out
of brake shoe, and the wheel cylinder piston's travel will exceed the
length of the bore - it pops out, and you have catastrophic pressure loss
RatBoy Johnson watched this happen to me, and it wasn't pretty!
