Subject:  Drop Engine to Replace Rubber Components to Gas Tank

I have talked with a couple of subscribers and a couple of mechanics
regarding the gas fumes I have been experiencing.  I am in the process
of pulling and replacing all of my fuel lines and my fuel filter just so they
are in good shape.  I would like to correct the smell problem which I do
believe has something to do with the boot/flange/seal to the filler tube
and also the curved rubber that connects to tank itself.  I would prefer
not to cut any holes in my bus.  Does the engine need to be dropped to
get at this area?  I would not like to do this with the little time that I have
and camping season upon us.  I have read that you can remove the gas
tank compartment lid but is a bitch without removing the engine.  If I can
remove this can I replace the rubber tube that connects to the gas tank
and replace the rubber connector at the top?  If I can't do these things
would it be feasible for me to keep being careful by not completely filling
the tank up above half a tank.  Not great for long trips but its a cheap
solution.  Also, a mechaic mentioned I would be able to tell what kind of
shape my tank is in be checking my old fuel filter.  I will be doing all my
replacing this weekend because I'm waiting to recieve some parts from
RMMW's.  Once again thanks for all the help and if any of you are going
to the Further Festival June 26th at Nissan Pavallion let me know and we
could get together.
