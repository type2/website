Subject: Re: 87 Syncro Blown CV Joint

hi-

do a search on the web for CV joints and/or drive shafts.  there was a
place I stunmbled accross awhile ago that does mail order exchange for
rebuilt shafts.  never used 'em, but that was all they did, so they're
probably pretty good.  if you don't have web access, let em know and I
could look for you (didn't save the link)

&gt;Hello-
&gt;
&gt;Well my worst fears were realized when I tried to remove my from left axle
&gt;shaft.  The cage for the outer driver side CV joint is cracked.  I called at
&gt;least 30 parts places this morning and found only 2 that had the joint.  One
&gt;price $450.00 and the other $250.00 and in stock.  Local VW dealer $275.00
&gt;and $85.00 core charge.  I've been told that it is cheaper to buy a rebuilt
&gt;half shaft complete with both CV's, but no one around here has one.  I did
&gt;find several people that were willing to rebuild mine, but i got a little
&gt;concerned when they indicated that they had never heard of a syncro.  One
&gt;parts place said they could get the entire assembly for $100.00.  Come to
&gt;find out it was a rebuilt unit for the rear not front.
&gt;
&gt;My question is - does anyone know of a place where I can purchase the entire
&gt;rebuilt shaft.  A new shaft from VW is $1,100.00.  The second is - I am
&gt;having some trouble removing the joint from the shaft even though the circlip
&gt;has been removed.  Is the shaft toasted?? or does the joint need to be
&gt;pressed off??
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the help
&gt;
