I am willing to help or TRY to provide the coordination effort for an East 
Coast Adventure!

So far, in several queries, I've not sensed a &quot;serious' interest.

I've not been an organizer in the perspective before so if someone will 
sign-in and guide me, I'll attempt to do as much of the work as possible.

Of course there MUST be those who are willing to participate and will stay 
on through the planning and until the event happens.
