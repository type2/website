Subject: Re: Skeleton Driving a Purple Bus) was: great t-shirt offer

Got the t_shirt last night and I can yes they are TRULY fabulous.  Only
problem is keeping the spouse from stealing and shrinking it so it will no
longer fit me.  Yes I know I could get one for her but this is a little game
we play around my house and if we both had one it wouldn't give us as much
to play with.  However in this case the game could get serious so I'll
probably be ordering another one soon if there 
are any left.  

This is truly a cool t_shirt.  

T.S.
