Posting this to see if anyone wants to go. I'm leaving on Friday if I can
find a place to camp. I live in Akron if anyone wants to caravan. Should be
fun, I met some of these guys in Columbus last year and they're a great
club. 

 May 18 (Sat), Auburn Hills, MI - Michigan Vintage VW Show; This pomises
to be great at VWoA headquarters. Show for vehicles up to `79. Stateline
Volksfolks sponsoring a caravan. Bob Case (810)553-2586
