Subject: RE: Head Help!

        Chuck:
        
        Try GEX in California.  I don't have their 800 number handy.  Try 
        1-800-555-1212 for 800 information.  They sell heads but have had 
        a hefty price increase lately.  Call them and see.  My best luck 
        has been finding heads in junk yards and having them rehabed in a 
        local shop called Dover Cylinder Heads.  One of the heads in my 
        72 Westy cracked about 2 weeks ago; I plan to replace both of 
        them and this has worked for me.
