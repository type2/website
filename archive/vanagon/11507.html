Subject: Upper Bed Removal?

We never use the upper bed in our '86 Westy (we are getting to old for 
the acrobatics required) and were thinking of taking it out and making 
the space available for some storage. The hinge seems easy to remove, but 
got to wondering if the metal bar might be counted on for some structural 
strength. 
Does anyone know for sure if we can take that out without worries?
BTW, it looks like we could get over 3 ft3 of storage in that space. 
Probably soft stuff - clothes, bedding, towels, etc.

Thanks - Jack
