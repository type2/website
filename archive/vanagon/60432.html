Subject: Eorovan Door latch stuck!!!

EMERGENCY! I have a 93 EV with a STUCK driver's side door latch! When
the door is opened, the catch releases from the first (closer to the
inside of the car) post, but then gets stuck on the second (safety) post
mounted on the jam. The catch, which is part of the door latch
mechanism, mount inside the door, cannot rotate all the way to free
itself from the second post. Something hard is blocking it, and is
inaccessible. The only thing that can be removed without cutiing wieth
the door panel or door skin is the handle, which gives virtually no
access to the latck mechanism. ANYBODY HAVE ANY IDEAS! I will attempt to
get VOA involved, as this is already a costly deal ($90 of dealer
&quot;diagnostic&quot;) time. Rob Greene
