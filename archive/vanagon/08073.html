So lytle_at_noao_dot_edu says:
&gt; from getting too warm.  I noticed that the air from the heater had a
&gt; slight oily smell to it but I have come to expect that from air-cooled
&gt; engines.

I'd check out the source of this oil smell.  You don't want to be breathing
this stuff even oil for too long.  Not good for the lungs.

&gt; 
&gt; P.S.  I took a few photographs and will scan 'em in for my WWW page when I
&gt;       get the film developed.
&gt; 

Enjoyed the trip report and will be looking forward to the photos.  Maybe
someday I'll get a chance to scan some of my own.

Hastie bananas,

Steven
