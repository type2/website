Subject: Thanks to all!!


Thanks to all of you for you information and suggestions! 
Since I have started reading the list my '81 Westy has 
dropped a valve seat :-( But thanks to your help, I have 
ordered a rebuilt engine from AVP in California. These folks
Specialize in Vanagon engines, as well as install them. They
really seem to know their stuff. Hopefully we will get it 
into the van next weekend. Can't wait to see how she 
performs with a NEW engine. Will I get up hills now? Can I 
stop being a rolling roadblock on 2 lane hiways? Will keep 
you posted with results.
Lisa
