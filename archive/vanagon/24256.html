&gt; to believe its some sort of &quot;capacity designator&quot; or model #; ie maybe 
&gt; there is a 2.0 or 2.5 model, just for argument.  The 28 FDR is pressed in
&gt; the cover, looks like part of the pressing itself.

Here's a response from a non-subscribing friend of mine:
-------------------------------
To whom and all it may concern:
	The 1.5 designation of the governor was the engine size in liters.
	These governors were installed on some (not all) buses in 
1964-1966. The governor kept the engines from &quot;overrteving&quot; as VW put it. 
There was concern at the time that the larger engine would ovewr rev and 
blow. Thus, the governor.
	I once had about a dozen of these. I would always take them off 
bus engines and file them in the trash. If the owner wanted to keep the 
vehicle &quot;stock,&quot; there is a way to gut them. I also did that.
	$75? I'm heading to the landfill in Laramie, WY. I put about 30 
of them there!
