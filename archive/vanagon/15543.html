&gt;But I wonder if over the next two years as the internet explodes 5x yet

&gt;(50-50%?) will still continue. There are a *lot* of 'dem pesky busses out
&gt;there.

but in two years time, EVERYBODY will have their own home pages and internet
access will be piped into every home with cable tv, and there will be a
mailing list for each and every bus year and model, so it won't matter. :)

i pity the poor beetle folks, though. ;)
