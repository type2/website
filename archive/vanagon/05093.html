Subject: My first experiance with a vw *&amp;^%_at_ gas gauge!!!

I bought a van that needed a motor, and on my first drive in it, it 
wouldn't start once I shut it off.  I had it towed into the place I had 
just had over 3000$ work done.  A day later they had replaced the 
solenoid and said it was fine.  Two days after that I couldn't start it 
again.  This time I called the shop and put on my best irate customer act 
(it was easy) and had THEM tow it in at their expense.  Same problem, the 
solenoid was fried.  The also found the problem that was causing it.  The 
ignition switch was binding. When I would turn the key, it wouldn't 
return to the &quot;off&quot; position.  Well great, now I thought I was set for 
my maiden voyage! It was Friday, and I was running around getting 
supplies when the bus crapped out on the freeway.  I figured that the 
bozo's at the shop missed something again!  I did the pissed off customer 
thing again, and they towed it in.  I went along to &quot;supervise&quot; the 
troubleshooting this time.  
	Well, they went straight to the starter system with a voltmeter.  
After finding everything checked out, one of the guys asked me how much 
gas I have.  Given the mood I was in, and my typically smart mouthed 
attitude I said &quot;None, it's diesel and there is a quarter of a tank. 
Hmmmph.&quot;  We went over to verify this fact.  The needle was just barely 
on the red portion, and of course the tank was as dry as the Sahara.  
What I got then was a humiliating lesson on how to read a gas gauge.

BTW  when ever it gets below 1/2 tank, it becomes very unreliable, as it 
will &quot;float&quot; from empty to half full with the slightest bump/incline.    

                          
                               Later,
                                    Brad
