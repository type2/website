&gt;Houston, you say?   Hmmm, I wonder if he'd trade his alloys for my
&gt;lovely ABS plastic wheel covers.....already got all the other stuff,
&gt;well, ok, maybe not the Westy bit... ;^)

I'm sure he'd like to get rid of those awful alloys, they being the
maintenance nightmere that they are.  He might even throw in a few Westy bits
to get those lovely plastic &quot;Aero-style&quot; wheel covers of yours.
