Subject:      Re: Recommendation for Vanagon Mechanic or Shop in Seattle Area

&gt; I recently bought a 1986 Vanagon Westalia and would like to find a good
&gt; shop for servicing, repairs, etc.. in the Seattle area.  Would you please
&gt; email me your recommendations (and shops to avoid).  If there is a good
&gt; response, I will compile them and resend the compilation.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks - Chris Maier

I've been primarily using Carter VW, 5202 Leary Avenue, NW, 206-782-7474
and have been quite pleased with their competence and overall service.
Pricey, though, especially since they're locked into 'genuine VW' parts.
Provides free loaner cars.

Campbell-Nelson (another dealer shop) is also good, and does offer
aftermarket parts in some cases.  Flat rate labor costs vary, +/- 20%
from Carter.

As for independents, Louis Foreign Auto, 7310 Roosevelt Way NE,
206-524-3366 has received lots of favorable comments.  Cheaper than
either dealer, though the savings vary quite a bit depending on the
repair.  Does not currently have all the VW diagnostic equipment, so may
not be able to handle some repairs.
