Subject: Re: Bergman Trouble

&gt;&gt;Ok, so here's the situation.  Three weeks ago I call up Bergmann and order a
&gt;&gt;new AS21 case, hyd lifters, full flow and cut for 90.5's.  Finally,
&gt;yesterday
&gt;&gt;my case arrives at home.  Unfortunately, I'm here in NY 3 1/2 hours away.
&gt; So
&gt;&gt;tonight I ask my parents to look at the stuff that came and make sure it's
&gt;&gt;all there.  While on the phone, my dad was looking at the case.  He's
&gt;reading
&gt;&gt;the numbers off it and it turns out to be an AS41!!!!!  Now I am really
&gt;&gt;confused.  I never knew that these cases were around (new) anymore nevermind
&gt;&gt;someone trying to sell them.  I am really pissed.  Does anyone know where
&gt;&gt;these cases are from?????  Any chance they are just mis marked AS21's???  (I
&gt;&gt;thought I heard about this before)  I am prepared to do battle with bergmann
&gt;&gt;tommorow!!  Any help/suggestions appreciated.  The case was marked as shown
&gt;&gt;below and at least appeared new.


Hmmmm... I posted Mofoco's sale price ($260) for a new brazilian case a week
ago.  I just checked the catalog again and their case is also AS41 alloy.
So is this old stock and are companies (like RMMW) that charge $375-$400 for
a new case selling the new AS21s?  If buying the AS21 case is so expensive
is it more cost effective to have a reputable shop recondition your old AS41
case and accept a shorter life span?  If you're not building a &quot;performance&quot;
engine is the new AS41 case sufficient?
