Subject: Vanagon Alignments

Volks,
Is it recommended to do a 4 wheel alignment or is a 2 wheel alignment
satisfactory in most conditions? It only costs $10 more for a 4 wheel
align and therefore I wonder if a mechanic can do -anything- for $10
(US). In other words, as a matter of course would anything on the rear
axels be touched for the extra $10?
Thanks for feedback
Regards
