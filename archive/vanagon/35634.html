So Mark &amp; Kath says:
&gt; 
&gt; Mid-life crisis? How rude! Why is it... that... just when you figure 
&gt; out that it's OK to do something that pleases you, and you just so 
&gt; happen to be 46... that some people think you're going through some 
&gt; sort of crisis? I believe that creating &quot;Her Majesty&quot; was a 
&gt; celebration... not a crisis!

You got that right Kath.  What else are we suppose to do?  Sit around
and watch everyone else find their dreams while we watch it on TV?
