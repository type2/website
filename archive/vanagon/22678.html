&gt;Drove the 14 hours to get there without problem, drove around for a while,
&gt;registered at a campground, got in the bus, turned the key, hears a clunk,
&gt;then nothing...just a relay under the dash going click.
&gt;
&gt;Dealer says (before looking at it) that it might be:
&gt;
&gt;a) starter motor
&gt;b) electrical problem
&gt;c) siezed engine (ouch)

Sounds like a poor earth on the battery. The clicking is the X relay that 
cuts out the lights and stuff while you start the engine. It clicks on and 
off rapidly when the current to the starter is too much for the battery 
connections. Its definitely not (c) and probably not (a), although it could 
possibly be a duff solenoid, so don't let the dealer try and rip you off.
