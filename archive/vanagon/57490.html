Subject: Heat exchanger flapper

One more unexpected problem, I went out today to drain the excess oil from my
81 Westy.  I was trying to track down all of the oil leaks, when I suddenly
notice why my heat hadn't felt quite as warm as it had before.  The left
flapper(if you are looking at the engine from the back of the van) that
connects the flexible duct to the heat exchanger was gone, missing, completly
dis-de*#_at_! appeared.  It seems strange that it would have fallen off, but, I
also find it hard to believe that it was stolen, however, I did leave it up
on ramps overnight.  But anyway, does anyone have this have one of these I
could buy used.  If not, do any of you know where I could get a good price on
one, or maybe one of you know of some shmuck who leaves his van up on ramps
overnight, in which case I could just help myself. Just kidding about the
last part.  Thanks in advance for any responses.  Oh ye if anyone has that
part #handy I would appreciate it if you could send it my way.  Thanks again
