&lt;&lt; I know it's not original VW glass, but today I'm having a new front
 windshield installed for $145 on the '85 rustfalia. That includes removing
 the old cracked windshield, installing the new one and the price of the
 windshield! I bought a new seal from Kyle Wade at Volksmotorsports for
 $40!!!
