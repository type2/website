Hope you are all well,

There were all kinds of VW's in Bar harbor this weekend.  The best was a
spotless '72 Westy from Quebec...it was so intact that we sighed over those
chrome outside mirrors; they weren't even pitted! All kinds of Vanagons
passed by with bikes on the roof and hanging to the rear.  Maybe bicycling
is funner than I thought?

The real prize for us was to meet three other EVC's around Black Woods Camp
in Acadia and to be hailed by a VW sales person from Worcester, MA asking,
&quot;What is this van you have?&quot;  Maybe the word on them will be released by,
uh, maybe VW?

Tranny questions for EVC owners.  Can I shift this transmission all the time
like a standard to use in braking?  I know that first gear is really
extreme, but is there any reason to think I'm abusing the trasmission by
dropping down to third or second at speeds of 45 for third and 25 for  second?

The colors of fall were just hints this weekend...red and yellow was just an
accent still surrounded with greens.  Wait for a few weeks still.

Wish you were here,
Gary
