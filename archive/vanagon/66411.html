&lt;&lt; What are these wheels worth? Well, the dealer wants around $400 each,
 soooo....If you ask, say $250 each that would be a fair price, but you
 probably won't sell them too fast. On the other hand, if you asked 50
 bucks like someone did, they would sell faster than you could post your
 offer to the list!!!
  &gt;&gt;

Actually, there is a &quot;norm&quot; set for these wheels used.
4 Carat Alloys with ctr caps, and all lug nuts/bolts mounted on tires usually
go for $400-500 for all 4.
(usually between 100/150 apiece)
this is the &quot;norm&quot; as this is what I sold my set for, ($450 for all 4
complete w/ caps/lugs &amp; mounted on tires) and this is what I've seen other
sets going used at swap meets. (seen 3 sets this year, differen sellers, and
all the $400-$500 for 4 complete range)  Most everybody prices them the same.

Then again, this is the east coast.  (I already know how blown out of
porportion west coast prices are)
