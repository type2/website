     Maureen-
     
     Congrats on your find.   In May, I traveled all the way to GA/SC to 
     buy my '91 Westfalia.  I share your glee.
     
     Actually, if it isn't required to wave, it should be!  Having driven a 
     &quot;splittie&quot; for 10 years, I got used to waving and/or flashing the 
     headlights at every other &quot;splittie&quot; I saw; often, the other driver 
     would beat me to it.
     
     Years ago, I had a '71 Westfalia - same phenomenon.
     
     There's a tendency for Westfalia owners, no matter what the vintage of 
     their vehicle, to flash and/or wave at one another.
     
     Keep doing it.  It's the &quot;secret handshake&quot; of our ken.
     
     BTW, do Acura owners flash and wave at each other?  I rest my case.
