Subject: R.I.P. 79(80) Bug Convertible

I know that this is the Typ2 list, however please bear with me on this...

January 7, 1980 - February 17, 1995


It is with much sadness that I announce the death of our recently
purchased Bug Convertible which was totaled out when struck by
a delivery truck travelling in the breakdown lane while the
driver was asleep.

My wife was driving HER convertible when it developed engine trouble,
she promptly pulled to the far side of the break-down lane on the
interstate, checked to see if there was anything she could
do to fix the problem...then got a ride to the dealer's so they
could go out and fetch the car.

About two to five minutes after she left, the truck hit the bug..
dead center in the back...shattering the brand new factory rebuilt
motor as well as the transmission...forced the car into a gully
at which time the truck rode over the top of the bug and
caused the bug to roll over twice before both bug and truck
came to rest in the trees on the upside of the gully.

Fortunately, my wife was not in the car....otherwise I would
be preparing an obituary of a different type. Our two-year-old
Alex is very upset his &quot;New Bug&quot; as he called it is not
dead.....

So folks, if you would sometime this weekend, hoist a beer/or
observe a moment of silence in memory of &quot;New Bug&quot;...cut down
in the prime of life at 45,000 miles!
