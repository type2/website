Last night I was working on the clock in my '65 Delux, when Grace (my 
two year old) asked what my multimeter was for.  I said &quot;Its for fixing
the car.&quot;  She responded: &quot;It's not a car dad, it's a BUS!&quot; (Actually,
she's almost three.   (BTW, does anyone have a 6V clock for a '65 Delux?)
