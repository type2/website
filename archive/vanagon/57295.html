&gt;Michelin no longer makes the MXL tires and I suppose the MXV is being
&gt;discussed as a potential replacement.  I'm not certain of MXV &quot;reinforced&quot; vs
&gt;&quot;non-reinforced&quot; details.

i would strongly recommend NOT getting the MXV's ... they are NOT
reinforced and hydroplaned badly on my 86 bus!!! and i mean like in
&quot;moderate&quot; rain at 40 mph. i got rid of them as quickly as i could afford.
