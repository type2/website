   Dave,
      I just did this job. YOur mechanic is afraid of the Vanagon, find a
      new one. If your axle is not glued into the hub, you can remove
      it in less than 30 minute. Mine was removed before, so I didn't 
      have this problem. The manual said to glue (thread lock) the
      splines in place. I would think that this would be the hardest
      part. Remove the center nut and push in on the axle, with a hammer
      over a piece of wood, to see if it is loose. YOu don't have to
      remove the bearing assembly, just the brake caliper and the
      upper ball joint.

         The rest is simple.
      Other problem I had- Be very careful with all clamps, with out 
      them being tight you will slowly lose the grease.
