Subject: Re: '82 Diesel Westy to 1.9L TDI




 &gt;I'm planing to convert my 82 diesel to a TDI. Anybody out there done
anything
 &gt;similar? I've got a source for the new engine. I'm thinking I'll have to
swap
 &gt;the tranny also to take advantage of the new power. I've got a line on a 5
 &gt;speed, from an '84, but i understand that,  that trans has about the same
 &gt;final drive as the 4 speed. You just get a granny first gear ( plus
 &gt;lockup???). Any experienced tranny folks out there? I seem to be on a
mission
 &gt;to do this. 
Thanks,
Bob Bellanca
