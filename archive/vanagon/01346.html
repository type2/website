Subject:      Fear, Despair, and Agony on me ... Home Auto Repair 101

Ralf spoke of the Fear of F**kup, in maintaining your car. William wisely
advised the use of an extra pair of eyes/hands/ears/etc.  Brent sagely
mentioned that, with Experience and Time, the Dark side of the Force can
be banished and replaced with Limited Confidence and Reckless Abandon.

my solution? always have a second car ... that runs. :) this way, you can
still go for a replacement part to the one that just rolled into the sewer
drain or ran off in the dog's mouth.

but that means extra money, extra insurance, extra parking space, extra
just-about-everything. :(  and what sort of vehicle to have as a second car?
well ... a beetle comes to mind as an excellent choice (keeping things in the
family, you know). or another bus. :)  but that's silly, isn't it? having TWO
of the same kind of car.

but it does help a lot to be able to quickly (?) drive down to the store and
pick up something you forgot or broke or lost. and having a location where
you can leave the bus/car/whatever that you are trying to fix ... just leave
it there ... for a day or so, well, it just don't get any better than this. :)

but even when you have all this, there are still episodes of sheer despair and
desparation! because we are human, we make mistakes. because of the Law of
Perversity of Inanimate Objects, cars just 'do' things to really piss us off
... and make us fearful of them. and the cars can SMELL that fear! and they
USE it against us! they ALL hate us, and loathe us ... they want to take over,
but they have no hands! yahahahahahahahaa.

it is Friday, isn't it?
