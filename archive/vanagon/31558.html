Subject: Re: where to stay when you're away?

&gt;Where would you stay?  Truck stop? Mall parking lot? All night burger joint?

        I always go for the truck stops. Rest areas on highways are an
obvious place for those generating bad karma to engage in criminal
activity. Truck stops tend to be safer 'cause the truckers keep an eye out
for that sorta thing, and don't care for it much. I've never had any
problems with redneck types-and my bus says &quot;mess with me, I'm a hippie&quot;.
The ponytail down past my butt kinda helps out the look a bit too... ;-)
The downside is the noise from all those diesels, but by the time I get
there, it don't matter *how* much noise there is-if I don't stop there,
I'll pass out within the next 30 miles...    ;-)

Peace,
