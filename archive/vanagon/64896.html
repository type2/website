Subject:      Woodstock show this weekend.

Hi Volks,
   Just a friendly reminder that the Hudson and Mohawk's VW club reunion
at Woodstock is this weekend. Its right in downtown Woodstock New York.
Although I don't think that the NY State thruway will be closed off
because of this event, its always a good time. Plus there is a campout,
'Buses in der woods', the nite before at the KOA just up the road in
Saugerties sponsored by GASS and LiMBO. Could be a nice get together for
List members.  See you there.!
