Well, I don't know about that.  I had a mechaic friend hook up my '77 bus 
to his exhaust gas analyzer.  The engine was cold 'cause we'd been 
chatting for a while.  It put out 99ppm of HC for about 3 minutes, then 
dropped to 46ppm.  When it dropped he mentioned that Cat kicking in.
That's about a 50% decrease.
