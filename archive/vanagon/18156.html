&gt; 1972 kombi: NO RUST (serious rust, anyway.) 135,000 miles. (?)might
&gt; 
&gt; 1974 Adventurewagen: NO RUST! Complete working (?) camper interior!
&gt; 
&gt; It was a package deal for $400.00 US.

Why do you people torment us in the rust belt so, NO RUST this
NO RUST that, $400 for both, it's as bad as the $15 each tire
stories, I'm going to shoot myself.  But really, sounds hard to
go wrong even if they had no engines period, mind you the brake
systems are likely to require copious amounts of work, not fun
IMHO as you might end up having to do everything new, certainly
new rotors and likely, calipers, hoses, wheel cylinders, pads
and shoes, all will probably be rusted to their respective matching
components but who knows you might get lucky.  BTW, if the gas
tanks were not drained, and or stabilizer not put in (and even
that would be pushing it after a couple of years) chances are you
might want to pull the tanks as well and have em boiled and coated
before you start these beasts for real, all new fuel lines probably
a must and vacuum lines as well.  LONG LIVE THE BAY WINDOWED BUS.
