Subject:      '70 Pop-up Camper for sale

I am looking at buying a double-cab pickup soon, so I need to look at selling
The Pickle.

Pros:
- recently rebuilt bottom end w/ new P&amp;J.  (universal case)
- rebuilt semi-hemi heads
- doghouse cooler.
- new steering dampner.
- new swing lever arm bushings.
- new fuel pump.
- new gas lines.
- has all cots (above and over front seats)
- urethane shift coupler.
- new front and rear brakes.
- extra clutch cable and accel. cable
- good stereo
- clock
- stock jack (if you're crazy enough to want to use it)
- new starter
- responds well to loving care.

cons:
- weird green paint job (why else would it be called &quot;The Pickle&quot;)
- rust in battery tray
- several rips in canvas

Asking $1000, will take $800 if it goes to a VW lover.

email with questions.
