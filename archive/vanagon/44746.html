&gt; In 1973 when I got my '66 camperbus I used to practice breaking loose the

&gt; traffic circles in Stockton, CA.  I had 185x14&quot; radials of low quality.  I
&gt; never came close to rolling the vehicle on dry streets.  I once did two
&gt; near perfect 360s in a row around a glorietta about 50' in diameter with
&gt; five people in the bus who spent most of the time hanging on or tumbling.

&gt; I found the key to safe sliding is making sure you break the rear end
&gt; loose before the lean gets too radical.

Many years ago a friend I was riding with went power-sliding around a turn on 
a dirt road in a '65 micro bus.  When I got home I immediately went out to 
practice in my '70 bubble window. (Hey! I was in high school. It seemed 
important to learn at the time.)  After my confidence built up, we had a 
go at it with both vehicles.  Almost like racing, except we were driving 
buses.

Breaking the rear end loose is a great trick to play when driving 
someone else's bus.  The reaction usually goes through several stages:
1)Screaming and yelling. &quot;Pull over; you're never driving my bus 
again!&quot;
2)Much simmering anger while calming down.
3)Chilled out.  Then the question; &quot;Now how exactly did you do that?&quot;
