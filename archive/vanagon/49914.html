&gt;Eric, I know what you mean.My best friend lives in Greentree in Pitt and it
&gt;is humid as hell in Summer(I used to visit him every year when I lived back
&gt;east)If the covers get wet and the humidity sticks underneath it may lift the
&gt;paint, or fog it.

 Hi all: Perhaps a better solution (depending on $ and space restrictions)
would be one of those little fabric quansit(?) huts. I was looking at one at
a RV lot and they are pretty neat. Just drive the rig in and zip up the door
behind. They make them in all sizes, and are easy to put up and tear down if
you have to move it. They even take quite a large snow load, if that is a
problem.
