&gt;Thanks so much for your invaluable help...  If you ever need some help 
&gt;with a project that involves Graphic Design, let me know.  I intend on 
&gt;owing you big time 'till I can get my bearings with this thing.  I 
&gt;haven't even found the battery yet--wait don't tell me.  I could use the 
&gt;surprise.

Man, does _everybody_ owe Joel or what?  I know I do...

Thom
