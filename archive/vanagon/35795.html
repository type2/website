Subject: Found a rustfree single cab

     I made a few phone calls yesterday looking for good drop sides for my 
     potential single cab venture. I found a nice set of Swedish ones for 
     180 quid.
     
     Whilst I was talking to the guy and explaining how i was attempting to 
     restore a REAL basket case pick-up, he suggested that I should buy 
     his.
     
     It turns out to be a San-Fransisco import, '60 model with twin loading 
     bay doors. I remember seeing it around the shows and it was sweet, 
     like real sweet - you know the old buses you see where the paint is 
     dull and there's zero rust - it's like that.
     
     It also has all the bows and canvas and a few NOS pickup only bits.
     
     The price? 2000 ukp
     
     I weighed up the cost of doing a *complete* resto on a basket case of 
     buying this rustfree one and just washing it!
     
     I'm going for the rustfree one, of course.
     
     Lee.
     
     '64 samba
     '60 pickup (mopst likely)
