Subject: Starter repair:replace wire to solenoid


	I have a starter problem with my 1971 camper. The wire that goes 
to the solenoid deteriorated and fell off, there is almost nothing left 
of it. Has anyone out there ever replaced this wire? I am tempted to 
solder a new wire in place, but I'm not sure it will work and I really 
want a permanent fix. I can't tell what gauge of wire to use either.
	The starter is a Bosch starter 311 911 023 B.

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
	Joel
