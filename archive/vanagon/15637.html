Well, its with some tripidation that I wade into to this debate, but it
being Easter Sunday , a time of redemption and forgivenesss, I'll take the
chance.....  :)


Last week I was driving the company van, a GMC Safari (probably not the
best of a sorry lot), from the office into the university. On the way I
passed by Elk Lake which butts right up against the hwy. &quot;Gee&quot; I thought
to myself, &quot;look at the whitecaps on the lake&quot;, the waves were steep and
short, breaking against the side of the lake against the hwy. 
So what is wrong with this picture? Well, until that point I hadn't
noticed how windy it was. The van wasn't affected at all by the crosswind,
mmm.If I had been driving the Vanagon, I sure would have noticed the
weather conditions, grrr.
So where does that leave me? Am I going to rush out and trade the Vanagon
in on a Safari? Not on your life!
What it does to me is start me thinking about how to further improve the
Vanagon's handling. But thats the way I think, others, if test driving the
two vans, would be right annoyed at the Vanagon's crosswind handling
ability. 

The Safari is a lot faster with the gas sucking V-6, and it has WONDERFUL
ABS brakes. Honestly, they are the best thing about that van. I really
wish I could retrofit ABS onto the Vanagon.

So, what my point? No van is perfect. There is no ultimate, or even
penultimate van. We like Vanagons for many tangible and a few
intangible reasons. But it is not a perfect vehicle,
so quit casting stones   :)
