Subject:       Brake System Vacuum Leak Fixed

Hi Everyone.  A few days ago I asked for help for a vacuum leak in 
the power brake system for my '87 Golf Diesel.  I received many 
replies, and wish to thank all of you for your valuable help, and 
time.  I have kept all replies in a file for reference should I be 
able to help others locally.  

I had the car fixed by my dealer yesterday.  The problem was with the 
vacuum booster.  The internal diaphragm was leaking, and causing the 
hissing upon pedal application.  Nobody had a replacement part 
available, not even jobber parts.  My dealer quoted me $499 for the 
part a few days ago, so all alternatives were looked at.  I didn't 
feel comfortable with a used brake booster, so I opted for a new part 
which had to be brought in from Toronto by VW.

For interest sake, the original booster was made in Brazil, and the 
replacement part came from Germany.  My dealer reduced the price of 
the part (we're regular customers with 3 VW's) from $499 to $397.90, 
and took 2.5 hours to do the work.  The master cylinder had to be 
removed, and installed on the new booster, and brakes bled.  

The outcome is VERY powerful brakes!   Wow, what a difference this 
has made.  When things deteriorate over time you adapt to the changes 
unknowingly, and when parts are changed you really notice the 
difference.  The pedal feels great with positive feel.  

Oh yes, the replacement part is actually made by Teves.

Thanks for your help,

Harry.
