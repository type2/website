Subject: RE: Clutch Cable/Tune Up

Brad asked:
How hard is it to change the cable.  I've decided to replace the entire 
cable any pointers would be appreciated.

The best thing to do is to get some very strong cord or wire and attach it to
the end of the cable before you pull the old cable out.  Then you can use the
cord to pull you new, well greased cable back in.  When I haven't used the pull
string method, the cable replacement went from a 15 minute job to an hour job.

Good luck!
