Ken,

The function of the splash shields is EXACTLY the opposite of cooling,
although there's a footnote to that as well.

Here's the situation:  You are running at speed.  You encounter rain, or a
puddle, or you ford a creek  (common stuff in Baja; no bridges!).  Want to
imagine what happens to your cast iron cylinders when they get an eyeful of
LIQUID water?

Situation 2.  You're running at speed, the air under the vehicle is at higher
than ambient pressure.  Beneath the cylinders the cooling air encounters
higher exit pressure at cylinders 1 &amp; 3, reducing cooling air flow.  The
result is that the portion of the cylinder at the 1 o'clock to about the 3
o'clock position (for #1 cyl; 9 to 11 for #3, in each case relative to an
observery looking into the cylinder from the valves) is running hotter than
the portion of the cylinder from about 4 to 6 (ie, 8 to 6), since that lower
portion is being super-cooled by the blast of air provided by the vehicle's
forward motion.

Situation 3 is as described in my sermon on push-rod tubes; they are part of
your cooling system.  But they are also part of your temperature CONTROL
system, in that they help the oil heat faster thus achieving a stable
operating temperature more quickly.

When the engine temperature is stable the engine performs more efficiently
and with less wear.  The splash shields form a plenum chamber for the cooling
air exhaust, allowing the cylinders to enjoy a uniform airflow regardless of
vehicle speed.  Plus their name sort of gives it away; liquid water can cause
sudden contraction of the cast iron jugs, resulting in oil leaks around the
lower spigot and compression leaks at the heads.  Bad things happen to a hot
air-cooled engine when it gets doused with water.  The splash shields form a
baffle, and so long as the blower is blowing, very little water SPRAY ever
contacts the cylinders... and no LIQUID water at all... unless you're really
trying to win.

We learned all this the hard way, stripping out baja's to the bone.  Less
weight, more acceleration.  We eventually saw that  Volkswagen engineers had
already been there, done that.  In the end, we re-designed our skid pans to
perform the baffling/shielding function and thus ended a host of problems
that had plagued us since our attempts to 'improve' on the original design.

If you really want to improve your engine, look at the Porsche, or the late
2000cc Type IV's; now work BACKWARDS, retrofitting your Type I/III with
things such as better lower shrouding (ie, Kool Tin), shaft seals (ie, Sand
Seals), hydraulic lifters, full-flow oil filtration, electronic ignition, an
external oil cooler (Dog-house Cooler) and so on.  It's really pretty easy to
be a VW guru when VW has already paid the engineering bill :-)
