Subject: Re: TIRES for VW Bus

Not to beat a dead horse, but....

The rotating weight of the tire would consume more torque when
accelarating, decelerating.  It would have absolutely no effect on
the usable horsepower while constant speed driving.

In other words, you'd get less mileage in stop-and-go traffic.  Out on
a long stretch of the highway, you may get different results due to
the fact that your engine is running at a slightly different rpm, but
producing the same horsepower (to overcome wind, tire and mechanical
friction). Another thing is that, unless you calibrate your
instruments you'll never know, of course :-)

 &gt; One thing I haven't seen mentioned in these tire posts is the rotating
 &gt; weight of the tire.  A larger tire likely weighs more and will therefore rob
 &gt; a bit of power.  The 185 tire should get better mileage.  Bicyclists know
 &gt; this stuff intimately.  Whether this is worth the trade in handling would be
 &gt; a personal decision.
