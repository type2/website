&gt;    Is there any kind of oil spray or undercoating that's safe to use?
&gt;They don't recommend it in the manual for my '85, but the Canadian
&gt;Winter is taking its toll on my exhaust system! What's a good way to
&gt;protect it without having it melt or catch fire during those hot
&gt;summer drives to the cottage?

I coated mine with the 450F engine spray paint. Don't know if it will help,
but it looks cool to have teh exhaust cherry red;-)
