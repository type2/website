&gt; Does anyone know about the chances of said electric pump fitting my

It seems to me that this would be easy to do.  I know what you mean
about the manual pump.  I bought a rebuild kit from a local RV supply
place, and it worked good for a while, but if it sits unused for any
length of time, then all the water drains out, and it takes a lot of
effort to get it primed again.  One solution to this (which I haven't
tried yet) is to get a small in-line check valve (again from the local
RV supply) so the water doesn't drain out.
