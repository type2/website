Subject: camping gear


Ric et al:  I will soon be posting a list of suggested items
to bring along on the brick tour.  Many of you have already
made wonderful suggestions, which I've incorporated, and I
welcome all further additions.  This list is, BTW, not
just camping stuff, but stuff to have on a long trip like
this, cooking items, conveniences, parts, tools, etc., - whatever.

Anyway, will try to get this edited and posted during 
the weekend...
