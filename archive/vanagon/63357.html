I put in 100W H3's and got a relay from my FLAPS, actually it was an =
import only place, but they had the right relay, had a VW P/N???, and it =
works great.  I ran 12 gauge from the relay to the battery and left the =
stock wire in front.  The light output dramatically increased after I =
installed the relay, the switch apparently is not very efficient, I did =
not notice the switch getting hot with the 100W bulbs and no relay, but =
I never left them on for long periods of time.  Also, has anyone ever =
used &quot;Eurolights&quot;?  They are standard or higher wattage but produce a =
bluish light.  I am thinking of putting these in my low beams, but they =
are $40 a pair, the H3's were $5 each.
