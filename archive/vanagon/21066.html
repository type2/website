Subject: Evap coolers

Joel Walker mused... 
&gt;and in the southwest, years ago, weren't there some sort of Evaporative
&gt;Coolers for houses?? that used something like that to cool the house 
(instead
&gt;of a compressor system a/c)??

They still do use them.  The intellgent homeowner in southern Arizona can 
save big bucks on  the electric bill with them.   Come to think of it, you 
could spray the mist into your radiator, duct the air into the cab of your 
Westie and heat/humidify it in the winter!
