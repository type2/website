Subject: Duarte's Import Auto Salvage

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

On my way cross country from California to Texas, I happened upon a new
import salvage yard in El Paso.  The business is Duarte's Import Auto
Salvage at 12460 Gateway East, El Paso, TX 79927 Phone 915 851-5555.

I stopped to investigate an '86 GL which is without the engine, but the
exhaust is present, and the rest of the vehicle, including seats with arm
rests, is reasonably intact.  l met the owner, Mr. Duarte, who is an
amiable fellow to whom I gave the address of the list.

I advised him of the non-commercial nature of the list, but he could be of
help to members who are seeking parts.

Usual disclaimers apply.
