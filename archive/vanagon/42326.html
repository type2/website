&gt;I called the Bull Run Park, Burke Lake Park, and Prince William
&gt;National Forest in search of camp sites.  I prefer Bull Run, but here is a
&gt;precis of each site:
&gt;
&gt;Bull Run:
&gt;
&gt;Location:
&gt;This park is on the order of 10 miles from the Bugout.  The woman who
&gt;answered the phone at the park said it would likely be 30-40 minutes to
&gt;the Bugout (real bad traffic).  On the other hand, I know some
&gt;back roads that may halve that time.  Also this is a beautiful location.
&gt;Facilities:
&gt;Electric, showers, toilets.
&gt;Price:
&gt;$14.50/night
&gt;Reservations: Yes! but they are low on space.  We would need to call
&gt;today.  I talked to Pam there and if you mention &quot;vanagon&quot; she will do her
&gt;best to block us.  You will need a CC and the first night is not
&gt;refundable.
&gt;
&gt;
Bull Run Park is the best place around there to camp. I have stayed there
for the last 7 years.
I will be there again this year . On of the reasons that the campground is
usually full is because that
weekend is the &quot;Run to the Wall&quot; and the place is full of bikers. They have
been coming to the 
campground for the last 3 years. Areally nice bunch of people. I will be
there , 
&quot;East Coast Joe&quot; Gunyan will be there , and usually Dennis Haynes shows up
late on Saturday. If anyone is thinking of staying at Bull Run or just
visiting stop by at site 88.
