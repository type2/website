Subject:      Vanagon list at SDSC/GERRY - READ

To one &amp; all;

Around 9 am Pacific time (in about 15 minutes), Thursday, August 21st, I
am going to be modifying the VANAGON subscribers list (incorporating the
lenti list at UMN into the gerry list). So for about 30-60 minutes (I'm
giving myself some breathing room), you will not be able to make any
changes (unsubscribe, change digest, no mail, etc.) to your accounts (best
case scenario) or no mail will be processed at all (worst case scenario).
The list will be back no later than 10 am.

THIS IS JUST TEMPORARY --- TO CHANGE THE SUBSCRIBERS LIST
