&gt;i thought this list determined that &quot;Obsessive/Compulsive&quot; was the
&gt;correct diagnosis?  Which is it?  I mean, we can't be using the
&gt;incorrect term when the correct term is available, can we?  That's
&gt;what's wrong with society nowadays, we settle for the mediocre and
&gt;'pretty good'.  Where has exactness gone?  Orderliness?  Linear
&gt;concrete thinking?  I mean I'm not being obsessive about this am I?
&gt;Or is it compulsive?  :)


That's Linearly concrete thinking. Get it right.
