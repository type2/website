Subject: St. Muir



With all the discussion lately Re: John Muir I guess that now
is a good time to ask...
Does anyone have (or know someone who has) a first edition of
the idiot guide that they would be willing to part with?  I would
v. much like to add one to my library.  Name your price.

Also, along the same line, John was a v. nice man.  I had the
_privlege_ of meeting him and his wife in SantaFe many years
ago.  (They lived up the street from my sister in law.)  For
the critics,  he would have said, &quot;You can do it better? Then,
start writing!&quot;  He had forgotten much more than most of us
will ever learn. (Both about VWs and about life.)  For more 
insight into St. Muir the man, haunt the used book stores
for a copy of his B/P for society _The Velvet Monkeywrench_,
long out of print.
