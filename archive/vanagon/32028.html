&gt; 
&gt; Howdy strangers; been lurkin'.
&gt; 
&gt; Several have commented on the ads.  The &quot;think small&quot; b&amp;w early-60s 
&gt; stuff was done by ad agency Doyle Dane Bernbach or something equally 
&gt; alliterative, if memory serves.  There's a book on 'em.
&gt; 
&gt; Back in my undergrad persuasion class I did a study of VW ads in 
&gt; major magazines over the period roughly 1960-80. Cool way to do a 
&gt; semester project.   Interesting how they change to a busy, coloful, flashy-trashy style about the time 
&gt; the wasserkuhlers start showing up.  (I couldn't figure a way to do a 
&gt; dissertation on The Rhetoric of VWs or I'd have that Ph.D. today.)
&gt; 
&gt; Terry Schuler's book has some neat repros of some of the older 50's Reuters 
&gt; ads that always make me feel like I had some bad mushrooms because 
&gt; the people look way too small and the cars are all windswept.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh!  and a Westy tent Q: Larry Clark (no admissible relationship) of 
&gt; Seattle noted to me in email:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;year I blundered into a near new Free Stander for sale. I don't think the tent
&gt; &gt;had ever been used as the poles were still in their shipping box. The pole bag
&gt; &gt;had never been used. Anyway, included in the setup was a white light weight
&gt; &gt;canvas afair designed to go on over the top of the tent. If you look at the poles
&gt; &gt;of this type of tent, you will notice that there are up right pegs in the upper four corners
&gt; &gt;of the poles. The rain fly has grommets which slip over these pegs. The fly itself
&gt; &gt;is quite tight and as a result helps prevent water from getting into the tent. 
&gt; 
&gt; Wotzis?  I coulda stayed dry in Bahia Honda?  
&gt; This thing doesn't show in any of the pix or parts diagrams 
&gt; I have, but I have a paucity of later (post 75) stuff.  First I heard 
&gt; of it -- anyone else seen it?

Joe

i know the four little &quot;upright pegs&quot; that you are referring to... however i have a fairly original tent and 
have not seen that white canvas doo-dad that you are referrng to, and as you say it is not even 
mentioned in the &quot;official&quot; vw parts manual.

i always figured that those four uprights were used to secure cords to, to keep your tent from blowing 
away on a windy day.

does this mean i have to hunt down one of those white things now ;)??
