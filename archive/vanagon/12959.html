Subject: Re: Considering a 59 single cab purchase


&gt;I have a book that covers T II back to 61, is the 59 similar enough or 
&gt;do I need a new book.  &gt;Are there any publications that would cover 
&gt;this year other than the idiot manual? Also what is the availability 
&gt;of parts such as: master cylinder, brake drums, brake pads, etc.&gt;jason

	The '59 has a 36hp engine.  It has a lot of differeces from the
40hp in a '61.  Wolfsburg West sells a Transporter Shop Manual for
about $30.  It covers the 36hp pretty well.  It's european so some
terminology is a little different.
	The master cylinder is the same as 
up to '66.  Brake drums are available, although more pricey than '64
up.  Brake pads are readily available.  Wheel cylinders are available,
but more expensive than '64 on.
	I've ordered parts from Wolfsburg West, Vintage Parts, Das Bulli
Haus, Rocky Mountain Motor Works &amp; a few others.  The only problems I've
had was having to wait because it seems anything I want has to be on 
back-order.
	If you have other more specific questions I'd be happy to help.
