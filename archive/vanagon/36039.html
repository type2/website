&gt;Hi..
&gt;I need some advice regarding u-joints and syncro driveshafts.
&gt;Both u-joints in the driveshaft of our 87 syncro went bad,
&gt;making it vibrate like crazy.
&gt;I got my friendly local mechanic to remove the driveshaft,
&gt;leaving me with one of the few 2 wheel drive syncros in
&gt;captivity (at least doesn't vibrate anymore). Anyway, he managed
&gt;to replace the joints but the vibration is still there. I asked
&gt;him to rebalance the shaft and he claims that this is
&gt;virtually imposible since &quot;no one&quot; has the yokes required
&gt;to grab the shaft and balance it.
&gt;
&gt;

Even if you have the shaft balanced, there is a good chance it will stil
vibrate.  I think that when a joint goes bad bad, the whiping actually
distorts the shaft rendering it useless.  This is only way I can expalin that
once a joint goes bad, the shaft can not be fixed.  Also note that the
u-joints are often shimmed to one side to maintain concentricity.
Dennis.
