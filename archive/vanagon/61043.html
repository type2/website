&gt; I may be able to go to Buses on 66. Only problem is that this opportunity
&gt; just came up and I haven't been following the thread on it. Can someone
&gt; please tell me the  what, when and where of it? I would really like to go
&gt; and meet some of the listees in person.

Busses on '66' is held at the beautiful Springfield, Missouri KOA
Kampground (next to Deer Lake golf course which straddles Interstate 44
about 5 miles west of Springfield).  There is no fee associated with this
event other than what KOA charges.

Friday evening will just be informal greeting, visiting, etc.
Saturday will be the June Bug Jamboree All VW Show &amp; Swap (beginning about
8 am for you swap meet junkies and going until about 3:30 pm).  The
Jamboree will end with a circular cruise of Route 66 through Springfield.
Saturday night will be a cruise to Ozark, MO (about 20 miles) to catch the
Ozark Mountain Daredevils and Brewer &amp; Shipley concert (or you can hang
at the camp and swim, go to the Hot Rod Nationals out at the Fair
Grounds, or ??).
Sunday morning will be a free pancake breakfast (don't expect any
professionalism here, you will eventually get fed as long as me and my
griddle hold out).  Bring your own beverage.
Sunday towards noon we will disband and cruise the old section of Route 66
(east or west) for about 60 miles and stop for lunch and say goodbyes ...

Send your snail mail address and I'll send you a flyer with a map.

Hope to see you *all* there!
