Subject: [Late]Friday:  Got my list mug!!:)


Hey folks, sorry i missed friday (i was busy becoming reaquainted with my 
old Atari 800!!:)

But, on friday, my list-mug came in!!!:)

Love it..:)

I know i was first in Augusta to get a List Sticker (loaned one to Niel, 
cause of a mix-up....), and I assume i'm first with a mug...:)

Feelin warm and fuzzy.....david
