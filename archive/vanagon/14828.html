Subject: Sociolinguism of Type II Owners: Call for Papers

          *************CALL FOR PAPERS*******************

The First Annual Conference on the Sociolinguism of Type II Owners and the
WWW will take place at the CyberSpace Motel 6 in Kissimmee.FL.  With an
inadequate block of rooms available at hugely inflated &quot;special conference
rates,&quot; the CyberSpace Motel Six is located just twelve grueling US92 
miles and six hundred stoplights from Walt Disney World.  Shuttle service 
is available, but there are no seats in the back and you have to watch 
out for that oil can.

Dedicated to a teleological paradigm of elegant heuristicity, the
Conference will feature speakers from across the globe.  Many have
something to sell and will bring colorful brochures.  Others are on
sabbatical, trolling for resume fodder.  One has made a killing with the
hugely successful Mo'wagen WWW browser -- now in version 6.0375B26 --
which began as an undergraduate research project at the Florida Institute
of Business Technology and Auto Body Repair in nearby Chuluota. 

The Conference will also feature technical displays and demonstrations by
a crowd of grinning, shark-like individuals crammed into curtained booths 
in a poorly-ventilated ampitheatre. SCHEDULED TO APPEAR:

	EMPI Microsystems, makers of the Woodgrained Workstation series.

	Magnesium-Alloy Graphics Inc., manufacturers of split-case 
	desktop systems.

	IVW, netvergnugen pioneer, will display the new chrome-plated,
	billet aluminum, drop-forged, counterweighted Big Ass Server.

	VolkTel, makers of the race-winning 801835cc microprocessor.

Conference Keynote:
&quot;How come we talk like this?&quot;  Waldo Greasemonkey, Chairman, VolkSpeak 
Publications Group.
