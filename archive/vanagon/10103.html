 Michael Heron suggests:

&gt; Pat, Joe ( and all other Westy manual owners):
&gt; 
&gt; why don't we pool our resources, and make copies of our manuals, and trade
&gt; with each other. In my humble (as compared to Joel's) data summarizing
&gt; skills I surmize the following manuals are currently owned by the following
&gt; subscribers
&gt; 
&gt; Pat Walsh- 78' Westy manual
&gt; Joe Clark- 68'-72' Westy Manual
&gt; Michael Heron- 1967 Westy Manual (approx. 40 pages tres detailed)
&gt; 
&gt; i like seeing Westy manuals from all years :):)

 If I will avoid becoming a casualty of a flamewar, I can offer copies of the
 original Westfalia manual that came with my '74. All the photos are in black
 and white so no-one will have to endure the overpowering ORANGE of the 
 curtains and upholstery!

 '74 and '75 campers are unique, and after seeing the manuals I am sure you 
 will all want one and, lucky for you, a pristine and complete interior 
 should be available soon from a certain Sami Dakhlia who is *allowing* his
 lovely bus to be rusted away in an uninhabitable part of the country. Whew.
