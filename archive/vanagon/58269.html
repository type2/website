Subject: tranny swap

I have a westy diesel that I am getting myself ready to convert to a
jetta gas engine.  Some of you have given me some good advice to get
going on this project.  My goal is to make it to Carlisle for the LiMBO
gathering!!!!

Anyway, I know I could do it later, but in case someone needs a deisel
tranny and bell housing, I am looking for a swap for a gas set.  I
understand that can be any gas (aircooled or wasserboxer) vanagon tranny
and housing.

Thanks.  If something doesn't work out soon, I will make do with what I
have and change the tranny later.
