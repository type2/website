Subject: Engine update

Well, I finally got my case back from the machinist, who had screwed it up 
and bored it too small.  I told him this, and of course he didn't believe 
me, but after looking at it, he said that the tool bits wore down on the 
boring bar, causing the case to be cut too small.  Look out for this if 
you're going to have a case line bored.

I got the case together, but had to replace the timing gear which the same 
guy had beat the crap out of with a hydralic press.  Arrgh!  I've got three 
P&amp;c's on, but the last one doesn't look right.  Looks like a bent conn rod, 
so next time I'm going to get some blueprinted rods from Pauter or Berg.  To 
many hassles!!  It looks like I have to take that rod out and take it to a 
local shop to get it straightened.

Here's another:  I CC'ed the combustion chambers, and got them all to within 
.5CC of each other.  So I measured the deck height and got .089&quot; and the CR 
is 7.7 to one.  This is with .040&quot; shims, without them,  CR= 8.45 to one.  
The jist of it is that the shims must be factory, or else the CR would be 
through the roof.  The case is a T3, late 70 - 71.  I think these had 7.7 to 
one CR right?

Does anyone have an opinion on 7.7 to one or is this still too high for my bus?
