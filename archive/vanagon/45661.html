Subject: Kingpins and Linkpins, '66 standard



Hi all,

The guys at the shop that I had take a look at the front end on
my '66 recommended that I re-bush my kingpins and linkpins.  Anyone
have any experience with this?  I had 'em replace the drag-link
and tie-rod ends but they said they don't do king/link pin work.
I've seen the assembled, rebuilt, king/link pin units sold for
$199 exchange, is this the best way to go?  Another shop in town
says they will rebuild my existing king/link pins but I haven't
got a quote yet and that shop is a little questionable IMHO.

Cheers,

 -Dyer
