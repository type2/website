Dave,  I saw you mention BC in your post.  Check www.buysell_dot_com  
That's our local (Vancouver) free ad paper which comes out every 
Thursday.  The ads are updated on the web every Friday, and you can 
do a complete word search in about 30 seconds.  A real deluxe search 
system IMHO.  Don't forget to search 'Westfalia' or 'Westphalia' if 
you're looking for a camper.

&gt; &gt;From Sami:
&gt; &gt;For $2,600 -$3,000 I expect a bus to be almost perfect, rustwise.
&gt; &gt;I suggest you spend 2 weeks and US$2,500 in California. 
&gt; 
&gt; I wish I could spend 2 weeks in Cali! I was in Monterey a couple of months ago, and got a sore neck spotting all of the pristine type II's down there. I don't really have the time or $$ right now to
&gt; make the trip, though. The selection here in Calgary sucks. I've heard British Columbia is the place to go (in Canada), but prices tend to be higher. The US/CDN exchange rate is also an issue (for C
&gt; , not BC :) at 74 US cents to 1 Cdn dollar, $2500US equates to about $3400 Cdn. $2600 CDN (what I'd be willing to pay, conditional on mechanical inspection) works out to about $1925US.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the responses I've gotten so far, I'd classify this one as coming down with a bout of rust, not mortally wounded :). Almost all of the busses I've seen around here could be classified as sick 
&gt; o terminal to DOA. Given that, I've decided this one warrants an investment in an inspection. A couple of long-time VW owners I know have pointed me to a German guy who they swear by. I suspect the 
&gt; nspection will bring out a few other items, but I can use that as ammo to lower the selling price.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll keep you up to date on the progress, and thanks again for the great response!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dave.
