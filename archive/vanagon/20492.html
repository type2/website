Subject: Westy bed mechanism

I have been searching for a used rear seat/bed for a while now without any 
luck. I saw one at a swap meet at the weekend but it was not a westfalia bed 
and looked to be cobbled together out of bits of angle iron. I know where I 
can buy the hinges new but I don't like the idea of paying 60 quid, plus 
whatever it costs to ship them from Germany. I'm going to make some if I can 
get the dimensions right. Can anyone please measure up their hinges and let 
me know the lengths between the joints? This is for a bay-window bus BTW. 
Thanks in advance.

Andy E.
