Subject: NWVW Club Wintermeet (?)


Well I finally did it-  I made it to my first VW meet since my Westy purchase
several months ago.  And boy, did I score!
Despite not understanding how, under beautiful skies just hours 'til May-day,
this gathering was a &quot;winter&quot; meet, I found many goodies:

1. Muir manual- newest edition- $8
2. Pair of like new big late-bus tail lenses- $20
3. Cariacature of my wife (who I am relieved to say had a blast, too), by 
a really cool and talented cartoonist- $5 (picture of her *in my camper!*)

4. THE BIGGEE!... A Full '78 westy big table, with hinged portion and 
leg! - $20!  :-0   Yow!

5. many phone #'s, for future reference.  also upcomin' event info- a 
meet in Vancouver, BC; one in Southern Oregon (Rosewood?); Portland; and 
Yakima, to name a few...
My brother got mucho cool stuff too- can't wait for the next one...

	Jeff
