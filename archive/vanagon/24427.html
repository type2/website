&gt; Here's the funny part.  At the junkyard, I also found the cot that goes
&gt; in the poptop!  Looked to be in good shape, too.  Got it for $12.95.
&gt; Installed it - looks nice!  Wonder if I can fit up there?  I remembered
&gt; something about a 200lb weight limit, no prob. I only weigh 165.
&gt; Climbed up there, and found I fit pretty well (I'm 6'0&quot;).  I could sleep
&gt; up here in a pinch.  I lean up to open a zipper in the tent, and
&gt; *riiiiiip* my big 'ole butt punches right through the canvas and I fall
&gt; through to the floor.  Good thing the table wasn't set up!  So now I
&gt; have a $13 cot that's ripped to shreds.  :(

The same thing happend to my cot...  I was on a camping trip with some
friends.  When it came time to divvy up the sleeping places, I told my buddy
Bob (who's 6'4&quot; and skinny as a rail), 'you can sleep up in the cot... It
will be perfect for you'.  Of course I didn't let on how I hated sleeping in
that thing when I was a kid because it was so damn narrow and restricting. 
So he beds down for the night and it was just about lights out when he
proudly shouts, &quot;hey, this bed is great! I'm going to set up a cot like this
in my bedroom!&quot;  Right after he got those words out, we heard the big
Riiiip...  Just had to share that with you Volks.
