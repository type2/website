Subject: Re:  Voltage Regulator

I replace these in my cars all the time.  All of my cars have had Bosch 
Alternators and I usually buy them for about $25 from the local Hi-Lo 
auto parts store.  I KNOW that the alternator on the Vanagons is less 
than $30.  $56 for a voltage regulator seems real high.
