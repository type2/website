Subject:  Front bumper, crash cage, Can you help me find a source?

Can you tell me a source for these front bumper, crash cage (deer catcher)?
Can you point me in the right direction?


As described by Avery  rao2_at_lehigh_dot_edu (elfking):
Subject: Brazilian Busses

&gt;my roommate just came back from his home in brazil and he brought me pictures
&gt;of his friends bus.
&gt;it is a 1991 bus: this model has late 70's front and rear turn signals, the
&gt;rear hatches are from the pre 67 models, as are the 4 square side windows and
&gt;corner rear windows, there is a crash cage attached to the front bumper-the
&gt;kind you see on havy 4wd vehicles in the states-it extends up to the front
&gt;turn signals and out to the headlights, it has rounded bumpers i believe are
&gt;early 70's (without the step under the front doors).

TIA
