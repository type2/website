&gt;I have found that transmitting a signal on the CB radio typically sets off
&gt;the little red oil warning lamp befoe the driver in late model Vanagons. Not
&gt;to be afraid, its just the CB; took me a few times to get the correlation.

I've used a CB in my Vanagons for years and haven't had this happen.  The
antenna is mag mounted on the roof about 2' behind the windhield.  I have
experienced occasional interruption in radio voulme though - it was kind of
convenient actually.  Would have been more convenient if the radio volume
would have reduced upon receiving a signal instead of broadcasting.  I've
never tried it with an antenna inside the car such as on a walkie talkie type
CB.
