Subject: Stuck Solenoid

Item Subject: cc:Mail Text
So I made my first significant trip in my '77 camper this weekend, to Death 
Valley.  Actually, I only made it as far as Barstow because my starter 
solenoid got stuck at a gas station.  The handy advice in the Idiot's Guide 
worked like a charm to get me started again, but I abandoned the trip since 
I didn't think Daeth Valley was the right place to be headed without 
feeling pretty comfortable about vehicle reliability!

Now that I'm running again my questions are:

1.  How often can I expect the solenoid to stick from now on?

2.  Is this a sign it going to fail permanently soon?

3.  How much will it cost me to get it fixed if it does fail?

Thanks.

Jim
