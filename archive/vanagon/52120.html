Subject:  Want to Buy: Syncro Westy

I am trying to find a good Syncro Westy for a friend.  A late 80's or early
90's model is preferred.  It needs to be excellent shape all around.  He is
not inclined to do much work on it himself.   He wants to travel no more
than 12 driving hours from New Orleans La. if possible.  He  does not
have e-mail so contact him directly if you have any good leads.  His name
is John and is phone number is 504-381-9450.  If you know of any other
places online for me to look, please let me know by private E-mail since I
am only on the type2 list.  Thanks, Mark
