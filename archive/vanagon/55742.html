Subject: Re: Questions About Buying Diesel Westi 

&gt; &gt;valve adjustments pretty often? My Diesel has now 150,000 km
&gt; &gt;and I had no need for valve adjustments. I would not say any
&gt; &gt;wrong, but there should be hydraulic lifters.
&gt; 
&gt; COMMENT: I believe that later VW diesels had hydraulic lifters.  Too late for Vanagon,
&gt;          though.
&gt; 

Too late in the US, but diesel Vanagon continued indefinitely? in 
Europe, hence probably recieved the hydraulics in '86?  Anyway round 
why would you want one save to put a gas engine in.  Of course Ron's 
Parts imports them new 1.9l diesels with the D port heads, supposed 
to be pretty snappy in Golf GTD conversions, might almost make that 
diesel Westy and appealing sort of thing.  Anybody try this yet?
