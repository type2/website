Subject: Re: Help me get my front seats apart!

Jim Bryant hit the nail on the head: the seat back uphostery is held in 
place by little bend-back tabs at the bottom of the seat back.

The bottom cushion is heald in place by a little cardbord strip inserted 
in a narrow groove running around the edge of the seat, on the 
underside.  Pull this strip out (it may help to compress the seat the get 
it out) and the seat cover will lift off!
