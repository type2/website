Subject: DC-MD-VA COOKOUT SEPT 9



Ok, folks.  For those of you who are seeing this for the first time:

WHAT:  Cookout at Chris Chubb's
       Evening Cruise through Old Town Alexandria

WHEN:  Saturday, September 9th, 2pm - ??

WHO'S INVITED: ANYBODY who likes and/or has air-cooled VWs
(If your VW isn't currently running, then bring pictures!)
Invite your non-Internet friends with VWs too--if we run out of room
in Chris' backyard, we'll move to the local park!

WHAT TO BRING:  Yourself, your family (if they can stand it), your VW or
pictures of it, drinks, snacks (chips, etc) to share, LAWN CHAIRS.

Chris will provide grills and hamburgers; if you don't eat hamburgers then
please bring whatever you like.

Unfortunately I had to go and leave the directions at home, so I will pester
Chris to post them, or I'll post those tomorrow.  He lives just off I-95 near
Old Town Alexandria.

Please come!  We're all looking forward to seeing you!

If you have any questions, please e-mail me or Chris (cchubb_at_ida_dot_org)
