1) For some reason the passengers's side door on the 82 Westy lock was not
working
properly this afternoon; the small flap that covers the key hole entrance had
somehow
jammed inside making it difficult to insert and remove the key; it is spring
loaded, right? My question is, do I need to remove the entire lock
mechanism and handle to fix this?

2) The sliding door handle is wobbly; the entire lock and handle have been
taken apart, tightened greased and re-installed. Is there a bushing of
some sort that breaks down here and does it need to be replaced?

3) Does any one have any experience in installing &quot;anchors&quot; for rear (and
forward) facing baby seats? At present, Madeleine's chair can only go in
the front
because of the three point anchor; we would prefer to move the seat to the
rear bench but this would require a third anchor point right?  

Thanks in advance - David C.
