	Subject: Got back from Baja

	I took my first trip to Baja in my '71 campmobile.

As a European, I was used to criss-crossing borders on vacation, but
after arriving in California, I have been told so many scary stories,
that in 15 years I have never dared to drive into Mexico.

Anecdotes say that
- driving down the highway, you WILL be held up either by robbers
  or by the police, who want a hundred dollars to let you go
- no US insurance company will write you insurance valid in Mexico,
  and it is next to impossible (and next to unaffordable) to buy
  Mexican insurance for a short trip
- poor people will throw their kids in front of a Norteamericano
  vehicle and sue the driver; they may be short one kid, but now
  the surviving family is rich.
- teenagers who resent Norteamericanos will vandalize your vehicle

I have always WANTED to take a (winter ?) vacation in Mexico, but
with these stories, I thought that I would have to fly in and rent
from Avis locally.

It sounds like people on the list have MUCH more cheerful stories.
I would like to hear more of people's experiences.
