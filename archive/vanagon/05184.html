Subject: Re: Screens and Wiper Fluid Pump (again!)

&gt; In my business we get a lot of sample products.  One of them
&gt;follows this particular vein.  It's called &quot;Hot Jet&quot; screen
&gt;wash.  First off I can't recommend it because I have not
&gt;bothered to take it out of its box.  Second I have never seen it
&gt;in a store.
&gt;What it is... a plastic box with the inside hollowed out to fit
&gt;around a radiator hose, two zip ties, and 10 feet of plastic 
&gt;hose.  The assembly is very simple looking, as you might
&gt;imagine.  The box sets on top of the top radiator hose, the
&gt;tubes are routed through the box and back to the washer.
&gt;  The product appears to be from Canada.  The only address I
&gt;have is Cross Border Marketing, Van. B.C.  Made in Hong Kong.
&gt;  This might be easier than creating your own setup, I don't
&gt;know.  Good luck!!!!

I had a home-brewed version of this on a Mini I owned. Just got a length of 
washer tubing, wrapped it round and round a hose going to the heater, just 
below the windshield, and wrapped a piece of insulation around it. A couple 
of cable ties held it all in place. It worked great, and cost nothing.
