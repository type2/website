Subject: Drivability issue revisited-intermittent stalling

In the last year my 90 Vanagon has on 4 or 5 occasions showed symptoms of
the intermittent stalling while driving.  This problem is very well
described in the vanagon archives and the symptoms (and fix) were clearly
described by derekdrew.  The fix was to buy a auxillary wiring harness for
the air flow box (part # 025906302).  Up to this point I have not taken my
van to a mechanic to have this checked out because it is very intermittent
and has not really been a problem for me.  Anyways my question is this,
have other owners replaced this harness, and has the intermittent stalling
disappered after doing this fix?  Also how difficult is this for a
shadetree mechanic to do?  Has anyone replaced the harness and had the
problem persist?

Thanks,
