Subject: Re: Universal Cases

James,

In regard to the universal case, the most important difference between
the Type III case and Type I &amp; 2 cases is going to be the location of
the oil filler/dipstick tube. On the Type III the tube is bolted
onto the case to the right (if you are facing the rear of the car)
of the oil pump. There is a hole slightly larger than a quarter
drilled into the case as well as holes for the two mounting studs.

I guess you could have the case drilled for it. Couple of other 
things...you will need to block off the area where the generator
stand bolts up to the case as well as where the fuel pump would
sit for the Typ 1 &amp; 2s.
