Subject: cylinder head cracked

Bad news! Have a 1984 Westie. Just found out today that there is a
crack in the right cylinder head. (Not leaking badly yet). My Volkswagen
dealer wants $1600.00 to fix it. Ouch! What to do? Anybody have a
suggestion on how to save money? Anybody want to buy it? Vehicle lived
in California from 1984 to 1995 and is in near mint condition. (Except
for the cracked head). Only 50,000 miles on the clock. I'd really like
to keep it but $1600.00 is a lot of dough.

								Friday nite.
