&gt; This is a question for the &quot;electronically inclined&quot; out there. How
&gt; difficult would it be to set up a three LED indicator that would tell the
&gt; driver if the O2 Sensor is reading rich, lean, or &quot;stochiometric&quot; for one
&gt; and three wire FI systems? Such
&gt; a device might be helpful as a way of assessing basic driving habits and
&gt; engine tune.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks  for any ideas.

I'm by no means an expert on O2 sensors, but I just happened to have a reprint 
of an article titled &quot;Lambda closed-loop control&quot; on my desk that I've been 
perusing.

I quoteth: &quot;The voltage supplied by the lambda sensor as a result of the oxygen 
content in the exhaust reaches 800...1000 mV with rich mixtures (lambda &lt;1), but
it is only about 100mV with lean mixtures (lambda &gt;1). The transition from the 
lean to the rich range lies at 450...500 mV.&quot; Reaction time is &lt;50 mSec.

Soooo, you should be able to do it easily with a regulator and something like an
LM3914 to drive the LEDs. You might like more than 3 to get the resolution you 
need. This is a pretty simple circuit if you've ever breadboarded a circuit. If 
not.......

I think someone on the list has a commercial version of this. If you build it 
yourself, the materials would be less that $10.

Happy (exhaust) trails.
