Subject: Q's about install of cruise control syst


Since Sears no longer sells cruise control systems (at least not in my area) 
and I wanted to look at one first, I bought one at Pep Boys.  It is made by 
Equus.  The servo is a large black plastic 'can'.  Control wires and vacuum 
line attach on one side and the cruise control throttle cable exits the 
opposite side.  The control panel is a small rectangular box with two 
buttons, an on/off switch, and an indicator LED.

For those of you that have installed aftermarket cruise systems, I need the 
benefit of your experience.......

The system detects engine RPM from the negative side of the ignition coil, 
therefor no speed sensor or magnet sensors.

Evidently the system is sensitive to electormagnetic interference from the 
coil, alternator, plug wires, etc so the installation manual says that the 
servo should be placed at least 12&quot; from any of the above ignition 
components.  If your system had this requirement, where did you locate the 
servo?   I'd like to put it under the rear bench seat and run the control 
cable and vacuum line throught the fire wall, but the fuel tank is there (I 
have an 87 syncro van--gas tank is in the back).  So now I have to look at 
the engine compartment.

thanks and HNY!

please respond to me directly since I do not recieve daily list 
correspondance.
