&gt;         This is what I know.  There is a show on Saturday and a Campout at
&gt; a KOA campgrounds on Friday night near a golf course and all this is in
&gt; Springfield, MO.  That is it.  I am clueless.  Someone help me out here.  I
&gt; need some specifics.   

I'll go ahead and post this (some folks will need it before Friday).

How to find the June Bug Jamboree in Springfield, Missouri:

&gt;From Kansas City - Take Highway 13 south to Springfield (it will become
Kansas Expressway when you hit town). Turn east on Chestnut Expressway.
Go south on Boonville until it dead ends at the show on Park Central
Square.

&gt;From Tulsa - Take I-44 to Springfield and take the Kansas Expressway Exit
south.  Go south to Chestnut Expressway and head east to Boonville.  Turn
south on Boonville.  It dead ends at the show.

&gt;From St.Louis - Take I-44 to Springfield and take the Glenstone Street
Exit (80-A).  Go south to Chestnut Expressway and turn right (west).  Go
south on Boonville until it dead ends at the show.

&gt;From Branson - Take Highway 65 to Springfield and take the Chestnut
Expressway Exit.  Go west to Boonville and take a left until it dead ends
at the show.

The landmark to look for when turning on Boonville will be the old City
Hall, it looks like a castle.  Skyline wise, look for the maroon and white
(Seventies style) 10-story building and head towards that).

Busses on '66' is located just off of Exit 70 on I-44.  Just follow the
KOA signs.  Phone 1-800-383-5915 for reservations (if you want trees and
hookups).  They are going fast as Hot Rod Nationals is in town the same
weekend.  We will be there Friday and Saturday (pancake breakfast on
Sunday morning).

See you there!
