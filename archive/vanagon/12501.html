&gt;Can someone give me a good explaination as to why Vanagon (and other)
&gt;automatic transmissions dont have a drain plug. Seems it would be a lot

i was told that the reasons were (1) They didn't want the possibility of a
leak (so they put a dozen possibilities around the edge. right.) and (2)
they wanted the gasket changed and filters changed each time the oil was
changed.  this from the automatic repair folks, who would seem to have a
vested interest in such a design.

&gt;big nut on it and installing a drain plug?

i've heard of it being done, but would suggest welding a thick washer on
the backside of the hole before threading for the plug ... just to give
some threads for the plug to grip. i.e., so the threads are in the washer
as well as the thin metal of the cover plate.
