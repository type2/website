&gt;hello, i have come here (once again) seeking knowledge.
&gt;
&gt;the bus has been resting, but the weather is warming.  within
&gt;two weeks i will be swapping motors in my 81(california version), due to
&gt;an as-yet unidentified intermittent-but-mostly-present tweedling/chirping
&gt;sound (on revving/acceleration, and sometimes a constant slow chirp at
&gt;idle) and the availability of a low-cost replacement motor. i wouldn't mind
&gt;diagnosing what the chirping is before i remove the engine, so i can
&gt;fix/rebuild later at leisure.  any ideas?
&gt;
Bad alt. bearing or loose belt?  Something caught in the fan?  Loose spark
plug allowing air to escape?
