&gt;Benifits of P205/70R14 tires:
&gt;  - Improved ride and handling
&gt;  - Longer tread life
&gt;
&gt;Negatives of using P205/70R14 tires:
&gt;  - Heavier steering (if used on front)
&gt;  - More wear a tear on steering gear (if used on front)
&gt;  - Less steering feedback (if used on front)
&gt;  - Reduced traction in snow
&gt;  - Increased unsprung weight
&gt;    - May affect handling
&gt;    - More wear and tear on suspension components
My main goal is to improve ride and handling. The main negative that 
worries me is the wear and tear on the suspension components.
I have one Michelin MXL 205 right now (it's my &quot;spare&quot;), and I believe 
it's the right size with the right characteristics.
