Something to check is the distributor bearings, if they are dry they will 
make the sound you're describing.  Lube these by pulling the cap and 
rotor and put a few drops of oil from the dipstick on the felt pad in the 
middle of the distributor shaft.

As I wrote this I realized that this is for my 77 Rabbit.  I don't know 
whether the same applies to the van engine...duh.  Worth it to check I 
suppose.
