&gt; so let's all be careful out there, and come back again for another year.
&gt; and remember! improperly cooked turkey can make you do the Turkey Trot. :)

and now a word from your Health Department....  cook poultry to an 
internal temperature of 170 F, don't stuff the bird as it slows down 
the heat transfer and creates cool spots.

use a separate cutting board and knife (or just wash them well) for 
raw meat.

the BIGGEST reason some of us will get sick this holiday is because 
Aunt Harriet, who hasn't been feeling well recently, didn't wash her 
hands before buttering her buns.
