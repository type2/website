If you look in the engine compartment there is sticker on the left wall that
will tell you what emissions the car is rigged with,  it will most likely say
for US and CA, definitly for US (which would satisfy the EPA standards
because that is federal)  For CA, I was under the impression if it could pass
smog, it is OK for CA, it does not have to be specified as having CA
emissions, only pass the test.  The CA cars are designed to pass CA, but
other ones can also, I believe.  This is not absolute fact, this is  how it
was described to me.  It is a lot easier to by a car with CA plates!

Good luck, mike d
