Subject: RE: Newly purchased 71 bus

Steve Maher wants more oomph in his new 71.  Get Gene Berg's catalog, which
tells all about his recommendations for Type 1 engines.  I would not go to
the trouble of swapping engines just to move up to a Type 4.  You would need
to do some sheetmetal work, or use an aftermarket upright fan-housing on
the Type 4, as the stock Type 4 fan is behind the engine instead of on top.
