Subject: old bus literature, underbed cargo latchs for 70 pickup, Front engine tin. paint

1)
	I sent off to Walter Miller in New Jersey and got a real
1970 VW Transporter catalog with pictures from Germany and text in
French- multi-page, color, shows pannel vans, pickups, crew-cabs, 
large-bed pickups (Wooden bed and sides with steel-channel frame)
and utility versions with seats or for limosine use.

	The limo picture is really cool- shows a red '70 bus with a
liveried driver (!) and a bunch of business travellers, men and women,
all very european looking, and there the tail of a Cessna in the frame
the way a Cadillac ad would have a 747- it takes a minute to realize
that the big swept tail is in the FOREGROUND and not a much bigger thing
in the background.

2)
	I've just realized that I blew it big-time on my locking
cargo hatches- I drilled out the right side one to get into the 
compartment, but having done that, spoiled the lock cylinder. Well,
a careful exam shows that someone had already drilled out the left
side too- so I've not no intact cylinders. At first I just thought
it had been smashed, but now that one is drilled, I know what that
looks like.
	 Sigh. So I'm looking for one or more 261-829-561C cargo latches 
or at least one intact lock cylinder for same. I'll check, of course, 
to see if the door or other lock cylinder I have is the same, but I 
suspect its a special for the application. Ooops. I may end up with 
a hasp and a pad-lock!

	So let this be a lesson to me- don't destroy things without
making a thorough inspection.

	If anyone knows of a wrecking yard with a 1968-1979 single-cab
pickup, please let me know!

3)
	So here I'm about to put the front engine tin back on (FIF) and
its got 3 round holes in it- one for the fuel line, which should have
a 6mm rubber gromet, part 311 971 913, one for the accelerator cable, which
gets an N 20 092 1 gromet, conduit, and the third doesn't seem to have
any purpose, and gets an N 20 004 1 plug A.

	This is the vertical piece of metal ahead of the fan shroud.

	Have I left anything out?

4) 
	Does anyone on this list live where spray-cans of VW touchup paint
are still available? I'd like to get a couple of cans of Lotus White. I'd
pay for the paint and UPS, and buy you lunch for your trouble. I
don't know where the paint-code sticker is on my pickup- any suggestions?

	Bill
