Subject: chains

Tom: 

My JC Whitney cable chains fit OK but I hate them cuase they are light
weight. The chains to get are those super heavy duty ones in JCW that have
sort of claws welded on. If neccessary, call the JC Whitney tech dept to
find out the cross reference to your tire. Then, be sure you can return to
chains if you find out they are hitting something on your van. Once you have
verified that they don't hit, I'' throw my cable chains in the trash and
order a set myself. :-)

If you are in doubt about which chains to buy you could check with my friend
chrisrosen_at_aol_dot_com who just researched their chains and ordered the heavy
duty models. We've used them before and they are easier than my cable chains
and awsome.
