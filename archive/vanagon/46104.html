&gt; 
&gt; Correction Roy: The VW was the main on base transportation for 
&gt; Australia's research station on Antarctica, because of the air cooling it 
&gt; wouldn't freeze and the rear wheel drive helped for traction in the snow.

That is correct I seem to recall seeing adverts from the 60's touting the 
merits of the beetle back in the 60's.
