Subject: WANTED, FOR SALE, ETC.

	Haven't seen too many &quot;classifieds&quot; here;  hope nobody will 
think me out of order if I post these.
	Need someone to transport 3 Westies from Sacramento area to 
Philadelphia area.  They roll but don't run.
  	Desparately seeking a Vanagon side tent.  I know they are 
rare.  Any leads?  Also need a '63 outside drivers door handle.
	Also, looking to buy any Westies (any year) or split window 
busses. Will consider any condition.
	Lastly, selling a basically rust-free &quot;66 deluxe micro. Also, 
have tons of '75-79 Westy parts for sale, including an air cond.
