Sorry Joel, I should have mentioned that I didn't have time to put them on
the ftp site as well - I didn't think you'd be that interested since you
have already seen the pictures!  I will put them up on bolo in the morning
and reactivate the ftp daemon.  What you attempted to log into was the
ftp support provided by NCSA telnet, which I must have been running at the
time.  It definately does not support anonymous login.  Sorry for the
inconvenience...
