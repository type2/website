&gt;  What better thing to do with a windfall, right? I've ordered new canvas
&gt;  for the pop top and new heater cables. I have no experience installing 
&gt;  either of these items and I'd like to ask the list for advice, things
&gt;  to watch out for, tricks, etc... Has anyone done these tasks with good
&gt;  results?

If your rubber seal around the pop-top is shot, replace it before you do any
work on the canvas.  That way your new tent won't get dirty and if you paint
the top the overspray goes on the old tent.

There are wooden rails impregnated into the fiberglas top.  The top of the tent 
is fastened to them with staples and plastic trim.  At the bottom of the tent you'll 
find aluminum trim and lots (LOTS) of tiny phillips head screws into the metal roof 
of the vehicle.  That's all that holds the canvas tent on. Wear gloves, the staples
are sharp.

I carefully removed the canvas at the bottom first.  All the tiny screws were 
kept in a coffee mug so I wouldn't lose them.  Then I removed the plastic along 
the roofline.  Saved the plastic, threw the staples in the trash.

What was left of the old tent was unstitched and used as a pattern for the new
canvas tent.  I enlisted the help of a sailmaker friend for the sewing.  He used
yellow and tan striped awning canvas.  The only thing he forgot was a zipper in
the rear bug screen to allow access to the luggage rack.  Other than that, it's
as good as the OEM tent.

Installation same as removal.  Tack the top hem of the tent to the wooden rails and
adjust the fit. Lay a piece of the plastic trim over the canvas and wooden rail.
Using a *good* staple gun, staple through the plastic trim and canvas. Put only a few
staples in.  Once that's done, test fit the bottom hem to the roof of the vehicle.
You do not want a really super tight fit so don't worry about pulling the small 
wrinkles out. Put the aluminum trim in place and screw down at each end of the trim.
Put all the remaining aluminum trim in and test opening and closing the pop-top.  
Adjust the fit as required.  Then go back and staple the top hem about every inch or
two.  Put the little phillips head screws in along the bottom hem.

Whlie you're up there working, you may notice that the canvas stretcher needs to be
replaced too.  I found out the hard way:  The canvas ripped and I fell through.  
I was hanging by my legs, upside down with a bump on my head.  Be careful.
