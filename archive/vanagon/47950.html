Subject: Vanagon engine swaps

Gerry:

I am contemplating engine conversions for a Vanagon camper; my 
preference would be a reliable, water-cooled inline or v-style 
powerplant that can be adapted to the VW 4-speed transaxle (I am not 
opposed to installing a Porsche 5-speed).  I want to use the existing 
water heating/cooling hookups on the late model Westfalia.

Are you familiar with anyone who makes conversion kits for anything 
other than a Porsche 911 engine, and what is your opinion of the 
success of such conversions?  

I appreciate any feedback,
