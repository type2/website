Scenario: '82 Oil Burner

So, now that I fixed the Fuel Tank, I have to fix the oil Spewing from 
underneath. My FLAG told me I needed new seals.

Q: Does anybody know what I should expect to pay to have the
   Seals replaced? Since I believe it invovles dropping the tranny,
   I don't think its cheap.

Q2: Does the Diesel have 2 seals? (Front and Rear)

Matthew


P.s. Q3 If the tranny is dropped, should I have the clutch replaced at that
     time? It doesn't *need* a clutch yet though...
