Subject: air-conditioning

Hi guys!
	This may very well be my second post in three months. I just 
bought a '76 camper w/pop-top.  It's my first car and was bought with a 
cross country trip in mind.  But since this is all a little new to me I 
hope you'll bear with the parade naive questions I'm about to ask:
	Is there anyway to get air-conditioning installed in this new 
addition to the family? What are the pros/cons of air-conditioning 
if it's possible?  About how much would the process cost? Where would I go 
to look into this?  Could anyone please offer their wisdom at my address:
tarabah_at_minerva.cis.yale_dot_edu ? (I only get the digest and it will 
probably be a while before the next installment.)
	Thanks so much!
	Good Weather to You All,
		Tara
