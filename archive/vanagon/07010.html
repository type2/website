Subject: Re: anti-theft for diesel vanagons?

re: hostile environment for Mr. Thief.  For those of us whose cars keep coming
back to the same places day after day, I don't like the idea of pissing off
Mr. Thief.  Just because he's a coward doesn't mean he won't hold a grudge,
and take it out some other day on your van or your self.  Steering wheel lock
is boring, but seems a good compromise.  If he breaks the window to find out
your car doesn't start, you're already out $100 and counting.  And if he's
targeting Vanagons, we're not dealing with a rational opponent.
