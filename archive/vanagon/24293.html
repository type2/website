Subject: Re: Brakes inconsistent



&gt; &gt; &gt; My '78 (Murray) is braking rather irregularly these days. After long
&gt; &gt; &gt; highway sections (infrequent braking) the brake pedal sinks rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; close to the floor without producing much stopping power. The problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; is resolved after a pump or two when brake pressure is returned.
&gt;
&gt; snip...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Mark, have you been losing brake fluid?  Any wetness anywhwere in the
&gt; &gt; braking system that might indicate a leak in the system?  Wheel
&gt; &gt; cylinders, master cylinders, couplings in the lines?


I just replaced the (leaking) master cylinder on my '71, which is rather
a different creature than your '78. But guess what I found-- the vacuum
servo for the power brakes (master cyl bolts to it) was COMPLETELY FULL
of old, grungy-looking brake fluid. We're talking like a quart or two here.

This bus (got it recently) must have been losing brake fluid for a LONG
time, without any ever showing up on wheels, master cyl or servo exterior,
or any place else-- until the engine started blowing out vast clouds of
opaque, white smoke.

Something you might want to check.
