I do believe (not a chrysler endorsment) that the average VW owner is
mor likely to take your advice and &quot;fix little things before they become 
big things&quot; than any big-3-buy-amerikan drivers (or most).

As a point of interest, the makers of our beloved Syncro Vanagons now
make Chrysler mini-vans (and Jeep Grand Cherokees).  I don't know if
S/D/P still makes the Syncro Transporters for those lucky places where
you can buy them.

I have never been convinced, in 20-odd years of driving VW's and another
20 in riding in them that they are more reliable, better built, cheaper parts.
I like them, but it's an attitude thing.  My busses (got 3 that run) fail
me far more often than my Acura Legend.  I am more amazed when they *don't*
fail in some small (or large) way on any given trip.  My old split went 
through *many* engines -- can't recall how many (lost count).  I carried
a *spare engine* sometimes!  Mine typically shedded parts on the road, too,
but they were usually oily, metal bits instead of plastic license-plate frames.

Other than bakelite, I can't recall any plastic on the bus, come to think of
it.  Maybe it shed it all before I got it.  Speaking of shedding bits: How
many times have you seen a singlecab with the original side-door lock covers?
How about the engine lid lock cover?  More often than not?  Didn't think so.
I know we're talking 40-year-old bus instead of 10, but I got my singlecab
25 years ago -- it was only 15 at the time, but ALL those bits were gone,
along with many of the little rubber bumpers (and the rear bumper), etc.

Take car of any car, and it will live better.  I think there were less VW
lemons than most makers, and somebody somewhere must still drive them Foxes
and 411's...
