Subject: Re: Fuel System Missing

To whom ever can assist,
I have a 86 westi, it works great except for an annoying miss, like the fuel
had just been cutoff, or a plug miss fired.  It doesn't happen every time I
drive it.  But when it does, it seems as though for a 5 or 6 seconds like its
running out of gas, and the van is coming to a halt. It generally happends in
the first 10 miles of highway driving then usually never happends again.  The
local VW shop replaced the throttle switch  the last time and the first time
they put in a new wiring harness on the air cleaner that was supposed to take
out the static electricity and the electric peaks. I have replaced the spark
plug wires, plugs and installed a new fuel filter before any of the
previously mentioned work.  I don't want to take it in again before I have
some sort of Idea what might be the problem.  Any assistance is appreciated.
Thanks
