&gt; I have what I hope is a quick little question.  I have a 009 dist on 
&gt; my otherwise stock 71 bus.  I hope I am right here:  there are two 
&gt; tubes coming out of the carb that I assume were for the stock dist.  
&gt; The PO 'plugged' these by putting a small section of rubber hose over 
&gt; each and then plugging the end of that hose with a screw.  In my 
&gt; never ending search to my idleing problems I was going to replace 
&gt; these and hope that it fixes what acts like an air leak.  Any ideas on
&gt; the best way to do this?  Thanks, Jim

There are little rubber caps for this purpose.  I don't know where to
buy them but I usually get them from the junkyard.  I was never ever able
to get my engine to idle smoothly with the 009.  As soon as I put my
stock dual diaphragm distributor back in and hooked up the vacuum lines,
it purred like a kitten.  Why don't you try using an original-equipment
distributor and see if the idle improves?  Just a thought...
