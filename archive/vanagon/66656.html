Subject:      Fw: Bus sighting!

Hitchcock always seems to have a bunch of vdubs in the background of his
films.  Oh, and what about Field of Dreams? Kevin Costner even had a full
length roof rack on his loaf! Oh, and how about Fast Times at Ridgemont High
when Spicolli spills out of the smoke filled splitty? Better stop, those are
just off the top of my head...
