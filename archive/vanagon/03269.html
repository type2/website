&gt;So much for uniqueness bringing vw people together.

yeah, that's been the response i have observed as well. but i think it is
because of the mentality of the folks who bought the buses as just 'vans',
and not as VW's. there's a very subtle difference there, and perhaps these
are the people who actively seek out the caravan: the non-wavers.

but then, maybe it's just the Time and Current Political Climate ... cause i
don't see even beetle drivers waving at each other. the only folks i see
doing any recognition on the highway are small british convertible drivers
and big truck drivers.

i remember once, a very long time ago, on a trip to florida (waaaay back
before the interstates), we were in a beetle and caught up with another
beetle. so we slowed down and ran along. in the space of about an hour, two
more beetles caught up and we all ran along together. talk about some strange
looks from other people! :)  after another 30 minutes or so, somebody turned
off and we began to break up the convoy, but it was really neat to see beetles
in front and beetles behind.

sigh.
