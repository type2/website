Subject: Wanted,machanic,seattle area,works cheap

I have 84 vanagon and want to change the front heating core.  I need to
change the back too but that's easy enough to do myself.  I hear the front
is not so easy and it might be better to have someone do it that knows what
they're doing.
I have little heat come out the front and it's not constent.  The back blows
a little hotter but it's in addiquit too.  They both smell or coolant and I
know thats not good.  I've done alot of trouble shooting with no prevail.
Like flushing the system and pressure testing for leaks.  I need a machanic
that knows what there doing so I can get other fixed problems too.  
thank you 
Fred
