interesting translation.....

Anyway - you're probably talking about the turn sig./foglight assembly
available from Oettinger.  Zender carries them too. ( both the aforementioned
are German &quot;tuners&quot; or automotive accesory houses.)
I believe Coyote has a set of these on his Westy.
-must add - there is some cutting of sheetmetal to install, and once you've
installed them, there's no going back....
look sharp, tho...
