Subject: steering wheel cover

Vanagoners:

	I need to take the cover plate off the front of my steering wheel to
re-glue to vinyl; it's starting to come loose around the upper and lower
edges. Bentley says just pull it off. It doesn't come with mild pulling,
thought I'd ask the list for encouragement before really pulling hard on
it.
	Thanks.
