&gt; Others probably have more information on this, but the heads with hydraulic
&gt; valves require a different pushrod, which means putting in a crank from a 
&gt; '78-'79.  Or maybe it was just the hydraulic lifters that needed the different
&gt; length/diameter/whatever pushrods.
&gt; 
&gt; Or so I was told when I my '76 was rebuilt.

   I think David Schwarze is the authority on this conversion. What I've heard
   it involves is: Camshaft, Lifters, Pushrods, and a subtle change to the
   rocker gear that I don't quite remember (sorry).
