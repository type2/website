&gt;Gee, Steve, why don't you just call me &quot;faggot?&quot;

        Hey, Gerry, I thought you kicked Martino off the list... Ooops,
sorry, guess he's not the guy escalating things this time.

        Umm, here's a concept. Let's all have a good laugh, pour a beer,
and grow up, eh? I finished up with name calling in the 10th grade, and I'm
on this list for VW content. A little humor is good, name calling can be
done in private. Remember the old saying, &quot;opinions are like A**holes,
everyone has 'em and they all stink&quot;? Think about it next time before you
start pulling this crap. And flame each other on your own time, I'm not
interested.

        Now getting off soapbox and donning flame retardent clothing...

Peace,
