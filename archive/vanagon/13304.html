Subject:       Re: Tight Suspension...Too tight!

&gt; The Question:  Is there something else to adjust!?  
&gt; 
&gt; Question #2:  The bus has a sway bar.  I noticed my friends '66 and other
&gt; friends '64 don't.  Is this aftermarket?  Would it make the suspension _that_
&gt; much tighter.
&gt; 
&gt; Question #3:  What are your busses like out there?  Am I just whiney?
&gt; 
  I have a '66 camper and a had '67 camper and the 
difference in front suspension is like night and day.  
The '67 had a sway bar and rides real smooth (for a bus).  
The '66 has tired front torsion bars and rides real hard.  
I've rebuilt the link and king pin front end and it helped 
quite a bit, but it still rides hard.  As far as I know 
there are no adjustments that can be made on the front 
torsion bars, and I haven't seen any aftermarket adjusters 
for the bus either. 
    Since I can't seem to find a good used set of torsion 
bars, I've thought about removing the torsion bars and 
flipping them right to left and reinstalling them so they 
would twist in the opposite direction and lift the front up 
a bit. (I'm not sure if this would work?)
    I've been trying to get ahold of the KYB technical 
hotline to see if they have any coil-over shocks that might 
fit on the front end as this seems like it would be the 
easiest and/or least cost solution.  I've only seen them 
advertised for the rear of the bug.  I'll let you know what 
I find.
