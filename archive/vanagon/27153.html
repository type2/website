Subject: Engine transplant

I have an '88 Vanagon with leaky headgaskets - (water).  I'm thinking about
transplanting to a V6 (watercooled) or larger.  I don't think that I want to
go the 6 cylinder, air-cooled  Porsche route. Has anyone had any experience
with this kind of undertaking?  What are the major problems?  I'd appreciate
any feedback.
