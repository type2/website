Subject: Winni-EV Hatch Screens

I was delighted to find out that the Winni-EV's include a Rear Hatch screens
that allows the area under the hatch to be used as an under cover storage/
camping area. I was wondering on how these screens attach to the hatch and
whether I could upgrade my Westy-EV-MV with these screens?  

Are they just screens or are there curtains also?
Is there a floor?

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,
