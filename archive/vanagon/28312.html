Subject: Air conditioner

I just picked up a 78 Westfalia that is becoming my winter project 
 (much work), and it has a complete factory AC unit with about a mile 
 of hoses and a set of monstrous radiator things(evaporators?). I am 
 going to pull this out and never put it back when the paint work is 
 done, so if anybody is interested please drop me a line and tell me if 
 it is worth anything, I am not looking to make big $$$ on the deal.

Clay

PS I also have a Stewart Warner gas heater of questionable condition 
 from a 69 westy that needs a home.
