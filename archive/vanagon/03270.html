Subject: Re:  Grateful Dead in Boston...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ok, so this is only tangentally related to vanagons...or Typ 2s.....
&gt; &gt; but what the hell....anyone know when the Dead is playing in 
&gt; &gt; Boston Garden this year??
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ric
&gt; I believe it's in October. Check out rec.music.gdead. At least once a
&gt; week someone posts confirmed tour dates. Not a bad newsgroup...
&gt; 

rec.music.gdead is much too busy though, unlike this group. :-&gt;
