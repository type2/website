There will be ETKA products demonstrated at the National Automobile Dealer
Association convention in Las Vegas early February at the ADP Booth. 
Sharp-eyed individuals will spot me there.

(No, I'm not going to be demonstrating anything, I'm one of the guys that
makes the lights flash.)

At any rate, ETKA products will be shown alongside ADP's other automated
parts catalog offerings.
