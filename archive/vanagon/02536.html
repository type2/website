&gt;&gt;Has anyone else out there heard that westy's in the US are prone
&gt;&gt;to tipping to the left on left turns because of so much of the weight
&gt;&gt;of these things being on the left side of the van (kitchen, etc.)?

I thought you were talking about the infamous instances of fraternity members
tipping over unsuspecting Vanagons late at night!
