Howdy there, how ar things in Illinois? We passed through twice, on the way to
and from Indianapolis, but we were down in the southern part of the state.
Anyway, just wondering how you were coming with that camper? The engine, the
whole reason I got it in the first place, supposedly brand new, that I got with
it blew up in New Mexico. Not only was the &quot;new&quot; case already bored out twice,
but the case sealant was blocking up a couple key oil galleys, so the #3 rod
bearing started to seize. However, I knew Tom of NEATO in Albuquerque, so he
hooked us up with another NEATO'er, and within a couple days we were back on
the road. Anyway, I hope all is well with you.
