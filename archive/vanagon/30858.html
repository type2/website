I suppose I'd go along with this.  I've been pulled over at least once
a year in my various busi for the last ten years, never when using a
non-VW vehicle (motorcycle, generic sedan, etc).  At least locally,
what seems to happen is that they look closer at VWs to see if there's
something they might want to pull me over for.  They've always had a
legitimate excuse, but it's been kind of contrived at times (such as
failing to signal a lane change).  What's interesting is that they've
never asked to search the vehicle, or anything like that.  Must be
that clean police record, combined with looking relatively respectable
(although you'd think the beard would counteract that).

Oh yeah, relative driving amounts are approximately equal between the
busi and the other vehicles, so it's not a statistical anomaly caused
by predominantly using one vehicle over another.
