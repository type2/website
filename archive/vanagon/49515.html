Subject: Data requested from 1991 Vanagon owners

Hi All,
I am compiling a description of USA Vanagons for the model year 1991 and
would like
to inlcude the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) for the vans and
all of the options.  If anyone has an original window sticker or other
reliable price data, I'd love to hear from you.

I do have the standard 1991 Vanagon brochure.

Also, I have not been able to confirm the existence (or non-existence) of a
1991 Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition.  If anyone has a 1991 Vanagon Wolfsburg
Edition (or a 1991 Wolfsburg brochure), I'd really appreciate hearing about
it.

Thank you very much,

Jim Davis
