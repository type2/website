Subject: Head temp sensor



Hi, does anybody know the best/cheapest way to get a new temp sensor 
for the head of 2.0 L air cool 1981 vanagon (left side near the front of the
head)? I put the old one back in and hav an alligator clip in the remnants
of the broken wire sticking out. This is barely functional and prone
to dying on the highway without warning when the clip comes off.
Bad for tunnels... VW wants $31. Mail-order is fine, otherwise PA, WV, MD
are OK. THanks.
