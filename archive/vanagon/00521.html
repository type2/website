&gt; But solar cells aren't very cost effective right now.  If you want a 1 
&gt; amp (12 watts) cell, it'll cost about $80-100.  Suppose you needed an 
&gt; extra 15 amps.... I think the costs would be prohibitive.  Also alot of 
&gt; space would be needed, and sun shine. :)

True, but I think an output of two amps would be helpful, because while
a fridge draws around 4 amps, it is only on for about half of the time
(more in warm, less in cold) so you might come close to breaking even,
at least in the daytime.  That would be really nice.  If I could get a 25
watt panel for $100 I would do it.

&gt; OTOH, for that same $100 dollars, you could get the 70 amp alternator.  
&gt; Or for about $150, a 100 amp alternator.  If yo only had the stock 50 amp 
&gt; alt. then you would have gained 50 amps.  How much would it cost to get 
&gt; that kind of increase from solar cells?

Just a minor point... my alternator is a 55 amp, not 50.
