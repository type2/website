&gt; Someone, I think it was Joel, recently posted some names of companies that
&gt; might stock '81 Vanago speedometer/odometers.  After much dissection of the
&gt; beast I think we are about to give up on it and VW says the replacement
&gt; from them will cost $250!!!  Please repost/post any information you all
&gt; have about buyin replacment speedo/odos.

  Howdy Alice,

  The odometer started hanging up in my '74 about 5 years ago. This was a real
  problem for me since the fuel gauge sender had died long before and I was
  using the odo to keep track of when to get gas. I took it apart and it was
  the little white gear that had cracked as we have heard mentioned here on 
  the list before. 
&gt; 
&gt; I went to one of those &quot;Pick your Part&quot; junkyards and pulled speedometer 
  units out of buses AND took them apart until I found one without a broken
  gear. They only charged me $10.00 or so for the good unit and it has
  been working well now for about 45,000 miles.

  Dealer prices for that type of item a pretty outrageous. 


  Good Luck - I thought the junkyard trip was kinda fun too.
