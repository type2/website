Martha Rubin sez:

&gt;OK, &quot;guys,&quot; if some of you intend NOT to shower, I'm going to be
&gt;forced to divide our camping area into two categories.  The
&gt;group that showers is going to get the chili, margaritas,
&gt;tequila shots, and cornbread.  Have fun, the &quot;rest&quot; of you!  ;0

EuroLarry responds:

A few more comments on &quot;the shower thing&quot;...

1) I didn't know there was a vaccine for tequila available.  Could be a
useful preventative measure for the dreaded worm in the bottle hangover.

2) Being Euro is cool and sophisticated, not itchy and steenky.  (Although,
now that I think about it, I'm still scratching from the poison oak on our
second last hike.)

3) Since Alice and I are making the corn bread, you SQUEEKY CLEAN types
better watch out!  I might just forget to wash my hands before baking.  The
more water you use, the more I will have to conserve to make up for it.  :)
