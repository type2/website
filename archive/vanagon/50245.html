Subject: Re: Brake fluid servicing

The reason for replacing brake fluid is because brake fluid absorbs water
from the air. But you're also right on the second part, many cars go to
their grave with original brake fluid in them. So who who's right. I always
flush mine when I'm doing brakes even if I'm not doing any hydraulic
repairs. But realisticaly this is every 5 years or so.
