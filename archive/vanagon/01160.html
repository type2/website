yeah but if you buy the socket it will be 'free' when the other
side goes :-)

not knowing synchros, you might want to check the bentley to see
what is involved withthis job - if you need a good press you might
want to take off the hub and take it to a good auto machine
shop and have then do the press off - press on bit.

sometimes if you build a relationship with a mechanic  you can borrow or
rent a big socket for a weekend - for a case of beer or less - i like
doing things like this as its fun to make deals with people if yuo
look at it the right way. if you bust it, you had better replace it to
their specs out of good karma, be forewarned...
