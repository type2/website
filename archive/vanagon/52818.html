I don't think Ron was joking.  I also think he's right, to a certain extent.

(step up.....)

I agree, in part, to what he was saying and I am very distrustful of
televangelists, in general.  I have lived near the two televangelist capitals
of the world (Charlotte, NC and Colorado Springs, CO), and I am sickened by
their presence in our society.  They don't report and are not held accountable
for the dispersement of funds received as donations.  Donations are tax
deductible, so people are a little bit unencumbered to open up their pocket
books.  In a way, our government subsidized this HUGE industry.  Why?  Under
the guise of righteousness?  That's a crock!

I wouldn't give aid to an evangelist, but if you can give aid to some children
in a developing nation, you should think about it.

I think the appropriate question to ask is what is the nature of the
relationship between the High School and the mission.

If the school is not part of the mission, then I think it may be a worthy
cause.

Even if it is, it still may be worthy cause, who can say?  I think we all need
to be aware of our impact on developing countries.  Be careful who you support.
 Be certain you are supporting what you think you are.

I don't think that the Mission is there for the sole purpose of humanitarian
aid to a developing nation.  That mission is there for the purpose of seeking
conversions to the Catholic faith.  That may not be a bad thing, but it is
certainly an erosion of the indigenous Belizian culture.  The church is
certainly not the only culprit to such a travesty.  We are all probably to
blame, including the Belizian people themselves.  We tour Belize to go scuba
diving and sea kayaking, and dump cash into and economy which relies almost
entirely on tourism.  Locals cannot support the kind of lifestyle they see
Tourists live, yet they want what the see us have.  It is truly a sad sight to
behold.

Whatever your religous beliefs, human society as a whole needs to foster deep
admiration and respect for the few cultures lucky enough to know their
heritage, and do everything in their power to help them maintain that heritage.
I believe that is far more valuable a goal.

(step down)

I said too much.  Sorry, this thread should probably be taken off line.
