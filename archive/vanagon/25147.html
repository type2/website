&gt;I know of at least one person that took a Unimaug chassis and put it 
&gt;under a (insert generic American car maker, I don't remember)  van body!
&gt;Shoulda seen him trying to regiater that in California.   

My brother used to own an ex-army forward control LandRover. It was about
the size of a bus and the driver sat over the front wheels, just like a bus.
It used to be an ambulance and he used it as a camper on climbing trips. It
had no overhang front or rear, about 2 feet of ground clearance, 16 forward
gears and could drive up the side of a house. The body just unbolts so with
a bus body and bit of imagination you could have the ultimate off-road camper. 
BTW, it was even slower than my bus but *nobody* cuts you up or tailgates
when you drive something that looks like a prop from Mad Max.
