Subject: A sharp metallic SNAP...

It is the stabilizer link...  I had to replace this on my '82 Diesel.

81 thru Nov. '84 use the same part.  After that, it is a different
part...

They can be re-cycled, if you find one in a junkyard.  Also, left or
right does not matter.

If you remove the broken piece (so you do not harm aything else) you
can drive the vanagon.  Handling will be much worse.

Good luck,
Cetin

 &gt; What broke is a short (10 in.) S-shaped vertical rod in front of the coil 
 &gt; spring....doesn't seem to be a part of the primary suspension, no is the 
 &gt; steering affected.  I'm guessing the thing it attaches to at the top is a sway
