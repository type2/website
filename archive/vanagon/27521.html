&gt;      Here is a compilation of the data I have collected, some
&gt;      of it posted earlier.
&gt;
&gt;      First, here's how the factory endowed water cooled Vanagons look:
&gt;
&gt;      Engine         HP:SAE_at_RPM    Torque:FTLB_at_RPM     Notes
&gt;
&gt;      2.1l           90_at_4800           117_at_3200        Slow
&gt;      1.9l           82_at_4800           105_at_2600        Slower
&gt;      Diesel         48_at_4200            97_at_2000        Slowest
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;      Here are some practical(?) options among 5cyl VW/Audi Engines:
...

Don't forget the 6-cylinder version of the VAG engine! It is being used in
the LT series trucks in Europe, and also in diesel form in the mid '80s
Volvo in NA.

The 4 and 5-cylinder engines have different face plates to my best knowledge,
so you can not just bolt up a 5 in place of the 4-cyl. The 5 and 6-cylinder
engines are identical.

Do the wasserboxers have the same bolt pattern as the  watercooled VW
engines? What about the aircooled Vanagons? Do they use different
trnasmissions and/or bellhousings for the aircooled/wasserboxer/diesel?
