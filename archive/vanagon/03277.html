&gt; &gt;Ummm... that's cause the Eurovan is the only minivan made in Europe.  At
&gt; &gt;least the only mainstream one.  Of course it's going to sell well there.

&gt; 
&gt; What makes it a 'minivan' rather than plain 'van'? There are dozens of 
&gt; similar vehicles around in Europe. Fiat, Citroen, Renualt, Ford, and (soon) 
&gt; GM all make similar vans. 

The difference is that the others are not meant as passenger vans.  They are
(with possibly an exception here and there) sold as delivery vans.  At least
that's how it was the last time I was there (1990).
