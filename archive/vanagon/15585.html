This all has me wondering again, would it be a good
idea on Wasserboxers to occasionally, say every 15,000
retorque the head bolts like you would on an air
cooled?  Seems like an ounce of prevention and a few
valve cover gaskets would certainly be worth the chore,
but can you get to the uppers without pulling the engine?
It's been a while since I've worked on a Wasserboxer and
don't remember but since there is no cooling tin and it
pretty much just sits ther in the open, seems like an easy
enough thing to do.
