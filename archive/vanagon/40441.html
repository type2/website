Subject: Re: '73 Westy Questions ('72 comparisons)




&gt; Not sure if it changed for the '73... 

nope it changed in 74. the interiors for 73 and 72 are very similiar except 73's 
often got the uglier (IMHO) &quot;darker&quot; woodgrain and sometimes i have seen cabinet 
handles that were white as opposed to the standard black

 
&gt; Other than these points they matched.  Was the '73 the first year the pop 
&gt; top opened with a rear hinge? 

nope 74' was
