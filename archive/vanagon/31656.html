Subject: Power brake booster on Type II

Hi, I want to introduce myself and my VW's to the lists and ask a question.  
I'm 28, and I've been a Vintage VW owner for about 2 years, but an admirer 
of vintage vw's much longer than that.  I currently own a '57 oval window, 
completely stock except syncro tranny and a '64 crew cab pickup, lowered 
with fake porsche alloys and 1641cc DP.  I'm currently working on putting 
retractable shoulder belts in the '57 and installing the lowered bus 
spindles from wolfgang international on the '64.  I want to do away with 
using the bus boys 'albatross' adjustable front end.  I'm also doing a 
complete overhaul on the brake system.  I've just re-finished the front 
brake backing plates and drums, the spindles are already painted, bought new 
wheel cylinders, bearings and new rubber brake hoses.  This thing should 
stop on a dime when I'm done...  But especially since...

And maybe someone could help me out here, I'm going to retro-fit the brake 
booster servo and master cylinder from a '71 vintage vanagon.  I've already 
purchased the servo (yow! that was expensive!) the master cylinder and 
vacuum line check valve.  I figure I'll have to fabricate and mig weld a 
special bracket to mount the booster/master cylinder assembly and then run a 
vacuum line to the engine compartment.  I plan to use copper tubing, cause 
it does'nt rust and is available!  I have a question though, does anyone 
know why there seems to a second vacuum line connection on the brake 
booster, right where the operating rod from the brake pedal goes into the 
brake booster?  This is in addition to the vacuum connection thats on the 
large round housing of the booster where vacuum is usually connected.

I know some of you vanagon owners must the answer to this one.  Also, has 
anyone else done this retro-fit conversion before?  Any comments or ideas 
are much appreciated.  TIA
