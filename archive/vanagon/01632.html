&gt; When I got my '78, it needed new headers &amp; heater boxes. after pricing 
&gt; them _at_ VW I went searching junk yards.  Found an intact '78 engine for 
&gt; $200.  Bought it, took the exhaust system  &amp; stowed the block for a rainy 
&gt; day.  Four years later, I'm still dry (except for my parents tears for 
&gt; crapping up their garage).  In order to cause complete engine failure in 
&gt; my (currently functional &amp; just flew through the emission inspecion) bus, 
&gt; I am offering this block for $100.  The only guarantee I can offer is 
&gt; that I see no holes in the block, so I presume it is rebuildable.  It may 
&gt; be brand new for all I know (which ain't much, but I doubt it).  It is 
&gt; located in Springfield, VA.  Please reply to:

I am very interested in this... but I am in San Diego.  Do you think it would
be possible to ship it?  I know that UPS will ship packages over 100 pounds
now.  I would of course pay for shipping too.  Does it include the entire
engine, i.e. pistons, liners, and heads?  If so, I will take it, sight
unseen.  Please let me know... my 1800 is getting tired :)
