Subject: Ever replace the gasket in the big sunroof?
Date: Fri, 11 Apr 1997 18:36:37 -0700


I have an '85 Weekender. The sunroof leaks. Before I tape the seam up, I'd
like to try replacing the gasket.

I bought replacement gasket material from a dealer.

What adhesive did you use? 

Any tricks?

Thanks for any help.
