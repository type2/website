Joel,

This is another of those silly ideas that, while it sounds good is simply too
impractical to catch on.  Consider how much printer-time it would take to
create one of these things and how much it would weigh.  Plus, it would
constitute a fire hazard, being made entirely of paper.  

No, I'm afraid this is another idea destined for the dust bin.  People will
continue to not absorb information via computer, the way God intended.
