More Leaky Headgasket Q's
Howdy,

Unfortunately it looks like my '88 Westie has begun the leaky head gasket
shuffle at around 88k miles.  I'm playing phone tag with the VWoA rep.

Does anyone have any advice on how to best deal with the nice folks at
Volkswagon of America?  What's up with the Federal Trade Commission and VW?  I
looked on the FTC's web (www.ftc_dot_gov) server and found nothing to do with VW.

I read Fred Porter's and Scott Sminkey's posts about good experiences with VWoA.
 Suggestions Fred, Scott?

My parent's 90 Westie is beginning to leak as well, so I'm getting ready to really
get to know the 'system'.

Replies back to my email as well as posts to the list would be greatly
appreciated,

Kirk out
