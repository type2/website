Subject: re: Bentley &quot;deal&quot;

8-1/4&quot; x 11-5/8&quot;; $79.95 plus $7 shipping. (Canada airmail: add $10

plus 35-40% exchange = $120+  !!!

The FLAPS store here (Bow Wow Parts) has them for $91 CDN...

ps: I have a Bentley Rabbit/Scirocco I (gas only) manual if anyone's 
interested for $15 + shipping. (For an extra $485 I'll throw in a 
slightly bent, but good running '82 Scirocco too...)

Shawn.
