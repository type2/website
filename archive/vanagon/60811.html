Subject: Show in Minneapolis June 8th

Anyone else going to the show in Minneapolis on June 8th? Type2 listmember
Nate Dennison and I are hoping to go (provided his '81 Westy doesn't give
us any trouble like it did the last two times we tried to use it for
something big) and are always interested in meeting more listmembers. Drop
me a line if you're going!

P.S. I'll bring along CD's of the original songs used for my parodies if
anyone would like to hear what they sound like...
