Subject: Re: Thermostat/Too cool

&gt;If a new thermostat does not work you can return it to the dealer. They have
&gt;been making too much $$$ from all of us anyway. Good luck

           For a similar situation, my friend is replacing his GM/Pontiac's
           MacPherson struts. The rubber bearings cost more than the struts.
