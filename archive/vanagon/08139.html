&gt; It runs fine.  (Except on cold mornings, but that's the carb and
&gt; another long story.)  Gets up hills with all the power one could
&gt; expect in a bus.  Runs hot, gets poor mileage, but probably not
&gt; unreasonably so.  So the questions are: are these compression numbers
&gt; very, very bad, and is there anything to worry about?  

I certainly wouldn't worry about it.  My bus (73 1800) has similar
numbers and like yours, it has been that way since I rebuilt it.  As
long as they are near the same, I don't think it's a problem.  I
attributed mine to having used all low-compression parts (i.e. dished
pistons. non-milled heads) because I have seen what detonation can do
to aluminum heads, and I am scared to death of it.  It's probably just
the result of a low compression ratio motor.

&gt;							  The engine
&gt; might come out soon so that I can get some transmission work done --
&gt; would there be any point to tearing into the engine while it's on the
&gt; porch?  What kind of compression numbers do the rest of you (with the
&gt; type 4 engines) get?

If you have a lot of time on your hands, it wouldn't hurt to pull the
heads and make sure your valves are in good shape and not leaking.  I
would take the heads into a machine shop and hav them pressurize the
combustion chamber and check for leaky valves.  Just my 2 cents...
