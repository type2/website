I have always gotten 18-20 mpg.  Speed and/or use of A/C has never made
much difference.  Here, being North of Philadelphia, the oxygenated gas in
use during winter will drop mileage by 2 mpg.  I always figured the main
influence on MPG for the vanagon, is strictly the resistance of moving that
box through air!
