&gt;&gt;OK, so I got ahold of the guy and it turns out:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* It's a '70, not a '71.
&gt;&gt;* It's got a Corvair engine in it. 
&gt;&gt;* &quot;Ran fine 2 years ago when I last ran it&quot;
&gt;&gt;* Body is said to be good. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Now how much would you pay?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;At this point, I'm thinking. This is actually the second week it's
&gt;&gt;been in the paper; he didn't think it would be selling soon. I'll
&gt;&gt;prolly take a look and then pass on it (and pass his # on), I dunno.
&gt;&gt;Apparently it's got the bus tranny, but with the ring gear flipped
&gt;to
&gt;&gt;make it go backwards for the corvair engine.  Any feedback on how
&gt;hard
&gt;&gt;that would be to undo?
&gt;&gt;

&gt;Well, if the engine is out of a spyder, ie. the 4 (!) carb model, the
&gt;engine 
&gt;has 140 _stock_ HP.  That is an awfull lot of ponies.  Recently, a
&gt;guy who 
&gt;had a 59 willy's jeep told me that corvair parts are still available.
&gt;He 
&gt;mentioned that you had to wait for them, but you can still get them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Idunno how hard it is to undo the ring gear, it would be easier to
&gt;just swap 
&gt;the tranny's.  While your there, make sure to add a front beam of a
&gt;73' and 
&gt;later to stop all of those ponies. :-).  Sure a 71 beam would do, as
&gt;well, 
&gt;but the 73's have bigger calipers.
&gt;
&gt;If I was in cali, I would be all over it.

Parts ARE available! You might have to hook up with someone from CORSA
(CORvair Society of America) to be able to find very many, though.  On
horsepower, even the lowest hp version with two carbs had 110 stock, but the
REAL hp was from the Corsa.  It was a 3 barrel carb with a turbo that made
180 stock HP.  Don Yenko, of Yenko Chevrolet that was in Cannonsburg, PA,
modified some for sale through his dealership that put out 250hp.  This is
from a 165 cid flat 6.

Still don't think I would want another Corvair, though.
