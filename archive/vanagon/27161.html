Subject: parting out '78 camper bus
Date: 20 Oct 1995 01:04:38 -0600

I'm parting out my '78 camper bus. Just about everything is
available except some engine parts and the transmission. I'm
less worried about getting a good deal than seeing that good
things are being re-used. Engine is 2-liter fuel-injected, btw.
Car is located in Denver. e-mail me at
sosborn_at_du_dot_edu
Thanks!
