Subject: Window removal procedure

Hello, again.  As I proceed to prepare Lazarus for a paint job and possible
body work I am again stumped by how to remove the windows.  The rubber is
trashed so keeping it is not really a problem but nonetheless I would like
to know the 'real' way to get good windows out in one piece.

The Bible seems to imply that I should have a professional do that.  Not to
blaspheme but the whole reason was to avoid the pros as much as possible.

Thanks again and, just think, after all is said and done I may be able to
ANSWER some questions! :-)
