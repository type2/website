I have been using Castrol Syntec in my 83 vanagon since the engine was rebuilt
in the spring 91.  My engine seems to run smoother and starts are much
better in cold weather.  I do continue to change the oil around every
3000 miles and much prefer the VW oil filters (expensive) to all others.
Just my two cents.
