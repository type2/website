&gt; If you do suspect your engine is too hot, and decide to stop, do you turn it
&gt; off, or let it idle so the fans keep blowing air over it?

I notice that if I shut my bus off immediately after it's been pushed
hard that the CHT skyrockets.  The temp goes up so fast I can see the
needle move.  Scary.  So, I always sit for about 30 seconds with the
engine at fast idle (2500 RPM) to let it cool off if it's been driven
hard.  Seems to keep the CHT from spiking like that.

&gt; My fatherinlaw, a long time bug driver (like from the early(?) forties
&gt; in the German army (something called a kubbelwagon) ;-))
&gt; still lifts the hood on his Pasat at the end of and long trip
&gt; to &quot;let the engine cool off&quot;. Is this an ex-aircooled habit that was 
&gt; necessary at some point? He is alway telling my I should open the engine
&gt; door on my van to let it cool off after any trip of more than 30minutes.

Lots of drag racers do this at the track.
