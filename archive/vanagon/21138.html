&gt; &gt; Is it worth the effort to replace my incandescent interior light with one 
&gt; &gt; of the fancy-dancy flourescents? I imagine the power drain would be 1/3 
&gt; &gt; to 1/4 of the little heater in there now. Caveats anyone?

flat out, no.  several reasons... first and foremost in  my mind is 
light quality.  i had the flourescent in my '85 and incandescent in 
the '87.  with the fl. light, everyone looked dead, it was VERY slow 
to start in winter (a relative term i understand), and hummed a 
little.  the incand. light is warm (makes one want to fool around and 
for that reason alone is worth it!!:), starts instantly, and has easy 
to find replacement bulbs.

a small fl. light will 'cost' about 8 watts power, same as the 
incandescent.  the 'efficiency' comes from that it produces more 
light for the 8 watts.  keep the incandescent, the extra light is not 
needed.  there are available 100ma 12v  LED lights for lighting 
engine compartments, walk-ways etc on boats.  they are a super bright 
output and while not usable for reading, etc. may serve to fill in 
the 'gaps'.  they come in red or green.  i think i need one or two :)

nautical supply places like West Marine, have a wonderful assortment 
of lights for boats and VWs.  the two really are the same, ya know.
i have no idea why i want this but sometime i'll install the nautical 
cabin light in the Westy that switches to red with the flick of a 
switch...
