Had the chatter clip for the clutch cable break on the way to work one 
morning and coasted into a pay-parking slot. Managed to convince meter 
guy not to ticket me. Overalls came in handy...morons made me nervous, 
even with ALL of me underneath. Once I had cars parked front and behind, 
I was alright. It was near a bus stop though...got lots of funny looks as 
I slid under, out for tools, then back under. Would have liked to have 
some fake dynomite to look like a real commando. 8) Joe
