Subject:      Looking for alloy wheels?

Greetings
On saturday I drove 350miles in Vermont and New Hampshire: a fall foliage
trip?  No.  Looking for a set of vanagon alloys.  I was told that they were
pristine and covered with a set of reinforced tires with only 3.5k on them.
Price; 600 for the wheels and 250 for the tires.  Well, I was keen.  I
headed down
with all those images in my head of those westys and tristars (in GASS and
LIMBO missives) with these wheels.  Then, I saw them;
Greyish, wet, rusty lug nuts, gouges, scratches, no lug bolts, wheel weights
fallen off etc  compared to most of the stuff around- a very unattractive wheel.
What is the point of buying an alloy wheel that doesn't look good?
This was a real wake up call for me regarding &quot;carat alloys&quot;  There are
other wheels available.
If you are dying for a set - caveat emptor
Tony
