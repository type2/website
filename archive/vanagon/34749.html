Howdy!

 Thanks to the two people that responded to my lengthy message. I appreciate
your help and comments.

 I do have a couple of questions, remembering that Wilma is a 1982 Westy.

 1. Are components (body, inside) interchangeable with other Vanagon
campers? If yes, which years?

 2. Is it worth it to buy the $70+ manual for the '80 to '82 Vanagons? I do
have a Bentley for Vanagon, although is very general.

 Although I'm not too mechanically inclined, I learn pretty fast. As far as
my experiences is concerned, I don't have too much to contribute to the list
except for the fact that I do have a pretty sizeable database of VW vehicles
that are or have been for sale in my area (Northern Kentucky) for the last 3
months. I can contribute this to the list if asked. As of this moment, the
database is in MS Works format and MS Access. It would be no problem to dump
an ASCII file of said database or convert it to other formats. Years
available of vehicles start at 1950 up to present. There are no EV's,
though. I understand by reading other messages that sale ads are not to be
put in this list, so, if anyone would like the information, just ask for it
and I'll be more than glad to e-mail it.

 BTW, there is a fellow selling a 1960 Transporter (he calls it cargo van).
I haven't seen it but just finished talking to his other half who told me
that it is in very good condition and running fine. He is selling it due to
the fact that he wanted a newer vehicle. So, to make a long story short, he
bought a 1969 VW van! Is the asking price of $1200 fair? She said that
mostly, all it needs is cosmetics like paint and nicks. TIA
