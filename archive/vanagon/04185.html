Subject: N.C. area buses - camping opportunity 
Date: Fri, 16 Sep 94 09:37:13 EDT

This isn't exactly Volkswagen, but if anyone wants to go bus camping with a
bunch of buses/hippies, the student radio station I work at, WKNC 88.1 FM, is
sponsoring another gathering at William B Umstead park here in Raleigh. I do
the Grateful Dead show, and organized this. We did one in the spring and it
went pretty well.
     Anyway, if anyone is interested, it's Saturday, October 1. Camping is
cheap, and it should be lots of fun. If anyone is interested, I can send you
details...
Thank you and have a nice day.
Richard
