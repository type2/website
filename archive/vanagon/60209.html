&gt; &gt; When filling the gas tank I've had splashback both times (can you

&gt; &gt; trick to this or is my gas tank ventilation system bad?

&gt; Karl,
&gt; 
Splash back is a problem on alot of vanagons.  Mine does it and the
ventilation system is not clogged.  Just slow down the pump when your
comming close to the top.
