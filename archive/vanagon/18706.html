Subject: RE:[F] Eurovans owners shown as litterbugs


I am offended by the protrayal of Eurovan owners in that commercial
that Jonathan brought up. 

My family DO NOT litter. However, every chance we get, I pull the van
over to the side of a road next to a bill board....send the kids out with
spray cans to paint funny faces and obscenities on bill boards all the
while I proudly uninate into on comming traffic!!  ;-)


Sheeesshhh...couldn't the makers of the commercial use Chrysler 
shitboxes??? We ALL know who rude owners of those vehicles can be!!  8-)
