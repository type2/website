Subject: Blown head gasket

I've a blown head gasket on one of the cylinders. Is it all right to
keep running the Westy '82 until I have enough resources to get it
fixed? Besides the loss of power (just running on 3 cylinders), are 
there other things I need to look out for by running this engine with
a blown head gasket?
