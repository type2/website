Subject: Re: New Head Gasket Stud Kit From Raceware

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm gonna forward this one to the list.

The price is steep,  however they do work.  I have used thes studs on
Deisels.  However,  the Wasserboxer problem is usually corrosion related or
the gasket shrinking.  These studs will not help either situation.  By the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yea, Tim Smith pointed these things out; he called these things snakeoil

way,  I do not pull heads to repair small external leaks.  I use a leak down
tester to confirm there are no internal leaks.  If okay I use aradiator
sealer.  I warm the engine slightly, drain some coolant, then add sealer. I
then run the engine to circulate the sealer through the block and heads and
shut the engine down before the thermostat opens.  I then let the vehicle sit
for a few hours. Then drive normally.  I have a near 100% success with this
method.  Remember I am talking small leaks,  no gushers.
