Subject:      Re: Phosphate-free anti freeze

Thanks to all of you ( 9 ! ) who took the time to set me straight about the
importance of phosphate-free anti freeze.  I obtained some Havoline brand
phosphate-free today from my FLAPS for only 3.99 after rebate.  I promise
to get both my 86 and my son's 84 flushed and refilled promptly.

Another example of the great people and advice available from this list!
