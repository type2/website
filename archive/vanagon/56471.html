Subject: Vanagon front suspension/track question?

Something quick I need to know, archives list a front track increase 
for '83, how was this accomplished, or more to my point is a air 
cooled '80-'83 steering knuckle compatible with an '85 Vanagon, both 
using the early ATE brakes.  The track change listed is quite trivial 
(.6&quot;) and if indeed true, I would have done it by changing what is
machined off the spindle, if this is correct will my hodge podge mixing
of parts cause any problems, I could go out and look at the '81 and 
compare, but it is cold, and dark, and the '85 is still taking up the 
garage.

For anyone wondering, the damn '86 spindle with Girling calipers in a 
NO GO, asshole at the yard claimed Van was an early '85 like mine, 
headlights are gone, looks early, I launch into self removal as I've 
been waiting on him for 2 months.  Get down to it and notice it is a 
a late Girling brake model, take off the caliper just to check and 
turns out that since the later mounts the bolts into the caliper, the 
earlier mounts the bolts though caliper into spindle, they seem to 
have simply drilled out the holes on the later spindle and it will 
not interchange.  About 30 minutes of my time wasted.
