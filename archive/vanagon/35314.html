Subject: Re: How tall is a Westy????

In a message dated 96-02-13 18:36:29 EST, you write:

&gt;Amtrak is telling me that the max height of the van can be no 
&gt;more than 85&quot;. Do you think it will fit? Anyone feel like measuring theirs?

I measured mine.  I have trouble with parking garages.  My 85 Westy is 6&quot;
10&quot;.  I don't take it anywhere that is less than 7'.  Most the parking
garages where I live (Washington DC) are 6'8&quot; so I just kind of gave up on
even trying to find a garage to park in.

My wife and I took the autotrain once.  We went from DC (Lorton) to Orlando.
 It was really funny.  Our small Hyundai Excel (ick!) sitting in the parking
lot at the train station ready to be loaded on the train amongst dozens of
full size caddilacs.  My wife and I are in our mid twenties and everyone else
on the train could have been our grandparents.  The train ride was fine,
except all the snoring.  (Oy Veh!)
