Subject:      quick help on rockers please!



Two questions on the rocker arm. On a 1600 which of the rubber seals do you
use from the gasket kit. The choices are a short one that looks the shape of
an inner tube, the other is taller and looks like a piece cut from the end of
a white piece of tubing. I have bolts that hold it on so Muir says the
doughnutshape one, which is it. I screwed up last time and wasn't smart enough
to learn from my mistake. I am thinking it is the one that looks like a piece
cut from the end of a hose.

2nd question: can hardened steel washers work as shims for the rocker. I am to
close to the valve to adjust, so will the washers like the ones on the head
bolt work?

Thanks,

Tim 69 westy
