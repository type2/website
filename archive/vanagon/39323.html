Subject: New EV/Winnies Seen In Transit

I was driving through Pleasantville, Iowa (pop. 1531) today, on 
my way back home after getting a person out of jail (my job). I was 
surprised when a flat-bed semi truck pulled out two blocks ahead of me, 
loaded with three brand new Eurovan/Winnebago conversions. It was an 
extended flat bed with 2 Eurovan Campers and a Rialta on the back. 
Wow, $100,000 worth of VWs!
	I shouldn't be too surprised as all the Winnebago conversions 
are done in Forest City, Iowa. But that is northern Iowa, and I was on a 
lessly traveled backroad in southern Iowa. Of course they were all-white 
and they looked impressive. I don't know where they were headed on that 
road- the license of the truck was Indiana. Maybe a future car of one of 
the list members?
