Subject: Installing the 1.9L TD (Not TDI), the odyssey begins...

Volks,
I took my `82 Westy Diesel (&quot;Tortuga&quot;) in last night for what I hope	will
be the transformation of it's and my lifetime. The new 1.9TD is supposed to
arrive today for the swap ( I hope). Thanks to all who contributed on the
list, especially, John at VW Bus, for the handy gearing program he sent.

As it stands, without putting in a new (or used) 5 speed, I have a choice
of redoing my existing 4 speed with a 5.50 ring and pinion for a top end of
about 69mph _at_ 4000rpm or a 4.57 r&amp;p for 82mph _at_ 4000rpm. I wish there was
something about in the middle but I've been assured that there isn't for my
tranny. The list of trannies that Helmut sent shows one with a 4.86, which
would be ideal. Anyone know of a source for that R&amp;P gear?

At any rate, the old (but still good. Anyone need)1.6L is coming out today.
The die is cast and I'm holding my breath.
