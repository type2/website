&gt;How about the nose you were looking for? Rusted out or smashed? Or never
&gt;had one? Just trying to imagine how newyorker beast should look like.

Some dummy went left of center and hit my bus.  Their car was totaled, but
it only made the bus a little cross-eyed!  The Bus can really pack a punch.
This most recent damage is additional to the leaky windshield, the broken
driver's side window regulator, and the rusted rocker panels (floor solid).
Very restorable, but it looks like a &quot;Salzigwagen.&quot;
