Subject:  Language Designation Filters

 Ric was kind enough to establish a language protocol on 9/10. One small
point: here in the northeast, the designation for French (Fr) may lead to
considerable confusion due to our proximity to Quebec. Clearly the language
as spoken in Quebec differers from that spoken in the old world.
Could we, therefore establish two classifications:  FrC (Canadien) and FrP
(français moderne...)?
 Many Thanks, Moe
