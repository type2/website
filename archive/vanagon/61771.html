Subject: 91 Syncro

As I understand it, 91 is the last year the Syncro Westfalia was made,
right?

I'm looking at a 91 Syncro, and had a few questions:

1. How reliable a vehicle is this?  I understand that the 4WD system was
never really perfected; is this accurate?  

2. How well will the camping gear work in the winter?  I understand that
water freezes, so don't anticipate using the sink in the winter, but
does the stove/furnace work?  Does the 91 Westy have a furnace?  Will it
keep me warm?

3. Is this a full-time 4WD?  Does it have a transfer case that allows
you to shift between 4 low and 4 high as well as 2 high?

4. I understand that the 91 Syncro Westys came loaded, is that
accurate?  Power windows, locks, mirrors, etc. as well as air.

5. How well does the regular heater (from the engine) work?  Does VW
still struggle with adequate heating? 

6. Is the impression that they're touchy vehicles, hard to maintain and
expensive to repair, accurate?

Thanks for the feedback!  I look forward to reading your responses.
