Subject: save this bus!

A friend of mine has decided to get rid of his '71 bus. He's had it
for years. I don't want to see it end up at the ecology dump, so if
anybody out there wants it, he's going to practically give it away.
The engine is in pieces, since he was going to rebuild it.  The
registration needs $40 and a smog certificate to bring it current.
I'm sure that he'd sell it for $100.

I'd buy it, but I already have two.
