Hey Listies!

        Thanks for all the advice regarding piston slap, etc.  On Saturday,
I put down a deposit on the 93 EV MV Weekender that I found in one of the
want ad type rags.  It seems to be in pretty good condition, except for a
cracked rear bumper assembly that they are going to replace this week.
Unfortunately, there is no owners manual, and being a novice in the field of
E-Vanonics, I have many questions.  They did scare up a manual that was
printed in 2/92, but the descriptions of the controls and such aren't even
close.  Plus, there is no information about the MV configuration or the
Westfalia equipment.  Is there anyone who can help me with the loan of a
manual for me to copy, or a copy for which I would be eternally grateful?
Also, is there a separate manual for the poptop and minifridge?  The dealer,
a veritable weasel den by the way, is supposed to come up with not only the
manual, but also a copy of the original service history from the great VWoA
mainframe.  I'm not holding my breath, but I do have one pair of fingers
crossed, just in case.  Anyway, more later!

                        Thanx again!

                        Ned
