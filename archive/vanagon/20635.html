&gt; Cn anyone here advise me as to how I can safely remove the metallic trim
&gt; that runs just below window level on my '72 Camper? I'm in the midst of 
&gt; a paint job, and I wanna clean look on that trim. Any advioe is appreciated!

You could replace the seal with one that doesn't have the groove for the
trim.  Looking at the RMMW catalog, it looks like a new windshield seal
for your year is about $110 with the groove, and $20 without.  I'm
buying the one without.  :)
