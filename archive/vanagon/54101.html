I agree on all but the heater outlet - gets in the way and easily tripped over.
Can't put anything there neatly as in others!

&gt; The owner said he had driven both the 5 and the 6 and didn't notice *that*
&gt; much difference, at least on the low-end. (He barely had this one broken in
&gt; so hadn't really revved it up yet.)

I test drove both a 'used' '95 5 cyl (5000mi) and a new '97 6 cyl. I had the 
chance to 'open them up' on the Istate. Clearly a difference - but I HATE
automatic trans! anyway. Around town they were about equal.

I prefer to be in sync with my Westies - that is, know what gear I am in and
be sure I am in the right gear! I don't like the way the EV automatic 'shifts'
and I could not get either of them into the alternate lower gears - neither
could the salesperson figure it out!

I also did not like the handling after 9 years of Westies - steering is just 
too 'tight' to me. I felt like I might flip it on a tight or fast curve. I was
told that the '95 nor the '97 came in standard/5 speed - but lately saw one
advertised in CA and one in Canada that had 5 speed. Perhaps I would like these
better. After climbing to the Eisenhower Tunnel in Colorado this summer with
my '91 Westy fully loaded - in the truck lane with the 18 wheelers - I really
appreciate standard because at least I believed that I was not straining the
engine!
