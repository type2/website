Subject: Tops that pop straight up
Date: Mon, 13 Feb 95 9:13:03 PST

 Regarding the thread on non-Westy pop tops that go straight up [rather than
 hinged]: I've seen a couple of breadloaf buses with tops installed by a
 company called ASI. These tops had a mechanism that included some really
 long springs and an x-bar linkage so that the weight of the top was easily 
 raised straight up. 

 Both of the buses with these tops that I have seen were 7 passenger models 
 that had the pop-top added later. 

 As to the question about the location of Sportsmobile - I've think I remember
 seeing them advertise in &quot;Motorland&quot; , the magazine sent to AAA auto club 
 members. I'll look through an issue tonight if it isn't already thrown out.

 Best Regards,

 Dave &quot;digesting and ready to s...&quot; Kautz
