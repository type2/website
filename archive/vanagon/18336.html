Just put in an oil temp gauge. At first I thought it wasn't working but
eventually it climbed to 150 after 15 minutes. 180 seems to be the normal
temp for oil, but judging from this gauge 240 is in the middle so maybe
this is normal? As for head temp a maximum of 500F is all you really need
(with 250-300 in th middle). Oil pressure need not exceed 100psi with 45
psi smack in the middle.


As for placement, i have two to my right just below the &quot;silver socket&quot;
and the the left of the radio mounted along the lower edge of the trim. The
oil temp is on the same horizontal but to the left of the steering wheel.
Checking the gauges requires a glance down now and then but this location
has two advantages: a)easy installation and b) a more clean dash look.
