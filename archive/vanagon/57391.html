Hi Durby,

I just went through this with the PB campaign on my '86. Call VWoA and they
*should* have all the records pertaining to your VIN number. It doesn't
matter if you are the original, second, third or whatever owner. My local
dealer did hassle me quite a bit, but surprisingly, VWoA was pretty helpful
once they realized I was determined and had done all the research (thanks
Joel et al).

Good Luck!

tony

&gt; 
&gt; I was checking out the 'Vanagon Recall Information' FAQ &amp; I've
&gt; determined that my '87 Vanagon GL Wolfs. falls within some of the
&gt; affected VINs on four of recall campaigns (SU, PW, PB &amp; PG).  I'm the
&gt; 3rd owner &amp; unfortunately, the 2nd owner's documents left to me did not
&gt; mention whether or not my Vanagon had ever been to the dealer for any
&gt; 'corrective actions'. 
&gt; 
&gt; My question(s):
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Since I'm the third owner, is the recall still in affect where I can
&gt; take it to my local VW dealership for the necessary 'corrective
&gt; actions'?
&gt; 
&gt; 2)  How can I determine whether my Vanagon has already been through the
&gt; 'corrective actions' for each particular recall campaign?
&gt; 
&gt; 3)  If determined that I can still take my Vanagon to the VW dealership
&gt; for the repairs &amp; that my Vanagon has not already been repaired, is it
&gt; as simple as calling them to make an appointment for the repairs?  Will
&gt; the VW Dealership hassle me about repair costs?  
&gt; 
&gt; Any information would be greatly appreciated.
