&gt; What I need from all of you dedicated Vanagon &amp; Bus owners is all of the pros
&gt; &amp; cons of the original tents of the 60's &amp; 70's and a wish-list of features
&gt; you would like to have in your tent.  Also, tell me at what price range you
&gt; would suggest these tents to sell.
&gt; 

Pros:  They last forever.  This is because of the heavy-duty construction.  I would 
think that most VW owners would prefer a heavier and more durable tent (like canvas 
with big strong poles) to a lighter weight (like nylon) that will last for 5 years 
or so.  I know I plan on owning my bus until I die and I figure that my Westy 
drive-away tent might last that long also.

Price:  Apparently a bidding war took place on the aircooled newsgroup for a 
drive-away and bids were going above US$500.  I think the price you get may be 
directly proportional to how closely you replicate the originals (to some degree 
at least).
