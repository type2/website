&gt; Hi volks,
&gt; 
&gt; here's a mini trip report of yesterday's activity:  Thursday someone
&gt; posted on the local &quot;umich.forsale&quot; newsgroup of some VW parts, free, about
&gt; a 40-min drive from Ann Arbor.  Of course the prospect of buckets of
&gt; rusty, oily, junk parts of no use got us all excited here so a caravan of
&gt; three (my '62 bus with Malika the intrepid dog, Greg with his '71
&gt; Squareback and Emily the intrepid daughter, and Dan (since his bug and
&gt; notchback are &quot;in resto&quot;) in somethingorotherwitharadiator set out on the
&gt; quest.
&gt; 
&gt; First Greg and I had stopped off to check out a convertible super that a local
&gt; woman had just got (drove down to Texas to get it and drove it back!), that
&gt; was fun.
&gt; 
&gt; Then it was off to free-part-land (read:  son off to school and  dad says
&gt; time to clean out the shed).  The deal was we had to take everything and
&gt; that it
&gt; was admittedly mostly junk.  This proved to be the case, as heavy wire baskets
&gt; of rusty old pistons and rods were loaded into my bus, as well as an engine
&gt; which had seized sometime in the 70's and had sat outside since then (it had
&gt; a &quot;B&quot; on it but no serial number, a replacement case?).
&gt; 
&gt; I wish I could report that bins of barndoor bus parts were found, but no, mostly
&gt; engine stuff that should have been thrown away a long time ago.  I did get some
&gt; stuff I could use, like underneath engine tin in better shape than what
&gt; is on my bus now, and Greg liked the Type III fuel-injection fuel pumps.  The
&gt; convertible that we had stopped off to see needed heat-riser seals and a
&gt; shifter, which it will now have, and Dan's bug gets an intake manifold.
&gt; 
&gt; Other potentially useful stuff was some beetle turn signals, knobs, and a
&gt; steering box, and a whole box of new engine bearing sets, plus some things
&gt; like another 34PICT 3 carb that I can take parts off of.
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing I'd never seen before was some aftermarket distributor, made
&gt; by Scat, big enough for the condensor to fit inside.  Also, has anyone ever
&gt; seen a Bosch &quot;019&quot; distributor or know what it's for?
&gt; 
&gt; OK I've rambled on enough, just wanted to share a fun little road trip.

	The stock dist. in my '64 deluxe sedan has the condensor inside 
the cap, but it also has a very small diameter vaccuum advance module on 
the outside...

	anybody know if the Pertronix points replacement ignition will 
work in a 6V system...???

		Thinking 'bout doing this in my '64 bug...I really hate 
points...
