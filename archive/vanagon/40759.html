Subject: need help with a stalling problem.  60 single cab w/1600

i have been having this problem for some time now without being able to
solve it.  maybe someone has some suggestions for me.  the single has a
1600 single port motor with a mild Engle 100 cam.  it is running a stock
intake with a 34PICT carb.  stock vacumn advance distributor.

the motor likes to stall alot.  this especially happens when i take it out
of gear to come to a stop.  at high RPM's it is fime, but at low RPM's it
will stall.  Right now i have to have toe iddle real high in order to try
and overcome this.  it works sometimes.  i have gone through the carb a
few times.  i don't think there is a leak at the head, but not possitive.
it seams like when this all started was the first time i rebuilt the carb,
some time ago.  it has not run the same since.  i don't know what i did
though.  any ideas out there?

Take care and God Bless
matt
