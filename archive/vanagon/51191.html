Hey all,
Well, today I got around to rewiring the sink pump so that it is always
available, i.e. not dependent on the LED panel.  The LED panel has been
very unreliable on mine and was causing weird things to happen.  So, I
took it out of the circuit for now and if I ever get a new one or fix
the old one then I can easily put it back in the circuit.  Basically,
the water pump power line comes from a yellow wire which is powered by
the LED panel (it's one of the 6 in that big connector aft of the LED
panel).  There's also a red wire in that connector that is hot all the
time, so I just rigged a jumper wire from the red wire to the yellow
wire, so now I get water pump when I turn on the faucet handle.  Of
course, this keeps me from using the LED panel as it's no longer
possible to plug in to the connector (my jumper wire as the reason) but
hey, it was being too weird anyway.  I also reconnected the connector
that I pulled apart earlier to get the sink to work (I think the reason
this worked was LED panel weirdness).  I think I determined (by reading
the wiring diagram) that the three wires in that connector (black, blue,
brown) go to the refrigerator heating resistor relay.  So now
everything's going like it's supposed to.

BTW, I see in the manual a reference to a 10 amp fuse above the flame
indicator inside the refrigerator door.  My fridge apparently doesn't
have this fuse, tho if you look closely you can see a little cutout
where it's supposed to go.  Can you only get to it from behind the
fridge or something?  Just curious.

Thanks to everyone for the help and patience, this should be my last
post about the sink :)

Sean
