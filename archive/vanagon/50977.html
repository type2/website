&gt;Subject: Lonely VW Bus
&gt;
&gt;     
&gt;     Thom,
&gt;     
&gt;     Enjoyed your Web Page but VW buses are not my hobby.  I have owned two 
&gt;     and I loved the iceboxes.  Often thought the only sane place for them 
&gt;     was Calif.  That is what caused my problem that I am hoping you might 
&gt;     have a suggestion.
&gt;     
&gt;     A year ago my second daughter finished her college and headed for the 
&gt;     West Coast.  She didn't have much money and I knew that the '75 VW bus 
&gt;     was longing for a milder climate so we shipped it to her at a cost 
&gt;     almost twice it's street value.  She kind of half lived out of it 
&gt;     while trying organic farming in Santa Clara and working in a 
&gt;     vegitarian restaurant but then went to Idaho and became a river 
&gt;     rafting guide and then followed her boyfriend to Chile for more river 
&gt;     work leaving the Bus in Monterey with an elderly grandmother and in 
&gt;     need of either a valve job or new engine.  It has the original engine 
&gt;     rebuilt about 40,000 miles ago.
&gt;     Now the daughter has ended up in Maine with the boyfriend and working 
&gt;     on a sailing schooner and planning to sail around the world after 
&gt;     rebuilding an old boat.  They bought a pick up truck and our old Bus 
&gt;     now sits forlornly in front of her grandmother's house.
&gt;     I can get out there in Dec and dispose of it but it will be done in a 
&gt;     hurry and would much prefer to find an owner that will be a little 
&gt;     more faithful than my daughter.
&gt;     I haven't seen it for over a year now but when I last saw it there was 
&gt;     no body rust and the inside was in pretty good shape.  Should be about 
&gt;     80-85000 miles on it.  I would like to get about $250 out of it and my 
&gt;     daughter wants the radio--its set up with 4 speakers and does have ear 
&gt;     deafening volume.  However all is negotiable.
&gt;     Any suggestions on how to connect up with an interested party via the 
&gt;     internet?
&gt;     Sorry for the long saga but thought the background would help 
&gt;     understand the Bus's personal situation.
&gt;     
&gt;     
&gt;       
&gt;
