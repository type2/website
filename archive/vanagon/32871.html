Subject: Not overheating Kombi &amp; holidays

Joel,

I'm back.

My plans for taking Kombi on a holiday to the coast didn't happen because 
it was still overheating. Ross fitted a secondary oil cooler on 29 Dec (I 
was due to leave on 2 Jan) but Kombi was still overheating. So I took my 
wife's Ford Laser hatchback (like a Mazda 323). Left Kombi with Ross - 
&quot;I'll pick it up when it's fixed!&quot;

Turned out that the problem was not overheating but the Gene Berg 
dipstick temperature guage (actually properly fitted to the case, not in 
the dipstick hole) was very pessimistic. A proper VDO guage now fitted 
shows that Kombi was not overheating at all. Very frustrating for everyone 
involved.

Good thing that came out of it was that my son and I changed our plans of 
where we were going to go and explored some beautiful mountain and 
hinterland country which we had never seen before on our trip to my 
brother's place near Kempsey, NSW. We wouldn't have done this in Kombi 
because our plans were to travel the main highway.

I do plan on returning to the back roads with my wife, in Kombi.

Happy New Year
