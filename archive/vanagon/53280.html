Hey all,
I have a quick question about lighting.  I've got an '81 Vanagon but I'm
posting to both lists because there are probably some Type2er's who can
help me out.

What I want is brighter lights for the brake light (which is a separate
bulb from the tail light in a Vanagon) and the back-up lights.  VW calls
for 21 watt bulbs for each of these applications.  I noticed in RMMW's
Cabriolet catalog that they sell an adaptor that will allow you to use a
20-watt quartz halogen high intensity bulb in place of the stock 21-watt
incandescent bulb.  They advertise it for use in brake lights and back-up
lights.  I was wondering how hot these halogen bulbs get.  Would they melt
the lens or what?  Also, RMMW wants $24.95 for a set of two adaptors (I
think the bulbs are included).  That seems kind of pricey.  Has anyone seen
this type of adaptor before in a FLAPS?  I haven't.  

I currently have 35-watt incandescent bulbs in place of the stock 21-watt
bulbs for brake lights and back-up lights.  They are brighter than the
21-watt bulbs but not as bright as I was expecting.  How much brighter
would a 20-watt quartz halogen bulb be than the stock 21-watt bulb. 
Basically the idea here is to be able to see behind the van when backing up
(Joel would say &quot;Put a fog light on the back and wire it up&quot; -- I don't
know if I want to do that) and to have brake lights that say &quot;I'm stopping
NOW, dammit!&quot;  Should I go for these halogen dealies?  Anyone have them on
their van?

Thanks in advance,
Sean
