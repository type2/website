&lt;&lt; 	Next Question: How about easy-fit mudflaps? The VW dealer ones are
 expensive. Heard of any other ones? Maybe something from a different
  car that work? I'd like not to have to drill a lot of holes. &gt;&gt;

Wolfsburg west , Rocky Mountain Ripoff Works and others carry the repro VW
logo mudflaps for the bus.  You can put there on a Vanagon too.  Troy
Heintzenrater (sp?) of G.A.S.S has a set on his V-gon westy. 

cheap, about 25-35 bucks a pair.
