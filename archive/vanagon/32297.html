Subject: what do 1975 westies sell for?

my uncle wants to sell his 75 westy.  it is in great shape cosmetically.  
the interior and  pop-top are in great shape with no rips.  the engin and 
trany are also good.  it is fuel injected with a automatic trany.  the 
title is a salvage because teh PO totaled it out after a engine fire.  it 
realy did not need that, but insurance.  the only known problems are that 
it nees a new electric choke unit and a few interior electricle bugs 
attended to (fridge)

i am a splity owner and enthusiest so i do not know the value of these.  
he is trying to get a idea to deturmine if he will sell it.  any info is 
welcomed.

thanks and God Bless
matt
