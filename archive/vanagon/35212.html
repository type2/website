Subject: Wanted:  Subaru 2.2 sources

I am back on the Subaru warpath.  My leaky water pump it turns out is 
only half the culprit, as a head is leaky too.  Sooo.....  I am 
thinking about the 130hp conversion (Woo hoo!).

If anyone knows where I can find a decent source of 2.2 Subaru 
engines I would be greatful.

Thanks.

P.S. - I can make it down the coast to pick up an engine if someone 
there is able to do the install while I'm there.  Any list members up 
for a project?  Steve M?  Hmmm...?  Just *pretend* it's a V6 :)
