This whole thread reminds me of a Science Fiction story I read a while 
back.  Called &quot;Why Johnny Can't Speed&quot;, I do not remember the author but 
I'd like to find it again.  The premise was that the freeways around Los 
Angeles (most major cities I assume) had become a battle field.  All 
vehicles were equipped with armour and heavy weaponry including drop 
mines and recoilless rifles of all types as well as full auto 50 cal. and 
larger automatic weapons.  Volkswagens being the lightest armoured and armed 
the drivers of these were sworn to protect each other.  Johnny takes off 
in his beetle with twin 50's and a small rocket launcher (drop mines too 
I think) to go to a friends house in Orange County and get's aced by 
a black Caddy with a 105mm Howitzer.  Daddy has to break out the Assault 
Lincoln and go avenge Johnny's death.  A cute story and somewhat 
prophetic given the freeway shootings we had here a while back.  I can 
just see a pack of beetles assaulting a convoy of Oldsmobiles in Azusa.
