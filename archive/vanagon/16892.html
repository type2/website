         AT&amp;T 800  's web site
For those of you with a web browser, AT&amp;T has a neat web site that
will do searches for toll free numbers
http://att_dot_net/dir800
for example, a search for 'volkswagen' brings up many VW dealerships
and parts places.  a search for 'automobile AND parts' brings up
several hundred #'s for everything from bumpers to salvage to parts
warehouses.

OXYGEN SENSORS

1-wire Oxygen sensor replacement:
&lt;from jwalker_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu (Joel Walker)&gt;
try your local auto parts dealer for a 'universal 1-wire'. it costs
about $40, but does not have any connectors on the wire. you'll have
to splice it to your original connector.

3-Wire Oxygen sensor replacements:

&lt;from macklow_at_sybase_dot_com (Jim Macklow)&gt;
Ford Parts Dept. oxygen sensor replacement
On the receipt:  0258-003-913  3-wire Oxy sensor $65.19
On the box were the numbers: 610328 021 13913.  13913 were also in big
numbers on the end of the box.  This oxy sensor is for Ford/Mercury
cars, and does not have the correct plug, so you have to use the
connector from your old sensor.

EXHAUST PARTS

Autocavan sell stainless exhausts for all VWs. A silencer and tailpipe for a
2-litre motor cost about 150 pounds. I don't know about the other bits. They
have agents all over the place but the address of the main office is:

FLOOR MATS
&lt;From: &quot;Norman Leong&quot; (norman_leong_at_engtwomac.synoptics_dot_com)&gt;
  Someone last week asked about floormats, so here's my contribution
  to the search:
      Lloyd Design Group      (818) 768-6001
      8435 Telfair Ave.
      Sun Valley, CA  91352

  For the Vanagons they make a 1,2, or 3 piece floormat set
  (I hear the 1 piece is the one to get) for the front.  Depending
  on whether you have the forward facing bench or the rear facing
  captains, there is a rear passenger floormat set that will fit.
  Lastly, they also make a mat to cover the rear cargo area.

  Now for the bad news:  They (Lloyd) only sell to VW dealers,
  repair shops, and independent parts/service dealers, so you may
  have to search around for these mats (or samples to look at).

REKEYING VW DOOR LOCKS
&lt;William Warburton, w.warburton_at_edinburgh.ac_dot_uk&gt;    2 May 1994

Each lock has a cylinder with eight sprung brass inserts. If the
correct key is inserted they are moved into the cylinder so that the
edges are flush and the cylinder can then be rotated, unlocking the
door. To set up the lock you will need a collection of these inserts
so that you can match them up against the key you want to use.  Get a
few locks from a scrapyard by removing the whole handle/catch &amp; take
them apart at home to get the inserts and to get a handle on how they
come to bits.

 The front door handles can be removed by undoing a pair of allen bolts
which are accessible after removing the interior door trim. The lock
cylinder has a tab at the end which performs the locking and can be
removed by undoing a philips screw. To remove the cylinder undo the very
small grub screw (which protrudes (inside) into a track in the cylinder,
limiting the movement of the cylinder).  this screw is at the inboard end
of the cylinder (and may have fallen out!). When you put the tab back
on the cylinder remember which way round it goes (mine point forward).

 The back hatch catch is held by a single phillips screw at the bottom
(again, under the trim). It has a similar grub screw to locate the lock
cylinder.

 The sliding door mechanism varies with year, on mine ('71) the lock
cylinder is in the handle and the whole thing comes apart be removing
the philips screw in the middle of the inside handle (with grub screw
retaining the cylinder) later models have a seperate lock below the
handle which works in the same manner as the other locks. I can't
remember how you get it out but I think it is quite clear once the
trim is off.

 Once you have dismantled a lock &amp; have the cylinder in front of you
you can slide a key in &amp; see the way that the brass inserts move (four
from each side). To match a key you find an insert which has the slot
in the correct place for the key you want to use and place it in the
appropriate slot. If it is too deep (or shallow) then compare it to
your spare inserts until you find one that looks right &amp; try it instead.
If you are short a couple of pieces then you can miss out an insert
(which means that the location is wildcarded, any key will fit it so it
is less secure). In the extreme you could have a cylinder with no
inserts &amp; open it with a coin. You may need to replace some of the
springs (or stretch them slightly) to get the inserts to move properly.

 The cylinders are *NOT* all the same! If you need to replace any of
the cylinders you'll need to be a bit picky about where the replacement
comes from (ie you can't replace a door lock cylinder with a tailgate
cylinder).

 I didn't touch my ignition lock, I used it as the master &amp; matched all
the other locks to it. If you have an odd ignition key but everything
else matches, what a Bummer! I don't know anything about changing the
ignition switch :-(

OIL NOTES

Summary and Data Synthetic Oils
===============================

Note from editor of this article:
---------------------------------
I collected several articles on synthetic oil which seem to contain
more fact than opinions.
I went through the trouble to verify some of these facts, and also
added the data for the new Castrol Syntec.

The conclusion is that synthetic engine oils are indeed better than
regular oils, though you may not use your car in such a way to get
full benefit of the oil.
Even a good quality mineral oil changed at regular intervals (around
3000 miles or 5000 km seems to be the norm) for average use will allow
most car engines to last well beyond other components' useful lives.

The first article is an excellent detailed technical description on oils,
followed by a couple additional notes derived from another posting.
