Subject: cam question

Since I found a bent pushrod in my engine, I'm naturally going to replace
them all.  And since I fully expect all the lifters to fall out all over
the place when I split the case, I'm also going to replace all the lifters
(they're cheap anyway).  Now, assuming the cam is ok (it has very low
miles on it), is it alright to use the cam with the new lifters and 
pushrods?
