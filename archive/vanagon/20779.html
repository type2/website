Subject: Re: buying a new or used VW in Europe

Bjorn Rettig &lt;bjoernr_at_microsoft_dot_com&gt;:
&gt; I am planning to buy a Vanagon or Eurovan with Westfalia equipment
&gt; in the next couple of month (probably in August).
&gt; 
&gt; I used to drive a '87 Turbo Diesel Westfalia in Germany. (I am living 
&gt; in the Seattle are now.) How stupid of me to sell it ;-) 

I will move to Europe in a year or so, and I wonder what mid '80:ies
westy or vanagon costs there, or more precisely in Scandinavia or
Germany. How much are new Eurovans? Eurovan Westys?
(By the way, what is the Eurovan called in Europe? Seems unlikely
that it is Eurovan.)

I have an 82 Westy here, and I'm also considering bringing it back to
it's home. Does anybody know how much it costs to ship a car? And how 
difficult will it be to import it into say Germany or Sweden?

/Martin

PS I'm also curious about the Turbo Diesel. Please tell me some more.
Are they very common in Germany? Did they sell the non-Turbo diesel
also?
