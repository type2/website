&gt; parted company. This was the first time I worked with him. Now I'm in 
&gt; dire need of a recommendation from you wonderful folks out there for a 
&gt; good, reliable mechanic in the Seattle, WA area. 
&gt; 	Please help before this road hazard I'm stuck with gets me a 
&gt; ticket, causes an accident or worse!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

	While I'm in PDX now, I did considerable biz with Quentin's in Lynnwood.
	They seemed to be very knowledgeable but, of course, upscale $$-wise.
	I think there's another shop in Kirkwood or somewhere near I-405.

	But, the best in NW WA. is a shop up in Burlington near Sedro Wooley
	called ???????? .....Damn! 'can't remember the name....something about
	German Autowerks or Kraut-werken or something like that. Ah!
	Bavarian Motor Works, I think. Try phone info..
