Subject: Re: STICKERS AND T-SHIRTS/Just make them !!!

Ok, Ok, enough  everyone make stickers, everyone make T-shirts,everyone be
happy. Buy from whoever you want, for whatever reason you want.  It's none
of my business how type2 list runs, nor V_at_L.  Just keep them running. 

&gt;list admin. that I know who has been direct about asking for money, or 
&gt;selling items to pay for list expenses. Perhaps I'm just spoiled in that 
&gt;I've never had to pay (directly or indirectly) for the services of a list.

Well I have... the Porschephiles list (its members) was soliciting donations
to buy the listmeister a new PC, think they did get  one to keep the list
on.  There were 1100+ listers when I quit that one, overwhelming.  We are
lucky on V_at_L due to peoples kindness and a bit of adminstration 'blind eye'
at UMN.

on with the show.
