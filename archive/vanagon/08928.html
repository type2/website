&gt; 
&gt; When I was younger, I was on a tour bus going somewhere for school, and
&gt; there was this guy in early evening traffic, abusing himself whilst he
&gt; was tootling along the freeway.  Gue he figured no one else would see, or
&gt; maybe he wanted someone else to see?  Remember, this _IS_ California...
&gt; 
But, the question remains: &quot;Are you still master of your domain?&quot;
