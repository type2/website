Subject: Hello!

Hello!

I'm new to the list, and decided to pop my head out and say &quot;Hi!&quot;.  From 
what I've seen so far, this list looks like the place I need to be.

I own a '67 Kombi that I'm planning to resurrect, and I'm glad to see 
that there is a mailing list (support group? :) for us breadloaf people.
