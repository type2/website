Subject: alternator light

After letting my bus sit for a month or so, I finally got under it and worked
on the starter/solenoid problem.  Cleaned all the contacts, inspected the wiring
and am planning to implement the starter relay solution, if I need to.  Now,
[I'm not sure if this just started happening or not] I noticed the other NIGHT
in the dark that the alternator light stays on *very* dim and fluctuates
somewhate in brightness.  If I turn the headlights on, it gets brighter.
If I increase RPMs it gets a little brighter.  Always very dim, though.  I had
not noticed it recently I guess because it is imperceptible during the day, its
too dim.

I looked at the fan belt, it appears to be OK.  I looked at some of the other
wiring and re-inspected what I had done at the solenoid.

Does anyone what is causing this?  How do I go about chasing this down?

Thanks
