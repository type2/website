&gt; seeing bill abbott's post about anti-seize brings up a
&gt; question for me.  somehow i've ended up with two cans of
&gt; anti-sleeze in the shop, one is silvery, the other coppery
&gt; in color.  as i cannot find any info on the feelthy cans
&gt; would someone kindly tell me the different uses of these two
&gt; compounds?  when would i use one rather than the other?

I think one is aluminum based and the other is copper based.  The copper
based one is for higher temperature applications like spark plugs and
exhaust nuts (which you can also buy in copper, btw.).  The aluminum one
should be fine for cooler locations like most of the screws holding the
tin on, etc.
