Subject:      EV: How do I love thee?


Just to chime in with my EV kin: 34K mi on ours. No piston slap. Aircon
blew last summer (fixed on basic and extended warranty) (ballast resister?
on high speed fan first went, then fan, then A/C blew out the cannister by
the right front wheel). Otherwise: no problemo. We love ours. Find it plenty
peppy. Expecially uphill in 4th at 60. WOuldn't give it up for twice the
price. WOuld definitely buy again but have no plans to. We're still paying
for this one.
