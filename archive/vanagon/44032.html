Subject: Wierd electrical problem

Hi Volks,
  Lately I've noticed something weird about the dash panel of my vanagon.
Occationally the Seat Belt light will come on (buzzes if I don't have my
belt on) and at the same time the red light flashes on the temp gauge.  In
an effort to find the trouble I noticed that it will happen when I step on
the brake pedal, actually when I relax my foot off the brake pedal.  I hear
static from the radio and then the lights flash. Could the switch be bad?
The brake lights do work.  Maybe the ground is bad?  If anyone has any
ideas I would like to hear them.  Thanks.
