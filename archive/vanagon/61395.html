Subject: 4wd Sofcom site (no vanagon content)


While looking over the 4wd site, and Derek Drew's Pictures there,

I noticed that the entry for the Kubelwagen

http://www.sofcom_dot_com.au/4WD/4WD.html

 says it's 2wd only with no mention of the Kommanderswagen or the
Schwimmwagen, both of which are 4wd vehicles.
Oh well...  At least the picture is nice even if the text is mis-leading.

Derek...   What's chained to the front of your synchro in the snowy picture?
