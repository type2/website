Subject: Re: Vanagon Floor Mats

&gt;&gt;I have a set!... My only beef is this; the mats are not left/right they 
&gt;&gt;are booth exactly alike. Not a big deal as the only real difference is a 
&gt;&gt;cut out for the gas pedal. This causes them to slide somewhat and the 
&gt;&gt;carpet is exposed at the cut out.

&gt;I called Parts Place. Are yours rubber? I had heard they were plastic... 
&gt;The salesman said $38.95 for the pair... 


I checked on these this morning while ordering some Bentley manuals.  The 
distributor I deal with carries the Vanagon mats. They sent me a picture, 
and they appear to be the same ones pictured in the Parts Place catalog 
(i.e. same shape, same lettering style on the word &quot;Vanagon&quot;, etc.) They 
are listed as &quot;heavyweight textured durable rubberized vinyl.&quot; 

Incidentally, both this picture and the Parts Place picture show mirror 
image pairs, not two identical mats.  I wonder if the picture is wrong, or 
if Parts Place just sent Chris two right mats by mistake?   

Anyway, I could offer them at $32/pair.
