Subject: Re: Duplicate postings - me or you?

Well, I've been having this probem also.

Well, no.  The nature of the beast (the Internet) is that every post has 
a unique number.  And on top of that the listserv checks to see if you 
accidentily posted a duplicate.

&gt; I see those too, from the vanagon list. But my own posts to the list,

I have, just yesterday one of my posts was duplicated.

&gt; You know, I kind of promised myself that I wouldn't perpetuate this thread,
&gt; but I thought of another possible explanation.  Are all of the duplicate posts
&gt; from the vanagon list?  'Cause I'm also on the aircldvw list, and while I
&gt; also get duplicates, I've never noticed if maybe one was on the vanagon list
&gt; and the &quot;duplicate&quot; was on the aircldvw list because the author cross-
&gt; posted it.  Just (yet another) a thought.

I've discounted every possibility I can think of:
1.  I'm only on the recipients list of the Vanagon list once.
2.  I use procmail, so all mail sent to Vanagon gets put in a seperate 
folder.  Likewise, other mail lists go to seperate folders.
3.  Personal replies that are CC'd to the list are marked as personal.

So I see no reason why it would be a problem on my end.
