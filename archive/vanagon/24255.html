Subject: Re: front end

     &gt;recently i came across a '72 bus with an emaculate interrior and 
     &gt;exterrior REALLY cheep, the engine is also ok. The only problem is 
     &gt;that the two tubes and brackets that hold the entire front end 
     &gt;together are severely rusted and beginning to bend.  Does anyone know 
     &gt;what it would involve to do the repair myself, of a good detroit 
     &gt;local repair facility, or where to get the parts cheep?
     
     I would be concerned as to why the front beam is so rusty and the rest 
     of the but isn't.
     
     However the beam can be easily removed since it is bolted to the 
     chassis. Just get a new beam. You can buy them brand-new from The 
     Bus-Stop, and rebuilt from BusBoys. You only need the center section, 
     you can use all the suspension bits off your beam. It take about a day 
     to remove the beam, strip the parts, rebuid the new beam and reinstall 
     it. All you need is a few big sockets 17mm, 19mm etc. some good axle 
     stands and jacks etc, and a few strong mates because the complete beam 
     is really quite heavy. You could choose to remove the suspension from 
     the beam whilst it is still on the bus. This makes things alot 
     lighter.
