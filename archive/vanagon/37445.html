Subject:       Old splitty camper

This is for all you split window folks--I'm looking at an old 
splittie, and I'd kind of like to know what year it is before I go 
back to the owner with a serious offer.  It has bullet turn signals 
in the front, and red glass circles in the rear,  but it's not a 
barndoor.  The front seat is a bench, and th rear is a camper 
interior, but not in the traditional sense.  It has a metal frame bed 
with longitudinally oriented springs that runs down the driver's 
side.  The engine deck is filled by a removable wooden Westfalia 
cabinet.  The buss has three windows on each side of the passenger 
compartment, and the very small window on the rear hatch.  It also has 
a rectangular metal hatch on the roof about 18&quot; by 36&quot;.  The whole 
bus is in great shape, with some relatively minor problems.  Very 
little rust--my ex girlfriend remembers playing house in it back in 
the early 70's.  She said it had been parked where it is now for years 
when they started playing in it as kids.  I think it's been parked 
since the late 60's.  Glass is all good, but the mechanicals are 
probably shot.  A good candidate for ressurection, I think.  I thried 
to get the VIN out of the engine compartment, but it was locked with 
a padlock and a hasp.  I didn't know about the other number locations 
when I was up looking at it last.  

Any guesses as to the age or comments on the find???
(It's too far away to just zip out and look for the numbers)



Thanks!
