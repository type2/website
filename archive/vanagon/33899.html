Well, that's not *entirely* true 8^).  I remember an article in one of the
automotive magazines (don't remember which one, it was so long ago) that
discussed drag and drag coefficients for various vehicles.  Interestingly,
a splitty bus has a lower drag coefficient than a 65 Mustang, though it has
more actual drag due to its larger frontal area.  So, the bus IS a better
aerodynamic design than a mustang, but since it is an aerodynamic box, it's
mearly a better application of aerodynamics to its particular configuration
than a Mustang is to its.

&gt; I used to try and drive as fast as I could(within reason) when I first
&gt; owned my bus. I was used to driving a car, and didn't worry too much
&gt; about it.  Well, after the first gas bill came in, I quickly learned why
&gt; I had always been passing all those buses before:)  I think I was getting
&gt; something like 13 miles per gallon(at 70) which is what my old 68 Pontiac
&gt; got with 3 times the engine.

Related to this issue, I have a question that others may (probably) have
experienced.  When driving both my 67 Bus and 60 Singlcab (with 67 running
gear) above about 62mph, certainly above 65mph, I sarted getting oil past
the oil slinger into the engine compartment.  I drove up to 70 mph from
time to time several years ago, till I discovered that driving around 60mph
completely eliminated the problem.  I have often wondered whether this may
have been due to running high-volume aftermarket oil pumps in my engines
(the ones with thicker than stock castings and wider gears) simply
overwhelming the return drain in the case.  I sold the bus never having the
chance to reinstall a stock pump and thus &quot;knowing&quot; the answer (didn't have
to rebuild it again), and the Singlecab has been apart the past 3 years or
so.

I had tried various combinations of aftermarket oil filters and coolers,
versus simply installing a doghouse cooler, and agree with a comment from
Gene Berg's catalog from a few years back, that none of the aftermarket
coolers improve on the stock coolers.  To top it off, I was always having
oil leaks from either the cooler tubes wearing against the mounting bracket
or the hoses hardening or cracking at the ends.  Doghouse coolers
definitely cured those problems, and my engines lasted longer, too.  I just
got back into changing the oil every 1500miles.  No big deal.

60 Singlecab (it's begging me to put it back together! Now that I'm reading
so many interesting old bus stories from this great list, I go out and pat
it once in a while to let it know that I still &quot;care&quot;).
