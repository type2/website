I know I'm treading on thin ice here...

There has been much discussion of shop manuals here,
and on the Porsche list (of which I'm also a member, although
I'm now Porsche-less as of last monday)

Anyway, the new company I work for, AllData, sells manuals
on CDROM that have the TSB, recall, info, wiring diagrams,
diagnostic and repair procedures, test procedures, maintenance
schedules, and bunches of other stuff.

Its $24.95 for a single make/model.  I haven't actually used it
yet, but I've seen it used a coupla times, and it looked 
neat.

They have a web page at: http://www.alldata.tsb_dot_com

Yes, I am connected to them, I'm the Systems Administrator.

I won't bother you guys with this again.

(Gawd, as I re-read this, it sounds kinda cheezy....)
