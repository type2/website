&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, back to the topic, I've had the Koolatron box for two weeks now, 
&gt; &gt; and I guess I cannot complain....  It does keep pretty cool even inside
&gt; &gt; the van out in the parking lot for over 8hrs., and does not seem to drain
&gt; &gt; the battery to any noticeable degree.  I got the 30-liter version, which
&gt; &gt; is quite spacious, but, to my dismay, DOES NOT FIT between the two
&gt; &gt; front seats of my '87 Weekender :-( ...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is a nice thing to have for $99.00 plus shipping, but one thing
&gt; &gt; that really upset me is that they sent me the A/C adaptor and charged
&gt; &gt; me $49.00 extra for it, even though I specifically asked for it NOT sent
&gt; &gt; to me.  Even though a $10.00 radio shack adaptor will NOT work here, I can
&gt; &gt; get a transformer powerful enough for much less than that.  And 4 $1.00
&gt; &gt; Radio Shack power diodes should do the rest....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I guess I'll have to get on their case and send their adaptor back...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have not had an occasion to try it in heating mode, but, I imagine
&gt; &gt; it'll do even better....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Whoa!  How can I get more info on this contraption?  You say you
&gt; use it when the car is turned off and it keeps you cool?  With
&gt; out much battery drain.  Is it a water cooler or AC?  Help me
&gt; out here.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

I think this contraption is the same thing I saw in my local marine shop.
It is an electric cooler/heater. Looks like a coleman. It isn't any heavier
than a coleman either. Will keep things cold or hot! Plugs in to a 
cigarette lighter. Uses very little power (they say).

Pretty nice. This one even came with a slidein tray that allows you to
turn it on its side to make it work like a fridge. I think it cost a
$100. I contemplated ripping out the fridge in my camper and installing
one of these in its place. Might be more practical.
