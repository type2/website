O.K., O.K., cannot hold back anymore :-)

Sears 10HP lawn tractor, with the deck and everything.  With the jumpseats
out, put the two ramps, and pushed the tractor up (in transverse position)
into the middle cargo area.  It turns out there is about 1.5 inches or so
left in the width of the '87 Vanagon when the whole length of the SEARS
Tractor is sitting in it.  The width of the tractor is about 2 inches less
than the length of the cargo area ;-)
