Subject: Westy Resto From Hell update

Happy Anniversary! I rolled the POS bus into the &quot;bodyshop from hell&quot; one
year ago today! Surprise, surprise, the guy is literally going out of
business October 15th, 1995. My wife was laughing that we drive him out of
business. I countered and said that we just provided him with a retirement
fund! Bumpers, pop-top, and wheels are painted and securely in the garage.
I'm still at the shop every single morning. Even with this effort we will
not be able to have it ready for the Fall Phoenix Bug-o-Rama beginning of
November.
