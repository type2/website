Subject: Re: Brake Drum Removing


----- Begin Included Message -----


&gt; My 84 vanagon GL has gone through at least 3 times of pulling brake drums.
&gt; I had the same question you have. I wasted some time getting nowhere in
&gt; determining how to turn the adjusters. I then went ahead to pull the drums
&gt; without loosening any star wheels. I figured that if the wheels were able
&gt; to run it should be ok to pull them off.
&gt; 
&gt; I used a gear puller and they both came off without hassles. I did have to
&gt; loosen all star wheels later to push the drums back in though. You will find
&gt; out how to adjust them back while the drums are off.
&gt; 

My problem is that I have no puller. Do you remember if one has to go straight
in or from the side to hit the star wheel?

Thanks, Richard

Richard:

I determined that loosening satr wheels was not necessary to pull the drum off.
A gear puller can have 2 up to 6 legs. A puller with 5 legs would be great but
mine has only 3. Screw wheel lug nuts back into the drum but not all the way
to the bottom. Position the puller with the center long screw against the
axle while have the hooks of all legs pulling the lug nuts. Now slowly turn
the center screw of the puller. You will see the legs in action of pulling the
drum off.

If pulling from lug nuts doesn't work then you might need to fit some pieces of 
wood or metal to the drum then try to pull the wood or metal. Hopefully this 
gives you the idea how it works. The Bently Manual has a picture of a puller
in pulling position. The manual is widely available from public libraries.

Good luck again.

David
