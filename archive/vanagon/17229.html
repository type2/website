Subject: Newbie cares for opinions

Hi all. Let me break the ice by saying that VW is part of my being, too, as I
owned a '73 super beetle for four years (my first vehicle), which I had the
pleasure of tinkering with (understatement of the century as you're all aware
of) and which allowed me to dirty yet another copy of The Complete Idiot. :-) 
I have since purchased another vehicle, but have decided to return to VW; this
time tho, I'm in the market for a bus/similar. I just read through a
substantial amount of the FAQ and archive sight literature (you can't see this,
but my eyes are practically bleeding) and am completely overwhelmed by the
scope of the subject.

What I'd like to know is if there is a comprehensive buyer's manual for
reasearching, leading to the purchasing, of most/all types of the 'mighty
road-bound bricks'!?! Any personal angles/ opinions/stories/insights/leads
would also be *greatly* appreciated!!

Ideally, I'd like to get my hands on a basic, clean, and reliable model (of an
undetermined year... that's why I just subscribed to your group) with no
concerns for speed, torque, synchro (due to $), or highly priced options...
call me the turtle, I guess, from the race with the hare. *But*, a camper rig
is right up my alley, tho. I think you understand. Anyway, I know of the basic
historical changes in design ('49, '67, etc...) and believe that the third
(late '70s) will start to be out of my price range. I'm willing to spend
between $2000-$2500, maybe more if a peach materializes.

I hope I'm not treading on thin ice in anyone's eyes, but if I am, my asbestos
suit's secure, so flame-away if you must! ;-)

Thank you all very, very much!!! This is already a labor of love.

Sincerely,
Scott

ps- Not that it should matter, but I'm an employee here.

Thanks again.
