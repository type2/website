Subject: Cleaning Tin-ware



To All:

Cleaning steel parts is a snap compared to aluminum or magnesium alloys.
 Just boil it.  With lye.  Not only will it remove all of the grease, it also
takes off the paint and much of the rust.

A 55 gal oil drum cut in half and fitted with a lid makes a good parts
boiler, a kind of poor-man's hot tank.   Or cold tank, although things happen
more quicky when the stuff is hot.   Provided with a pump, blower and a bit
of plumbing, you can do a fine job of heating it using old lubricating oil.
(If you're interesting in foundry work, the same burner assembly provides
enough heat to melt a good-sized crucible of aluminum in about twenty
minutes.)

The importance of the tin-ware is often overlooked.  If you're doing an
overhaul you may find my privious post 'Easy Tin' of value.
