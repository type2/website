Subject: wartime vw in movie

Foreign film night:  it was only a brief glimpse, and it could have been
something else.   i was watching 'Europa, Europa', a great film in its own
right, even though they missed out on a good potental for showing off old
vws.   there could have been loads of Kommanderwagens, Schwimmerwagens.  what
i saw  it could have been a kubelwagen.   find out for yourself.   

i also got 'Bye Bye Brasil', in hope of seeing lots of vws (filmed in 80 in
brasil, eh?), but the d*mn tape skips and cuts out the picture sometimes,
though the sound was uninterrupted.    But seeing as we don't understand
portuguese, this made it less than entertaining.
