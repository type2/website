Subject: EV tire recommendations...and EV Synchros


I realize that there has been much written in this here neighborhood
about Vanagon tires...well, its time to explore a new frontier (or
frontire as the case may be)....EuroVan replacement tires. The 
EV now has 32k miles, and the Contis are worn, cracked, etc...

I would like to replace them with an all season M&amp;S type tire...
what suggestions...they are 205/65 R 15s....


BTW one of my graduate students from Germany popped into the office
today with some T4 info...including a new T4 catalogue with the
model line-up featuring the SYNCHRO!!! I'm IN LOVE!!!! Especially
with that nice red Synchro!!

Now all we gotta do is get one over here to this side of the
pond...and get Martha to pose in flannel in the fold-down
rear seat, and find some blond-big-breasted-bikini-BUS-bimbo
to pose in front, and guaranteed, we'll get into VW T&amp;A...oops
Trends yet!!!
