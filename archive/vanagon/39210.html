Subject: OK--Who planted it??

This is really strange but true.  

1.Bought a tent for my 76 Westy that was advertised in the Limbo Classifieds
that someone posted to the List.  Tent is perfect except for the back rear
corner top tube whick some had broken at some time and then welded.  Works
great....looks kinda crappy.  

2. Have been searching for a GOOD rear screen without holes and nice shape.
In fact one is on the way to me UPS that a list member sold me.

Well.....today went to Pick your Part in Sunland and there was a 72 West
that was already pretty stripped.  Looked inside for the heck of it and
lying on the floor....

REAR CORNER TENT TUBE &amp; REAR SCREEN

No other tent parts in the vehicle---just that one.

I tell you I started to look for the video camera or one of my friends that
might have staged it.  
Went up front to pay and as usual with parts that are not obviously a tire
or a bumper they charge next to nothing.

Admission = $1.00
Tent tube = $1.00
Rear Screen=$1.00

I don't think I need to total it for you.  All and all a very good day!!
