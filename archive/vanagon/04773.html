Subject: Re: question of oil level

Martha querries (and I'm reading on a Friday morning (watchout!)):
&gt;Anyone want to theorize all the bad things that could happen if
&gt;you add TOO MUCH oil to your vanagon/bus?

Martha if you was my wommin and it was MY vanagon/bus, you would
be spanked and sent to your bedroom without dinner, and no television.
You would then be forced to read three year's worth of &quot;sano restoration&quot;
reports and VW-bikini-bimbo bio's..

Next time you'd learn NOT to keep pouring oil into the engine until
the ENTIRE dipstick is covered!!!
