&gt; Quickly changing subjects:
&gt; 
&gt; The other day, I was driving in my community and I passed a few
&gt; teenagers walking along the road. As I passed, one of girls yelled
&gt; &quot;I like your car!&quot;. 
&gt; 

My sisters tell me the same thing.  Believe me, they don't mean it as
a compliment.
