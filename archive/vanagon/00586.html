Sorry to have Barked, Pete and others; 

&gt; Wow .... I'm slowly going from an innocent, well-meaninged contribution to
&gt; well over my head. As I cited, I'm not electrically inclined so I had
&gt; professional help on this and placed a LOT of trust in an RV dealer and a
&gt; manufacturer.

I wasn't aiming for the jugglar, more for the brain. I have done alot of 
electrical experimentation, and let me tell you, jumping from a burning
car on the interstate, brandishing fire extinguisher in one hand and fresh 
trousers in the other, is not a pretty site. Even less so if there are
children and/or SO's in the car; Fortuneately for me I have neither :)
If I ever go out, the only thing that will miss me is my bus, and that
means it will probably have gone out too :)
Enough smiling, this is serious (but hopefully in a lighthearted way).
Advice can be dangerous, I do believe in good intentions but please remember
&quot;FREE ADVICE IS WORTH EVERY PENNY&quot;. I am the last person to discourage
distribution of knowledge (I'd be lost w/o this) but realize that others
may take you for your word. 

&gt; The inverter was mounted between the Eurovan front seats and two 4 gauge
&gt; cables (two positive and two ground) were used between the Aux battery and
&gt; the inverter; distance would be less than three feet.

This is exactly what my post recommended (2 4ga cables running in parallel
for EACH terminal). Another poster suggested using single 8 or 6ga cable;
we're talking liquid copper here. Your dealer was wise.
 
&gt; The microwave, during the test, was placed in the area of the sliding door;
&gt; distance would have been about three to four feet.

This again sounds about right.
An alternatorish style 1200W 120V ac  source is 
available from some aftermarket outfitter (for sailboats I believe).
All you need is a free motor pulley to drive it. On the downside, since
your motor was designed to produce torque (and not rpm's efficiently), this
is kind of a waste/overkill way to get the power. Convenient and safe tho,
not to mention cheap.
