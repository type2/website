So Stuart The-brake-fluid-gourmet Hutton says:
&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; After tasting the worst taste in my life (brake fluid) and under Joel's
&gt; and William's prompting, I did call the Rocky Mtn. Poison Control center.
&gt; It turns out that brake fluid is only poisionous in the following
&gt; circumstances: You get a mouth-full and breath in quickly.  This takes
&gt; the brake fluid into your lungs and causes a sort-of chemical pneumonia.
&gt; This is most frequently seen in small children.  However, if the brake
&gt; fluid is swallowed (or motor oil for that matter) it will pass through
&gt; your digestive system.  Of course, it will taste bad for a while.
&gt; Thanks, Joel and William for your concern!
&gt; Still, it is the worst taste that I've ever tasted!
&gt; Also, I assume that all this applies to fairly small quantities.

This kind of reminded me of the gasoline du jour I recieved the first time
I changed the fuel pump/lines in my wifes '70 squareback.  Whew!  Was that
nasty.  Worst burps I ever produced.  Great excuse for getting a beer though.
I finally learned to drain the tank BEFORE proceeding.  Made things alot 
easier and less dangerous.  If there had been a spark I would have been
VW/Steve flambe  :O
