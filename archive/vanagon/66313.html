Subject:      Tires 205/70R14

Just to add to the discussion about tires, I went to the local tire store:
Wheel works and asked what they had in a reinforced 205/70R14.

Their reply was that the only tire they knew about was a Michelin MXT (at $93
each)
I did ask about the Yokohamas but they came up blank. They did offer to
double check if I came up with the Yokohama model that I was interested in.

The one hesitation I have about the Michelins is that my current ones (MXL)
seem to have ultra flexible sidewalls which gives the van a driving feel not
unlike being on a boat in rough swells. Is this a characteristic of the
Michelins? The Vanagon?

Opinions?
