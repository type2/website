Subject: Rubber seal


Hi volks,
  I'm new to the list. Don't know what's kept me so long. Hopefully I'll 
be able to help someone out (own an '89 Westy with it's share of foibles) 
but for now I'm looking for advice. The seal around the cap (poptop 
section) never seemed to be properly attached from day1. I drove the van 
for the first couple of winters and freeze/thaw made a bad situation 
worse. Wound up peeling the whole thing off. The metal strip inside was 
badly corroded. I removed it and cleaned up the inside of the rubber 
strip assuming I would be able to glue it to the cap directly using 
&quot;goop&quot; or someother sort of product. 
    Has anybody tried this or is it necessary to purchase a seal with the 
metal clips inside?
   Phil
   '89 Westy
