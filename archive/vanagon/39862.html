Subject: Engine Rebuild pt III(?)

Well, decided to go ahead and replace the P's and C's, found a set of
Cofap(?) from a place here in the Bay Area for 280$, sounds good to me. I
never removed the hydraulic lifters, do I still need to remove them and
bleed em? Or should they be ok? I decided to leave the case alone. It was
making no strange sounds when it was running, and I've been told the TypeIV
internals are pretty solid,and I'd like to get this going soon.

Setting deck height. Can someone please explain a good method, and what
kind of sealer to use. etc....Hopefully will get this back together for the
weekend! Thanks again for any and all help!  Tom
