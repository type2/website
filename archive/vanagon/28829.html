Subject: Re[2]: Coolant Temp Indications

     This is in response to gregor's note:
     
     I had a similar problem with gauges on a Fiat quite awhile back; when the 
     headlights were on and sitting at a stop, for example, the lights would dim 
     a bit and the fuel and temp gauges would peg, then accelerating away they 
     would drop back to normal and the lights would brighten.  This went on for 
     months and I couldn't track down the problem; checked grounds, dash pwb, 
     everything I could think of.  Then one day the car failed to start and I 
     had it towed to my mechanic and he found that a wire inside of the 
     distributer, a connection to the Hall sensor, had shorted and fried. He 
     replaced the internals and cured the problem of the dimming lights and 
     wandering gauges.

    hi Jim and Drew !
 i don't doubt what you said Drew, but i've had the same gauge problem in my
rabbit and i'm sure mine is completely electrical (i.e., NO overheating) 
because at the same time the temp gauge shows hot the fuel gauge goes up as 
well. never thought it serious enough to fix it, figured it's mebbe a loose 
ground connection in the instrument panel ???
    cool on,
                gregor

Jim, &gt;  &gt; &gt; My coolant temperature indicators are intermittently screwed up. 
&gt;
&gt;  &lt;snipped some more symptoms described&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; Your symptoms sound like what I was experiencing when there was a 
&gt; small leak in the coolant system.
&gt;
&gt; When there is a small leak, air can get into the coolant system. 
&gt; The air in the system can cause the temp gauge to read high.
&gt;
&gt; My leak was where one of the rubber coolant hoses is held on by 
&gt; the orginal &quot;spring pressure&quot; hose clamps. I replaced the clamp
&gt; with the &quot;screw&quot; type hose clamp, bled the system, and the problem 
&gt; never appeared again.
