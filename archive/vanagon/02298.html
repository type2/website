CB radios built in the last few years, which all use a synthesized design,
are better built than just about anything from the days when they used
crystals. Receiver technology has improved a lot and cost has come down a
lot so the $50 CB of today is actually a pretty good rig! Crystal versus
synthesized has no affect at all on sensitivity or selectivity (channel
separation).  I'm assuming that you're implying that better selectivity
(channel separation) will imply less trouble from splatter from adjacent
channels. This can be true, but it won't help you if the &quot;splatter&quot; is from
some loud-mouthed moron using an illegal &quot;linear&quot; (amplifier), all of which
are complete junk. I'm also assuming that you're implying that better
sensitivity will improve range which is true. A better antenna is the real
answer here as in ham radio or any other kind of radio. The Wilson 1000 and
the K40 are two CB antennas that are frequently mentioned as being very good.

Hope this helps...
