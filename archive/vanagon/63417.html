Mark-

My immediate reaction to your nitrous on a Vanagon topic: &quot;SUNDAY SUNDAY
SUNDAY!  Vanagon dragster action!  Come race or come watch..!&quot;  Ok,
sorry, I'm back now.

I agree with your concerns on the Sub conv.  Usually small car 4 bangers
are real torqueless, and most power is only at the top end pushing light
weight.  I am thinking of this conv, but am willing to wait for any/all
data to come in from fellow listers.  There are other things to
consider, possibly modify, on either stock or Sub eng, like a different
cam for example, whether the Sub is turbo or not, etc.  But I was
willing to poo-poo these concerns since the stock eng. is also little,
and is (somewhat) derived from engines that also pushed cars (and now
push campers).  For example, the GM 350 that was in '93-96 Camaros is
almost exactly the same as the one in their pickups--except for cam,
timing, injection, and other details.  So yes, the Sub engine will be
working harder, but so is the stock motor.  And now we're back to your
original question, will the Sub eng last as long?  I'm running in
cirlces!  I don't have any answers!  Only MORE questions!

Nitrous seems like more trouble than it's worth (but think of the
parties!)  I mean, you could get short term boosts (which is what these
systems are for) but other than that, you'd be spending $$$ to refill
your tank, and they ain't cheap.  After reading a lot in &quot;Compact Sports
Car&quot; and &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, many nitro users easily blow up their engines
because they don't know how to properly gauge how much goes in.  Too
much oxygen, and KABOOM.  Fine for a dragster, but not for 40 mile
grades into the high Sierras.

So perhaps a Chevy 454 mounted in the middle?  Cummins diesel mounted on
luggage rack?  Solar?  Nylon tow ropes behind semis?

Nothing to disclaim at this time.
