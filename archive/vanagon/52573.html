Subject: '86 Synchro FS Milwaukee

Hi, all.

Today in the Milwaukee Journal/Sentinal:

VOLKSWAGEN  1986 Synchro: 7 passenger, very good condition $3750 obo.  (414)
682-3428 Manitowoc.



I have seen this van. It's Wolfsburg Grey with the blue cloth interior. It's
real clean, and I didn't notice any rust anywhere. The owner says he has
recently replaced the power steering rack, clutch, brakes, and the van has about
137K on it. I don't know if the engine has been rebuilt (I assume it has) but I
will be in contact with the owner later tonight and I'll find out. E-mail me any
questions. I am willing to go look at it for anyone. I do know that he has
dropped the price from $4500 earlier this fall, but I don't think he has been
very actively trying to sell it (until now).

Usual disclaimers. I don't know the owner, other than seeing the van for sale.
