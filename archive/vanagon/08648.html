&gt; I haven't done the switch idea as has Sami (great idea) but I did move the

&gt; change was quite remarkable. original run temps were 220 F with idle at
&gt; 200; at the plug head temp is 340-350F. This change is only 4 inches across
&gt; from the side of the head to the top. DC--

&gt; Where is the FI head sender located? What about doing a survey of the 
  four cylinders to see just how different the temperatures are? Can those
  temp gauge senders be moved easily? Having no operating instruments other
  than the speedometer I am not familiar with the installation.
