Ed....While I can't tell you where to find what you are looking for, I have
found quite alot of small matchbox type cars at antique shops and the like
(you probably already know that though).  I did recently score a '66 Camper
bus that is made by &quot;The LINDBERG Line&quot; It is made of plastic and about the
same scale as a Matchbox.  Something that Bugs me too is one of the Hot
Wheels that I have in my collection... It is a split window Beetle that they
decided to do up as the abominable Baja Bug.  But they did do a nice oval
window Beetle with a nice trick Purple paint job.  Man do I wish I still had
all of my matchbox cars from when I was a kid.  My mother used to bring me
home one everyday from her job in chicago in the late 60's and early 70's,
Wow would those be worth $$$ today.  remeber when they used to come in
little paper &quot;Matchbox&quot; containers instead of the blister packages of late.
AAAHHH   the good ole days.  Peace. and Happy air-cooled motoring to you.
