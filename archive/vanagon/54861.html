Uniroyals are made by Michelin, as are B F Goodrich.

&gt;I hope you guys don't mind my joining this discussion.  I agree with 
&gt;mdstockr, that it is desirable to use the most tire 
&gt;available.  In some of the previous postings, the axle load vs tire 
&gt;rating was an issue, various numbers were generated.  What I didn't see 
&gt;being taken into consideration is that when your heavy van hits a bump or 
&gt;when taking a corner at speed, the load on the tires (and their 
&gt;sidewalls) can be greatly increased.  My other observation would be that 
&gt;Vanagons are rather tall, stilty vehicles.  I must admit, I havn't had a blow-out yet, 
&gt;but I always imagined that it would be sketchy, especially at freeway 
&gt;speeds (to further concurr that more is better for prevention purposes).  
&gt;Currently, I am running Uniroyal Laredos (C-rated, reinforced 
&gt;sidewalls) all-season tires.  I have had 1 pair for 30k and they still 
&gt;have half of their tread left.  They have excellent traction in dry and 
&gt;rainy conditions.  I went to Tahoe once with them and had good control in 
&gt;light snow conditions (I don't think they have an aggresive enough tread 
&gt;for serious winter conditions).  The best part is that they were only 
&gt;$43. ea. at Costco.  If anyone has any feedback on this tire I would be 
&gt;interested.  Without having used any other tire on my van, I would give 
&gt;them the thumbs-up.  Frankly though, I have been told by many folks that 
&gt;Michelins are the way to go.  Maybe next time, if I can fork-out close to 
&gt;$400.  for new donuts.  My understanding is that we are limited in our 
&gt;choices if we want the reinforced tires in Vanagon sizes.  Ok, I'm done.

&gt;&gt; I am a big fan of putting the most tire possible on a vehicle.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Plus, Volkswagon/Audi typically undertires their vehicles.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Therefore, I recommend using reinforced tires on Vanagons.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As for EV's, I have no idea what they take.  But, if VW specifies reinforced tires, I 
would 
&gt;&gt; comply.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As for Conti tires, I can not recommend them.  I am not satisfied at all with their 
quality.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; My wife purchased an Audi Quattro several years ago.  This car had Conti's and whenever 
&gt;&gt; there was snow on the road, the car would wander all over the road!  Very unstable.  Even 

&gt;&gt; though the tires only had 10k miles on them, I put a new set of Michelins on it.  The 
car's 
&gt;&gt; been wonderful in snow ever since.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I always recommend Michelin, Dunlop and Yokohama tires.  But, I don't know if Dunlop and 
&gt;&gt; Yokohama make reinforced tires for this market.

&gt;&gt; &gt; To MD Stocker:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;               Given your experience in the tire testing business, what
&gt;&gt; &gt;would you personally put non-reinforced tires on a Vanagon or EV? I ask
&gt;&gt; &gt;this because of Ric's new posting and because last year I looked into
&gt;&gt; &gt;buying a set of Nokian All -weather tires for the EV and decided against
&gt;&gt; &gt;it because they were NOT reinforced. The dealer's handbook actually listed
&gt;&gt; &gt;the EV 206/65/15 size but gave a non-reinforced tire for it that could
&gt;&gt; &gt;take about 1500 lbs for maximum load. But after discussions here and with
&gt;&gt; &gt;my local mechanic, I decided not to buy them and went back to the replacement
&gt;&gt; &gt;reinforced Conti's (an average all around tire with a great warranty). So
&gt;&gt; &gt;any advice you could offer would be interesting.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
