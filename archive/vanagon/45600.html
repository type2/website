Subject: 1990 Vanagon Intermittent Functioning Speedometer 

       I was camping in Northern WI this past week and my speedometer
stopped working.  It will not work at all for about the first 10 minutes
after the van is started, and then it works fine.  This all started
happening after the weather here got hot and humid this past Saturday.
Anybody got any ideas, is their a cable that I can grease or could it be a
bad gauge.
