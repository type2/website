Subject: Magnesium Rockers

Hi folks,

I picked up a Petersen's VW magazine dated 1973 at a flea market last
weekend.  It has many neat black and white pictures of vw parts in
junkyards, speed parts, and various buses and bugs.  In the speed section I
saw I photo of magnesium rockers.  They weigh 50% less than stock rockers
and I'd imagine last a lot less than stock too!  Seems like a strange
material to make rocker arms out of.  Are these still being used in race VWs
today or are they just white elephant items?

Outlined in the mag are procedures for rebuilding fuel pumps (I don't think
kits are sold for this anymore) and even back in 73 some lamentation
articles about the impending demise of the bug.  I also noticed pictures of
deck height measurement for an upright engine.  I noticed the cylinders
weren't torqued to the case, just a depth micrometer directly on the
cylinder--common practice back then?

Had fun flipping through it.  There's a neat picture of a spittie single cab
and another of a splittie panel full to the gills with
transmissions/engines/body parts.  Strange to get so much enjoyment out of
viewing black and white pictures of junkyard parts, oh well..
