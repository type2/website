There is no such FAQ although there should be. :-(

If someone wanted to go through the archives and compile a bunch of the 
topics and discussions that have gone on about this subject, that'd be a 
great service to our community.

aside: The Vanagon Web Page should be referred to as Skip Montanaro's
Vanagon Web Page. This isn't a denigration; it's just that there are
getting to be a lot of Web pages out there, and since I haven't put up one
on my web server, there really isn't one directly and officially
associated with this list. (I think his page is great, though!)
