Subject: 70 for sale

A friend of mine has a 1970 camper for sale.  No pop up but in very good 
shape.  89,000 miles , but complete engine overhaul about 10,000 back.  
All new paint and no rust, and all original.  (Coral White)  I have no 
idea what this brick is worth but he is asking 4,000 for it.  If 
interested you can call Tim at 704-644-5725.
As for myself I am curious if a vehicle like this is worth 4,000.  I 
haven't priced any lately because I don't need another and I'll never 
part with the 77 weWesty that I have.
