Subject: Re: finding bad syncro wheel bearing

&gt; And then the Fedrl Gummint will decree that all automobiles (not just
&gt; Syncros, or VWs) must have 4-wheel sensors that all indicate that
&gt; the wheels are firmly on the ground, before you're allowed to put it
&gt; into gear. The cost of this &quot;solution&quot;? why, just sign here, sir...  :^)

Everyone is welcome to political opinions but I'm not sure this is where 
to express them..
