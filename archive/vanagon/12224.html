So Joel Walker says:
&gt; i think it is a case of using the wrong material for the tank. my 88 bus
&gt; gets about 35,000-40,000 miles per tank. and i don't believe there is any

Then Steven Johnson says:
&gt;You really change it that often?  I haven't really noticed a problem at60K
&gt;miles.  Maybe I need to take a better look.  What are the tell-tale sigs?
&gt;I don't have any leakage that I can see.

hmmm. maybe they got it 'fixed' and i've been getting the last of the old
inventory. symptoms are coolant level starts getting lower, chaulky white-
blue (depending on your coolant) deposits somewhere round about the tank
or below it.
