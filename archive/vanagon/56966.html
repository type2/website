Subject: Power Steering Puddle


&gt;After following the process of purging old ATF fluid from the  system and
&gt;replacing with fresh per an archives plan, I now have a significant puddle
&gt;under the left boot of the steering rack--any suggestions as to what to look
&gt;at as I assess this new development?  I assume I sprung the leak while
&gt;&quot;turning the wheel from rack to rack while cranking the engine&quot;.  


When doing this initially ( just after refilling the power steering circuit
) the wheels *must* be off the ground!!!  And, it should be done slowly.  
Actually you should never crank the steering wheel to lock without the
vehicle moving unless absolutely necessary.
