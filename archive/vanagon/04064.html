&gt; &gt;I think this contraption is the same thing I saw in my local marine shop.
&gt; &gt;It is an electric cooler/heater. Looks like a coleman. It isn't any heavier
&gt; &gt;than a coleman either. Will keep things cold or hot! Plugs in to a 
&gt; &gt;cigarette lighter. Uses very little power (they say).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Pretty nice. This one even came with a slidein tray that allows you to
&gt; &gt;turn it on its side to make it work like a fridge. I think it cost a
&gt; &gt;$100. I contemplated ripping out the fridge in my camper and installing
&gt; &gt;one of these in its place. Might be more practical.
&gt; 
&gt; I had the same idea. (BTW, I cut out the ad from a magazine but then lost it.
&gt; Does anyone have a phone#?) Anyway, I'd like to replace my non-working
&gt; fridge with this contraption, but would like to keep the propane stove
&gt; above. So there might be 2 solutions: either hope that the koolatron is
&gt; small enough to fit in place of ye olde fridge, OR transplant the
&gt; cooling mechanism/plumbing of the koolatron only. 
&gt; 
&gt; Do those who now own one think that this is possible? Also, would you know
&gt; its outside dimensions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Sami

I know I could have deleted most of the above but I love sami's sig.

The Koolatron is not as effective as the fridge in your campers,  It was 
made for people who do not have campers and will only keep stuff cool 
(KOOL) not cold.  I wouldn't trust one with milk for more than 12 hours.  
Also, they do not have plumbing, They have no moving parts at all.  Yes I 
didn't beleive it at first either but appearantly it used Some sort of 
wonderful new semiconductor to transfer heat from the inside out or vice 
versa.
