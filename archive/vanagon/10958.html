Subject: Bolt-on Empi Valve cover question

     I all,
     
     I've heard some bad stories about bolt-on valve covers - like they can 
     leak as much as the standard clip-on ones. 
     
     You see I'd really like some Empi ones. I saw some genuine ones at the 
     Santa-Pod meet a few weeks ago and I nearly bought them. But I had 
     this thing in my mind that they might leak everywhere.
     
     So questions are:
     
     Anyone had them leaking ?
     
     Can you fit standard cover gaskets to them ? (ie. do you need special 
     gaskets ro will the stock ones fit)
     
     Lee.
