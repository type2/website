&gt; 
&gt; hasnt happened to me yet- i look at these a lot and wonder what the 
&gt; damage$ will be to do these.
&gt; 
&gt; Did you think of plumbing it in with 1&quot; PVC - $20 or less for both pipes
&gt;  more time on your part but i think it would end up a lot cheaper...

As I posted earlier, it took a week just to locate the part and at one
point I had discussed with the machanic the possibility of taking the old
pipe to a muffler shop and having them fabricate one to match.  I don't
believe he ever pursued that option since VW did come through with the 
part.

PVC is on the brittle side and that would concern me since the pipes
are exposed to potential collisions with road debris.
