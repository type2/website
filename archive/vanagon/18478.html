Exterior Windows Strips
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On My 85 Westy with 130k miles, I want to replace the chrome appearing (but
really plastic) strips that go in the black rubber window moldings. You know
them by the faded cheap and ugly plastic look they add to the windows except
for the passenger and drivers windows, as those have metal strips. Anyway...
I have the new strips in my hands and I removed one of them from the 
side door windows. However, putting the new strip in is very difficult! :-&lt;
The molding looks like this &lt;--) with the &quot;V&quot; going in the molding. I tried
soap, I tried prying and pushing and cursing and .... well, I tried not
putting it in at all!! 
In fact the newer Vanagons don't have a chrome strip and no groove to put one
in. I prefer the chrome strip...but not the faded burnt looking one! 
So...
Anyone have an idea how to get it in without all the hassle??
Or is it just simpler to yank all of them out, and go for the newer black 
look?? If I do yank them out, will they leak??

Thanks for you time and attention
Kerry
85 Westy, no rebuild, no leaks, no rust, and very crossed fingers!
