Subject: '82 diesel cooling problem

greetings,
Im hoping that someone has some helpful insight for me!
Let me preface my problem.  About a month ago, I had a hose split in my 
82 diesel westy.  of course it was exclusive to the diesel, so I had to 
shell out a cool $100 for a replacement. After installing the new hose, I 
topped off the coolant.  I probably should hqave drained and put new 
fluid in, but... About a week went by and the coolant sensor light came 
on.  I checked and added coolant. It ran fine until tonight.
On my way back from work, my coolant sensor light began flashing Again.   
The temp gauge which was in its normal operating level (low) began a 
steady ascent towards the &quot;red zone&quot;.  I considered driving the last 4 
miles home, but quickly thought better of it.
After pulling over, I quickly noticed the steam from evaporating coolant 
pouriong out the engine compartment.  It was obvious I had a leak 
somewhere, but as dusk was settling in I was having trouble finding a 
split hose or any source of the coolant.  I peered even closer, 
concentrating on the reservoir, which was making some strange noises.  
The blast from the exploding reservoir literally knocked me down! :0 As I 
sat on the ground wondering who shot at me, I quiclky realized the problem 
as coolant poured out from underneath the van .  
The Van is safe at home now, after a tow.  
Any ideas?  I havent checked into it as its dark now, but I plan to test 
the thermostat.  Does that sound like the problem?  Obviously, the 
pressure had built up.  Perhaps a clogged radiator?  I need Advice!
Does anyone know whether the reservoir is the same out of a gas vanagon?
Thanks in advance.
