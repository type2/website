&lt;&lt; What is the list's opinion on the subject of automatic transmissions vs
 standard on the '86 and newer vanagons? I am starting my search for a
 Vanagon camper and looked at an '86 GL camper last night that was
 mint.  It has an auto trans which I didn't really want. I think I would
 rather have a standard, but would like to hear about others' experiences
 and preferences... &gt;&gt;

Unless you plan on towing, I would not fear the auto.  Unless you destroy the
final drive, it is usually cheaper to repair an auto than 4 speed and the
performance with the 2.1 engine is acceptable.
