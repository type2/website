Subject: Insulating a bus ceiling



                               Foam on the Roof


The headliner is out, gone away somewhere.  Maybe you took it out or maybe
the PO got PO'd at it; it's not there any more.  If there was rust on the
ceiling of your vehicle, you've dealt with it.  What you want to do now is
insulate the ceiling with something that really works.

Urethane foam works.  It's expensive but it makes an incredibly good thermal
insulator and does a good job soaking up noise, too.

They make spray-on urethane foam but the most commonly available stuff is the
foam sealant you see in hardware stores.  It comes out of the nozzle as a
sticky string that swells as it hardens.  A bead of the stuff the size of a
pencil ends up nearly two inches in diameter.  The swelling is what makes it
such a good sealant.  The swelling is caused by gas expanding in the sticky
syrup of urethane, and it's those closed cells that make polyurethane foam
such a wonderful insulator.

Getting the stuff onto the ceiling causes a big question mark to form over
your head, just like in the funny papers.  The can must be held upside down
for the foam to come out, but held in that position it's impossible to apply
the foam to an overhead surface.  And even if you could, as soon as it starts
to expand, gravity pulls it away from the ceiling.  You end up with the
gawdawfulest mess since Herc was a stable boy.  The method I used isn't much
neater but it gets the job done.

I climbed into my '67 bug with a roll of Cut-Rite waxed paper and a couple of
cans of foam.  I was wearing plastic gloves and I'd spread some newspaper
around to catch any mistakes.  Shake up the foam and make sure it's warm.
 The stuff works best between sixty and a hundred degrees, and sticks better
to a warm surface than a cold one.  Make sure the ceiling is clean and dry.
 Give it one last precautionary wipe with a paper towel.

Tear the waxed paper into pieces about a foot long.  Make yourself a whole
stack of them, about ten pieces for each 12 ounce can of foam.  Odds are, you
paid between six and seven dollars for a can that size (1995 prices) so you
can see this isn't a lo-buck operation.

Take a piece of waxed paper in one hand with your hand under the paper like a
waiter holding a tray.  Squirt a bead of foam onto the paper starting in the
middle and spiraling out.  Keep the beads about an inch apart with the last
beat maybe an inch from the edge of the paper.   Move fast, you want a bead
about three-quarters of an inch thick. Put the foam can down.  Be sure the
nozzle rests on the next piece of waxed paper you plan to use.

Using both hands, lift the waxed paper up to the ceiling and stick the foam
against the metal.  Starting at the middle of the sheet of waxed paper, towel
the foam with your hands, filling in the gaps between the beads.  When you've
got the foam mashed down to about half an inch thick it's stickiness will be
enough to keep the thing from falling.

A plastic trowel will give you a more uniform surface.  You can make one by
cutting up the lid of a coffee can.  I used one about four inches wide.
 Since the foam is soft you don't need much strength to trowel it around.
 Work the foam out to the edges of the waxed paper then leave it to cure.
 Sealed between the metal roof and the waxed paper, the foam can take up to a
week to fully cure if the weather is cool.  Just let it hang there like a
pancake gone bad until the stuff is rigid all over when you poke it.  In most
cases, solar heat will build up inside the closed vehicle causing the foam to
cure in about a day.

Keep putting up your foam pancakes, spacing them about one-pancake apart.
 You'll run out of foam pretty quick and get a crick in your neck from trying
to trowel the stuff smooth.  Don't worry about the smooth part; urethane foam
sands easier than balsa wood.

Come back when the foam is cured and peel off the waxed paper.  You'll have
the damndest mess you've ever seen.  It looks like someone has stuck these
killer potato pancakes all over your ceiling, or over part of it, or just
'way back there in the corner if you didn't have the guts to go for the gold.

So get some more foam.  And some more waxed paper.   And start filling in the
gaps between the pancakes.

After you've blown about sixty bucks for foam you'll have a reasonably
uniform layer of rigid urethane foam over your entire ceiling.  If you're
going to re-install the headliner, you're all done with the insulation, no
further finishing required.  If not exposed to sunlight the foam needs no
other protection than its own dense surface.  

If you're not going to use a headliner the interior of your vehicle will look
a lot better if you sand the foam to a perfectly uniform surface and give it
a coat of paint.  The best sanding tool is a 1x4 about a foot long with all
the edges rounded off, no corners at all.  Glue some #80 open-coat sandpaper
to the round-cornered block and go to work.  But before going to work, dress
for it.  The dust from sanding urethane foam will go EVERYWHERE.  Wear long
sleeves with tight cuffs and collar.  Wear safety goggles.  Not glasses,
GOGGLES, that fit tight to your face.  Wear a filter mask.  Cover everything
in the vehicle you don't want coated with sanding dust.  Now you can go to
work.

The coarse sandpaper cuts through the foam like it isn't there, so be
careful.  Do a light once-over of the entire surface.  That will knock off
any high spots and give you some idea of the general contour you're working
with.  Since the roof curves you'll have to take it into account, doing most
of your sanding fore &amp; aft, working side-to-side only near the flatter center
of the ceiling.

Your goal is a uniform surface.  If you discover any low spots you'll want to
fill them with additional layers of foam.  Use the original procedure except
this time really trowel the foam flat.  If the swales aren't too big the foam
on either side will allow your trowel to find the proper level.  Come back to
your sanding after the low spots have cured and start over again.

Insulating your vehicle with cans of foam sealant is the sort of job that you
know will get done if you just keep at it.  There's no skill required, you're
making mud pies.  When the mud pies are hard, you rub them with a board.  All
the rest is mere detail.

What you'll get for your efforts will be a quieter, more comfortable vehicle,
one that's warmer in winter and cooler in summer.

                                       Sermonette

When the manufacture of glass fiber was perfected  it proved to be an
excellent insulator and quickly found its way into refrigerators and around
hot water heaters and a thousand other applications that needed to keep
something hot or cold.  Modern refrigerators and freezers use a thin layer,
typically half an inch, of high-density urethane foam.  NASA does too,
although a thicker layer of the stuff.  That's what insulates the space
shuttle's external fuel/oxidizer tank, that giant orangeish-brown torpedo
with the solid-rocket boosters on the sides.  Inside the tank(s) is hydrogen
and oxygen, both in their liquid state, more than twice as cold as the
coldest Antarctic night.  Urethane foam is a good insulator.
