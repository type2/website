&gt; &gt; I've heard the same thing...actually I've used a little (20:1, d:

&gt; For more years than I've been alive, there has been a product available in 
&gt; the U.S. by the name of &quot;Marvel Mystery Oil&quot;, which is supposed to be an 
&gt; additive for oil and gas, and is supposed to do all kinds of wonderful

ATF.

&gt; make your car explode, or it wouldn't still have a following.

Marvel Mystery Oil - It's a mystery why anyone buys it, the oil
which does everything, but nothing very well, and no one really
knows what's supposed to do, or what it was invented for, besides
our grandparents, who use it for lubing hte sewing machine...
IMHO...
