&gt;&lt;&lt; It was sold to me by a dealer as a 1987 VanagonGL Westfalia camper.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I assume it's a 1987 VanagonGL Westfalia camper. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ok. I have spoken w another listmember w/ an '89 full GL westy and his
&gt;doesn't have the filler tracks in the floor either. 
&gt;
&gt;But they did in '85 on the full GL westys. 
&gt;
&gt;so somewhere between '85 and '87 the florr tracks were dropped (why, I don't
&gt;know - It seemed like a neat Idea to be able to pop out those filler plates
&gt;and slide in a seat, buy VW works in mysterious ways... (kind of like taking
&gt;away the glovebox on the first Jetta III's....)
&gt;
&gt;so I apologise for insinuating that your '87 westyGL had the tracks, when it
&gt;obviously doesn't.
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if other listmembers could go and check under your cargo
&gt;floor mats and letsee if we can come up with the years the westy middle seat
&gt;floor tracks were available.
&gt;
&gt;So, westy GL owners, go look under your mats and report what you find to the
&gt;list.
