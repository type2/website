Subject:       Re: Sliding Door Silencer?

I clean the tracks with Varsol, and then use White Lithium Grease on 
all the tracks.  I do a grease change twice a year like this.  The 
door stays quiet and very smooth.  I don't have any problems with 
dirt, etc.

&gt; One more time folks - what kind of lube works best to quiet the sliding 
&gt; door? One thought of rubber wheels was interesting, but I don't think 
&gt; anyone has made that work - have they?
