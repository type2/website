Subject: A few interesting FS's up in Ontario

minimal rust) w/ solid body, newer engine certified last fall, comes with 1974

VR6...

conversion into Golf or Rabbit (ed. note - or Vanagon??) Asking $4800.00 CDN

Also as a final note a 1953 Barndoor Deluxe (pictures of it are on Thom 
Fitzpatrick's web page) that I had mentioned to some people was FS up here has 
apparently sold to an enthusiast in Florida for an undisclosed sum. Apparently 
the fellow wants to sell the 1953 Single Cab that was barn of the Barndoor 
Deluxe deal separately. New owner is asking $1,000 CDN (i think) for the p/u. 
E-mail me privately id you want to know more details about this.
