Subject: Any interest in a MA/RI/CT Drive-in Movie night


Back during the winter/spring, a couple of folks up here in the southern new 
england area mentioned the desire to possibly do a VW Van night at an area 
drive-in. Well, it's summer (obvious to all...). Any interest in doing a get 
together probably at the 4 screen drive in in N. Smithfield RI (20 min north 
of Prov) on 146? I'm thinking of heading there with the family sometime in 
the next couple of weeks.
