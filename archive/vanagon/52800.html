Subject: Re: Dead Deer on a Syncro

Now, I may be wrong, but I think deer only have 'sex&quot; when the female deer,
doe's, are in heat (horny), and I think that happens only once a year in the
fall.

  Based on this, I think most of you bucks out there would run across the
highway into oncoming traffic to chase your doe if  she only was in heat once
a year !

sucks to be a deer.
