&lt;&lt; Ryan, 
Interesting information.  But it seems that it should be easy to tell if the
brochure is from VW or not.  I think I remember seeing a magazine article on
a one-off van from Koenig or someone else from around 85 or 86 that was like
the van you describe.

Jim Davis &gt;&gt;

I'm sure the brochure is genuine VW (back page, bottom left shows VW logo and
VAG), but I was wondering if this really went into production and approx. how
many were made.  Just like trying to purchase a used westy poptop, I suspect
trying to get these interior parts would be an exercise in frustration &lt;g&gt;.

Ryan
