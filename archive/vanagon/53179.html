Item Subject: FS in NC: 91 Syncro Westy - w/ sunroof!
     What does a Westy with a sunroof look like?  Where is it . . . over 
     the luggage rack or poptop?  Any one seen one of these?
     
     Regards,
     
     Vince.

Sure wish I could buy this; maybe one of you can:
     
1991 Vanagon Syncro Westfalia
72k miles
a/c, cruise, sunroof $16,500
919-393-7890
     
I spoke to one of the owners briefly and yes, it does have both a/c and 
a sunroof...
     
That's about all I know of it - I saw it advertised in today's Raleigh 
_News &amp; Observer_. Oh yeah - the color is champagne w/ silver, or vice 
versa. 
&gt;Oh well, it's just a material thing. I don't NEED it.
