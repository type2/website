Subject:      1993 Eurovan GL

I'm an unhappy Eurovan owner!  I'vew owned a VW since I was 16!
But buying a 93 Eurovan ranks #1 in mistakes I've made thus far.  It's
been a nightmare.  What do you know about these vans?

Here's a list of problems I've had:
A/C blew up twice
Rear A/C replaced twice
Headlights collect water (replaced 3x)
Body panels rusting at the seams (painted 2x)
Paint peeling off (gettting ready to paint again)
Side window decals &quot;balling up&quot; (replaced twice then repainted &quot;dull
black&quot;
A/C makes a &quot;wheezing noise&quot; (usually before it BLOWS UP)

I should've pursued the lemon law on this one....oh well!

Any advice or similar stories?
