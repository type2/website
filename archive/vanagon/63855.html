Subject: Mysterious idle

I've been trying to fix the gremlin in my '88 Vanagon that likes to make the
thing
idle at 2200RPM. (But will go to a normal idle if you blip the throttle.)

I checked the cable and return spring, all normal.
I checked the idle stabilizer valve. It hums and buzzes (quietly) and there
is 12V at
the connecting wire.

I did notice that the PO's shop had neglected to replace the metal clamps on
the rubber hoses that make up the air distribution plenum and intake
manafold. Of the 8 clamps only 2 were left.

Could this cause an air leak which would give a wacky idle?
