Subject: VW SA Address, raising alternator charge voltage

Hi

Well this was an easy one. VW SA headquarters are at

P.O. Box 80
Uitenhage
6230
South Africa

Ask if you want the phone # :-)

What follows is speculation:

The regulator is set up to &quot;see&quot; a fixed voltage, say 13.8V. It controls the
alternator to set this voltage. If you were to supply the regulator with
less that the full alternator output voltage, the regulator would raise the
alternator output to bring the input to the regulator back up to 13.8V.

Resistors can be used to drop the voltage, but the drop over a resistor is
proportional to the current (In this case the current drawn by the
regulator, and also by the alternator field) Using a diode, transistor or
zener diode would be a better idea. A diode has a drop of close to 0.7V for
a large range of current. Make sure the diode can handle a couple of amps, I
would say try a stud mounting diode (which has to be insulated)

Lets try some ascii art:

Clear as mud, right? :-)

Anyway, if somebody wants to try this hair-brained scheme out, feel free.
