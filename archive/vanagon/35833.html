Welcome Rich!

Ah, let me just look over your shoulder at this beast...

Hmmm...rust visible in three area, suspicious (new?) undercoat
in the wheel wheels, and high miles. Sounds like the PO
did not go for a full rebuild when recent engine problems surfaced,
I wonder why?  A/C is a real expensive mess to retrofit, and a real plus
IMHO.  Price sounds good, but lots of potential problems.
I'd keep on looking - enjoy the thrill of the chase!
