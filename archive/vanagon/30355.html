&gt;  Has anyone installed

&gt;Would it be a big problem to do this? 

I don't know the function of the left-side air intake louvers, but the right
side is where the engine gets its intake air.  You surely wouldn't want to
block this off.


&gt;Second question, when I look at the heat guage on the dashboard, where 
&gt;is it getting the reading from?  In other words, where is the sensor.

The temperature sensor is mounted in the thermostat housing that is bolted to
the front of the left head.  It's easy to see that this appendage would cool
down much quicker than the mass of the main engine body.
