Subject: RE: Correction : Help in Madison,WISC!!


Hi,

&gt; &gt; I'm planing to love in this baby for a couple of years, so anyone 
who helped
me out would be doing me a big favor (and I'd be delighted to take you out for
a thank you dinner if it worked out!!).

&gt; Should read :
&gt; I planning to LIVE in this baby!!!

 Hey, there's no need for pessimism: you might get lucky!

	W.
