&gt;&gt; And other bad news, my case was bad :( so I have to cough up an extra
&gt;&gt; $150 for that :( :( :(  unless I can come up with another case, and then
&gt;&gt; _I_ have to take it apart, and they'll charge me $25 to clan and check it,
&gt;&gt; and if that one is bad, too, then I'm still screwed :( :( :(  
&gt;
&gt;Is that $150 for a new case or a used one?  If new, I would go for it.
&gt;If used, I would try to get a new one or find one yourself.

My new motor has a NEW as41 case, NEW SP heads, and a really nice 6V 200mm
flywheel (used)  Its the nices 6V flywheel I have ever seen.  You vintage
guys will understand!

The $150 is 'cause he can't use my case to sell to someone else in a motor.

BTW - The insurance co just wrote me a check for $3200 to fix the porsche,
but boy am I tempted!  Hmmm  New motor, new trans, clutch :) :) :) :)
(signing) &quot;I'm in the money!&quot;
