Subject: need help with coolant leak


I've looked in the Bentley, but this part is too small to be mentioned I 
think.  There's a coolant hose that runs from the expansion tank to a 
diamond shape fitting on the right cylinder head.  This &quot;diamond&quot; piece 
is about 2 inches wide, and the hose attaches in the middle.

THis description isn't very precise, but I hope someon knows what I'm 
talking about.  ANyway, there's coolant leaking at the point where this 
piece meets the cylinder head.  Do I need to replace this piece, or is 
there a gasket between this piece and the head?  I've been told that this 
piece can break (is it plastic?), but as I said, I don't really know what 
to call it.  I think somethinge may have happened in the cold yesterday 
to cause this problem.  By the way, it's an '87.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

david
