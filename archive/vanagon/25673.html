Subject: Syncro Front Drive I.D.

Finally....I'm back on the list and also doing something about my front
drive. Got through the summer, but now that winter's coming, I've got to get
front diff and driveshaft back in shape!

I've located a source of new front drives, but the designation on the units
is &quot;ADM&quot;, which is different from what Bentley and mine show. Does anyone
know what this desig. might mean?  Locking capability? Or different gear
ratio? John, at Weddle Engr., couldn't find the answer, so I told him there
might be someone on the list that would know. Sure would be great if it would
work in my '87. And it might be a source for you fellow syncro owners who
ever need help.

Great to be back!....now if I can keep up with the mail!


Dan
