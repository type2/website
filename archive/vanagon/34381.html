&gt;Hi folks, I'm still off the list, but in need of advice.  Tonight's minus 15

&gt;(or so) Minneapolis weather seems to have taken the life of my clutch ('84 
&gt;Vanagon).  There is no resistance at all when I depress the pedal.  Once 
&gt;during the past two evenings, I noticed my clutch seemed to be partially 
&gt;frozen.  I got some resitance only when I pressed the pedal much farther 
&gt;down than it usually seem to begin to catch (did that make sense).  So it 
&gt;may be frozen: I usually put it in gear after I've turned it off, so the 
&gt;last thing I did was depress the clutch pedal to park it.  I just rolled 
&gt;over 100,000 miles, so it could have snapped too.    I'm wondering if anyone

&gt;on the Vanagon list has experienced subzero effects on their Vanagon clutch,

&gt;or any other part of the beast.  Since I'm off the list, please respond 
&gt;directly....
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance, and happy winter!

Sounds like clutch master or slave cylinder lost fluid.  Cold weather
contribted but not complete cause.  Look for brake fluid leaks. See Bentley
manual for details.
