Subject: Re: Gen Int: A Plea for Sanity (long but worth it).

While I sympathize with anyone who finds the traffic here on vanagon
a problem, I suspect suggestions that an elaborate system of coding
Subject lines will be rejected by the list owner and the general list
population.  The lack of structure is one of a mailing lists strengths,
in my opinion.

I will offer my method of dealing with the volume of posts, however.

I read the vanagon list through the vanagon web-page maintained at
http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/vanagon-list/ by Skip Montanero,
skip_at_automatrix_dot_com.  This allows me to scan subjects and read those that
interest me and ignore those that don't.  Also, when weeks go by that I
cannot deal with the list traffic, I can go back and catch up.

I appreciate this service Skip provides us Type II nuts.
