Subject:      just to add to the tire thread...

I have a camper and I have 1 year old MXLs on them. They have functioned well
for me but I think mine say 36 PSI not 40. I can also say that they do feel a
damn sight better when not inflated to max. At Westphalia Wanderers meet two
weekends ago, we talked about the tire thread. Most of those who have used
truck tires did not like them. Without exception, they felt they didn't last
very long nor did they handle as well. Keep in mind these folks are retired
(for the most part) and put some hellaceous miles on their campers. Well, not
exactly scientific but one more tidbit for the tray...
