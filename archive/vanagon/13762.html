Subject: RE: alternator light on

sounds like there may be a significant voltage drop along one of your 
circuits.  To test this get a long wire (the length of the van) and hook
one end to the voltage regulater output.  With the other end (while eng.
running) touch the terminal on the lights, then the ignition, and other
points along the way (fuse box connections) Use your wiring schematic
to apporch this in some longical fashion.  The test wire should be fairly
large in diameter (10-14 gauge).  When testing ciruits have them loaded-
lights on, wipers going, etc.  be carefull not to short out the VR or alt.
