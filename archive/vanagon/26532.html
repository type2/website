Subject: RE: '80 Vanagon getting chopped.


&gt;I had fun driving the Vanagon around during the last month, I put about
&gt;1000 miles on it.
&gt;    &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;My roommate finally finished cutting up his car in the driveway, so I get
&gt;to move the Vanagon in and start on it this weekend.

Uh... too many cars on the road, maybe?
No, let me guess... you're... testing a new torch. A LOT.

Remind me to park a long way away from your house.



&gt;I really think VW should have put out a performance edition of the
&gt;air-cooled Vanagon.  After driving Martha's and this one, I think they're
&gt;a bit on the doggish side.  They should have made an option with beefed up
&gt;suspension, and an engine with about 2.5-3.0 liters.

They should have started doing that in about 1954! It wouldn't have
been optional for long!   :)

Wheeeee... is it Friday yet?
