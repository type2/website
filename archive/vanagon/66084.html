&lt;&lt; Oh wise ones,
 Someone recently told me that due to a law in California in 1991 which
 required all catalytic converters on new vehicles to have something called
 a constant monitoring device (?), all Vanagons sold in California
 in 1991 were really '90s (or identified as such), since VW knew they
 were phasing them out and didn't want to bother with the change.
  Any truth to this?
  Also, I thought i read somewhere that power windows &amp; locks were standard
 on '90s &amp; '91s, but i've found one that does not have them...what gives?
  thanks

Interesting question.  I THINK there may be some truth to this.  Here in CA,
I've seen some 1990 Vanagons with the Tornado Red 1991-only color.  Perhaps
this is because they were badged 1990, but were actually part of the 1991
model year run?
