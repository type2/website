Subject: RE: NC campout this weekend

&gt; Just a reminder for anyone interested that we are doing another camp
&gt;out at Umstead Park in Raleigh. We will be in the family camping
&gt;section, as of 4:30 or so Saturday afternoon. I would be so happy if
&gt;those planning to make it would let me know.
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Richard

It's these letters that make me mad &gt;:-(
I used to live within walking distance of the entrance to Umstead Park
