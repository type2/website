Subject: 84 westie runs hot in slow traffic
Date: Tue, 29 Apr 97 15:39:38 -0500
From: Sam Moore &lt;samoore_at_shellx.best_dot_com&gt;

My 84 westie runs hot in the summer in slow traffic.  This makes me 
really anxious, with summer comming on.  Also if I have to climb a long 
mountain in a low gear it happens.
If I turn the heat on it helps, but this is not a good answer.  
Additionally: It is the gauge that goes up the overheat light doesn't 
come on.

Is there a way to add a manual override on the radiator fan?
Once the fan kicks on things get better?

Should I put an inline helper pump in?

Thanks,

Sam Moore
