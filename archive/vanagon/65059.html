Subject:      Camper meet East of LA next weekend?

A local acquaintance called me this AM with sketchy info regarding a
meet/campout for VW campers to be heald in a location &quot;east of Los Angeles&quot;
next weekend. Can anyone assist? I haven't had a sleepless zillion mile road
trip to So Cal in two weekends and I am almost rested up... ;-)
BTW: I don't think it is *in* East LA so please spare the ribbing! =)

Likewise, I will post the proper info if and when I get it...
