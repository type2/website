Been there and done it on my 73.  Had a general dribble leak coming from the 
gas tank comparment somewhere when I got the van.  Removed the fire wall at the 
front of the engine comparment and found a rubber elbow conecting up to the 
overflow tube of the fuel filler had rotted out.  Even had a part number on 
it and surprise the dealer actually had one in stock.  Sticks out the rear 
upper face of the tank and is easy to fix and see once the firewall is out.  
To take the firewall out you should know that there are 2 screws that you get 
at from underneath the car on either side of the transaxle on the lip that hold 
the bottom edge of the fire wall in.  I thought it was worth fixing since the 
transaxle is magnessium and I don't like dribbling fuel on it, especially with 
the starter right there (ie source of sparks).

&gt; &gt;When I first got the '72 whenever I filled it up a large amount of gas would
&gt; &gt;leak.  Found out that a rubber &quot;elbow&quot; on top of the gas tank had
&gt; dry-rotted.
&gt; &gt; It didn't cost much for a new elbow and it was easy to replace.  Getting to
&gt; &gt;was another matter though (Step 1:  Take out engine).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This may be the exact problem I'm having with my '75!  Gas doesn't *visibly*
&gt; leak, but I get a gas smell in the cab every time I fill it up and take a
&gt; corner - lasts for 50 miles or so.. I thought the tank itself was leaking -
&gt; it is not the rubber gasket at the filler.  A leaky hose was found and
&gt; relaced by my mechanic (no fixee), and friend has opined that it may be the
&gt; &quot;overflow tube&quot; (where that is, I don't know...) allowing fumes into the bus.
&gt;  Otherwise, I'm clueless until I do Step 1 above - and for *that* investment
&gt; of work, I'll LIVE with the smell!...
