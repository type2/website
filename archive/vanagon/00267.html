Hello all!
        Well, I did finally fit a 70 amp alt in my 79 bus. It war a tough one
        though. The 70 amp'er is a little bigger and the fresh air duct
        (cooling) is a different shape. So anyway, I replaced the alt/voltage
        regulator/ and all of the appropriate wiring and the sucker still
        didn't work. Several weeks pass and I find the time to try again. In
        the wiring harness between the amp and VR there was a cold connection.
        I never checked the thing before I put it in because it was all new
        wire, etc... There was a fault in the stupid D+ wire from the from the
        factory!!!!! Moral check all of your connections prior to install, and
        if you forget, goto the guy at radio shack and bitch him out for selling
        you bad wire 8)

        There is a question in all of this, anybody have an idea of how much
        juice the car needs with no accesories on (for ignition etc...)? And
        how many amps does the battery need to maintain a full charge? If
        anyone has or can get any electrical info/data for me I will be
        greatful. I am setting up a camper/travel car w/ lots of accesories
        and am trying to modify the existing electrical system to get the most
        juice. Anybody use a 2nd battery in their Westy? (or any other car for
        that matter) Have any brilliant camper mod's you've seen?
