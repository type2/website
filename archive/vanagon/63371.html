I know the feeling.  I took two steps to save $$$

1.      Had good luck w/Indian Vic _at_ Madras Motors in California for a
headlight ass'y.  IndianVic_at_aol_dot_com

2.      For new stuff, I joined the VW CLub, since our local dealer gives 10%
on parts.  So, $420 saves $42, membership is $25, &amp;You get a wunnerful
