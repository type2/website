Subject: 4 sale, Auburn, CA


Heard about this one thru the grapevine:

For sale in Auburn CA:  '90 westfalia, manual transmission, air
conditioning, one original owner, 32K miles, burgandy (bordeaux).

I haven't seen the car and don't know the owner, but he is:

Max Brown  _at_  916.823.8017

When I talked to him, he said he didn't have an idea yet what
the car was worth.  He also said that he's not had problems
with leaking head gaskets.

FWIW...
