Subject: Re: waving

Lately,  I've been having more luck getting other Vanagon owners to wave.
 Heck, I've even had older Busses wave at me recently.   Let's face it, many
of us owned split window or Bread Loaf busses before we bought our Vanagons.
 I've owned 3 split windows and 2 bread loafs.  I still own and drive a 71
with a BIG upright engine...  It's a real &quot;kick in the butt&quot; (lots of fun).

It helps if you have a few toys on the roof or on the trailer.

I can verify that Acura owners do not wave at each other.....  I own an 87
Legend, and I can't even get another owner to look sideways!!!

Lately, I've been towing my new Gas Gas Trials Motorcycle (from Spain)
around.  You should see the necks crank around with that behind the Syncro!

Too many toys?

      Congrats on your find.   In May, I traveled all the way to GA/SC to 
      buy my '91 Westfalia.  I share your glee.
      
      Actually, if it isn't required to wave, it should be!  Having driven a 
      &quot;splittie&quot; for 10 years, I got used to waving and/or flashing the 
      headlights at every other &quot;splittie&quot; I saw; often, the other driver 
      would beat me to it.
      
      Years ago, I had a '71 Westfalia - same phenomenon.
      
      There's a tendency for Westfalia owners, no matter what the vintage of 
      their vehicle, to flash and/or wave at one another.
      
      Keep doing it.  It's the &quot;secret handshake&quot; of our ken.
      
      BTW, do Acura owners flash and wave at each other?  I rest my case.
