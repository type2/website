To All--
I've found that doing the NEATO newsletter, Old Bus Review, can be quite 
a chore. I also know that you don't need a lot of members to produce a 
quality journal/newsletter, but it does take work in pursuing potential 
writers. But to produce something fancy does take more money, and I've 
often wondered if there were enough Type 2 enthusiasts out there willing 
to support advertisers, etc. 

The day may come though for NEATO/LiMBO and other clubs to merge. .  or 
at least to combine efforts on a magazine or project of some sort.

It can be done! But as Jim says, it needs leadership, energy, etc.
I would love to be a part of it, but only a part. . .

&gt; All that is needed for your idea to fly is an &quot;editor&quot;.
&gt; Someone who will sift through the chaff, locate the nuggets
&gt; of wisdom, seek and recieve the appropriate permission,
&gt; format the text, correct the spelling and grammar, track
&gt; down corresponding photographs or diagrams, find a
&gt; publisher, review the proofs and, and, and.  Sounds like
&gt; work.
