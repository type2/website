Ajax laments:
&gt; The after-market cruise on my 87 Westy is blown. 

I have a set of installation and adjustment instructions for an 
aftermarket cruise that i've seen on several VW products.  I believe 
it has a trouble shooting section.  If i can find it i will mail a 
copy to up to 5 individuals.  

As an aside, cruise is worthless on a 1.9L wasserboxer with auto.  
Does it work on the 2.1L with manual?
