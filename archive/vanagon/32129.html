A friend of mine has a set of 16&quot; wheels off a '48 bug for sale (they are 
the same aren't they?).  Don't get excited yet--they need to be restored 
in a huge way.  One of the wheels is dented 
and two of them need the centers welded back in.   If you (or anybody 
else on the list) can't find a better set let me know and I'll see what 
he wants for them and what it will cost to ship.
