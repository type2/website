&gt; Electric Cars are being touted as THE alternative to the internal

That's already been addressed.  The problem with gasoline burning 
vehicles is that there are a lot of them in urban areas.  Like the bay 
area and LA.  It will help alleviate the pollution levels in the high 
density population areas by moving the power production to other areas.
Also, the power manufacturing methods are generally not with 
hydrocarbons, but by claiming natural power like rivers (w/dams) or 
nuclear (did I spell that right?).

&gt; To convert to having a majority of electric vehicles is going
&gt; to mean a major increase in the generating capacity of this
&gt; country. That means new generating plants....more use of
&gt; either fossil or nuclear fuels. Couple that with the idea
&gt; that electrical generation under conventional methods is
&gt; not all that mechanically efficient...and, by the way, neither
&gt; is recharging batteries. So there is a double whammy effect
&gt; here.

True, they will need to produce more electicity to fuel the vehicles.  
And that may even mean an increase to the typical houshold.  But that's a 
long way in the future.  The current technology is not suited for 
electric cars, so I don't see it being a problem for now.

&gt; If we are going to have alternative power sources for our cars,
&gt; I don't believe &quot;plug in&quot; electrical vehicles are a long term
&gt; answer....a technology such as fuel-cell or solar cell is...
&gt; but as Bob said in his first posting, big industry decides
&gt; what is good for us. And what bigger industry is there than
&gt; the power industry!

Well, solar cells are very inefficient, and so are batteries.  I don't 
think totally electric cars will be viable until they can go at least 200 
miles.  And that's about double what they can do today.

I thought the coolest idea was the 4x4 that had electric power on the 
rear wheels with a generator as back up.  Got 40mpg with the generator.
And had the stock engine still hooked up the the fron wheels.
