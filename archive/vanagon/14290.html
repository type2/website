Subject: Need Information about Eurovan(s)

I posted this privately (trying to be quiet and hide my ignorance) but have learned my 
lesson. I now have to go the full route. ;)

I have only one VW van (the Eurovan) and have not been around any others.

Since I didn't see any in California while out there, I'm guessing perhaps I have a 
strange beast on my hands.

MY SITUATION:

	There is a rocker switch mounted just to the left of  the center air vent.
	There is a letter &quot;S&quot; on the switch (nothing else).
	The switch is located above the rear-defroster &amp; air circulation switches.
	There is no mention of this in the manuals.
	When I press the switch (&quot;on&quot; position) the &quot;S&quot; lights.
		I detect nothing else happening.

MY QUESTIONS:

	Does this switch exist any any other Eurovan or VW vehicle?

	What is this switch supposed to do?
