Subject: damage assessment, please, on '78 bus

Friends of experience,

     It: '78 standard bus with sunroof.

  Where: Massachusetts.  Massive road salt and
         yawning potholes.

  Event: I've hit a pothole hard (while dodging a
         fallen light pole).

Discussion:

After hitting this hole at 35mph, a tremendous
shimmy, a hard pull to the right, and a relatively
quick stop.

Inspection is easy.  With nomenclature taken from
Bentley, the right front axle end plate, i.e., the
heavy stamping that attaches to the body, is
shattered all the way around.

&gt;From the looks of things up close and personal,
this stamping has been welded before (as in cracks
filled).  Not clear to me how well what is left is
holding the axle in position, though the wheel
obviously has shock and steering connections still
intact.  All shattered edges show rust (though none
of this was obvious in November when I &quot;Golenized&quot;
the wheel well, etc.).

Car drives ~ok, which is to say I have driven it 
the 5 miles home at &lt;30mph with nothing unusual
except that even light braking pulls right.

Obviously, this is important, and as I have neither
&quot;two helpers&quot; nor the &quot;VW610 front-axle supporting
adapter&quot; Bentley says are essential for my health,
this will be a shop job.

What should I look for?  Both diagnostic pointers 
(what else should be inspected) and therapeutic
pointers (how much to replace while the axle is off)
would be very timely.

Needless to say, I need this like a hole in the head...
