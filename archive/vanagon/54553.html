Why won't it work? Remember the purpose of a fuse is to protect the wiring
and equipment in the circuit. If the 100w bulb draws 7.6 amps it is below
the rated current carrying capacity of the wire. Also I ran 140w bulbs in
my 72 bus and never blew a fuse or wire and didn't have unusually short
bulb life. My advice is go ahead and use them. IMHO

&gt;&quot;Will my wiring handle almost twice the current?&quot;. I doubt it.

&gt;, the 55W bulb draws 4.2 ampswhile the 100W bulb draws 7.6 amps. 
&gt;&gt;Anyway, don't forget the original question :)  .  Can I safely put 
&gt;&gt;100W
&gt;&gt;H3 bulbs in a light made for 55W H3 bulbs?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks all,
