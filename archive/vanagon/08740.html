&gt; &gt; Bad part - they did NOT make an effort to integrate all the stray notes and
&gt; &gt; &quot;Changes to the 19xx Edition&quot; stuff - you are still led on wild-goose
&gt; &gt; often circular references with little payoff  (maybe this is a semi-adult
&gt; &gt; version of &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot;) and most of the newest changes have little to
&gt; &gt; do with Vanagons or earlier Type II's.
&gt; 
&gt; You have to remember that that book is for air-cooled vehicles only.  So
&gt; you won't see any reference to water-cooled versions of anything in there.
&gt; The air-cooled Vanagons are similar enough to the '79 buses that it probably
&gt; takes care of those too.  But your right about the hunting around bit.
&gt; Does anyone out there know if the Idiot Guide covers the fuel injection
&gt; system for those early air-cooled vanagons?

The Idiot's Guide has had its place in sun, but now there are better manuals
for later VW editions including the 1980-83 Hayne's and the Bentley (if
you can afford it). And of course there is the 1995 edition of this lists
on-line q/a soon to be published.......DC
