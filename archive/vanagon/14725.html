&gt;Does anybody know the book value for a 1991 Multivan.  The books I looked in
&gt;have no listings for Multivans.  When I checked elswhere on the net
&gt;where the Vins were explained the was no &quot;T&quot; for Multivan.
&gt;Does anybody know the value of a Multivan vs Camper vs Vanagon?

my NADA book from last year (april 94) also has no listing for the Multivan,
but they do have a listing for the Carat (which i think was about the same
price). this is the Southeastern edition, however, and other regions will be
different:
