Subject: Re: RE: ODD Squeaking sound

&quot;Just got off the road from a drive in my  Vanagon, any excuse to take a ride
in 
it. I noticed a small squeek from somewhere in the dash board.  My other
Vanagon 
made this same noise but to a lesser extent, any ideas out there?&quot;

&quot;mouse maybe&quot;

--------

did i mention my rodent stowaway i found in my bug?   I had had intermittant
starting problems, isolated it to the battery dying, and took it back to
Sears as the battery was still under warranty.   I noticed then that some of
the insulation around the heat tube under the seat on the left hand side was
a bit frayed, so a couple days later i went to fix it hoping for increased
heat.  I pulled out the old stuff, and an indignant mouse ran out of it,
through the hole the battery cable ran through to the starter, then turned
around and looked at me.  Jeez!   I went to go get some big o clamps, to tie
down the new insulation, taken from under a bus, with extra padding.  The o
clamps were the big ones for replacimg the trans boots.  Okay, so i go back
to the bug and the mose runs back to the battery cable, leaving its tail in
the under seat area.  I poked at it with a screw driver.  Hmm.  Well, the nug
heated up better with that, and I keep meaning to leave a trap
