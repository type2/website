Subject: Re: Why do we all love our &quot;bricks&quot; so much? 

I've been doing a little pondering on this subject since I first 
read the original post.  It's very hard to put a finger on exactly 
why I put up with an underpowered and underheated vehicle that my 
'80 Westy is.  However, when I jump into the driver's seat the 
thing just seems to fit just right.  When I cruise around, I know 
I'm driving a vehicle that to me is a bit unique in a world of 
cookie cutter sameness in other autos.  It just feels cool to drive 
this thing around and go camping in places some cars can't.

Just a few thoughts, disjointed as they may be.

Phil
