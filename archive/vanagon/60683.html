Subject: And speaking of BusBoys...

And speaking of BusBoys...  Has anyone heard from them recently??

I've tried e-mail (both addresses), faxing and calling to a busy
number for a week.  Still no response...

&gt; I'd like to hear about experiences  too.   I've just ordered the lowered

&gt; I've installed them.
