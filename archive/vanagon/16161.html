Volks,
	I just got off the phone with Bill Baumann, the guy responsible for
Busses By The Arch (BBTA).  This event will mark the start of the GNATT
tour, and is going to be held the weekend of May 26-28th about 30 miles
West of St. Louis, MO.  I will be there, along with (hopefully) Ryan McGee
and a couple of others.

	This event sounds like a lot of fun.  Bill has been organizing 
this event for 8 years now, and he says it just gets better every year.
There is a fee of $20 which includes just about everything, including
a camping spot for the weekend.  He expects at least 80 busses to be there,
with an awards ceremony, video viewings, campfires, and a road trip that
includes a ferry ride across the Mississippi! 

	I am posting this information in hopes that those that can't make
the GNATT tour might at least be able to make it for BBTA.  I think it
sounds like a lot of fun.  Joel, can you make it?

	If anyone needs more info about BBTA, please let me know and I will
be happy to supply it.  Bill Baumann is sending me a flyer with information
on it - I will post it when I get it.

-David
