&lt;description of difficulties and battery swap deleted&gt;
&gt;battery and ZOOM- the van started wonderfully, and off I went back to work.
&gt;About an hour later when I tried to start it again, I got the same
&gt;
&gt;Anyone venture an explanation? The starter is old and draws too many amps?
&gt;The compression is so wonderful that when the engine is warm its
&gt;difficult to crank over? The timing needs to be reset? Sun spots?

ok. i'm all wound up today, so i'll take a shot at it. let's see what we've
got:
1. van has been doing this since you got it?
2. runs fine once cranked. this would (to me) eliminate the timing.
3. new battery seems to solve problem, but doesn't.
4. starter turns over, but is really slow ... but then picks up and cranks
   the car.

so a new battery had the strength to really spin the starter, but then the
battery got too weak to do it right. hmmm. ok, what about doing this:
* really really check the battery cable connections. especially the ground
  connection from the battery to the body (that un-insulated brass-looking
  cable). this is probably not the whole problem (or you would have been
  seeing quirky electrical problems elsewhere, like with radio or lights).
* crawl up under the bus and double-check all the starter electrical
  connections ... see if anything is loose. be sure to check the tightness
  of the starter mounting bolts and nuts ... this is the starter completes
  the electrical circuit back to the battery (grounded through the chassis).

that's the cheap stuff that you can do yourself. if it's not a loose
connection causing a bad ground, the only other things i can think of are
* a battery drain somewhere ... something is still turned on and sucking
  power from the battery. this could be very hard to track down. you'd just
  have to got one circuit at a time. :(
* a bad alternator or voltage regulator (little gizmo in the back of the
  alternator). this could make the battery never get any replenishment ...
  and a border-line starter might weaken a battery enough to do what you
  describe.

that's all i can think of.
