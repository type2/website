&gt; Joel!  BRAVO!!!  &lt;clap clap clap&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; so let's all be careful out there, and come back again for another year.
&gt; &gt; and remember! improperly cooked turkey can make you do the Turkey Trot. :)
&gt; 
&gt; and now a word from your Health Department....  cook poultry to an 
&gt; internal temperature of 170 F, don't stuff the bird as it slows down 
&gt; the heat transfer and creates cool spots.
&gt; 
&gt; use a separate cutting board and knife (or just wash them well) for 
&gt; raw meat.
&gt; 

Also, don't forget to cover that gravy when not in use...
warm thick broth like that is the perfect breeding ground for micro-organisms


&gt; the BIGGEST reason some of us will get sick this holiday is because 
&gt; Aunt Harriet, who hasn't been feeling well recently, didn't wash her 
&gt; hands before buttering her buns.
