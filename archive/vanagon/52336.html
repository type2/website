&gt;&lt;&lt; How can I get the old pipes off, with the bolts, in order to simple
&gt; reinstall the same pipes?  Must I replace solid pipes just because I can't
&gt; get a rusted bot removed from it?
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;A lucky mechanice armed aith a torch, cut0off wheel, and chisels should be
&gt;able to separate the parts with little damage.  It takes practice.  I even
&gt;practice removing pipes that are to be thrown away.

&gt;  Thiis is TRUE!  I've taken many years to learn the chisel method, with
patience and understanding, one can do this job!

  I know I'm spoiled by living in a Salt road free area, but we have the
Pacific ocean (2 Blocks away) and that has it's drawbacks too!
