&gt;Don't knock'em 'till you've tried em...EuroVans that is...Oh shit...
&gt;Here we go again another potential EuroVan vs &quot;real VW&quot; &quot;discussion&quot;.

Ric, you Hideous Ignorant Slut.

trying to jump-start your feeble brain cells again, eh? well, this time it
won't work!  the rest of us are gonna ignore you while you rehash some tired
old argument with a poor innocent airhead. ;)

&gt;four (IMHO) is a poor imitation of a Subaru engine. It was nothing
&gt;more than a stop-gap measure.

then, on the other hand, if you're gonna start insulting people like that ...
who wants a car that you have to move the radiator to change spark plugs??? :)
sheesh. 'poor imitation', indeed!

&gt;a Vanagon, to the front radiator. Why do you think the failure rate
&gt;of waterpumps on Vanagons is so high? Bad design...Nope..its the
&gt;pump having to push all that water so far forward that kills them off.

bull-feathers. it doesn't have to 'push' the coolant any more than your
eurovan. besides, it has MORE coolant to carry the heat away, so it's better
able to handle hotter climates than your puny little 8 quarter. :P

&gt;any lit from Germany or Europe, you will see that it is the
&gt;safest, best constructed, and best selling van over there. They
&gt;probably sell more T4s there in a month than they did here in one year.

yeah, yeah, yeah. and Rush Limbaugh is Santa Claus. :P

&gt;&quot;Auto Motor und Sport&quot; - April 94. Safety - Gute Fahrt - April 91.
&gt;
&gt;As to &quot;gut feelings&quot;, I have owned beetles (still drive a 56),
&gt;T1 Typ 2s, Rabbits, Golfs (still drive an 86 GTI with 206k miles),
&gt;and the EuroVan, so I have a pretty good set of bench marks and

but NO vanagons! so bleah! :P

&gt;Typ 2 family...I just feel its my duty to defend its honor!

honor? :) Honor?  it's a machine, folks. (and a particularly funny-looking
one at that!) :)
