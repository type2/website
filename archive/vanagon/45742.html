&gt; If you saw this message, this line...
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; I'm planing to love in this baby for a couple of years, so anyone who
helped
&gt; me out would be doing me a big favor (and I'd be delighted to take you
out for
&gt; a thank you dinner if it worked out!!).
&gt; 
&gt; Should read :
&gt; 
&gt; I planning to LIVE in this baby!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; --

Personally, I liked it better the original way, And yes, dinner would be
an appropiate thank you.  ;-)

Happy camping.... Ron
