&gt;
&gt;  I'd like to add that you can really
&gt;save yourself some bucks by anticipating future expenses this way.  You
&gt;have time before you mishap to look for good buys on tires, batteries,
&gt;fan belts etc.

That's the idea behind preventative maintenance:  Rebuild/replace BEFORE
failure.  The airlines, the military, fleet operators -- anyone concerned
with reliability -- has always done it that way.  The trouble is, it takes a
little pre-planning and looking ahead, alien concepts to most American car
owners.
