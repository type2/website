Subject: Type IV Puma / V6

I get the digest, no quotes...

Alistair asked something like 'Type IV in Puma? Fit &amp; finish? Interior? 
Handling? V6-&gt;conversion?'

Yes, the type IV is in the Puma. Which is not a kit car in South Africa. 
The factory has drifted around a bit, this one was built in Durban in 
'74. Basically a glassfibre shell on a beetle pan. Carpeting inside, you 
sit quite close to the pan, so there's little upholstery. You can fit a 
console around the tunnel, but that limits the space (I'm 6'2).

Handling? Well, it's a swing axle beetle :) Centre of gravity is lower 
though, but I won't take on porsches.

The Ford V6 conversion is _very_ popular here. Anything can get one, even 
splittys. Except I prowl the streets wanting to shoot people who do that. 
They just tack on a radiator above the front bumper. Mostly with a 
mercedes grill. The new Microbusses are easier, since they have a 
radiator already. Microbusses are available with the 1800 golf/jetta 
engine or the 2.5i 5cyl audi engine. The gearboxes on these seem to take 
the strain better than the older Kombi's. And they're all called Kombi's 
here, so don't anybody start another war :) BTW that's the 3l +- 100kW 
Ford engine, we get them in Ford Cortinas, Sapphires, etc, dunno what you 
have over there...

So how come _I'm_ answering all the questions? Somebody must be able to 
tell me how to fix the d**n engine! :)
