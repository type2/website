Subject: Maiden voyage (return)

Hey all,

We just got back from our maiden voyage in the 73' camper.  It ran like a 
charm.  We decided against New Mexico mid trip and instead headed through 
Michigan into Canada, around the north part of Lake Superior back to 
Duluth, MN.

On the way down to Noblesville Indiana we had a little trouble in 
Chicago.  We left after my sisters wedding at 11:00 pm and drove strait 
for 14 hours.  It ran great at 65 for most of the night (the outside temp 
was around 45-50).  Just out side 
of Chicago I started getting terrible gas milage.  We stopped for gas at 
one of the oasis stations and when I started it again it was running 
really rough and missing.  It seems that the ajustment to the fuel 
injection (that bar that connects the throttle and the fuel system) was 
out of wack.  The motor was really hot.  So I let it cool for about a 
hour and tried to reajust the idle.  It worked.  From then on I didn't 
drive faster than 60mph and never had the problem again.

Is this what they call vaper lock?  I felt that I was pushing it a little 
hard.  Lesson learned.  

By the way, the drive from Seu St. Marie (sp) to Thunder Bay Ontario is 
one of the most spectacular views I've ever seen and the provincial 
parks are great.  Most are right on the beach.  I saw a bunch of busses 
in Ontario and most waved back.

Now its time for after trip maintainence.  Tomarrow I leave on another 
(shorter) camping trip.  This time for work, to complete a folklore 
project in Northern Minnesota.

Driving up highway 31 in Indiana I saw a old farm with multiple busses 
in the yard.  One had a beetle welded on the roof.  Someone else on the 
list mentioned this, I think.
