Subject: re 97 EV questions

&gt;	I'm a newbie so don't hurt me.  I'm (I think) in the market
&gt;for a 95-96 EV camper, but I'm tempted to take the plunge and go for
&gt;a new 97.  In my attempt to do an analysis, I have the following
&gt;questions:
&gt;
There was no '96, so its either the '95 Audi 5 or the '97 VR6.

&gt;1) Does the VR6 with the (must have) automatic still feel substantialy
&gt;stronger than the audi 5 with a 5 speed?
&gt;
Can't answer this one from experience. Have to get into the dealer some
weekend and see for myself, just out of curiosity.

&gt;2) Is the &quot;low speed traction control&quot; a new feature with the 97?
&gt;

Yes.

&gt;3) Does it work substantially better in snow?
&gt;

I don't know. I've talked to auto-geeks about ABS and Traction Control and
they like to point out that ABS at least causes problems at low-speed in
snow.
(The reason is you cannot do that &quot;snow plow&quot; effect of locking the wheels
and sliding to a stop - which *is* effective at *low* speeds.)
Generally Traction Control works by braking the spinning wheel
individually, forcing power to go to the other wheel.
I've seen test reports that indicate its quite stunning - at least when
driving on plastic wetted down with soap!

I remain skeptical.

&gt;4) Any other noticable differences between 96 and 97?
&gt;

Well, a slightly used '95 is available (in Seattle at least) for around
$27-$28K. A new '97 costs $34K-$35K. A rear heater (for use while driving)
and a different way to fasten the removable seat down. Oh yeah, and dual
air bags ( how could I forget these timely devices!) Other than that, it
looks pretty much the same. Oh, the '97 has white bumpers and it says
&quot;Winnebago&quot; on top. Yuk.
