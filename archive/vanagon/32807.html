Subject: Hard shifts

Hi all. This is my first attempt at posting a message after spending 34,000
hours readin all the others! My first question - My beloved '86 syncro
Westy sometimes gets very hard to shift into first gear, say at a light. We
were cruising around central NH, saw two other vanagons - are you there?,
and towards the end of the trip the engagement into 1st got difficult. New
clutch at 103,000miles, now 113,000+ miles. Is it possibly the fluid?
Shiftless minds want to know. Tia. By the way , what is Flaps?
