Subject: Cuttin' a big ole hole in my roof...
Date: Thu, 16 Mar 1995 17:28:21 -0500

Greetings-
	
	Well, I've bitten off quite a huge project.  I bought a 1982 Westy, 
wrecked, that I planned on having a bodyshop repair for me.  It is, apparently,
buggered beyond repair.  At least that's what 3 bodyshops have told me.  So now
to Plan B:  Transfer all the neat Westy stuff to a non-Westy vanagon.  I can
handle all the mechanical and interior and wiring tasks, but I will have to farm
out the hole-cutting chores.

	My quesion:  How is the Westy reinforced to allow for (1) loss of
structural integrity due to the gaping absence of roof, and (2) the weight of
the upper bunk to be supported by the remaining bits of roof?

	One bodyshop has already agreed to cut the hole for me; I just want
to make sure I don't do anything unsound here.

Thanks,
--Dale
