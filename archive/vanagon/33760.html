Subject: RE: Wavering Wannabus

Jim asks a question that is the automotive equivalent of whether it's better
to marry for love or money.  Luckily automotive bigamy is not illegal.  I
think old German cars make wonderful second cars, not so good first cars.
My cars that need to run on Monday are Japanese: 87 Integra and 92 Sentra.
They are so close to zero maintenance (excepting oil changes) that I have
trouble answering when the Consumer Reports questionnaire asks who maintains
them.  With over 60k miles, the Sentra has gotten oil, filters, and new
brake pads.  That's it.  The Integra has over 120k.  It has had the same,
plus a new cam belt (old one looked new when it came out at 90k), some
new FI widget under warranty at 40+k, and the airco compressor died and
has been left dead.  That's it.

These cars are fun to drive but not indefinably magical like the Vanagon.
The Vanagon is a hobby.  As such, I don't want to HAVE to work on it, and
since it is higher maintenance than the Japanese cars, I would HAVE to 
work on it if I needed it every day.  Especially since working on it
means learning new skills, which takes an unpredictable amount of time,
this is a key issue.  I admire the skills of the Bobs and Bobs-to-be
who carry treadle-driven drill presses under the back seat just in case,
but I can't make that approach fit my 12-hours-a-day-in-suit-and-tie
career nightmare.

My next paragraph should be about what makes a Vanagon (or any bus) so
appealing, but I haven't figured it out yet.  On any quantifiable scale,
it's not THAT different from a Ford Clubwagon.  On some qualitative scale,
tho', there's nothing like.  My best guess is that it has to do with 
getting there before the front wheels do.  

Anyway, split your car budget in half and buy bulletproof little Hontoysans
that run forever, and a bus for fun.
