Subject: propane auto stop valves

Concerning auto stop valves,
                My experience with these auto stop valves is that they fail
prematurely and the people who fill our Westie tanks hate them with a
passion! Apparently there is more spillage and subsequent burning of flesh
from liquid propane! Anyway, I simply replaced this valve with an earlier
style  which were non auto stop. My '81 Westie had such a valve which was
easily available at the local RV supplier for  $35.00 you need to replace
the bleeder valve also which was another $10.00 or so. Good Luck!
