&gt; A locksmith can handle that. Locksmiths have this widget that they plug into
&gt; the cylinder where they can basically &quot;dial-a-key&quot;, at which point they can

What I would like to know is if its possible to go the other way 'round,
I have '56 Kombi with a not-the-original ignition, and I would like to put 
an early ignition switch in, and have a key made to match the doors.  Has
anyone ever done this or heard of it? How much does it cost?
