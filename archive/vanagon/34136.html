Subject: Leaking '70 tranny nose...

	Ladies and Gentlemen,
	So I started the '70's new ECI engine and let it idle
for a while while futzing with the electrical system. Previously
I've probably run the engine for no more than 5 minutes at a time.
This was more like 15 or 20, with occasional changes in throttle
since i've heard that steady running at only one RPM isn't good
for new engines. (ECI's paperwork doesn't recommend anything
specific but my Corrado's user's manual said not to cruise at
a steady speed but vary it for the first 1500 miles)
	After a while, I noticed oil dripping on the driveway, and
further inspection revealed it was coming from the nose of the tranny.
The truck is parked facing down-hill, and I guess the spinning
drive shaft warmed up and moved the oil around inside and
it found a way out.
	I presume there is a nose-gasket I should have replaced before
we put the engine in, sigh. Anyone here done this, know about it? 
Looks like I lost about a cup of oil sitting at idle for 20 minutes,
so when I get the lights working, the truck can be moved but
hardly used as a daily driver until this is fixed. Its raining again :(

	Bill
