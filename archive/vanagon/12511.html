  OFFICE MEMO          '85 in Sacramento sold-need help       Date:3/3/95

Well, I bought the 85 vanagon with the head off in Sacramento yesterday. As
Mike C. posted yesterday, this van isn't in &quot;pristine&quot; condition as
advertised. The body is pretty straight with a bunch of little scratches, but
really doesn't look too bad at all. The carpets are bad, though. covered with
mildew that will probably leave stains when after cleaning. This doesn't
matter as much to me, as my '87 does all our people moving, and this will be
more of a cargo van.
    I figure that for $800 (what we finally agreed on, considering the
interior), it's more than worth it just as a parts van. It's got brand new
Michelins on it, and hubcaps that are missing from my '87. Even if the engine
never runs, I'm not doing too badly.
    Mechanically, though, I'm starting to wonder what I've got myself into.
I've had the the heads off type 1 motors before, as well as US V8's but this
is my first experience with a wasserboxer. Overall I'm looking forward to the
challenge, but can I ask for some advice from you all out there that have done
this?
    The Bentley calls for some specific tools for removing and installing the
piston pins and compressing the rings to put the pistons in the liner. Are
these tools available? expensive? Anyone have them for sale or rent?
    I don't have any catalogs yet. What do you recommend as the least
expensive source for quality parts, such as gasket sets and sealer compound?
TIA for any help you can give me. I'm having it towed back to San Mateo (SF
Bay Area, an 85 mile tow) on monday, and will keep you updated on my trials.
