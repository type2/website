 Subject: **Are VW Buses a folk item?**

  VW Bus enthusiasts:
  I am conducting a study on VW buses as an item of American folk culture.
  I would appreciate any information anyone wants to share on what they
  have done to their buses inside and out which they feel represents a
  folk style or art.  For example: describe any hand made items or hand
  painted decorations and what they mean.
  I have a 71 Bus which started as a standard transport, I have since put
  camper equipment in it out of a 66 microbus and customized it.  I recently
  made some curtains from a sunflower material.  These modifications tell
  something of my wanderlust and need for travel.
  I feel there is indeed a culture and a set of ideas and beliefs among bus
  owners.  There is a reason why we choose such a vehicle over any other.
  Please give me any thoughts, feelings, descriptions, photos, etc. you feel
  may apply.  Respond soon, my report is due on 05/11/94.
  Thanks!,
  Ryan Egan
