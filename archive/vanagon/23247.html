Subject: 82 diesel westy

Hi You-all,

        My daughter and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Alaska (we
only had time to drive to Seattle) with my '82 diesel Westy.  Here are some
stats:

                1982 diesel Westfaila - total milage to date = 149000
(20,000 on second engine)

                drove it 6000+ miles

                problems: none

                oil:  1/2 qt. consumption total (one change, Mobil 1 15-50)

                max crusing speed:  58mph

                passed by everything including a Yugo!

                ave. mpg = 24

                price for fuel:  $0.98 low  to $1.40 high

I tried to fix everything before we left and it paid off.  We pulled a
small boat trailer to Wisconsin with no problem.  Westy managed to maintain
40mph going up even the most difficult mountains - I have finally found a
vehicle which suits my personality

RC
