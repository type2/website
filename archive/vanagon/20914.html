Subject: Vanagon Camper/Roof AC

&gt;Hi, I am one of those diesel-westy persons on the list. I've had the 
&gt;diesel for 6 years and it's been one of the most faithful vehicles I've 
&gt;owned. Trouble is, I just moved to Dallas some time ago and my wife and I 
&gt;became parents of twin daughters 2 weeks ago. I need a van with 
&gt;air-conditioning now.


Has anyone any idea if an RV type roof mounted unit would work for a 
Vanagon. There was a 13,500 BTU unit FS in the local classified, someone got 
it before I could check it out. 13.5K Btu is a lot of cooling power!  tim s.
