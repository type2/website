Hi,

despite the NNOOOOOO  list posting I've used the Prestone stuff on a
plugged up '85 vanagon and an '86 Audi.  Works fine, one year later in
the '85. No unexpected heater core or rad leaks. DPO tried to seal major
rust outs in coolant pipes with various crap.  Flushing with water until
it was clean helped, then I did the Prestone flush and got out masses of
grey oily water.  The rinse _did_ rinse out the system, way better than
plain water.

In both cases I got a slight lowering in operating temps when moving,
but much longer times before/between  the rad fan cutting in when
standing still at idle. Especially for the Audi.  When I first tried it
the garden hose could hardly push water through the rad.  After the
rinse it flowed freely.  Lots of big rust flakes from Audi (took five
rinses after flush to clear), lots of grey aluminium corrosion products
from the vanagon.  I used the liquid stuff, not the powdered crystal
stuff, it looked too viscious.

I'd say go for it. Will be doing my '87 shortly. Make sure the
thermostat is hot enough to open for each rinse, else you will just
flush the engine and heater cores, not the rad. You can splice a T
connection for flushing in up front near spare, into the heater hoses. I
wouldn't leave it in, potential weak link. I just yanked off the lower
rad hose to do mine however. Better.... get a bucket!

bye, Tim
