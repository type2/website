                       MurMuirs of Reality

I first encountered John Muir's 'Idiot' book at the Ft. Myer,
Virginia auto hobby shop, where I was building six six Volkswagen-
based aircraft engines for members of the local chapter of the
Experimental Aviation Association.  The owner of the book appealed
to me for help after attempting to cure a broken cam shaft by doing
a tune-up, an event not covered by the 'Idiot' book (and not all
that common in any case).

I was delighted with the book, especially the artwork, and
immediately bought a copy.  But as much as I admired what Mr. Muir
had done to demystify auto mechanics it took only a quick glance
through the text to make it plain the author was no mechanic.  For
example, he shunned ball joints and transmissions as being beyond
the pale of mortal man when the truth is just the opposite. 
Overhauling a tranny is easier, faster and less expensive than
overhauling an engine, and ball joints are a classic no-brainer:
Out with the old, In with the new; far easier than rebuilding king-
pins.

But what really bothered me was the number of safety-related
omissions and John's advocating the use of certain procedures that
caused expensive, permanent damage to the vehicle.  This lead to an
exchange of letters with John sometime in 1971.

When the four blind men examined the elephant the one who felt the
trunk was convinced elephants were like snakes, the one touching
the leg was sure they were like trees, and so on.  John's view of
automotive reality was similarly distorted.  Like the blind man
feeling the elephant's truck, John Muir failed to appreciate the
overall 'system' that is a Volkswagen, and like the blind man, John
had personal 'proof' of his conclusions:  Pounding on an axle nut
with a hammer and chisel does in fact cause it to come off.  But
any mention of the fatal damage inflicted to the bearing and
differential gear was beyond his comprehension, perhaps because
transmissions themselves were beyond his ken.  He also appeared to
have an inherent distrust of real mechanics.

A good mechanic is like a physician in that while we can not cure
every ill our first tenet is to cause no further harm.  John was
not a good mechanic.  I think he was a good writer, even a good
philosopher, but my grandmother was a better mechanic; she was
bright enough not to pound on things unless she knew it would not
make matters worse.  So while I'm sure John Muir was instrumental
in saving a large number of bugs and buses from the smelter, I'm
equally sure he was the direct cause of irreparable damage to a
number of others.  

(Loosening axel nuts with a chisel is a hold-over from the days of
steam and plain bearings.  The effect -- commonly called 'micro-
flats' -- of direct impact loads on shafts supported in ball or
roller bearings was explained by a series of articles in the SAE
Journal in the early 1950's.)

Another trait of a good mechanic is a willingness to learn; to test
new ideas and opinions.  The fact the current editions of the
'Idiot' books, which now cover just about every car known to man,
contain many of the errors found in the first edition makes it
painfully clear that whoever is running the store at John Muir
Publications feels no obligation toward veracity.

I continue to recommend the 'Idiot' book as an excellent means of
breaking down what may well be a cultural barrier; a feeling by
some that the sweat and dirt of honest labor is somehow demeaning. 
For despite his inaccuracies, omissions and hilarious mechanical
gaffs, John Muir did more than any one I know to make it clear that
each of us is in charge of our lives.  People often lose sight of
this fact as technology intrudes into the most mundane aspects of
everyday life, such as personal transportation.  In modern-day
America personal transportation is a virtual necessity, but for a
growing number of our population it is little more than a dream. 
John Muir showed how the dream could become reality by explaining
the Rites of Passage.  All you needed to do was sweat a little. 
And learn a lot.  All you needed to do was become your own
mechanic.

John Muir is dead.  Despite his admonition to 'Don't Think,' if his
books taught us anything it is the importance of learning; of
thinking for ourselves.  I think it would be an insult to his
memory to stop learning, to succumb to blind faith.  And while his
books contain errors, I'm sure they would have been corrected had
he lived.  I've a hunch he wouldn't mind at all if you took care of
that chore for him.
