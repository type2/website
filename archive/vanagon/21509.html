Subject: Repair manuals

I have the Bently manual for my '84 Westy.  I have found that it is a 
complete technical reference, but I would like another manual that might 
offer more in the way of repair procedures, something like the idiot's 
guide.  Does anyone know if there are any other manuals that cover the 
1984 Vanagons/Westys?
