Subject: running board for Vanagon Westi

Hi all,

Just back from a weekend in Monterey.  Managed to miss the CCCs at Kelley
Park show in San Jose.

Returned to a lot of email, and somewhere along the line, spotted on one of
several classified lists of VWs and parts for sale on the web, a listing of
an aluminum running board, along with a name I thought might be familiar
from this list.  The ad specified ease of attachment thru jack mounts, etc.
i failed to bookmark it, and was unable to find it again despite hours of
searching.

is there someone here who has such a running board for sale?  if so, please
post me, as i could find it quite helpful, depending on cost.

Thank you.

Gail
