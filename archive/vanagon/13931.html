  The short answer is: Any type IV engine &lt;'72 or later bus, any 914/4,
  411/412&gt; will fit. Caveats are: You will need the exhaust system, since
  the '79 heat exchangers are unique to that year &lt;I'm assuming that you'd
  have the '79 stuff&gt;. If your '79 originated in California the Fuel Injection
  ECU will be expecting an input from an oxygen sensor. The clutches increased
  in diameter as the engine displacement grew so you will need the one that
  matches the flywheel on the engine you get.
  I'd suggest a '78 or '79 2.0 if you can find it on account of the 
  hydraulic lifters.

&gt; I have found a '79 camper that I would like to buy. The only 
&gt; noticeable problem with it, besides the Ohio state body work  
&gt; (rust), is that it lacks an engine. I was wondering if anybody 
&gt; out there would know what size engine would work with 
&gt; the least amount of modifications to the existing manual 
&gt; transmission. The original 2.0l GE engine is a scarce comodity 
&gt; in these parts and seems to be very costly to maintain.
&gt; 
&gt; The local junkyard only has one bus and it is a '77 with a 
&gt; 1.7l BC engine. I did notice a '72 Porshe 914 with the engine 
&gt; still in place ( I couldn't read the engine code). The junkyard 
&gt; dude said that the costs would be US$200 and $400 respectively. 
&gt; I'm not really sure if either of these engines would match-up 
&gt; properly with the existing transmission. 
&gt; 
&gt; I could resume my search, if I knew which engines to look for. 
&gt; 
&gt; Please help me snatch another bus from the jaws of death. 
&gt; 
&gt; With your kind help and guidance another VW bus will 
&gt; live to celebrate its next birthday.
