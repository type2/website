Subject: Fuel Pump Problem?

I'm in a real bind here, so I hope someone can help me out...

My 81 Vanagon keeps dieing unless I keep the accelerator
pressed slightly.  In other words, car is fine when gas
pedal is pressed, but once my foot comes off the pedal,
it dies.  At stoplights I have to keep pumping the gas
to keep it from dieing, and if there's a sudden stop
on the freeway, it's a white knuckle situtation to keep
it from konking out.

It's a 4-speed; 140k miles, I'm the third owner; and
could use a valve job.  I run plain unleaded gas and
20/50 oil.

Any help is *REALLY* appreciated (I've got to get to
a bike race early sunday morning).
