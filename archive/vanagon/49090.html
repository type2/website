Subject: Dying Child -- Pls send cards



My friends six year old boy was just diagnosed with terminal liver
cancer.  Little Jim would love whatever cards you could send in the few
months he has left:

Jim Boshart
388 Greenwich St.
New York, NY 10013

His parents thank you and I thank you.  May your cheer give him a bit more time.
