Subject: Engine Fires

Volks,

My recent experience included an acute awareness of engine fires upon
rear-impact.  Mine didn't start on fire, but with the spare battery looking
like a cherry filled chocolate someone had put their thumb through, spewing
acid all over the engine, I'm sure one spark would've set it ablaze.  A fire
seems likely to me when a rear-engine car is hit from behind.  I'm putting
my fire-extinguisher where I can get it quickly.

Eug,
