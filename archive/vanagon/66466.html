Subject:      Re: Propane regulator question

&gt; I found the propane &quot;leak&quot; and it seems to be coming from a very small
&gt; round hole near the top right corner of the face of my propane regulator.
&gt;  Is this hole supposed to be here and if so what is its function and why
&gt; is gas escaping from it?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Bryan

It's *probably* your regulator's overpressure relief valve.  Most
regulators have a valve designed to vent excessive gas pressure that may
result from a failed regulator valve.  The purpose is to prevent
excessive propane pressures from damaging the gas appliances or causing
propane leaks into the confined spaces, potentially causing fire or
explosion hazards.  This leak IS NOT A NORMAL CONDITION and is EXTREMELY
HAZARDOUS!

The only fix is to replace the regulator assembly.  You don't say what
year your van is or give any information about which model regulator you
have, but in general direct replacement units are not available.  An RV
repair place can probably fit in a substitute model by re-doing the piping
to accommodate the dimensional differences, but I wouldn't recommend this
for the do-it-yourselfer.

You might also want to check out the more savvy supply places, such as
 the Bus Depot (http://www.busdepot_dot_com/).  They may have a cache of these
older, out of production units.
