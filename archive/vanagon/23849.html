(sorry about pressing the send button before typing anything).

Anyway, I just spent $360 on the 84 vanagon for maintenance that I probably 
couldn't have done myself.  But, just the same, I'm kinda interested in a 
Bentley manual for the beast, but not to the tune of $85.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how a Bentley manual (for an 84 Vanagon) 
might be obtained for less than the dealer is asking?  I'll check the 
archives....

Thanks in advance.

(PS - Gerry, thanks for the muffler, now the van doesn't sound like such a 
monster &amp; I'm not embarassed to drive it home anymore.  Hope your tranny 
works out ASAP)
