Subject: Updated Pages: 10 Syncros FS

Folks,

I'd love to tell you that the Syncro Westie pages have gotten an
all new look, but it ain't true. But I have fixed the broken links,
updated it a bit, and dumped all those old ads. 

I did post 6 new ads for Syncro Westies, and 4 ads for Syncros, most
of these have been posted on the Vanagon list recently so they 
may be old news to eagle eyed Syncro Westie trackers.

Go have a look at:
