I have a question about the heat exchangers on a '71 bus.  I don't plan 
on buying them from JCWhitney but I was looking at their catalog last 
night.  They had them for $79 each for the '71 bus through the July 
production dates.  The remainder of the '71s they want $199 each.  I 
know my bus was made in November.  What gives with the price 
difference?  Can I assume that other/better sources for them will have
similar price differences?  If cost is no factor (hahaha) who makes 
the best ones?

PS  I found a garage to use and it is full of tools!  So, 
contributions are now being accepted for the new engine, heater, 
brakes fund.  Also, I posted this to VintageVW and Vanagon, sorry to 
those who receive both.

Thanks, Jim
