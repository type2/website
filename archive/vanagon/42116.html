&gt;I think the trick is to get the right amount of fuel to air pumping going.
&gt;I'd try by turning the gas level (temp knob) down to Min. and hold the
&gt;button in and pump the pump handle several times keep holding the button
&gt;in and the ingnition light flashing. 
My friend and fellow list member Kevin Corcoran ('90 Westy) gave me a 
simple solution: unscrew the little metal plug under the front bottom 
edge of the fridge (has a little chain attaching it to the fridge). I'd 
been pumping and clicking away like a maniac, but after pulling this 
plug, it worked right away. It was amazing. 
I screwed the plug back in and it's fine now.
I guess condensation built up or something inside the lighting chamber.
