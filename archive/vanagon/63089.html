&lt;&lt; I have an 84 Wolfsburg Westfalia GL and I bolt and unbolt the whole
 schebang, which is a bit of work (mostly to lug the seat about).  Last
 night we went to a drive-in theatre (George Of the Jungle and Hercules)
 with the middle seat in (for viewing purposes).  Now I will remove it to
 get back to cleaner seating for 4 (wife, 8 and 4 yr old boys and me)
 install the rail covers and the floor mat.

 But I am intrigued (but scared) about this prospect of not bolting in the
 bench seat.

 Has anyone been doing this?

 Do you feel safe this way?

 Does your spouse/SO feel safe this way?

 Ever been in an accident?  What was the result? &gt;&gt;


Neither of my vans had the middle seat bolted to the track when I got them,
and they are still this way.
And, no, the seat has never slid from one side of the van to the other,
either....
