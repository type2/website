&gt; &gt; 	 As far as I can see from both Haines and Bently, there is no cam
&gt; &gt; difference in the f.i. - carbureted engines. Right?
&gt; 
&gt; I hear the 77-up cam is different than the 72-76 one because of the
&gt; hydraulic lifters.  Don't know for sure, though.
&gt; 
 Ditto, here. I don't think it's a problem, though. European 2 liter buses
 got the hydraulic lifters in '78 and kept the twin solex carbs. 


&gt; &gt;    The big difference I do notice, however, is clutch size. The '81 must
&gt; &gt; have had the 228mm clutch (it does have hydraulic linkage) while the '73
&gt; &gt; has the 210mm. The manual says that the 228mm is for the hydraulic clutch,
&gt; &gt; the 215mm for the cable operated. Question 1: Will the 228 clutch be too
&gt; &gt; stiff for the cable in the '73?   Question 2: Will the 215 clutch fit the
&gt; &gt; 228 flywheel? I have to buy a new disk and pressure plate regardless, just
&gt; &gt; don't know which to go with. 
&gt; 
 '76 and later buses have the 228 mm clutch, should be no problem as regards
 the cable. I'd get the pressure plate and clutch that goes with the flywheel.
 You might call a VW transmission rebuilder just to make sure that the input
 shaft on the transmission in your '73 has the same splines as the later 
 buses. OR, you may want to get an 091 gearbox from a 2 liter bus - They have
 way more ribbing on the case, there may have been some changes to accomodate
 the added torque from the 2 liter engine.
