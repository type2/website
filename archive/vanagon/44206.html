 I think it was used from
&gt; '65-'67 model years.  Any one actually own one of these?

I have a bunch of these. They seem to be worth a fair buck up here. Personally having one of these windshield washer bottles 
installedis about as effective as a squirt gun on your windshield. They literally are pressurized with the rubber &quot;Button&quot;  that you  push 
_by hand _(squirt gun reference again, no pulling up to the air pump to pressurize the water contianer) on the top of the washer fluid 
reservoir. The rubber buttons like to rot out and up until a few years ago were not being reproduced. I seem to recall NOS going for 
like $50.00 just for the rubber button. I am reasonably sure they are being reproduced now but in an incorrect grey colour as opposed 
to the correct &quot;black&quot; colour that they originally came in.

FWIW I have seen people rig up an electric water pump that you can get cheap at a FLAP and run it that way as opposed to the 
manual way. Depends on how much of a purist you are is guess.
