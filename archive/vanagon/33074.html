Subject: synthetic oil + leaks?

welll........
after raising the ire of synthetic devotees (of which i am one at 
heart) i have to report that my crankshaft oil leak is gone after 
switching back to 5-30 dino.  i took a ~240 mile jaunt today with the 
van and it remained dry.

this '87 has 172K miles on it and has had quite a bit of syn run thru 
it but not exclusively.  as i'd said before, i didn't have leaks 
previously with the 5-50 syn so maybe 5-30 syn is just too thin for my 
particular engine.  i've got a bunch of 5-50 syn that i'll try again 
sometime and see if the thang remains dry.
