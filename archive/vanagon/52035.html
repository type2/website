to All:

there have been many words about the poor quality of Dansk pipes.  as Kyle
mentioned, maybe this was a quality control problem that hopefully was
fixed.  anyway, i'd like to relate a positive experience with Dansk.

last year i replaced my exhaust system up to the cat while doing the head
work.  TIP:  if you're going to be removing the heads and have a poor
exhaust system, just cut the pipes off close to the head and THEN remove the
bolts with the head on the bench where you can heat, soak, tap, and pray on
two feet as Darwin intended.

i used a set of Dansk, ordered thru our VW dealer in town.  the quality of
*my* set (YMMV) was excellent with heavier than OEM materials used and 2
extra braces over the factory unit.  using new SS bolts, slathered with
anti-sneeze, they bolted right up.  one leak at the conjucture of the header
banks that was remedied with loosening then tightening.

after about one year of service, they are surface rusted but sound.
