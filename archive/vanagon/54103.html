Subject: Re: Import Westy from Canada

I recently brought a Kombi Syncro from Canada to California.  Here's what
I found out.

First, this is possible -- easier for a Westy since it was sold in the US
as well.

California DMV noticed mine only when going to issue a title in Sacramento.
Their VIN number computer check revealed that this was a Kombi (model 
designator is &quot;X&quot;) and not a US available model.  They then required USEPA
and USDOT approval, a letter from Volkswagen and an inspection.

US Customs might hit you for some import duty.  They passed on me (probably
because the old Kombi just looked like a cheap used van).  Budget for this
possibility -- they can hit you for &quot;general duty&quot; of 10% on a used car --
I carried an extra $300, but then they waved me through.  US Customs is also
supposed to hit you for DOT and EPA compliance, but they passed me through
also -- because I already had California registration completed.  You really
want to get the DOT and EPA clearances before you do this.

You need to ask VWoA for a &quot;Letter of Compliance&quot; which will state that
the vehicle is basically the same as the US model, with some exceptions:

USDOT requires that the vehicle meet US standards.  Fortunately, all Vanagons
are *real* close.  The only thing needed is a speedometer that reads in
mile per hour.  You can either put in a US version, get lucky and find your
Canadian one reads both (mine didn't), modify the speedo, whatever.  They will
require proof of this change.  I simply printed up a paper dial face and 
taped it over the original.  Came out looking great.  The odometer can
stay in Kilometers -- as long as it is clearly labelled (which they are).
The other required difference is the little brake idiot light.  The US
version needs to say &quot;BRAKE&quot; as well as have the icon.  They missed this on
my originally, since VWoA did not put it in their letter.  They caught VW's
ommission, since they have done more than one of these.  California required
a letter from DOT for me.  DOT simply stamped the VW letter as approved for
entry into the US.  You might have to do these changes before you bring in
the vehicle.

California also wanted a USEPA approval.  EPA just accepted the VW letter,
which stated that the Kombi met all US Emissions requirements -- including
California's.  You'll probably get the same if this is an '86 or later,
since they were all the same, basically.  EPA wrote a letter of acceptance
for me.

Then I needed the dreaded California inspection.  I failed to pass smog at
idle initially, but some fiddling, and a new idle stabilizer fixed that.

Altogether this took about six months to get all the paperwork done.  I'll 
try to get all the addresses, phone numbers, etc. for you later if you need
them.  Massachusetts may be more or less tough on this than California.

I had bought the vehicle before I left the US, and had already
gotten a California registration on it (a temporary one for 30 days until
they inspected serial numbers, etc.)  This was probably what got me through
customs without the DOT and EPA paperwork.  Best thing is if the Canadian
owners will drive it to you, and sell it in the US like maybe Niagra Falls.
Then you will miss the inspection at the border, and can get it all inspected
at your leisure.
