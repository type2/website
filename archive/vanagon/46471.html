Subject: Need help with my '87 propane charge valve

Perhaps, I just don't know how use the propane fill valve on the '87 syncro I
just bought.
I've had 10 filling stations attempt to charge my tank to no avail. The
propane just won't
go in. The red re-set button won't move in or out, and I suspect the re-set
button is not re-setting. I've squirted WD40 into the valve to attempt to
free the re-set button I think is frozen. I've spun the re-set with plyers.
Does anyone know how I can get my tank filled? I'd love to avoid buying a new
valve for the $300 the dealer wants.
