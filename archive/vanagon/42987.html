Subject: Re: losing traction/planing

&gt;&gt;ObVW: Has anyone ever done any hydroplaning in a bus?  Somehow I'm
&gt;&gt;glad I've never had that experience.  A bit of purposeful fishtailing
&gt;&gt;on wet pavement certainly, but no hydroplaning.  Knock on wood.
&gt;
&gt;Yup, lots, thanks to heavy trucks pressing the highways down into water 
&gt;filled dips/ruts.  In a bus the first indication is that the steering gets 
&gt;very light, try to resist the temptation to turn the wheel to see what's 
&gt;wrong =:O.  Then the speedo drops to zero, once the left tire has stopped 
&gt;rotating and is just waterskiiing.  If both wheels are waterborne you have 
&gt;no control, sidewinds and transports are deadly.  Let off the gas peddle, 
&gt;the wheels will sink and start to spin again.  Apply more gas and lift them 
&gt;to check out what just happened :). Nasty things happen when you reach the 
&gt;end of a water filled rut with the wheels planing.  The sudden grab of 
&gt;pavement on the stationary tires really yanks on the steering wheel, be 
&gt;ready for it if one side hits dry land before the other. I've planed a '71 
&gt;Wesy often in the above conditions, never a vanagon.  I have planed a 
&gt;vanagon in slushy snow while passing, got sideways in that one. Never
again. Tim

Thats what I like about my syncro,  it is almost impossable to hydroplane.
Although any vehicle will hydroplane given the right conditions. ie bald
tires, large amounts of water, high speeds.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
