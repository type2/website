Subject: Re: fixing old heat exchangers

Hey now,
        This thread got me to thinkin' bout the bad exchangers I pulled
when I put on the Jtubes. Anybody ever taken these babys apart? I read in
Bently (I think) how to take 'em apart. Is this easy or?  How about buying
jtubes, and using the rest of the old heater box parts? In my case, the
boxes were still functional but the pipes were toast-smelled real good when
I turned on the heaters. Actually had a hole clean through one of 'em down
where they clamp to the exaust. So what's the verdict?

Peace,
