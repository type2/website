Subject: The meaning of FU**ENGRUVEN


&gt; As I tried to explain when a co-worker asked &quot;just what does 'Fukengruven'
mean anyway??&quot; 
&gt;
&gt;Oh man, I know what you mean. The folks at the office think I'm totally
outta my tree. Then again these hosers think it's totally normal to work 101
hrs a week on a &quot;deadline&quot; for a program's release. Cee colon (sic)
backslash my arse! They seem totally amazed when the &quot;deadline&quot; slips at the
whim of the bigshots WAY up on the corp ladder. Hmmm... I'm at home having
the nerve to take a day of vacation that they regularly loose each year for
not taking them. Gee, I feel stoopid! ;-)
&gt;-ellis aka VanBondo while at home~! =)
&gt;
&gt;The Budweiser is cold about right now BTW! 8P
