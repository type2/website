Subject: Need A Checklist...

I am ready to &quot;stock&quot; my westy for traveling/light camping.  I was wondering if anyone 
had some electronic &quot;checklists&quot; of things they keep in the van all the time and those 
they &quot;add&quot; prior to taking a trip.  I used to have some of these lists years ago but 
alas...they have gone to the bitbucket.
