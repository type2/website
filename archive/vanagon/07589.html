Subject:       Do I need professional help?

Hello group-
I am soliciting advice.  All opinions welcome, from 'you're #$%&amp;ing 
crazy' to 'welcome brethren'     Here's my situation:

Currently I own an '85 Weekender.  Usual assortment of problems/joys. 
 I will be selling my 850 Norton Commando due to a longing to keep my 
skull intact for my family (2 young kids, fun wife etc.).  I am 
contemplating turning the money from the Norton over into an 
AIRCOOLED mid 70's camper while still retaining the '85 for day-today 
use.  The aircooled would be a long-term fixup project (something to 
tinker with).  

My question is this, and I know it's a very personal one but I'd like 
input... ** Am I getting into a continual nightmare of niggling repairs 
and nickel/diming me to death or are the joys of uniqueness, 
comaraderie (watercoolers don't wave to each other), worth the 
frustrations?**  I am mechanically able but with fairly significant 
time commitments.  Is it crazy to own one of each? Will you folks 
support me? Will you answer my newbie aircooled questions with the patience 
of an understanding parent?  Will Lassie ever come home?  

Thanks for listening.
Dan (am I crazy?) Houg       '85 Weekender and counting...
