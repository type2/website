Subject: [Fwd: Leaking Head?]

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all.  My '84 Westie has been behaving badly.  She has 180k on her
&gt; so I won't complain too much.  My water temp light keeps flashing with
&gt; no apparent pattern. (Sometimes everything is cool and then a
&gt; heart-stopping light and the gage runs to the max). My brother and I
&gt; have flushed out the coolant and refilled, (as well as bled the system
&gt; a few times) to no avail.  I have no fluid in my oil and no white
&gt; smoke out the tail pipe while I'm driving.  I have had a few mechanics
&gt; look into the problem while I frantically drove back across the
&gt; country.  One changed a thermostat and mentioned that I might have an
&gt; air bubble in the cooling system that is causing the problem.  The
&gt; other thought that I had an electrical problem.  I made it another 3k
&gt; miles and she hasn't died yet.  Of course everyone has mentioned that
&gt; I might have a leaking head gasket.
&gt; 
&gt; How do I know that my head is leaking?  Also, what is that sensor
&gt; coming out of my driver's side head.  The wire was torched on the
&gt; exhaust pipe.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA for all help.
&gt; 
&gt; Elizabeth
