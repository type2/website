Subject: Digest-format problems

     
     Lately(since the list split) I've been seeing problems with the digest 
     format of the list.
     
     Today, #1058 came across 4 times. While in the past an occasional file 
     would come with about half of it missing.
     
     Does anyone have a clue why this occurs?
     
     Thx,
     
     PSpragge
