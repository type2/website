Tim Smith writes on V_at_L:
 &gt;If my name and email address has been passed on from V_at_L to a 3rd party
 &gt;I want it removed from any newly created list. The distribution of mailing 
 &gt;lists without express permission of the members is something generally 
 &gt;frowned upon. I trust you will have no problem complying with this removal 
 &gt;request Ron.

And Ron Salmon replies:                  
 &gt;&gt;I would never use list info for unsolicited mailings. Period. My only 
 &gt;&gt;reason for checking it is to verify that people who claim to be 
 &gt;&gt;listmembers, are listmembers.  This is because of the special pricing, and

 &gt;&gt;also for my own protection since I am offering check writing priveleges.
 &gt;&gt;It will be used for no other purpose.

I agree with Ron 100 percent.  I also agree with Tim as well over his
concerns in 3rd party disclosures.  I have over 96,000 names and addresses in
Bus Boys' database as well as another 32,000 in the Old Volks Home database
(compiled '82 thru '94) (some of which I'm sure are duplicates and some of
course to be out of date too) and as I have assured Ken Hooper in an earlier
private reply, the only way these names/addresses get released to anyone is
only with a court order.  Either that or its &quot;Erase CUSFIL00.DAT&quot; in the
appropriate subdirectories of my accounting packages.  But it is convenient
to check the list names when a customer &quot;says&quot; he's a list member, but ONLY
for that.
