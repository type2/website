Subject: Wasserboxer problems!

Not mine (yet), thankfully. 

An offnet friend has an '84 Vanagon with original engine, 155K miles.
He had a &quot;mild&quot; coolant leak, and I had downloaded Dennis' stop leak
instructions which we had planned to go through this weekend.

So of course, yesterday he had a *major* overheating incident, though he
has kept coolant level up. Had a similar incident a few years ago, 
attributed to a stuck thermostat, FWIW. Engine runs, but now has what
he describes as a lot of &quot;valve clatter&quot;. Does this make sense after
overheating, or is it more likely imminent engine failure?

Following a similar thread a bit back, it seems like a used engine
makes the most sense here, and following Dennnis Haynes' advice,
it ought to be a 2.1 with the later coolant system upgrade.

Anybody know of one for sale? Or a mid-Atlantic '86 or later with a good 
engine and other terminal problems which could be a donor vehicle? Other 
opinions or thoughts also welcome.

Please post responses to the list because of my infamous e-mail problem.


Thanks

Tom F.
