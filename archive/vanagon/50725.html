Subject: Vanagon 1990 Radio dead

HELP! This is what my husband wrote for me to ask the list:
&quot;Any thoughts on how to reprogram a '90 VW radio security code, or
otherwise re=activate radio/system that became locked during vehicle
servicing. Entry of designated code number inadvertently exceeded limits&quot;

Actually, he doesn't talk like that all the time - just wanted to be
succint. What happened is this.  The van was in for servicing, the battery
was disconnected, the computer chip in the radio got fried. Radio won't
work.  This is the second time it has happened; last time it cost us $90.00
to get the chip replaced, or whatever.

We tried a weired trick I learned of - put the radio in the freezer for a
few hours; my brother tells me thats what crooks do when they rip of the
Blaunk. radios.  He got the tip from a policeman friend.

Any help would be much appreciated
