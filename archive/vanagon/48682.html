Subject: Re: Normal Temperature?

Ed, I made a custom 70C tstat from an MBZ for my 84 and now my 87 and the
temp on the guage sits slightly above the white zone when fully open _at_70 on a
cold day.I replaced the fan switch w/  the rabbit model and the  low speed
fan now comes on just barely past the center red lite dot, presumably _at_95C.By
allowing my van to run at the cooler temps since new I feel this has
prevented the head/oring problem inherant with the breed.
