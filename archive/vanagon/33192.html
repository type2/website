Subject: Naming your VW (was Re: Updated Web Page )

The only thing I call my bug is Piece of Shit. Unfortunately POS won't not
start, won't die and is paid for.

Our newly acquired '87 Syncro we immediately named Aunt Augusta from &quot;Travels
With My Aunt&quot; by Graham Green.  She's like a sweet, old aunt - square, slow, 
cantankerous, but comfy and safe.  She has another darker side - no hubcabs,
tinted windows, the dark-red/maroon paint job, and is always taking us on
adventures.

&gt;BTW, at the risk of starting another mail slot filling thread on this =
&gt;list, is it just me, or do other VW owners have an instinctive urge to =
&gt;name their VW's, when they have never named any other vehicle of any =
&gt;other manufacturing?  I've owned Chevy's and Toyota's, but never grew so =
&gt;fond of them to give them a name.
