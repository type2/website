Subject: Re: Stripped Drain Plug Hole--How I Corrected(?) It

you don't say what year the bus is with the stripped hole.

my story:

I was driving on I-5 years ago and at the town of Willows stopped to get gas.
While gassing up the bus I noticed this trail of oil leading from the freeway
ramp to under my beloved beast ( a carrot orange 73 poptop with a 77 2 litre
fi engine).  Hmmmmm.......

SO  I check the oil- zilch
look underneath and tthe dain plug had fallen out of the hole.

There is nothing faintly resembling a vw shop, dealership, or foriegn auto
supply house in Willows, particularly open after 10pm.  There are bad
mosquitos in that town.  We tookrefuge in Jerry's restaurant

In the morning in a ALs or whatever (FLAPS)  I found a rubber thingy with a
sccrew in it that when you tighten thee screw it expands.  So I put it in,
added oil, and was on my merry way.

I drove it like that for years, but  I still get worried when i pass that
town on I-5.
