I will keep this short by VanBondo standards...

Progress at last! Dropped off the recently located German Safari frames to
the paint and body guy that I should have taken the bus to. The ETA when
asked was &quot;done in two weeks&quot;. Un-huh OK sure heard that one before.
Privately planning on a month. I will have plenty to do in the mean time. 
The rest of Saturday's work consisted of the installation of the steering
box, front suspension, and reinstallation of all of the freshly
tanked,cleaned, and blown-out brakelines. Replaced all brakeline grommets as
I went. Hit the metal lines with a little clear for however that lasts and
for what it's worth (zilch). Just detailing for the fun of it. Installed the
new brake hoses F&amp;R. Had to do a quick weld on the little plate which holds
the rear most end of the clutch and throttle tube to the rear mount. Boy,
I'm glad that we noticed it before the tranny and eng went in! Dressed out
the backing plates with all of the brake parts and plunked the fronts onto
to the spindles. Fresh KYBs GR-2 shocks up front to reduce the booby shakin'
per &quot;Cherry's&quot; request. I had to think about it for a sec but deffered on
&quot;safety&quot; reasoning. Less shaking more watching the road and not Cherry. ;) 

Plans for Sunday...
Blow out the main shiftrod tube in an attempt to get the remaining sandblast
silica out. (The tube was &quot;plugged&quot; but you know how it goes...) I recieved
the new shift rod nylon badmitten (sp wrong I know) birdie thingies during
the week and slipped them onto the rod on Saturday. Plans are to hook-up the
hockey stick and all of the associated items back to the tranny. Rubber
boots used appropriately.

The zero mile motor will be humped down to the adjacent shop for minor
thermostat set up and installation of the bottom most tin (bottom side of
pushrods). The main goal o' the day is the tranny install and hook up the
rear brakes. Four wheels on the ground is a good thing. 

Plans for later in the week is to plug in the motor and haul it home. We
will see...

I gotta fly if I'm actually going to accomplish any of this.
