&gt;I have a '79 engine but the heater boxes are rotten out.  As far as I can see
&gt;the boxes and muffler are identical to the '72 to '74 systems except for the
&gt;attachment to the manifold.  The '72 to 74 units used a type 4 connection
&gt;with a oval copper washer while the '79 used a flat connection with a
&gt;rectangular port.  The problem is to get the vanagon exhaust flange onto
&gt;the the '72 to '74 heater bax.  The muffler was never the problem.
&gt;Does this guy make the heater baxes of just the mufflers?

as far as i know, only the mufflers and exhaust pipes (like for the water-
cooled vanagons).  however, there ARE some folks who make stainless steel
after-market heater boxes for porsches ... so it might be possible to find
someone who would do it.
