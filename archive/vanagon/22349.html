Subject: miss in cyl #1

Yesterday shifting through the gears, as I started third I noticed an 
intermittant miss.  The bus is a '73, the engine is a 2.0 l with web cam, 
hydraulic lifters, and dual Del orto 45 carbs.  I assumed spark plugs since 
these have 30k on them (still look good), but when I changed them out, all 
had the nice grey deposit except #1, which had a kind of medium brown 
deposit.  After spark plug changeout, the miss was still there in #1.  It 
has done this miss thing before, but has always gone away within a day.

Muir gives a scenario where the engine is driven with a miss, makes the 
other three work hard, oil gets hot and quits lubrication, engine throws 
rod.  I sure don't want that, so I'm in the station wagon today.  

Meanwhile, any ideas?  I have checked that the spark makes it at least to 
the top of the plug.  I think my next move might be to check the carb, since 
it is one barrel per cylinder and if the main got plugged that could cause 
the miss (yes, I do have an inline filter).  Other than maybe the wires 
(just because they are a couple years old), anything else looks like major 
stuff, like valve train.

TIA,
Dean Aukes
Going through minor withdrawl 'cause I didn't drive the bus today......
