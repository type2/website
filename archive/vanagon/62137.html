Subject: dometic question

hi volks-

OK, so last night I get home from work ready to pull the fridge out of the
bus (for the second time) and take it to the Dometic place to get it to run
on propane.  I've been trying to light it for 8 months, and no go.  Decide
to give it one last shot.  Plug it into 110V and let it cool, hook up my
B&amp;D airstation to the condensate drain tube thingy and pump the pump a few
times, click it a few times and VOILA!!!  - I see the glow of the green LED
for the first time.  wait a few minutes, remove airstation, release start
button and it's still glowing.  Tip toe out of garage ready to celebrate...

check LED in five minutes - it's out.  try to restart (about 100X) never
see the green light again.  have been checking the flue cover, and I get it
warm (somethings lit) if I hold in the start button.  

so, my premise is that something is wrong with the &quot;flame detector&quot; and
that it never gets around the auto shut off.  does anyone have any other
ideas?  know how this works?

after meeting the repair guy at the local dometic dealer (3 clicks, yup -
don't work) I'm concerned that they will keep it a few weeks and either
fail or install a bunch of un-needed stuff.  has anyone setup their fridge
to run outside the bus?  hooking up the propane shouldn't be a problem, but
what electrical connection does it need?

sorry to be so long-winded, but this has been a really frustrating problem.


TIA
