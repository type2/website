Subject: correction in directions

In my previous send of today, as usual, I made a mistake.  :)

Once in Johnsondale, I told you all to turn EAST on the forest
service road (also called Lloyd Meadows road, or some such
similar name).  But, as Bradley has reminded me, and as I confirmed
on the map, this is really far more NORTH, than east, so take heed.

Thanks for your patience....
