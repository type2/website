&gt; as usual, my sliding side door thinks it is not part of the bus and

&gt; bracket has pivoted upward.  Does anyone know of a good fix to this 
&gt; problem?

Yeah, my '76 developed this problem recently, too.  =:O  :(
I'll be addressing the problem this winter (Just put the camper in 
storage for the winter, double :(  ), but I, too, would like to hear 
people's thoughts on repairs for this problem.  I know you can get 
replacement metal for the lower door track; rocker panel assemblies are 
also available.

Anybody ordered replacement panels for this job from Whipme?  Other 
sources better?  I'll also need a new big swivel-type hinge for the rear 
of the door, you know, the one that attatches to the roller on the track 
that runs under the rear-most side window.

Lots of work to prep our happy camper for Inuvik next summer!  Glad you 
folks are here for support.
