Subject: 	Re: 87 Vanagon: installing VDO oil pressure and temperature senders [long]

&gt; This past weekend I purchased VDO gauges and senders to monitor the
&gt; oil pressure and temperature on my '87 Vanagon syncro Westfalia.
&gt; ...
&gt; I think that some list members could benefit from what I learned. So
&gt; here's a complete report, starting with the parts list:
&gt; ...
&gt; 2 1/8 npt fitting
&gt; 1 1/8 npt T fitting
&gt; 1 2&quot; nipple w/ npt threads
&gt; 4' 1/8 copper tubing
&gt; roll of teflon pipe tape
&gt; ...

Thanks for the report.

What material were the npt fittings made from?  Copper?
