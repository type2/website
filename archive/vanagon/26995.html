Subject: BEARLYMUVEN

Hey now,

i've got a sticker on my rear window that says BEARLYMUVEN with the umlaut
over the u and a little dancing bear with a vw symbol. get lots of waves and
laffs over that one...

i passed one of those water-leakers at the beach last weekend...they were going
55 and i zoomed by in my '74 bus at 65mph. looked like a bunch of longhaired
freaks. :-)

truckin' on,

jonathan ('74 bus Viola Lee...n0 p0wAr brAk3s!)
