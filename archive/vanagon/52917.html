Dear desperate;
Right of the top of my head I would say re-check your valve adjustment.
Did you use the Bently procedure ? I could be wrong but when I did it
three years ago there was something peculiar about their procedure. It
states to adjust #1 then rotate crank 180 degrees CLOCKWISE and go to
NEXT cylinder. First , what is NEXT cylinder? Second this seems
backwards to what Muir says in the idiot book. If memorey serves me I
rotated COUNTERCLOCKWISE and did #2. Any way, if you got two lifters in
a bind you could have trouble.
Good Luck

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;ANY HELP APPRECIATED!!!
&gt;
&gt;A little history first:
&gt;
&gt;Did a top-end overhaul (head gasket, valve job, rings, rod bearings, 
&gt;etc.) about 4,000 miles ago.  A couple of weeks ago, noticed loss of 
&gt;power; also had heard a dull knocking noise (just a few knocks) when 
&gt;starting.  So......this weekend I:
&gt;
&gt;	changed the fuel filter
&gt;	removed the catalytic converter
&gt;	retorqued the heads
&gt;	readjusted the valves
&gt;
&gt;Now, it won't start!  Tries to turn over, but just sounds like 
&gt;somebody 
&gt;wheezing!
&gt;
&gt;I've checked all the obvious things I could think of (plugs, rotor, 
&gt;what 
&gt;else?).
&gt;
&gt;I BEG FOR HELP!!!!!!!  I REALLY wanted to get more than 4K out of this 
&gt;
&gt;last repair!
&gt;
&gt;Becoming desperate,
