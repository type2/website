&gt; 	Bus folks are Bus folks....we're a minority already let's not 
&gt; divide ourselves.....!!

After all the mess in the media [up here anyways] the last year and
Vanbondo's [or Coyote's...I forget which one] inquiry about the Quebec
situation, we could all take a lesson and not subdivide ourselves
further...  I don't think I can handle another traumatic referendum
in one year...;)

[soap box off]

I have just ones additional question...what happened to the VR6
splitties and the toyota loaves?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; (splits &amp; loaves &amp; bricks)...Oh, my!
