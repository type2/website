Subject: Re: VW motor lifespan ? (A P


&gt;My van has 86,000 on the clock and has 16,000 since the valve drop/rebuild-
&gt;over-christmas-break-gawdawful-expensive episode in 1991.  I would be
&gt;willing to bet that those are original miles, too.  73 campers don't seem
&gt;to run for very long at a time.

Probably right on the mileage bit. You hit the classic valve failure. You 
should revalve (exhaust) the heads every 65,000 miles, or a valve stem will 
break at 70,000, causing money to be distributed wildy to strangers. The 
heat the exhaust valves see causes metallurgical changes in the stem, they 
transform into a more brittle form, then snap. It doesn't matter how well 
you care for them or how well they are running at 65K miles, she can't take 
much more Captain.... If it makes you feel better, our 1971 burned two 
valves and a piston in 1973, at 19,000 miles. That's when we found out that 
Euro delivery VWs had a one year warranty, but two years if bought in 
NordAmerica.  tim s.
