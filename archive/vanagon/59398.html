The '80's did NOT come with the dash blower at all, even in the L 
model nor in the Westi L.  tI wasn't there.  Bentley wiring diagram 
confirms also.  Neither of my '80's have one.
Probably answered already, but not at work last week so late on 
messages.

I will be helping a friend of mine install the dash htr/def. blower assembly
in his '80 Vanagon kombi  ASI Camper.  Obviously since it is a kombi, it
didn't have the blower.
