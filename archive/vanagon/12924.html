Subject:      owner's manuals

... but if there are more 1979 folks out there who want them, i'll order
more and see if we can get them. the ones i got had to come from somewhere,
and there's likely to be more around there somewhere! :)  my point was, that
if someone (me or whoever) orders 5 or 10 1979 Owner's Manuals, it's much
more likely that the order would be filled ... whereas the Parts Guy might
not want to fool with an order of just 1. or maybe the warehouse guy doesn't
care to process an order of a single manual.
