Subject: Re:  Automatic to 4-speed tranny conversion

I had to replace the tranny on my '86 a year ago.  Used trannys cost
&gt;$500 - if you can find one.  The first few places laughed when I told `em
what I wanted.  Recycled Bugs has them, but at around $600.  My father-in-law
ended up finding me one in the bowels of Tennesse and had it shipped to
NC.

I'd say he was yanking rather hard ...

 &gt;There's an '86 Vanagon GL for sale in my area.  I haven't seen it yet
 &gt;but it sounds like what I'm looking for except for one thing -- it's an
 &gt;automatic.  The seller (a used car dealer of VW's, Audi's and Porsche's)
 &gt;said a conversion would probably cost less than $500.  This sounds awfully
 &gt;low to me, is he pulling my leg?
 &gt;
 &gt;Thanks.
 &gt;
 &gt;FWIW, the description is:
 &gt; 89K miles, AC, Body VG, front tires good, he will replace rear tires,
 &gt; 30-day, 1K mile warranty.  asking $3995.
