Subject: Re: Camping at Disney World

Dave Mancuso asks if the in-the park campground at Disney World
(Fort Wilderness) is worth trying.

We've stayed there twice in the '88 Westy.  It is expensive, but
it's incredibly convenient -- you walk up to the dock and take a
little ferry to the Magic Kingdom (tm), or you can catch a shuttle
bus to Epcot or MGM.  The park itself is wooded and more &quot;rustic&quot; than
the usual KOA-type thing, but has the amenities you'd expect from
Disney, including pools and campfire programs.  There's also
a &quot;dinner-show&quot; thing with a Wild West theme -- it's very, very
corny, and expensive.  The waterfront has boats for rent, and
a little beach.

All in all, we'd definitely do it again (but we'll skip the dinner
show...)
