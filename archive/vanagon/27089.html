Subject: Re: speaking of paint





&gt; I'd like to get my bus painted, but in order to cut the costs I want to 
&gt; do at least the prep work myself.  Does anyone have any suggestions on 
&gt; how the prep the car, besides sanding.  I especially am curious about the 
&gt; small areas, such as the rain gutters, under the sliding door mechanism 
&gt; cover, and in the air intake vents.  Thanks.

Erik,


      Do you realise what a big job this is, having just completed the very
  task on my '62 it is not a job i would like to do again (although
  the result is excellent). It took us (me and my dad) nearly 2 Months to prepare
  my bus for spraying, working at weekends. We started of by using a electric sander
  and paint stripper in places to get the paint back to primer, hand blocking is 
  the nasty part, to get all the door jabs, and around the windows back to primer.
  Another option we considered was getting the entire shell shotblasted but this
  was very expensive, this takes it back to bare metal.
