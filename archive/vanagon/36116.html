Subject: Model Bus for Sale

I have a model of  a split window bus that I bought while I was in France.  
I must move and would like to sell it before I leave.  It is still in the 
original box, which is wrapped in Cardboard and holding a plastic display 
case.  It has never been opened.  It is made by Vitesse and is labeled &quot;Bier 
Collection&quot;  and the box is printed to look like beer.  The bus is a green 
and white delivery bus  with &quot;Schwaben Brau......herrlich  frisch.&quot;   The 
box also has Kager  written on the side.  
	I bought it about four years ago with the express purpose of bringing it 
back and selling it at a VW show but just never got around to it.  I don't 
know much about VW models  but I asked the guy in the store to sell me one 
that would be worth something.   I paid about $30 for it.  If you would like 
to buy it,  e-mail me with an idea of how much you would pay for it and 
we'll talk.
Thanks in advance.
