Subject: Re: Tornado Air

yeah,

I've used the Tornado on and off for the past five years.  It does 
quiet the motor down,  I get a very consistant 23 mpg and for what 
its worth I think it has more power relatively speaking as well as 
smooth acceleration.  Who really knows?  I take the thing out and it 
drives fine...I put it back in it drives a little better,  but more 
consistantly better.
