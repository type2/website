Hi Everyone!

I guess I should give a small introduction to myself.  I have owned an 1987
Camper for 7 years.  It has seen the inside of a dealership only twice.
Both reasons were because ECM died and left me stranded and in shock that
such an incredibly engineered item could go down - twice - within a year!
Otherwise, I have done all the maintenance myself and tried not to get
dealers involved. 

I normally put about 60000 km a year on the van.  I do a lot of travelling
all around NA to support my addiction to white water kayaking and other
summer winter activities.  I live in the Toronto region of Ontario
(Newmarket to be specific) and am interested in dealing with other Camper
owners in the area to see where they get their parts and service info. 

I hope to be able to get info and share whatever I can about my van.
