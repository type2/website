Subject: Re: More '62 Kombi window stuff

     Mark,
     
     &gt;If folks with splitwindowvans want to look at their front door window 
     &gt;setup and tell me what the notched strip screws to and how big it is 
     &gt;and what shape, I'd appreciate it.  I want to get this bus on the 
     &gt;ROAD!!!
     
     Well the way I see it if you ain't got anything to screw the strip to 
     then you ain't got much of a door frame ;)
     
     The removable door top comes in two major sections: the top outer 
     frame and a base strip. The base strip sits along the top of the 
     actual door and is just a U-section channel. The Top frame section 
     sits on top of this. The Base u-channel is where the notched strip 
     fits. It kinda looks like this:
     
     
     top section:
