Subject: ohhh no, oil strainer to tight

hello all,
	ohhh boy am i a little worried.  i changed my oil last night
(somewhat in the dark, long story).  anyway, before the oil change i
had a small oil drip, and i believe it could have been coming from the
oil strainer.  anyway, after putting everything back together, with
new gaskets, and filling my 73 camper back with oil the leak is huge,
and definately comming from the oil strainer!  i am hoping (praying,
begging) that it is the gaskets not placed in right, but am afraid i
may have over tightened the nut.  i have a new set of gaskets and am
planning on changing the oil again and all that. 

QUESTION:
what do i look for to see if the bolt has been turned too tight?  and
if it is i will have to pull the engine, correct?  i believe my clutch
could possibley need repair soon so i may as well check and see and do
it all at once.  what else is good to do while the engine is out.  i
was hoping i could put my first engine pull off until next month, but
if it has to be done, it has to be done.  anyway, anyone who knows or
has been through this i would appreciate some advice.  thank you kindly:)


take care,
	brandy
