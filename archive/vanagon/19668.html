Subject: Interior colour of 69 bus

Hi,

I have a '69 UK spec Type 2. My question is regarding the colour (color!) VW 
used to paint the *interior* of the bus.  It is a very lightish grey, but i 
can't see any paint codes anywhere whch refer to this.  The exterior paint is 
Lotus White (code=L282).  Since the bus is immobile at the moment, its a little 
difficult to  take it to the paint factors to get a match.

Can anybody help, or push me in the right direction?

Thanks
