Subject: 84 Vanagon - Parts?

Hi Y'all

I am going to look at an 84 Vanagon this weekend.
The guy is it and I may buy it to get some parts I
need off of it.  Does anyone else need parts and
how much would you like to pay for the part?  I
need to recupe some of  the expense quickly.

I think it may have an AC I will not want.

Please reply to me directly
