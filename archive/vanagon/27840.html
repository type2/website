&gt;&gt;   I thought about putting a tach there, but I've decided that a clock
&gt;&gt;   would provide more useful information - besides, the engine gives an
&gt;&gt;   AUDIBLE report on it's activity on a continuous basis.

&gt;Bah, I always coveted one of these till I finally got one in the '78
&gt;then realized that there was no way I could sleep in the Bus with the
&gt;damn thing ticking.  May just be me though, I got to have quiet, of
&gt;course so does my SO so I took mine out and put it in the parents,
&gt;installed an old radio with a digital clock I had about.  But on the
&gt;other subject, I would sort of like a tach for the hell of it, does
&gt;anyone know of one that will fit the opening nicely?

I have a VDO tacho which fits perfectly in this opening.  When I bought
the tacho about 3 years ago there seem to be two standard sizes, a big 
one and a small one (can't remember the diameters sorry). The bigger one 
is the size that fits, and was about half the price of the small one 
(I think I paid about $80 AUS).  I used a piece of thin ply wood to make 
a bracket to hold it in against the back of the opening. The guage panel 
was built to take VDO guages so it's probably no fluke that it fitted so 
well.
