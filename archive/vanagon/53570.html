Subject: antifreeze smell

Bill Dummitt reported smelling antifreeze with the front heater on.

It's been my experience that whenever I smell it, I find it leaking 
somewhere.  You might want to remove spare and crawl under the front and see 
if you see any evidence of coolant.

I got so use to coolant leaks that I would do a walk around once a month 
sniffing for coolant.
