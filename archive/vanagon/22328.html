Leaving Toronto on our way back to Ottawa today, stopped for gas, up pulls
another Westy. Woman jumps out and proceeds to put gas in propane flue
vent. Quickly instructed her on the correct location for fillup. Turns out
she had borrowed it from a friend. As she was leaving, told her that if for
any reason a  red dash light should come on while driving, she should stop
and call her friend, just to be on the safe side.
