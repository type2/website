Subject: Re: The unexpected trip part 3


&gt;We all had a great evening Friday, and Saturday it was decided that Olga
would be the best source for transportation to the memorial service.
Knowing that the weight limit for a bus isn't all that much, I reluctantly
agreed.  You see, my other sister from Vermont and her two daughters are
rather large of stature (BTW, what is the PC term for obese?). But the six
of us piled into the Westy, and made it to the church on time.
&gt;

Hmmm, how about &quot;gravitationally challenged?&quot;  Or maybe &quot;radius-enhanced?&quot;
