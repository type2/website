Subject: stuck lifter

Greetings

	So I just finished rebuilding my 1600 DP yesterday.  As I was 
adjusting the valves for the first time, I noticed that the exhaust valve 
on no. 4 cyl was sticking.  All it took was a gentle tap with a piece of 
wood to get it to go in.  Figuring this was a problem, I pulled the head, 
squirted more oil into the lifter and proceeded to move it back and forth 
with my finger.  It stuck a little when I pulled it towards me, but moved 
in when I pushed.  OK, that's not too bad.  Put the head back on, 
readjusted the valves.  It's still sticking.  After banging it back in on 
the rocker arm, I began turning the engine back and forth very gently 
getting the valve to move.  It only sticks when the lifter has been 
pushed all the way out by the cam.  Before maximum throw, the valve 
spring easily moves the lifter in and out.
	So I figure, this isn't too bad.  I'll start the engine, it will get 
moved so quickly, it will come loose.  Wrong.  The engine runs quite well 
considering that valve is still stuck open.

	What do I do?  Do I need to pull the engine and crack the block 
again?  Or can I pull the engine, take off the one head, cylinder, piston 
and rod and get in there with a very fine emery cloth and buff the lifter 
right under its lip where I presume it's sticking?  Agghh!  This is a 
set-back.  Any advice?
