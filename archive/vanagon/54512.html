Subject: Re: Thanks (re: profiting...) 

I am not going to respond to Tim Smith, because it will only keep this 
nonsense going.

I do need to say that in all my Bus/Vanagon dealings, I have NEVER had a 
SINGLE dissatisfied customer. It would seem logical that if anybody were 
unhappy with something they got from me, they would have contacted me, not 
Tim Smith.  I would also like to add that Tim Smith has never dealt with me 
himself.

I hope that Tim Smith will honor his promise to never again make these 
statements to the list.  Please note that either way, I will no longer 
respond to them.  This is not an admission of guilt, but rather an 
unwillingness to let this charade go on any longer.

In closing, I'd like to quote a letter that was posted to the list a few 
days ago, from one of many listmembers who _have_ actually dealt with me.  
Please judge for yourself.

&gt;Just wanted to let everyone know that I have had numerous transactions
&gt;with Mr. Salmon and have been extremely pleased with his honesty.  I have
&gt;purchased numerous parts for my Westy from him and he has been very fair
&gt;in all deals.  Most of the Vans I have seen are in excellent to good shape
&gt;at very resonable prices. I have bought used mechanical parts from Ron and 
&gt;he even exchanges them for me if they do not work.  Find that from anyone 
&gt;else and I will be suprised. I just wanted to let everyone know my 
&gt;experience with Ron.

I'm sorry that this has gone on as long as it has. Believe me, it has not 
been an enjoyable situation.  Please accept my apologies for any part I may 
have had in adding fuel to the fire.
Thanks to all,
Ron Salmon
