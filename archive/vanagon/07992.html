&gt; Snap, almost. I got a 70 bus for the take it easy and a Kawasaki &gt;GPz 550
&gt;for the ohmygosh sessions. Have many others on the list gone for &gt;the
&gt; bus/bike combination? 


I also use Bikes as a endorphyn enhancer they are the cheapest thrill on the
road. VW and Kawis must go together, I just sold my KZ550 cafe bike a few
months ago. I am presently working on a single cylinder curve straightner to
take its place though and expect to be on the road by spring (said the same
thing last december).
