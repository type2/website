Dave,
	I am in grad school and as such may have some academic duties 
before June '95 however I could probably take a weekend or four days 
during April or May.  I would prefer sometime after June however.
	After scanning the distibution of people on the list it appears 
that part of the route would probably follow the I-5 north from 
california into Oregon and Washington.  There are four people on the list 
from Oregon and nine in Washington.  About 80% of the people in Oregon 
and Washington live near the I-5 corridor (Eugene, Corvallis, 
and Portland in Oregon and Vancover, Olympia, Tacoma and Seattle in 
Washington).  It appears there are some people on the list from other 
western states: (ID(1), MT(1), CO(2), AZ(2)).  Also, there are some 
others from the northern part of the midwest: ND(1), MN(3), IL(1), MI(3), 
NB(2), WI(4), IA(2).  Based on this the trip could go from 
CA, to OR, WA, BC (Canada), ID, MT, ND, MN, IL, MI, WI, IA etc..
        Also, I would suggest that the participants from each state of 
the trip help to plan the routes in their state.  This would make for a 
much more scenic and enjoyable trek.  For instance, the quickest way to 
get from California to Washington is to take I-5.  However if you did not 
make a 100-200 mile detour to see the great rugged beauty of the Oregon 
coast you would be missing out.  Some of the other detours could be the 
redwood forest in northern California, the North 
Cascade Highway(goes east north of Seattle closed in winter), and Glacier
National Park in Montana.  Also I noticed there are two people in 
Victoria, B.C., you can take a ferry through the San Juan 
Islands (extremely beautiful) from North of Seattle to Victoria
(Vancover Island).  I think there is a ferry from Victoria to Vancover,
B.C. as well.  
	If I participated I would probably join the caravan in Seattle 
and go from there.  I could probably only go for a week or so which would 
mean I could probably get as far east as MT or ND.
	You can put me on the mail alias.
