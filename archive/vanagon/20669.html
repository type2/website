Subject: a/c dealer for buses

I can't remember who asked, so here it is list.....

There is a place called Cooler Air in Rockwall, Texas (just east of Dallas) 
run by a guy named Jerry West.  I've been told that he does a lot of vw bug 
and bus a/c units - installed as well as parts.  I understand that he also 
uses the sanyo compressors, which take only about 1 horsepower instead of 
the 7-8 hp of the old vw units.  His phone is 214-771-3791.
