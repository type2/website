     There is a NADA Blue Book that covers older (pre 1988) cars, check
     your union or bank. I do not know how far back it covers, but I'll bet
     it runs for ten years, i.e., should cover your 78.

     There is also a book for even older cars, but I can't remember
     the name, its called something like &quot;Old Car Price Guide. I found out
     about it when I had an early 60's car that I wanted to insure for
     &quot;declared value&quot;, which are the words that you use with your insurance
     agent.

     The found an insurance company that would do it, but they wanted an
     independent appraisal. So off I went to their appraiser of
     choice, and he looks at the car, and noted its condition was
     average, and we go back in his office. He pulls out this book,
     and finds 1963 356 Super Coupe, average condition, $10K, or whatever
     it was. So basically, I had to pay $50 to have this guy look it
     up in the book!

Has anyone out there ever seen a real &quot;bluebook&quot; for older buses?  From an
insurance point of view, I was quoted $150 a year for coverage when I asked
about a '78 bus, IN DC, &amp; I'M IN MY 20's.  I was told that personal property
tax would be $25.  This is great for now, but what happens when some fool
hits me? (After all, DC can be pretty crazy)  Do I get a check from the
insurance company for $50 because that's all it is worth?  I know an
appraiser can give a value for an individual vehicle, but I was wondering if
indeed there are older bluebook values with fair, good, excellent
conditions, etc.  I seldom see buses for sale here in Wash DC and they vary
so much that is almost impossible to compare.  I am going nuts trying to get
one (even though I've never even stuck my head in one).  If I had a baseline
&quot;value&quot;, I could add or subtract extra costs necessary to get it in the
condition I want.  Again, any advise is appreciated.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!
