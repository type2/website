&lt;&lt; &gt; Still planning our trip from New Mexico to California and I'm wondering
 &gt; what opinions ya'll may have on auto clubs like AAA?   
 
 I happen to like AAA Plus.  I think it's near $70 a year now with the 
 Plus option.  100-mile towing, locksmith services, a couple of  &gt;&gt;


Actually, it's cheaper than that - like 56 or 60 bucks per year for the
AAAplus.

You wouldnt believe the stuff they've towed for me no questions asked!!!
totally illegal cars...(ie. junk parts cars) ...a '75 westy w/ a 10 yr
expired inspection w/ no rocker panels (they even pulled it outta the weeds
for me!!) and then when one of the dryrotted tires blew up on the freeway he
even changed it for me!!  (man.. you shoulda seen people get outta the way
right quick when that 'ol westy started fish tailing and throwin' chunks of
tread all over the place  :&lt;).....I slipped him a couple extra bucks for the
hassle.. :&lt;)  ...a '65 bug w/ NO floors....and the engine sitting INSIDE the
bug on a couple of 2x4's laid across the tunnel and what was left of the
heater channels..  yep you name it , they've towed it...  

Best 60 or so bucks I've spent in a while...  :&lt;)
