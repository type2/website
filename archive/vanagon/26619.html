Subject: Faucet Questions

Hello fellow Vanagon enthusiasts!

If anyone has suggestions on the situation described below, please e-mail me
directly at ewilcox_at_aol_dot_com, because I'm not currently subscribed to the
group - Thank you.

I have a 1990 Westy and the faucet system has had problems (i.e. it does not
currently work).  The dealer has fixed it (only temporarily) twice, but
claims the problem is in the faucet assembly itself rather than the pump.
 They said that the price of one of these things is around $250!!  I have
tried to take the thing apart and connected the two wires, just to see if the
pump turns on.  This used to work, now it doesn't.

Has anyone experienced these same symptoms?  Are there any clean alternatives
to a $250 replacement of the facet assembly?  How else should I test the
system as a whole before changing anything?  Please advise!
