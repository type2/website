About a gallon of water is produced for every gallon of gasoline burnt.
All signs of it should vaporize though, after the engine reaches
operating temperature.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday I noticed an unusual amount of water being spit out from my
&gt;exhaust.  I was a good 10 feet away from the exaust and could see rain
&gt;drop sized drops spewing forth...
&gt;
&gt;How much (if any) water is normal in exhaust?  What horrific disease
&gt;could my baby have??
&gt;
&gt;anxiously awaiting...
