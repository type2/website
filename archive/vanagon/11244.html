Matt,
I had exactly the same symptoms on my '71 squareback a few years ago. It turned 
out to be a poor electrical contact on one of the fuel injectors. These babies 
require a solid, low resistance contact. If I remember right, the resistance 
value of the injector itself is only 2-3 ohms. I went nuts trying to figure out 
under what conditions the problem would occur. Seemed like it was usually on the
freeway after the motor was warmed up, but not always. It scared the crap out of
me a couple of times in the fast lane.

One injector had all kinds of oxidation on it, no doubt from water leaking in 
through a cracked connector bootie. Cleaned it up...mystery solved.

Hope your problem's this easy.

Erik

&gt; Ok, a few things.
&gt; Thom should be able to charge his 12 Volt deep cycle by
&gt; making a voltage doulber, right?
&gt; I've heard they are pretty ineffecient, but oh well.
&gt; 
&gt; The second thing has something to with my fuel injection.
&gt;  
&gt; Ittermittetly, it misses a beat, and like 'stops', but
&gt; then will go again.  lately the stops have been lasting more
&gt; than the goes.
&gt; 
&gt; Some have suggested that this is the wiring to the double relay or
&gt; perhaps the air flow sensor?
&gt; 
&gt; I have had someone wiggle all the wires they can reach while I was
&gt; drivine to try and pin point what was going on, but they couldn't
&gt; get it to do it.  Then it started doing it right after putting the
&gt; hatch back on.  
&gt; 
&gt; It also seems only to do it under acceleration, and seems to go away
&gt; under full/high throttle positions, and also after the bus has been
&gt; running for some time.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps its the ignition coil? Rotor/cap?
&gt; 
&gt; It really has me tyotally perplexed.  I am planning on going through
&gt; the wiring harness and try and find any cracked wires/connectors,
&gt; 
&gt; perhaps replace the coil? (how can I check the coil?)
&gt; and rotor/cap (for sure, it needs it anyway)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any hints at all for this?  I would like to have it running
&gt; reliabley by this weekend so that we can take it to a hockey game so
&gt; that I can take this extremely attractive young woman etc etc :)
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any ideas they could mail me, I would be very happy.
&gt; Alternately, if anyone has any suggestions for improving my spelling,
&gt; I would appreciate that as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Ta Ta
