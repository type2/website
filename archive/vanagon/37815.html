&gt; &gt;&gt;and the new one is
&gt; &gt;&gt;NFA 4295  (a &quot;stealth&quot; hippie plate so as to avoid a bit of hassle)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In any list this size, no matter how intelligent and/or perceptive the
&gt; &gt;normal
&gt; &gt;clientele is, there's always someone who just doesn't get it.
&gt; &gt;In this case, I qualify without reservation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, what does NFA 4295 stand for?   &lt;hanging head in shame&gt;
&gt;
&gt;         Wait wait! I know I know!! &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, April 2 1995. NFA is
&gt; the song, 4/2/95 is the date the Grateful Dead performed it.
&gt;
Close indeed. The NFA is the song &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, as performed originally by
Buddy Holly. The 4295 however might be better written as '42-'95, or a memorial
to the dates that Mr. Garcia graced us with his inspirational presence...
