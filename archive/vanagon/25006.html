Subject: FS:  1988 Westfalia

I was on my way to West Saint Paul to take my wife to a crafts show when I
came across this one in the Sam's parking lot in Inver Grove Heights.  This
is the only time that I've seen the owner/seller with it to sell in a parking
lot!  Anyway, it is a 1988 Westfalia GL, 77,000 miles, 4 spd, A/C, cruise
control, power windows, locks, brakes and steering.  It is maroon metallic
with grey interior.  It also has a roll out awning that he said he paid $900.
 The price is $13,000.  His name is Jim Wandler and the number is
612-457-1419.


Usual disclaimers.
