On the recent thread about changing transmission fluid...

... someone mention that you should do it 600 miles after a rebuild.

So tonight I went out and did it.  About 3100 miles too late, but...

Anyway, the drain plugs were absolutely hairy with metal shavings!  Scary!
I put in 140 wt fluid, in hopes that it would slow down theleaking thru
the shift bushing and quite the tranny down, and maybe smooth up the
shifting.  Seemed to work.  I also tightened down the shift lever in the
cab.  That may also have had something to do with the sloppy shifting...

Did I irreparably harm the tranny by not changing it sooner?  When I 
bought it, nobody mentioned and interval for the first change... I'd
planned to do it, honest, I just never got 'round to it...
