&gt;
&gt;        Thank you for inputting your convictions about vanagons.  I have
&gt;long held a frustration for the apparent contradiction between what I
&gt;beheld as a truly world class vehicle, &quot;truck of the year&quot; in 1980, and
&gt;have seen em in news, and movie footage the world over vs. the sour and
&gt;dour reputation by the uninformed.  At first glance a vanagon is all charm
&gt;to me.  I feel as a newcomer to the scene, I have been actively searching
&gt;and learning for several years, with a desire to get a good one, that the
&gt;cooling system's, lets say &quot;uniqueness&quot;, coupled with the number of
&gt;obstacles in the wasserboxer and for the usual hatred most owners have
&gt;with &quot;dealerships&quot; I grew up in a family with a bodyman dad and a stepdad
&gt;mechanic, and know my share of dealer stories, which create this negative
&gt;reputation.
&gt;
&gt;        Number one question I have now is, does a correlation exist
&gt;between: volume of coolant, surface area of coolant system, and factors
&gt;such as depletion of effectivness in the actual coolant.  For example. Do
&gt;rubber or metal pipes carry the fluid to and from the motor. Does this
&gt;&quot;volume of liquid&quot; 9 gallons I think, offer any disadvantages.  Its seems
&gt;that to remove air from such a system that has been &quot;evacuated&quot; would take
&gt;some time. Lastly the sealing areas. One potential for air to reenter the
&gt;system on cooldown, and especially &quot;unique jug, case and head&quot;
&gt;arrangement. I don't if the heads have coolant passages in them.
&gt;
&gt;        Anyway, my number 2 prioity, fire extinguisher is #1, is to get my
&gt;coolant situation assesed and corrected if possible. I have been reading
&gt;yours and others comments in the archives.  My motor has 15k on it and is
&gt;a VW factory rebuild. Do those rebuilds get &quot;inspected&quot; and replace as
&gt;needed or are there a set of new parts. Are these motors as good as the
&gt;implecation of &quot;factory rebuild&quot; implies? Stuff like that is of intrest,
&gt;if you could point to the right area to research I like it. The vehicle
&gt;has been well cared for mechanically and I'm happy about our prospective
&gt;future.  Thanks again. MK 91 Carat
&gt;
&gt;&gt;the problem is, with all cars, not so much your choice of MODEL, but the
&gt;&gt;choice of the individual car. :( i got burned on a Porsche and a Mercedes
&gt;&gt;in years past ... i picked the right model (for me), but jumped on the
&gt;&gt;wrong individual car (a piece of shit in both cases). well, i'm older and
&gt;&gt;hopefully wiser now, but my point is that experience (or a friend who has
&gt;&gt;it) is the only cure. :(
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;vanagons are NOT pieces of shit, as a model or group. they DO require some
&gt;&gt;other-cars-don't-have-to-do-this maintenance. but actually, i know a fellow
&gt;&gt;who had a toyota truck, renowned for their reliability, do the same thing
&gt;&gt;with the head gaskets ... because he drove too many miles without changing
&gt;&gt;his coolant (the truck also had an aluminum head). so it's not just vanagons
&gt;&gt;... although that's all you'll hear about on this list. :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;the trick to finding a good one is look, look, learn, look, and look some
&gt;&gt;more. if it seems too good to be true, it is. period. i'm looking for
&gt;&gt;another one, and all the ones i've looked at have the head gasket leaks. :(
&gt;&gt;(which is evident by either drips under the car, or drive it around a while
&gt;&gt;and see a big bubble in the leftmost coolant tank). and i don't even trust
&gt;&gt;ANY of the dealers!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;so if you want a good one, it just takes a lot of time and looking. but the
&gt;&gt;same is true of a porsche or mercedes ... well, cept there are probably a
&gt;&gt;lot more of them out there. :)   good luck!
