A happy ending to the search for a solution to my '87 syncro westy fuel =
injection woes:  After a few more unsuccessful attempts, the dealer =
finally tried enhancing the grounding of the right side of the engine.  =
He installed a new grounding harness and the chronic missing, loading up =
problem went away.  He indicated that poor grounding might also be why =
the idle relay had failed.  I picked the car up last Thursday and it ran =
flawlessly for the 50 mile trip home.  We then had 14&quot; of snow over the =
next 2 days and I had a ball cruising around in my tank of a van over =
the weekend.  It's running great.  Again, thanks to everyone who made =
suggestions.  The vanagon list is a great community.
Happy holidays!
