Subject: Re: CB Antennas and stuff

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks Cetin.  How about if one could arrange a loop or antennae
&gt;&gt;INSIDE the van.  Maybe like in the headliner and edges of the front
&gt;&gt;windshield and down into the nose?
&gt;&gt;

If all CB antena on all cars are mounted horizontally then CB antena can be
mounted on the popup top along the edge. But while everyone's is vertical
it probably won't work well. I guess antenas are meant to be vertical for
nondirectional broadcasting and receiving reason... Does anyone mount CB
antena horizontally?
