Subject: Re: vanagon rims --&gt; 6x15 inch!!

&gt;I saw a Vanagon yesterday at the Eureka Springs, AR show that was using
&gt;alloys off of an Audi Quantum.  The owner had to machine out the center
&gt;hole a little bit, but they looked pretty neat!  8-)  Looked like stock
&gt;lugs were used.

If you're willing/able to do the machining, try the dealer for steel rims,
in size 6x15  part# 447601025A.  I had a set home for checking, fit fine,
offset OK for 1/2&quot; wider rim, looked/fitted great, except for the centre
hole.  Dealer wouldn't deal enough to make it worth my while, wanted $110Cdn
each, new.  Wanted them for bigger sneakers on the Syncro. May be worth
trying on 2WD vanagons/loafs. Will do once the crewcab arrives.
