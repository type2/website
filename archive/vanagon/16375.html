Subject: Kadron DP manifolds FS


I recently bought a pair of (used) Kadron carbs for 1500-1600 upright
engines. They came with two sets (yes, four manifolds) of manifolds for
dual-port heads.

Anyone needing a pair of dual-port manifolds for your Kadrons, now's
your chance. :)  $25 plus shipping gets one pair. No, I'm keeping the
other pair.

Or, if you currently have a pair of _single-port_ manifolds for these
carburetors, I'll trade you straight across, and we'll each pay our own
shipping between your area and mine (San Diego).

Any takers?
