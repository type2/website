Subject: Second Notice: New Bus Group

If you want to be on the list and have not yet responded, send your email
address to me:

           A76VWBUS_at_AOL.COM

The List is for owners and mechanics specifically for 68-84 buses campers
etc.  It is a forum for tech help, classifieds (hopefully) and other answers
to those frustrating questions us Bus owners encounter (this is what it does,
can anyone help me?).  My main goal is to gather info for pancake engine
owners.  Thanks.



                 Drive, Love, and let you Bus make you Happy !!
