Subject: Vanagon airconditioning hoses


Just a tip (OK a story) to share about vanagon A/C hoses.

A few years ago I had problems keeping A/C refrigerant in my 84 Vanagon.
Checked all the connections over and over, and found no problem.  Borrowed
an electronic leak detector, and found nothing around the connections.
Laying under the van, I started to study the long rubber hoses that stretch
from engine to condensor (way up front).  Hoses were kind of oily (slick).
Lo and behold, the electronic leak detector beeps along the entire length
of the hoses!  Apparently the hoses had deteriorated with age, and R12 was
just oozing through the hoses, taking trace amounts of oil with it.

Dealer wanted space shuttle prices for hoses (they're really long).  None
of the FLAPS could order them either - the compressor connections used on
the vanagon are rare.  My solution:  Found a place that carries A/C hose in
bulk (made by Goodyear).  I bought about 30 feet, and got some special
clamps.  The clamps look like regular hose clamps, but they're a bit
sturdier and have a small metal hook tack-welded to the band.  The hook is
used to make sure the clamps are installed at exactly the right position on
the hose end.  I went home and cut off the OEM crimp clamps (they cut off
very easily with a hacksaw, but be careful not to damage the metal
connector pipe underneath the hose.)

The Goodyear hose has thicker walls than OEM hoses, but the inside
diameters are a teeny bit smaller.  I had to work hard pushing the old
metal connectors into the new hose.  But once I finished, I was really
pleased.  Kept A/C in the car for about two years...

I've lost the charge again, but this is due to the compressor connectors
coming loose.  I haven't figured out a way to keep those connections tight.
Over time, engine vibration and motion seems to loose the connections.
Then the O-rings get beat up, and the gas escapes.  With today's R12
prices, I'll probably just go without.  So I've got nice hoses with no
freon ... sigh.
