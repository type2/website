&gt;aha! Thom still reigns! :)  &quot;technically&quot;, Dave hasn't really taken
&gt;possession of 'his' buses yet ... a small but legally techical point. ;)
&gt;but i'll go ahead and add both of them to the list ... only problem is,
&gt;the 54 is gonna have to show up as a 56 (due, of course, to programming
&gt;problems). ;)

&gt;joel
&gt;who's not gonna modify the program until you guys (and gals) get 3 more
&gt;older buses. :P
&gt;

Maybe we can get Willie Lotterman on this list.  Willie, for those of you
who don't know, owns the 2 oldest type II's in existence.

Last night, Dean Anderson from Bus Farmers here in Sacramento came by
my house to look at my bus, and mentioned that it was one of the better
sunroof installations that hehas seen.
