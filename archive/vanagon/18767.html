So Jim boldly-bussing-where-no-one-has-bused-before Kirk says:
&gt; Blushie never missed a lick. The timing drifts
&gt; on her so every morning before we took off, I would readjust it.
&gt; It would drift 3 or 4 degrees retarded. Any ideas? 

Probably needs new points (Unless your doing electronic ignition).
Maybe the distributor springs are tired?  Loose vacuum hoses?

We hit several
&gt; music stores along the way. I bought a strange little Romanian
&gt; mandolin from a man in Charleston SC. He gave me a 1980 Vanagon
&gt; as a bonus. It' has no engine and has been sitting for 4 years.
&gt; The tires are flat, but look to be in good shape. Ideas on the
&gt; cheapest way to transport a transporter back to Indy from the
&gt; south? 

Gave you a vanagon?  Just like that?  Why doesn't that happen
to me? :(  Get some cheap used tires/tyres on the vanagon and
have a friend tow it home with a tow bar.

&gt; everyone to know we were home safe and sound. The kitties are home
&gt; now and are busy destroying the place. My bus is fine. Kate and I
&gt; are still a little tired, but overall OK. Talk to you soon!

Sounds like you had a great time.  Lot's of brew pubs!  You can
be my tour guide anytime! ;)  

(Disco blues bar, that's hiarious) :D

Cheers!
