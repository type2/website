&gt;Anyway, the world according to Joel, is divided into people who consider
&gt;their vehicles &quot;appliances&quot; (that would be the minivan crowd), and those
&gt;who consider their rides something on a higher plane (that would be us).

I confess my shame at such an inappropriate name for my wonderful flat-four
beast. What's even worse is that the name came from people's tendency to
compare my '87 white Westy to a giant refrigerator!

I've been unable to come up with a really good name like my Westy deserves.
Possibilities included Calypso (for Ulysses' ship, not Jacques Cousteau's)
and others, but none seemed really inspired.

I know that naming a VW is a personal matter, but My Type II has benefited
so much from this list that I wonder if you'll all help me name him! This
description may help (he does seem to be more male that female, but I'll
certainly consider names of the feminine variety):

This Westy an '87 has a gorgeous all white exterior, with a strikingly
attractive grey interior. He's somehow avoided the bashed rear bumper
syndrome that previous owners often leave buses with.  He's always well
behaved, with smooth Vanagon handling and famed Type II highway driving
feel. His sticky shifting into first is more than compensated by the can do
attitude (and heat) he shows on cold winter mornings. He seems to appreciate
the nose bra up front for bug protection, and seems to approve of the smiley
face hanging from the mirror. He camps well, and I doubt if he minds late
night magnesium incendiary experiments. He currently enjoys several kinds of
music including Counting Crows (or maybe that's just his owner). He's never
been in any shows, but a mechanic once said that the van had &quot;the driest
heads I've ever seen!&quot; (that is a compliment, right?).

Soooooo, any help you can give my name challenged van (or his creatively
challenged owner) would be appreciated.
