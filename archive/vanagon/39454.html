Subject: No start solution

Well, I took the easy way out and solved the periodic no start problem by
swapping in a rebuilt starter, $70. Self esteem and confidence is soaring now
that I no longer have to plan trips only to &quot;friendly&quot; places about town in
order to anicipate temporary abandonment.

Being a Vanagon of several PO's, it naturally wasn't without surprise. First
bolt came out easy as you please. The hidden bolt was a different story.
Lying on my back with the trans in my embrace and feeling for the second
bolt, I realize the same 14m socket isn't going to fit. &quot;Why would the
chermans do that?&quot; In fact, it takes a 19m wrench since a socket no longer
has room to fit between the starter and the larger bolt head. !/4 turn, flip
the wrench and repeat til done or thoroughly phissed or both.

I assume that some PO had managed to strip the threads and opted for a larger
bolt rather than an insert. That necessitated opening the hole on the flange
a bit and filing down a bump on the case that interfered with the larger bolt
head. I managed to duplicate the sins of the PO perfectly and now all works
well.

BTW, although I refer to a PO, I'm of the opinion that Vanagons in general
are new enough that a lot of the shoddy work that is attributed to PO's is in
fact the product of half-assed or cheating &quot;professionals&quot; that have been
paid for their work. Vanagons are in a different class (stepchild) and pros,
never mind VW, just hate 'em. I believe they do whatever is necessary to get
the things out of their shop, particuarly if the work is hidden from sight. 

My apologies in advance if this runs counter to anyones notion of the
&quot;profession&quot;.
