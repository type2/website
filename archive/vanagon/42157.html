&gt;&gt;&gt;Does anyone here know about an Isuszu Trooper relabeled as a Volkswagen?
&gt;&gt;&gt;I passed one of these today on I495 (DC Beltway) and suspect it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;someone with a weird sense of humor.  Looked like the various logos off
&gt;&gt;&gt;of a vanagon.  Had a VW vinyl cover for the spare tire as well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;are you SURE it was a Trooper?? and not maybe an imported VW Ilitis??
&gt;&gt;VW makes a trooper-looking sort of vehicle for the german army.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;if not, then someone does indeed have a very strange sense of humor. :)

The regular VW (Army) Jeep 'Iltis' has a removeable canvas top and 4 canvas
doors w/ plastic windows. Should be easily distinguishable from the Izuzu
Trooper. Had to drive the Iltis for a while, they are underpowered (around
4000 pounds, &lt; 2.0l in-line 4cl gasoline engine), but fun to play with
(especially in summer with doors out and top down) ....
