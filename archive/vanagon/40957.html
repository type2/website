Subject: Re: hmm, is this bad? could it hurt?(lost spark plug)

&gt;hmm, when changing my spark plugs today one fell out of the ratchet and back
&gt;into the spark plug housing. i tried to get it out with pliers but only
&gt;succeeded in pushing it back where i can't even see or feel it. i shrugged and
&gt;put the new plug in, started up the engine and went to work. i'm extremely
&gt;paranoid now. could that spark plug in there do major harm? how do i get it
&gt;out?

        I do believe this is jonathan of retrowestie (and x-rated) fame,
;-) making this an early T4 engine. I did this once while checking out an
'80 Vanagon for a buddy. Took me half an hour to get the little bastard
out. Made the VW expert look a little stupid in front of both buddy and
seller...but saved buddy a wad of cash, as the engine was fried. You should
be able to feel it through the front spark plug hole. I got it out with a
pair of 90 degree angled needle nose pliers and a helluva lot of patience.
The angled needle nose pliers are an excellent addition to any tool box-in
mine they actually take the place of standard needle nose pliers. Akward
sometimes, but I'm poor. Mine are Craftsman/from sears.
        As to effect, probably minor, but there will be some cooling air
deflection, and I doubt that's very good for the long term.

Peace,
