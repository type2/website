Subject:      Questions about a '91

A '91 Westy popped up for sale down the street from me today, and I have
a couple of questions for anyone who knows...

1. There is rust around the vent in the ceiling. Actually, no rust, but
it is discolored. Pre- rust? I've never seen this on one before, has
anyone else?

2. The poptop window zips across the top and there is velcro down the
sides. Is this the usual setup on the newer westies? Mine on my '85
unzips up the left, across, down the right. Is this a replacement?

I made an appointment to take it to be checked, but is there anything in
particular about the '91's that I need to look at? I took it out and
drove it for about 40 miles. The AC works great, all of the power stuff
works perfectly, the body *seems* okay, it tracks fine, and has no
discernible fluid leaks. The engine is filthy. And there are new tires.

TIA,
Joan
