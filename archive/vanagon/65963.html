&gt;     I've covered my Syncro Westy for the last several years with an old
&gt;     parachute.  I'd like to upgrade my cover.  The question is:
&gt;
&gt;     1.  Who makes the best cover?
&gt;
&gt;     2.  Where can I get one?

I'm very happy with the cover I have from Beverly Hills Motoring
Accessories.
