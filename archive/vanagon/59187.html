Subject: Dometic Reefer


A question and an offer:

Question:  when the dometic power source switch is set to DC and the 
engine is off, is current to the fridge cut off when cranking the starter?

Offer:  I have the original manuel for my Dometic, if anyone wanted a 
copy I would be happy to send them a Xerox.  Email me direct if interested.
