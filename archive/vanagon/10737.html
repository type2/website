Subject: New to list: Need help with 77Campmobile

Hi all,
    I have been here for a couple weeks poking around and now I've decided to
ask for some help.  I have a 77' Campmobile.  I bought it last year in
disrepair and have been saving to fix it up.  Some of the parts I have
started looking for.
      1st.  Exhaust-Including heater boxes.   I found a set sitting in a van
outside a hardware store this past fall.  I tracked down the fellow who owned
the vans and he offered them to me for 25 dollars.  I can't express to you
how excited I was because I had been previously quoted $200ea.  When we went
out to get them, they had been stolen along with his full-roof roof rack.  He
was quite bent and so was I.
      Well, now I am stuck with the delema of not wanting to pay 200 each for
them since I have just found them for 25.  I could really use some advise on
the matter.  I was also wondering if they had any sound deadening quality to
them because I am considering the question of whether or not they could be
replaced with straight pipes, and if these pipes would pass CT inspection.
     2nd.  Body.  I really hate body work.  The work this camper needs is
extensive.  practically the bottom two inches has rotten off all the way
around.  I haven't yet found skins... the only door track I have found is in
J.C. Whitney.  I'll admit I haven't started looking too hard but I was
wondering if anyone could lead me into one direction..   Also,  my front
wheel wells are rotting.  There is a sections behind the seat about 7 inches
wide and 4 inches tall.  I believe that it was a slim piece between the
supports.  I am sort of curious about the risk involved with this project.   
    I really want this one to reach the road.  It had been abandoned in 1984
at a garage in Stamford CT. and it runs good!  I also need a lot of little
stuff like ignition an ignition switch, gas cap, rear window, etc.... the
list goes on.  This is my third air cooled VW  but the first one which needs
substantial work.  I have to admit:  I have considered going out and buying a
camper in good shape for about 2k and keeping this one for parts but I really
do not want to

...........Any advise?

Thank you
toby                 77'Westfalia orange w.  orange and green plaid
