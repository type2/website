Subject:      Alternate Manual To Bentley

I ordered all these manuals to see which one has the most Vanagon stuff.

Reportedly, according to a post from one of our members a few months back,
some of these have 70+ pages of detailed repair information on Vanagon. But
Chilton publishes so many of this series, that it is not clear which one is
best, most complete, and most up to date. The previous poster mentioned the
last one, but look at all the others Amazon lists!

When I find out which one has the best repair information, I plan to send
the other ones back to www.amazon_dot_com for credit and keep the one that is
the most beefy for our purposes:

1 copy of &quot;Chilton's Truck and Van Manual, 1988-1992&quot;
