&gt;supplement which is usually a gas heater.  The two main supplement
&gt;heaters used on air-cooled VWs were/are the Stuart-Warner and the
&gt;Espracher.  These heaters are rather expensive to maintain.  Rebuilt
&gt;ones run in the $300 - $500 range.  So keep this in mind if you live
&gt;where it gets mighty cold.

You might want to add that parts are getting scarce for the older 
Eberspachers and that only a few reputable heater mechanics are known to 
the list.
