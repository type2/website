Subject: RE: anti-theft systems


&gt;  I have one of the most ingenious theft deterent ever invented by VW.
&gt; The Covenant Diesel!  (place fan fare here)  No self respecting criminal
&gt; would dare steal a diesel.

Hmmm.

My '66 Mustang Coupevertible was rifled sometime last night. Contents of
glove compartment dumped on the seat, rear seat torn out, little center
hub of the steering wheel popped out, but radio still in place. Nothing
appears to be missing except the registration stickers, which I had
just gotten and hadn't had time to put on yet.

And... the '80 V6anagon, sitting four parking spaces away with a dead
clutch but visually whole, wasn't touched. I think.

Woulda served them right if they'd tried it. It won't go into gear to
save its life, or theirs which would be fine with me. Maybe it just
*looked* mean?
