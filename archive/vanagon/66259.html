Subject:      Re: power wind. won't go up

thanks for the info
the unit came off a 91 carat so i assume its a later version
the window will go up and down the first three inches just fine
once it gets about half way it won't go up

do you know if carats came standard with power locks + windows?
i have an 89 carat with power locks but not the windows
i'm thinking that the previous owner who lived in a snowy area had
the power window removed because they don't work well all iced up

tyler -philly
88 westy
89 wolfsburg
89 carat
