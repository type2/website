[some stuff about a trip to the library and sliding doors]

Double door busses were available in the early 50's, and the sliding
door was available in 1964.

Its too obvious that there had to be double sliding doors in '64 or so.

At the June Bug O Rama, I saw a breadloaf double sliding door panel...
