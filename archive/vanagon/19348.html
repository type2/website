&gt;   If the Baja trip was to leave, say, San Diego &lt;don't we know someone there?&gt;
&gt;   on Friday AM and return there Sunday evening, would that be enough time
&gt;   &quot;south of the border&quot;? That would be a 3 day weekend for the So. Cal folks,
&gt;   vanagon types from the Bay Area/Arizona/Nuevo Mexico/Alabama and points East
&gt;   would likely need Thurs. and Monday to/from San Diego. 

I'd rather leave San Diego on Thursday in the AM.  One day in Baja would
barely be worth the trip, methinks.  I suppose we could make two groups,
with one leaving San Diego on Thursday morning, and one leaving Friday
morning, and meeting up in Baja.  I would also like to formally offer
my place here in San Diego as an official rest stop on the trip, with
cold drinks, showers, and internet access provided for all (but some may 
have to sleep on the floor!).
