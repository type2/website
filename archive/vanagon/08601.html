lee:

where might those &quot;original&quot; elephant ears be had? Any thoughts on my
question about &quot;VWOA&quot; stamped on the back of the mirrors?


&gt;     michael,
&gt;
&gt;     &gt;I am attempting to use a pair of authentic Volkswagen &quot;elephant ear&quot;
&gt;     &gt;mirrors for my splitty. Does anybody on this list know the
&gt;     &gt;differences between authentic VW mirrors and aftermarket repros? I
&gt;     &gt;was always under the impression that elephant ear mirrors
&gt;     &gt;manufactured by Volkswagen had &quot;VWOA&quot; stamped on the back of them.
&gt;     &gt;Anybody have anything else to add?
&gt;
&gt;     I just fitted some West Coast Metric EE mirros to my splitty last
&gt;     month. They appear just subtly different, ie different screws etc.
&gt;     The difference is that the arms are painted black not chromed like the
&gt;     real ones. I saw a place advertising the real ones CHEAPER than the
&gt;     WCM ones after I bought mine though :-(
&gt;
&gt;     Lee.
