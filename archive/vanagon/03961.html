Hey guys, Bob Dylan DOES have to do with vanagons!  Remember
the song he wrote, &quot;Blowin' in the Wind?&quot;  You may have thought
he intended it as a philosophical commentary, but he was REALLY
talking about the &quot;automatic lange change&quot; feature of vanagons
on the SF Bay Bridge on a windy day.    ;)
