Subject: Re: Running Boards on a Westie Syncro

&gt;1) Has anyone mounted running boards on a Westie before?
&gt;&gt;  Nope, have heard of step/board that fitted into FR/RR jackpoints.

This is true but not for Vanagon body style. I bought one from a bone 
yard,  and it is at a machine shop to be &quot;stretched&quot; a couple of inches.  If 
interested I'll let you know how it comes out.
