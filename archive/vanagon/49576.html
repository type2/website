&gt;Redistribution to the list from which you originally received the
&gt;problem message is kindly requested.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. The email or
&gt;posting you have seen falsely represents Smith Barney and its
&gt;employees. These are erroneous postings that did not originate from
&gt;anyone employed by our firm, and therefore we cannot directly stop
&gt;them from occurring. However we have advised the companies we believe
&gt;to have serviced the originator of these messages and we are pursuing
&gt;all possible steps to end this fraud. Unfortunately some people abuse
&gt;the Internet and we regret any inconvenience they may have caused you.
&gt;
&gt;There are currently no mailing lists maintained in the smb_dot_com domain,
&gt;so you were not subscribed to any list. If you receive any further
&gt;messages of this nature, they are the product of the same spurious
&gt;source.

( insert: a spurious source with the right return address I might note ;&gt;, tjs )


&gt;
&gt;We're sorry for any inconvenience you may have experienced as a result
&gt;of this unfortunate abuse of the 'Net.
&gt;
&gt;Further queries via email to postmaster_at_smb_dot_com please.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
&gt;-James
&gt;postmaster, network security, etc.
