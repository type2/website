Subject: re: Speaking of Windshield Wipers...

The tool you are referring to is a round piece of plastic about 1 1/2&quot; in
diameter about 5&quot; long. Along the side at one end is a cut about half way
through the piece. The idea is to slide the arm into this slot and bend the
arm. The plastic won't mar the paint on the arm. Of course neither will a
rag and a pair of pliers. But that wouldn't look real professional, would
it. The idea is to have the wiper blade run perpendicular to the windshield
so it can wipe in both directions. HTH

&gt;I was just looking over the service bulletins on my new alldata CDrom

&gt;chatter/smearing etc.  Used a special tool to bend the wiper arm a few 
&gt;degress to reduce the problem.  You might want to go to the dealer and have 
&gt;them bend your arms ( i mean wiper) to reduce the problem.

&gt;Mine SUCK!  (Pardon my French, Phillippe)
&gt;
&gt;I'm real dissappointed in the windshield wipers in both my 87 and 88
&gt;Vanagons.  They seem to smear, or chatter or both and just do a poor job in
&gt;general. 
&gt;I've swithced wipers by replacing the assembly sometimes and replacing just
&gt;the rubber insert at other times.  I've tried Anco, Trico (sp?) and right 
&gt;now
&gt;I've got fancy &quot;Tripledge&quot; wipers installed that have multiple ridges on 
&gt;each
&gt;wiper - supposed to be made of silicon for ultimate wiping.  They're just 
&gt;as
&gt;bad as the rest.  They do have a lifetime replacement warranty though.  
&gt;Just
&gt;send in the wiper and about $8 for S+H and they'll send you a new $10 
&gt;wiper!!
&gt;Some warranty!
&gt;
&gt;I've checked to see that the wiper sits square against the glass, it does.  
&gt;I
&gt;also theorized that the wiper wasn't pressing against the glass hard enough,
&gt;so I removed the arm and shortened up the spring attachment clip to get a
&gt;little more spring tension.  This did not help.
&gt;
&gt;No, I'm not just overly wiper-sensitive, I've driven in plenty of cars 
&gt;where
&gt;I rate the wipers as just fine, but not my Vanagons'.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions?
&gt;
