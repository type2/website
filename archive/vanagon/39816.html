So David Schwarze says:
&gt; hot weather, so I called it quits, grabbed a slice of pizza at the
&gt; student union and headed back to the camper.  I should mention that the
&gt; University of Arizona looks like a GREAT school!  Beautiful campus,
&gt; friendly people, lots of computer labs, plus a bowling alley, video
&gt; games, football stadium... tons of distractions for students.  :)  Put
&gt; San Diego State University to shame, I have to say.  Sure wish I could
&gt; have attended here.

Yeah right...  I'm sure the San Diego students all stand around and say,
&quot;Oh gee, what am I going to do now.  All I have is this gorgeous coast
line with lots of frolicking babes (studs? for you women).&quot;  &quot;What-to-do?
What-to-do?&quot; &quot;Oh, whoa is me.  I shoulda gone to lively Tuscon.&quot;  ;p  ;) 


Yee-Ha???????

Oh.... brother....
