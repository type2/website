Good questions, but what is the URL for white lips?

I never saw any white ones.

Also, I gather this means the Winker lips are different from the factory lips?

&gt;Helmut, ok, so tell me if i have this right -
&gt;a set of 4 plastic/rubber (not the Guidoish lookin chrome ones..  :&lt;) Vanagon
&gt;fender lips will cost $335 (US) total including shipping from Germany, and we
&gt;need to send the checks to Martha Rubin, right? When do the checks have to be
&gt;to Martha?? How long for the fender lips to be shipped to the US??
&gt;
&gt;I'm assuming these are the white colored ones pictured on Coyotes vanagon_dot_com
&gt;site..right??
&gt;
&gt;So, in assuming this, they are NOT the 2 piece (factory style) ones that are
&gt;pictured on that yellow syncro on Coyote's site also??......
&gt;(the factory ones appear to be fastened to the bottom edge of the door at
&gt;front, and to the body at rear, while the &quot;Winkler&quot; aftermarket ones just
&gt;screw/adhere to the fender lip on the body..)
&gt;
&gt;and speaking of installation, do they screw to the body (drill holes..yuk..
&gt; :&lt;O) or do they adhere with some sort of adhesive??
&gt;
&gt;AND,... I still would like to know if the body mounted fender lips will
&gt;conflict with the fiberglass rocker trim found on the '88 '91 vanagon
&gt;GL/Carat etc...
&gt;
&gt;Please advise all of us on this before we write checks for $335!!!!
&gt;
&gt;thanks-
&gt;chris
