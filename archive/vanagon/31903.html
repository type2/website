Subject: Vanagon safety statistics

Click and Clack (the Car Talk guys) railed on a woman about the dangers
of driving her '76 Westy (tippy, no side impact protection -- suggested
she wear a footbal helmet).  Anyway, I've heard that the Vanagons are quite
safe.  Does anyone have real stats on this?  Vehicle deaths per mile?
Or Insurance company type of data?
