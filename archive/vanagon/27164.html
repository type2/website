I just called about this one.  The guy I talked to, Nick, was VW clueless,
but working for Nissan-Volvo it was not surprising.  He thought Syncros were
only made '86 and '87 and  he asked me what engine was in it.  He said it had
137,000 miles, is burgandy, very little rust, great interior and that they
just got it in trade a couple of days ago.
