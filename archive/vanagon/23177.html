Subject: Plastic Parts Needed

I have a 76 Westy and am desparately seeking the following parts:

	1.  Air flow control lever arm (the blue one on the dash).  Mine is
cracked and comes off in your hand if you don't have that extra gentle touch.

	2.  Automatic Transmission shifter knob.  Argh.  Probably impossible to
find!	

I'm in Michigan and don't have much hope of finding these in a junk yard.

Thanks!
