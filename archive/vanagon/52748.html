Well, I remember reading in Business Week (I think) that VW's interest in   
Lopez was simply for his marketing know-how.  In my opinion, there are   
two types of car companies:
 1-Companies who build cars for selling
 2-Companies who build cars for driving

GM clearly build cars for selling and VW, obviously, for driving.  I am   
certain that from VW's standpoint, there is no need to steal secrets from   
a company who cannot even change the oil of a Rabbit.

My two centavos!

Joel and others,
What really gets me is why would VW risk their future and reputation to
steal car designs and and other sensitive information from a sh*t
company like GM??  Why would VW want to lower their standards?  Maybe
they figured their new cars lasted too long.  Maybe they wanted them to
break down more often and wear out more quickly just like those GM cars.

I don't get it, but if VW loses this suit and has to pay GM billions of
dollars, I fear what will happen to VW.  Bankruptcy?  Man, and we think
it's hard and expensive to get parts now!  Imagine if VW went under!
Granted, that's worst-case scenario but I don't like it.
