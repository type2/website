Subject: Re: Obtaining the Refer/sink/stove unit

OK VW Fans,
Does anyone know how or where I might look to find a stove/sink/refer unit to
put into my 86 Wolfsburg Edition Weekender. I was talking to the local VW
shop and was told it wasn't a long and involved project to install, if I
could obtain one.  I was browsing some classifieds last spring before I got
my 86 and remembered someone in PA that has a destroyed Westy and he was
parting it out, he was selling his Stove/sink/refer unit for $600, is that a
fair price? Not that it is still available.  Anyway any leads or info would
be appreciated.
