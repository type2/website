Subject: 91 Aito Transmission Part 3

Well I finally set enough time aside to finish the transmission installation and I'm happy to say 
that everything is working properly. Special thanks to Ron at The Bus Depot for the excellent 
price and quick turnaround on the new CV joints, and for hooking me up with VW Parts Inc. who sold 
me the used transmission. 
I spent this evening redoing a rear wheel bearing. Had to use my homemade press separate the stub 
axle from the bearing housing. Nothing more satisfying than the &quot;pop&quot; of a part being released 
from its death grip on a shaft.
I also have a small coolant leak that appears to be coming from under the thermostat housing. It's 
a real slow drip that only happens when the engine is warm. Where is a good place to start 
looking?
Finally I have a road trip scheduled for next week to Dallas for a family reunion next weekend. 
Anything going on in Dallas next weekend?
I'm installing the TV, VCR and Nintendo 64 in place of the passenger jump seat. I guess we won't 
be hearing much from the kids for the whole trip.
