Subject: Gene Berg's health update

On Saturday 8/26/95 Rusty VanBondo posted a msg. mentioning that GeneB had a
stroke. Called GB Enterprises to order a very minor part this AM and
inquired as to his condition. Although very closed mouth the voice on the
other end did acknowledge that he indeed did suffer a minor stroke on the
plane as he was returning from a show in Norway. He (obviously) was not at
work today but was reportedly feeling &quot;OK.&quot;
