&gt;So Joel Walker says:
&gt;&gt; i get the feeling that the vw dealers are involved in a conspiracy with GM
&gt;&gt; .. those Chevrolet people in the VWOA started it! ... to just be so mean
&gt;&gt; and rotten, that they run everybody away from VW.

I'd say they're doing a pretty good job.  A couple years ago I went to the
VW dealer in Des Moines after rubber air-cleaner to carb. tube for the
Camper (Frau Blucher) and they looked at me like I was dripping slime on
their floor.  Ditto with the VW dealer in Dubuque last year when I needed a
new oil filler cap for the 79.  Royal, supreme jerks one and all.  Thank
God for the parts catalogs, junkyards, and this group!
