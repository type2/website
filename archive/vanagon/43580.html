Subject: 81 fuel delivery help

the adventurewagen has finally been rebuilt, but has yet to live. hopefully
list wisdom will again bail me out.  the mechanic (25 yrs dealership
experience, has his own shop now) is inexperienced with california
vanagon models, and could use a little help. 

the problems: 1) the fuel pump won't activate when turning the key
because no signal is coming from the distributor/hall generator/computer
to enable it (the fuel pump itself works fine, he says the computer tests
out ok also)  2) no pulse to the injectors.  he says all connections have
been checked/etc.  he tried replacing the injector relay, no help.

any ideas/things for him to check would be greatly appreciated.  also, he
says his manual doesn't have the wiring diagrams for the california
model. the bentley shows a little difference between the standard and ca
models, but he says mine is way different.  does anyone know where
else these diagrams might be obtained?  (one would think that a
mechanic might have labeled the nonstandard wires on disassembly, but
i guess some people think they know it all, or just don't think at all.  too
bad i have to pay for someone else's lesson. rant mode off.)

thanks for any help, 
matthew

ps - he's had the van since april 3, and i'm more than ready to get on the
road.  to cultivate empathy for my wheelless condition, i'd also like to
share that my bike got stolen out of my garage last week.
