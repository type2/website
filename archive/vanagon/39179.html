Subject: Central Texas Camping Trip

All you Central Texans, and other interested parties,

I was planning on organizing a camping outing on Memorial Day weekend.
Probably Enchanted Rock State Park as I have been told that there is camping,
swimming, and the ability to get rather loud and obnoxious, and generally
just have a good time without the Park Rangers being called out.  As the
holiday will only be a three day weekend I don't want to have it too far
from Austin, so I can get some other friends to attend, I'm thinking about
1.5 - 2.5 hours drive max.  If there is a better place for this to occur
feel free to let me know, as I am not from the area, and don't know where to
go for the above activities in a camping setting.


After planning all this, I'm sure that something will come up and blow the
whole plan out of the water, but nonetheless I am hoping that this is an
early enough date that I can avoid/work around any such complications.

For those who don't see the message headers my email address is:

Cheers,
