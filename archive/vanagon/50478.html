Subject: GTI Conversions

Hello list,

	When I was shopping for my first westy I found an 82' diesel that
desperatly needed a conversion. It was dangerously slow. I met a guy at
a show with one he used to pull trailers with. He loved this vehicle and
claimed it was the best vanagon he ever owned. The conversion was done
by Elmar at Streetsburo Foreign Auto in Northeastern Ohio. (Phone
available, mail me personally.) This conversion was cheep, under $2000
including all parts. With the availability of rabbit, golf, jetta, ect.
parts including high performance, this conversion has alot of
posibilities. 

	Just some ideas!
