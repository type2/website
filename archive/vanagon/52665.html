Subject: Re: Freeze plug leaking coolant, Leaking head gasket-diesel

&gt;I am wondering if I should replace the head gasket with a &quot;turbo&quot; head gasket
&gt;to avoid a possible breakdown far from home.
&gt; 
&gt;Any experiences with adding a turbo to a non-turbo car?
&gt;
&gt;Much warning before the head gasket goes? 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any info.

My first head gasket gave me no warning at all. I was coming home from a
baseball game with my kids, I turned the corner and the overheat light came
on. I pulled over and shut the engine off immediately. I figured what the
heck and started the engine, the temp was fine and the light was off. I
drove the last 6 mile home woth no problem. Apparently when the gasket went
it put some compression into the coolant system and shutting it down caused
it to burp. I replaced the head gasket the next day. Reused the head bolts.
My second head gasket was actually a broken timing belt. I had about 70,000
miles on the belt and I figured that I would replace it at 100,000 miles.
The belt decided different. I ended up replacing all the guides and all the
valves. Also broke 3 of the cam followers. Luckily it didn't lunch out the
head or the block.
