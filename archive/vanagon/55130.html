Hi, a friend of mine asked me to post this to the list in light of the current
vanagon engine alternative thread.

he has a Mazda RX-7 he's selling for $500.  Obviously, it has the Wankel rotary
engine. I know Kennedy makes an adapter to use this engine in the Beetle (I'm
serious!) so I'm sure they make an adapter to put it in the Vanagon. 

e-mail him for specifics.
