Subject: Need help for Europe Trip

Hello Everyone:

I was wondering if anyone had some good ideas on the following:  

I am planning to honeymoon in Europe and will be arriving in Paris May 2 and
departing from Paris May 21.  My gal and I want to rent a Westfalia for the
trip and tour various countries during that time.  Can anyone tell me how to
go about arranging for one given that we will be flying in/out of Paris?  I
own a 1990 full Westy and we will be psyched if we can track something
similar down for the trip!

By the way, I am currently &quot;unsubscribed&quot; from the group, so I would very
much appreciate it if you would e-mail any suggestions directly to me at
ewilcox_at_aol_dot_com

Thanks loads - Eric Wilcox
