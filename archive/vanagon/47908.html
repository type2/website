&gt; On July 22nd, I bought a 1985 Westfalia with 96,000 miles in Dallas, TX and
&gt; immediately started the 1,600 mile trip home to Wyoming.  The vehicle was
&gt; outstanding during the trip (except for the refrigerator) so I was getting
&gt; the warm, fuzzy feeling about my decision (I am going to sell my '92 Toyota
&gt; Paseo and RELY on the vanagon).
&gt; 
&gt; My son then suggested I subscribe to the list.  I have obviously done so.
&gt; Unfortunately, what I read on the list is rapidly destroying the &quot;warm,
&gt; fuzzy&quot;.  I realize that what I am reading is prejudiced by bad news being
&gt; broadcast more often than good news, and the probability that many of the
&gt; messages coming from people who enjoy working on their vehicle ( I am
&gt; ignorant about mechanics!).  Add to this the fact that Volkswagons are truly
&gt; foreign in Wyoming, and I am certainly trepidatious about my decision.
Once you have the 'warm fuzzies' for any VW, it will *never* go 
away! At least that's my experience. If you keep your Previa beyond 
the warranty, how many Previa owners will pitch in &amp; give you a hand 
when it breaks? 
 
&gt; Maybe I am plain stupid, but in about two weeks, I plan on driving 
the &gt; &quot;Westy&quot; to Seattle and back!
I bought my '88 with 322,000 km on it, then drove on a 5000km trip 3 
weeks later. The only problem was a flat tire. Another 5000km have 
passed, with no other problems, and most of these were on rough 
gravel roads. 

&gt; My first two know tasks will be to replace the thermostat (Is that 
a big
&gt; job?  I know it wasn't that tough twenty years ago in my Dodge) and fixing
&gt; the air conditioning (compressor?, again, major problem?).
Thermostat's not major, but since you will need to bleed the coolant 
system afterwards, you might as well change the coolant, unless you 
know for sure this has been done in the last year.
You should get the Bentley manual before attempting anything on your 
Vanagon, if you plan to maintain it yourself.

Can't help with the a/c...
 &gt; Thanks.
