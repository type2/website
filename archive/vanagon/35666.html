Subject: Tires tires tires!  My recomendations


The vanagon is very demanding on its tires.  The original 185r-14-6PR was
used by VW for many years.  This was chosen due to its ability to carry the
load and provide minimul roling resistance.  This size also provides minimum
traction due to the narrow width.  Starting in '87, VW started as an option,
the 205-70R-14 made by michelin.  This re-inforced sidewall tire provides
improved handling and ride comfort.  Unfortunately this is the only tire
available in this size with the re-inforced side wall.  It is rated to hold
1570 pounds at 40 psi.  (97S)

I have chosen to use a standard load rating 215-70-14.  This provides 1554
pounds of capacity _at_ 35 psi. These provide even more traction than the 205's
and return the diameter to that of the early 185's.  I have a set of
Bridgestone HP-41's on my Syncro Camper and they have worked excellently for
the past 60k.(96H rating)  Unfortunately, they are no longer available in
this size.  I have since installed a number of other tires on Vanagons with
excelent reults.  I'll list them below.

Yokahama A-378,   HR rated, excelent all around tire, works good in snow.
Goodyear Aquatread,  Excelent tire for non-syncro,  Great wet traction,
slightly noisy
Gooyear GSA or GSA aquatread.  Good tire for syncro,  heavy construction,
good handling. Standard GSA probably better for off road/snow, (my opinion,
do not know for sure).
Bridgestone Turanza,  outstanding touring tire, very long life,  Not very
good in snow or mud,(no cross treads to push).  

Of course there are many others. These are the ones I'm experienced with n
customers Vanagons.  Note that most of these tires can now be inflated to
44psi.  This is current tire design technology ued to decrease rolling
resistance for better economy.  This makes them work out wel for the Vanagon.
 I can provide more info on tires for anyone who needs.  Tell me what type of
driving you do and I'll help you out.
Dennis.
