Subject: Dometic Fridge Fan

I've seen a few postings in the archives referring to a fan coming on (or
not) when the fridge is operating.

How do I know if my fridge has one and/or if it is working?  Strictly by
sound?  Is it on all the time, or is there an audible cycling on &amp; off?

Could this be the explanation for insuffiecient cooling (i.e. the ice
melted!).

Would the interior fans (for sale and Camping World or Radio Shack) take
the place of my (missing?) fan?


Thanks
