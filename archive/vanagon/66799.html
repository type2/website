Just keep in mind that every time the fuel pump swallows air may be the lost
time it will pump at all.  The fuel actually flows over the armature and brush
assemblies.  Lack of oxygen keeps the insides from igniting.  Get enough air
in there and boom.  I've seen the cans get distorted from this. All fuel
injection pumps should never be run dry.  This goes for any make of car.
