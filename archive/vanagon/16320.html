&gt;I've got a 1973 Westfalia in very clean condition. I just bought it from 
&gt;the original owner, and it has 146 miles on it. The canvas is good, and 
&gt;it came with a tent and a small hammock that hangs over the front seat. 
&gt;The problem is, I need to carry six peole in this thing. We MAY camp in 
&gt;it. So, can I stip off the westfailia stuff and sell it. Or is there a 
&gt;way to add a jumpseat and seabelt somethwere??

I also had to have six seats in my '73 Westy.  The easiest way is to just 
get an extra back seat seatbelt and fasten it in next to the closet.  The 
left side (facing forward) has a mount next to the existing belt and the 
right side mount is back inside the closet.  Snake it up through the seat 
and you have three seats across the couch, one in the rear facing seat and 
two in the front.
