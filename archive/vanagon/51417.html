I was hoping someone else would notice that.  Unfortunately, in the scenes 
from next week, they are in the van coming towards a truck or something and 
Tuvok yells  &quot;jump&quot;.  I really don't want to think of what happens next....

Well, for those who haven't yet seen this weeks Star Trek Voyager, there's
a bay window bus used as the &quot;getaway&quot; vehicle in one scene. It's got a
hatch on top too.
