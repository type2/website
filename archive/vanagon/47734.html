Subject: Van is repaired...kinda

	Well, the saga continues. Called shop guy onece again to see what
was up, and he says I should come pick it up ASAP and drive it for the rest
of the week, and see how things go.
	They tried everything they knew, and somehow, sometime today they
got the fuel mixture back down where it was supposed to be. He couldnt tell
me what it was that did it, cause they adjusted just about everything, and
of course they cant do that while it running. He said that they started it
up, and all of a sudden it seemed fine again.
	So, anyhow, I'll pick it up tommorow and see how she drives. I'll
go out for a nice long drive and see how much fuel I eat up. I got the guy
at the shop to write down all the things that they checked, and that may
have possibly solved the probelm, just incase while Im half way between
edmonton, and vancouver and it starts again at least Ill have a starting
place.
	He knew that it was not the injectors, the catalytic converter, or
the O2 sensor. Hopefully he'll be able to give me a better explanation
tommorow....hopefully.

thanks again for all the help.
