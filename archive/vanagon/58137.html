Subject: Mirror Mystery

Now that I have my '84 Westy running, I noticed something strange.  The 
Driver's side mirror is slightly convex, providing a nice wide view.  
Since I thought a convex mirror on the driver's side was not allowed on 
US cars, this seemed a bit strange.  Then, I noticed that the passenger 
side mirror was flat, providing a nearly useless view.  I tried swapping 
the mirrors, but couldn't quite adjust them to the correct positions.

So, a few questions:

1) are the two mirrors on an '84 Vanagon interchangable?

2) Is the normal position for the mirror vertical (like mine are), or 
horizontal (like they were when I swapped them)?

Perhaps they were taken apart and re-assembled differently to end up this 
way.

Bill
