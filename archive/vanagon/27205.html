Well then anyone buying a pre '66 vehicle in California is immoral and 
selfish.  Since they don't require any smog testing, and most likely put 
out more smog than most other vehicles.

I'm not very fond of the California smog laws.  If I put FI on my '66 
bus, it fails.  And it's allowed 1200 ppm of HCs.  And in California you 
have to make it pass visually, no cost limit... NONE.  And once you get 
it to pass visual, then there's a $450 limit on 'repairs' to make it pass.

So I belive in doing what it takes to get a vehicle to pass, no matter 
what it it.  But I also like having my vehicle running well.
