     After the recent discussion about fog lights and city lights I got 
to thinking again about upgrading the lights on my 84 (and eventually the 
85) to a 7&quot; H4 light.  
     Does anyone have any experience with these?  There seem to be a few 
different kits, some obviously illegal, some supposedly legal.  What is 
the difference?  And finally, is there any wiring involved?  I'd be 
surprised if the H4's use the sealed beam sockets.

     Thanks,
