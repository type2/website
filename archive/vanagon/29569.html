&gt;Well I've finally got the new-to-me 1990 engine installed in my 87 Syncro.
&gt;It started up just fine but is making a lot of clattering.  I think it's just
&gt;valve lifters, but I'm not sure.  I've run it a total of about 12-15 minutes
&gt;in 75-80 degF weather (to install the coolant) and the clattering hasn't gone
&gt;away yet.  Yes, I did install new oil, and no the oil pressure light is NOT
&gt;on.
&gt;I'm not sure how long this engine has sat before firing it up today.  I got 
&gt;it from the auto wrecker about 6-8weeks ago &amp; my guess is that
&gt;it has been at least several months since it ran.
&gt;My question is, how long could lifter clatter last in an engine that hasn't 
&gt;run in many months?  How can I tell if it's something more serious?
&gt;
&gt;

Dear Jim,

Glad you got the &quot;new&quot; engine running. Has the clatter gone away yet? Our 87
with 111k miles on it had a lifter clatter ocassionally after starting,
would last a few to several minutes. About a month ago I pulled the valve
covers and removed all of the valve adjusting screws, three of them were
badly worn and/or damaged. After replacing all of the adjusting screws the
noise as not reoccured. 

Just as a point of interest we use Castrol Syntec 5-50 oil and VW oil
filters, the interior of the engine is extremely clean. Go figure. BTW I
recently picked up a service/collapseable push rod tube, $41.xx (list - 20%)

Dan
