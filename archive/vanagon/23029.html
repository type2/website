&gt;Reminds, I read an advertisement (old magazine) about Crysler invented the
&gt;minivan.  I am sure that the original VW stationwagen had nothing to do
&gt;with the aforementioned creation.


Just Chrysler's inadvertent way of admitting that all those minivans
are too damned small.


&gt;(Yeah, and Lee I. honestly believed the Pinto was safe.)

Did you hear the Johnny Carson joke (years back) about the safety
of large American cars vs. those pipsqueak German and Japanese models?

He spake: &quot;Of course American cars are safer! They're all sitting
safely in their showrooms!&quot;


gotta love it...
