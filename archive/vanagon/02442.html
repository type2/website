Subject: Re: don'know much about aerodynamics



&gt;MY question about aerodynamics is whether the driprails at the sides of the
&gt;windshield contribute disproportionately to wind noise.  I almost got up the
&gt;nerve to cut 'em off before I had the van painted.  
&gt;B.
&gt;
&gt;
	Don't cut them off. Try fairing them with putty or
	plasticene. I'll include your data in my paper.
