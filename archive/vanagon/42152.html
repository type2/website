Subject: Re: CV joint bolt tools

&gt;&gt; 4.  Where is a good place to get the 12 point tool for removing CV joints
&gt;&gt; with the dreaded connections?  Thanks

Best ones are made by Hazett in 3/8 drive socket.  You can get a set from 
Automotion, a Porsche parts place, they have a 1-800, located in CA.  Single 
sockets avail.  Unlike using a regular Allen wrench, 6mm, the 12 pts. are 
tapered slightly. So when you get them in and tap on them gently they get an 
incredible grip.  I've used mine to get out bolts that have been stripped 
out by using Allen wrenches.  Just bang them in and turn without rocking the 
tool.  There is no comparison.  Use a good Allen wrench on the hex head 
socket bolts however. For those go to Sears and buy the ones that use 3/8 
drive. Add a 6&quot; extension and go to it.  Way better/faster than a regular 
Allen wrench. I've easily spent $20 on poor quality Allen wrench sets, 
busting the 6mm one on CVs after a couple of years.  I don't worry about 
getting off a CV bolt anymore, between the Sears Allen driver and the Hazett 
I'm covered.  I use a set of ball ended Allen wrenches to speed getting out 
the bolts once loose, nice to be able to tilt the wrench a bit while doing 
CVs.  Tim Smith
