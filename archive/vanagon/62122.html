Subject: RE: Power Steering Fluid Loss

For loss of power steering fluid check the ends of the steering rack - inside 
the boots. The rack in my '87 began leaking, but nothing dripped for a long 
time since the fluid just collected in the boots.

If you need to replace the rack, it could be that debris or filings from the 
pump have damaged the TFE seals in the old rack, and you should also at least 
replace the P/S filter (in the fluid tank) - and possibly the pump, or the 
same may happen to the new rack.

&gt;Now I'll have to go out and find out where the power
&gt;steering fluid is going.                                 Larry Carter
