Sorry to continue this chain, but if you read the original note, this virus 
warning has some truth.

The issue isn't the message itself, but the attachment.  You can open the 
message safely but many mail readers look at the file type of an attachment 
and try to do something with it automatically.  In this case the attachment 
is a .COM file, so the mail reader executes it for you if you ask it to 
open the attachment.

In all, nothing is new here.  You can open any message safely, but never 
open any attachment unless you are confident of its source.

Mike
