Here's my Zwie Pfennig's worth:

Dual battery retro-fits are seldom sucessful.  It usually just brings 
double-trouble.  Even carefully engineered systems are not completely 
satisfactory.  They must be carefully managed and monitored for 
symptoms of impending failure.
It's vitally important to have matched storage batteries if the pair 
are to be parallel connected to the load/charging circuits. Viz: 
identical capacity and bearing the same lot number.
There are many factors affecting battery life/failure and the charging 
system should be capable of charging the batteries up to the specified 
&quot;equalize charge voltage&quot; and then reducing the current so that the 
batteries assume a &quot;float maintenance voltage&quot;.  This is no simple task 
when temperature fluctuations are factored into the formula.
