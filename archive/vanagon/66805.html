Subject:      E Mail Problem on New Website

There is a problem with the mailboxes on the new website (incoming mail
keeps bouncing back to the sender[s]), so until further notice, please
continue contacting me at:

oldvolkshome1_at_juno_dot_com

OR

uvx196_at_juno_dot_com
Note:  I get all of the list(s) mail at this address and it takes time to
&quot;sift&quot; though.

Marc (duelist_at_azaccess_dot_com) who's really gone out of his way to set up
the site apparently hasn't figured out why mail to the addresses on the
pages keep getting bounced, but he'll let me know when it's fixed.  Guess
it's part of the &quot;growing pains&quot;.  It will work out eventually, I'm sure.

Thanks to those who posted compliments and the E-Mail comments.
