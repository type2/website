&gt; Does anybody know how to maintain the Vanagon's capability as a
&gt; 5-person people mover and yet enjoy the go-anywhere-anytime freedom
&gt; of those wonderful Westy's?  I'm thinking specifically of fitting a 
&gt; jumpseat behind the forward passenger's seat, as is done (on both
&gt; sides) in some of the late Wolfsburg Edition Vanagons.  
&gt; 
	         
	I believe there are billets for seat mounting bolts under the floor
	(that gray plasticky cover) in all Vanagons. Some campers came with
	a removable single seat and some came with a removable 2-person
	seat. There is a '90 Camper GL on a lot in Portland OR right now
	that has one of the 2-seater bench seats mounted.

	Whether a camper came with a 3rd seat or not, I strongly suspect
	all bodys have the mounting holes. I've contemplated lifting the
	floor to look. I'd like to have a rear seat that's closer to the
	front so passengers can converse easier. I have friends that
	give me crap about having to sit in the back and not be able to
	hear discussion up front, get chilled by the funky A/C ducting
	and get hammered by the music. But, they also love the legroom
	and proximity to the wine in the fridge:-)

	One of the slick features of the Canadian Eurovan Westphalia was
	the rear seat rolled forward easily to make for a better social
	4-seater.
