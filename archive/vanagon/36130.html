Subject: Syncro Swivel Seating?

I've been thinking about putting Westy swivel seats in the 
front of my '89 Syncro (non-Westy).  There seems to be some 
welding to the frame underneath the seat required, which I'd 
be willing to go through for this feature.  Two questions, 
however:

1) I've been told that the overall seat height is higher on 
these rotating seats by about an inch and a half over normal 
Vanagon front seats.  Can it be true that all you Westy 
drivers are sitting that much higher in the saddle?

2) My source also claims that the driver's seat in the Westy 
doesn't even turn around all the way - only 90 degrees, since 
the steering wheel is in the way.  I am also somewhat 
skeptical of this.  If true, it seems like it would seriously 
compromise the utility of the swivel feature - it would 
certainly be enough for me to give up on the idea, considering 
the work of a retrofit.

What say ye, late-model Westfalians?
