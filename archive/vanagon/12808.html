I have a '79 engine but the heater boxes are rotten out.  As far as I can see 
the boxes and muffler are identical to the '72 to '74 systems except for the 
attachment to the manifold.  The '72 to 74 units used a type 4 connection 
with a oval copper washer while the '79 used a flat connection with a 
rectangular port.  The problem is to get the vanagon exhaust flange onto 
the the '72 to '74 heater bax.  The muffler was never the problem.  

Does this guy make the heater baxes of just the mufflers?

&gt; 
&gt; and also for all vanagons ...
&gt; 
&gt; robert was looking for a non-dealer exhaust system, and i recalled that i
&gt; had called Borla (Oxnard, California) (805) 986-8600  a while back and the
&gt; fellow said he had an 84 vanagon and was trying to get the company to make
&gt; the vanagon exhaust system.
&gt; 
&gt; so i called (once i got the above now-correct number) and talked to Tim,
&gt; in Tech Support. he said they did NOT make anything for the vanagons (water
&gt; or air-cooled) right now, BUT &lt;drum-rolllllllll&gt; IF anybody orders 20 or more
&gt; of them, they WILL make them. said it would take about six weeks to get the
&gt; specs, gear up, and fit it into the schedule.  the 20 units is the minimum
&gt; order for special stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; as i recall, the price quoted to me was about $200 for the muffler (while the
&gt; dealer is about $500 retail), so we are talking about $4000 minimum order
&gt; (depending on what Borla decides the price would be).
&gt; 
&gt; so ... are there 20 or more of you out there that need mufflers (or other
&gt; exhaust parts)? he said it didn't matter whether it was air-cooled or water-
&gt; cooled (and the 1978-79 buses ought to be able to use the 1980-1983 vanagon
&gt; stuff) ... as long as there were 20 units ordered. i'm assuming there might
&gt; need to be 20 air-cools and 20 20 water-cools (i don't think the two would
&gt; be able to use the same mufflers/etc).
&gt; 
&gt; anybody want to take this hot potato? :)
