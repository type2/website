In regard to Porsche cleaning up its aircooled engine...it did it
by making it partially water-cooled...the heads on the 911 are
watercooled....so the engine isn't entirely aircooled anymore...
I suppose VW could have put in a wasserboxer in the bug..like it
did with the Vanagon, but the design of the bug, in terms of
the market place, is so out of date.
