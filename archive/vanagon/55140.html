Subject: TDC ?


I'm getting mixed messages from my Haynes and Muir on the meaning of TDC
(especially as it relates to being in proper position to install the
distributor driveshaft and adjust valves).

I've always understood TDC as position at which the #1 piston is at the
top of the cyclinder (viewable with a light down the spark plug or
air intake holes on the top side of the head), and the rotor is just
coming in-line with the notch on the distributor. This also coincides with
the 0 degree indendation in the fan (timing scale). All of this
corresponds to the end of the compression stroke (both intake and exhaust
valved closed and the pison has moved from the bottom of the cylinder to
the top compressing the air-fuel mixture) ... just before the plug is
about to fire.

Well ... the MANUALS seem to indicate that TDC is reached just after the
intake valve closes completely, which means the piston is at the bottom of
the cylinder (the beginning of the compression stroke!). This can't be 
TDC ?

What am I missing ?

Cheers, Chris
