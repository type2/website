&gt; Any EV owners have any recommendations about a
&gt; source for quality mudflaps?  My propane system
&gt; is covered in a salty slush all the time.

	Got mine from the dealer.  Very nice.  (i.e. they fit perfectly and
they have the VW logo.)   A bit pricey at ~$30.  Got
'em on the front only.  They are effective but won't eliminate the problem
you refer to.
