Subject:      pre-FFFFriday: the Resto Blues

well, you guys were singing so forlornly that it seemed to be a song ...


I bought an old bus from a fellow quite mellow
Who needed the money; the bus it was yellow.
I figured it wouldn't take ME much to fix it,
In time for the summer shows.

But as I began, all the horrors showed clearly,
It started to cost me, and cost me quite dearly,
My weekends and then all my evenings were taken
As I got the Resto Blues.

At first it was rust which had been painted over,
And then came the Bondo like white cliffs of Dover,
The tools and the welding and sanding and painting,
Will give you the Resto Blues.

And here it is now, many years since I started,
The bus is still here, and I'm broke and down-hearted,
It needed more work than I thought when I bought it.
Oh, I've got the Resto Blues.
