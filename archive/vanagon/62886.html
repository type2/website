Scott -

I would re-check Bentley again (see page 28.30 - mine's a '89 edition). 
Chart there says on the third &amp; fourth line down 5 degrees AFTER TDC at
850rpm  plus or minus 50rpm.

Gap your plugs at .028 - Autolite's way off base here.  Use Bosch W7CC0
Plugs - wouldn't go near any other mfr.

Joel Walker and John Hathaway recommend upgrading the spark plugs to a
Bosch W7DTC or the resistor version  WR7DTC.  These are Tri-Electrode
Plugs, meaning they have 3 Electrodes instead of the one, similar to
what's used in the Mazda RX7's.  Upon inspecting them, it appears that
Bosch pre-gaps them for you.  They claim that the mileage and the overall
running smoothness can be better, depending on your engine's and FI's
condition.  They aren't cheap, but they are said to last longer too. 
Gonna be changing to these in the next few weeks.

Everything else looks good on your list.  Use Mann/Mahle/Knecht Oil and
Air Filters and use Bosch for the Fuel Filter - These are the best in my
book of experience.

&gt;I am giving my newly purchased '85 Westie a standard &quot;tune up&quot; in a 
&gt;few
&gt;days. My local shop wanted $220 for this so I am doing it myself. I 
&gt;plan
&gt;to:
&gt;
&gt;Replace oil and filter 
&gt;Replace air filter
&gt;Replace distributor &amp; cap
&gt;Replace plugs (Bentley says to gap these at .028, Autolite says .044 -
&gt;anyone know who is right?)
&gt;Replace gas filter 
&gt;
&gt;I also plan to adjust the timing and idle. Any tricks to know about
&gt;this? I know to do the timing first. Bentley says to adjust the timing
&gt;at 2000-2500 RPM. Is this correct? 
&gt;
&gt;Am I missing anything else? I am used to Mazda Pickups and not yet
&gt;intimate with VWs.
