There is no opening from the engine intake to the interior, at least in the 
factory setup. Maybe Adventurewagon roof bolt/fixation is leaking. 
        Things that it may be... clean up the trough around the door opening 
at the top of the hatch. Leaves etc will build up causing water to drain in 
past the rubber, rather than down the sides towards the tail lights.  If you 
have a rear window washer/wiper has the pipe that goes from reservoir to 
window broken, up inside the rubber tube where all the wiring is? This 
happened to me and produced the same wet cushion/mat you describe. I thought 
the pump was just weak and pumped 1/2 gal of fluid into the van body.

Try 'Fantastic' spray cleaner, works wonders. Watch out for the nicotine 
laced showers if the PO was a heavy smoker. Use it evenly as it will 
overbleach if left on too long or thick. Dunno about the glue.   tim s.
