Subject: Re: Master Cylinder brake light switch....

steve said:

How interchangable/swap-able are the switches in the
master cylinder???  I was checking my connection out and
one of the push-on stubs broke off on in the push-on while
trying to make a better connection.  Soooo I gotta get another
switch.  It's for the '64 Single cab.  What's my window of
interchange here?
-----

get a new one - they are only ~$5.   

 But as far as i know, they are the same 61-67.  before that they have screw
terminals, but are other wise the same.  after that i don't know.
