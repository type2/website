the beetle convertible is not a rarity by any stretch...
very common...and cheap by our standards--$6000us dollars...the difficulty
in getting one back here has been addressed in this forum many times...At

&gt;hmmm.....a '97 beetle conv???   I dunno about that...
&gt;As far as i know the only mexican made bugs were hardtops, and the last bug
&gt;conv. was made by Karmann in Germany in early '80....
&gt;
&gt;maybe someone made the bug into a conv. with a top frame off a junked '70's
&gt;bug conv??
&gt;highly  possible..with a welder, you can do anything...  :&lt;)
&gt;
&gt;anybody else know??
