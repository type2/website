Subject: Re: Rear bumper mods???

I saw a rear bumper that was made from a piece of 4&quot; square pipe.  The pipe
was sectioned so that it was roughly the shape of the original bumper.  It
was mounted further away from the body than the original because it did not
have the curve.  It was painted the same color as the body and had VW rabbit
end caps held on with springs.  It looked really good - almost stock.  The
van was GTI powered and had a hefty trailer hitch that the owner used to haul
a small boat.  The trailer hitch was mounted to the bumper.  The owner said
he could not wait til someone rear-ended him.
