&gt; Ever driven one of those Ford 2800 V-6's? It is the most gutless
&gt; engine (for its displacement) on the market, even when it was still
&gt; in the Ford. Was this the first of the &quot;smog&quot; motors? Depends on the
&gt; year, perhaps. But a few Fox-body Mustangs I've driven with
&gt; that engine... the four-cyl engine is actually quicker, and gets
&gt; better gas mileage. Now, the 2600 Ford V-6 that was in the '72 and '73
&gt; Capri, is a whole different animal-- it hauls!

Steve,
	Speaking from experience, the 2800 V-6 is not much different in
power output than the 2600.  I have had both in my Capri and the 2800
feels faster, although only slightly.  I think the 2600 is rated 107hp
with 130 lb/ft of torque, while the 2800 is 105hp with 140lb/ft.  Not
too impressive, as you point out, but this was in 1973/74, and back
then, that was a lot of muscle for a 2300 pound car.  I have added a few
goodies to my 2.8, like headers, Offenhauser manifold, and a Holley 390
4-barrel carb, and it's a pretty quick car now, although as the original
poster said, it gets terrible mileage due to very short gearing.  Sorry
about the non-VW related content, but I just had to preserve the honor
of the 2.8 engine (or try, at least)  :)
