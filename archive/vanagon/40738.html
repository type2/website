Subject: oh yeah

	While fooling around with Little Martha's clutch pedal and 
lever, etc, I removed what Bentley calls the 'assmebly', which is a pivot
bearing. Its also apparently perfect for raising young spiders-
there were more than 5 different spider egg nests, and one spider,
in this little stamped steel cup. I cleaned out the nests carefully
and put the spider on its way. Be careful with little gizzy things
like this when the bus has been parked for a while... or even not.

	Also, there's a sealing o-ring inside the pivot, which seals
the greasy part from the outside world, a sliding seal against the 
replacable lever the cable connects to. RMMW does not list this o-ring-
might still be available from the dealers. Point is, if you get in
there, look for it, and add one of you don't find one. 

	Bill
