 Tim,

 I'm not a transmission expert by any means, and the only transmissions I've
 rebuilt are from motorcycles, but here is what I think happens that causes
 popping out of gear.

 The gearsets are in constant mesh &lt;except for reverse&gt; and are engaged
 to the input or output shaft by a collar that that is splined to said
 shaft can carrys something referred to as a &quot;dog clutch&quot;. The dog clutch
 has radial teeth that match with radial slots in the face of the gear to 
 be engaged. What causes popping out of gear is damage to the shape of
 the teeth and slots on the dog clutch and gear. When new they are undercut
 slightly so that when torque is applied to the engaged gear the dog clutch
 is pulled ever tighter. As the teeth get beat up and worn the effect is a
 taper going the other way so that the application of torque wants to &quot;spit&quot;
 the dog clutch out of the recesses in the gear.

 Now, in a perfect world those teeth would never wear because there is a
 synchronizer ring there to protect them from damage. The synchronizer ring
 is the first part of the collar assembly to engage the slots in the gear, and
 through friction, is supposed to speed up or slow down the gearset so that
 the collar and the gearset are rotating at the same speed &lt;rpm&gt; when the 
 dog clutch engages the slots. If this were always the case, the dogs would
 slide into the slots without damage. 

 But, the sychronizers wear and don't work as well. Sometimes we pull too hard
 on the shift lever and we &quot;beat&quot; the synchronizers - that is to say, we 
 force the dog clutch into engagement before the synchronizer has had enough
 time to match the speeds of the collar and the gearset. All this results
 in damage to the shape of the teeth on the dog clutch  and the resultant
 &quot;pop&quot; out of gear.

 I don't think that any gearbox is immune to this. Wear on the synchronizers
 can be accelerated by a clutch &lt;or clutching technique&gt; that doesn't release
 fully or by a bad pilot bearing. It's conceiveable &lt;at least to me&gt; that
 a driving technique where the engine speed is matched to the correct speed
 required by the gearset-to-be-engaged would reduce the demands placed on the
 synchro rings. In the school buses that I drove &lt;part time job during 
 college years&gt; that was the ONLY way to get those big gearboxes to go
 into gear at all.

 To repair the problem looks to me like it would require complete dis-
 assembly of the transmission since the damaged parts in question are 
 located between the gearsets. It isn't clear to me at all why the 
 Syncro gearbox should be so outrageously expensive to get worked on. Steve
 Hoge and I were looking through his copy of Bentley and the 4wd gearbox
 doesn't look all THAT different. Especially in the gearcase proper where
 4th gear is located. Getting the transmission OUT looks to be more of a
 chore though.


 Good Luck!

 Dave
