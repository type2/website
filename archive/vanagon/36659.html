Dave,

The 115 speed can be explained by a couple of things...tail 
wind...speedometer error....driving down hill (look at a map...
England is higher on a map than France is, therefore to go to
France from England you are driving down), etc.

It does sound feasable considering I've driven the 2.0L version
at 100....that's all that I said.
