Subject: Re: Question about 86 Synchro Weekender

&gt;| If they're not talking about the std westy, then the weekender package
&gt;| consists of :
&gt;| 
&gt;| -back seat folds down into a sofabed with a cushion over the engine.
&gt;| -back of middle seat folds down (split seat)

	As we rehash this again, isn't this the VW weekender package (I have
the above interior and no westy placards attached anywhere). I thought the
westy weekender had something like the fridge and the poptop but no
stove/sink/other cabients.
