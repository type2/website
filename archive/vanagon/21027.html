I work in electronic defense, and we have all sorts of skills available here. 
I know that stainless can be welded (in fact, come to think of it, about 10
years ago I was responsible for a job, one component of which involved the
welding of 1/4&quot; stainless steel plates), so I went and asked one of my
mechanical engineering friends.

 You can weld stainless, but probably need a Metal Inert Gas (MIG) or Tungston
Inert Gas (TIG) welding rig that most muffler and or auto shops aren't going
to have.  A body shop might  have one or check in the yellow pages under
welding.  For that, you may have to pull the part and take it in.
