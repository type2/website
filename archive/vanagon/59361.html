Subject: 1.9L cracked heads

To all:

Has anyone had problems with cracked heads on the 1.9L?  The hairline cracks
I have found are between the intake and exhaust valves on each head.  
1.  Is there a way to repair the cracks?
2.  Will it really effect the engine preformance if I don't repair them?
3.  Anyone have a set of used heads (not cracked) laying around?

Any info available on the 1.9L heads is much appreciated. Thanks

                                                                   Scott
