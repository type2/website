Subject: Existence of Archives

I plan to purchase a 1987 VanagonGL camper tomorrow morning.  My
mechanic gave it the okay today.  I've been reading this bboard for a
few months and have obtained some excellent information from it.  I
would like to know if historical information is archived and, if it is,
how does one access it.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
