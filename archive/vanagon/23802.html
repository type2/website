Subject: Re: Vanagon motor swap???

While at Larry's Bugjam last weekend in Dayton, I saw an 82 Diesal that
someone had started to convert to a Ford V6. It had a KEP adapter and the
motor was in. Still had a lot of work to go (motor mounts, exhaust, etc..)
It was for sale in the swap meet area. Looking for best offer. My guess is
$1000 would have taken it. It was on a trailer. Sorry didnt get the phone
number.

My suggestion for a motor transplant is to use a rotory engine from an RX7.
It is small. It pumps out a bunch of horses. It has a German heritage
(Wankel). OK, so it aint gonna be cheap. 

More speed = More money. More money = More speed. This is true except for
putting money in vanagon motors.
