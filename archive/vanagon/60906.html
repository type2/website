&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't want to start another week long discussion on motor oil.
&gt;&gt;But what weight oil should I put in my 84 Westy.  I have been told
&gt;&gt;several things.  Right now I am leaning toward 20w-50. ??????

&gt;I would bet that the CW on the net says 20W50.  Certainly for summer in
&gt;most parts of the world this would seem to make sense.  However, I just got
&gt;my oil changed at a VW dealer.  They used 15W40 and claimed this is per VWs
&gt;recommendation.  I am not that well versed on the topic but think this may
&gt;be regional.  Vancouver is cool year round so I am not worried if someone
&gt;got it wrong.  
&gt;
&gt;By the way, the oil change was free (C$7.00 for the filter).  All I had to
&gt;do was download a coupon from the net.
