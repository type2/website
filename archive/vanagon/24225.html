Subject: This List

I am so excited.  I have only been subscribed to this list for one day 
and have already come away with a wealth of technical information and 
trip journals.  Too Cool!

Just today, I have found:

A local VW club which happens to be meeting tomorrow
Colour Codes for my '66 Bus project (Pearl White and Velvet Green)
Great advice on what to do with my Cargo Floors
...and a couple nice trip journals

My hat off to all those that I have already received information from and 
I look forward to contiued chat in the future!
