Subject: 90 Westfalia fridge questions

We recently purchased our first Westfalia - a beautiful '90 in fabulous
condition.  I'm trying to learn the absolute basics of how to make
everything work, and have a few questions about the fridge...

- we have a hard time getting the fridge going on propane; are there any
tricks to how best/how long to pump to get it going?  It seems to start, and
then after a few seconds it goes off;

- switching to the battery, I was surprised - and concerned! - that I didn't
seem to be able to turn it off by pressing the buttons as indicated in the
instruction manual; the fan kept running even though none of the three mode
buttons was depressed!  Is there something that can keep the fan going for a
period of time even though the unit is 'unpowered'?

- how much of a drain on the battery is exerted by the fridge?  The little
toggle switch that shows the battery condition as a green/yellow/red light
doesn't show anything now, yet the vehicle starts without any problems.  Is
the lack of any lights a serious problem?

- is a second battery for the fridge (and possibly the radio) recommended so
that there's no risk of runnnig down the main battery? Is this a difficult
thing to install?  What's the best place to store a second battery, given
wiring and accessibility considerations?

Any and all help/suggestions/comments are greatly appreciated!  If this has
all been covered before, my apologies - we're new to the mailing list.

TIA
