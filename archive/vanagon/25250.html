Subject: for sale: my beast, an 86 synchro

Hi again2!

I am the happy owner of an 1986 GL Synchro, who unfortunately (:~() now
finds it necessary to liquidate my only real asset &amp; travelling companion.
(Work prohibited me from selling the MAC.) 

According to Edmunds the avg price is ~$4200 and given the prices I've seen
on the net this seems fair:

   1986 VW Vanagon GL Synchro
       General
        -135,700 miles
        -well maintained by VW mechanics
        -never in an accident
       Exterior
        -grey w/ silver+red 4x4 stripe at mid-body
        -still holds a polish (no sun fading)
        -minor rust (paint bubbling/flaking; no holes) on some body seams
        -one minor dink at left front headlight (I still don't know where
that shopping 
         cart came from)
        -three of 4 original hubcaps
       Interior
        -blue fabric seats throughout (great condition - no tears/stains;
the most 
          comfortable    
          driving position of any car I have owned)
        -blue carpet (clean in rear &amp; front passenger; driver's side a
&quot;worn blue&quot;)
        -air conditioning (it takes a while on really hot days, but it works)
        -new AM/FM cassette deck
        -rear hatch struts need to be replaced (non-VW strut ~$25)
        -front passenger window handle needs to be replaced
       Mechanical
        -standard 2.1 engine (strong &amp; reliable) &amp; manual 4sp+granny gear
        -regular oil change (every 3000 miles)
        -regular tune-up (~once a year)
        -no leaks (engine compartment is unbelievably clean)
        -does not burn oil
        -standard Vanagon intermitent overheating problem on highway
        -mechanic thinks there maybe possible (repeat possible) leak at
water           
         pump or head
        -recent flush &amp; fill of cooling system
        -plenty of wear left on 205-70r-14 tires
        -recent brake job

Thanks,
jso
