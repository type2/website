Subject: CV left front outer :( for'90 syncro westy

My local non-VW specfic mechanic (my vw guy left my area) verbalized my
thoughts- S--- happens!  The clicking noise completely disappeared for 2 days
but is back.  From list info, I've asked (not demanded) greasing the joints,
but he felt the labor charge wouldn't be cost effective for me...  I have no
love of being a grease monkey, but I'm not a wimp &amp; if learning the nasty job
will prolong Tug's life, I plan to accept John A's teaching offer for the
remaining ones.  

As I prolong the inevitable, what am I destroying?  Assuming the correct
diagnosis (he said boot's slightly torn) &amp; considering labor cost, what
options would you consider if you were me?  Preliminary cost queries
revealed:  $77.42 just boot (outer joint kit??) or wheel shaft outer with
251498099E outer joint $358.74 (Walser, AZ)  Monday I'll check for both inner
&amp; outer joints.  I've printed many posts from the '96 archives but will
appreciate direct help re parts (rebuid good/bad idea?) and repair parts &amp;
Volks in Frederick MD, Winchester &amp; Manassas VA triangle.        TIA!
