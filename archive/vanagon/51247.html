&gt;You can get higher-wattage bulbs for the rectangular lights but you won't
&gt;get much benefit from them unless you wire them directly to the
&gt;alternator/battery via relays controlled by your existing headlight circuit.
&gt;Otherwise, the voltage drop across the existing circuit will nullify any
&gt;increase in brightness. Even with the higher wattage lamps and rewiring, I
&gt;don't think you'll do as well as with the round 7&quot; Hella lens and H4
&gt;combination.

You can't get past the lousey retangular reflectors.  The beam distribution
just plain sucks.  One can always get the euro H4s from Europe at $130 per
side (not including bulbs!).
