BEWARE!!!
&gt; 	Having said that, there are a couple of things that might help.
&gt; First of all, I assume that you bought a 1200 *watt* inverter (boy are
&gt; those expensive!).  If it puts out 1200 watts that means it is requiring
&gt; more than 100 *amps* from your battery at full load, and probably at least
&gt; 60 amps running the microwave (including conversion-related losses). I
&gt; would first check that you are using wire large enough to support a 100 amp
&gt; load (I would guess at least 8 gauge, probably 6) to hook it up.

NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	A 100apm load from a 12V device is huge!!!
	Use at least 4ga wire and I would recommend running 2 4ga wires
	in parallel for anything this HOT!!! The amount of current a run of 
	wire can support is related directly to 2 things: most importantly,
	the cross sectional area of the wirepath, and seccondly, the length 
	of the run. Power = Current*Current*Resistance; with such a high
	current, reducing the resistance is critical. I presume the length 
	of the run is fixed, so the only variable remaining X sectional area.
	Make it as big as you practically can! The Power consumed is also 
	somewhat constant, so if you are drawing Xamps across Yfeet of cable
	run, then for a small cable (8ga-) you may overheat (excess resistance)
	the cable to a dangerous level while at the same time nuking the 
	battery. Drawing big power from a small source will tend to ruin the 
	small source.
	1200W is an increadible amount of power to be removed from a 12V 
	source and any plans to do so must be very carefully thought out!!!
 
&gt; 	Second, make sure that your battery is capable of producing that
&gt; kind of current at 12 volts.  If the battery is small or not too new it
&gt; might only be holding 8 or 10 volts under that 60 amp load.  That would
&gt; almost surely cause the microwave's performance to suffer.
	
	Not many batteries are capable of doing this, and those that are 
	probably cost more than your inverter. Of course your battery may do 
	it now, but with weekend use, I doubt you'd get a full year out of it.

 

&gt; 1200 watts is kind of overkill for a VW Van, IMHO.
					       ^^^^^
Don't be shy man, were talkin' safety here. w/o a super duper high dollar 
RV setup this is dangerous. PLEASE BELIEVE ME, I want the same power you want
(I just haven't found a safe, cost effective {under $4K} way to do it).
