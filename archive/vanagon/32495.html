Subject: Re: Mr. Holland's Opus with lot's of VW busses

&gt;We saw a movie last night that is a must see for musicians
&gt;and bus owners. It's called Mr. Holland's Opus, and it
&gt;starts in the late 60s. There are bugs and busses all

        I haven't seen it yet, but my choir director (yes, I sing in a
church choir) saw it and highly recomended it. Now that I know it has
busses as well as music, I shall be obligated to see it at my earliest
convenience...  ;-)

Peace,
