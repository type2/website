So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; as i recall from days when i had square headlights :)  the replacement
&gt; glass parts CAN be ordered separately.
&gt; 
&gt; now ... when you recover from the heart attack that you will surely have
&gt; when they tell you the price for that fixture, let me know. if you can't
&gt; find one in a local junkyard, i might be able to help.

I haven't started looking into it yet, but I thought that the wrecking
yard would be a good place to start.  I hope the earlier lenses fit.
I won't even bother with the dealer.
