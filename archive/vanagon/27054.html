When I got my bus I had to run a new wire for the horn.  The way I did it 
was to remove the plate at the bottom and shove the wire down the 
steering comulmn.  Just thought I would mention how I did it.  I was very 
new to VWs and vehicles at the time, so I did it the only way that seemed 
possible.
