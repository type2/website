Gavin,
I've been very pleased with the dependability and utility of my 81 
Westy.  A good one (with a gas heater, useful if you live in cold climes) 
should be right in your ballpark, $$ wise.  

Plus, I can help you with certain problem areas such as leaking gas 
tanks, gas heaters and shade tree adjustment of the AFC when it won't 
pass emissions ;).

&gt; After a few years of being curious about owning a vw camper, I have decided
&gt; to take the plunge. Part of me can't wait to have one but I don't want to
&gt; make a bad choice. Please can you offer me your expertise?
&gt; 
&gt; I have started researching how the vans have evolved but do not yet have a
&gt; clear sense of what would be best for me.
&gt; 
&gt; My definite criteria are: under $4,000; manual transmission; and a pop
&gt; top/westfalia.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From what I have read, I assume I should avoid a pre-1977.5 in order to not
&gt; deal with adjusting the valves. I also read that the after 1980 the
&gt; suspension/ handling improved due to the wishbone front suspension. And
&gt; finally, I have heard that after 1983, the first few years of the water
&gt; cooled engine were trouble prone. I am assuming that given my budget there
&gt; is no way that I can purchase a trouble free Wasserboxer (i.e., mid-late
&gt; 80's on). So right now I am looking at 80-83's.
&gt; 
&gt; Are my assumptions correct? What has been your experience? What do you wish
&gt; you had done that you didn't? Should I save up more money or can I get a
&gt; fun vehicle which I drive more than I repair?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for your help.
&gt; See you on the road...
