Subject: Joel, change the statz...

Joel,
	Time to change the statz again. I just sold my '86 syncro. Almost 2 months
to find someone in the area who could appreciate it.
	Now it's time to get moved and then think about what kind of vw to get
this time! I guess I'm down to a wannabuser.
	Later all,

'86 Syncro GL (Sold, now I'm a wannabuser! How long before I'm a Needabuser?)
