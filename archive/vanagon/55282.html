Subject: 82 Vanagon Diesel Gas w/ ngas engine FS Northern Cal.

--   Listees,

  I've posted this van Twice, I've had a tiny bit of response on it.  
But nobody has really been interested?

  I wanted to post it again to see if maybe someone that might be 
interested may have missed it?

  E-mail me for details on this van.  $1200.00, engine is blown, I have 
a # of Low milage engines to offer too at a reasonable price.
