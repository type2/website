Subject: What's a &quot;Tri Star&quot; ?

I know that there is a version of the Vanagon single and double cab called the
&quot;TriStar&quot;, all decked out in carat trim,  accessories and syncro, but is &quot;Tri
Star&quot; the name of the coachwork company who does the add ons ( sort of like Binz
coachwerks in doing the pre '58 doublecabs ) or is it solely a VW made model?
Any Tri Star owners care to elaborate with a short history?
