Subject: Dealer service ripoff?



&gt;   rotors or drums&quot; and they'd have to be replaced.  Material cost for rotors,
&gt;   drums, pads and shoes: $600.  Labor: 4 hours front, 4.5 hours rear.

rotors, I understand (too much torque on them -- you need them thick &amp; strong).
but drums?   They hardly undergo any amount of torque as compared to the 
front rotors....

Anyways, when I had the rotors changed on my Vanagons, I odered the
rotors from aftermarket sources -- cost $200.00 .  I remember that the
VW made ones were priced at around $400.00
