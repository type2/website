     Oh Dave,
     
     &gt;I'm confused now! Front bumper, two overiders, three tube/towel rail 
     &gt;sections? Or is that tube all one continuous piece? I thought it was 
     &gt;in three little sections; the bit I want is the long slightly curved 
     &gt;section that goes between the overiders sitting under the V shape on 
     &gt;the body....or have I got all this wrong? Or maybe I'm confusing 
     &gt;everybody....
     &gt;That's the bit...does it exist on it's own or is it part of the whole 
     &gt;thing, sides and all....       Dave
     
     what you mean you don't know?? ;)
     
     The front tube is well a single tube. It bolts through the bumper 
     close to the bottom door hinges via a captive nut in the ends of the 
     tubes. It also bolts to the back of each of the overrides.
     
     I got mine off Jon Abbot (0121-558-9135), and i'd say it was 
     rust-free, it was chromed!
     
     I considered making the front tubes as well as the rears (even out of 
     stainless steel) but I thought that they were relatively easy to come 
     by so i didn't bother. I knew that the rears were mega rare and the 
     ten that I made all sold at Bug Freeze last year.
     
     Lee.
