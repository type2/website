those front grills are brittle, eh? I've broken off a bit of mine while
trying to pusht the van out of a muddy spot. I managed to glue it back on
with polystyrene cement (what memories that stuff recalls!) which worked
for about 8 months. I don't think toluene is the best solvent for whatever
plastic the grill is made of. Ive just re-glued it with fly tying head
cement (Loon brand). At the wreckers, you never seem to find a complete
grill, but I am toying with the idea of cutting up a broken grill for
replacement bits for my grill, which if left unhelped, will probably end
up looking like a photo from the Big Book of British smiles.
