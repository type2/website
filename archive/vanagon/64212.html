Subject:      european headlights

was just perusing some catalogs and the new dimensions catalog
(www.newdimensions_dot_com ) lists hella h-4 headlights in a 7x6 size.
this should fit the late model vanagons.

part no. 716.94.114  hella h-4  _at_ $42.00 each
part no. 716.94.104  hella &quot;vision plus&quot;  _at_ $44.95 each ( these use
the same bulb and socket as stock,  i think,  thus eliminating the
need to graft new connectors on to the harness for the h-4 bulbs )
part no. 716.94.110  city light kit  _at_ $31.95  ( this will incorporate
city lights into the above h-4 headlights...connected to the parking
light circuit )

i have used the hella lights on other cars and the beam pattern is
impressive.....lots of light with a distinct cut off.
i have no connection with this company,  wrong coast,  but they have
always been helpful in the past

cheers,
jim catterson
