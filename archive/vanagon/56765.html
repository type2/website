Subject: Re: Kroil

Ron, the stuff you're referring to is probably called Aero-Kroil and is
made by Kano Laboratories.  I've always seen it in an orange colored
spray can.  I've used it for years as a super penetrating oil for just
the sort of situations that you describe.  Its every bit as good as you
say.  I used to have access to it through my work, but that is no longer
the case.  I've wondered what I'll do when my supply finally runs out! 
If you actually find a commercial source for this stuff, it would
probably be worth a post to the list.
