OK Volks - here's the &quot;skinny&quot; on what you have been looking for.  First
of all, it's been discontinued, at least at the dealers on the North
American Continent (I checked with my contact at VOA in Troy, MI), so it
may be available still in Europe.

P/N 025-905-209A  Screening Ring (is what it's called in the fiche).
Boot looks really funky in the fiche diagram.

The coil also used one of these as well - P/N 251-905-209 (Also
discontinued)

Fiche indicates these were installed on Syncros with &quot;Extended
Suppression&quot;

&gt;Hi There.  I've owned our '90 Syncro since new, and all I know is
&gt;that there is a black bag that fits over the distributor cap and
&gt;ignition wires at the cap.  It deteriorates over time with heat.
&gt;It's about $30 CDN to replace... so I haven't replaced it.
&gt;
&gt;VW also sealed around the bell housing with big gobs of silicone
&gt;sealer.
&gt;
&gt;That's all I've noticed.

&gt;&gt;     Does anyone know if the Syncro had anything extra done to the
&gt;ignition
&gt;&gt;     to water proof it? I figure if VW took the trouble with the
