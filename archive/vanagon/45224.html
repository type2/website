Subject: [TRADE] 1988 Westfalia

Alright, that should interest you . . . .

The goal here, gentle reader, is to replace our `88 Westy with an earlier,
CHEAPER version . . . say an `83-`85, plus some cash.  So, if you are looking
to upgrade, consider ours.  We will give you _excellent credit_ on your old,
worn, beaten Westy.  

Contact me and we'll talk numbers.  I'd like to keep this vehicle in the
family, so to speak.  

No trade is too absurd, incidentally.
