Subject: electronic ignition?

Hey all,
I was under the impression that all Vanagons came with Hall effect
electronic ignition stuff but poking around the engine compartment on my
'81 revealed a regular ol' points and condenser setup.  Was it just
California Vanagons that had Hall effect stuff or has mine been
converted?  BTW, there is a mysterious black box that sits on the left
side of the engine compartment, right in the stream of air from the left
side air scoop.  It's a Bosch electrical part that has at least one
connection to the coil, question is, what the heck is it?  It's not the
ECU, that's on the other side.  

Hmm, I haven't had to worry about points for a while.  My '78 had
breakerless ignition.

Sean
