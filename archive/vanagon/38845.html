The obsessive part is repeated mental actions.
The compulsive part is repeated physical actions

Just clearing things up :)

&gt; i thought this list determined that &quot;Obsessive/Compulsive&quot; was the

&gt; incorrect term when the correct term is available, can we?  That's 
&gt; what's wrong with society nowadays, we settle for the mediocre and 
&gt; 'pretty good'.  Where has exactness gone?  Orderliness?  Linear 
&gt; concrete thinking?  I mean I'm not being obsessive about this am I?  
&gt; Or is it compulsive?
