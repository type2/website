&gt;  Thank you to all who gave suggestions on wheel bearing sources.  I
&gt;still need to pull the bearings and get a number.  I think I am going to get
&gt;them from a local bearing distributor.  When I get the numbers  I will post
&gt;them with the numbers and price of the new part.

These bearings are available from Beck Arnley.  About $60.00.  I forgot to
get the number for you.  Sorry.

Dennis.
