Subject:      query:rust, what's to much


looking at a 79 van (station wagon).  the last owner seemed to fiber
glass all the rusted out spots. step down by the driver
sliding door, driver feet, batttery floor, and the main floor.
adjacent to tracks slight rust under dry rotted window seals, .......

get the picture,

i thought cause the wheel wells roof and sides were solid,
the van would score better, after closer examination, which it
failed. (weird how the wheel wells look really good but other
spots did not)

the same guy bought the van in
sept 94, for $1500, wow. now he wants $600 and says the motors good,
he's punishing his kid.

and now the query!!!
how much rust is to much rust?
better to burn out?
