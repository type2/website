Subject: Re: Warm buses

&gt; My uncle, a VW/snowmobile {!} mechanic shared his setup with me. He 
&gt;likes to camp in Montana in the winter, so he obtained the smallest 
&gt;propane furnace meant for a motorhome. Cut carved and plumbed it into the 
&gt;divider between the driver's seat. Intake and output were sent outside 
&gt;the bus. Themostatic heat! Claims it makes snow camping comfortable..If 
&gt;anyone wants more details, I'll contact him. Might be a little overkill 
&gt;for CA, but on the right night........

    I'd be EXTREMELY interested in his choices. Are you talking 
    about this guy having somehow integrated a kind of oil-filled
    indoor radiator into the FRAME of his VW??

&gt;&quot;Man has always considered himself superior to animals, a presumption not 
&gt;always supported by the facts&quot; J.Muir
