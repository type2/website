Yes, I use a non-VW rotor and cap (some after-market thing). Also, I am
in a very dry climate. But I think that the cap does not fit as snugly as
it should, so probably &quot;dirt&quot; and some moisture could have gotten in
anyway. One more thing, are the contacts in the cap supposed to be
&quot;scratched&quot; very noticeably by the rotor's metal blade?
