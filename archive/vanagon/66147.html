Subject:      Re: Rubber meets the metal

When I used to build balsa model airplanes, (the ones with a rubber band
and prop)  I treated the rubber with a mixture of glycerin and talcum.
This mixture kept the rubber from hardening and sticking to itself and
potentially breaking.

I do not remember the exact mixture, but I wonder if this would also be a
viable solution to the rubber meets metal problem.
