Subject: Vanagon 5 speed

'Evening All,
    Anyone out there know anything about a 5 speed trans. put into Canadian
'84 gas Vanagons. I have a chance to buy one that I plan to put into my '82
Westy diesel. My specific question is, are there any known problems with the
design? Also, if it can take the torque of a 1.9L TDI diesel as opposed to a
1.9L gas motor.  Any ideas?

Bob Bellanca
