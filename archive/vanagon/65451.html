Subject:      Noisy AC Saga continues.*HELP*

Thanks to Dennis Haynes, Kenneth D. Lewis and Justin Jensen for the great
advice! I went the VW service place to discuss your suggestions and after
further discussion I discovered that neither of the mechanics have
actually had to do a major repair on a Vanagon AC system. I am going to
meet the mechanic and an outside AC guy this morning to try and solve
this thing. The noise in the system seems to be coming from up front so I
would like start our search there. Problem is, my mechanical crew seem
quite gung ho to rip out the evaporator and expansion valve and then
progress to the air dryer but I would be more inclined to have a look up
front. I am thinking that it might be a good Idea to bypass these systems
one at a time till we find the culprit. Any Ideas??
