Subject: Re: still fi problems!!

Ben is gnashing his teeth because his '77 2 ltr won't stay alive. Just a
hunch, but check the lead from the coil to the oil pressure sending unit. 
This wire crosses over the distributor cap and tends to get in the way of
inspecting the points. Anyway, this bad connection caused my '77 to die, 
might as well check to be sure ALL connections are secure and clean.

good luck...think simple!
