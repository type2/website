Subject: Re:  Tygon tubing



&gt;
&gt;oh yeah that was me - i didnt worry too much gas-tygon compat. because i
&gt;aint got no steeking gas - its an oil burner Vanagon !!
&gt;
&gt;fuel oil- tygon is cool - wouldnt use it with gasoline though - just like
&gt;the chart says ...
&gt;
&gt;actually the lines dont see much in the way of fuel - only when the beast is
&gt;tipped one way or the other. Still, after all the work of dropping the tank
&gt;i wouldnt want to kill the job by cheaping out on the wrong hoses ...
&gt;
&gt;thanks for note alistair - gassers heed this advice.
&gt;
&gt;
	At the risk of &quot;fueling&quot; more paranoia, the compatability
	chart also recommended against kerosene and Tygon.
	No listing for diesel...


	I hate when this happens
