&gt; &gt;1) At this time, the radio is connected to a 4-foot fiberglass antenna
&gt; &gt;attached to the left corner of the front bumper. The cable has about 1
&gt; &gt;foot of slack (in case it needs to be shortened).
&gt; 
&gt; i think this would probably be the most reasonable solution. in fact, you
&gt; could bet a duplicate antenna and put on the RIGHT corner of the front
&gt; bumper, and tell everyone that they (antennas) were those &quot;feeler&quot; rods
&gt; that the big trucks have (to tell where their front bumpers are)!! :)

I would argue for putting the antenna on the roof (making sure it has a
good ground).  As for the second antenna, don't hook it up, because
unless the two antennas are 8 feet apart, you will just hurt your
reception.

&gt; this should work ok, but you'll have to remember that because all the mass
&gt; of the car is behind and to the right of the antenna, that your &quot;best&quot;
&gt; transmitting will go off in that direction (back toward your left rear
&gt; corner).  but for ranges of 2-3 miles or so, it probably won't make any
&gt; difference.
&gt; 
&gt; and the bigger antenna is better, anyway.

It may be bigger, but it is also much lower down.

But don't listen to me, my CB don't work worth a crud.  :)
