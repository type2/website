&gt; A couple of questions: anyone know a good and cheap(ish) source for 
&gt; window rubbers(I need the rear loading door one) that would send to me by 

Go with West Coast Metric, quality can't be beat, price is fair, hell
you might be able to get thenm to send you their new catalog, who knows?

&gt; mail? Secondly, what is the most economical and reliable way to get more 
&gt; cruising speed from the van? I have a 1600 engine, totally stock. 
&gt; Reliability is more important to me than getting the most speed, but the 
&gt; roads here are long and srtaight....90km/h gets a bit boring. Any 
&gt; suggestions welcome.

Drive if off a cliff, sorry old VW joke but I've been feeling recently
the same thing about my '71 jeez I miss my '76, the 1776 should be a
pretty reliable upgrade from a quality builder but I've decided to live
with 55 or 60 mph or so until she finally blows on her own accord.
