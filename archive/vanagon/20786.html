Subject: Vehicle names

I have a '78 bus painted &quot;Panama Brown&quot; (orangish) and &quot;Dakota Beige&quot; up 
top.  For a while after buying it in 1980, I called it &quot;Pumpkin&quot; or 
&quot;Butternut,&quot; but neither name really stuck.

I had the bus in Mexico for several months in 1983-84, and my Mexican 
friends referred to my van as a Kombi -- the first time I'd heard that 
designation.  Soon, we started calling it &quot;Kombita,&quot; which, of course, is 
the affectionate Spanish diminutive form.  That's been her (?) name and 
license plate number ever since.  She answers to it, and starts purring 
if you say a few other nice words in Spanish.
