Subject: Re: list sticker

&gt;Evan, I just sent a request to Joel Re: the sticker...he replied that they
&gt;were produced by Richard Palmer. Maybe if we get an order together he may be
&gt;interested in making some more????????????Hint hint.

Count me in on a new batch of stickers.In fact I'll take
two,the're small.Anyone else?
