Subject: paints???


 looking for a recommendation for paint...
 anyone have experience with any good spray paints
 which last and are good rust fighters...
 i have yet to find one..
 i cannot afford to repaint my transporter now, but until i can
 i want to spray paint some areas that are in danger of rusting...
 i know rustoleum sucks, so short of buying a pro spray rig
 and all that goes with it, does any one know of a good
 spray primer and paint to help keep metal safe???
