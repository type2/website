MI&gt;Subject: For What Its Worth...


MI&gt;On a lighter note:

MI&gt;A friend and I went over to the neighbors house to check out and
MI&gt;possibly purchase that Ghia I'd mentioned a week or so back.  In all
MI&gt;honesty I estimate it was worth about $1500-$1900.  Little rust here
MI&gt;and there, missing some chrome and a couple dents, but overall in
MI&gt;good shape (with a new rebuilt 1600).  As I said this neighbor would
MI&gt;not say how much he wanted or even expected for it.  He wanted us to
MI&gt;make an offer first, and of course if we were going to offer way over
MI&gt;what he wanted he'd take it.  Good for him huh!?

MI&gt;So Rich offers him $900 for it.  That's about what Rich has so spend,
MI&gt;&quot;Oh, (heh), I can't take anything less than $3500 for it.&quot;
MI&gt;I laugh out loud, and Rich chuckles.
MI&gt;&quot;Well we spent $1500 on the engine, and when this is restored it will
MI&gt;be worth $10,000.&quot;

Sounds like a dreamer!

MI&gt;I proceeded to tell him that in Provo (20 minutes away) there is a
MI&gt;fully restored Ghia with redone interior, whole shooting match for
MI&gt;$3500.

MI&gt;I realized that was really a stupid thing to say as the words came
MI&gt;out my mouth, and he said &quot;Well go buy that one then!&quot;

My experience is to say, &quot;Sorry dude, you'll be sitting on it then&quot;.
I had a similar experience with a nasty old guy and a '78 Champagne
Edition Bus (I had the same but it was a rust bucket). I saw the ad in
VWT with a picture and it looked nice. I contacted the old geezer and he
said price was &quot;negotionable&quot;. So my buddy and I drove 6 hours to Cincy
to see it.
It was a nice Bus, real nice in fact. But the old guy kept pushing and
pushing. Finally I told him to back off, I have an identical Bus at home
and you can't tell me anything I don't know.
I took it for a ride and it was just gorgeous. A little squeal in the
brakes but no big deal. It was really kept up on the maintenence, but
the old guy considered that as &quot;restoration&quot;.
So it came to offer time and I had $2500 in my head as the real worth.
So I figure I'd say $1500 and work from there. Hey, even if it was
$2500, I'd take it.
SO I told the old man I had a number in my head, what do you want for
it? He tells me he had an offer for $5000 from some guys 2 hours away.
And they'd come back. Now, if I'd like to top that....
Needless to say, I was really pissed! Trying to whipsaw me with an
imaginary buyer. I told him see ya then, good luck. He look dejected but
kept insisting it was &quot;vintage&quot; and &quot;classic&quot;. I told him to quit BSing
me. It's got a few years to go to be considered classic. So I gave him
my phone number and told him to call ME when he's ready to deal. He
pouted at me and said maybe I can call him in a few days in case them
$5000 guys don't return. I insisted, no. You call me.
I was bummed because I really wanted the Bus, but I wasn't going to be
BSed or pay twice it's worth. I guess when you deal with unknowledgeable
jerks that own VWs you can expect that.
The good news is I did find another decent Bus. Things always work out.
