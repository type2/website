&gt;I live in southeastern PA and I have recently purchased an 83.5 Westfalia. 
&gt; My 
&gt;question is, sometimes I see Westy's with &quot;House Car&quot; tags here in PA, or 
&gt;with 
&gt;&quot;Mobile Home&quot;, etc. on Westy's from other states.  My van just has regular 
&gt;tags.  What is the pre-requisite for these tags?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Bryan
In PA, you have several kinds of tags. 
Many Westies were originally bought or brought into PA as &quot;station 
wagons&quot; with regular plates. This is incorrect.
A Westy should be registered as a motor home, with motor home plates. You 
can go to AAA or the DMV (PennDOT, wherever they put their offices now 
that their old building is condemned in Harrisburg) and get the form to 
correct this. I don't know the form name or number, but I've done this 
for one of my vans. They will likely give you dirty looks, as if you have 
perpetrated a vicious scam on them in collusion with all the previous 
owners.
You will likely have to take pictures of the Westy to prove it has a 
poptop and stove/sink, etc. I did.
Your registration fee will go up 5 bucks per year. I've heard that you're 
exempt from PA's open container law for alcohol in a motor home, though 
(but this is not verified).
The new plate will say Motor Home on it. The House Car plate was used in 
the '80s, and was discontinued in 1989. You can't get them now. I using 
my old one for my van next year, though, when I move it from my wife's 
and my name into my name alone. (I like a plate that says &quot;House Car&quot;).
Any questions?
