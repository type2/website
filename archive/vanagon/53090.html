Subject: Re: Safe highway speeds

&gt;&gt; I have recently purchased a 1979 Westfalia with the 2.0 liter motor 
&gt;&gt; and a manual transmission.  Becasue there is no tach, I have no idea 
&gt;&gt; what a safe, long trip highway speed is.  Can I cruise at 65 with no 
&gt;&gt; worries?  Can I go faster (downhill with a tail wind :) )?  Please let 

&gt;As I understand it, in air-cooled engine's, increased speed equals
&gt;increased heat equals damaged valves.  All literature I have read saya
&gt;stay at or below 65mph.



I often drove my '78 2.0l at 70-75mph on lonnnng trips, 10-12hrs. straight.
Ran happily. Did the same in my '72 1.7l.  Just use 20W50!!!  Gas mileage
_really_ suffers over 60-65mph though.   tim
