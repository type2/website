Subject: we got the '89...

...but we didn't get to take him home.

The dealer let us drive him over the weekend, until we could go in and
close the deal (with the title to our trade-in-Toyota).  On the way to the
dealer (from home, with the kids) the A/C first turned warm, then the
blower quit.  Smelled bad too.

They're paying for the fix (maintenance contract won't go into effect for
30 days).

They loaned us a verrry nice '94 Passat GLX (VR6) to tide us over.  Does
that thing ever zooom!  And the Eurovan will have that engine next year?
We may have to get one...
