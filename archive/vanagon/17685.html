Subject: windshield seal question
Date: Tue, 16 May 95 18:02:58 CDT


	Hi ,
		all this talk about the area under the windshield
		rusting away has got me to notice that the same
		thing is happening up front in mine. I want to
		seal up the cabin .. i always get a puddle up there
		after a rain storm, this then drains out the hole
		in my floor pan !

		my question is, i remember someone posting a good
		summary of the procedure to remove front windshield
		and reinstall with new rubber. could someone repost 
		this ? Also has anyone had success repairing holes 
		in their floor pan up front . Its softball size
		and it is staring to grow towards the passenger seat .
		   
			thanks for the help,	guntram
