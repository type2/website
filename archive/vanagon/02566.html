Guntram, I am your man.  I live in Lincoln, Nebraska AND I know more 
about the Fort Collins, Estes Park areas than most.  I could set you 
up at my place or show you some cool places to camp right off the 
interstate.  As for driving up to Estes, I haven't driven a bus up 
there but the road up through Loveland and Big Thompson Canyon is not 
terribly steep.  Estes only sets at 7,600 ft.  Estes is filled with 
places to camp, I would think you could find one spot.  Try the 
Chamber of Commerce, they might be able to point you to someone to 
make reservations.  Finally, don't stop in Estes without eating at La 
Casa.  A kinda crazy place near the east end of the main drag that 
serves Mexican and Cajun.  Also, they have Margaritas ON TAP.  Don't 
try to drive away from this place.  E-mail me privately and I could 
tell you more about Lincoln, Fort Collins, Estes, etc.  Jim
