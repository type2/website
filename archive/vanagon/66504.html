Subject:      Re: OH NO!!- Fuel gauge stuck at Full

eric et al:  the gas gauge on my '82 vanagon drops to half full and
stays there until i fill-up again, when it returns to full and we start
over again.  unfortunately, i ran out of gas the first time this
happened (and now use the trip meter to keep track of fuel needs).
anyway, fillups don't resolve this, and i'm not sure what will so just
living with it for now.  cheers...

&gt;
&gt;    Next time you fill the tank up it will unstick itself. This has
&gt;    happened  to me 2 times now after I have been off road.

&gt; &gt;      My trusty Westy Syncro developed one of its first problems.  After
&gt; &gt;      filling up with gas in Hayward, Wisconsin (slow fill) on Sunday and
&gt; &gt;      driving for 100 miles back home the fuel gauge stayed at full.  When I
&gt; &gt;      turn the Westy off the gauge does drop to Empty.  After restarting,
&gt; &gt;      the gauge goes to full.  I know that my Westy Syncro has been a
&gt; &gt;      constant 20 m.p.g. vehicle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      I haven't had the time (have to work on Monday) to check it out.  Has
&gt; &gt;      any one had this problem?  I'm going home after work Monday to look
&gt; &gt;      this over, any words of wisdom would be appreciated.
