Subject: horizontally opposed redline

You need to discriminate between noncounterweighted HO engines, like VW,
and counterweighted HO engines, like Porsche.  For the VW engines, 4000rpm,
or right around 70 for a lot of our buses, is where my ears are calibrated
if I'm not watching the tach.

The Porsche engine doesn't give the sense that it is straining until far
above that, and power continues to build until 5500 or more, or at least
it feels like it does.

Any listmembers able to comment, before-and-after-wise, on a VW engine that
got an aftermarket counterweighted crank?
