Todd -

There were two main suppliers to Volkswagen were Reinz and Elring, both
out of Germany and both of which also supply Head gasket sets on the
aftermarket.  Personal preference are the Reinz made sets (they're in a
blue package) because they came with the sealing compounds mentioned in
Bentley in the appropriate tubes.  Elring's sets do not..

&gt;Hi all:  I was wondreing if anyone knows if the Head gasket kits for
&gt;Wasserboxers that you get from aftermarket sources are built by the 
&gt;same
&gt;manufacturer as the kit that you get from the VW dealer? Is there only
&gt;one manufacturer of head gasket kits for these engines?
