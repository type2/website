Subject: 1400--1600 rpm in '85 Vanagon
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 20:12:11 -0800 (PST)

I got the Bentley manual and lo and behold there is an idle adjusting 
screw!  I had assumed that since the idle was digitally stabilized that 
it would not be adjustable.  I have since trurned the screw a couple of 
full turns counter-clockwise and the idle is back to spec.

I figured that the next thing would be that it would not idle at 
start-up.  So far no problem.  Now it hasn't really gotten very cold down 
here (Atlanta) yet so I may have some cold start problems or rough idle 
on warm up when it does but right now it seems to be working fine.

I did notice something on cold start that my Jetta used to do (also an 
'85 model) the OXS and Alternator LED lights do not go out until you rev 
the engine above 1000rpm, something I have always heard is not a problem 
and has been corrected in later models.

I do plan on changing out the O2 sensor and changing the oil and coolant 
when I get back from vacation over Thanksgiving.  The coolant is, of 
course, bright green.  I just hope I can find all those bleeding screws 
and get enough coolant in without the air pockets.  Will be reading the 
manual and the FAQ carefully.

The only other problems I'm having are with the starter solenoid, 
occasionally it is not engaging the starter and the front end squeaks a 
bit and I here this when manoevering into parking spaces--this seems to 
be coming from the steering.

BTW, the mileage isn't as bad as I thought it would be--getting around 
17mpg in town with some freeway driving.  Looks like I'll just have to 
get used to that, the Passat gets around 24 in town and 35 on the 
highway.  I suppose I expected a little better out of the Vanagon.--
