&gt; Now that you are off your rant, how about a story by a thoroughly
&gt; pleased EV owner.

Snips
&gt; My only major complaint about the EV is that VWUS screwed up in its
&gt; marketing effort, or lack thereof for the EV. There are TONS of T4s
&gt; in Europe....the line there includes single cab, double cab pick up
&gt; trucks, delivery vans, passenger vans, etc...4 cyl, 5 cyl gas...4 &amp; 5
&gt; cylinder diesels (some now with turbos)....from what I saw over
&gt; there they are bullet proof workhorses.
&gt;
&gt; I would rather have a van that is still built on a ladder type chassis than
&gt; the uni-shit-box construction of a Caravan, etc. I have a neighbor who
&gt; bought one of those Carashitboxes about the same time we bought the EV..
&gt; we have more miles on ours...his squeaks...minor trim pieces are
&gt; loose...ours is still solid!

I agree!  Your letter is a real inspiration.  I dread going to one of those
american Depot Hacks.  Heck, even my 67 with 375K miles on it had fewer
rattles than a Mopar Mini I rented on travel once that still had the
factory stickers in the window!  And the bus's rattles were ALL due to
shrunken and hardened weatherstripping.

&gt; BTW we blew his (our neighbor) mind this weekend...bought a new kitchen
&gt; set (table and 6 chairs) still in their packing boxes...not a problem
&gt; pop down the rear seat...slide in the box with the table (30 x 60 x 8),
&gt; and three boxes containing the chairs (24 x 24 x 36). Still had room
&gt; to seat the (now) 3 year old kid in the remaining jump seat in the back...

I did that very same thing with an antique rosewood dining room set just
after I bought the EV.  Just put the fully assembled table in upside down
on the folded seats, and the six chairs in and around it!  Also easiest
vehicle to load plywood and 12&quot; boards in.  Other vans &quot;designed around the
4X8 sheet of plywood&quot; have to have the seats removed - pain in the beautox.

I'm cooling down quite a bit about the problems with my van.  I think I
will have to educate the dealer mechanics after all.  But I'll have to get
a Bently for the thing and trace down the electrical system myself.  BIG
JOB.  BUT, based on what I spent and what I owe, even if I WANTED a Mopar
Mini or Jellybean, I'd bump my monthly payments up by quite a bit
(currently running a 6-year loan with the credit union for about $315/mo).
Now, if the VR-6 is that bitchen, and they do bring the EV back...
