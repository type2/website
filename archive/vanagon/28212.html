Hello all,

Saturday I re-wired my horn and tested it by touching the wire coming
through the steering column to some metal on the steering column. It
worked great! But when I put the horn button on and depressed it nothing
happened. No beep,beep!  Well, I decided to touch the wire to anything
that looked metal in the horn button. No beep, beep.  What is suppose to
happen(in detail) when the horn button is depressed?  What is the wire
supposed to ground to inside the horn button?(this probably answers my
previous question!)

Also, my bus has started to backfire some.  What causes a backfire?

Any responses would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

***
