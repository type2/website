Subject: Just how cold should that fridge get?
Date: Sun, 30 Jun 96 14:17:59 -0500

Thanks to everybody who replied via email re: my leaky fuel line post!

We went on a little trip this weekend to Lanesborough, Minnesota, and foudn that
our fridge never really got as cold as we expected it to. Is this owing to the 
increadibly hot weather we had on Friday and Saturday? That is, is it only able 
to get temps 30-40 degrees below ambient temp? Our beer stayed _pretty_ cool, 
but not as cold as the home fridge would have kept it, and we never got ice to 
form in the cute little ice tray--should this have happened, despite 90-95 temps
during the day?

Thanks,

Steve
