Pavneet,

My '84 GL came with two tire/pressure recommendations.  Indeed, the light 
truck tire recommendation has the 48 psi (rear) specification that you 
referred to.  However, VW also recommended the reinforced passenger tire 
with an inflation pressure of 40 psi.

My Vanagon came with Michelin light truck tires and I was never very happy 
about the handling.  I replaced the original Michelin with Bridgstone light 
truck tires and the handling got worse.  So, I tried Michelin reinforced 
tires (at the recommended 40 psi), and things got much better.

My specific complaints about the light truck tires were road noise, rough 
ride, and most importantly, skidding on wet pavement.

Subjectively, I feel that the reinforced tires are more precise in handling 
as well.

&gt;From reading this list, it seems that the reinforced tires are hard to 
find.  However, I like them so much better, that I will spend the time to 
find them when the time comes.

Mike
