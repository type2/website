&gt;The VW mechanic I take by Golf and Vanagon to strongly recommends repacking
&gt;all CV joints every 30,000 miles, especially for the Vanagon.  He claims the
&gt;joints will last almost indefinitely when maintained at this interval,
&gt;providing a boot does not tear in the interim.

sounds good to me. that fits right in with the two-year cycle of replacing
all the fluids. but why does he say 'especially for the Vanagon'?? why not
all buses? Inquiring Minds want to know! ;)
