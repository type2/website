Subject: Revised Camping List

Hey all!

Well, the camping list has grown by a couple more folks since the other
day.  As it stands now:

Me (of course)
John Anderson
Steven Dolan
Robert Busick (he's indicated that he have a couple other folks w/ him)
David Higgenbotham (of NC.  Also indicated that he will be bringing two
other couples)

So it looks like we may have a good turnout after all.  

Tom Forhan is still a maybe.

Anyone else?  It's gonna be fun.... :-)

Sean
