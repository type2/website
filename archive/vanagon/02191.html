Subject: a few ads ..

&gt;86 VW Synchro
&gt;4WD, 7-pass, fact rear bed, PS&amp;PB, AC, p/mirrors, no rust, 106k mi, minor
&gt;dents, nds new heads. Runs strong. Can be heard run in Hopkinton $2500/bo
&gt;call eves (Franklin) 508-541-8393

I've converted from a Eurovan-wannabe to a Vanagon-wannabe and this
ad sounds like what I'm looking for.  Are all Synchro's manual transmission
(I hope its not an automatic)?
What size engine is this?  What would it cost (guestimate) for new heads?
(I have neither the time, skill, or desire to do this myself)  What would
it cost to go the extra nine yards and do a comprehensive engine rebuild,
since the engine would, presumably, already be apart?  It would be nice to
have a completely rebuilt engine from the start.  Is this a full time
4WD?  What sort of gas mileage would it get?

I'm a not-very-mechanical vanagon-newbie (except for a '69 bus I owned a loong
time ago).  What should I look for if I go to see this vehicle?  106k sounds
like a lot of miles for a 4WD -- do the synchro's tranny hold up well?
Thanks for any help.
