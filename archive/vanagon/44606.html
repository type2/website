Subject: Followup - stranded in L.A.

Found one of the plug wires (at the plug side) loose.  It was the one
that is most accessible - lower right as you look from in from the
rear.  It's also missing the plastic/rubber seal which seats into the
sheet metal heat plate.  This is probably the one the mechanic used
to check for spark.  Cranked right up.  So I don't have to throw it away
now.!  Yeah.  So plenty of future problems to deal w/ down the road.
Thanks all for the tips.
