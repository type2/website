Subject: More on Westy Interior changes, '68-'72

I have a real treasure: and official Campmobile Parts Catalog for 
'68-'72, with exploded drawings of _every_ Westy-specific part.  
AHAHAHAHA snurk! snurk! ... excuse me.  But it _is_ a completist's wet dream.

Anyhoo, some notable changes (doing this sans book, now):

The rear overhead cargo net became an open-fronted cabinet around '70.  
No changes to clothes cabinet or rear seat in that period.  Jumpseat 
(behind driver) saw minor changes.  About '71 the sink got a vent pipe.  
Somewhere about 70=71 the sink became stainless (was plastic).  The 
brace for the sink lid (when open) was eliminated in favor of offset 
hinges.  About the same time the knife drawer was discontinued in favor of a 
drop-down door into the entire undersink area.  Minor changes to the 
racks in the cooler.  The outside socket went through several versions.  
The poptop and folding cot remained unchanged.

IMHO the most difficult parts to find for this series:
-Faucet that works (and hasn't lost its discharge pipe)
-Uncracked plastic sink
-Table that latches properly in the stored position.
-Hammock, if it was misplaced -- especially the blue end-cover.
-Stool, with leather strap for attaching to side of sink cabinet.
-Cooler trays.
-plastic trim that encircles sunroof cutout in bus body

The book includes all part numbers, inluding those for the tent.  Nice 
sketches. No, you can't have it, it's mine.  Happy to provide details &amp; 
P/Ns on request -- this would be KILLER if it was for pre-67's.

God, I have simple tastes.

Jose

PS I like the Westy book idea -- I've already written most of the tent 
chapter (plug, plug -- see .sig :-).  I confess my faves are pre-74, though 
the newer ones certainly are more _civilized_, a fact I grow increasingly 
appreciative of as I age, gracelessly.
