Subject: Re: Blizzaks on the EV 

I strongly recommend that if you run standard load tires, such as Blizzaks, on your vans, 
inflate the tires to the maximum pressure listed on the sidewalls.

This will allow the tires to more easily support the load and to run at lower temperatures.

&gt;Hal,
&gt;
&gt;To answer your question on why I felt comfortable in putting non-Reinforced 
&gt;tires (namely the Blizzaks) on my EV, here's why:
&gt;
&gt;1. According to the stuff on the sidewall, the rating for the tires is 1550 
&gt;lbs. The front axle load is approx 2800 lbs, and the rear load is 2200 lbs., 
&gt;therefore there is an approx. 300 lb load margin with the Blizzaks.
&gt;
&gt;2. The majority of my driving during the winter using the EV is usually 
&gt;short hops...&lt;25 miles....as opposed to lots of long trips during the 
&gt;summer. When I need to do long distance driving during the winter, the 
&gt;Outback gets the nod.
&gt;
&gt;Based on 1 &amp; 2 above, I felt comfortable with the Blizzaks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As to the availability, I got mine from the local Firestone dealer. BTW 
&gt;Firestone has a deal whereby if you buy either a pair or a set of Blizzaks, 
&gt;they will change them over back to your summer tires w/a balance...change 
&gt;your summers over to Blizzaks w/balancing for the next four years free of 
&gt;charge.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hope this answers your questions.
&gt;
&gt;Ric
