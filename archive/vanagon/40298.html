Subject: Frozen parking Brake

I realize this was covered a short while ago but I now have the problem.

My '77 westy has been sitting (with the parking brake on) since December 
in cold and wet western NY.  The Parking brake is locked athough the
brake handle seems to release.  What is the best approach to take to fix
this problem.
Thanks once again,
Brett
