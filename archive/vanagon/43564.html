&gt;
&gt;1. Gas guage: When it read 1/2 how many gallons are left? Is the 1/2
&gt;based on the total volume of the gas tank (21 gallons, right?) or does
&gt;it not include the red-zone reserve of 2? gallons??
&gt;

While I don't recall exact numbers, I do recall being surprised that it
didn't take more gas when it was at halfway mark.

&gt;2. Engine Oil dipstick: when the oil is down to the end of the crossed
&gt;section is it one quart low or more than one quart??
&gt;

It's one quart low at the bottom.
