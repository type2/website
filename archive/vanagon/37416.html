Subject:  re: Chirping 

&gt;the bus has been resting, but the weather is warming.  within
&gt;two weeks i will be swapping motors in my 81(california version), due to
&gt;an as-yet unidentified intermittent-but-mostly-present tweedling/chirping
&gt;sound (on revving/acceleration, and sometimes a constant slow chirp at
&gt;idle) and the availability of a low-cost replacement motor. i wouldn't mind
&gt;diagnosing what the chirping is before i remove the engine, so i can
&gt;fix/rebuild later at leisure.  any ideas?

I was once told by an old VW mechanic not to buy any Volks that
didn't have a bird in it. He had me listen to a 'good bug', and a 'bad bug'
The good one had the &quot;bird&quot; chirping sound in the exhaust note.
The bad one didn't. He said if it has a bird it will run forever. If it
doesn't don't buy it as it is not long for the world?
Comments?
