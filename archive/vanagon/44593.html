Subject: SOTO/Classic Weekend (Part 3 Camping with Box on Wheels)

OK, so the SOTO meet was complete, all of the door prizes were handed out,
everyone had the requisite stare at the Parts is Parts &quot;bolt-on&quot; lady, and
Dave Heard's reputation remained in the &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; category ;-)
Some of the crowd would run back over to the Irvine Hiliday Inn for the Toy
and Literature show. I like my toys at a 1:1 scale. Usually, the best show
is in the parking lot and in the bar. This year the bro-in-law and I decided
to meet up with the SanDiego NEATO chapter called &quot;The Box On Wheels Club.&quot; 
We wandered up to O'Neil Park which is in the hills south of Irvine. LA is
weird in that you can be in Compton getting car jacked and shot at or drive
45 minutes and camp out &quot;in the woods.&quot; The park was a nice &quot;forested&quot; camp
area with pre-designated parking spots. We were the first to arrive. The
lady at the gate said to camp anywhere in areas A,B, or C. Cool! We were to
have the pick of the spots! =) The downside was the we couldn't find areas
A,B, or C and opted for space # 71. Popped the top on the camper and some
liquid, burnt some weinie samitches and rested. No buses arrived. Hmmm... A
couple of hours later a nice lady sheepishly approached us as we were
serinated by soothing bands like the Henry Rollins Orchestra, Rage Against
the Machine, and NIN. She mentioned that the Girl Scout Troop #69 was to
arrive and that we were in her spot. She also mentioned that a zillion old
hippie buses were parked down in the really nice grassy area. She pointed
down the road and thought that we would be more comfy with them. Yup, in
fact. So we moved.
Sliding into the A,B, and C area was nearly impossible as all of the spaces
were already taken. We had to either squeeze into the spot where everyone
would scuff by in the gravel to and from the shower house with banging door
or park &quot;over there.&quot; The bro-in-law suggested that &quot;over there&quot; would be
quieter. So we moved. Compliments to Daniel Lewis and crew for organizing a
great option to the Holiday Inn parking lot. Unfortunately, the VanBondo
tribe may have come across as antisocial by parking &quot;over there.&quot; 
Our neighbors, &quot;over there,&quot;  as announced by a huge banner were a group of
&quot;Emotionally Tweeked Viet Vet Postal Workers with Trigger Fingers for
Christ.&quot; I got major looks as I scooted the Westy into their area. Jesus
Christ and Viet Vets get my support. Trigger fingers kinda make me feel
uneasy. Uh, we moved a leeetle further away and popped the top again. We
wanted to get a good night sleep.
Appropriate sniffing of the San Diego Buses, visiting, beanie weenies, and
time to crash! Ah, sleep. About 10:30PM all heck broke loose as a half dozen
bugs and buses BOOMED into the spaces right next to us. The Bad Boys from
Azuza, California all had black-lowered vehicles, tight sounding engines
(constantly revving), and BIG BOOMY stereos. (Nice!) These guys must have
had Rexall treats up their noses because they drank, talked, and BOOMED
**ALL** night long. &quot;Wus zup!?, Wus zup!? Sheet Holmes, Wuz zup?!&quot; Uh, like
me all night long~Thank you very little!! 8((.  About 05:00 as in the
prediscussed Five (freekin) Oh clock they started screaming &quot;Wake the ****
UP! Hey everybody Wake the **** UP!&quot; They all jumped in their BOOMY
vehicles, revved the engines, peeled out one by one like jets off an
aircraft carrier, throwing dirt and rocks behind them, and left their camp
fire for the winds to spread into the hills. (Really). VanBondo put out the
fire and suffered more stares from the &quot;Emotionally Tweeked Viet Vet Postal
Workers with Trigger Fingers for Christ.&quot; Guilty by association/proximity.
Those darned VW folks you know... It was now Sunday morning after all. Time
for worship and the VW Classic. Two separate issues in some minds, single in
others.
Casual (non-hyper/exhausted) cup of coffee and off to the Classic. A quick
check of the Box on Wheels crew confirmed that it was quiet and peaceful
&quot;Over there&quot; in areas A,B, and C. The bro-in-law was passed out to the point
that he didn't hear much. Damn, sobriety is a b**** sometimes... Off we went
to the Classic for a day of fun in the sun.
