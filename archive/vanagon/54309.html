     Hello All!
     
     I made it to Portland unscathed.  Thanks to all who offered contacts 
     along the way if I needed help.  I do appreciate it, and I'm grateful 
     that I did not need to call anyone.
     
     Joel please move that '87 Westfalia from Raleigh, NC to Northwest 
     Portland, Oregon.
