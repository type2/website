Here are my $.02 worth -

&gt; Dual airbags added

Still dubious on the value of airbags vs a properly worn seat belt.
(probably start a flame war on that statement)


&gt; Automatic transmission (4-speed) made standard

Never have liked automatic transmissions, still don't.


&gt; Any thoughts on any of these changes???
&gt; 
&gt; Dale (dgoodvin_at_ups_dot_edu)

Still like EV's though.
