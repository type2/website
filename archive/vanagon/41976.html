Subject: Oil Light on 82 Vanagon

The oil light on my 82 Vanagon will not go off., but I am certain
all is well with oil pressure.  One turning on the ignition, the
light glows brightly and when I start the engine it drops to a dull
glow at the time I would expect the lamp to go out.  This isn't
visible during the day, but is at night. 
ANy suggestions please?
Thanks,
