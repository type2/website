&gt;According to the VW South Africa page:

&gt; http://www.vw.co.za/bus/bus_club/tech.html

&gt;you can still buy a Vanagon in SA.  Looks like it's offered with the 4
&gt;and 5 cylinder in-line waterpumpers.

&gt;'Course you'd have a near impossible time getting one into the US, but
&gt;hey, fantasies are just that.

If you really like to import a new SA Vanagon, you may call Mr. Gordon. He
is the export expert of VW SA:

(...)

=============================
Sure, one can easily fall in love with a Vanagon, Microbus, Westie, Crew-Cab 
or whatever. But does it really make sense to spend a tremendous lot of money 
and import a Transporter from Mexico or South-Africa to the US or Europe ? (We 
had his disussion here in Europe some time ago when rumours about ZA syncros 
still in production appered.)

The involuntary retro-design of these exotic busses doesn't derive from a 
historic concious of VW of ZA or Mex. It is the result of customs and tax 
oddities in combination with the idea to use tools which are surplus 
elsewhere. In other terms: You buy technology of the 1970s or 1980s with money 
of the late 1990s - products which are not really competitive on the world 
markets. 

The alternative approach could be to make VW (or any other manufacturers) 
responsables clear that a lot of people want a quite specific sort of car with 
modern technology. If retro-styled or not, maybe another question. 

So, as many people as possible should forward their personal wants directly to 
VW Marketing - VWoA as well as VW Wolfsburg. 

So the slogan is no longer &quot;drivers wanted&quot; but 
&quot;drivers want ...
... Vanagons
... Microbuses
... Crew-Cabs
... Westies
... (16'') syncros
... &quot;

see the previous &quot;VW feedback&quot; mail for communication details
