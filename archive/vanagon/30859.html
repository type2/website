 So why someone singled out the pre 3/55 model to be 'barndoor', i
&gt;dont know.  Oughta be a different name,  INHO


Rusty sez:
INHO?  ;) &quot;Barndoor&quot;  is easier to say that &quot;Large singular top hinging rear
hatch that intergrated what was to become the individualized rear cargo
hatch and the engine deck lid and spans in height from  just above the
bumper line to just below the rain gutter and was produced up to 3/55.&quot;
To old fossils like me we used to hear sayings similar to &quot;it is as big as a
barn door.&quot; People used to be aware of what a barn was and the general size
of a door for such a structure. Folks also used to be less uptight (anal)
about figurative descriptions.  Folks also used to know what Shinola was. It
or it's counter part were not used for lubing speedo cables. Barn door
singles was even more generalized of a description to indicate it's general
production date and features. Not to indicate that 'cabs literally had a
barndoor hatch. I understand that VWAG tried it but realized that there was
nothing to attach it to so they gave up a went with the gate idea as an
after thought. They though it might work better and provide less wind
resistance (drag). They reserved the major wind resistance idea for the '80s
Vanagon crowd. They did major testing of pushing 4' x 8' sheets of plywood
down the Autobahn. The Vanagon has plenty of &quot;drag&quot; on occasion ~ especially
while going up hill with a string of traffic on your tail.  Now THAT's a drag.
