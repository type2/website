&gt;Hi everyone.  My 84 vanagon makes a loud noise when it moves faster than 40
&gt;mph (it's a rolling noise, not a transmission noise).  The noise is
&gt;somewhere between a grind and a hum, and today I noticed a sort of clicking

in all seriousness, it MIGHT be your tires. i had a noise like that which i
could not pin down, and finally asked a friend who runs a tire store. he
asked me if i had radial tires. i said yup, and he told me to rotate them
front to back. it seems that vw vanagons and bmw's have a peculiar front
suspension that causes a strange wear pattern on the little &quot;islands&quot; of the
tire pattern ... the rear of each island wears slightly more than the front
edge. so they start making this &quot;cupping&quot; sort of sound as you drive along.
really wierd sound. anyway, i rotated the tires and about 300 miles later,
the noise was gone.

go figure.
