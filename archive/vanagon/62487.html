Subject: For Sale: 86 Syncro
From: s_j_wacker_at_juno_dot_com (STEVEN G WACKER)

I ran across this 86 Syncro today In north San Diego, Ca. It look like a
VERY well maintained vehicle. Med blue, 99k, power mirrors, Air, AM/FM
Cass. The windows have been nicely tinted and the tires look to be fairly
low milage, there doesn't appear to be any body damage. Inside from what
I could see, is very clean. This is one of the cleanest Syncros I've seen
lately......If only I had the money!! Owner is asking $7500.
If anyone would give this Syncro a good home, call Jim Morgan at
760-599-4771 or e-mail me and I will check out anything you want. I am
free from 8 AM to 12 PM during the week.
