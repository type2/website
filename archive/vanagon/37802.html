Subject: '89 Westie needs mud flaps
Date: Mon, 18 Mar 96 11:28:00 EST


My two week old (to me, anyway) '89 Westie had a rear mud flap crack and 
fall off this weekend.  The other is cracked as well.  Can anyone make any 
recommendations where I can get new ones, other than paying way too much 
from my dealer, of course.  The front ones are also looking a bit worn, so 
perhaps I will replace all four of them.
