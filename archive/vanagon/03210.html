Subject: Florida lemons

Hello to all the vanagon netters!
I work for Hughes Aircraft Co. which is part of GM-Hughes Electronics.
Here's a little snippet from Friday's edition FYI.


This is the GM International Newsline for Friday, August 19, 1994,
 &lt; snip &gt;
GM PERFORMS WELL IN FLORIDA LEMON REVIEW .... The Wall Street Journal
reported Jaguar, Volkswagen and Porsche produce the most lemons,
according to a review of chronic-defect complaints filed with the state
of Florida.  The Florida review -- the most comprehensive analysis of
auto defects in the United States -- says GM's Buick and Oldsmobile
brands have the fewest complaints from consumers, The Journal said.  The
Fla. study is a weighted analysis of 8,500 complaints received by the
state from Jan. 1992 through March 1994.  All are complaints of nagging
defects that arose during the first 24,000 miles of driving a car, The
Journal reported.
 &lt; snip &gt;
This ends the GM International Newsline for Friday, August 19, 1994.


Surely Florida dosen't corner the market in *that* kind of citrus.
Any EuroVan drivers have any horror stories?  Or success stories?
