&gt;The only type of 1600 engine you want to use in a bus is an AE case.  This 
&gt;case has larger oil galleries and a pair of oil pressure relief systems.

The T3 cases which have the said crossmember holes also have dual relief 
galleries as well.
Mine is a UO..... I an sure that there also some T# cases with the single 
relief.

Not intending to pick a fight.
