Thanks for the advice.  I've been fighting this one ever since I got the
Vanagon (never had it with my three bread loaves).  Usually, I listen for
the sound of the thing getting near full and try to back off so that I
can catch it just before it acts silly, but some locations are near such
noisy roads (and my aged hearing isn't what it used to be ... and never
was) that I get a fountain anyway.  I'll try turning the nozzle sideways
to see how that works.  Does it matter which way you turn it, left or
right?
