&gt; &gt; I have an '83 that hesitates and bucks between 35-50 mph. This occurs
&gt; &gt; especially around 42-47 mph. The van runs great above and below these speed
&gt; &gt; ranges.

I had a bucking problem in my '89 Vanagon that was traced to a bad 
ignition coil!  New Rule: Don't let the Vanagon sit a long time without 
a tune-up at regular intervals.

ObVWRepair: This weekend I had the dash of my Rabbit open to install a 
new head unit and discovered why I had rough idles! Apparently a vaccum
line to the climate controls had come off and was just laying there
sucking air. Now all I need to do is replace my oil pressure switches
and I'll be back to perfect. (I suspect 11 years is a long lifetime for
a car relay.)
