Subject: Storm, out, EV

Yow! 52 hours without electricity, now I'm back on the air. We had a low
Tuesday afternoon of approx 972 mb, local winds clocked in the +70 mph
range as a result. And a big tree came down, taking 3 utility poles with
it.

And for the obligatory VW content: I was driving my new van around a downed
tree, and dented the side of it on a branch. Bummer. $300 to repair because
its behind all the camper equipment. I haven't decided whether to repair it
or just let it go as the &quot;first dent&quot; so I don't have to worry about it
anymore.

anyway, if you sent me mail in the past few days I'll get to it shortly.
