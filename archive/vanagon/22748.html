Subject:       quick word on compressors

I reccommend buying one of the belt driven models, as opposed to the
'direct-drive' stuff currently being hawked.  I'd bought a 3.5 HP
direct drive and it was SO LOUD and vibrated so much it would scoot
across the floor.  I returned it the same day.  The belt drives are
much smoother and quieter.  the direct drives do have the advantage
of being 'oiless' so for painting they may be the way to go.  

my 3 HP compressor is probably the best and most used all-purpose
shop tool i have bought.  it is a purchase no tinkerer will regret.
