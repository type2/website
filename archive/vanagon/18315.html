&gt; Hi All.  I saw a 1992 Eurovan Double Cab Pickup truck today in the 
&gt; Vancouver, BC area.  It had the fold down sides like the Vanagon and 
&gt; previous types as well.  It sure looked strange.  The roof line had 
&gt; deep V grooves on either end of the roof to act as rain channels (I 
&gt; guess), and 4 doors with external hinges.  It was a chalky blue 
&gt; colour.  It wasn't in the best shape (or clean) but the owner seemed 
&gt; quite content.  The rear wheels even had it's own round fenders.  
&gt; 
&gt; I must admit that it looked weird.  Anybody else seen one of these in 
&gt; North America??

There are 2 that I know of in Victoria. One actually came to my
neighbour's house, I had a wee quick look and thought that they look more
French than German :)
