Subject: Redline MTL or MT-90 in an '84 4-spd?

Hello,

I am a new owner of an '84 Wasserboxer/4-spd.  In the past I have  
always changed whatever was in the tranny to Redline synthetic  
tranny oil in my cars.  I also remember that on the VW newsgroup a  
few years back there seemed to be some controversy about the use of  
Redline in VWs.  Is anyone out there using Redline in their tranny.   
If so are you using MTL or MT-90?

Many advTHANKSance.

Cheers,
  - pavneet
