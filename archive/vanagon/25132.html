Subject: Re:  Bike Racks

I have a Rhode Grear &quot;cycle shuttle&quot; on the front of my westy, and it
seems to work there fine.  I, too, didn't like the idea of putting
something on the back, and then having to remove it to open the hatch.
This particular company makes racks which are nearly infinitely 
continiously adjustable, and can adapt to nearly any car, any angle.
