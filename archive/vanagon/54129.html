&gt; &gt; BBBRRRRRRR!!!! Woke up to an eye opening -12F (-55F wind chill) in Nebraska
&gt; &gt; today. Not surprisingly, although it was a first, the vanagon would not
&gt; &gt; start, not even with the help of a neighbors running truck.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This cold snap is expected to last well into next week, so I am soliciting
&gt; &gt; advise from experienced cold-climate listees. What are some good strategies
&gt; &gt; for getting going on sub-zero mornings?
&gt; 
&gt; OPTIONS:
&gt; 1) Install a block heater.
 

Hi: I don't know how common block heaters are in the States. The Tristar
I have came from Canada and it is equiped with a block heater that is a
3/4&quot; thick plastic block with heating elements in it that fits under and
against the engine block. I could climb underneath to see if I can find
any markings or part numbers if I was coaxed. I bring this up because
this is the only one I have ever seen and assume it is a VW piece.  Todd
