Subject: Re: Need:instument pod frame

My guess is that spilled brake fluid causes the plastic to fail.  After 
having brake fluid changed I noticed it leaking out the front and bottom 
of the dash, and I guess the mechanic had spilled some.  The next day, 
screws and pieces of plastic from the instrument cluster started falling 
on my feet as I drove.

&gt; Wow, weird. My '82's were all cracked up at the corners and I just swapped 
&gt; in the '84's.  I wonder what makes them do this?  Heat? Cold?  Some kind of
&gt; chemical getting on them?  Why was my '84s in such good shape?   Anyone else
&gt; seeing this or know why they disintegrate?
