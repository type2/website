Subject: Living in the Hearland (how is it?)
Date: Thu, 21 Sep 95 16:57:00 EDT

Amazingly enough I have a job interview with Raytheon/Beech
aircraft in Wichita, KS next week and assuming all goes very
well, I'm wondering what it is like to live in the heartland
(if KS is the hearland, midwest? whatever)  If anybody lives
out there and has time to drop me a line to tell what it's like
please do.  I'm sort of terrified of leaving the beautiful, WV
VA, OH, PA, scenery I'm used to for the FLLLAAAATTTTTTT land,
but if a job is there, I am there.  Particularly I'm wondering where
people in the heartland go to hike, camp, etc, though I guess
Colorado is only a couple hours away.  Anyway thanks for advice.
