Hi,
I am wondering if there is anyone in Atlanta who does their own work on
their bus, and if so could I pay you to teach me a few things? I am wanting
to do a valve adjust on my '77 westy, along with new points, compressor,
timing, air filter this weekend. I am a little freaked about attempting on
my own, I have muir and have read it over and over, but alas when I climb
under I am afraid that I am going to do something terribly wrong and kill my
bus which is running great. I will happily pay you the going mechanic rates
etc. Well it is a long shot but... Thanks.
Peace,       &quot;Now shake it, shake it Sugaree, I'll meet you at the jubilee,
Scoob         and if that jubilee don't come, maybe I'll meet you on the run&quot;
              Jerry Garcia
