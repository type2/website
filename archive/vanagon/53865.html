&gt; Your explanation of the effects of a dirty injector do not conform with the
&gt; symtoms that I am experiencing.  The motor starts up fine and runs well until
&gt; its hot. 
          Can you be more specific as to how long it will run good?
 
 Then the problems starts with black smoke, mis-firing, and no power. 
&gt; Then I turn if off, and then back on again and it runs fine for a short while
&gt;
       short while?  whats that?

   Do you have to let it cool first? Or will it run just by turning it
   off and back on right a way?

 and then the problems starts up again.

      I was under the impression that the electonics were already
      checked!        Check , the O2 sensor, temp. sensor and wiring.
                      Both are regular problem.
