Subject: RE: Mofoco (was Heads/GEX SAGA) 

My personal experience with MOFOCO concerned a trans for a 1980 Vanagon . Now 
this was a &quot;Remanfactured&quot; trans with a 12/12 warranty. At 13,000 miles and 
less than a year and a half  The unit began to first whine then scream. 
Getting the opinion of a VW trained mech confirmed a bad main pinion bearing. 
Now I understand that I was out of waranty but here is the problem; One would 
presume that a reman of any mechanical unit would involve both a visual as 
well as a instrument check on some of the more vital pieces aka bearings , 
syncros , gears . It seemed pretty obvious that a visual check was done all 
right, one of the outside of the trans case !  To add insult to injury ,there 
was no dealing with these folks. They would hear and have none of it, sticking 
firmly to the position that I was out of warranty and that was that.  I have 
other VW friends that have had bad experiences with mofoco. Personally I would 
not deal with them again. Just my .02
