	Joe, All,
	I went looking for one of those Revell bus kits and couldn't
find any. If anyone sees one, I'll pay $15 for the kit and postage for
it. Years and years ago, I remember it was available as a bus with
windows. Revell used to make a Vanagon kit, marketed in this country 
as a Magnum PI spin-off. I gave one to my friend Ken, who built it up to 
mimic his Vanagon.
	I've never seen a larger than 1:25 kit, or any model of the
bay-window version. Anyone else?

	I've got a Solido 1:43 Kombi, red and white, stitting here on
my desk for inspiration. And a 1:87 fire-truck Transporter Van, and, 
sigh, a 1:87 Vanagon Crew Cab (!!!!) at home too.

	Bill
