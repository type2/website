Subject: Re: Thermostat/Too cool

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;If a new thermostat does not work you can return it to the dealer. They have
&gt;&gt;&gt;been making too much $$$ from all of us anyway. Good luck
&gt;&gt;      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt;           For a similar situation, my friend is replacing his GM/Pontiac's
&gt;&gt;           MacPherson struts. The rubber bearings cost more than the struts.
&gt;&gt;

I had to replace a leaky slave clutch cylinder a few years back for my 84
vanagon. The dealer askd around $140 for the OEM parts which was actually
made by ATE (the brake parts manufacturer). I found the exact same part from
my local Economy Imports for $70.

I once inquired front brake pads for my vanagon. The dealer quoted around
$70 but the pads were actually REPCO (sp?) pads. They did not have OEM pads.
I checked my FLAPS and REPCO pads costed around $35.

I see your point here that dealers tend to over charge, including VW dealers.
