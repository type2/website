Subject: Re: Repost - 1980 Vanagon seats

Is there a way to install temporary seats in the open space between the =
&gt;driver's/passenger's front seats and the bench seats in the back of the =
&gt;80 Vanagon.  There is a *lot* of space there and when not camping, it =

Go get the double bench seat and two rails from a junkyard.  If you can 
figure out how to get the flooring up out of the way, you can remove the six 
big plastic threaded plugs into the floor metal and bolt down the tracks, 
get the bolts too! Then slide in the seat. Slide out when not wanted.  You  
can't get into the fridge unless you slide the seat out half way.  I did 
this in my Westy conversion, but I was putting in fresh flooring, so I just 
carefully made it so a panel about 18&quot; x 40&quot; lifts out once the carpet is 
rolled up, exposing the rails for 2 minute install.  All VW stock 
installation, safest way I feel. You need to remount one lapbelt end onto 
the seat frame, since normally the winder unit is in the wall. You may be 
able to do the flooring cut with a Skil saw set for shallow depth, 1/4&quot; or 
so. Nothing electrical in the way :)  Tim Smith
