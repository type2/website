Subject:      engine heaters

I know it is a bit early in the season to be thinking cold and snow but
here in Montana it is never too far off.  At any rate I'd like to be ahead
of the stuff this year and would like to know if anyone out there knows
where I can find the engine heaters that attach to the bottom of a vanagon
water cooled engine.  I know they existed for the older air cooled engines
but I can't seem to locate a heater for my 87GL.
Thanks,
Dave Stratton
