Subject: Looking for 80-83 Westy in BC

After much consideration, I have now (almost) decided that I want an 
aircooled Westy, mainly because of lower initial price, and the 
fear_of_expensive_head_and_or_gasket_failure_syndrome which appears 
to go along with owning a newer (and nicer) Westy. I know, I know - 
many of you have 150-200K on your wasserboxers without trouble, but 
the truth is, spending $10-14K would be stretching my budget so I 
could not risk expensive repairs.

So.... I am now looking for an 80-83 a/c Westy, 4 speed, in the $6000 
price range. Most important feature is a good body, as I detest rust 
repairs, and plan to keep this vehicle for a long time.

(Ultimately, I am still seeking a diesel Westy to convert to an inline 4, but 
have realized that my chances of finding one at a decent price are 
near zero....)

One question still lingers, and may be answered when I do drive one, 
is: Do they have HEAT?! By this I mean enough heat to drive it in say 
0 to -10 C without getting numb feet? I've heard that newer vans are 
much better for heat, but my experience with a/c VWs is limited to a 
'69 bus which was well, COLD. (until it burnt up, that is....)

Thanks for any advice, and please pass on any Westy sightings under, 
say $10K...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
