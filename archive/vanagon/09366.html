So John Huguenard says:
&gt; 
&gt; I was looking for loose solder joints etc, but everything looked OK.  I
&gt; reassembled it and it worked the same as before, which turned out to be
&gt; perfect, after I fixed a short in an input cable.
&gt; 

As long as we are going to completely to death, I just wanted to add that
I remember someone a while back had mentioned that the ground shield was
shorted to the signal line.  Was that you John?  Anyway, even John Muir
mentions that most of the F.I. problems are some kind of continuity 
problems and have sent many a stranded motorist to the garage when all
that had to do was clean and crimp a loose connection.  I guess the 
tradition gets handed down.
