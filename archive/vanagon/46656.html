Subject: RE:My propane not Working

&gt;James,
&gt;    Thanks for your response to my propane filling problem. I have been
&gt;opening the bleeder valve, although next time I try to fill it I'll make sure
&gt;that its all the way open.
&gt;You don't think the problem is that the re-set button won't move? The
&gt;instuctions
&gt;say if the gas won't flow or flows very slowly push the re-set button, and
&gt;mine won't
&gt;push. Maybe the re-set button only moves with the bleeder valve all the way
&gt;open.

It's probably already pushed in.  It needs pressure from inside the tank to
push it out.  Make sure the MAIN valve is turned all the way in the right
direction too.  If it's not you can't get gas in...duh.  It is tricky i'm
not sure that it is turns in the direction that one would expect.

James
