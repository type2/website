Subject: Rocker Shafts--1600cc

Hi folks,

All through this record breaking winter I've been liesurely cleaning up
spare engine parts, derusting/painting tin and buying tools for the
inevitable rebuild I'll be needing someday (I'm up to about 60k on my 1600cc
single port now).  I just cleaned up some rocker shafts last night and
noticed some binding after a lube/assembly.  There are some deep grooves on
the shaft under the outer rocker arms that you can easily catch your
fingernail on.  The grooves run with the length of the shaft under the outer
rockers (I'd expect the grooves to be with the back and forth travel of the
rockers so I think that's a little strange--maybe a result of oil
depravation?).  I haven't miked the shafts yet or looked up the specs in the
Bentley, but I'm guessing it's time for new shafts.

I was thinking of just getting new shafts (I see Mofoco and Berg have them
for $44/pair), but my question is, do the rocker arms require some honing
and/or is a spec given for the maximum ID on the rockers?  I see the Berg
kit that includes the swivel adjusters, new shafts, spacers also comes with
used rocker arms but aside from glass beading, they don't mention any other
reconditioning on them.
