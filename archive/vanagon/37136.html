Subject: WCM rubber arrives

Hi folks,

I just received my rear hatch seal and engine door seals for my 71 that I
ordered last week from WCM.  The rear hatch seal looks like an exact
duplicate of the original--it should be since it's OEM.  It turns out WCM
does not make an aftermarket version for these but they do make an
aftermarket, less-expensive version of the sliding door seal.  I think I
could've saved $20 if I shopped around and maybe more if I caught a sale for
the same item:  I ended up paying $102 for no more hatch leaks.  The seal
had white talc-like powder on it--maybe to protect it during storage?.  I
treated it with Armor All and now it looks like it should and feels supple.
I wonder if regular Armor All treatments will significantly lengthen its life?  

I wasn't too pleased with the appearance of the $15 engine door seals (set
of 4 strips replaces the one piece seal I have there now).  I'll know more
when I fit them, but they look like they aren't flexible enough to make a
good seal.
