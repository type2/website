Subject:      Re: Oil plug stripped, fix needed

I found the same problem of a stripped out drain plug in my 86 when I
bought it. I tapped it out to the thread size of the pressure relief
valve of a type one engine. I used the plug from a type one because it
is machined to be used with a metal sealing washer that will fit nicely
and seal on the shoulder that is left. You will have to use a large
screwdriver to change the oil though.

&gt;         Imagin my surprise when I went under my &quot;new&quot; 84 Westfalia to change
&gt; the oil and found a one inch bolt sticking out of the oil plug area.  a wing
&gt; nut device ther was holding a rubber stopper in place.  This thing holds the
&gt; life blood of the engine in.  I wiggled it and it fel off in my hand!  My
&gt; oil pan was already there but what if this had happened on the road!!!
&gt;         I replaced the rubber stopper and it seems to be holding.  I ordered
&gt; a new bolt from the dealer but I suspect that the inner threads may be
&gt; stripped.  I'll try a new bolt but then what?  I have a good shadetree
&gt; mechanic near buy but what is the best fix for this?  Help.
