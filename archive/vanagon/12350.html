Subject: Re: List Bumper Sticker?


The Autocross list....&quot;Team.Net&quot; have stickers with the list name
and a &quot;generic&quot; car racin' around pylons...perhaps
we could have the list name with each of the four generations
of Type 2s on each of the corner, and the list name in the center.

hey, what do you want for a non-caffeene influenced suggestion!
