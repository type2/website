&gt; This list has lost it.  Out to lunch!  Duct tape?  Pig squeals?

&gt; alignment in the solar system I've not been told about?

well, actually you've misunderstood again. must be some bad encryption
routines enroute.

anyway, what it was all about was that if you use duct tape as a condom,
you'll squeal like a pig when you try to take it off.

                         :)

and, yes, there IS a once-in-a-lifetime alignment in the solar system. and
i'm very surprised that you weren't told. ALLLLL the invitations were sent
out MONTHS ago! we all wondered why YOU didn't show up.
