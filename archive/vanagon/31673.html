Subject: Gas Heater FS in CO


Saw this in this morning's paper.  I don't know what make, model, vintage 
or shape it is in.  I called and left a message for the owner and will 
report what he has to say when he calls back.  Here's the ad:

Gas Heater for VW Bus.  Fits 67-74.  $300/obo.  (970)416-8301.
