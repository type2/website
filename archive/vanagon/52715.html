Subject: More Big Buses (funny cargo)

I missed out on posting this last week but thought you might find the
stories amusing.

In college my two friends and I bought all of the 10lb. bags of potatoes at
the local grocery store.  75 bags to be exact.  Loaded them up in my 71 bus
and then drove 180 miles to our other friend's carport and dumped them.  I
think it was for a birthday present.  The bus drove like a champ and the
only problem was that we discovered that a few of the potatoes were rotten
when we ran the heater.  The neighbors of the receipient just laughed.  And
for the PC people out there the potatoes were donated to a food kitchen. 
Stopped at a Denny's in the middle of the night and ordered some food.  We
knew something was up when we heard a waitress said &quot;No wonder nothing is
happening, the grill isn't turned on&quot;.  Seems the cook called in sick and
no one there knew how to cook.  We thought of telling all of the people
waiting to be seated but then thought that they should have to find out
just like we did.

My 71 had the huge sliding sunroof.  I remember a friend standing up
through the sunroof (pre-seatbelt law) as a we drove through a gated
neighborhood and my friend yelling Merry Christmas to all of the people.

Finally a watercooled story.  We bought a crib for my soon to be born son
through the classifieds.  The price was right and the crib was in good
condition.  The seller said we'd have to take it a apart to get it into the
Eurovan.  Nope, it fit perfectly.  The only bummer was that we had to take
the crib apart to get it into my son's room. It's too bad that VW didn't
design the house.   Now my son sleeps in a bed and we are lending the crib
to some friends who are expecting soon.  The crib will either go in our
Eurovan or in their 69 Pickup to another happy house.

I hope you have as much fun hauling stuff in your VW vans as we have.
