Subject: crankcase sealant

For mating the crankcase halves Muir says VW case glue or No. 2 
Permatex.  I bought the latter _I think_. To be exact, the box says 
'Permatex FORM-A-GASKET No. 2 SEALANT ... nonhardening pliable sealant'.  
Is this OK to use?   The VW stuff gets hard pretty quickly, Muir says.
TIA!!
