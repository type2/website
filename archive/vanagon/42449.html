Subject: Odometer rerpair, 1985

Help!  My odometer is frozen.  I think it is related to the trip meter
which, when you push the button, clears to zero, but then only moves 1 to
2/10ths.
Can someone share your experiences about fixing this problem or replacing
the unit.  Junk yard? Rebuilt? If you have to replace the unit, can I swap
for a tach unit also? (Mine has an analog clock).
Thanks,

Bill Lund
