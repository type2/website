Subject: VWoA did fine by me

I have an 87 Syncro with 60K that just developed  &quot;The Leak&quot;.  As a result of
the discussions on this list I called VWoA to discuss. They were very nice,
requested local dealer verification of the problem. It is now at Whitney VW
 in Villa Park Il. for head replacement at no cost to me. When the holidays
slowed repairs they rented a car for me, again at 0 cost. I sure can not
complain. 
How much service should I expect from the new heads-more or less than the
original equipment? Is there a break in procedure?
