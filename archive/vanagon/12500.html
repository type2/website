Subject:      netsurfnugen

hmmmm. my vote is for

Net-Vergnugen

or what about

Email-vergnugen?   that might be more appropriate (since we really don't
                   'surfing', as it were).

Emale-vergnugen?  (to get martha all upsot). :)

of course, if we all loved to drink and get drunk, then it could be

Barf-vergnugen.    :)
