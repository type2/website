Greetings,

My wife and I borrowed a Westie for our honeymoon this summer, and now I am hooked......  On 
Westfalia's you pigs!!  I am now the proud owner of a 1983 Westie Camper.  My question is:

Is there a light behind the heater controls?  The one we borrowed (1990) had a light.  Before I take 
the dash apart, does this light exist on an '83.  If so, does anyone have any tricks for getting at the 
darn thing?

Cheers
Tony
