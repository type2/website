&gt;I am planning to make/buy a bug screen for my 85 Westy sliding door.
&gt;Do any of you fellow Vanagon listers have experiance making/buying one of
&gt;these? The bug screen would be used while the sliding door is open saving
&gt;wear and tear opening/closing the door while camping. Any information would
&gt;be helpful.
