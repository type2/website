&gt;Hmmm. This definition (provided by VanBondo on 7/9/96) seems to be at odds
with the one Thom gives us above.....

ellis replies:
&gt;&gt;&gt;Mrs. VanBondo corrected me last night. Betty and Barney as used in the
Alicia Silverstone movie &quot;Clueless&quot;  concurs with Thom's defns. Here I was
thinking of a coupling of a dopey Purple Dinosaur and Betty Page. Talk about
&quot;Clueless!&quot; Ooooooh I like discipline ;-)
OK beat me, whip me and make me return to a proper VW thread! Let's cool it
before Ger gets out the whip.
