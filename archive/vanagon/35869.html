Never wrenched on wasserboxers, but:

&gt;Don't forget another fact. The cylinders are steel, and the corrosion 
&gt;happens where the steel surface of the top of the cylinder touches the
&gt;head, right where the sealing ring is.

So... you could get rid of the problem by 'aluminizing' the Cylinders on
the outside and using an aluminum gasket material??? or maybe just a
coat of paint would do it.
