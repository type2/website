&gt; need to take off the flywheel or WHAT?? I understand 
&gt; the pilot bearing case is really hard to take out, but 
&gt; there seem to be things in front of it which won't let it 
&gt; go anywhere anyway. In my book these things are labelled
&gt; &quot;felt ring&quot; and &quot;distance ring&quot; (translated from German).
The felt ring and distance ring are on the back of the flywheel.
I can't remember, but I'm pretty sure the flywheel has to come off. I also
don't remember what year your bus is. The vanagons T3s have 5 hex head 
bolts (10mm if I remember right) The earliear vanagons and buses have one 
huge bolt that takes a breaker bar and a 36mm or 46 mm socket.  (I don't 
have one so I don't remember).


&gt; Of course we've tried the nuts on the flywheel. Man,
&gt; they're on tight!

&quot;Nuts?&quot;  Are they nuts or bolts.  Are there 5 of them? What are you using 
to hold the flywheel when you do this?  If you have the 5, they are 
torqued to 80 ft/lbs (Don't know the metric and my manual is in the garage).
They are hard to turn.  My dad and I sawed an end off a 10mm hex key and 
then put it in a 10mm socket with a 1/2&quot; drive. (13mm). With the flywheel 
firmly anchored to the case with a piece of angle-iron, we were able to 
turn the bolts. The flywheel slipped right off after they were out.

&gt; By the way, I haven't found any bolts that required a 12-point
&gt; Hazett tool yet. Went in search of one Friday morning.
&gt; Found one after 2.5 hours. Took it home, tried it in the
[]
&gt; CV bolts, didn't fit. Looked at them more closely. Turned 
&gt; out they took a 6mm Allen key.. (or was it 8mm I don't 
&gt; remember now) Maybe they've been changed before due to 
&gt; the rarity of the tool. Anyhow, 2 of them can't even be
&gt; taken off with the vice grips. My husband puts the grips 

No. Some of them had 8mm hex if I've heard right. Mine have the star tool.
They are 8 mm. I needed an 8mm hex to remove the starter, so I turned 
that &quot;hazett&quot; tool backward and put it in a socket.  This gives much 
better leverage. try this on the CV bolts.

&gt; it before I had to leave to catch the train to come to 
&gt; work and write this e-mail!) If we have to torch out the
&gt; pilot bearing, how do you do it? Isn't is dangerous with
&gt; all this oil and stuff around? Also, unless we get the
&gt; bolts out on the right-side CV joint, we don't have a lot
&gt; of room to maneuver. (How do you &quot;drill&quot; bolts out?)

My approach to the CVs would be to 
1. Try getting a hex key in a socket to work.
2. Apply some heat (watch for the boots)
3. File flats on the bolts and clean them and grip them with the vice grips.
4. Drill a hole through the head sideways and use a pin punch to turn 
   with a vice grips while tapping on the head of the bold.

Hope some of that helps.  I'm no mechanic.
