Subject: VW Ads from &quot;Life&quot;

In a box of books we bought at an auction yesterday were lots of old &quot;Life&quot;
mags from the late 60's &amp; early 70's.  I went thru them last night looking
for VW advertising, and tho' I found no Bus ads (at all!) I tore out 5 or 6
Beetle ads.
I'm happy to send them to anyone who wants them--I don't particularly.
Email me with your postal address &amp; I'll get them right out.  First come,
first served.
