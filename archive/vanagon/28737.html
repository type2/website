Subject: Odometer

Anyone know how to repair the odometer, mine doesn't work and the gas gauge
doesn't either.  Makes for an interesting trip.  If I need to replace the
speedometer how much is a new, used, overhauled one going to cost.  Does the
vanagon have a peculiar speedo or can it be replaced with one from another
type VW?  How difficult a job to drop the tank and replace fuel sending unit?

Oil sending unit can leak oil.  Replaced mine and no more oil drips under the
van.
