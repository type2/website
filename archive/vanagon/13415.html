&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;	I am curious as to what other people out side of california
&gt;do for heat in there buses.  I haven't driven one through a minesota
&gt;winter yet, but I can't imagine it would be enjoyable.  My '72 doesn't
&gt;even have the heat pipe running from the engine to the front of the
&gt;vehical (I aquired the bus from a dealer after some guy from cali. blew up
&gt;the engine on a cross county trip).  As I am planing to run this bus in
&gt;the winter next year I was curious what others due for heat?  I am thinking
&gt;of buying some header wrap and wrapping the heat exchangers with it.  It
&gt;is intended to keep heat in the exhaust and engine bay temps lower (usually
&gt;you don't see it unless on race cars), But it would seem to me that if you
&gt;can keep the temp inside the heat exchangers higher that your availible
&gt;heating capacity would be higher, of course I only got a &quot;C&quot; in thermodynamics
&gt;so I would like to know if anyone else has tried this and how well it 
&gt;works.  Hell, worst case you wouldn't get anymore heat, but you would
&gt;lower engine temp!!!  I know this stuff works, it lowered the temp in 
&gt;a friends '34 benz replica 20+ degrees (chev. v-8 powered).
&gt;
&gt;Any other sugestions on heating a bus when it's 20 below out!!
