Subject: Hitch Question - 69 Bus

I am wanting to add a hitch to my 69 Bus.  I haven't figured out all of the
engineering yet to hang a frame hitch from the same general area as the rear
motor hanger and bumper mounting area, so I thought I'd see if someone on the
vanagon list had done this or had it done successfully.
 
What I need is a hitch that would allow me to pull a tandem UHaul car trailer.
 
Also, would a pickup-style step-bumper be feasible as a bumper/hitch point
for a VW Bus?
