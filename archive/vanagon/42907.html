Subject: Clubs, need ideas about function


Hello all,

In a burst of Volkswagen Bus Enthusiasm, that I may eventually regret, I have
taken the responsibility for starting a Tucson Chapter of the Arizona Bus Club.

The ABC sponsers such events as the Jerome Jamboree and the Corona del Tucson
Jamboree.  Both of these are car-show/swap-meet/camping/chile-cook-off/etc.
types of events.  They also have a newsletter, t-shirts, monthly meetings,
and set up booths at other events like the Phoenix Bug-O-Rama.

What I am interested in, and the reason for writing this message, is to gather
ideas for other things a Volkswagen bus oriented club might do.  Personally,
I am interested in discussing/fixing/learning-about/using/buying/selling/
showing/looking-at/maintaining/restoring VW busses and perhaps a few other
things I've missed.  How can a club enrich a person's life?  I really enjoy
this mailing list but I want to interact with more people face-to-face and
look at more vehicles, thats why I am instigating this Tuscon chapter.

So, what does a club do?  Anyone out there belong to local Volkswagen clubs?
What do they do well?  What do they do poorly?  What do you think they
*should* be doing?  etc. etc.

Ideas welcome!

 -Dyer
