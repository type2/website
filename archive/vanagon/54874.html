Subject: Re: question about Macs and VW relation

&gt;I'm just wondering if there is a connection between VW owners and Macintosh
&gt;users?  Seems that most people I know that have a Mac, have a VW, and most
&gt;of the time it's a van.  I have a Macintosh Duo 2300c and an 85
&gt;Transporter. . .
&gt;What do PC users prefer? Or am I the odd ball out?
&gt;
&gt;Hope I don't start something. . .  ?~)  &lt;-- That's a face with a black eye
&gt;and a bent nose.
&gt;


I luv my Macintosh! I own an 85 Panel camper. I think my masintosh is the
best computer in the world. I work as a staff scientist in a Science center
and we have 200 of the latest macintosh's. I own a performa 5300cd with 64
megs of ram, ahhh ram. It also has a tv tunner and a zip drive. I have
nothing agianst Pc's. I just prefer my macintosh.
