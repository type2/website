Subject: Vanagon FI Test Equip &amp; Sorry

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------
Sorry about my earlier post. Seems way to harsh. I'd hate to be 
judged by my own inner critic! Anyway, before I get to the good stuff
(digifant fuel injection
test equipment for 86-91 vans) here are a few responses to all of your
responses:

1. The problem with my getting messages ID'd to the original sender instead
of ID'd 
to the list is indeed a problem with my solftware on AOL, not the list. I
should of checked 
this before blasting out a mindless message. :-)

2. I take back most of what I said about the list. I love the list.

3. Yes, the frustration is from the fact that it takes a while to scan
messages on AOL. The problem isn't so much the $4 an hour AOL charges but my
own personal time. I guess I could switch to digest mode if I was that
concerned. Then I could blast through 30 messages at once using a scroll bar.
Somehow the digest mode misses something, however, in that you can't store
files by subject and it is harded to respond to individual topics.

4. I still die every time I see someone trying to win the posting
sweepstakes.

5. At the base of my comments must be an unexamined assumption that a message
on the list should contain information about VW vans (or requests for
information.) I must have the unconscious idea that without information a
message is less valid. Perhaps this isn't right.

FUEL INJECTION PARTS (DIGIFANT)

I have been doing some analysis of the tools you would want to buy for
repairing and 
maintaining the Digifant fuel injection system (86-91) according to the
factory way. The 
following tools are factory VW parts. In almost every case, it is probable
that there is a 
cheaper way to go. Here are the tools and notes. Reference to Zelenda is to
the big general 
motors of VW tools sales. Their number is 718-896-2288 (attn: Ivana) and they
ship UPS to 
anyone with a credit card. 	

1. Sun tool 120.239; a hose from Sun company for getting exhaust out of the
van before the 
catalytic converter. About $100.

2. Sun 105 CO Tester; superceded by MGA-1400. Both big motha CO and exhaust
testers.  
About $5,000 each. Would the JC Whitney tester work just as well for $150?

3. US 1115 voltage tester; superceded by VAG1527A or VAG 1527B; available
from Zelenda; 
$17; measures presence of current. Possibly special because it doesn’t drain
much current 
and hence won’t damage the ECU. Looks like a little wire with an LED on the
end. 
Required.

4.   US 1119 multimeter; probably any multi meter will do but the Kent-Moore
J34029-A 
was originally designated for Vanagon, superceded by the superior Fluke 83.
Fluke 85, 87, 
and the automotive model Fluke 88 are all superior but more expensive than
the adequate 
Fluke 83. Cost: about $220 for Fluke 83. Joel has Fluke 83. Required.

5. VW 1315A/1 adapter. Little piece of wire about $35 at Zelenda. Test
Harness (two prong) 
used in conjunction with US 1119 multimeter used to check diferential
pressure reg. 
current. Required.

6. VW 1315A/2 adapter; Test Harness (three Prong) as above for checking idle
stablization 
system; about $35 from Zelenda. Required.

7. VW 1318 pressure measuing equipment; available as VAG1318/99 from Zelenda
$293. 
Price at left includes 1318/1./2./3,/4,/6,/67,8/,9,/10,11,13,23 and VAG1343.
Seems like an 
optional set of equipment.  

8. VW 1318/17 adapter; but do you have to buy it as VAG1318/1? Seems like you
have to buy 
it as part of the above 1318 set. Seems like an optional piece. 

9. VW 1367 tester seems like the big motha V.A.G. tester; $499 for a rebuilt
or exchange 
unit; $1,930 new but no longer available; superceded by 1598, whatever that
is. Available 
from dealers going out of business cheap as this is a superceded tester.  I
bought mine for 
$30.

10. VW 1473 Adaptor; $28; required to use the above tester but this adapter
is no longer 
available from Zelenda. Seems to have been superceded by the $90 VW1367/8
adapter but 
Zelenda doesn’t know this. This is the voltage devider used with VW1367 to
measure rpm 
and ignition timing with digifant

11. VW 1490 double adapter; superceded by the VAG1630. This might be just a
15K resistor. 
The VAG 1630 goes for $165 at Zelenda but the original VW1490 still available
for about $50 
at official VW parts supplier Assenmacher Specialty Tools 303-530-2424.

12. US8026 is a simple hand vacum pump for $63. Possibly similar to the
MightyVac things 
in various USA catalogs.

13. US4487 is an Evaporator System Leak Tester (slack tube) available for
about $100 from 
Zelenda. Seems like an optional piece and not required.

Comments: The price total for the above stuff is about  $7,700 but all the
big money is in the 
VAG1367 tester and the CO tester. Most tests can be done with a common $20
Radio Shack 
multimeter and possibly a radio shack LED soldered onto two wires. There is a
possibility, 
however, that the Radio Shack multimeter would damage delicate ECU and that
for this 
reason the Fluke 83 is better, Joel speculates. Also, the Fluke is bound to
be better at the 
amp measurements as it measures 2 amp current. The earlier Kent Moore does
not handle 
this 2 amp current. Non-digital multimeters are out as they are not sensitive
enough.
