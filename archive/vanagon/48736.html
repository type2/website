&lt;&lt; While dirving at highway speed my 89 Westy will suddenly loses power for 
 2-3 seconds. After the lurch the engine runs fine the rest of the trip. 
  This symptom happens occasionally- say three times in a month. Its 
 taking away the fun on driving.  Does any one have any ideas?

I had the same problem after buying some real cheap gas - it had some water
in it.
It would do it from time to time as the water beads sloshed around the bottom
of the tank and would be sucked into the fuel line.  It was in the winter
time and when the temp reached freezing the problem really got bad as the
water would start freezing in the fuel filter and shutting off the fuel
supply.  Many cans of dry gas didn't help.
I finally had to drain the fuel tank - flush with alcohol - change the fuel
filter.  It worked great - no more engine cut outs at speed.
