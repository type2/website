Michael is correct , BUT let me add that :

DON'T DO THIS TO AN ALTERNATOR!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you aren't sure if you have an alternator or a generator, either find
someone who positively can tell you what you have, or find a qualified shop to
handle it for you else you could wind up needing ANOTHER new alternator!
