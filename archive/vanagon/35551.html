&gt;I have previously mentioned one easy hop up available at engine 
&gt;overhaul is to stroke the 1.9 liter engine (involves modifying 
&gt;the crankshaft only) and installing 2.1 liter pistons.  If a 
&gt;camshaft regrind is incorporated at the same time, you can net 
&gt;a 15-20% increase in power. 

2.1 has better cam, larger throtle plate than 1.9.  I would find a 2.1. Parts
from 2.1 should fit into 1.9 case.  I would be a little catious about cam
profile.  These engines have tough time now with HC emmisions at idle.  That
slight miss at idle is cause. Radical cam will worsen this effect.  I believe
a mojor gain can be found in the exhaust.  Stock muffler very restrictive.  I
have seen Glass packs fitted.  Very noisy but impressive results.
