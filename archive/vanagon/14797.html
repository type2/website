Subject: Re: Should I Buy this Synchro?

&gt; 
&gt; $8,000 for an '87 Synchro with a new engine?  Holy smokes!  What do 
&gt; you want?!?  Dicker?!?  He's willing to dicker?!?  What a steal.  Now
&gt; if it were me, I would already be driving the van.  But wait!  Will
&gt; your dad do all of the maintenance things that we on the list do (e.g.
&gt; bleed the cooling system regularly) to keep our babies running, or is

Thanks for the opinion, I too thought it is incredible, but the
guy who owns it is sort of an idiot and not much of a VW van person,
as to dad he has always done regular maintanence on his cars
meticulously, he was adjusting valves on his '65 thirty years ago
himself since day one, has rebuilt type I's and IV's and certainly is up
to the task, I was more interested in what to expect in terms of
reliabilty of the major components we can't help.  As to the price,
sorry my only comparison is NADA which puts it at about $7000, I know
from my Quantum Synchro experience that these things go much above NADA
but didn't know just how much, the other negative I failed to mention is
the guy is a smoker and has 4 small kids so the interior stinks and is a
little worn, but really much better than I had expected for all those
kids, we (me and my 2 sisters) beat up our old '68 much worse in 8
years. Still yet it is 8+ years old, the rest of that $1000 exhaust will
probably go within 2-3 years, and if anything happens to the tranny you
can only pray for the used parts gods to bless you.  All the same, I
will probably take a good long look this week and he may buy this thing
within a few weeks, if he doesn't and anyone else is interested, I'll
post info on my findings, like I said pretty darn clean vav on first
look.
