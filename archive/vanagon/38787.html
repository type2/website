Subject: what kind of oil?
Date: Tue, 2 Apr 1996 10:46:32 -0600 (CST)

Hi.  I just rebuilt my '71 bug engine and am ready to fill her
up w/ oil.  I was wondering if I could get any input on what the
best kind of oil to get is.  I am thinking synthetic, but don't think
I can afford it.  Is that synthetic/natural blend any good for air
cooled engines?  If I go w/ natural, what weight should I get?

Thanks,

jeff
