Subject: New NEATO Bus Web Page


Seeing how the news is out via the latest Old Bus Review, I guess 
I can release the news to the great unwashed masses...

NEATO now has a presence on the WWW.  The page has VERY LIMITED 
info from the latest issues of OBR.  As time permits I will be 
adding MUCH MORE editorial material from back issues.  

There will also be Technical Data on the page (including the 
infamous M-Codes that caused such a stink from non-NEATO members!).

If you like what you see and are interested in joining NEATO, you 
can get a sample issue of OBR and application from sending email 
via the page.

I know a few of the links have problems now, but I won't have a 
chance to fix them probably until Saturday night.

So create a bookmark for

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html

and enjoy!

If you have any comments or suggestions, you can send them to me at 

deasterw_at_st6000.sct_dot_edu  or
deasterw_at_mindspring_dot_com

Dave
