Subject:      &lt;thump&gt; &lt;thump&gt; Can I Have Your Attention, Please? ...

as everyone may have noticed, there has been cast a deathly pall over the
communications &lt;bovine scatology&gt; of this group. like, there's a problem,
Dude!! but Gerry, stalwart fellow that he is, has leaped into the fray,
slinging code and instructions hither and yon, slashing through files and
unclogging gateways with the skill, nah, expertise of Roto-Rooter!

well, something like that anyway.

but in the meantime, we return you to your regularly schedule b.s. :)

joel
