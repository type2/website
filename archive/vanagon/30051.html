&gt;&gt; a) a 1971 camper, some rust, rebuilt engine and clutch,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; b) a 1986 Wasserboxer, scratches on body, 130K, new clutch...
&gt;
More details on both, $$$ especially,  Having owned a brand new 1971, in the
same year natch, and an '85 and '87 wasserinmachin I'd go for the '86 in a
flash, despite the tendency towards drips.  There is no comparison in
driveability, the '86 will motor.  The price of two new heater boxes and a
muffler for the '71 will cover materials and a large portion of the labour
to put in one new head gasket in the '86.   Check out both vehicles with a
fine toothed comb, then post again.  A lot of threads lately on readying old
buses for winter, sealing air leaks etc.  Lot less work for lot more heat if
the '86 head's are dry.  Look for dried coolant crusties, above and below
the engine.  And check out the '86 exhaust system, if it's poor, and the
heads leak buy the '71 :).   Tim Smith

BTW... the '71 was the warmest aircooled I owned!!
