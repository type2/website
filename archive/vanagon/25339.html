Subject: Re: Can you make the bus quiet?

dan&gt; Joel had some great tips on sound deadening. here's one more.
dan&gt;
dan&gt; go to any store like Target, Wal-Mart, etc. and buy a queen or
dan&gt; king size 'egg-crate' orthopedic pad ya s'posed to sleep on. they
dan&gt; are about $12-$15. if the interior panels are off, just cut pieces

        Check out a medical supply place and you can get it for even
less-around $5-6, as I recall, when I was pricing it here in Austin.

Peace,
