Subject: Re: BRM wheels...??


&gt;	Did BRM ( those nifty Cal-look wheels) ever make a four bolt version =
&gt;for  post '68 cars...??

They only ever made 5 bolt ones. They starting making these in 1967, just
when VW switched to 4 bolt wheels, and stopped again after a year or so.
Great marketing strategy or what?

&gt;	I just looked at a '69 Karmann Ghia coupe today that I swore had BRM =
&gt;wheels on it.... the kid who had the car said he thought they were some =
&gt;kind of aftermarket 914 wheel.... had never seen anything like 'em =
&gt;before....

I think I know the ones you're thinking of, they have four wide spokes with
square holes in them, right? They were a factory option on the 914 and you
can buy repro ones fairly cheaply. Oh well, at least they look nice.

&gt;	also has anyone else ever seen a roof rack tent for an early '60s =
&gt;bus...

Not that early but I've seen modern versions of these on some Vanagons. Sort
of like a self contained pop-top in a roof rack.
