Subject: showers afterall


I realize that my reputation with sucessful showering in/near
VW busses/vans has been less than exemplary on this list.  After
the Red Rock Mojave fiasco in 34F weather and 40+ mph winds in
the dark with lukewarm water and shower curtains/tarps blowing
askew, I became the subject of a near inhumane amount of ridicule.

Happily, however, I am now able to once again stand proud and tell
all of you that I've found something that I think actually works
quite well.  Some of you from the list some time back may remember
my post about a unit called Shower Anywhere, which I finally acquired.
(I'll post a copy of that info I posted long ago at the end of this
for those interested).  It was not inexpensive, but for me this
feature in REAL camping is a priority.  :)  Anyway, although I
have yet to be able to test it in a for-real camping setting, I
did test it here at home, and it worked quite well.  I promised
Michael Wagner and a few other I would report on that, so my
vote for the unit is a yes.  The water pressure is a little low,
but I think there may be a way to improve it.  Regardless, it
is a shower, and that makes me happy.  

My next daydreaming sessions are gonna be devoted to the shower
CURTAIN issue.  Think I'll probably end up velcro-ing up some
lt. weight plastic shower curtains around the perimeter of the
standing space in the westy, and catching the water in an 
action packer, or perhaps into an ice-chest with a drain spigot
(maybe attached to a plastic tubing hose exiting the vanagon
thru a tiny crack in the sliding door).
