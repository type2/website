&gt;How do I tell my wife I am going to look at TWO more splitties?  Do I look and
&gt;possibly buy and THEN tell her?  Do I casually mention it first?  HELP ADVICE
&gt;NEEDED.

Easy.  Tell her that your good ole Yank buddy Thom is gonna take care of
the car for you!  Yeah, thats it!

BTW - &quot;Barn door&quot; refers to busses '55 1/2 and older.
