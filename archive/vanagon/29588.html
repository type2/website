Subject: source for oil cooler foam seal?
Date: Sun, 26 Nov 1995 17:48:52 -0700
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


Does anyone have a decent source for the foam pad that wraps around
the oil cooler?  This is the thin piece of foam that covers the top,
front, and rear of the cooler, and acts as an air seal so that all the
air goes through it rather than around it.  RMMW knows what it is, but
doesn't carry it....

Thanks.
