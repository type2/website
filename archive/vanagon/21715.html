Subject: Anyone have &quot;universal&quot; gauges installed?

Has anyone installed a set of the universal type electric guages. The 
ones that have an oil pressure, oil or water temperature, and amps.
We need some gauges on the '81 Westy, and can't afford a set of VDO's
now. Has anyone any experiences with these? Do the NPT to metric fittings
work well. Can you put a T fitting in where the oil idiot sender goes
and hook these up there, and have them work ok? Thanks in advance!
Lisa
