OK...I run an Acorn (what you think) which operates using Riscos. Not PC
compatible and it has taken them this long to get a proper (well...) internet
suite together. As the system is still in Beta test (I learned wot that meenz)
I guess mail filters etc are not on their priority list..but I will hassle
them...
If you run a Barndoor list I'll subscribe :) :) :)
Old busers may do it more slowly but have a lot more fun!
