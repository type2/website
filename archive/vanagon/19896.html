Sergio has an idea:
&gt;$100 a days sound a bit expensive. Although hotels, transportation, etc may add up, you still
&gt;have to pay those expensive camping fees. Have you ever considered buying a van and then selling
&gt;it when you leave? I heard someone did that before and It worked quite well for them. I wonder
&gt;what you do if you can't sell it by the time it's time to go though. Hey maybe we should all (this list) chip in and buy a van and leave it in Europe, then anybody who belongs to the list (CLUB), can
&gt;take it for a spin while in Europe. It's just an idea!

And let's leave it in Paris, at my parent's house :-)
