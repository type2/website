 to know how.  I tell him I don't aactually 'know' him, but that
 I am familiar with who he is etc....
 
 He then proceeds to tell me how Jim &amp; Bill tried to destroy 
 his company.  They stole things out the back door, erased computer
 files, destroyed records, etc.....  Goes on and on about how there
 is a CASE #, and they're going to jail.... blah blah blah..... &gt;&gt;

I wouldn't have said all this if I were you.... 
I think Jim happens to be a fine listmember and has personally given me quite
a few helpful tips on Vanagons.., quite a few on the 2.1 installation into
his previously 1.9 '84 westy..
I'm sure the last thing he needs right now is to be publicly slammed on the
list of which he is an active member of....
think about it..
while my experience w/ Bus Boys as a business has not been overly spectacular
either, I don't think it is fair to blame it on one (or 2 ) persons.
Especially a fellow participating listmember..

maybe we should all just kill this thread before anyone elses personal
reputations are ruined??

just a thought....
