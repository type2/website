Subject: Re: CV boot kit prices

&gt; I called RMMW this morning and their $9.95 cv boot kit, complete with 
&gt; all of the hardware is on two week backorder.  Calls all over the 
&gt; world this morning has found that the next cheapest price for 
&gt; everything is about $16 per joint, with all of the bolts, clamps, 
&gt; washers, grease, etc.  Does anybody know of another source in the $10 
&gt; range?  Thanks, Jim

If you don't care about aftermarket stuff, NEAPCO down here in Beatrice 
is where I got mine while I was employed.  It might be worth a call.  You 
can them and ask to talk to girls in ReBox because you would like to 
check on availability of products.  Heck, you could even drive down here, 
get them, and drive home all in an afternoon.  But as far as $10 - I 
honestly don't remember how much they wanted for thekit.  Worth a try 
though...
