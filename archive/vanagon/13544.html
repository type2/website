Subject: Battery Tray for 70 Single Cab Pick Up

	Apparently, this isn't going to be as easy as it looked!
	When the rains suspended briefly Sunday, I took the lovely
battery tray replacement pannel that Bus Boys had sent me and tried
fitting it in the back of my single-cab. It doesn't fit! Its the right
length, 18 inches more or less, but a good 30mm, 1 1/4 inches too narrow,
at 10.25. For a cheap piece of sheet-metal, I'd be temped to say, OK,
we'll add some more and go from there. But this puppy cost $75!.

	Worse, I called Rocky Mountian Motorworks (The Bus Stop) and
they had the same too-narrow piece. They were very nice about it, but
its clear that what's being sold to the parts places as a pick-up
battery tray us just flat the wrong size, and jumbo priced ($29 vs $75)
compared to the 'regular' breadloaf bus part. Makes me wonder if there's
a business for me here, or if what I'm holding is a brazilian mix-master
T1.5 part!

	Neither Bus Boys nor RMM have the regular pannel in stock, so I
couldn't get them to measure it for me. Bus Boys said I could return the
part, with a photocopy of the invoice. I presume for credit, since I
bought on my Visa.

	So if I want a welded-in fix, its going to have to be
cut and bent to fit- the blank will be about 19&quot; X 12.5&quot;, with 1/2&quot;
wide edge breaks all around. I guess some light channel or a bent
piece of the same stuff can be used to make locators for the battery,
and of course a welded-in nut for the battery clamp.

	Guy I spoke with at RMM said that actually, he had a No Parking
sign fastened into his bus for a battery tray!
