Subject: watercooled engine avail.


I went to a wreck yard yesterday to look around for parts for my '80 
Vanagon and ran across a newer watercooled (probably 87-90) VANAGON GL. 
It was a total wreck from right above the front bumber all the way to the 
back seats (obviously had contact with a bulldozer - I hope not while 
being driven!), but the back (hatch, engine compartment etc.) were in good 
shape. Without much time, I took a quick look into the engine 
compartment, and - believe it or not - everything (engine, tranny etc.) was 
still in there.

The Yard (&quot;Golden State&quot;) is in California on a side road to Country Road 
102 between Davis and Woodland (Sacramento area). I will probably go back 
within the next week or so, so if anybody is interested in more 
information (please specify), i can try to find out! 

So long - have fun...
