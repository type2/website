Hi, Mark--
No, I don't broker buses very often, but there are folks I know who do.It 
might be a good idea for you to join NEATO and get connected to the 
network of enthusiasts. There's no substitute (this list is a about 300
subscribers and is hot, up-to-the minute, and very helpful. But 
the NEATO readership and larger community is over 1000, and I think there 
are hundreds of Bus People out there who will never connect up to the 
'net, but who are hardcore enthusiasts and very helpful, too). 

&gt; How is the bus scene in your area?  My sister lives near Albequerque
&gt; and I've been entertaining the notion of flying down and driving
&gt; a rust-free beauty home.

There are some rust-free beauties around, but you just can't find them 
every day. The population of New Mexico is about a million-and-a-half, 
and back in the heydays of Split Bus manufacture, there were a lot less 
people here, and they weren't too interested in foriegn cars. That said,
you can still find them, but you have to know who to ask, as there might 
be one or so evvery other week in the newspaper classifieds. And it might 
not be the one you want. Arizona is a much bigger market, but prices 
there are like California's, a tad high. But the vehicles are rust-free 
(though some can be really beat-up!). Don't believe the Hot VW's images, 
there ARE some super nice ones, but they are not the only ones--there are 
lots that are barely driveable despite their rust-free glory.

There are, however, later-models buses on just about every block here in 
the big city of Albuquerque (pop. 500,000). And there are ads for them 
every day. Good prices, too. I know, because I recently sold my '78 Westy 
for less than I paid for it (I never sold a VW for less than I paid for 
it before!). There's a lot of price resistance here, and it's tough to 
sell old cars for much. Aside from a few pockets of wealth, NM is a very 
poor state.

Anyhow, I think coming to a NEATO event and meeting people and letting 
your needs be known to all would give you an edge in finding, 
maintaining, restoring and enjoying your bus.

As for later models, I urge you to check them out, they might have what 
you want. I have a business based on renting water-cooled Vanagon campers 
here, and they're just fine.They don't have the beautiful antique 
character--words fail to describe it--of my '53 (which I use now and then to 
pick up people from the airport), but they are still nice. Any year has 
it's greater and lesser qualities. Get to know them all. 

Good Luck!

Give a call when you're in Albuquerque. I may or may not have free time, 
but if I do I can introduce you to some Bus People. . . especially if you 
come on a day when we're having our bi-monthly get-togethers.
