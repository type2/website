Subject: matte-ing gloss paint

One of the Bob Hoover articles suggests buying a black oil-based
enamel, and de-glossing it with gasoline.  Well, even though I'm
rebuidling my engine gas is a pain to get at... it doesn't drain
out of my tank readily (not to mention the 2-3 feet of snow on
the van...), nor is there a station in walking distance.

So I'm wondering if basic paint thinner (mineral spirits) will
have the same effect.  Anyone know?

Thanks!

	Gary
