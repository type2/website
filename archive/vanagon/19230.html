&gt;Rach,
&gt;The swap is possible but you have to mount the rear motor mount.There is
&gt;a kit that attaches to the oil pump (not the best way). If the case has
&gt;the mounting locations built in you can drill and tap these and the rear
&gt;mount will bolt right on.If these locations are there you can't use the 
&gt;adapter plate.you may also have trouble clearing the dual outlet tailpipes
&gt;with your bumper.Hope this helps.

Don't forget the vaccum line for the power brakes.  You'll have to use the 
bus intake manifold or get a piece of pipe welded on to the bug intake.  

As for the mounting kits, the one I got for muy bug-bus swap needed 
modification to fit.  I also had to make a spacer which looked like a oil 
pump cover 1/8&quot; thick.  Nothing a grinder and a hacksaw can't make.  

Go for it, if the engine Ric has is solid, I wouldn't hesitate.  I have yet 
to regret the swap I made.
