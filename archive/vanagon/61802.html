Subject: Re:Horsepower upgrades for 1.9 liter

Kip and others:

One easy performance upgrade to consider for a 1.9 liter is to have the
crankshaft stroked when overhauling the engine, replacing the liners with
2.1 liter pistons and cylinders, and having the camshaft reground with a
mild performance (RV) cam profile.  I did this 40,000 miles ago and have
been pleased with the results.

One big advantage is there is no conversion to do.  Also, there is no
problem passing emissions test as all modifications are internal.

Query me for more information if you are interested.
