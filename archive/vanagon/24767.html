Subject: cost of inuvik trip

Well Martha, you forgot to include the cost of showers, of course :-)


(Never mind, I'm just ticked off I cannot come :-( -- just simply
cannot afford to take a month off with 8 hungry mouths to feed and a
home mortgage to pay every month  ;-( :-( :-(  -- Inuvik trip would
have been a pilgrimage for me, I've always wated to see those places)

your friend  who owes,owes, so off to he goes,

 &gt; Thanks to the many who responded to my query about the cost, both on
 &gt; the list, as well as privately.  Estimates for gas have ranged from
 &gt; $650-$1,000, and estimates for food from $200-$800.  Either way, I
 &gt; guess Joel's got a point:  it woudln't be a bad idea to plan on allowing
 &gt; $100 per day, and that would pad things in case you needed parts, tire
 &gt; window replacements, etc.
