So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt;  Vanagon Mailing List   357 people,   328 vehicles
&gt;    46 Microbus,  123 Bus,  149 Vanagon,   10 Eurovan
&gt;    63 Unknown,    14 Wanabus
&gt; 
&gt; ok, folks. there are ENTIRELY TOO MANY Unknowns out there!!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; all i want to know is what model bus you drive/own/sleep in (and the year)
&gt; and where (country/city/state/province) you are in (or reasonably close to)
&gt; ..
&gt; 
&gt; if you do NOT have a bus but are planning on getting one in the next hundred
&gt; years, that qualifies you as a Wanabus. :)
&gt; 
&gt; thanks.

I think Joel, that if you give your email address, that the 'still-in-the-
unknown's closet' could email the info. you need without having to reveal
themselves to the list if they don't want to.
