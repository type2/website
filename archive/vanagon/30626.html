     I have 2 ham radios in my westy, 50 watts on VHF and 100 watts on 
     shortwave. I have my shortwave antenna mounted on the bumper and so 
     far (knock on wood) have had no problems.

&gt;	Besides disconnecting the battery before removing the brain box,
&gt;etc, I'd STRONGLY recomend getting a ground strap and conductive, grounded 
&gt;workplace for this kind of thing. VWs are obviously more stoutly built, 
&gt;but more than 10 Watts of radio (like Ham radio) from a vehicle mounted 
&gt;antenna blows up Toyota engine management systems. A Ham friend of my 
&gt;brother's blew-up his Camry wagon's control box and was denied
&gt;warranty coverage. A killer dose of static is easier to couple into 
&gt;a brain box when its open than RF...
&gt;
Also, there's voltage present at the tip of the soldering iron (if I remember 
correctly), so there's always the possibility of damaging sensitive 
components that are normally static sensitive.  I haven't tested the tip of 
my soldering iron personally, so don't know if this is true or not.
