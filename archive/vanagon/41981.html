Subject: FS: 66 bus in NJ
Date: 12 May 1996 19:08:04 -0400

Just took position of a 66 bus as part of a 2 car deal. Its been in a
garage since 82, does have some rust around the edges, but it is complete
and hasn't been messed with except by the deceased former original owner. 
Haven't tried to start it.  Located in Trenton NJ area.  $400.
