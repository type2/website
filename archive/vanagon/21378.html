Subject: $#%&amp;*!_at_ Shifter!  Or, Zen and the Art of Hitting Reverse

Hi All!

I don't know if this is a problem with all vanagons my model, or just
mine.  I recently bought a 1981 Vanagon L at a marshall's auction.  At
these things you keep your bids low and hope for the best, as you are only
given a few minutes to inspect the vehical prior to the auction.  And, as
most all of the vehicals were towed for not paying parking tickets, the
auctioneer doesn't have the keys (they jimmy the doors and hoods.) No
telling what nest of rats may be living in the engine (or transmission..)

So.  After purchasing this wildcard, I took it to a mechanic friend, who
got it running (just needed a new battery and some wires reconnected.) I
took it out for a spin, and the engine seems strong and servicable, and
the whole vehical drives okay.  (even rather pleasant to drive, with
decent performance.) No funny noises.  However, having not ever owned (or
driven) a Vanagon (hadda couple a beetles, few years back, seems
genetically similar), I had no experience with shifting in one. 

The only gears the shifter will go into with just forward and back
motion are 3rd and 4th.  1st and second require a bit of downward effort
and pulling to the left (as there is sort of a 'ledge' of resistance),
while pushing forward or backward for 1st or 2nd.  IOW, 1st and 2nd can't
be obtained just by bringing the shifter to the left and pushing
forward/backward. 

Reverse almost had me in tears last night, as I parallel parked in
Manhattan (had to defend my spot with New York attitude and charm). 
Hitting reverse was just pure luck, and I tried *many* variations on
force/location/direction, etc.  With the other four gears there is some
tactile feedback whereby I 'know' I've hit the gear.  Not so with reverse. 
I'd make a shift, gently ease up on the clutch, see if we were going
forward or nowhere or reverse (rare!).  I was pushing down in neutral, 
pulling over left, then up.

Eventually I got it parked.  However, I dread parking it again, until I 
figure out: a) is my vanagon behaving like all others; b1) if yes, what 
can be done to make it easier (does anyone make a shift kit?); b2) if no, 
could it be that it needs adjustment/alignment/whatever?

Is it also possible that the linkage between the tranny and shifter has 
become somehow detached or otherwise discombobulated??

I will now go meditate on the floor of my Vanagon while awaiting your wise 
answers...
