Subject: Re: Need Vanagon Tires

my favorites are 1) Sears Trailhandler in 195-70-14 LT  

                 2) Uniroyal LAREDO, same size, LT or C6 I forget

Sears was a bargain, free installation + balance at the time, good grip in 
snow/wet normal noise, no droning. Uniroyal same, more expensive though. 
Continental are like banana skins, so don't go back. I've been stuck in wet 
grassy campsites with them! Michelins are $$$ also. Like you noted, you NEED 
6ply/light truck rating, don't get talked out of it, no matter the $ saving.
Welcome to the list, know any good songs?
