Subject: Re: YES:6-ply tires and lift kits?

I had a brand new set of Radial all terrian T/A on mine when I bought 
it.  With nothing to compare them with, It's hard to say how good they 
are.  I do alot of &quot;off-roading&quot; with mine, and have been very pleased 
with it's capabilities.  I have driven up steeper hills than what was 
possible with my friends 2WD pickup.  It is really susceptable to side 
winds, but I write that off to the Westy's sleek design.  I used to run 
them at 48 P.S.I. but have settled on 38PSI.  This seems to give a better 
ride--less jarring for my in-flight refreshments.

Aren't the Synchro's a little higher off the ground?  I would like to 
get just a bit more clearance in the center, as using the center as a 
skid plate does concern me (but not enough to avoid those situations). 
Has anyone ever put a small lift kit on their van? How did it handle on 
the freeways?

                          
                               Later,
                                    Brad
