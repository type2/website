Subject: Steering work: Resolved!


Folks,
    Well, I picked up my bus from the shop last night after 10 hours of 
shear agony! It was awful. I worried all day about what those barbarians
were doing to my baby.  I didnt know these guys and yet they had their
hands all over my bus! As I picked up Amelia, I was greeted by Pete, the
shop owner who didnt want my Visa card, didnt want to talk about the 
repairs: He wanted to talk about what a great bus I had, how long I'd
had it, what to do to to keep it in good shape, all the busses he had had
in the past. We talk for half an hour before we settled the bill and said
goodby.  Last night i looked under the front and saw two shiny new tie rods
and a nice looking swing arm pin.  It drove great and I'm a happy camper!
He billed me for 6 hours labor and parts ($225) and I think that's about
right.  This place is a VW speed shop and they had all of the stuff in 
stock!  If anybody wants the name drop me a line.

PS. 
   Its almost boring now that I am not constantly correcting the steering
slop!

                                              Steve
