Subject: '82 oil plug

Someone stripped the oil plug in my '82 Vanagon and I don't want to have it
removed to change the oil until I have a good replacement. NAPA couldn't
find a replacement listed in their book. Does anyone have any good ideas as
to replacing it? There is no VW dealer here ...

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
