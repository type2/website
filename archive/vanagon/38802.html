        Hey, no fair!! Those of us on digest form get the 4-1 stuff on
4-2!! It's not April fools day anymore!!!!
        At least I didn't buy the local radio stations report that the
Space Shuttle was landing at Austin's Muller airport... Some folks actually
drove down to &quot;see&quot; the &quot;landing&quot;...  And the shuttle landed 2 days earlier
in CA...  ;-)

Peace,
