Subject: Stuft directions addendum

Adding onto Patrick (and Dave K's) fine directions:

&gt;Follow Moffet until it crosses Central Expressway.  You will now be
&gt;magically transported to the 100 block of Castro (the street changes
&gt;names at Central).  Stuft will be near the end of the block on the left.

Should you choose to approach from 101, be aware that Castro goes from 
two (2) lanes to one (1) very shortly after crossing the train tracks,
and if you want to see Stuft as Patrick describes it, you must be in 
LEFT lane, so you can continue straight on Castro.

Stuft Pizza IS at the end of the block (it's the corner building), on
the left, so unless you find street parking, my advice would be to make
a left at the light, go about a half a block until you see a little
alley/driveway on the left; turn left into it and it will lead to a 
large public parking lot behind Stuft (you can enter Stuft through the
back door too)

For you meat-eating, veggie-stomping, primal manly-men and manly-gurls,
order up a large Stromboli and have a great time, OK?  I'll be thinking
about you folks while I make polite conversation with my mother-in-law...
...sigh...I wish I could be there....YIKES!!  here she comes!  gotta go..
BYE!
