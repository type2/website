&lt;&lt; The hose connection on the plastic piece that attatches to my Westy sink

 anyone know of an after market source for this piece?  VW wants a 
 whopping $60+ for it!!  For the time being I've simply attatched the 
 drain hose directly to the drain.  Does anyone know if this may be a
problem?
 I'm trying to get everything in working order for a move west&gt;  Im not 
 sure how long I'll be living in it, so I'd like everythin nice and 
 homey-like!
 thanks!

Paul,

I found the man and company who actually makes many of these hard-to-find
parts, such as the faucet, the sunroof, outside hookup connections, etc. I
think he does the drain parts too. His prices are less than half what VW
asks.......I just replaced my faucet. He wanted $49.95, VW wanted about $95.

I think his name is Frank, but don't hold me to that.
