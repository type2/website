&gt;I was thinking that new shocks may improve the ride/handling on my '87
&gt;Vanagon GL. While browsing the Bentley manual the other day in my spare
&gt;time, I noticed that it says that you need a special tool to undo the top
&gt;nut on the front shocks. Can it really be? Have you guys successfully done
&gt;this at home in your garage (or parking lot) without the VW tool? Also any
&gt;ideas on good replacement shocks?

yup. thass right. the special tool = Sears adjustable wrench. 8&quot; or better
handle. :)  you have to hold the shaft of the shock (which has to small
flat spots on it) while you loosen/tighten the nut just below it. big deal. ;)

i've replaced my shocks on vanagons now for 15 years, so ...

now, as to the brand. :(  i kinda like Koni, but they are expensive and very
hard to find in this country nowadays. one place i found last time was a
fellow in san francisco who sold &quot;old and obselete&quot; shocks. :(  another fellow
in kentucky was willing to order them from Holland, but wanted $16 per shock
&quot;specialing ordering/handling fee&quot; ... which put them up to about $86 per.

the only other shocks i've tried were the vw/dealer shocks, and Boge (which
i didn't care for very much ... they didn't last but about 20,000 miles).

anybody ever try Monroe?  you bread-loafs are soooooo lucky, to be able to
waltz down to Poobah's Parts and get new shocks. :(  i'm wondering what the
story will be on the Eurovans when they start needing shocks.  ???
