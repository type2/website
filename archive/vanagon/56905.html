Subject: Re: Stuck Parking Brake

It has always seemed to me that &quot;just&quot; leaving the car in gear on a hill 
would be bad for the transmission in the long run.  Is this a myth?  It's 
never stopped me from doing it but it just seems like a strain on 
SOMETHING.  Kind of like putting an automatic in park and letting it roll 
forward with a jolt.

Just wondering,
Thad
