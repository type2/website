&gt;Did anyone else out there go to either (or both) of these
&gt;shows? Maybe we can swap stories (if not parts)!

I wanted to go to both Lori, but I went to Manassas instead of
Lawrence and my father came in from California last weekend so
that took care of the Woodstock show..


How were those shows
