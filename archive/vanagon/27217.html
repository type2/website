All,

Well, the camper I told you all about last week, is now mine.
It is a 79 Westy, with the complete camper package(sink, stove, fridge)
$850
Tan, with tan/brown plaid interior and extra matching carpeting ontop of the
factory installed carpet.

First the bad:

Need new clutch
Needs oil cooler work (don't know what until I drop the engine, and check it
out)
3 dents - 2 in the front above the bumper
one on the side where it looks like it was sideswiped
while someone was parking.(none of which are bad 8-)
2 pin holes in canvas, screen in canvas has small tears(really small)
Only has surface rust where the paint has been scratched
and around the windows where it usually happens

Now the good:

No rust in sliding door tracks
Interior excellent, only the kick panels need to be replaced, and the drivers
seat material is a little worn. What does one expect for a 16 year old vehicle
Everything works                            Has log book that original owner
Has childs hammock,                            kept for gas mileage/repairs,
Has table for between front seats.             and where it has been(Houston
Has privacy curtain for front windows          to Montreal Quebec)
Has curtains in all windows                 Has owners manual
Has screen for rear hatch                   Has fridge owners manual
Has Bentley manual                          95 thousand miles
Has all original records(including warranty booklet)


I took my wife along to be the negative to my positive in looking at the van,
and I ended up finding the bad things, and she found the good things.
Go figure?

At first I offered $750 and he said maybe and gave me some story about
his twin brothers wanting it (probably true, but who knows), and then I called
him today, sunday, to find out if it was still available, and he said it was
but someone else (the only other person to call) offered $850. He then
proceeded to tell me that he liked me and my wife better than the other guy
so he would rather it go to us. I then said I would pay $850 if it would
speed up the process. He readily agreed. We are the better home, we already
have a Thing to keep it company. Besides, now we can get rid of the Caravan
(yech)

Tonight we christened it with a pizza dinner on the table. I sat on the
stool making it a bit crowded, until I got the brilliant idea to turn
the passenger seat around. DOH!

Shortly we will take it camping 8-D

Cheers,

David
