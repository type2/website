Subject: Re: measuring current?
From: kdlewis_at_juno_dot_com (kenneth d lewis)

Sean:
I did some current measurements on our bus by removing the associated
fuse and attaching my probes there. When current exceeds the meter
rating I substitute a 
.1 (point one) ohm resistor for the fuse, read the voltage across it,
then multiply by ten. Remember; power= R*I^2, i.e. to measure 20 amps
the resistor should be rated at 40 amps. For making momentary readings
though, I have successfully used a fifteen watt resistor. Just monitor
the temperature (ouch) and shut her down before meltdown. A good digital
multi meter with MV range and a HOLD function helps here. I also made up
a fuse replacement with two wires coming off it for easy hook-up. 
Good Luck
