Subject: Re[2]Steve has 5 cylinders!

So then, Steven&quot;why did I get dragged into this?&quot;Johnson asks:

&gt;called truce on the saga issue Ric?  Am I wrong?  BTW, why ain't there
&gt;no EV's comin' to the West coast trips? :(


Part of the reason is that there aren't that many of 'em on the vanagon
list in the SF Bay Area; as I recall, Ric, Cetin, Pete, and Skip are back 
east, Mike B is somewhere in Texas, and here I sit out west...  
Ray Landers was on the list for a while too, but he's no longer on it.  He
was the only other EV nearby that I knew of.

Unless there are four cloaked EVs lurking on the West Coast, it's pretty 
tough for an EV to make it to a camping trip because we've got a couple 
of young kids (3.5 mos. and 21 mos.) and I don't think you folks would 
want to be subjected to what these guys can dish out.  However, if you'd
like to help babysit for a weekend and the wife and I can get that in
writing, well, now, you just might get an EV out there yet...  :-)

You know, I actually asked my SO if she'd be interested in heading out to
Bodega Bay to get her eyes pecked out for that April 9th potluck that
Martha suggested, and she sounded interested, but alas, I think the Kelly
Park(?) show kinda put the potluck into limbo (not LIMBO) land.


Anyway, this brings up a more interesting point in that I always look
forward to reading the vanagon list mail, even if it's 50-60 posts at
a time, because after a while you get to know some of the different
personalities on the list (are you reading this Mantis?), and this 
really is a *fun* list.  The combination of technical knowledge and
irreverence is pretty hard to match, and Martha pegged it with her Red 
Rock report yesterday, which wasn't so much a report as it was
an affirmation of why we're all here on this list and having a good time.

So take note Mantis (say, do you have a first name, or something, 'cuz
Mantis just doesn't have a preyer), try to relax a bit more; don't take
things too serously, and roll with the punches a little.  This list fre-
quently displays sharp, subtle wit, and it's a real joy when you can catch
it.

BTW, for you recent newbies, the /F, or /f, or [F], or [f] after the sub-
ject of a post indicates that the subject matter does not necessarily
have anything to do with a technical aspect of busses/vanagons/EVs, so it 
is therefore safe to delete such messages if you so choose, w/o reading them.
