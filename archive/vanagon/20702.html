    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Uh, I also found my die-cast Millenium Falcon but you guys probably
    &gt;&gt;wouldn't
    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;care about that.
    &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;This is also a good thing,  I just watched the triolgy on TBS last
    &gt;&gt;week.
    &gt;&gt;Supposedly Star Wars is to be rerelased in '97(20 years, yech), with
    &gt;&gt;updated
    &gt;&gt;F/X

    &gt;I heard that they are going to make the first three episodes as well.

    Supposedly they are going to make the next three chapters (7-9) into
    movies as well.

    &gt;Lee.
