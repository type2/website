&gt; Hey! That's _exactly_ why I bought it.  Who would look inside the bench
&gt; seats of a '73 VW bus for $x000 worth of photo equipment?  Plus, once I
&gt; get the curtains fixed/replaced, it will make a great changing room for
&gt; models when I'm doing model shoots!  And it has a hanging closet for the
&gt; changes of clothing.  A recent model was very envious of the 
&gt; (relatively) huge mirror I have over the sink.

Hey Patrick,
	Don't forget that you and I are the only ones with that huge
closet and mirror.  The rest of the list has to settle for the mere (gasp!)
Westfalia.  Poor souls...
