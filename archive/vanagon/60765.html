&gt;I need 6 of the little round white or ivory clips that hold on the slidi=
ng
&gt;door or rear hatch door vinyl covered wood panels on that were used in t=
he
&gt;early 80's plain Westy campers. Wally is an 84, but this interior goes b=
ack
&gt;to the first Vanagon campers. Have ordered twice from dealer and got wro=
ng
&gt;clip. Now says not available. Thanks.

I needed the same but used &quot;Rivet-Tite (tm)&quot; nylon push-in rivits from th=
e
local auto parts store instead.  The .310 inch diameter ones.  I wanted a=
nd
used black, and I don't remember seeing white or ivory ones there, but ma=

they make white also.  Good luck.
