Subject: Re:Re: ReRust Problem

&gt;Frank: do you recommend drilling strategically placed holes and spraying
&gt;in some Rust Check or equivalent or is an anti-rust paint preferable? TIA
&gt;- David
&gt;
The vanagon underside has lots of wide openings into the various box tubes 
that make up the 'frame'. 2 large spray cans of RustCheck will do this area 
+ wheel wells. As for the inside, 'just' remove all the interior panels, 
wipe down then blast with another smaller can, total cost &lt;$25Cdn. When I 
had the '85 done at RustCheck dealer (_at_$125) they only drilled 2 extra 
holes, one in each front door above the airduct. That's when I figured out 
that $25/year was better than $125/year! I power wash the bottom in late 
summer, let it dry for a couple of days, then RustCheck it. Wait another 
couple of days then apply 1-2 spray cans of underbody sealer, mostly in 
wheel wells. I figure this really soaks and seals the surface well.   So far 
so good, 9 years.  tim s.
