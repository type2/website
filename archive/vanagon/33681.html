Subject: Re: Cold Starting Question

With a carb, stepping on the acellerator before starting the engine squirts
some gas into the manifold which makes the mix fuel rich.  This aids in
starting and is similar to the way a choke works.  The choke cuts off the
air supply temporarily, making the mix fuel rich.  Once the engine warms up
the choke opens to allow the proper amount of air.  See John Muir's book
for a full explanation.


&gt;In a message dated 96-01-24 07:03:21 EST, you write:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am finding that I have a much easier time starting the Van in cold weather
&gt;
&gt;&gt;if I give the accelerator a pump before starting the engine.  I know that
&gt;&gt;most later model (all?) VWs have a choke of some sort, so it seems like this
&gt;
&gt;&gt;shouldn't be helping.  Do any of you out there pump a little on the gas
&gt;&gt;pedal before starting or I am just trying to flood my engine every morning?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a carb or fuel injection?  If it is fuel injection, contrary to
&gt;popular opinion, pushing the gas pedal half way to the floor manual sets the
&gt;cold start throttle valve in the open position.  There is not actually any
&gt;fuel being pumped since the fuel pump is electric and the ignition would have
&gt;to be turned on.  (If you listen carefully, you can hear the pump activating
&gt;when you turn on the ignition).  So to answer your question, yes it does
&gt;help, and no, you are not flooding your engine.
&gt;
&gt;If you have a carberator, none of the above applies.  I'm no expert when it
&gt;comes to carbs systems.
