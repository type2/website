I have been following the Alloy discussion closely because I too have
purchased a set of factory alloys to use on my 89 Westy. But, because
I found them at a local savage yard the lug nuts and bolts had already
been lost. At an initial investment of $300.00 for the wheels I was thinking
new dealer prices could not be that bad, right? Well for those of you who
would like to do the math - what is $8.50 * 5 * 4 ? Answer - big bucks for
lug bolts (Nuts!). And now I am hearing the studs may need replaced by
longer Studs? Does anyone know of an after-market source (or any cheaper
source of factory parts)? And will the lugs from the steel wheels fit (or not)
temporarily while I purchase one wheel a month for four months?
 I think there may be more people in this situation than myself - Can anyone
help nail this one down.
