Jon Querries re the &quot;Viking Edition&quot;&quot;
&gt;What does this constitute??


I think what the ad is referring to is VWs answer to the &quot;Eddie Bauer&quot;
edition of Ford's Bronco...in this case the Thor Hyadal (sp?) limited
edition Vanagon...

It came complete with a wood carved dragon figurehead bolted to the
front of the van...each passenger has their own helmet complete
with horns...the CD player comes pre-programed with only ONE
CD...Wagner's Die Valkerie....and for additional
gas mileage there is a mast and sail arangement that can be
raised to take full advantage of tail winds...

According to &quot;Rodent Track&quot; (the magazine of the rat race) the
sail can, with sufficient tail wind, blow that sucker clear up
a 30% incline.
