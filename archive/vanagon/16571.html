Subject: re: sagging rear on 71 bus


When I purchased my 71 westy (some years ago now - its long since 
moved on to yet another happy camper) it was fitted with air shocks 
in the rear, KYBs in front. I found this to be a great combination. 
When it came time to gear up for a Baja surf trip, and the westy was 
packed with muchos surfboards, sixpacks, gallons of fresh water and 
other weighty stuff, I'd just stop off at a gas station and put some 
air in via a schrader (sp?) valve mounted inside the engine 
compartment. This would put the hind-end up high and firm, just the 
way they should be. After the trip, I'd let out some air, and be 
back to a standard, more comfortable ride. Although I didn't install 
the air shocks myself, it doesn't look like much of a problem. As I 
recall, they had Sears labels on 'em.
