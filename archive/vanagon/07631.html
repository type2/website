There was a lenghty discussion of this in July and August, but basically
it comes  down to three things: a) insulation and sealing of  bus shell,
including curtains and fibreglas stuffed virtually everywhere; b)
auxiliary heaters - in various forms and guises; c) improvement on
existing heating system. I just drove down to Toronto and back this week
and temps have been hovering just around the 40 degree mark - with the
existing system these temps are ok. Here is what I have done - installed a
booster fan in line with the heater and insured that the heater boxes are
fully functional and sealed. This works even at temps below -10 C.

I have a pretty good idea why VW never installed an in line booster fan
with the heater box system even though it makes a lot of sense: if there
is the slightest leak in the heater system; ground air and exhaust can be
pulled through the system - a potentially  dangerous situation - if a leak
develops. The
alternative - having a fan at the rear pushing air through ensures that
there will be high pressure throughout the system and leaks will be less
crucial. This means though that you will never have high heat at idle or
low revs, thus the booster fan - JC Witless has them as do others.

Since it is likley the Westfalia will go in storage for the winter (rust
problems up here don't you know), the issue of heat at temps below -10 are
of only theoretical interest to me. 

PS we just had it Rust Checked and it is now thoroughly soaked in oil,
guaranteed not to rust.....DC
