Subject: Golf Syncro ? ? ?

Driving around town today I came across an A2 bodied VW Golf Syncro - jacked
up ~ 6&quot; higher than normal, with  serious 'roo/brush bar assemblys front &amp;
rear, outside rear mounted spare, lotsa extra *big* lights front &amp; rear -
looked like it was all ready for Paris-Dakar !  Anybody have any info ? ?
(&amp; yes I know,where's the Vanagon thread; well, the word Syncro &amp; maybe the
fact that it's water-cooled ? ? ).

Austin
