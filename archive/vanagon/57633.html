Hey,
For the plastic covers on the outside electrical and water access try:

Euro-American RV Products
(818)760-4214
You can leave a message or call him between 9am and 11 am PST M-F when he's 
actually in the office.  This guy has almost everything you'll need to 
restore a Westy including the pieces you require (no curtains).  He was 
the original supplier for the VW on these Westy pieces.

Good luck,

Perry
