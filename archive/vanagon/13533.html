Subject: :)  Jettas.

H. Steven was responsible for a tirade against the modern beetle.

Steven - we might have a row about this ...

&gt;Now I don't have anything against the jetta, or any other water cooled VW 
&gt;for that matter, but to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen &quot;I've owned a beetle 
&gt;and that's no beetle&quot;.  While so many of us airheads are slavering for 
&gt;beetles even to the point of dreaming about smuggling one up from Mexico, 
&gt;to have VW throw this (or the &quot;Concept 1&quot;) sop to us is a dead flat 
&gt;insult.  The essence of aircooled VW's was that they were cheap, easy to 
&gt;fix, reliable, and fun to drive.  While the jetta may be fun to drive, 
&gt;and I have no data on reliability, it ain't  cheap and I doubt you can 
&gt;get the engine out and up on the bench in 45 minutes. In my book, the day 
&gt;they deleted the hole for the crank was the day they went too far.

I have been the proud owner of (in total) three Volkswagens, two of which
were Jettas.  They were the sexiest, coolest, most fantabulous things on the
road.  Gizmo, my first ever car, was an '87 1.3 petrol-burner which I
adored.  The day I pancaked it into a wall was probably the worst in my
entire life.

I replaced it with the black thing, a '90 1.3 petrol-burner which I also
adored.  The day I pancaked it into a ditch was probably the worst in my
entire life.  And the day that a drunk driver (female) totalled it while it
was parked outside my front door was probably the worst in my entire life.

Leave Jettas alone.  They mean a lot to me.

BTW, the current model is called the Vento here.  I hate it.
