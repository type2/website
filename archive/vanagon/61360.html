After many months of study, pondering, frustration, and fidgeting with my   
refrigerator, I've come to the conclusion that I NEED HELP!

 I have an 83 Westy with a burdening fridge.  The 120V heater will cool   
the refrigerator adequately but the gas wont.  The gas burner will get   
the chimney much hotter than the 120V heater element but the fins in the   
box don't cool with gas.
 As you can see my problem isn't that my burner wont light.  There is   
something else.  The refrigerator is level.  As I cried before, PLEASE   
HELP!
