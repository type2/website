&gt; 
&gt; QUESTIONS:
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else had problems like this?
&gt; 
&gt; Any idea why or how it happens?
&gt; 
&gt; Any idea about what I can expect from the dealer or VW USA?

Yeah... I had the same problem.  It sounded like I had a flat tire.  I
took it back to the dealer who could not find a problem.  I eventually
bought new tires.  The problem went away.
