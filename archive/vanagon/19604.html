So IMRallyist_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; When I go to drive it, what specific things should I look for?  What are '84
&gt; Vanagons known for having problems with?
&gt; 
&gt; The asking price is $6500, which seems a bit high, but this is the Seattle
&gt; area.  What do you think of the price?

YOUCH!!!  $6500.  For that price, you should be looking for gold bars under
the bench and in the cabinet!  ;)  Sounds to me like the seller is trying
to recoup their $$$$ losses on repairs. :(  I'd keep looking.  For 6500,
the interior/exterior should be emaculate and you've already stated enough
to the contrary.  See rust spots. :)

&gt; I plan on driving across the mountains, so power, handling, and braking will
&gt; need to be at their best.  What modifications/additions can I make to improve
&gt; these?  Will parts from later models fit (i.e., wider alloy wheels, largers
&gt; brake discs)?

I wouldn't do anything to change the stock system.  If it needs a brake job
then get it done.  If your dying for more power, then get a Porsche engine
put in (big bucks).   But I don't think it's worth it unless you've got
the money.  Besides, what's wrong with going slow and enjoying the scenery?

It's your money,
