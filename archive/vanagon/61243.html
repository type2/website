Subject: A/C fan switch removal, how?

A/C fan switch only seems to work on the highest setting, so I want 
to check the contacts.  

Is there an easy way to remove this rotary switch (driver's side)
without dropping that whole tunnel assembly?  If not, is that 
procedure in Bentley or has anyone had to do this?  Maybe Erik, if 
you've taken the A/C out of that parts van.
