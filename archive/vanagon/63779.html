Subject: alloy wheels





i am sure that the old hands are tired of this subject,  but for those
of you thinking about alloy wheels for your vanagon,  the following is
a summary of what it involved for my 91 syncro:
10 mm wheel spacers in cast aluminum from nu-way service center
(908-925-7700) _at_ $8.95 each
86 audi turbo quattro alloys 5 x 112 from j &amp;v auto salvage
(516-283-5111) ask for kevin....price on these is probably dependant
on supply at the time and condition of the wheels.  many thanks on
this front to ronald turner,  who's posting in the archives contained
an excellent list of which wheels fit the vanagon.
porsche 911 wheel studs from partsheaven (800-767-7250),  i called
everywhere for these and partsheaven guys were the most helpful and
cheapest! around $4-5.00 each.  you must replace all of the studs, 
and/or wheelbolts if you are using spacers for front and rear.  even
though the wheels fit the rear w/o spacers,  if you do not use them in
the rear the track will be different from front to back.   this
doesn't look too good to me but i don't know if it will matter.
you must change the studs to give the lug nuts sufficient thread to
grab!  i paid a local shop to change the studs.  the old ones didn't
really want to go, so i'm glad that i paid the $90.00 (remember, i
live in ny).
i refinished the wheels myself- med. scotchbrite, silver alloy wheel
paint from griot's garage (worth the extra $), then #0000 steel wool
and wax.
to get the center caps to fit over the rear axle nut,  cut 1/2 inch
from the steel retaining ring on the cap and then tap on with a rubber
mallet.
i am currently running pipelli scorpion a/s 215/75-15's w/ no
clearance problems whatsoever.  i have not noticed any loss of power
due to the larger tires.  if anything,  the magic bus rides much
better then with the dunlops and it actually gets 1-2 more mpg.
the tires give me about 1 inch more ground clearance.  btw, i used the
stock lug nuts with no ill effects....
any questions,  feel free to email me
