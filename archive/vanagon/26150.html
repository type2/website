Subject: Still Smell Coolant

Those of you who have endured my questions on leaks in the heating system 
might be interested to know that my 85 camper sprung a leak in one of the 
large metal coolant tubes, ruined a head, and had to be towed back and 
the head replaced.

It seems to run fine, now.

However, I can still (as in before the overheating) smell coolant in the 
passenger compartment.

I do not think it comes from the rear heater.  That used to leak but is 
repaired and shows no signs at all of leakage.

So!  My question is, does anyone have any good techniques for finding a 
coolant leak that so far shows itself only by the odor?  I'm finding no 
leakage anywhere.

The system seems to hold pressure pretty well, which should mean the leak 
is minimal.  But maybe I'm paranoid.  

My concern is that if it smells, there is a leak, and if there is a leak, 
at a minimum, air is being pulled back into the coolant system on 
cool-down which means both that air pockets will form and coolant will be 
displaced.  In other words, the same condition that has given me problems 
before.
