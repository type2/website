Subject: OLD Busses   (3, or so....)

FWIW, back in '70/'73 college days, I had a 1965 bus with a Corvair 
engine.  Rebuilt the front end, put on a &quot;camber compensator&quot; on the
rear transaxle and (biggest help) put on 6&quot; wheels and 205 or 215 tires.
Used to cruise from Dallas to Houston _at_ 75 or 80 with no handling 
problems except in high winds.  Unfortunately, because of the Corvair,
I felt personally responsible for the 73 oil shortage.  I probably put 
as much oil back on the ground in Texas as ever was pumped out.
