    Sad to see this day but a friend of mine is giving up on his
    Vanagons. He gave me the word today they are for Sale:
      1986 Syncro: AC Lock axil
      No motor 
      Transmission needs repair (I have the parts)
      many parts in need of repair: blown AC line, ignition switch
      bad, Rear hatch struts dead, PS pump shot etc. 
      Body in good condition.
      WE drove it home 9 months ago.   

      1987 VAnagon GL: auto. AC  
      Very clean
      Interior almost perfect
      Body almost perfect
      Motor has bad connecting rod rap, oil light on.
    
         Asking  $1500 Each. Located in PGH. PA
     
      IF this doesn't work they will become donors. I would love to fix 
      them but I got my hands filled now!
