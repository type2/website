Subject: RE: The Forever Car (or Why Trade It In?)

With regard to the book &quot;Why Trade It In?&quot;, I can recommend a couple of
other books you may find interesting:

The Geography of Nowhere : the rise and decline of America's man-made
landscape / James Howard Kunstler, Simon &amp; Shuster, 1993
ISBN 0-671-70774-4
usually indexed under: Architecture - Environmental Aspects - United States

this a description of the history of urban/suburban landscape, and
discusses the role that the automobile has played in its formation.

Regarding wasting money on buying cars (and consumption in general) you might
want to check out:
Your money or your life : transforming your relationship with money and
achieving financial independence; Joseph R. Domingueze and Vicki Robin;
Viking Penguin, 1992.
ISBN 0-670-84331-89
usually indexed under: Finance, personal.

This book is nowhere near as hokey as its title may make it sound. The
basic thesis is: you spend too much time earning money you don't really
need - and by evaluating how your time and money are spent you can get by
on a lot less while having more time. Of course as an investment choice he
recommends 30 year Treasuries, returning all of about 6% right now I think!
