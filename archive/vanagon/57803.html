Subject: It RUNS, It RUNS!

Finally, my van is running again since Christmas!  Thanks to those of you who
gave me feedback about pulling the other head to check its gaskets.  

I ended up taking the suggestion of someone (can't remember who) and pulled
the pluges from the passenger side to see if I had the same syptoms of a
blown internal head gasket. Everything looked fine on the passenger side, so
I only opened up the driver side head.  Sure enough, the on of the thin green
o-rings was blown.  

Replaced it and reinstalled everything.  Started up and everything rang
great.  Wife and child had a wonderful trouble free 400 mile trip this
weekend.

Thanks again for all the advice and feedback.
