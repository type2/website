Subject:  Re: Gallons to litres 

I am up here in Canada, and we pump gas in litres not gallons.
So, my question is, how many litres to a gallon so I can figure out my
mileage compared to some of you?

Also, is there any way you can tell what your compression ratio is without
taking the heads off and measuring this and that?

Answer:

4.54 litres/imperial gallon
6/5 US gallons/ Imperial gallon
1 US Gallon = 3.77 litres.

Bill Crick
76 type II with 0.529 US gallon engine.

&quot;How much is that in REAL MONEY&quot;
