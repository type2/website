Subject: re: Summary of Vanagon group names /L

&lt;snip names of people on the vanagon list&gt;

Don't forget:

Vanagonites

Vanagonians

Busboys(girls) - like in restaurants, the ones who clean tables

Bus-hido - The chivalric code of the samuri of feudal Japan, emphasizing
loyality and courage and death to dishonor (that describes us about our
brick shaped vehicles)

bus-ker - a strolling entertainer - (that is about the speed we move,
and we certainly entertain at least children)

I'm sure there are more, but I can't think right now as it is friday

Cheers,

David
