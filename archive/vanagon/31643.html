Subject: /f NYE Resolution (was Re: love our &quot;bricks&quot; so much?)

&gt;world, keeping an early van alive will be a snap.  But the cost of owning a
&gt;water-cooled van or one having the Type IV engine has been rising steadily.
&gt; Many loyal owners will be forced to abandon their vehicles due to economic
&gt;factors.  

    With this in mind, I resolve to locate and purchase 
    a '71 against the day the '76 cannot be patched back
    together...
