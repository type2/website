Subject: RE: 81 Westfalia Blues

Bob Park considers Mazdafying his 81 Westy.  As long-time Vgon-listers know,
I am a big fan of Vgon engine conversions, but my recommendation is air for
air, water for water.  My 81 Vgon is happy with a Porsche six, altho your
Westy might not be: for Porsche engines before 1982 (ie for Porsche engines
humans can afford) you need to raise the Vgon engine lid by about 5 inches,
which could make the Westy bed uncomfortable.

Hope your engine nightmare is over now.
