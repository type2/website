Subject: Re: VW Alloy Wheels

I don't know exactly how far the studs extend beyond the alloy wheel, I
never even thought about them being too short. The alloys are machined
around the lug holes for a special conical, not round lug nut. Consequently,
they aren't all that thick at that point, maybe 3/16&quot; or 1/4&quot; (from memory).

You will need to get a special (ie expensive) set of lug nuts (and bolts if
not a syncro) for the alloys. Weren't alloys a dealer option? It's hard to
imagine that they would have to replace the studs to install the optional
wheels. I purchased my alloy wheels from a VW dealer and was told I could
just put them right on--they never mentioned anything about replacing the
studs. 

Have you tried fitting your alloy wheels to see if the studs are long enough?

&gt;This is interesting.  Perhaps all syncros come with the longer studs?  Out
&gt;of curiosity how far do your studs extend beyond the alloy wheel?  I would
&gt;LOVE to not have to replace the studs!  TIA
