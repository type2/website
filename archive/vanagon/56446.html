Subject: Re: lowest mileage

Hey troops the early year '83 Aircooled Westy that Paula and I bought had
bonified 23,800 miles on it when we nabbed it two years ago this Spring.
Two points:
1. The odo/trip broke a month following the purchase that made me say Hmmmmm...
 The bus did look like new when we bought it. Still had the blue plastic on
the drain pan over the stove and most everything else looked near perfect
outside of the things mentioned in my second point.

2. I agree with &quot;Coyote&quot; Ron. The things need to be used. My point is that
all of the items that have been replaced were defective from *lack* of use
and dried up in the Desert heat. (Wall paper effect, overflow tank and
grommets, misc squeaky suspension rubber bushings, whatever.
