&gt; Good choice Harry; I've had a couple of Interstates in the past and they
&gt; offer greater cca, serviceability, 60 mo warranty, and a pretty competitive
&gt; price.  They're not necessarily well known, but I think it's a very good
&gt; product.

&gt; That's my $0.02 worth...

I 2nd this advice, on the basis of our friends at Consumer Reports.  They 
tested 'em all, and Interstate (if I remember right) was the top-rated 
battery, all-around.  I put a 650CCA Interstate in my Jetta to replace 
the dilapidated Autobahn, which constantly leaked (only 2 1/2 years, 60K 
miles).  So far, the Interstate, well, works fine (don't ever notice 'em 
unless they don't, no?).
