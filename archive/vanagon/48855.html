Subject: Seeking good Vanagon service in the Boston area.

Howdy,

We live in Winchester and are looking for a good place to take our 1990
Vanagon GL for service.  We tried to use Greg Malany at Moody Street Mobil
(Waltham), who advertises in the Limbo newsletter but we were told he has
move on to some place in Cambridge.  Anyone know where he went?? Or can
anyone recommend someone else.

Thank you in advance,

Robert Grobe
