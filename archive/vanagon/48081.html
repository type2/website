Subject: Shameless VolksMotorsports plug


to All:

my search for a BN4 heater ended with Kyle of VolksMotorsports
approaching me with one they had.  the heater's condition was
accurately described, a price set, and it arrived on the day Kyle
said it would.  one can't ask for a better long-distance (Calif. to
Minn.) experience.  Kyle even responded well to my barrage of 
questions to determine if it was the metering type!

living in a rural area of a state not known for its preponderance of
25 year old VW parts, i truly appreciate a mail order vendor that is
reputable. thanks, Kyle.
