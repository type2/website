&gt; My questions are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Has anybody else noticed this? Any suggestions for improving this
&gt; situation?

	In my '91, I always used the shorter up front for both food preparation
counter and computer table with passenger seat swiveled.
	
	I had food stuffs in the top-loaders, so the table was outa the way anyway
	as I was using it as a food prep counter or food-eater 	table. I often had
to ask food-eater sitting on the bench to pass the can of lentil soup etc..
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Where and how is that smaller table supposed to be stored for travel?
&gt; I see in the owners manual how it is set up for use but there is no
&gt; picture for where it belongs during travel..

	I always plopped it on the back of the upper bed. Usually, anytime I
needed the small table I was also popping the top. But, then I'm 74&quot; long.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
