Subject: Vanagon Speakers

&gt;I have a 86 Vanagon and the front speakers are blown. The trick is the
&gt;speaker plate has to be flush on the interior door so the window crank can
&gt;work (all other speakers I can find have a raised speaker plate about 1/4
&gt;to 1/2 inches). Any thoughts on replacements?
&gt;


&gt;The simplest solution - take each handle off and bend it (actually &gt;the
internal alloy part slightly!      The plastic cover snaps back on &gt;and looks
fine (my opinion).   Cheap fix, too.  I've done this with two &gt;vans and 4
handles so far, with good results.

I just had a problem with the driver side speaker of my syncro.  It ended
being a short in one of the speaker wires.  Anyway, i did buy a new set of
pioneer speakers for the fornt and they fit pretty good, sound alot better
too.  I did have to bend the window crank a bit to clear it. ( the speaker
sits out approximately 1/4&quot;).  The key is to position the speakers as far as
possible forward so that the crank handles only need a little tweaking.  So
much for OEM.
