Subject: clakity clak clak 4th cylinder 30 psi

Hi all.  I have a 80 vanagon with a new ominous claking sound . The
compression is as follows. Cylinders 1-3 are at 90 psi, the 4th is 30-40
psi. The engine is a gex remanufactured one and it is about 9000 miles
new(?). Would a stuck valve lifter cause this, or is it as bad as it
sounds. Has anybody had any dealings with gex honoring their warranty?

Thanks, Rudy B. Santa Rosa, CA
