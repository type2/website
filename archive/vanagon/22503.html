&gt; Hey:
&gt; 
&gt; Well the time to move out to calif. is soon upon us and we realized 
&gt; we had nowhere to put the bikes. My question is, is there a bike rack 
&gt; that we can use for the Vanagon (84). I looked at the top mounted 
&gt; racks, but they were tooo expensive (or I'm too cheap) and the 
&gt; thought of battling Midwestern Wind gusts with an extra 3 feet of 
&gt; &quot;Sail&quot; didn't sound to  good. Area there any that will fit on the 
&gt; hatch area?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Matt

Well, not necessarily cheap, but great fit, great looking and sturdy 
enough to take your house along with:  the Paulchen rack (made in Germany) 
is beautifully crafted and well thought out.  Basically a utility rack, it 
also has attachments for carrying bikes, skis, etc.  They used to be 
handled by several local Pacific Northwest VW dealers, such as Campbell 
Nelson, Carter, but were dropped a couple of years ago.  Still, you 
may be able to find them from another source, or even, if you get lucky, 
used, somewhere.
