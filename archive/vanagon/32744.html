Subject: Re:  More Possum

&gt;Best possum recipe &quot;Ernest T's Possum and Sweet Taters&quot;

&gt;1 1/2 pound baking potato
&gt;1 young possum (2 1/2 lbs) Dressed
&gt;4 tsp Salt
&gt;3/4 tsp black pepper
&gt;1/8 tsp red pepper
&gt;3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
&gt;2 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled

You know, just the other day I was in a restaurant and order some possum.  
The food was so great I asked if I could buy the recipe.  The waiter 
said,&quot;Sure, no problem.  It's only two-fifty&quot;.  

Well, when I got my visa bill, and saw they charged me $250, boy was I 
pissed.  

And now I see that you had the recipe all this time:)
(It's still sorta Friday)
