&gt; Hi Gang:

&gt; Well, after 2000 km in my new EV Winnebago, I
&gt; am pained to tell the list that the heating
&gt; and defrosting is horrible.  We went skiing
&gt; yesterday (-20 C a.m., -14 C p.m.) and spent
&gt; the three hours of driving, scraper in hand,
&gt; just like the old beetles we had.

&gt; P.S.  Please don't gloat - and no &quot;I told you so&quot;s.

&gt; Dan

My wife ('73 Super Beetle driver) was reading over my
shoulder when this came up on my screen.  Her response was
that it was about time that VW went back to the basics that
made them a legend.  Could this be it? Huh? Huh?
