Subject: Re: trip odometer - problem solved?

My husband and I pulled the odometer/speedometer out of the '81 'Falia and
tinkered with it tonight.  Surprisingly, all of the cogs and gears seemed
to be intact.  The gears were sticking, though.  So we turned them several
times and then greased them up until they appeared to turn more smoothely.
We put the instrument panel back together and then hit the road.  For the
moment it seems to be working fine!  We'll keep our eyes on it, but it
looks promising.

If anyone needs advice on dismantling a VDO odometer from an early '80s
vanagon, I'd be happy to give it.  There are a few tricks involved.

Thanks to all who sent me advice!
