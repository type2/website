&gt; Help!
&gt; We have some really old crappy stickers on our pop out window (pre us ie over
&gt; 20 years old). We want to remove but are seeming impossible. They seem to be
&gt; some kind of plastic and only the  surface comes off mm by mm leaving
&gt; gunk/smear.
&gt; I am afraid of using a scraper in case of scratching the glass. Anyone got any
&gt; ideas?

A single-edge razor blade (make sure it is sharp or new) works very 
well. You need to keep it as flat to the glass as you can and take your 
time. All remnants of those old stickers will soon be gone.

&gt; Of course if they were Grateful Dead stickers that'd be alright!

Careful, that Grateful Dead issue is a touchy subject around here. Of 
course if you're a deadhead you can use that razor you use for 
separating cocaine to scrape your windows, too ;)
