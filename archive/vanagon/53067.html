Subject: Re: Silicon oil in Syncros viscous coupling

Nobody has ever heard about anybody changing the oil, although somebody from
South Africa asked just this same question to us about 6 months ago nobody
knew the answer. It sounds like the answer is to find Visco Drive. I'll do a
search for them.

Alta Vista turns up somebody called Schumacher Visco Drive at
http://ally.ios_dot_com/~millha19/schumacher/viscous.html but closer inspection
reveals this is viscous coupling for toy race cars (really!).

Euroseek turns up nothing for Visco Drive.

There is a Austrian white page telephone listing at www.atp.at/herold/ but
when I tried it the atp.at server was down so maybe somebody else can try it
or you will have more luck accessing from France.

There is also a German Yellow pages at www.gelbe-seiten_dot_de/ but I couldn't
figure out how to search for &quot;Visco Drive&quot; because the site is all in
German, which I cannot read.

The rest of Europe appears to be at http://206.129.166.101/intl/int.html but
I think some body needs to submit &quot;Visco Drive&quot; who has broader language
skills than I have.

&gt;Hello Guys,
&gt;
&gt;As I wrote in my last mail, a lot of Syncroists in the Club are very
&gt;interested in how to get theirs Syncros fixed because as they get olders
&gt;(the vans, not the owners...), some of them have viscous coupling problems
&gt;and, of course, turbo diesel engines. And as you surely know, the VW dealers
&gt;prices for parts and repairs are fairly expensive in our country.
&gt;
&gt;So that's why we would be very interested in finding correspondants in
&gt;Germany for all these kinds of problems.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you'll be able to help me out about a question :
&gt;
&gt;Viscous coupling : They are built in a company called Visco Drive, but I'm
&gt;not sure whether it's in Germany or Austria. The fact is, when they break,
&gt;it's usually only a matter of silicon oil, they are OK mechanically, but the
&gt;company doesn't want to tell which kind of oil it is. Just go to the VW
&gt;dealer and get a new visco for about $3100 in France. Kind of expensive
&gt;oil... Any idea about this? If we'd know about this oil, problems would be
&gt;fixed. Only need to remove one screw, change the old oil and that's it! How
&gt;do we found out about this? One of the Club's member got one from a wreck
&gt;and put it on his Syncro. After that he opened the old one, everything,
&gt;discs included was OK except the oil. It seemed that there was a kind of
&gt;rusty greasy liquid instead of clean silicon. If someone knows exactly about
&gt;this oil caracteristics, it'll be very helpful for all Syncro's addicts and
&gt;save big bucks!! We're still working on it.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
