Subject: 1966 Westfalia for 500 bucks

I would like to hear out your opinoins about this bus that I am not sure if 
the price is resonable!
The bus's conditon is pretty good, no dent, or bump noticed unforunate 
the floor pan needs to be restored badly. The camper material like bed, 
ref, sink, table, and closet are not included. So do you think 500 is a 
good deal?
