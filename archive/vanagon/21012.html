Someone around here once mentioned that they use a Honda motorcycle 
fuel filter on their VW.  It had a metal body and a replaceable 
element.  This sits inline.  I was wondering if someone had a part 
number or similar from another source before I wonder into a 
motorcycle shop and start asking dumb questions.  I would really like 
to get a hold of one of these.  That little plastic thing I have been 
using just doesn't seem too safe anymore.  Also, to those who actually
put this outside of the engine compartment:  where exactly do you put 
it on a bus?  I mean I could put it right about where the fuel comes 
out of the tank or I could put it over closer to where the metal line 
goes into the engine compartment.  One doesn't really seem easier to 
get to than the other.  Is one is a little safer?  Thanks, Jim
