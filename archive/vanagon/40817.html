Subject: '59/'63 buses for sale

on the way to the merle watson festival this weekend, i saw a '63 and '59 van,
both for sale. both were rusted fairly well, ie, rocker panels had holes in it.
the '59 was interesting, no rear windows, only windows on the back door. don't
have a number or anything, but they are located between winston-salem and
wilkesboro on 421..it was pouring and my girlfriend was bewildered as to why i
was standing in the cold rain looking at them.
