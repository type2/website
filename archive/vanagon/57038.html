&gt;still a real damn appealing price, want

Well, if I knew that these tanks never fail, I'd sell
my extra one. :-). 

These syncro gas tanks are some sort of high density plastic, 
I'll bet a leak could be repaired with the right technique.

Regardless, I will publicly admit that I have an extra Syncro
gas tank, and if anyone gets serious about this vehicle, we could
talk.
