Of course you owners of 83.5-86s would know better than I, but I've test driven 
both an 85 GL and a Westy that had the plastic engine covers on them.  I 
suspect that VW made the change on the 83.5 year model in which they changed to 
the Wasserboxer.

&gt; &gt;I was looking for new pad that covers the engine and completes the lower
&gt;  &gt;bed in my Camper.  Any suggestions?
&gt;  
&gt;  Try to get a pad from a Diesel where available. They are made of plastic
&gt;  and not as heavy as the steel ones. I guess they will be reduce the
&gt;  engine noise better because the  denoiser is glued onto it. I used the
&gt;  plastic to raise a part of the lid. I will send you part# if required.

I believe the original request was concerning the bed cushion that can be
placed on top of the engine compartment, not the engine lid itself.  I'd hate
to sleep on a steel one!   :)

Concerning the engine lid though, all later models (87+) I've seen came wth
the plastic lid, while and 82 diesel's I saw came with the heavy metal lid.
 I think VW changed over sometime between 82 &amp; 86 from metal to plastic on
all the lids.

Does anyone know when this change was made?
