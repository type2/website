Subject: Re: '71 &amp; '79 Seat Interchangeability

I replaced the seats in my 70 westy with a pair of 78 seats so you should
have the same task. The drivers side goes right in with no work at all,
the passengers side is different
on the later bus models there is a swivel thingy so the seat can be made to
face sideways with a round plate underneath.
I removed the runners from that and spot welded them in place and voila the
new seats were in.
there is one drawback:
the kiddie bunk that fits across the front will not go in until you remove
the headrests, but that is no biggie!

have fun we feel much better with headrests even if they are not original,
is this as bad as cutting flares in pre 68 rear wheel wells???
