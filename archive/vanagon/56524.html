Subject: Re: Lighter tyres for lighter steering?

an interesting side note...

	the Contact patch of the tire in this size range(185R-14 to 205/70R-14)
remains constant...

	you go to a &quot;wider&quot; tire the contact patch is  wider from side to side,
but shorter front to back.  This in turn gives you more resistance to
side loads (handling &quot;feels&quot; more precise...)

	Learned this interesting little fact at a Michelin Tire school...
