Subject: 75 Bus &amp; strange smell...

Hi all, After my breakdown a few weeks ago, it took me a couple weeks to
feel okay and get my bus back on the highway. I had driven about 120 miles
or so, when I noticed the smell of sulfur wafting up through the defrost
vents. I had someone tell that it's a good idea to run some heat in hot
weather to draw hot air away from the engine (true? legend?).

Anyway, I didn't have any other problems; in fact it ran great, but I'm a
little nervous about *that smell*...

Any advice??? TIA


Wendy
