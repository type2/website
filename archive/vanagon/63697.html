I've been living in Halifax, Nova Scotia for 2 years now.  We (my wife
and 2 kids) just bought a Westy and have recently started enjoying the
many parks, beaches, country roads of the Atlantic provinces.
It's a beautiful part of the world.

I'm glad you enjoyed your trip.        Chris - '84 Westy &quot;Gromit&quot;
