Subject: Re: Camper Conversions

&gt;I have a '73 1600cc type II bus, and would like to know what sort of 
&gt; conversion it is (devon, westfalia(?))
&gt;
&gt;What points are specific to each type of camper conversion?

The easiest way to tell is by looking at the pop-top (if its got one). Can
you describe how long it is and which way it hinges, and if there are any
windows or vents in the top. The seating arrangement and how you make up the
bed are also good pointers. If it's a Devon there'll be a sticker behind the
passenger seat that says so and if it's a Westfalia there'll be a plate next
to the VIN number behind the driver's seat, I don't know about other makes.
