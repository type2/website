Subject: Re: throw out bearing



  The part # for the Vanagon TO bearing is,113 141 165b.  Those of us that
are familiar with VW part #'s know that this IS the same as a 71 and up BUG
TO bearing too.  

  I've never had a problem with any of these, I do only install and sell
German TO bearings as opposed to a Brazilian bearing.  I've seen the
Brazilian bearings fail in a quick amount of time.

  Make sure the collar looks good and that the bearing slides Smoothly on
the sleeve Prior to re-installing the trans :)
