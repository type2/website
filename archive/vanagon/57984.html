Subject: Early wESTY SOLID TOP REPLACEMENT, AS IN HIGH TOP

     
Has anyone ever replaced the aftermarket Westy &quot;high Top&quot; solid non
collapsing roof with a lower fiberglass two piece conventional  top with
the canvas sides? The reason is the current top will not fit under my new
garage door frame. while a conventional one in the down position will.
These were offered in Canada by a company called GET AWAY.
Thanks In advance

     Sid Clarke
