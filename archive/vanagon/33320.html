Subject: Expansion Tank vs. Main Tank vs. Refill Tank

Let's get our nomenclature straight here.  I think that the Expansion Tank
on a Vanagon is, in fact, the main tank--the one with the pressure cap and
fill level sender attached to it.  The tank that is accessible from the
license plate frame is the Refill Tank.  Since there is not a fill point on
the radiator of most newer VW models, what would be called the Main Tank is
not available to pour anything into (unless you want to pump it into the
radiator through the bleed screw fitting).

Bars Leak will not work properly if you pour it into the refill tank, not
enough of it gets into the main cooling system quickly enough to do the job.
Pour it into the Expansion Tank--I used AlumaSeal and it has taken care of
my leak so far!
