My Van( I am wishing it wasn't lately)
started dumping far, far too much fuel into the cylinders
one day about 2 months ago.  I got it back to school somehow,
changed to oil and plugs, drove to the bike trails and barely
made it back home.
 
Something is making the fuel injection do &quot;bad things&quot;.
I checked for a shorted wiring harness, my cold start valve
is disconnected and doesn't leak, it has new points, etc.
 
Two possibilites are this:
1) injectors short when its wet outside.  The problem ioriginally
started on a rainy day, but continued into the dry....
 
2) I got a &quot;new&quot; airflow sensor in Feb.  The resistances don't
check out as per Bentley. I popped it open to find out that
Beck-Arnley's idea of a rebuild is ghoi is doing the exact same thing I did
to milk my other one along (bend the wiper arms to a new spot).
I am going back to the Autpo
FLAPs monday...
 
3) (I thought of an extra one) Fuel Pressure.  I still can't
get ahold of a pressure checker to test this, but I think it would
have to be way, way high to be doing this.
 

I am at wits end, almost.  All I ever wanted was to be able to
drive something once a month. Its enough to want to go to carbs...
 
thats my story...it doesn't have a point, other than I am not
happy about getting ganked on a $150 part that I can't find the invoice
for and I really need to get this fixed so I can move at the end of
July....
 
Regards,
Matt
