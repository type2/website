Hey Scott

I need a project....How much you want for it???(HA HA)  

Now comes the real question that will prove what kind of a man you really are!!!

I think you know the answer...You can sleep with your girlfriend....but you
can sleep in your WESTY!

Sorry---Hope no one was offended by this but I could not resist.

Joe

&gt;For those who remeber, Last week my vanagons fuel gauge stopped
&gt;working so I ran out of gas (didn't know this until I was towed to my
&gt;mechanic and he dertimed the problem).  Well, I picked up the van,

&gt;My girlfriend is  telling me to 'throw that damn thing away'
(how could she!!)
 since I've had to put in clutch, trans, gas gauge out, and now this in the
last two months.
&gt;And that hurts!
