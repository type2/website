&gt;Doesn't seem to leak much.  I assume 1 or 2 drops a minute while driving.

&gt;What is the diagnosis??  Head gasket?  

You've got to find out exactly where the leak is coming from before you can
diagnose this problem. Get a flashlight. Remove the airbox. Remove the
underside tin if you have to. Could be a head gasket. Could be a hose or
fitting. Could be one of the nuts that holds the head on. You must find the
source of the leak.
