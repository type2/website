:   [E\.....F]      Uh oh...

1983 Rabbit that needs a cylinder head job?  Pretty damn good if you ask 
me.  Those engines usually require a head job around 80-100K.
As for needing a &lt;i&gt;transaxle&lt;/i&gt;, not &quot;rear end&quot; as he stated, on a 1983 
Westfalia, hmmmmmm?  Sounds like it might have been thrashed over the 
years.  Too bad about the change to &quot;ford&quot;. You can already see what it's 
done to his general attitude and demeanor and they're NEW!  Just wait a 
couple of years. He ought to be a real jewel by then.

(My 1985 Golf has been one of my best buddies. She outlasted a wife and
two girlfriends but I've finally got to part with her, too. I can't 
afford to continue putting money into her to keep her going. It adds up 
to too much over the years but I still swear by her. Best damn car I ever 
owned!! So there!)
