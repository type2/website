&gt; On my 85 Westy, the black plastic resevoir that houses the faucet/pump
&gt; in the sink leaks.  I can't find a replacement plastic housing, called
&gt; the tank, because the part is discontinued.  I certainly don't want to
&gt; pay $200 for a new faucet/pump.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt; 
	I had the same problem in my Syncro.  There were several small cracks
in the housing and one hose barb was broken off completely.  I used a
plastic bonding agent that melts plastic then bonds with it to form a
material stronger than the actual plastic itself.  This repaired the
small cracks and I used a piece of plastic to surround the barb and
adhere it back to the faucet.  I have had no further problems with the
unit.  You can use some sort of super-glue or plastic bonding agent.  I
can't remember the name of the crap I used.
