Subject: What Service Do I Need?

I recently bought my Father-in-laws 1991 Westfalia.  It has 63,000 kms on it
(39,000 miles).  This is low kms for the age of the vehicle.  He went by the
book as far as servicing the vehicle however, he only adhered to suggested
mileage intervals between servicing, not time intervals.  This means the
vehicle was serviced about once a year including oil changes.

I am about to get the vehicle serviced for the first time.  In light of the
lack of frequent service, is there anything I should ask the mechanic to do
or check?  

Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated.
