Subject: RE: Coolant Fill Crisis Resolved, how about sagging doors?

I'm not sure I'd do it to a car as young as Donald Baxter's 85, but my drive-
way cure for sagging doors is to jack them up:  Open door about 6-8 inches,
pile up something sturdy under the door*, put a block of wood on a bottle
jack on the pile, and jack up the door a few inches.  Test fit, repeat as
needed.  Then adjust the striker plate so the trim lines on the door match
the trim lines on the car.
* pile: Workmate in good repair, sawhorses with fat board across them, tree-
stump if you can drive close enough.

Is there another solution that wouldn't make the factory cringe so badly?
B.
