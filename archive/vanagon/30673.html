Subject: I need a door panel

I am looking for a door panel to fit my sliding door on my 85 
Vanagon.  At this point, I would be happy to get one in any color as 
long as it is in good shape but I would prefer blue or grey as I have 
the Blue/Grey color combo in the interior. I can vinyl dye other 
colors if I have to. If anyone knows of a good 
source or (fingers crossed) actually has one they want to sell, 
please let me know.  Thanks for the bandwith!
