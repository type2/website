Subject: startup question

Hey Folks, 
I just got a tune-up today and am very pleased.  While there, I had them
replace the oil pressure switch with a new one.
My question is whether it is normal, after starting the engine, 
for the idle speed to increase to like 1100 rpm, and then slowly fall
to around 850 rpm within two minutes of idling.  After those two
minutes, the idle is perfect and sounds great.  Before that time, the 
idle speed will SLOWLY decrease to normal.
Before today, when I started the car, it would automatically idle
normally after the hydraulic valves were pumped up.

sound ok, or is there something wrong here?
