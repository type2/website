Subject: limericks


in the slow lane barely movin'
the VW busses go cruisin
we're not super fast
the traffic flies past
but WE understand farvergnugen!


they started out air cooled flat four
then they sold wasserboxers (by the score)  (galore?)
Eurovans, people want?
Five Cylinders? UP FRONT?
What will be next if there's more?

Martha, on the Vanagon channel
drives a van, is it a panel?
She's a sexism Cop
wants the rudeness to stop!
Always threatening us with her flannel.
