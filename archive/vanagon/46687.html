Yep, that was them.  Not only that, but later on when I'd visit for service or 
parts, I'd almost always seem Mr. Bowman there taking care of things and he 
would always recognize me and ask how the van was doing.  Apparently the 
goodness flowed from the top; when the owner of a dealership takes the time to 
remember his customers and what they bought the rest of the organization 
follows.

Lest this turn into a love fest, the I visited the Walnut Creek VW dealership 
several times and was never ever able to get a salesman to talk to me, even 
when I had an insurance company check for the totalled Jetta burning a hole in 
my pocket wanting to be spent on a new VW...eventually I stopped trying.
