Subject: Inuvik Tour 1996 Roster


Ok, folks, here's I very early list of folks you have expressed interest 
in joining the trip in August 1996 to Inuvik, NWT, Canada (that's 
practically on the Arctic Ocean, kids!) since I posted the idea to the 
list a few weeks ago.  Sorry if I've missed anybody; I haven't been that 
organized in how I handle the replies of interest, so please don't be put 
out if I've missed you on this list.  I still love you.

Tobin Copley &amp; Christa Ovenell  tobin_at_freenet.vancouver.bc_dot_ca  Definite
Martha &amp; Sarah Rubin            busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com               &quot;
Ron Lussier			coyote_at_zuni.chaco_dot_com	       Highly int.
Bob Hoover			Veedubber_at_aol_dot_com	       Interested
Paul Uusitalo (with syncro!)	puusital_at_adobe_dot_com	         &quot;
Gregor				GDURSTEW_at_oimb.uoregon_dot_edu	 &quot;
Bill Abbott			wabbott_at_megatest_dot_com		 &quot;
Michael Wagner			mwagner_at_deltanet_dot_com		 &quot;

Hey!  That's a potential 8 vehicles!  Cool!  Also cool, check out the web 
site Ron Lussier's building:

We still need representation from the splits and E-vans.  There are a few 
places in town here (Vancouver, B.C.) that rent E-van westies, so if 
anyone would like to fly out and rent one for the trip here (can you say 
&quot;road test&quot;?), drop me a line and I'll check them out.

Any ideas for a snappy acronym for the tour?
WATT: Western Arctic Transporter Tour?
