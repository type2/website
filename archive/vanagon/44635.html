I've got a couple of Bosol (Brazilian) Solex carbs on my '74. I bought 
these from Bow Wow incidentally. Because they came from Brazil, they are 
apparently jetted for methanol and run really rich on gasoline. I have been 
unable to find any replacement jets for these carbs. Bus runs like a bat 
outa hell, but only gets 14 mpg and won't even come close to passing 
emissions testing. I bought a couple of used Weber 34 ICTs that I'm going 
to try out. I've never heard of running dual Solex's on a 1600, but that 
doesn't mean it can't be done.
