Subject: Ultra Brake Pads?

Listees,

  I'm trying to find some info on these pads, They're made by a company called RT 
Industrial inc. The brand is &quot;Ultra Brake&quot;.

  I have someone who wants this Brand of pad.  I've been unable to find this Brand 
from any of my suppliers?

  Anyone out there know anything about this brand of pad?

  Thanks,

  Kyle
