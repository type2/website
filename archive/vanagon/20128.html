Subject: ANNOUNCE: Westy Tent Page -- revisions continue

[delurk]

'Lo, all.  I've been trying to improve the Westy (and other) Tent page 
and just came up with the brilliant idea of splitting it into sub-pages 
(doh!) so it doesn't take too danged long to load.  If you set your 
browser _not_ to load images when you first access the main tent page, 
you won't have to wait for my (IMHO quite excellent) large title .gif of 
two westy's on the beach to load.

Is that a run-on sentence?

Good old Michael &quot;I have tons of literature&quot; Heron's stuff on the Dove 
Mfg. Company's rooftop tent has been rescanned and (I hope) made more 
interesting in presentation.  Michael says he'll pass me some more stuff 
on tent variations, including some post '70 stuff, which is where the 
pages are weak.

I enjoy the precision inherent in the word &quot;stuff.&quot;

Also, I've been chatting with Harris Upham about a rear-mounted tent, and 
he promises to pass some scanned stuff along, too.  I'll delurk again 
when that's ready.

Finally, a reminder to John Gladu: you foolishly stated a while back that 
you'd try to send some images/info on the Karbach Kamper -- put up, dude! 
:) I'd really like to add some images to my brief mention of that option.

Thanks to all who've replied with corrections, additions, and raw 
material for the page so far!  Please let me know if you have info (even 
old rumors) of variations on camping tents for VWs.

Alas, if I get much more info on non-westy tents, I'm gonna have to come 
up with a new name for the page(s).  &quot;VW Tents&quot; just doesn't cut it.

Tentvergnugen?

Oh, yeah: http://www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/tents.html
