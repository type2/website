Subject: Gasoline Heater FS


Hello All,
	Ive got a Gasoline heater that is cluttering up someone else's
garage.  I'm not going to bother putting it into my Westfalia as I am
looking to move to Arizona.  Anyway I have no idea what type of heater it
is.  I believe that it is out of an aircooled bus or bug.  I have no
instructions, but it doesn't look too complicated to figure out.  Wiring
for fuel pump, wiring for blower fan, wiring for glow plug.  It's got some
rust on the exaust pipe.  It certainly ain't much to look at:)
	So I will give to anyone who will pay the shipping cost,(that
would be free for the other listee in Boulder, are you out there?), I
would guess shipping would be under $20.
	So if you actually think that you would use this (i.e. don't want
it just 'cuz it's free) please let me know in the next couple days as I'm
heading down to Baja as soon as I can get my act together...
