&gt; guides from getting loose with design, or rollpins or taper pins. You can
&gt; make a 21 inch gun breech gas proof in any condition whats so hard about
&gt; an 85 mm bore under much less compression? Can you clear up my
&gt; understanding of the problem?

Hello Archie.

How many miles you got on the heads? EVERY VW with 50K can use a valve job, 
with new guides.

I'm sure your VW sees a lot more use than your 21&quot; gun. If you fire your gun 
as much as your VW, how long would it last and stay tight?
