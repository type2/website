&gt;Is this the hassle factor that Sami D was eluding to earlier in his search
&gt;of the Michellin XZX 185/70 SR 14&quot;s?  Weird, huh? Sheesh, all I want is some
&gt;danged tires!!! AAARRRGGGHHHHH!!!!!

I don't understand. Tire America (York, PA) just went and ordered in a pair
of XZX's at 69.99 each (plus ~10.00 for &quot;lifetime balancing&quot;).
No hassle.
The ride is great, too.
