Subject: JCW and cruise control info plus Equss s


If you've been following the cruise updates lately, I have some more general 
information.

Today I called JCW about their cruise controls.  If you look in the catalog 
there are two models that do not have stalk mounted control pods.  The long 
rectangular pod is made by Equus and is the model I have been installing. 
 The more squarish pod is made by Audiovox (some other list members have 
installed this one and maybe they could post their review of it) and when I 
spoke with a tech svc. rep. she said that the tech. svc. manager recommended 
the Audiovox unit.  No rational mentioned.  Maybe just cause it costs a bit 
more.

On the cruise control page, there are two vacuum canisters listed.  JCW was 
not able to give me details about them (no. of ports, w/ or w/o a check 
valve, etc.)

Equus system install update:

Earlier I posted that the system was working to a degree:  it would set, 
hold speed and disengage on hitting the brakes.  But, tap up and tap down 
were not working.  I check continuity on the wire bundle I made and it was 
ok.  Today, I checked continuity on the connectors as well and one of the 
connections was not closed.  Fiddled with the pins and now tap up works: 
 tap it 10 times and the van speeds up 5 or so mph.  Not sure if tap down is 
working as well.

Stay tuned for the continuing story........
