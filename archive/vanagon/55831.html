Subject: RE:tank key

&gt;I recently bought an 83 Westie ... but the key to the water tank is
&gt;missing. I tried the paper clip trick to open it, but it didn't work.
&gt;Does anyone know if this is a &quot;generic&quot; key or are they all keyed
&gt;differently? Is there any other way to open it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

I bought an 82 Westy with a missing water tank key also, I was having a
hard time finding ignition keys at the auto parts places so I went to a
locksmith to get the ignition keys made and asked him to look at the
water tank key also. He looked at the lock and said, &quot;that is either a
XXX or YYY (some unintelligble numbers)&quot; and took off the recepticle and
I left it with him overnight.  The next day he had me two ignition keys,
two water tank keys and put the cover back on, total around $30 dollars
if memory serves.  He acted like it was no big thing.  I had thought
about drilling the lock and replacing it with one of those little screw
in things from WalMart that go on RV water intakes.  This would keep
things out, but would not give the protection of a key.  Check the
locksmiths, it can't hurt.
