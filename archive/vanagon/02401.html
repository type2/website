Subject: Re: RE: shower in a westy!

Drew - interesting idea about circulating the coolant water
thru the drinking water tank.  Makes me wonder if there would
be a way to heat this (or other) water with the propane -
sort of like one of those automatic on-demand hot water
heaters one sometimes sees in Europe, or in vacation homes,
where there's no holding tank for the hot water, it is just
heated immediately as it passes to the faucet for use...
