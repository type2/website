Subject: Re: Engine Overheating Problem


&gt;We own a '79 2.0 litre T4 panel van which runs a sweet as a nut apart from
&gt;it's overheating. It pulls well in all gears, accelerates well and doesn't
&gt;miss a beat. But whenever we pull up we have to put up with that worrying
&gt;'hot' smell we all dread!!!  

Does it run poorly at all, when you smell that hot smell?

Air cooled engines do get hot.  I remember the first time I started driving
an air cooled VW around.  It took me a while to get over the nervousness
everytime I smelled that &quot;hot smell.&quot;  It is a &quot;hot smell&quot; that is quite
differnet from the &quot;hot smell&quot; of a water boxer.  But the Bus ran well, got
good gas mileage, and never missed a beat for tens of thousands of miles
with that &quot;hot smell&quot; that eventually faded into the background of
familiarity.

When I fried the engine of my last Bug, the &quot;HOT SMELL&quot; that emanated from
that poor engine was very alarming, and very different.  I smelled like
something mechanical was going to die, and it did.  Qualitative, yes, but
true.

P.S.  Do elaborate, the hot smell you may be smelling might not be normal,
and a sign that something is wrong.  I don't mean to suggest that you
ignore it, just that it might be &quot;normal&quot; for an air-cooled engine.
