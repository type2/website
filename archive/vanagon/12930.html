Subject: Re: Why don't AT's have a drain plug?

&gt;Speaking of automatics, what's the reliability and MPG penalty? Because
&gt;of my wifes shoulder injury I'm considering the automatic. Would hate
&gt;to loose any hard to come by power though!

Have had no problems with our '85 Westy auto at all after having it two
years.  I concur with Joel about the mileage averaging 18MPG although we
have had up to 22MPG on the highway.  Around town it's great.  On the
highway I will comment on one annoyance:  if you get past 40 MPH &lt;grin&gt; and
then get slowed down forget about it downshifting to second to help you
out...it won't do it.  I sit there lumbering along with the right foot
planted and watch the speedo crawl up about a MPH per 10 seconds.  Other
than that, we both really enjoy the auto and actually wouldn't consider a
standard in the Westy again even though I grew up on them in VW buses of
all types.  Bruce
