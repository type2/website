Subject: RE: $25,000 in Syncro Camper repairs

Derek,

The same thoughts have crossed my mind (short of suicide) and I've resolved 
myself to the reality that I may not be abel to drive mine Syncro Westie on a 
daily basis much longer (considering my current state of affairs regarding the 
front CV [black&amp;]blues)....  I've considered the possibility of picking up a 
('97/'98) Concept 1 Cabrio for daily beater driving (don't tell my wife just 
yet, folks)  or possibly a '55-'59 Panel van (to be redone with the original 
H&amp;E BMW Dealership Logo) but I just haven't quite sorted it out yet.  Granted, 
I certainly don't go where you go with my Syncro, but daily driving of a Syncro 
Westie is putting a sizable hole in my income...  Any thoughts out there from 
the rest of the Syncro owners??

Some list members may be aware of my history of repair expenses for VW vans
I owned. 

My 72 camper averaged about $2,000 a year in repair expense until 1988, when
I purchased an 87 syncro camper. During the next two years, I accumulated a
pile of receipts for warranty work which, if I had had to pay for these
repairs myself, would have cost about $13,500. 

I then crashed the van into a deer, after which the insurance company
offered to pay me about $12,000 for the accident. I wrote them a letter
stating that a syncro camper was worth at least $18,000 no matter what the
blue book said and that furthermore I wanted 8.5% New York State tax added
on. They said OK and sent me a check for $19,485 minus about $3,000 salvage
value for the crashed van. I worked on this letter for, uh, two months I
have to admit.

Anyway, I got out my sawzall and cut the van up into pieces and it is now in
the attick, but that is another story. 

So flush with cash I optimistically purchased another syncro camper, brand
new, 1990, for exactly $23,000.

Would my streak of horrible luck with repair expenses end now that I was on
my third van? Would the constant repairs stop? 

Well,  I have receipts here to show that in the four years I have owned this
van I have racked up repairs that, if I had had to pay them myself, would
cost at least $11,000. 

We do not pay to garage my van here in NYC because we don't have to park it
on the street much--it is always in the dealership being fixed. 

Well, I had a lull this fall during which, incredibly, there were no
repairs. Maybe the way to avoid repairs is not to drive the van? 

Well, I had to drive it to get NY State inspection so I drove it to the VW
dealer three days ago and mentioned a few complaints I had. The dealer
called today saying that they were performing the following repairs under
warranty: 

New A/C compressor and freon
New starter switch in the steering column
New outer front outer CV joint boot

Total cost of these repairs if they had not been covered by warranty would
have been around $1,000, he said, so I am increasing my estimate of repairs
so far done under warranty on this van to $12,000, up from $11,000 just a
week ago. 

I really cannot remember what accounts for $25,000 in warranty repairs for
these two vehicles. The repairs are so numerous and constant they they all
just blurr together in my mind. Through the fogg I can remember things like
these: all brake components, coil, air box harness, brain, power windows,
every rubber boot, all the camper equipment, a new $4,000 transmission (plus
labor), about 10 CV joints, a new ball joint (I know, its a $50 part, but it
took 23 hours of labor (shop rate $63 an hour) for a dealer to diagnose and
replace....

I could go on but the pain is too much for me to continue.

&quot;Honey, what do you think is causing that?&quot; asks my wife, about the
clunking, about the stuttering, about the fact that the van just won't run,
and we have to abandon it and rent a car, in a strange town.  

But the point is that I've learned so much through all these experiences.

Wait a minute!  WHY WOULD I WANT TO LEARN THIS?!!!!  I NEVER planned to be a
motor head! What happened to me?! 

My warranty expires in 1997. When that happens, what should I do?  

I am contemplating suicide.  

Derek
