Ok. since we are on the topic of whats's got what, here is aquestion for
all you westfalia/vanagon L owners. I asked about this once before and no one
had a straight answer.On aircooled vanagon westfalias' there is a silver
plug just to the left of the dash controls and to the right of the wheel.
It has a constant 12 volt source and on the diesels its where the choke
goes; on the wasserboxers its where the rear passneger fan switch is. The
manual shows it but does not describe it. Haynes has no wiring diagram
including it... some have said its for a camper reading light.... Any
ideas? This is really bugging me, because its only on the vanagon
westfalia air cooled engines and none other (I think). Someone in Germany
ahd agreat idea that didn't take....  DC
