Subject: Clarification: OBRS

To All:

Please read 'Old Bus Recovery Squad' to mean Other-than a Newer Bus.

The idea was not meant to limit recovery to splitties but to other-than newer
buses, that is, things that run and have license plates and from which the
roadway cannot be seen when you look at the gear shift.  For example:

&quot;Excuse me, sir?  I see you have a 1990 Volkswagen van parked behind your
barn.&quot;

&quot;Eh?  You mean that old bus?&quot;
