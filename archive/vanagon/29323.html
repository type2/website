&gt;Hi all.  I'm considering buying a '79 bus.  I was looking through
&gt;Parts Place catalog last night, and noticed something peculiar.  They
&gt;sell exhaust systems for '74-'78 1/2 bus, which had no catalytic
&gt;converter.  They also sell exhaust systems for '79 1/2-'83 Vanagons,
&gt;which did have a catalytic converter.  What happened to the exhaust
&gt;for the '79 bus, which had CC?  Are these the rarest things on earth?
&gt;Anyone know whether the same exhaust w/ CC from the early Vgons can be
&gt;used?  What about '77 1/2-'79 California buses--what do they do?
&gt;
&gt;Also, I've looked at a couple '79s, and they have all had the CCs
&gt;removed.  What is the legality of this?  As long as it passes
&gt;emissions, who cares?  Or is it legally required?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any info,
&gt;Rodney
&gt;
&gt;
As far as legality goes it all depends on your state, I don't think that you can 
get away from it in Calif, but here in Pennsylvania as long as the emissions are 
low enough coming out of the tailpipe your legal.....the replacements should 
bolt right on
