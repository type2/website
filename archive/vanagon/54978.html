Subject: Re: '85 heater switch


&gt; My front fan control switch in my newly purchased 85 westy is jammed in
&gt; the third speed position and the fan does not work. If I jiggled the
&gt; switch the fan would come once in a while. The heat and defrost is fairly
&gt; ineefective without the fan  specially in this frosty part of NH.
&gt; Anyadvice would be appreciated.

I'm almost positive this is the same switch used ever since the early 
Rabbits, Sciroccos &amp; Jettas. I've replace two of them over the years 
('77 Rabbit &amp; '82 Scirocco) for less than $15 at my FLAPS. One had 
flaky connections due to corrosion, the other jammed exactly like you 
described. (Actually, it melted). You may want to check the wiring 
while you're in there, and avoid running on &quot;3&quot; with the new switch 
until the reason for meltdown is discovered.
The switch works great in my '88, but the fan is not so great... :(
