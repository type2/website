Subject: Carlisle Import, Kit, Replicar Nationals and LiMBO Rites of Spring

Is anyone showing their cars at this event?  I contacted Carlisle about
the $5 charge for the weekend and admittance and found out that it is
for showing one's car.  I was thinking about taking my Thing but, it's
in no shape to show right now and I don't have time to do it.  I might
show my Syncro but, I don't want to be the only Vanagon there.  Drop me
a line if you are going or if you know anything pertinent about the
show.
				Thanks,
					Gary
