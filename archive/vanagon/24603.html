oh, what the heck, as an oregonian now, i'l  chirp in.  i flippin'
LOVE oregon.  living in portland for the last four months i can
honestly say i have not lived in a better city, nor have i had even
one unhappy experience!  beautiful state, tons of green places to be
and run around in, beautiful rivers everywhere (avid kayaker i am, i
admit it).  the gas thing is a little strange, and took some getting
used to but whatever.  i guess there are inconsiderate 'rednecks' in
every state, but judging a population or a group based on one days
experience or after meeting/running into 0.000001 percent of the
entire group is a little shallow i'd say.  but who knows, i seem to
have an incredible amount of luck in my life and maybe i am running
into only the 0.000001 percent of the population who are nice.  maybe
after i have been here a year i will hate it, or become assimilated
into some bizarre oregon cult thing and hate all you silly
'outsiders', but i doubt either will happen.

so, as a standing offer, anyone on the list planning on driving
through portland, drop me a line and i'll meet you somewhere, take you
to silly restaurant, buy you a beer and show you a pretty view
somewhere.  i'll even tell at least one funny story.  then you can say
at least one nice person lives there. or, roll up your windows and
blow on through.  either way...

take care all,
		brandy
