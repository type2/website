&gt; Subject: Oil seals/leak areas: 1982 diesel engines

&gt; Hello vanagon members,
&gt; I though it would be about time to list some places that oil can leak
&gt; from the diesel engines in the vanagons.  I have a continual battle
&gt; with this and am giving what may be a fairly complete list of possibilities.
&gt; Feel free to add to it as you see fit.

Stuart...

  Glad to hear that your Bunker Burner is humming along again....  The
listing of your troubles helps the cetane-impaired of the list feel a
little better.  Deep down, they all want a maintenance-free, 30 MPG
bundle of diesel joy... Unfortunately, when the little diesel goes, it
dies a cruel, messy death.

  The diesel death reminds me of that virus in Zaire. Just before
the engine dies, it spews fluid from every possible place. If you
patch one place, it'll spew another. My driveway still has stains
from when NuBus had her little problem. 

  Methinks you are now *the* list diseasal expert. The &quot;Joel&quot; of the
diesel engine...

p.s. Because of *my* experience with diesel oil leaks (and the
corresponding new engine it resulted in)...I think Stuart's email
should make the FAQ file under the question:

  &quot;My Diesel leaks oil. Should I worry?&quot;

p.p.s. - btw, there are *other* uses for condoms. I guess when you have    
       a vanagon, everything looks like a tool.
