Subject: The unexpected trip part 3

Well, the day and a half that I was in Syracuse yielded many new adventures and challanges for Olga (my 71 Westy).  

I arrived at about 2PM on Friday, and after finding that no one else had checked into the hotel, I decided to explore the old stomping grounds.  

We took a drive down my old street, around the neighborhood, and went in search of a new flash for my camera.  Much to my surprise, the family that now lived in our old house was having a house sale, I was able to tour the house that we lived in, and hadn't set foot in for 26 years.  It's amazing just how much things change, but yet how much they stay the same.  Not to mention how much you DONT remember after all that time!!

Olga and I arrived back at the hotel at about 4PM to find that everyone in the family had arrived safely, except for my sister.  I thought that my parents were picking her up at the airport, and they thought that I was!!!  So, I jumped back in Olga, with expert navigational advice advice from my neice (who had never been in the area before, or in a VW Bus), and boogied to the airport.  Lucky for me I had scoped out the best route earlier.....  We arrived to find my sister and her daughter just getting their last bags from the luggage carousel (thank you slow baggage handlers).  Their trip up from Houston had been pretty uneventful except for the heavy turbulance heading into Cinncinatti, I said that I knew all about them!  From the ground level... (see the unexpected trip part 2).

We all had a great evening Friday, and Saturday it was decided that Olga would be the best source for transportation to the memorial service.  Knowing that the weight limit for a bus isn't all that much, I reluctantly agreed.  You see, my other sister from Vermont and her two daughters are rather large of stature (BTW, what is the PC term for obese?). But the six of us piled into the Westy, and made it to the church on time.

In case anyone is wondering about the seating arrangements, my sister and her daughter were on the couch, big sister (from VT) was behind me on the chair, one daughter (prone to car sickness) rode shotgun, and the other sat on the stool, facing forward (don't tell anyone we used the stool while traveling, the sticker says not to!).  Needless to say, we didn't need any heat!

After the service, I was informed that it was about 45 miles to the cemetary.  I figured, go for it!  So after a stop at McD's, where I impressed them by folding up the table so everyone would have a place to eat, we were off.

Olga was superb in the over 90 miles out and back.  She even showed her stuff when the high winds came up again on interstate 81! (take that whatever way you want, but it did get a bit hairy)  But we all made it, and the consensus was... what a great van!!!  To which I reminded all, its a not a van, its a BUS..

The trip home next.......
