It depends, if there wasn't any internal damage to the engine and as you
say the valves are improperly set because of a loose head, then there
should not be any significant long term effect. In other words Dave
Phillips did exactly the right thing, he pulled over, did not panic and
sought advice - sure beats the guy who drives 50 miles with his oil light
on and then wonders why he can't get up the hill.....DC

These engines are incredibly resilient but they can only take so much
punishment; don't know much about the water-cooled ones though....

BTW the KG C in storage, but there's still a few more miles in it before
another overhaul ;)   DC --
