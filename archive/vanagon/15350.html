Subject: Re: Repost: Microbus Tranny Questions

&gt;&gt;Mike White asked:
&gt;
Does anyone have any information on rebuilding your tranny with a &quot;Freeway
Flier gear.&quot; What is the final gear ratio of a stock, and this freeway final
ratio?
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone had experince with this?
................................................

Pre '67 Tranny in the Single cab was reconfigured with the 3.88 ring and
pinion and the 3rd and 4th gears out of a Super Beetle tranny. Works GREAT
w/ R165-15 tires. Becareful about running 205-15 or 185-15 tires with this
setup. The balance between Freeway Flying and enough RPMs to cool the engine
must be maintained. I don't even pretend to be a mechanical guru but this
works nicely. Hint: Just the 3.88 r&amp;p's tend to cost about $75-100. You can
occasionally pick up a whole Super beetle tranny core for $40-50.

I had mine built locally complete end to end (including the reduction boxes)
for $415.00.
