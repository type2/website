&gt;Hi,
&gt;I have an 87 syncro van that has a slight starting problem (this is 
&gt;different from my previous post about cold starting, although this problem 
&gt;only happens on the first start of the day)
&gt;
&gt;Some mornings I will go to start my van and almost nothing happens.....The 
&gt;dashboard idiot lights come on thru their built in test, and i hear a slight 
&gt;hum from the engine compartment, but no cranking of the starter.  I'll turn 
&gt;the key all the way off and back on and sometimes it will crank and start 
&gt;after a slight hesitation, other times nothing.  When nothing happens I just 
&gt;go back to the engine compartment and wiggle all the connectors and find 
&gt;none loose and tap all the black boxes.  Then, magically, it starts!
&gt;
&gt;WHATSUPWITDAT?
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;Fred Porter

Actually, some mornings I drive down past Beauvue and loosen a few wires
under the hood and spray a little water in the distributor cap. ;)  Just to
see if you're really reading your Bentley manual or not...

Maybe you should throw one of those V-12 engines in your Syncro...probably
won't help mileage any.
So, is sending e-mail all you do at Pax now or what???

Ok, on every VW I've had you have to turn the key all the way off every time
you try to start it otherwise the circuit is broken at the key switch.
Maybe whatever relay that completes the circuit is getting ready to die and
only makes contact intermittently.  Now that I think about it, on my Golf if
I yanked that annoying key-in-the-ignition-your-door-is-ajar relay out the
car wouldn't start.  Hmmm.  Well, you've got the manual, right?  Maybe you
can tell me why my '79 Bus runs fine until I put it into gear, then it has
NO power...

Later,
bob.
