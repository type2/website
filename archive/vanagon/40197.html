Subject: Diesel Vanagon

Two issues:

1)  After 13 years and 162K+ miles, the good wife has decided that having been
stranded 4 times (twice due to unanticipated battery failure) she wants a new
van that will be reliable, and has only 2 requirements:  power steering and
air conditioning.  Although my initial reply was to the effect that I doubt
that we will find a vehicle more reliable than the van has been.  

Any one able to provide information/suggestions  on what this vehicle might be
worth:
Located in Northern Ca. about 45 miles south of San Francisco, 
'82 Diesel Vanagon, std 7 seat cloth interior.
Interior and Exterior condition very good - could use a through vacuuming
inside and a wash, polish and wax outside.  No rust, and effectively not
dents, bashes, crunches.  (a few parking lot dings, minor) A California
vehicle all it's life (San Francisco Bay area)
50K on long block diesel,  60K on clutch --162+K overall.
New brakes all around about 6 months ago
New Battery about 3 months ago
Tires OK (Michelin lt truck tires, ext 30% tread???)
Cooling system OK - no heating problems
No obvious broken anything (that I know of)
New shocks all around about a year ago
Oil and filter changed every 3 months from day 1.
Actually seats 8 -have added 8th seat, is stock VW seat w/seat belts and
mounted to stock rails by side door.
All service records
30 mpg day in and day out
Color - Alpine White body, brown cordouroy fabric
Stereo ASM/FM tape player, graphic equalizer amp, factory front door, rear
hatch opening speakers + 2 6X9 3 ways on kickboard under third seat
Clean engine compartment- no spilled oil/grease (makes it more palatable when
I have to do maintenance)
all 4 CV joints replaced about 18 months ago
New boot on steering rack and shift linkage at tranny about 4 months ago

Any defendable price suggestions?  Guy saw the van on the road today and
followed me to the Costco parking lot and wanted to buy it!  Neither of us
knew a &quot;fair value&quot; for it .  By the way, for you other diesel Vanagon folk -
this fellow says there is a guy in Marin ( North of San Francisco) that has a
couple of diesel vans for sale, but body condition of the vehicles wasn't very
good.  What the attraction was - the guy had installed a 1.9L direct injection
motor in the van, but wanted $5700.


2)  With the sudden price rise in fuel - maybe this isn't the time to sell the
diesel!  To go from 30 mpg to 18 is a long fall.

Thanks
Harvey
