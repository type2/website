&gt;Any listmembers able to comment, before-and-after-wise, on a VW engine that
&gt;got an aftermarket counterweighted crank?

   I don't know about the before, but the off-road race engine builders
recomend 6000 rpm. I follow their advice and have had good luck, no broken
cranks or pounded out cases. Oh, I am refering to type4 engines.
