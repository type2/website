Subject: Red Rock SATURDAY dinner 

Ok, everyone, please note that we all need to eat dinner
on Saturday, too.  As I mentioned before, my suggestion is
that whatever type of food you bring to Friday nite, bring
that same TYPE (not the same thing) to Sat. as well.  So,
if you are bringing a salad on Fri, just make a different
type of salad for Sat.  From experiences at Big Sur,
it worked well to just bring lots of stuff to share
and throw on the table.  If there are any leftover prunes,
I'm sure Bardley will get them...
