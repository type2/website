Subject: Cruise control for '80-82 Vanagon

Anybody put cruise control on your bus?  My right knee has never liked
driving, but ever since the patellar cartilage was removed it
has HATED it... I measure trips in aspirin and limit them by driving
days I know the knee can survive (4, if I'm lucky).

I'm hoping that the newly rebuilt engine will have enough 
additional power so that I won't have to break out the oars on 
every hill, and cruise control will at least have a chance...
I'm not expecting it to work over Vail Pass or anything 
like that :)
