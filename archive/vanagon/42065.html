Sean tells us of his exploits chasing down a gas leak:

To which I add:
I just got done doing a similar thing w/ the Jetta; there're
various two part epoxies and such that you can buy from the
FLAPS that work pretty well to seal up holes in tanks.  I used 
the Loctite one myself, and so far it seems to have done the trick.  
A $7 + sweat investment sure beats the heck out of $300 for a 
new tank (just the tank!)  

'Wonder how dealers justify that kind of money for a piece of
plastic?
