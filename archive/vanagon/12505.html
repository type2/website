I'm driving my Microbus
At which I must sometimes cuss.
The reduction gearing
Has de-stroyed my hearing,
While driving my Microbus.

I'm driving my Bread Loaf bus,
Which handles without much fuss.
But the wind blows me sideways,
Out on the big highways,
While driving my Bread Loaf bus.

I'm driving my Vanagon,
Of which I am very fond.
It's neat and extensive,
But repair's expensive
While driving my Vanagon.

I'm driving my Eurovan,
As fast as I really can.
It's faster than turtles ...
I can jump over hurdles,
While driving my Eurovan.

I'm Otto, the bus-driving fool,
I think buses are really cool.
I love to go swimming
With bow-legged women,
I'm Otto, the bus-driving fool.
