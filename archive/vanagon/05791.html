Subject: Re: cheap Metalic Brake Pads =&gt; Squeek!


	Well, your milage may vary and all that, but the Repco Metal Master
pads in my brother's GTI don't squeek and I plan to put same in the Corrado
when the time comes. He plans to put Metal Masters on his Vanagon when new
ones are needed and I'll be able to report actual Vanagon experience at that
point.
	I can report that I once put a pair of cheap 'metalic' pads on my
late wife's Golf and they wouldn't stop squeeking. So I replaced them with
regular VW pads and they did not squeek. I'm inclinded to blame the
pad when I hear squeeking, and that experience led me to believe that, 
since you get what you pay for, cheap brake pads are a false economy.

	Bill
