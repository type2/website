Subject: Rear lid struts

My rear lid on my '84 Westy had the habit of slowly falling after I 
opened it.  The old struts are mismatched and making squishy noises.  
So... I bought a new pair.  The problem is the old ones have the fat end 
connected to the door, but the Bently book seems to indicate that the fat 
end goes on the top.  Help.... which way is the correct way to install the 
new ones?  

Also the fittings on the top and bottom of the new struts are 
twisted in relation to one another.  How do i get the two fittings to 
line up?  I tried twisting them by hand and they don't budge.  I'm afraid 
that if I use something like a crescent wrench that I will bend the 
fittings.
