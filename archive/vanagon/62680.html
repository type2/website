Howdy listeeeess,

Do I hear a great big Howdy back?

You must not all live in Calgary where I am then!

Stampede's a goin and the party's never stop.

Heard a joke, thought I'd share it with you, cause you're so special.

A Panda bear (black, white, furry)walks into a bar, asks the bartender for
some bamboo, Bartender looks at the Panda really funny and says, we don't
serve bamboo here. Panda slams his paw down on the counter and demands some
bamboo!

Bartender steps back amazed at how mad the Panda is and says he'll go to
the back and try and get some made right up. Bartender is gone for a while,
when he returns he has a smile on his face and a plate of bamboo for the
Panda. Panda chews the food down, pulls out a gun from his back pack and
starts shooting the place up puts the gun away  and goes to walk out.

Bartender has had enough and says &quot;You can't just come in her and do that&quot;,
Panda says &quot;yes I can, says so in the dictionary&quot;, bartender looks at the
panda like are you for real?, Panda pulls out websters from the back pack
flips to Panda, Bartender reads the definition...

&quot;eats Bamboo, Shoots, Leaves&quot;
