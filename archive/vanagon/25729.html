&gt;I am pretty sure I had 22 tickets by the time I was 22.  I got four of
&gt;them on the Autobahn in Germany.  The funny thing is, I drive the same
&gt;now but I haven't gotten a ticket in over 3 years.


Ditto, David. 4 tickets in two years in Colorado, but clean record for
the four years I've been here. (Well, traffic school helped a little).

But here, everyone drives like me! I blend into the crowd so easily...
even in my Mustang.
