&gt; Kirk,
&gt; 
&gt; The book says that this system must be power bled.  However, I rplaced the clutch slave and managed to manually bleed it the way you seem to be trying to.  
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Be sure the resevoir is kept full during the process.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Be persistent.  I only got a tiny bit of air the first 25 
&gt;    clutch strokes.  It probably took 50 strokes to do the whole 
&gt;    job!
&gt; 
I have had good luck bleeding VW hydraulic clutches using a
MITIVAC vacuum assisted bleeder, bled our '86 Vanagon, and my
'86 Quantum.  Still I always figured they could be bled using
standard techniques.  With the vacuum pump, simply attach pump
up the vacuum, open the vavlve and depress the pedal slightly,
results are excellent.\
