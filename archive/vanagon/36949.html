Subject: Re: CV Boots


&gt;Do you mean that there is a cv kit from sears hat you can install without
&gt;removing the shaft. I bought a boot seal and have been procrasyinating
&gt;because of the effort of removing all those clogged up allen headed screws.
&gt;if do please say where to get those kits

Nope, sorry. The tool from Sears is an Allen wrench (in my case) with a
3/8&quot; drive. The boot kit comes from VW or VW-oriented FLAPS. The bolts just
aren't that bad. Run a little tiny knife around in there, then gently tap
the tool in with a hammer, then untorque. Mine came out alright and they're
a lot older than yours.

The hardest part is getting the circlip off the axle, you'll need two
people if you don't have the strange pliers they use to put the spacers on
the crankshaft. Two people can do it with screwdrivers.
