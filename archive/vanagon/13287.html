Subject: Re: Syncro Westie With the Front CV (Black and) Blues

Derek,

We ordered the Syncro in March, '91, picked it up on Euro Delivery in June '91, 
and the sticker indicates a production date of September, '90.  Under the 
original sales agreement in effect in March, '91, it was my understanding that 
we had a 24,000 mile/24 month warranty on the whole vehicle.  Unless there is 
something from VWUS or VWAG that is contrary to this &quot;Factory Warranty&quot;, I have 
exceeded the manufacturer's warranty.  Is there something that VWUS is not 
telling us????  
As a sidebar to this, I had a starter go out on me a year ago at 40,000 miles 
and had to literally &quot;go to war&quot; with VWUS to get them to adjust the bill for 
premature failure of this OEM part.  How I did this was I called the local 
Bosch distributor and found out that Bosch had had a lot of warranty problems 
with both new and rebuilt starters in the '89-'91 timeframe, so I pressured 
VWUS into admitting that it could have been an OEM problem.  What happened was 
that they split the bill with me 50/50, which seemed equitable at the time, 
seeing as how I'd had 40K miles on the starter.  If, in fact, there was an 
extended warranty in effect at that time, I fully intend to formally request a 
full refund from VWUS on the portion that I paid!

Please let me know where to find this information so that I can get some relief 
here...  

       Jon



What are you guys talking about? Unless Jon bought the van during the first
two months of 1990 these joints should still be covered under factory
warranty provided the boot is still good.
