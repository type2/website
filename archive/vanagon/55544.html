Well, it's bout time I let on with my experimental testing results.

I, too had squeaky bushings, tried silicone spray, lasted a little 
while.  Then I tried a teflon based lubricant.  Quiet now for several 
months.

It came in a small tube with a clip for hangin on yur pocket.  Hard to 
get into the joint, but it seems to work.  Not a spray, found it in a 
hardware type store.
