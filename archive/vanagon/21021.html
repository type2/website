I would like to submit my comments to the note from James Brill regarding
tranny supports for his bus.  I had a '69 bus for several years and had to
pull the engine on many occasions. I was not aware of a tranny strap but I
would have used one if it had been available. I made my own with a 2x4 and
chains...not fun but workable. A floor-jack on wheels was very helpful to
ease the engine off the transmission spline and out of the engine compartment.
Tying the tranny up made the process of getting the engine out (and in again)
easier using the floor jack. Unless you have a sunken garage floor, the tranny
dips pretty low without the support and when you go to put the engine back
in again the angle is wrong. You have to jack the tranny up anyway to align
the spline and clutch, so why not support it in the first place? The comment
about the tension on the CV joints was good, don't think I would let the
tranny sit unsupported for a long time.   Tim Schlaile
