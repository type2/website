&gt; That's already been addressed.  The problem with gasoline burning 
&gt; vehicles is that there are a lot of them in urban areas.  ...

The problem with cars is that there are a lot of cars.  Gas, diesel, 
propane, electric, nuclear, whatever... they're still bloody cars and it 
seems to me, looking out my window, that about 8 or 9 out of every 10 has 
one person in it.  Now, the car is a great &quot;personal teleportation 
device&quot; as an old professor I once studied under characterized it, but 
wow, the near total reliance by past and current governments on this form 
of individualized transport--to the exclusion of all other transportation 
alternatives--is making our cities unliveable, and has allowed the 
creation of suburbs designed around the car.  Imagine trying to live life 
in the 'burbs without a car!  

Automobile-based &quot;planning&quot; has created cities where it is considered 
acceptble to spend a couple of hours in the morning, and a couple of 
hours in the evening, crawling along a clogged highway with a few other 
hundred thousand similarly herded unfortunates.  Maybe the situation is 
worse in the vancouver area than elsewhere, but rush-hour travel time by 
car from, say , downtown to a major suburb like Surrey or Twawwassen is 
at least 1 1/2 hours and usually more since some bozo typically runs out 
of gas in the middle of a critical bridge along the way.  Three hours or 
more every day driving in rush hour traffic jams?  Multiply that out over 
a working life, and that's more of my life than I'm willing to give up.

All those cars sure put a lot of crap in the air, but perhaps more 
importantly, they also use up a lot of land (like 20 - 25% of the land 
area in a typical central city is used for roadways), do not create 
people-friendly environments, make a helluva racket, steal people's lives 
commuting in traffic jams, and force people to spend a lot of money 
supporting them--money they wouldn't have to shell out if there was a 
public transportation system (or car/van pooling program, or 
bicycle-friendly streets, or...) that actually worked.  Many North American  
cities had great transportation systems, but as Bob Hoover pointed out, 
we have GM, Firestone, and Standard Oil to thank for systematically 
destoying them so that everybody would have to buy cars, tires, and 
gas.  Don't believe me?  Look it up.

Now we're faced with a Tragedy of the Commons, because everyone has so 
much &quot;invested&quot; in car-oriented development that they'd hate to be so 
inconvenienced as to have to give up their cars and invest big 
bucks in, then actually RIDE a BUS (the public kind, God forbid!).  No, 
that'd be political suicide to pull something like that, folks would jump 
up and down screaming about the imfringement of their God-given Right to 
drive their own car, by themselves, anywhere they God damn want.  And 
they have a right to do it cheaply, too.  People don't want 
sustainability: they want convenience.  And their grandchildren will 
surely be clever enough to deal with the mess created.    
 
Yeah, I'd like to live somewhere where I could own a little house with a 
big garage :-), but the commuting time and total dependence on a car to 
get anything done would kill me.  So I choose to live right smack 
downtown.  I'm really lucky that vancouver has a really nice 
neighbourhood right in the downtown core, so I'm pretty content.  I walk 
to get to the places I need to get to, and have my happy westy to go 
camping way the hell up in the mountains.     

What's really sad is that if it came down to putting food on my family's 
table or letting them starve, I'd be right there sitting in a traffic jam 
on Highway 99 with a few hundred thousand other folks.  And maybe, just 
maybe, after a few years of 3 or 4 hour daily commutes, I'd tell people, 
&quot;It's not so bad, I've got a nice stereo, and it gives me time to myself...&quot;

Shaking in my boots,
Tobin
