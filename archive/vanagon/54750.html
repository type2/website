Subject: Fuel Gauge Question

As the Bently book tells you to use a factory tester to test fuel gauge
and sender (no help), I am wondering if anyone has experience with a
known good sender and knows the resistance at empty, half-full, and
full. This is how they are tested and VW's black box tester procedure is
just an attempt to keep us from diagnosing problems ourselves. At $60
per hour, I can more cheaply buy a new sender than pay them, but I'd
rather test it correctly so I replace the proper part, the gauge or the
sender.

Anyone out there ever tested a known good one and know the proper
readings?
