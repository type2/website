Subject: electronic ignition in '71/1600?

Anyone have opinions (naah, not here) on electronic ignition conversion
kits? I have a 71 with a stock 1600 engine.

Specifically, a fellow 71-er recommended the Bug-Pak from Jacobs
Electronics. Says it did wonders for his power and mileage. Supposed to be
smog-legal in California (where I am).

Upsides? Downsides? Warnings? On this brand or on electronic ignition in
general.

Thanks!
