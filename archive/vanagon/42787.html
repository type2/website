Subject: RE: engine seal/tin holes


&gt;How goodly does the air seal(y'know...those airborne mammalian blobs)
&gt;need to seal?  Mine is good in some areas, yet is bent weirdly or has
&gt;gaps in some areas...I know it is for to keep the nasty hot air from
&gt;the exhaust, etc. from coming up and getting blown back through the
&gt;*cooling* system, but how much is good enuff?  Also, I have noticed
&gt;holes (up to 1/4 in. diameter) in a few places on the tin...should I
&gt;find something to cover or plug them with?

Well, I'm not sure how good is good enough, but I know how much isn't.
Had a '71 bus with upright engine (not T4 like yours), which had a good
seal all around with no gaps. Being in CA where 65F is regarded as &quot;cold&quot;,
I removed the heater hoses on either side and capped the outlets in the
fan shroud. Also removed the accordians underneath to keep from getting
exhaust into the interior.

Then, in my wisdom, I left the holes in the sheet metal next to the seal,
wide open, including the one for the warm air feed to the carb.

Boys and girls, don't try this at home. After one long freeway run at
65 mph, the engine hatch *cover* was so hot I could barely get it open.
A knowledgeable list member who looked at it later, contained himself
admirably, and simply mentioned that this usually led to overheating,
and did I notice any recently?

So, I'd say that if your seal gaps add up to the area of a couple of
2&quot; heater hoses, THAT'S TOO MUCH.


&gt;On that note (C#) I would also like to further my edyookashun by asking:
&gt;&quot;Does and &quot;81 2000cc FI Vanagon engine have an idiot light for
&gt;overheating?&quot;

Yup. It's in the rear-view mirror. When you notice a bright glow in
your mirror, sometimes accompanied by your headliner curling into
strange shapes, it's time to slow down.   :^)

Seriously, they don't have overheating lights. Some people put aftermarket
cylinder-head temperature gauges in their cars, or oil-temp gauges.
JC Whitney used to market these (do they still?). Also, some aftermarket
VW specialty shops can get them.
