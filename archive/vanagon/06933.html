Subject: The Oldest Profession

A physician, a civil engineer and a lawyer were arguing about what was the 
oldest profession in the world.

The physician remarked, &quot;Well in the Bible, it says GOD created Eve from a 
rib taken from out of Adam. That clearly required surgery, so I can rightly 
claim that mine is the oldest profession in the world.&quot;

The civil engineer interrupted, and said, &quot;But even earlier in the book of 
Genesis, it states that GOD created the order of the heavens and the earth 
from out of the chaos. This was the first and certainly the most 
spectacular application of civil engineering. Therefore, fair doctor, you 
are wrong: mine is the oldest profession in the world.&quot;

The lawyer leaned back, smiled and then said confidently, &quot;But who do you 
think created the chaos?&quot;
