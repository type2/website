&lt;&lt; Just a quick few questions here, firstly is it possible to have cylinders
 reconditioned or is it simply better and more worthwhile to buy a new set?&gt;&gt;

In the case of engines having horizontally opposed cylinders the quick answer
is replace rather than recondition.  The reason is that cylinders operated
horizontally produce more wear on the down-hill side resulting in an oval or
elongated bore in the end of the cylinder nearest the crankshaft where the
piston's motion is reversed.  This pattern of wear, which is also seen in
aircraft engines, is described as 'belly' or 'sag'.   Since the typical
cylinder hone guides on the bore, reconditioning the cylinders does nothing
to restore the concentricity of the cylinder bore to the axis of the
cylinder.  

&gt;&gt; Secondly when I removed my heads from my 74 1800, there were what looked
to
 be circular metal shims between the heads and the cylinders.  Are these
 standard engine seals or gaskets and do they need to be replaced when
 putting everything back together.&lt;&lt;

The 'shims'' are cylinder seals.  They are standard items on the Type IV
engine.  They are made of steel coated with soft aluminim.  Since their
purpose is to insure a proper seal between the cylinder and the head, and
since the soft aluminum hardens as a result of age and use, they should be
replaced whenever the heads are removed.

 &gt;&gt; Thirdly I've poured solvent into the
 intake and exhaust manifolds for both of my heads and there seem to be no
 leaks; does that mean that I can simply bolt my heads back on or should I
 get a valve and head job anyways.
  &gt;&gt;

The solvent test is meant to detect leaks in freshly lapped valves.  There
may be deposits of combustion products on the valve or valve seat which could
allow a head to pass this test when cold but provide poor sealing at
operating temps.  As a general rule, it is wise to dismantle the valves,
check for valve stem wear, re-lap the valves and replace the valve stem seals
whenever the head has been removed for any reason.
