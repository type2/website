Thank you, Drew! Hopefully I'll have more luck than I need.


&gt;Do you plan to keep the list informed as to your progress? I'm
&gt;sure most list members will be interested in following you as you
&gt;travel Route 66.

Well, not &quot;live&quot;, as Hoover did, I'm afraid. I don't have a portable PC,
and my only Internet access is here where I work. Besides, most of the
&quot;adventure&quot; will take place late Friday, and Saturday and Sunday, when
people who steal\\\\\use Internet service from work like I do, mostly
won't be in to get the running reports anyway. But I will keep some
notes, and do a Panamint-Springs style writeup, hopefully on Monday.
If things go as planned, the trip will be over almost as soon as it
begins.

And, if it starts dragging out into a Grendel-sized road-repair project,
the report might wind up in the form of a &quot;FOR SALE: AS IS, WHERE IS&quot;
post.

Now DON'T you guys start wishing for that outcome!!! I need POSITIVE
thoughts coming my way, not negative! We all know that VWs are somewhat
psychic, able to know what we want, and whimsical in deciding whether
to cooperate. Beam me home, vanagon_at_lenti!   :^)
