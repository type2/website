&gt; Ahhh, the high flow oil pump (incredulous voice per Click n Clack 
&gt; Bros.).  Now there's a thought.  Extra tall gears cutting into the 
&gt; housing/cover.  Al bits to be sure.  Seems like that would be more of 
&gt; a even, continual scraping noise tho.

...and once it wore in, the noise would go away and all would be well.
I have a high volume pump too and had no trouble like that.  But, if you
want to check you can pull the pump out before you tear down the engine.
I agree with Dan about the bearings.  The bearing material is not magnetic,
and looks similar to aluminum except duller.  Would be hard to tell the
difference when looking at fine particles, I think.  I would pull the
engine immediately and tear it down as there is obviously a serious 
internal problem.
