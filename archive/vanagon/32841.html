Subject: RE: Engine explosions


&gt;A neighbor ('90 Westy) reports re-occurring engine explosions that have
&gt;started recently and doesn't know what is happening.  Any guesses?

Uh... Bradley, /martha, et. al., have somehow gotten access to his
engine compartment, in close vicinity to a campground?
