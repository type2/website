Subject: How do I use VW color code?('81)

Hello All,

	I would like to buy some touch up paint for my '81 Westy.  I could
not find a color code tag under the dash on the left, is it some where
else on a Westy?  My van is that eggnog color, &quot;Ivory&quot; I believe is the
official VW color name.  Is &quot;Ivory&quot; the same from brand to brand? I got
the VW color code from the archive, the code is L567 or L62.  How do I use
this information to buy paint?  When I look at the books from touch up
paint makers at a FLAPS I don't see anything like this, no &quot;Ivory,&quot; no VW
codes and no '81 models.  Is this a dealer only item or do I need to find
a real paint supplier?  Any recomendation and advice will be welcomed.

	Thank You.
