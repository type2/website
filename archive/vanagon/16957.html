Subject: Re: First year of Disk Brakes?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If anyone can tell me the first year for disks on the bus, please let me know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think it is 1970 but can anyone tell me conclusively?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;..Markus
&gt; I'm pretty sure that it is 1971.  Hence the unusal number of them in the 
&gt; weakly stats.  In 73' the brakes calipers were enlarged.  Most of you got 
&gt; the T4 engine with it though.

What do you mean &quot;hence the number in the stats&quot; Are you saying that the 
first issue of disk brakes had problems??
