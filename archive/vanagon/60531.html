Hi All,

I had sold my 84 GL Brownie Bus a week ago Saturday and yesterday I ended
up buying an 82 Diesel passenger Van in Oklahoma which also happens to be
brown.  This one is in decent shape, but the tires have been slashed, the
vacuum pump is not functioning and the slave cylinder for the clutch is
acting up.  I may do a gas conversion on this one, or keep the diesel.  I
haven't decided yet.  I do have a 1.8 upright from an 89 Fox as a donor.

Soo...  overall here's my vehicle status:

89 Fox donor car (parts available)
86 Syncro GL daily driver
84 Vanagon automatic (for sale)
82 Diesel Passenger Vanagon
70 Bus platform (donor)
66 Dlx Microbus (saved for Chip Shaner)
66 Camper from old Mexico
64 Single Cab (soon to be on the road)
63 Westy (longterm storage)
63 Sunroof Bug (donor)
63 Bug (longterm storage)
61 Bug (project)
61 Dbl Cab (hybred project)
60 Dbl Cab (for sale)
58 Panel (sold, awaiting pick-up)
