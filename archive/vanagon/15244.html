&gt;Does someone care to make an ascii?

I hope this helps.  I saw several of these suckers at the show (first time
I've ever seen one, and I finally walked over to find out what they were.)
They're quite silly looking.


Front view:
                          __  
                      ....::   &lt;-- Water goes in here
     Warm           ,' ... ',
     air enters -&gt;  : :###: :
     central hole   '  '''  ''''
     (###)           '..........  &lt;-- Cool air comes out here (through
                                      the top of the passenger window)

Top view:

          There is a screen here covering the hole
