Kind of depends upon what you call proper power.  I thought the type 4 
engine in our old '72 bus was kind of nifty.  I think the 5 in the '93 EV 
MV is actually plenty.  Never not had enough power except to outrun 
sports cars.  Of course I have no need to drag race in my van.  If you;r 
more comfortable with more power well thats fine too.

As for why VW's have smaller engines, its to do with taxation and 
requirements outside of the US.  We get more big engines than they do in 
the VWs as I understand it while they have a wider range of smaller
engines.  Don't Caravelles in Europe still have at leastthe option of a
1.6 liter?
