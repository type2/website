&gt; 7.) Has anyone ever mounted a Type-4 engine (1800cc or bigger) in a 68-71

&gt; the oil pump, for type-1 style (upright fan) engines. Any suggestions or
&gt; tales of experience, either good or bad?

   I put a 2 litre in my 70. It did require changing the engine mounts,
   making up aload of tinware, some extra wiring (to cope with having
   an alternator instead of a dynamo) and careful choice of flywheel/clutch
   parts to make sure it all went together properly. It is probably more
   hassle than going the big bore route, but IMHO the performance increase 
   over the standard type 2 1600 made it all worthwhile. 

   Result? Same MPG, higher top speed, and it screams up hills 
   (well compared to before anyway) and actually accelerates instead of 
   just gathering momentum. 

   The other reason for me going this route was in the UK, insurance
   companies count any non-standard engine (ie a big bore) as a 
   modification to the vehicle, and therefore charge you huge premiums.
   The 2 litre on the other hand was an original vw made product as 
   fitted to the some busses, and so my insurance premium is about the same
   as for the 1600. Suits me.
