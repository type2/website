&gt;(Vancover Island).  I think there is a ferry from Victoria to Vancover,
&gt;B.C. as well.  

THINK!  B.C. runs the largest ferry fleet in the world.  Ferries from
Vancouver to Victoria carry over 650 cars and 2000 passengers per load.
During the summer there are hourly sailings from 5am to 10pm from both B.C.
ports.  There are five mainland departures [3 in Washington (Anacortes,
Seattle, Port Angeles); relatively small ferries (~100 cars or so)], and
four arrival sites on the island.  Cost isn't cheap, though.  The cheapest
one way fare is getting close to $30Can (all the runs from Washington are
&gt;$50Can), and you have to take a ferry to get here.
