&gt;
&gt;I wanted to thank everyone for your help on my leaking heads 
problem.
&gt;
&gt;One of you guys made me think about the future of my relationship 
with my 
&gt;Vanagon.  It has 140K mi and the heads are beginning to leak.  The 
VW deale
&gt;r 
&gt;is telling me $850 to replace both of the heads but I'm wondering 
if 
&gt;getting a rebuilt engine is a better way to go.  Also, two other 
things:
&gt;1-How much will I be looking at for a rebuilt wasserboxer?
&gt;2-Any reputable VW mechanics in the Capital District area 
(Albany,NY)?
&gt;
&gt;Thanx again,
&gt;Nate El Great

Unfortunately, I've been down that road, too, recently. My '87 had 
100k when one of the head gaskets started leaking. I love the van, 
and its in beautiful shape, so rather than trickle money into it, I 
decided to go with a rebuilt.  The garage (Bob's Auto Parts, 
Springfield, MA) said he could rebuild it, or, he recommended a GEX 
rebuilt because of their nationwide guarantee. I went with the GEX, 
and when all was said and done the job ran about four grand.This 
included a new exhaust system and new clutch (both were original).
The rebuilt from GEX was, I believe, $2300. Not cheap.

After having it for a couple months we took a trip down to Florida 
and while refueling in GA I smelled antifreeze!! I took it to 
Autowerks on Hilton Head Island and was informed one of the heads 
was cracked! GEX promised to overnight a new head to Autowerks, 
when in actuality it took them about two weeks. Otis, the GEX 
customer service manager had no shortage of excuses why it took so 
long, either.  Autowerks charged about $350 to install the new head 
(including a few small odds and ends) and GEX reimbursed me $300 
without much delay. Jack from Autowerks commented about what a nice 
job Bob's Auto Parts did installing the new engine.

That was 10K ago, and all is well. The van runs &quot;like new money&quot;, 
and I'm over the anxiety caused by GEX's sloppy handling of getting 
me the new head.

A friend of mine has an '86 with 185k and his head gasket just 
went.  He was just going to get that fixed, but when they took the 
heads off they were cracked and had to be rebuilt.  After throwing 
in a new waterpump, and new exhaust (which I think you'll have to 
unless yours is in great shape) he ended up spending $2500.  He 
just had this done, so I can't compare long term results.

I know its a lot of $$, but if you're happy with your van, what 
else can you get that you'll be happy with for $4,000? For me, I 
feel I made the right call. Your results may vary.

Mike
