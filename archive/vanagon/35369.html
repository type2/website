Subject: Where'd I see that gizmo

My camper's PO installed some in door speakers.  This required he
remove the door opening limiter/holder in the door.  Somewhere in the
past month or so, I know I saw an advertisement or listing for a
replacement gizmo that was needed, I think, for installing when you
replaced front glass with full frame(get rid of vent window).  Now I
can't find it.  I have already put one crease in the door due to high
wind blowing it out of my hand.  Anybody know where I saw that, and
will you please e-mail me the name of the place or a solution to this.
 Thanks to all.
Richard
