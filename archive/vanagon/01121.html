 &gt; The Bentley manuals ARE the official VW manuals.  Bentley is just the

 &gt; whether they are the Bentley manuals.  This is not to judge them -- as a
 &gt; matter of fact, since you have one, Caroline (or George?), could you say
 &gt; whether it's better or worse than the Bentley manuals? (or haven't you
 &gt; seen Bentley's?) You can't really have too many, I don't think. Sort of
 &gt; like Money and RAM. :-)

 All kinds of manuals are available through the Whitney catalogue and I have
two of them.  The most expensive one (and the most helpful) is, in fact, the
Bentley Official Factory Repair Manual.  The other is a Haynes manual which
is okay, but tends to be vague when the subject matter gets most critical.
Also the photographs occasionally look like some sort of perverse torture
rituals.
