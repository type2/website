&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There's only one reason they replaced the air-cooled engines.  The stricter
&gt; &gt; emission requirements forced them to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; If this were true then how is it possible for these engines to pass 
&gt; today's CA smog tests? Also, Europe (the bulk of the market)  never had 
&gt; any of these tough emission requirements until the late 80's? 
&gt; 

They don't PASS CA smog test for TODAY'S vehicles. They are tested for 
emissions at levels set for the MODEL YEAR.._dot_usually (an exception is the 
1991 model year Vanagons sold in California as 1990 models to pass the 
looser emission levels...I have a VanagonCarat manufactured 2/91 which is 
a 1990 MODEL for California registration purposes!)

 &gt; -- &gt;Isn't it more of a case that VW had tried to get away with putting 
&gt; an old engine (carry over from bus) in a new much heavier body and found 
&gt; that the hp was simply not up to snuff? -DC

NO...
