Well, let me jump in with my two cents' worth, since you mentioned
Dodge.  Back in the grand old days of badge engineering, several times
CR had completely opposite reviews of virtually identical Chrysler
cars, save for the badges.  Same with GM cars.  Other times, they
complimented items/components (not talking about options here) that
simply did not exist on that particular car.  That did it for me.

&quot;Why should you believe us?  Because we don't take advertising...&quot;
- No, I don't believe you because the reviews are crap.
