Subject: Syncro 4WD Stickers

Tech-ni-fade (I am sure this isn't the right name exactly) makes a beautiful
sticker that goes the length of the vehicle along the entire side bottom from
the metal indent down. 

My 87 came with one of these but it is not factory.

I bought another one and plan to put it on the 90. It too is silverish.

The advantage is that it keeps brush from scraping paint off when you are
driving through trees and brush and fields and things.
