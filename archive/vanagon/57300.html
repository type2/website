Subject: Rear Heater Valve
Date: Mon, 17 Mar 1997 18:36:50 -0600

Vanagoners:

	Van's all back together with new, non-leaking valve installed. Mine's a
&quot;weekender&quot; (rear seat folds down to make bed with rear mattress); a fair
amount of dissection required to access rear heater core.
	Anyway, the valve, when working properly, completely occludes the coolant
flow when turned &quot;off.&quot; So my old (original) valve DID need to be
replaced. The immediate cause of the slow leak was a gasket that was
defective. Could have gotten by with just replacing it, but for 36 bucks,
doing it all made sense. Getting the assembly apart and back together is a
&quot;challenge.&quot;
	If anybody plans to do same, I'll be happy to kibitz.
