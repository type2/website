Subject:      montgomery, AL: 93 EV GL - $8950?

well, the ad in Bulletin Board, April 10-16, 1997, says:

&quot;73 Volkswagen Eurovan GL, family van, imaaculate condition, loaded with
power windows, door locks, seats seven people, has front and rear air
condition, automatic transmission, premium sound system, have all books
and records available since it was new, has average miles on it. I will
sell it below bank load for $8950 or trade for a late model pickup.
(334) 288-0970 or (334) 317-3819 beeper&quot;

... now we KNOW that no 73 bus has power windows or door locks. ;) so it's
most likely a 1993 EV.

i'd volunteer to go look at it, but it's two hours away. :( the little
magazine is from the Montgomery, Alabama area and the 288-prefix is from
that same area.
