&gt;My understanding is the Weekender is a GL with a fold down back seat
&gt;that makes a queen size bed.  It's not a Westy.

Yes, you're correct, a GL non -  Westy Vanagon 7 passenger like yours that has a
sofabed in rear, and fold down middle seat is a Weekender, But I think Vince was
referring to the '85-'86 Wolfsburg non-GL base Westy with poptop. As I said it
is often referred to as a &quot;WolfsburgWeekender Westy&quot; because it's not a full
camper.
