&gt;there was a late splittie sunroof (green and white) sitting in a
convenience store next to a red VW Fox (sporting Alaska plates) BOTH
had V_at_L stickers on them....who owned those two???

That would be me and my alaskan buddy tim (a vanagon has been, now 
vanagon wanna bee).  

Well, I feel gipped.  No transportor ale.  (I had some of Tim's Stout 
to trade.....)
