Boy, it's hard to decide which place to go to; they all sound great! But I
think a decision must be made now before you guys leave work and easy
access to the internet. No one seemed to mind going to Stuft Pizza, so
shall we say Stuft it is?

The address is 191 Castro in Mountain View. Patrick, would be so kind
and give us all some direction from the closest HiWay off-ramp?

If I hear no protests by, say, 5pm, I'll make reservations for tomorrow,
7pm. My present estimate is 10-15 people.
