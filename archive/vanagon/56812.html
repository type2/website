Subject: Starting problems - 86 GL

My 86 Syncro is having starting problems, this is a recent problem and some
days it starts just fine but other times it just won't go.

When the problem occurs the van either cranks and cranks with no sputter or
sign of starting or it cranks and sounds as though it is about to fire but
never does.  Inevitablly, it smells of gas so I push the accelator pedal to
the floor before trying again, but that doesn't seem to help.

Also, if it does start and for some reason stalls then it needs to sit for
at least ten minutes before it starts again, it has been t his way since I
bought the van and thought originally that the two problems were
independant but now I wonder if this problem has grown into something the
problem above.

Any ideas??????
