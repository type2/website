&gt; &gt; A properly tuned TDI motor should not smoke and is very clean, emissions-

&gt; &gt; or whatever it is).

&gt; My next door neighbor has always bought the latest VW, and now she has
&gt; a new Passat TDI. The car puts out a LOT of smoke. It is not a heavy black
&gt; smoke, but more greyish; it still stinks pretty badly however. She
&gt; says she gets nasty looks all the time. She also has had a few people
&gt; honk the horn and hold their nose when they pass her car. The car is
&gt; very well maintained by the excellent local VW dealer, and runs perfectly.
&gt; 
&gt; The most smoke is on acceleration from a stop. Out on the highway, smoke
&gt; is less noticable, but still smells badly. But, then, so do M-B's.

Besides our 93 EV we have a 97 TDI Passat sedan.  So far it's a greta
car, no problems, no bugs, no loose stuff and very little smoke.  I have
driven behind the car in city traffic and have noticed little to no
smoke, and the diesel exhaust smell is not nearly as noticeable as most
other diesels on the road.  Most people that have driven in it don't
realize that it is a diesel, much less people on the road giving me
nasty looks. Considering the published emissions tests the the TDI has
produced, maybe people should be applauding her instead of giving her
nasty looks!
