&gt;How are all you guys with the broken screw bosses holding

I'd suggest using some epoxy compound and then re-drilling and tapping to
re-create the boss.  A liquid epoxy should work well for a boss that is
cracked or split, while a putty compound would work better if the boss is 1/2
gone or completely broken off.

Good luck,
