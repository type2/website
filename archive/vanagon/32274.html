Lightning Emergncy Power (EPU) Takes Quantum Leap in Portable Energy Technology
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alamorgordo, NM - ATI Power Products announces a new addition to its line
of mini-generators.  last year, the company introduced the Lightning
Charger, the first of a new series of lighweight portable generators.  The
Lightening Charger is capable of jump-starting heavy earth-moving equipment,
yet can be carried easily on a shoulder carrying strap.  The all new Lightening 
EPU provides truly portable electricity for running power tools miles from
civilization, providing emergency lighting or power in disaster situations.
It also possesses the same battery boosting characteristics as the Lightening
Charger.  The unique combination of AC and DC outputs make the Lightening EPU
one of the most versatile emergency generators of its kind.

The Lightening EPU weighs only 16 pounds and is smaller than one cubic foot,
yet it provides up to 800 watts of 115 volts AC power through twin outlet
receptacles.  It also provides 55 amps of charging power and 80 amps of boosting
through detachable jumper cables.  The engine is powered by a gasoline oil
mixture and its 20-ounce tank will run the generator for about an hour.

Until now, generators have either been heavy and powerful or small and weak.
The next closest generator that produces wattage comparable to the Lightening
EPU weighs 51 pounds and produces 650 watts.

The company expects wide use of the product in emergency or disaster situations
to power small freezers, lights and radios.

The lightening series of generators were born as a defense conversion project
through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  Active Technologies
designed and developed a small high-performance alternator for a remote-
controlled model airplane, used to draw fire and identify anti-aircraft installations.

The key to packing so much power into such a small package is found in rare
earth magnets made of neodymium iron boron.  All the compoanies products are
manufactured entirely in the U.S.

the Lightning EPU is now available at a variety of dealers across the country.
Dealers locations may be obtained by calling Active Technologies, INC.,
at 1.800545.5348 or by writing to 1117 LaVelle Road, Alamorgordo, NM 88310.
