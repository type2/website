This guy emailed me privately.  He said he didn't mind if I posted it to
the list.  I hope it's appropriate.

&gt; 
&gt; Dear David,
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Nelson and I am a VW salesman in Raleigh, NC.  A friend of mine
&gt; and me are trying to get a VW commemorative plate to go thru the state
&gt; legislature for approval.  The state requires 300 signatures.  I was
&gt; wondering if there was a way that you could maybe help me get a hold of VW
&gt; owners in the state of North Carolina.  The plate would look like a regular
&gt; plate but with the VW logo followed by V then 0001, 0002 and so on.  I have
&gt; already gotten the OK from my VW representative.  All we need now are
&gt; signatures of people would would agree to get a plate once it becomes
&gt; available.
&gt; 
&gt; I would appreciate any help or information that you can give me,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,  Nelson  (NENauss_at_AOL.COM)
&gt; You can call me (9am to 9pm EST) 1-800-489-0901
