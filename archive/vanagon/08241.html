  Sorry I'm late with my 2 cents worth but...
	BOSCH 100w osram 8&quot; dia. chrome or black plastic  $30 each
	Where?  KMart, yes, KMart
	Also, most parts stores have a pair of 6&quot; dia. lights called
	Baja I think for about $30.  They start at 55w but for a few
	bucks, you can upgrade them to 100w halogen, very nice...
	In the end, two cheap small fog lights upgraded to 100w on the
	the back bumper make great back-up/ back-off lights. Works great.

	P.S.  If you are worried about power, my '78 powers all lights
	      and a cd player with two amps just fine.
