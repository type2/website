Subject: Re- '76 Bus for sale

&gt; &gt;HEY,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE TO PART WITH MY 1976 BUS 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND HAD TRIPLETS.

&gt; &gt;P.S.SHE'S IN CHERRY SHAPE.

&gt;After having triplets???  Or did he mean the bus?

And if a few years, he'll have to buy one back again to carry the kids and all
their support stuff!

Harvey
No apologies, just reality.
