So James Cook says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The only critical thing is to bleed the radiator, this should
&gt; &gt; solve your problems, pull the grill, it should be obvious how,
&gt; &gt; 1/4 twist screws I think. lool on one side on top for larke
&gt; &gt; bleeder valve, looks like a tire valve but big, like an A/C fill
&gt; &gt; valve, press till H20 appears, problem solved. 

Now this is interesting.  My bleeder valve is just a bolt.  Is this
tire valve type a year specific item or did someone do a custom
job on your radiator?

&gt; Thank you.   And I've already put in Prestone brand coolant (without the 
&gt; required tilting procedures, etc.) The container doesn't indicate if it 
&gt; is phosphate free. Does anyone know if it is....... or whether it's 
&gt; safe...... or whether I should flush it somehow?
&gt; 

I wouldn't recommend the Prestone (pee green) stuff unless it specifically
states on the jug that it is indeed phosphate free.  As a matter of fact,
if I were you, I'd completely drain what you have in there now and get
the right stuff from VW.  Pay the money, it's much cheaper than having
to pay for the replacement heads and other excess damage that you will
incur if you don't.
