&gt; After watching some of you guys beat your heads (or chests) to get your
&gt; original battery fridge running, I'm curious if there are ANY out there
&gt; that work.
&gt;
&gt; I, personally, have never seen one operational and ripped mine out in
&gt; favor of extra storage space and a propane bench fridge behind the
&gt; passenger seat.....
&gt;
&gt; So, does anyone have an operational fridge from a '76-'79 Westy?

Nope.

Is this a vote thing or did you just want the affirmatives?
