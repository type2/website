Met a guy last night at a gas station who was driving a '71 Westfalia
clone.  Anyway, a while back he bought a '69 bus for parts. He used
the engine and tranny, but there are a lot of other good parts on it.
He says he'll be in town next week for a few days, then he is heading
for Costa Rica with the '71 Westfalia.  He says he wouldn't travel
down there in anything else.

If you want his parts (don't know what he wants for them), call him
next week at (619) 275-7519.
