Subject: another catalog


Anoter SUPER catalog is from Real Goods, in Ukiah, CA 1.800.762.7325.
They feature UHBELIEVABLE solar and alternative energy things, including
for $2K, a robot solar lawnmower  :).  They in fact also have
an inflatable 2 person solar heating spa, that has the 
possibility of adding a 12v bubbler.  Have at it, nerds!
