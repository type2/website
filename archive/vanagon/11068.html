I thought you were supposed to have a big tank for spraying, like 20-30 gallons 
minimum. But if it works...what the hey!

My VW's all have good paint, but I've got a shell of a 2002 that's stripped and 
ready to paint. Well, maybe the paint needs to be roughed up and feathered a 
bit, but that's about it. It's got &quot;come spray me&quot; written all over it.

I'm willing to guinea-pig away! Want an all expense paid trip to 
beautiful.....San Jose?

&gt; Awhile back, I'd posted how I took a 3/4HP air compressor and fitted
&gt; a 7 gallon tank to it, to use for general air needs and for painting.
&gt; Tonight I tried it out &quot;for real&quot; and shot some sealer onto the bus.
&gt; Worked excellent, with both my small detail gun and my full sized 
&gt; professional gun.  The only thing I have to watch for is to not 
&gt; spray too continuously, or my pressure starts to drop.  I have a regulator
&gt; on the system, so idle time is no problem.   I had none of the 
&gt; air starvation problems I had when I painted my last bus, which I did with
&gt; this compressor, but without the tank.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I'm all hot and bothered to paint something!  Any guinea pigs out there?
&gt; I guestimate that with a pre-prepped car, you could take 3 hours or so
&gt; to mask it, shoot it, and then let it dry for a day (depending on the paint
&gt; system) and be done.  Mind you, on my bus I'll be using a basecoat-clearcoat
&gt; system, and painting everything inside and out and underneath!
