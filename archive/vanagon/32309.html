Subject: Parts is Part WEb page??	

Hi y'all

anyone know the url for aprts is parts (they make repro wood slat roofracks
for older type II's). i know i have seen their ad in the rag's so if anyone
had one close at hand their url should be on their ad.

it is something like

or something like that

much appreciated!

michael
