Subject: Tune Up Advice Needed
Date: Tue, 15 Jul 1997 23:42:57 -0700

I am giving my newly purchased '85 Westie a standard &quot;tune up&quot; in a few
days. My local shop wanted $220 for this so I am doing it myself. I plan
to:

Replace oil and filter 
Replace air filter
Replace distributor &amp; cap
Replace plugs (Bentley says to gap these at .028, Autolite says .044 -
anyone know who is right?)
Replace gas filter 

I also plan to adjust the timing and idle. Any tricks to know about
this? I know to do the timing first. Bentley says to adjust the timing
at 2000-2500 RPM. Is this correct? 

Am I missing anything else? I am used to Mazda Pickups and not yet
intimate with VWs.
