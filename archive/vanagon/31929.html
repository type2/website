Subject: RE: VWs in ads


&gt; My favorite commercial was one I saw in the OK City, Okla area back about
&gt; 1987 or so.  It was for the Contact Lens Association ??? or something
&gt; similar.  It was several B/W images including a 356 Porsche towards the
&gt; beginning and at the end, I seem to recall it had an image of a photo-
&gt; grapher roller-skating around a 1955 to 1957 black oval window VW.

My own favorite has to be the ad done by VW themselves, to sell Volkswagens
of course, so it's not much of a surprise that it featured a beetle (duh!).
This was back in the late '60s or early '70s. It showed a Beetle floating in
a swimming pool, not sinking, while the announcer droned on about how
airtight the body was, lightweight, etc. etc.

The best part was actually a spoof on this ad, done by National Lampoon
magazine, and placed inside the front cover of the issue where you often
expect to find real, legitimate ads. It showed a beetle floating in a pool,
same camera angles, shading, etc., but had no VW logo in the corner as
a legit had would have had. The caption read, &quot;If Teddy Kennedy had driven
a Volkswagen, he'd be President by now.&quot;


Another excellent ad done by VW didn't even have a car in it. It was
designed to tout the VW's excellent economy, and simply showed a gas
station. The caption read, &quot;Last one in is a Volkswagen&quot;.


Anyone else recall any memorable &quot;cute&quot; or otherwise funny ads from the
past, from VW or not?
