Subject: More Ben and Jerry's info

    For those you are unfamilar with the Ben and Jerry's VW show Here's the
scoop. We're going to start the weekend with a campout at Limehurst lake
CA. The number for the campground is (802) 433-6662.  We have made
arrangments with Limehurst owners to camp in the Safari field. There is
water and electric there if needed and the bath room is close by.  The
showers are a little farther away near the office. The campground also has
a waterslide.   If you wanted a site of your own please feel free to call
and make a reservation.  There should be plenty of space in the field for
all.   I will be arriving Friday nite, the 7th.  We are also going to have
a LiMBO sponsored Cookout. LiMBO will have hamburgs and hot dogs and sweet
sausage.  All that is needed will be some side dishes.  If you would like
to bring one, great.   BYOB.   There will be a campfire, maybe songs and
definitly stories.  This usually is a good camping event. (Just as good as
Transporters by the Tunnel)   This is also a great time for list members to
get together.

   Ben and Jerrys is up the highway from Limehurst Lake about 15 minutes .
The factory is right off intestate 89 about 3 miles.  (look for signs)  The
show itself is informal.  There will be a longest distance traveled award,
greasiest engine, most maps and rustiest VW awards.  There will also be a
DJ, me, with music from the '60s to the '90s. (nothing heavy)  It should be
an relaxed and enjoyable day and I hope to see you there. (look for me in a
beige '82 camper)  any questions, just drop me a note.  Take care.
