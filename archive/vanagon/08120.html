Hi, Derek. I, too, am a big fan of VW's Syncro technology. I once took some
Arizona Jeep Jockeys through the rock country around Sedona in a VW Syncro
Van, and they were amazed by its capabilities. I've forwarded your question
to Tech Whiz Sly and expect we'll have an answer for you soon.
Do I want to get massive amounts of mail from van owners? You bet. Talk to
you soon.
