Subject: 57 pt check up

My buddy the service guy at one of the local (Phoenix) VW dealers said to
throw the card away. The post cards are computer generated and are a cross
marketing ~ rententative advertising method to drag customers back into the
dealership. If everything is OK (and properly maintained) by you then nuke
the card. If you have the time and inclination then go for it! I do not
intend give a blanket comdemnation to vehicle maintenance. Quite the
contrary... 
I figure out of 57 points they are sure to find &quot;something&quot; that needs
IMMEDIATE ATTN! ;-)
