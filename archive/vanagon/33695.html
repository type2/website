No VW content!!!

Someone mentioned Cunningham's Museum in Costa Mesa.  
Not there any more.  Cars sold :(  Was there.  Rode
w/ Mr. John Burgess in Mr. Cunningham's BuMerc (Mercedes
SSK w/ Buick straight 8) and his '29 Packard Roadster.
The great thing about that &quot;museum&quot; was that ALL the
cars were driven every couple of weeks.  No garage queens!
Also, all were significant examples of automotive excellence.
Okay, some VW content...  My favorite was the 904 Porsche.
Silver, of course.
