So Bradley says:

&gt; &gt; I do prefer to bring along an ice chest as well just because the 
&gt; &gt; fridge is too small.  Even for weekend trips.
&gt; 
&gt; What's wrong Steve?   You can't fit enough beer in the fridge?
&gt; 

Well..actually..no....  I can't fit enough beer in the fridge.
As a matter of fact, If I filled the whole van with ice and beer,
there still wouldn't be enough beer!!  ;)
