Subject: Address change for VW forsale www site

Hi volksfolks:

I posted a message a day or two ago about Demented Dworkin's
used bus bits in which I mentioned the address of a page
someone set up to buy/sell VW stuff.  The address has of
course since changed, so here's the new one:

http://www.dsv.su.se/~fred-han/adds.html

The page has been totally reorganized, and looks pretty good.

Mark
