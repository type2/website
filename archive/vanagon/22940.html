Subject: RE: Rebuild question.

Ben:  If your diagnosing your engine for rebuild potential, check St. Muir's
Compleat Idiots guide for a do-it-yourself diagnostic.  At a minimum, this 
means to check the compression (Sears handy-doody fer $30).  How many miles
on the engine may help you to decide to do a top-end rebuild or to go all
out (not to mention &quot;available funds&quot;).  If you've determined that you can
get away with replacing the heads, that's about $150-$200 per head....
Hope this helps
