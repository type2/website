By the way, everybody should buy their battery wiring supplies through Ron
(owner) of Wrangler Power Products of Scottsdale, Arizona. Get his catalog.
It is superb for this purpose. Has relays, connectors, sleving, soldering and
crimping tools, heavy gague welding wire, etc.

Also, get the catalog from Ample Power Products of, I think, Seattle
Washington.
