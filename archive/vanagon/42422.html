&gt;BTW, I've been a Pennzoil SAE 30 man since the day I bought the bus, 
&gt;and yesterday all my parts place had was Castrol 30.  I bought it.  I 
&gt;still feel uneasy about it.  My only experience with another brand 
&gt;oil was the fiasco with Valvoline Synthetic.  ACK.   Anyone else out 
&gt;there running Castrol?  Good?  Bad?  Ugly?
&gt;
&gt;

For many many years, Castrol has been considered the Standard for protecting
small, high stressed Engines.  I used it exclusively for years until I
started to used Mobil 1.  I am curious about your Valvoline synthetic fiasco.
 Could you send me some information.  Synthetics seem to get balmed for
things they relly did not cause.  Maybe I could shed some light.
