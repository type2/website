&gt;&gt; &gt; between 70 and 80 mph.  Ever notice the way that a 
&gt;diesel 
&gt;&gt; &gt; loosens out after 50 or 60 miles?  And that it revs 
&gt;better with 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; engine just runs *better* after an hour. It is 
&gt;quieter (or I am deafer)
&gt;&gt; and runs much more smoothly....

&gt;Well, I guess there's three of us lunatics here.  Mine 
&gt;runs better after  about 70 miles or so.  Strange 
&gt;thing, but there must be a reason for it.

Welcome to the loony-bin, Stuart.  You want your intravenous 
anti-freeze now or after lunch? :)

&gt;I've pretty well decided that truck drivers know this already 
and 
&gt;therefore  let the engines run all night, even when it is not 
cold outside. 

I've been told by a Bubba that it's 'coz they've forgotten 
where the key goes...   (Ouch!)
