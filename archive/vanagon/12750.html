&gt; &gt;You know the ones I mean ..... as advertised in J.C.
&gt; &gt;Whitney and the most recent issue of Cool VW's.
&gt; 
&gt; yup. it helps a lot at low rpm. so you don't have to sit at red lights,
&gt; running the engine at 3000 rpm just to get some air flow.  get a good one;
&gt; someone suggested a bilge fan from a boating supply place.
&gt; 

I run one and it works fine when the weather doesn't get below 25
degrees. Something else I use is one of the mini heaters you can buy
at any hardware store for 19.95. It is of course 110AC but I slapped
together a little power converter (inverter?) circuit to change the
12V DC to the 110AC. Draws about 360 watts on super high (12VDC 30
Amps) and 120 watts on low (12VDC 10 Amps).

If enough of you want, I could slap together a crude schematic and
post it on the group. Or email me and I can do the same. I've had it
for a couple years and when I built it, it cost somewhere around $30.
You can also buy one from J.C. Whitney though I don't remember the
price. I also ran a heavier wire directly to the battery (yes, with an
inline fuse) so as not to fry any wiring. Just playing it safe.

Hope this helps.

Lates,
Greg
