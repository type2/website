Hmmm... do they check?  I not insured right now, and there's only a 50/50 
chance that I will be in the next year.  But I'd like to go to Canada.

&gt; &gt;list of authorized VW dealers
&gt; And unauthorized alternatives which are often cheaper and better.  I'd like
&gt; to have such a list whether I travel on this trip or not.  Particularly for
&gt; the Pacific Northwest.  

I doubt that VW has much left for my bus.  I plan on bringing all the 
stuff I might need, and a 2.5 gallon gas can just in case.

On the topic of daily mileage, I would like to suggest 200-400 MPD (Miles 
per Day).  And for the start of the trip I thinkthe So. Cal people should 
drive up to the SFO area in one day.  Then we can all go up to Oregon, 
possibly WA on the next day.  I only work part-time, so I don't have 
vacation time.  That means I don't get paid while away, so I can only 
afford one month away.

Gassing up will have to be fairly frequent.  I'll need gas AT LEAST every 
200 miles.  10.5 Gals only goes so far.

Everyone else is putting out a list... maybe I should too.  A summery of 
the list is:

Personal items. (Clothing, Paperwork, etc)
Camping items. (Tent, tarp, stove, lights)
Bus items.. (parts, parts, and more parts)
