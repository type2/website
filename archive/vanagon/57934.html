Subject: Re: Rusty seams

Hello Lloyd.   I do believe there is a product for just the 
application you want.  

Mar-hyde made a Fast Drip Check Sealer (#7001) that is designed to 
flex and be paintable.  No need for primer... this stuff goes over 
bare metal.  Use *flexible* paintable primer on top, and then paint 
(either by brush or spray if you wish).

Excert from the box:

..... fast curing, fast setting seam sealer that adheres to all 
surfaces, skins in 2 - 3 minutes, and is paintable in 30 minutes.  
Self-leveling properties makes tool marks and edges disappear.  
Excellent for stopping all types of water and wind leaks.  ....  
Final set is very tough and elastic - will not crack or peel

I've used this a few years ago now without any problems reoccurring.  
I purchased this stuff from an auto body supply store... I believe it 
was $10 or so CDN.

Hope this helps.
Harry.
