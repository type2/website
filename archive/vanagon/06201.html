&gt; Dave Black &lt;dblack_at_argus.lowell_dot_edu&gt; asks:
&gt; 
&gt; So, which is more severe, 10 miles in stop and go traffic, or 50 miles at
&gt; 65mph, through mountainous, sometimes freezing conditions?
&gt;

	IMHO, 10 miles stop and go. The engine doesn't make much heat in
stop and go, so the oil probably doesn't warm up until the end of the trip,
if at all. Plus wear on the clutch and brakes. Cold outside, even freezing,
isn't bad for a running car. If you can make a steady 65, it ain't that
mountainous!
