Subject: synthetic oil for syncro front transmiss


Happy winter all!

My 87 Syncro van has 150,000 mi on it, but according to the owner's manual 
and bentley all I should do is check transmission oil levels and replace if 
necessary.  Why not change it?  I am going to change the rear transmission 
oil (it only has about 25,000 miles) and replace it with Mobil 1 synthetic. 
 Would there be any reason not to do this on the front tranny?

Thanks again,
Fred Porter
