OK, I know sales ads are not nice here, but these two make the 
perfect argument that I always tell my GF:
FOR SALE: 1971 Volkswagon bus

\Great project vehicle for the mechanically inclined.  Engine runs, but
\needs to be rebuilt or replaced.  Otherwise, the car is in excellent
\condition.  Rear seat folds down into platform for a bed.  Very low
\mileage (125K miles), two new tires.
\Asking $550 or b/o.

\Email replies to jhwang_at_isl.stanford_dot_edu (not this account please!)
\or phone (415) 321-8141 evenings before 9pm.
\------------------------------
\******** 1984 VW Vanagon Camper *************
\* Low miles - 84K
\* A/C
\* Sleeps 4
\* Good Condition
\* Stove, Sink, and Refrigerator
\  Ligh Brown Color, every thing original
\*********** Asking $7400


Now, I own a '71 Bus. How much fixing on it do you think that I could
have done for $7,000? Prob. a lot, even if I let someone else
do it. We are talking new paint, suspension, powertrain,
rubber, controlls, and prob. buy and instll all the extra
camping goodies (even though I shy away from them and pack
my own) This is why I tell my GF it would be better to spend $5,000
and get a more reliable and comfortable and FUN bug than her
$8000 Hyundai.
