I have a theory, based only on my own experience, that unstable (high) 
idle in Vanagons can be caused by too rich a mixture.  I was experiencing 
the same problem; I replaced the O2 sensor, spark plugs, plug wires, 
distributor cap, found a working idle stabilizer, etc. and still had the 
unstable idle.  Finally determined that the air sensor was such that it 
COULD NOT be &quot;leaned&quot; enough to get the idle mixture into spec.  After 
fixing that (tightened the return spring in the sensor) the idle's be 
rock-steady.
