Subject: Re: Needed - EV Oil Filters


Ok...ok...got to rub it in....  ;-)

About a year and a half ago or so, one of the early vanagon list members 
(forgot his name) was being transferred (by the military) to Alaska. He sold 
his EV and bought a Chebby Suburban and headed north....not before selling 
me 6 OEM VW EV filters for $25!!   &lt;gloat....gloat...gloat&gt;...

I still have 4 of them left....mainly because I've let the dealer change the 
oil a number of times...they have a deal for $19.00 they change the oil and 
filter (its a coupon thing they send every couple of months)...so I drop the 
EV off with a 6 pack of mobil1 and tell them to change the oil...but use my 
Mobil1. It still works out cheaper because I get the filter and labor out of 
them...and they have to deal with the oily mess.

Last month, I dropped the EV off...with my filter and my Mobil1...but didn't 
have a cupon...they charged me $5.00 for labor to change the oil! 

For all you folks who bitch and moan about their VW dealers...the key is 
that you have to train these folks...and a six pack of decent beer once in a 
while doesn't hurt either!
