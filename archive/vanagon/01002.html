Subject: 73 1700 van timing questions

        I recently acquired a '73 1700 van.  I need to know to where, when
static timing per Mr. Muir's guide for idiots' instructions, I should be
timing it.  I believe it is 5 degrees BTDC, but want to be sure as the
Muir's guide does not list the static timing for my model.
        On a related problem, does anyone out there know 1) why it is that
so many morons insist on throwing out the timing bracket at some point in
all vans' lives and 2) where I can get one for less than the $35.00 that
the dealer wants (no where else in Austin has them and I've had no luck
with salvage yards.)  I'm not convinced that the current 0 degree mark is
correct.
        Incidentally, if anyone happens to have their' timing bracket
pulled off at some point, I would be happy to pay for a photocopy of
it...painting 0 degrees+the appropriate timing mark would produce wild
heaven for this VW owner...even if it meant leaving the dealer )-=

Thanks.  Mark Setzler
