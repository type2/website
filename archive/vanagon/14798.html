Don't know hat's happening with the folks east of the Mississippi.

There have been one or two &quot;attempts&quot; to get an organized effort but all seems to 
fizzle away.

I'm planning to take some time off and go as far west as time (and etc.) will permit to 
join the trek.

It'll be a shame of the Eastern leg dies for lack of interest and support. I offered to do 
something to plan, coordinate or whatever but, again, everything seemed to just fade 
into a &quot;silent&quot; demise.
