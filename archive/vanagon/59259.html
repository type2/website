Michael,

I don't have the tires in front of me, but I think they are 205-70R14 (they
are the stock wide tires that VW put on the vans).

30-40 is the pressure balance VW recommends for the 205's.    Max inflation
for the MXLs is 40 lbs, I believe.

&gt;I have a couple of questions ...
&gt;
&gt;What is the complete designation for the tire size you are using?  What is
the maximum tire 
&gt;inflation pressure stamped on the sidewalls of your tires?
&gt;
&gt;Why are you running 40/30 psi tire pressures?  What does the owner's
manual say for tire 
&gt;pressures?
&gt;
