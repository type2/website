Subject: 23 Window AUS price

The first 23 window deluxe sunroof that I have seen for sale in the last 18
months in AUS (Melbourne anyway) was auctioned at Hamiltons (exotic/vintage
auction house) last week.  It was in *very* ordinary/poor condition......

And the price it sold for?

$12000 AUS or around $8800 US.....

Makes you weep doesn't it?
