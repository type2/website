&gt;I have found what has got to be the lowest prices on Bentleys that I have
&gt;seen in a long time and it is from all places J.C. WHITNEY!!!  They had
&gt;actual photographs of three of the manuals, not Artists conceptions,
&gt;and_appeared_to be unretouched.  They are as follows:
&gt;
&gt;63-67    $72.99     84XK0977Y    (Bus Boys P/N  ZAB-V267)
&gt;
&gt;68-79    $28.99     16XK6225R    (Bus Boys P/N  ZAB-V279)
&gt;
&gt;80-92    $65.99     16XK6901N    (Bus Boys P/N  ZAV-VV91) (Actually covers
thru 1991 not 1992)

Looks like Warshawsky beat us to the punch.  We've got a two month special
(July &amp; August) runnin' on these manuals for the same prices.  Anyone out
there can call us and get these manuals for the same price (It was a special
one-time buy direct from Bentley).  SOTO, NEATO and VANAGON_at_LENTI Member
discounts are not allowed during this special pricing.  No gimmicks - just
good buying and good pricing. :)

Prices good thru August 31, 1995

Keep 'em runnin' :)
