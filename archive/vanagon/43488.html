We've just installed a VDO dipstick oil temp sensor and gauge. Temp runs 
about 220 until protracted running on highway at 60-65 mph then up to 260 
and takes an age to return. This seems too hot to me. What should normal 
temp be? What can be done to keep temp down? What might cause of overheat 
be?
