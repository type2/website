Subject: Vanagon Map Light &amp; Silver Socket installation

Vanagonians:

Over the weekend I completed the installation of a map light and
silver socket at the rear of the van. The map light is a 5W, flex
stem unit from JCWhipme that cost $15.00 (the same light in West
Coast Marine cost $30.00). I've mounted it in the shelf above the
engine hatch by the A/C evaporator. This works nicely, the lamp
is up out of the way when not needed and can be bent down and aimed
over the rear cushion, should be perfect for reading in bed. The 
silver socket had been mounted up by the steering column which I 
never used. It is now mounted in a 7/8&quot; hole that I drilled into
the cabinet, looks stock. The socket is for a 12V hand held spot
light, should be handy when working on the engine or changing a
tire.

I wired the socket and the lamp together and ran the wire up to the 
auxiliary battery under the driver seat. I used a 1/2&quot;, 15' clear
plastic tube as a conduit to protect the wire, actually I pulled through
another wire which I could use for a back up light. The plastic tube
conduit runs down the center of the van, under the floor, above the
gas tank and under the driver seat. I mushed the hydrogen gas breather
tube a little and pushed the conduit up beside it. I then resealed 
the gaps with some GE silicone sealant. 

Coming off the auxiliary battery I've installed a separate fuse
distribution panel. This replaces the fuse that went to the silver
socket for the portable frig (this is a weekender). My intent is
to eventually wire all camping related electrical accessories (frig,
fluorescent light, radio, map light) from this panel.
