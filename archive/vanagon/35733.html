Subject: 100,000 mile tune-ups

A friend of mine just bought a '96 Grand Caravan with the 3.8 (?) L 
V6.            a walk-thru.   :)

Here's some observations:
- i saw he had 237 miles on it and told him in my usual non-directive 
manner to get his oil changed.  now.  he told me the Plymouth service 
manager said not to have it changed until 3,500 miles are up.  after 
applying compresses to the  burst veins on my forehead, my friend 
related the service managers explanation of there being 'a special 
coating on the rings' that needs the friction of old oil to break-in 
properly.....  grrrrrr.  old arguement.  comments anyone?

- tune-ups are scheduled for 100K due to some Zircon-encrusted double 
ended spark plugs or something.  gimme my annual (or is it anal?) plug changes, 
please.  i just FEEL better.

- the side door has a 'new' latch that holds the door open on 
inclines.....   hrumpf.  new.  yeah, right.

Not intending flame bait, but this van IS nice.  gobs of power. 
quiet.  good mileage.  new.  it does what it was designed for and
does it well. i might buy one if i had the cash.   but as Csabe
Csabre (or some other C&amp;D editor) said, &quot;Not only does it not give
good bed, it doesn't give bed at all.&quot;

-dan '87 Westy (that gives GREAT bed)
