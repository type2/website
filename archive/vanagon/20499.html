It seems I've generated some confucious about my web page.

NetCom ain't got no WWW server, so their FAQ sez to put your pages in 
an FTP directory.  This I did, and tried it out with Mosaic, and all was
well.  Well, thats if you can get in!  _I_ couldn't this morning!

If anyone has any suggestions on how to make  this less painful for evryone,
I'm all ears (can you say &quot;Ross Perot?&quot;  I _knew_ you could!!)

I' _really_ new to the web, so go easy on me!

If there are some of you that are newer than I, and have a shell account,
ya gotta check out this thing called Slirp!
