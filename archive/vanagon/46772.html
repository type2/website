Subject: Inuvik departure party

Everybody (not just Inuvik trekkers),

Under one week before the bunch of us pull out of Vancouver monday morning,
so I'm sure all of you Inuvik trekkers are pretty stoked.  I know I am!

Just to let you all know Christa and I will have a party at our place
Sunday night (July 21st), to send us off right.  Since we will be getting
an early start the next morning, things will kick off at 6:00 pm.  This
earlier time will also work for folks who have to work Monday AM.  I hope
all the trekkers that will be leaving Vancouver the next morning can get to
my place in time to take in the festivities.

Of course, any vanagon_at_lenti or type2_at_primenet folks in the Vancouver/PNW
area who'd like to come and meet list folks in &quot;real life&quot; are welcome.  I
live in the West End of Vancouver.  Call me at (604) 689-2660 for
directions to my place.  Please RSVP if you plan to come so Christa and I
can estimate the food we will need to set up.  If folks want to bring some
food to share, that'd be fine, but please tell us so we don't buy too much
food ourselves.  We will be supplying yummy vegetarian food (some diary,
possible fish, but we'll tell you what's what) to all who come.  Please
notify about any food allergies.

I've reserved 14 parking spaces at my place, but Inuvik trekkers get dibs
on the first dozen or so.  There is legal street parking across the street
from me starting at 6:00 pm, but these spaces tend to fill up fast, so
there's some incentive to arrive at exactly 6:00 so you can nab a spot
before all the other riff-raff do.

Many folks may be especially interested to hear that several VW factory
reps will also be at the party, since they heard about the trip, thought it
sounded like fun, they called me, and I invited them.  Please don't bite
them, but this might be a good opportunity to scold them for putting the
Eurovan's engine in the wrong end.  ;-)

Now, just so you folks all know, Christa and I live in a one bedroom
apartment on the 13th floor of a high-rise.  We have a good sized balcony
and all, but I have to say we've never had 50 people in our apartment
before.  We may move the party down to the garden area at street level;
it'll all work out one way or the other, and we'll have a great time.

I hope a lot of the local people can make it.  We'll have to shut the party
down by 11:00 (I can't believe I'm saying this!), since we'll have to be up
by 6:00 to get a clean start on the longest driving day of the Inuvik trip.

Northward ho!

Tobin and Christa
