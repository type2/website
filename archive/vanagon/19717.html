So Harvey Chao says:
&gt; 
&gt; I think I'd go with the local guy.  That way if anything goes wrong, you
&gt; can complain to them directly.  GEX is in the mags, but I rather (if I
&gt; had to) be able to get in the persons face if something goes wrong and
&gt; they're not willing to fix it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW - I look at it from a different view - At least in theory, the GEX
&gt; engines are completly rebuilt on a production line basis.  That means
&gt; standardization and experience.   How many rebuilds on this type of engine
&gt; does the local guy do, and when was the last one done?  If the GEX blows up
&gt; underwarranty, and your local guy is reputable, you should have no problem. 
&gt; If it is out of warranty - you are probably on your own in any case.  Based on
&gt; an insignificant sample size of 1 -  when I needed a longblock to replace my
&gt; vanagon diesel, the GEX route was the most cost effective, and since
&gt; rebuilding VW diesels is not common to most shops, a production rebuild seemed
&gt; to offer the best chance of a good product.

You're probably right, although, there are some very good local guys,
I prefer someone who does it daily or assembly line.  I guess the other
reason I said the local guy too was because one of the local rebuilders
is a very good one.
