&gt;... doing 35 in a 25 and a 50 in a 45 when I had the 72 bus.  I guess you can
&gt;get away with it if you are doing over 60 because nobody believes that you can
&gt;go that fast.

i always wondered about that. in my 71 bus, i NEVER got pulled over for
speeding, even though i would blast down the roads at 70 mph. and i could go
right past the cops in a group of cars ... it was like all they saw was the
vw bus and figured we couldn't be going that fast.

got pulled over once for suspected drunken driving, though ... the wind was
blowing me alllll over the road. i think they just were p.o.'d because i had
a vw bus with tint on the windows.

now ... when i got my vanagon in 1980, all the sudden i started getting
stopped pretty regular by the state troopers. it was like they didn't know
it was a vw! luckily, i was working for the alabama supreme court at the
time ... :)  a little 'professional' courtesy goes a long way.

since then, however, i have learned the error of my ways ... i don't flog
my poor little engine anymore and i don't go very fast on the roads. well,
not very often anyway. or maybe it's just that everybody else is going faster
nowadays. ?
