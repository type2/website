this was too good to pass up....

from v. 10, no. 1 of Government Technology, page 58:

... and i Quote:

As they close on the bulk before them, the officer gives the orders to
extend the harpoon and lock it in place.  He holds his breath as the
distance slowly narrows.  He grips the wheel, perspiration beads his brow.
Suddenly, with a lunge, the barbed head plunges deep into the vitals of a
white Saab.

If Det. Sgt. Markku Limingoja of the City Police Department of Oulu,
Finland, has his way, the whaler's harpoon will soon become a law
enforcement tool, spearing fleeing vehicles and dragging them to a halt.  If
the driver still attempts to get away, tear gas can be pumped through the
hollow harpoon into the vehicle ahead.  If all else fails, the harpoon can
be severed, leaving a satellite homing device stuck into the trunk of the
vehicle.

The harpoon is attached to the front of the patrol cars, tucked in just
above the bumper.  An electric motor swings it into position and the harpoon
is then rammed into the pursued vehicle.  A speed of only two to three kmph
above that of the other vehicle is sufficient to implant the device.

Det. Sgt. Limingoja desinged and developed the &quot;car harpoon.&quot;  It is
currently in prototype with plans to manufacture it commercially within a year.

For more information, write to Veijo Iivonen, deputy trade commissioner at :
Trade Commission of Finland,
