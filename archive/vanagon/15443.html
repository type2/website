Thanks to all for your advice on FI computers for my '77 Westy.  My local 
(Portland OR) mechanic found a used one for $150, and for the short ride 
home at least, the bucking problem appears to be finally solved.

Regarding the suggestion to switch to carberation, I don't recommend it; 
ordinarily my FI has been virtually trouble free, and the van always 
starts.  Besides, I'm finally beginning to have confidence in my 
understanding of the FI system.  It's really not all that complicated.
