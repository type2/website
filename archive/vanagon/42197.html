WA&gt;	Friends,
WA&gt;	Here in the USA, metric taps and dies are harder to come
WA&gt;by than good ole' brand X. Faced with $25 and a special order for
WA&gt;a 13mm tap, I'd be tempted to use a 1/2&quot; tap and nice cheap 1/2&quot;

Buy the Harbor Freight $15 40 pc set can really save you but
in a pinch, better yet buy the higher qulity $45 set.

The time I've saved with even the $15 set amazes me and I've never
broken one with VERY careful use.

John
