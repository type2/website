Subject: Update on ye old '80 ASI

Just a little word on how my parting the camper is going.
Well, I pulled the interior yesterday.  If anyone needs the water tank, 
hand pump or electric pump, let me know.  Again, from an ASI conversion.

Today I plan on pulling all the windows, and cutting the roof off.  I 
think I'll video tape me cutting with the metal blade in the skill saw.  :)
