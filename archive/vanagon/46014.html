Subject: I'm jeolous!

My dad bought a '78 Westy today, and I'm jeolous!  He now has 3 Vdubs to my 2
(I just sold my '69 Bug).  To top it off I'm the one who has been talking
about getting a Westy.  I think he is just being spiteful.  Anyway, you guys
should be happy to know that another classy VW is in the hands of a true VW
lover and not being abused by just another driver.

By the way, the '78 has a solid body (no rust or bondo) and interior, and it
runs strong and smooth.  It is complete and everything works.  My dad paid
$3000.  Is this a good price?
