Subject: Vanagon 1600 cases?? WAS: Q: More on buying bus 82 1.6 vs 2

&gt; Michael &amp; Chris
&gt; PS: Its not a mistake or typo, the 1,600cc engines are available in Europe!
&gt; 

So it is you lucky dog, I'm going to make a couple general 
statements, the 2000cc stock is a DOG in a Vanagon particularly in a 
Westy, for US use on Interstates grades, or around mountainous areas it is 
damn near slow as a 1500 split.  So the 1600 would simply be 
terrible, BUT except for the fact that it is in a MAJORLY neat case 
featuring a built in spin on full flow oil filter, the Vanagon 
installation of the 1600 is basically your good ole type 1 engine 
subject to the incredible availability of high performance parts to 
build quality and reliable engines well over 2.0 liters.  Much easier 
and cheaper to build the hi-po T1 compared to the T4 and parts prices 
will always be less, availability more.  If I might ask you, do you 
have any idea if that 1600 is an aluminum case? we had recently been 
discussing the possibility as obviously it was an entirely new casting 
and it seems to make sense that VW after realizing the benefits of 
the alloy used in the T4 case, might have used it to cast Vanagon 
1600 cases, if so those things would be the ultimate T1 case 
commanding incredible $$$, built in full flow filtration and perhaps 
an aluminum case would be a dream.  It seems from the Haynes that 
they even use hydraulic lifters, FROM THE FACTORY, I ask in general 
why have these cases not made it into the US, seems like the factory 
built the ultimate T1 case, if someone could latch onto the tooling 
and start pumping them out, they could make a mint, I'd bet you could 
sell em for about $700 a pop, considering a replacement is going $350 
and a Scat billet case is over $1000.  Considering $350 + $250 + $100 
for a new case, hydraulic lifter conversion, and full flow filtration 
system, hell you might even get $800+
