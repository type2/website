Subject: Re: how do I get O2 sensor out?

In a message dated 96-07-24 17:47:52 EDT, you write:

&gt;, the bosch for the '87 is around $140.  The reason I ask is that when 
&gt;I called busboys, they first quoted ma e price  for the '85 O2 sensor 
&gt;which is about half the price of the '87 sensor.  I assume that there 
&gt;must be some difference.

I think the pre-86 ones did not have the built-in heating element.
