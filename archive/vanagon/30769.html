From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; I have an idea that I'd like to toss out to the list community. I've always 
&gt; maintained an alter of sorts on the dash of my bus. A rolling history of my 
&gt; travels. My alter tends to be natural in origin: wildflowers, leaves, 
&gt; sticks, stones, bones, kelp, sea shells, etc. with the occasional plastic 
&gt; novelty thrown in for good humor.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is to create a &quot;VW Bus Dashboard Alters&quot; web page with photos of 
&gt; various dashboard alters. I'm willing to host the page if there is enough 
&gt; interest. Let me know (nicely) if this idea is too weird or crazy or boring, 
&gt; or...
Be careful, as in some states, Virginia for instance, it is illegal to
have items hanging from the rear-view mirror, and generally impeding
your view of the road. It's one of those laws they use to stop
&quot;suspicious&quot; vehicles, like busses, and search them without consent,
since you've already broken the law...
Richard
