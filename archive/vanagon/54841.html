Subject: RE: Blizzaks on the EV 

I am a big fan of putting the most tire possible on a vehicle.

Plus, Volkswagon/Audi typically undertires their vehicles.

Therefore, I recommend using reinforced tires on Vanagons.

As for EV's, I have no idea what they take.  But, if VW specifies reinforced tires, I would 
comply.

As for Conti tires, I can not recommend them.  I am not satisfied at all with their quality.

My wife purchased an Audi Quattro several years ago.  This car had Conti's and whenever 
there was snow on the road, the car would wander all over the road!  Very unstable.  Even 
though the tires only had 10k miles on them, I put a new set of Michelins on it.  The car's 
been wonderful in snow ever since.

I always recommend Michelin, Dunlop and Yokohama tires.  But, I don't know if Dunlop and 
Yokohama make reinforced tires for this market.

&gt; To MD Stocker:
&gt;
&gt;               Given your experience in the tire testing business, what
&gt;would you personally put non-reinforced tires on a Vanagon or EV? I ask
&gt;this because of Ric's new posting and because last year I looked into
&gt;buying a set of Nokian All -weather tires for the EV and decided against
&gt;it because they were NOT reinforced. The dealer's handbook actually listed
&gt;the EV 206/65/15 size but gave a non-reinforced tire for it that could
&gt;take about 1500 lbs for maximum load. But after discussions here and with
&gt;my local mechanic, I decided not to buy them and went back to the replacement
&gt;reinforced Conti's (an average all around tire with a great warranty). So
&gt;any advice you could offer would be interesting.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
