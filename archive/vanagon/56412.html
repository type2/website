Due to the overwhelming response to my post, I find myself in a bit of 
a quandry.  In the interest of fairness, I'm reviewing the e-mails and 
seeing who responded first and will go down the list from there. I will 
be responding to your e-mails directly.   For the price (nil), I hope 
there is the understanding that if someone can come pick it up, it will 
be alot easier all around than my having to ship it via freight.  For 
those not willing to pick it up or set up the freight pickup, I 
apologize but hope for some understanding in that if I wanted to go 
through any kind effort to get rid of this thing I would have asked for 
some bucks!  I also noticed that some of the responders wanted the 
engine for different reasons.  I will try to ensure that whoever gets 
it can pass on any parts they don't need to those that do.(Some wanted 
the case, some wanted the bottom end, etc.)  Cheers!
  
Scott
