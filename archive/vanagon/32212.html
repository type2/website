Subject: For the East coast wanna-Westy

     A few interesting ads in the Washington (DC) Post on Sunday:
     
     84 Westphalia Camper, 4sp, dual AC and heat, 97k, runs and looks good.
     Best offer. (703) 876-6179 (Northern Virginia)
     
     82 Westfalia, diesel camper, new VW eng &amp; trans, exc. Call for info, 
     (304)876-6179 (West Virginia)
     
     The '82 was in the paper about 2 months ago for $6700, if I remember 
     correctly. The guy had the local VW dealer install the new engine and 
     trans. I'm looking for a diesel Westy, but that is a bit steep for me!
     The new diesel engine does little for me, since I hope to get one to 
     re-power with gas.
     
     PS:
     Spelling errors were in the ads-I know how to spell Westyphfalia! ;)
