Subject: Re: any Propex heaters fired up?

Mark said:

&gt;Is anyone other than Tom basking in the warm glow of a new Propex &gt;furnace yet? 

I know that Glen and Caron have theirs up, in a '77,  but they are
probably on the other list. 

&gt;Or are you all waiting for summer like me because you don't have &gt;a garage and it's always dark, raining, or too cold to work &gt;outside. 

It was all those at my place, plus muddy, and still is. I pulled
up next to the house, brought out two 110V lamps and turned on an 1500W
electric heater while I was working. Nice and comfy.

&gt;If you have installed the furnace, how long did it take?

If you are talking a Vanagon Westie, with the benefit of 
my previously posted shoppping lists, numerous mistakes
and cogitations (and if you have as many thumbs as I have) figure a day.
Many people will be able to do it in significantly less, IMHO.

If someone has a professional installation done, I am dying to
hear how long (and how much $) it took.

Later,

Tom F.
