Subject: ca.oct_dot_camp.new.location!(ba)


OK, things are looking up.  It appears that we have regained a lot
of people (and some new signups) if we keep this to one night.  Southern
CA people:  I feel badly about this.  Come join us if you can, and crash
at my place ANY time you like, ok?   ;)

Anyway, I sort of &quot;averaged&quot; the several suggestions which came to
me for location, and tried to keep in mind everything everyone wanted
to do (surfing, bus-part stealing, I mean picking, etc.) and tried to
pick a location given all the above which would please as many
people as possible, as well as offend as few as possible.  

Do you all know where Alice's Restaurant (west coast, I mean) is?  It's
on Highway 84 at the intersection of that highway and Skyline up there
at the top of the hill.  AT least, that's my recollection; perhaps
someone can confirm.  Anyway, this area is damned important historically
with respect to VW and associated history/culture.  Jerry Garcia and
his previous wife (Mt. Girl) used to live up in this area, along
with Ken Kesey.  It is/was a mecca for VW busses, alternative thinking,
counter culture, LSD experimentation, etc.  It's nice, green, forested,
parkish-style.  I suggest we can probably find a nice camping spot
in near by equally historically important La Honda.  I camped there
a few years ago, but not sure I can remember the name of the place.  Anywhere
in there ought to be exquisite.  

Anyway, how would it be if we could all meet, let's say Saturday afternoon
at 2 p.m. at Alice's Restaurant, and go en masse to find a campsite that
suits us from there.  We could then group camp over Saturday night,
and surf/strip-busses Sunday morning and/or afternoon.  How does that
sound?  If someone can't make it by 2 p.m. on this Saturday, we can
leave an informational message for them at the number which has been
previously announced (510.783.1194) to do so.  

So far, here's who wants to come (let me know if I've made any errors):

Bradley Prunehead          bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com                   
Martha Rubin               nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu              
Sam/Susie Williams         Sglw_at_aol_dot_com
Steve Hoge                 steveh_at_emu_dot_com
Larry and Elaina           synchro (friends of Steve Hoge)
Tom Fitzpatrick            tfab_at_netcom_dot_com
?Steve/Linda Johnson       sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com

Things to bring: 

For Sat dinner:
something to BBQ for yourself
something to share in the way of:  salad/veggies/fruit
appetizers/snacks to share with the group

I'll bring or make a dessert, and I'll bring the stuff for Sunday morning
breakfast, which I happen to already have.  Someone ELSE will have to
volunteer to cook it, cuz I don't do mornings (need prep time for
showering, etc.  :)

Other stuff we will desperately need:
firewood
ice
BYO-whatever you like
folding chairs
lunch snacks individual, based on what you want to do on Sunday.

How does this all sound?  That's this Saturday, 2pm at Alice's Restaurant.

Highway 84, btw, runs perpendicularly (sort of) between highways 280
on the east side, and 1 on the west side.  It's about 30 miles south
of Half Moon Bay, but then east (inland) towards Palo Alto, but not that far.

Lemme know, time is drawing nigh.
