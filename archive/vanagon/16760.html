&gt; Someone noted that all (most) VW's which are for sale have recently rebuilt 
&gt; engines in them.  I have been pondering this over the last few weeks.
&gt; A few thoughts:
&gt; 1. the most obvious: They aren't all rebuilt.
&gt; 2. They may be rebuilt, but very few parts replaced.
&gt; 3. maybe rebuilt means the engine has had a valve job recently.

My guess:

  4. They have been rebuilt at some point in their lives.

I'm sure that's true of most air-cooled VW's.  I've seen people advertise
their engines rebuilt, and when I ask how recently, they say, &quot;oh, about
60,000 miles ago&quot; or similar.

&gt; Seriously, how would you tell if the engine had been rebuilt?  If it was 
&gt; very clean, I might believe them, but in the space of two days, I cleaned my 
&gt; engine till you could eat off it.  So who knows.  When I was shopping for my 
&gt; current bus, I found a bus with a &quot;freshly rebuilt engine&quot; in it, the owner 
&gt; told me that it had less than 10k on it. I told him that it was a bald-faced 
&gt; lie, and left.  That engine was absolutly filthy, and hardly looked or 
&gt; sounded rebuilt.

Sounds like it *was* a bald-faced lie.  I usually use the cleanliness to
judge if the engine is rebuilt.  It is easy to clean an engine, true, but
I think rebuilts are cleaned SO WELL that you can tell the difference
between that and someone who gave their engine the once-over with a can
of GUNK.  On an air-cooled VW, I would look for oil leaks.  None would
be a strong reason to believe someone if they say their engine is rebuilt.
Reciepts help too.
