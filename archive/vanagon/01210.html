&gt; well ... there are exceptions to that in other parts of the world. Westfalia
&gt; was NOT the only company doing this. Dehler is one german company that comes
&gt; to mind; Devon is/was a company in Britain; Dormobile also made conversions
&gt; and their pop-tops were hinged on the side (not the front or back). there
&gt; were/are also several other companies in the u.s that made conversions.

 	thanks for the info. Joel.  I wonder if anyone is ever going
to try and document all the varieties made out there. Does anyone
have a Dehler, Devon, or Dormobile ? Confusing, eh ? I was looking
at the '72 and on Haynes Manual ( purple ) and they have a picture
of a camper (I think '73) and it is hinged at the front with the 
luggage rack at front too. I've also seen them hinged at the back
with the luggage rack at front and also every combination in between.
What gives ? Is there any kind of order to how Westfalia  or whoever
did the modifications ? Also, if you got a Campmobile sticker inside
does that necessarily mean that Westfalia did it or could it be
Dehler ?  Also in the Haynes Manual they mention that two models
exist for the '72 thru '79 campers: the Caravette (not Caravelle),
and the Continental. One sleeps four and the other sleeps two. Mine
('72)can sleep at least seven or eight. But mine does not hinge at the
front or back. It pops straight up ! Does anyone else have this ?
I bet you its a Dehler &lt;*: !!
						confused, guntram
