Subject: Re: Whistle sound--Gland nut??

Dave,

I beg to differ on that point...  when you push the clutch in, you take the 
load off of the input shaft of the tranny.  Once the load is off of the tranny 
input shaft, it stops making noise.  On the other hand, if the T/O bearing is 
going out, the noise only occurs when you disengage the clutch (push the clutch 
pedal in).  

I still stand by my original diagnosis of the input shaft carrier bearing being 
worn!!

&gt; I have a new sound I could use some help decoding on my '71.  It's a subtle 
&gt; high pitched (whistle like) sound that doesn't appear to be directly 
&gt; related to wheel speed.  It occurs in all gears (well, I'm sure of 2-4, but 
&gt; the engine revs in 1st might drown it out) but does go away when I press 
&gt; the clutch in at least half way. 

Goes away when you press in the clutch, eh?  Sounds like the throwout
bearing to me.  My Mustang has the same problem.  If so, it should change
a little with engine RPM.
