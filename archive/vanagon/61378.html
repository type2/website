Hey....

I've got that same problem.....does it have to do with the valve that
controls coolant flow to the heat exchanger not closing all the way?  Is
it hard to replace the valve if that is the problem?

&gt;Now that summer's finally arrived, this problem is more noticeable.  Even
&gt;with
&gt;the heater contols all the way on cool (blue), warm/hot air comes in.  Is
&gt;this
&gt;relatively easy to fix?  Will I need to do major dissassembly of the heater
&gt;unit?  Again, any tips or hints are wlecome.  Thanks.
