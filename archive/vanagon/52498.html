     Add the Audi 4000 to the list of possible donor cars that have the 
same heater fan as a Vanagon.  There is a plug instead of spade 
connectors on the motor, and the guy who spent an hour+ pulling it in the 
rain cursed my name, but by the end of today, I'll have a heater again.

      84GL, 85GL + loose engine.
