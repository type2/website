Ive had my 85 vanagon for 2 years and have found it to be very durable so
far. I am concerned by the postesd inticating cooling troubles. I always
thought cooling was this vans strong point-it never gets hot even in 100
degree+ stop and go traffic-it does have a brand new radiador and new
thermostat-my only cooling system trouble is that my van takes a long time to
warm up but once it dose get warmed up I have plenty of heat(love that rear
heater, keeps my little girls nice and warm). What is the main cooling
trouble I should look out for?? peace.
