Subject: Re: WAIT! - was Re: cheap fix

&gt;Dunno, decoding this thing is more dificult than anticipated.  I need an
&gt;EE to volunteer and take a look at what I've discovered to see if it makes
&gt;sense.  I've a 300K postscript file ready to send to such a volunteer ...
&gt;
Send it please, I'll abuse the EE tech shop boys here, no guarantees though. 
I have easy access to 2 EE shops and a PC repair shop in the building, so 
it's worth a try.   tim s.
