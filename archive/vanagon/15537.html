Spotted on the Medical School Campus at Stanford:

For Sale

1987 Vanagon GL Westfalia

**That's all the sign in the window said**

Silver exterior, grey interior
119K miles on the odometer
No obvious exterior damage

-- Just thought you'd like to know.  I have no idea who owns the vehicle and
certainly have no interest in whether it sells or to whom or for how much.
