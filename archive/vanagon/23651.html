&gt;Just talked to a mechanic acquaintence of mine who told me a story about a
&gt;recent deal. He said that he and his venture capitalist partner spotted a
&gt;local ad for a 1992 VW Bus, bad motor, must sell, $900. Call xxx-xxxx. 
&gt;
&gt;'62?  No, '92 no typo.
&gt;
&gt;His pal/business partner immediately screamed over to the proper location
&gt;and negotiated a price of $800. The partner never bothered to ask about what
&gt;the exact trouble was. They anticipated a motor rebuild. What do you want
&gt;for $800!! Both partners came back later to pick it up with Chevy and the
&gt;trailer etc. My friend finally asked what the ailment was. The recently
&gt;previous owner said that &quot;It just wouldn't run!&quot; PEPBOYS supposedly had
&gt;conducted a compression test and diagnosed it as having a hole in #3.
&gt;According to PEPBOYS the engine would cost thousands to rebuild. The couple
&gt;didn't want to pay it. Otherwise the bus was beautiful and low mileaged and
&gt;complete. Perfect. The original owner,(described as the typical fragile
&gt;older church goin' couple) had such bad feelings toward the VW that they
&gt;just didn't want to fool with it any more-wash their hands and walk away-
&gt;didn't want the stress and troubles.
&gt;According to the story, The two stopped to fill the tank of the Chevy
&gt;Suburban for the trek home. While the partner was pumping gas my friend was
&gt;checking out the new acquistion. There was no gas in the tank! Some fuel was
&gt;added and a gentle claw hammer was applied to the frozen fuel pump and it
&gt;kicked right over! Stereo, ice cold A/C, complete with all seats etc.
&gt;According to my friend it ran perfectly after a quick check over.
&gt;Accordingly, the bus provided a quick turn of $7000 profit. The money
&gt;partner felt so bad that he went back to the original seller and gave them
&gt;more money to clear his conscience. Hmmm... 
&gt;
&gt;
Yeeaaah, Riiiight!
Like there even were '92 VW vans in the U.S.A.
Some people will believe anything!
