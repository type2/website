Subject: East Coast Gathering???

I'd very much like to join, but timing is of importance to us --
between my schedule, my wife's schedule, and the two kids' schedules...

We will probably not make it the whole trip, but, if a leg of it passes
anywhere in NNY, NJ or PA, We'll catch the group, stick around for the
weekend...
