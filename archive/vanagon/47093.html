Subject:  Coolant Indicator LED is Flashing at Normal Temperatures

CONDITION
Coolant overheat / low coolant level indicator LED is flashing at
normal coolant temperatures.
SERVICE
Check the coolant indicator LED according to the list below.
The following applies IN ADDITION to tests listed in the Service
Microfiche.          .

* refer to appropriate wiring diagram
* disconnect coolant level sensor electrical connector
* check coolant level in coolant reservoir
   *** MUST be between MIN and MAX marks
* set digital multimeter, Fluke 83 (US 1119) to ohms function
* check resistance of level sensor with digital multimeter Fluke 83
  (US 1119)
  *** must be between 31K Ohm and 65K Ohm with correct COOLANT LEVEL
      AND COOLANT CONCENTRATION.

NOTE
If coolant resistance is NOT within the above specifications, the
coolant MUST be drained and replaced with NEW coolant mixture of
50 percent water and 50 percent phosphate free coolant antifreeze,
Part No. ZVW 237 104.  (In Canada, use Part No. G 001 100).  The
mixing should be performed before filling vehicle cooling system.

*****************************************************************
* CAUTION                                                       *
* Coolant concentrations of 60 percent or higher will cause the *
* overtemp / low coolant LED to activate.                       *
****************************************************************

*****************************************************************
* CAUTION                                                       *
* Coolant antifreeze MUST NOT be reused.  Properly dispose of   *
* used coolant.                                                 *
****************************************************************

* reconnect sensor connector
* check coolant level control unit using wiring diagram

NOTE
The control unit is located on top of the fuse/relay panel on vehicles
up to 1989 model year and thereafter it is integrated into the multi-
processor of the instrument cluster circuit board.

* if wiring, coolant level sensor and coolant concentration are OK,
  replace coolant level control unit or instrument cluster circuit
  board
* refer to appropriate Service Microfiche Group 90 - Coolant
  Temperature Gauge, checking and troubleshooting
* confirm proper operation of temperature gauge and blinking LED per
  Service Microfiche Group 90

*****************************************************************
* CAUTION                                                       *
* Part Numbers are for reference only.  Always check with your  *
* Parts Department for latest parts information.                *
