Steve... and anyone else into this topic.   The oil is going to seep out
the seam between the two panels.  The chanel is about 1/2&quot; deep ??, I
didn't measure it when I was in there (:-).   A good rust inhibitor would
probably work as well,  it needs to be a substance that will &quot;travel&quot; by
capillairy action unless you want to take all your cabinets out and get
full access to the the seam, then you could rustproof it properly.  The
problem stems from Volkswagen and probably  all other car companies
welding together panels then not treating the bare metal joint from BOTH
sides.  They figure that some seam sealer and paint from the outside to look
&quot;pretty&quot; in the showroom is fine !   WRONG !

Cheers

Frank
