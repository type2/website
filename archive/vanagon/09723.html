Derek,

&lt;deleted some lines&gt;

&gt; I had in mind adding some more notches in the metal there near the pivot so
&gt; that the seat could have more notches to go back in to but I haven't
&gt; dismantled things sufficiently to see if such a plan will work.

Sounds like a good idea, but I have a problem with the seat reclining
on my 86 non-Westy. When the seat is at the rear of its track, it
can't recline to its max because it hits the black seat belt inertia
mechanism.

Do your seats avoid this?
