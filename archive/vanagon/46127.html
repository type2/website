Subject: RE: '66 Carcass FS, more info

I just remembered one very important detail that will probably nix this bus for
most of you.  It has the 1/3, 2/3 bench seats in the front, but some PO has cut
out the bulkhead between the front and back.  The PO didn't butcher anything
else, so all that needs to be replaced is the bulkhead itself.

To clarify, this is a '66 standard micro with 3 windows on each side of the
rear, with no interior whatsoever, but no cancer.  (the price is probably
negotiable).

peace,
terry
