&gt;&gt;The engine has a case number of B5XXXXXXXX  Can anyone identify that for

&gt;
&gt;My '69 bus had one of these when I first bought it many years ago. It
&gt;had been bored out for large cylinders by the PO, which I quickly found
&gt;out was a big mistake. These B blocks are original German, I believe,
&gt;but they are made of an alloy which was slightly more brittle than later
&gt;blocks (AE, AF etc.). So when you bore them out, they crack very easily,
&gt;and can ruin your whole day. Mine got to the point where it vibrated so
&gt;badly it kept breaking throttle springs (?), and blew out all of its oil
&gt;in less than 30 seconds through an ever-lengthening crack from the oil
&gt;cooler mount to the cam gear bearing mount. It also eventually shot the
&gt;#3 spark plug all the way across the engine compartment, but I think that
&gt;was a seperate problem.

Hmm, I do not think it has been modified, just rebuilt.  My concern was
that it was not a '68-'69 longblock which was one of the reasons I was
considering it.  I would rather buy a used engine I know runs then one from
a junkyard which I am taking even MORE chances on.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The lid did say it had been rebuilt
&gt;&gt;13k ago but it sounded kinda rough.  It kept dying at first and then he got
&gt;&gt;it to idle but I was a bit uneasy about it.
&gt;
&gt;Could be carburetor, could be valves, could be a vacuum leak (which won't
&gt;do the valves any good)... can you do a compression check on it? Also, try
&gt;spraying WD-40 on the carb, manifold joints, etc. If the engine changes
&gt;speed when you do this, you've just found a vacuum leak. Typical locations
&gt;are the throttle plate bearings, the gasket the carb sits on, and the places
&gt;where the manifold bolts to the cylinder heads.

Well, it did say a valve adjustment had been done 8k ago.  I admit it has
been quite a few years since I have heard a VW engine in tune and correct
so it just may be my out of shape ears.  I will look at the engine again.
It did say it had an oil leak from the head gaskets.

&gt;
&gt;Something Bob Hoover once pointed out to me, is the round plug in the throat
&gt;of the carb. It's about the size and shape of a dime, or a titch smaller,
&gt;and
&gt;is pressed into the carb just above the gasket it sits on. If you open the
&gt;rear hatch and look at the bottom of the carb, you're looking right at it.
&gt;A hefty backfire can blow this plug out, and then you'll be lucky if the
&gt;engine runs at all.
&gt;

I will look at this as well.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The electrical seemed good and the clutch/tranny were fine.  The steering
&gt;&gt;was way rough.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The cargo section under the rubber was major rusty.  It looks like it was a
&gt;&gt;delux with all the chrome trim but....
&gt;
&gt;How major is major? rusted thru in large areas? If not, I'd be inclined to
&gt;go for it.
&gt;

Well, admitedly it was dark and even though I had a flashlight I could have
just seen dirt build up.

&gt;If worse comes to worst, you can put a good used dual-port engine in it,
&gt;with
&gt;doghouse cooler, for around $400 and an afternoon's work. Or you can get
&gt;a rebuilt long block for around $650 (good one) or $350 (caveat emptor),
&gt;and rebuild the carb if it needs it.
&gt;
&gt;If the bus has a floor, pour some motor oil on it, wipe up the excess, put
&gt;the rubber mat back down, put some plastic drop cloth over it, some carpet
&gt;from the local carpet shop, and hold it down by bolting the seats and belts
&gt;over it.

This is logical and it seems to have a good floor which is either major
dirty or major surface rust (paint bubbling)

&gt;
&gt;BTW, is there any rust right below the windshield? This is chronic in
&gt;Baywindow buses, and can be a b*tch to fix, since the metal carries the
&gt;windshield wipers and can be heavily stressed at times.

Yes, it is there.  And I *KNOW* what you mean.  The Westy I have is VERY
rusted there.  The '68 I am looking at is not so rusted outside under the
window as the '69 I have so this may be a good thing.

&gt;
&gt;If the floor's gone, though... Hmmm. Either become real good friends with
&gt;a skilled welder, or save your money for a more rust-free one.

Well, as I said to the owner, unless something major happens I am getting
it.  From the responses I am getting I am even more inclined to get it.
Hopefully, the steering problem was mostly due in part to the tire.
Otherwise a 90 mile tow is NOT in the budget!

Thanks again and Hopefully Joel will have to update the stats for me!

BTW, where does one get these list stickers I keep hearing about?
