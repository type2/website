&gt; i recently got a copy of a Bosch catalog of gasoline and diesel injection
&gt; products. and, as i am wont to do at times, have started typing it in. :)
&gt; 
&gt; i've sent out the diesel and the eurovan stuff (cause it is smaller and
&gt; was easy to put in). i'm working on the 1991-1986 vanagons, 1985-1983
&gt; water-cooled vanagons, 1983-1980 air-cooled vanagons, and the 1979-1974
&gt; buses.  well, that's what it says anyway. i never heard of a 74 bus with
&gt; fuel injection, much less a 2.0 liter engine, but that's what the catalog
&gt; says.  ??

Hmm... I can't speak for the 2.0 liter engine part, but I ran into a
guy that had a `74 bus that had fuel injection.  I can't speak for
whether he knew what he was talking about thinking that his was a `74
or not, but for a long time I thought fuel injection was implemented
mid-year in `74 (since my `74 doesn't have it).  He did have a 1.8
liter engine, though.  Could it be that he had a `75 and didn't know
it?  I'm pretty sure it was stock, BTW.

Just another data point for the detail-curious amongst us...
