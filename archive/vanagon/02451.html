Take this piece of free advice from one who, in a &quot;past life&quot; could have
cost you both money and driving points.

Many cars are equipped with devices that can detect and track speed
IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.

In addition, if it is possible to determine your speed, reasonably
(normally the judge determines reasonableness), even without a device, you
can be cited and convicted ... regardless of your position with respect
to the police car.
