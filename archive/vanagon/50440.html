Subject: Re: Replacement Struts for Rear Hatch on Vanagon

&gt; Does anyone know where to get replacement struts for the rear hatch of a
&gt; 1991 Vanagon.  Mine have finally given out completely.  (Boy is that rear
&gt; door heavy without them!)
&gt; 
&gt; I priced them at the dealer today and they want $55.80 plus tax for each of
&gt; them!!  And of course they have to be special ordered!
&gt; 
&gt; I was able to get the part number from the dealer:  251829-331B or
&gt; 251829-332.  
&gt; 
&gt; There must be a mail order company somewhere that offers a better deal.  
&gt; 
I got mine (for an '86) from JCWhitney, I think they were about $25 ea.  VW
seems to have used different ones over the years, though.  I think the later
ones were &quot;weaker&quot; so that you could close the hatch easier.   I like the
early ones better, where the hatch opens easy.
