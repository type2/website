&gt;I don't know if polishing compound will take care of the groove in my
&gt;windshield but I'm going to give it a try.  I guess that means I have
&gt;a groovy windshield! :}

you might try talking to one of these rock-chip-fixit-places. i seem to
recall something about them being able to polish out small stuff ... if
your scratch qualifies as 'small'.

&gt;Also on the subject of windshields, what can I do to eliminate/minimize
&gt;fogged windows?  Does Rain-X work inside as well?  Do those anti-fog
&gt;cloths really work?  Anyone?

well, from personal experience, DO NOT use Rain-X inside! it makes all sorts
of wierd rainbo defraction patterns (or whatever the hell those things are)
... and i don't smoke anything. ;)  there is supposedly some stuff made
specially for the inside, but i've never tried it after my bad experience.
by the way, if you decide to try it anyway, it's a bitch to get off. :)
