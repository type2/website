Subject: stumbling 89 GL 2.1 Westy

Hooray!   It's fixed... after all my efforts, and time, and $$$$ (cheapest
stuff first), it tuned out to be a bad spark-plug wire.  This seemed strange
to me, since my problems occured after warm-up, and didn't idle badly.   Out
of desperation, I measured ohms in all ig coil, and plug wires... One seemed
too low.... and that was it!    Runs like a top now.... All you listvolks out
there with similiar symptoms... check plug wires!  Symptoms were... starts
great at cold.... within minutes of warm-up,  it starts to stumble, and
shutter through RPM range from a dead stop, or slow-down until I reached
about 3K rmp,  and then just fine...  Also,  if I turned on the A/C , or
added any load,  it occured.  Turn her off,  fire her right back up, and the
same problems.... Not the air meter,  not the O2 sens, temp II sensor, idle
stab, or control unit......By the way,, if you have any similiar type
difficulty, and are still running old grey label ignition coil,  check ohm
meter contacts, as this occured last year.. Upgrade to green label unit...
Hope I've helped you a litte... Maybe my wife will let me back in now.......
Thanks for all the help, and suggestions...
