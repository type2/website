Subject:  help!  turn signal mystery

OK, here's the (new!) problem:

Background:
Last night, I was pressurizing my windshield washer when I noticed that
a rather large puddle was forming under the steering wheel.  The hose
that goes to the valve on the washer switch is apparently leaking and
has got all kinds of things wet up there.  Tried to get to the hose but was
unsuccessful.  It's not leaking anymore as I've bled all the air out but I
couldn't figure out how to get to the hose.

Problem:
Today I went to have my wheels aligned.  Driving to the shop, turn
signals worked fine.  Coming back they worked fine for a while.  Then, at
a stoplight, while none of the turn signals were on, I heard this strange
noise.  Couldn't figure out what it was.  Sounded like a high-pitched
buzzing with some clicking thrown in.  Pulled over to look and determined
that the sound was coming from the turn signal/flasher relay.  During this
episode, the turn signals became nonfunctional.  When the switch was
turned on, the indicator light lit and stayed steadily lit while none of the
outside lights came on.  

Pulled the relay and went to buy another one.  Bought another one.  Put it
in, turned on the hazard switch and POP the fuse blew.  Instantly. 
Substitued a 16-amp fuse and it worked for about two seconds before
th fuse blew.  Took it back (assuming defective relay) and got another
one.  Same thing happened.  Even with another brand relay.  So around
this time I figured something different was going on.  

So I put the new relay in, turned the key on, and turned the left turn
signals on.  They worked.  Then I turned the right ones on.  They didn't
work (same symptoms as above).  After that, the left ones didn't work
either.  When you turn on the signal, the indicator light stays on and the
relay buzzes.  

So what is going on?  Could I possibly have a short?  How long does it
take windshield washer fluid that's trapped in the steering column to dry
up?

AAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!

All help will be appreciated,
Sean
