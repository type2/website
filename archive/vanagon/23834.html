Subject: Re[2]: 6v fuel gauge in 12v bu

     &gt;In such a setup the gauge measures the current in the circuit through 
     &gt;the variable resistor in the gas tank.  Given that (for all practical 
     &gt;purposes) the voltage from the battery is constant, the current in 
     &gt;the circuit varies with the resistance in the sender ( in accordance 
     &gt;with Ohm's law,  Volts = amps times ohms).  This varying current is 
     &gt;reflected in the deflection of the gauge.
     
     yep
     
     &gt;Therefore if the gauge and variable resistor remain original 
     &gt;equipment (6 volt) and you double the battery voltage from 6 to 12 
     &gt;volts, the current in the circuit will be 2X the current that you 
     &gt;would have with a 6 volt battery under the same circumstances (fuel 
     &gt;level) .
     
     yep
     
     &gt;The fact that your particular set up works does not mean that the 
     &gt;above is invalid.  Do you know for sure that your sender and gauge 
     &gt;are the original 6 volt units and not replaced with 12 volt units by 
     &gt;a PO because 6 volt replacements were not available?  Maybe he lived 
     &gt;with a gas gauge that read LOW by half!
     
     I asked this question long ago. I carried out exactly the same 
     analysis of the circuit, concluding that the meter should read twice 
     as much. I know that I have the original 6v gauge and sender setup in 
     my bus and it reads just fine from 12V.
     
     I know that the tank is actually full because I can see the pertrol in 
     the neck and the amount of fuel I put in corresponds with other 
     peoples vans that are genuine 12V buses with 12V gauges and senders.
     
     I know this hasn't got us anywhere, but I wouldn't go paying big bucks 
     for a 12v guage and sender. If you're are really bothered, simply run 
     the gauge system off a 6v voltage converter circuit.
