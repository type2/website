&gt;&gt; buses.  well, that's what it says anyway. i never heard of a 74 bus with
&gt;&gt; fuel injection, much less a 2.0 liter engine, but that's what the catalog
&gt;
&gt;or not, but for a long time I thought fuel injection was implemented
&gt;mid-year in `74 (since my `74 doesn't have it).  He did have a 1.8
&gt;liter engine, though.  Could it be that he had a `75 and didn't know

i guess so. all my previous info said that the 74 was carbs and the 75 was
fuel injected and BOTH had an 1800cc engine. but the bosch book says 74 had
fuel injection and a 1970cc engine. :)  since it seems they listed ALL of
the 1979-1974 buses as having that same size engine, i guess it's just a
screw-up in their catalog. :)
