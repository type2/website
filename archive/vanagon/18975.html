Subject: '67 Bus for sale. 21 window.

I was cruizing the boneyards of central PA this weekend.

First, a referrel for wannabusses of the splittie nature:
My mechanic up there has a customer that wants to sell his
'67 21 window bus. From what I could see, it looked
mostly solid. There was a hole in the cargo bay floor and
a wooden floor was installed. Some camping cabinets were also installed.
No Middle seats, but all the existing upolstery was in good shape.
No missing, bastardized parts. No cutting done. Drivetrain looked
solid, and suspensions were rust free. All glass and rubber
looked leakfree. He said that the owner would prob take the
first $1000 waved under his nose. Cash is hard to come by up there.
Has a 'tired' 1600cc dual port in it now. The mechanic will prob.
fill your cargo bay with old engines for free if you take it.
He also has a few other rusting out splitties out back. And scads
of bugs.

His name is Adrian, at A+P Foreign, and his number is 412-754-8403. Tell 
him Chris sent you. If you are in the area, I reccomend him.

Next, a rave about crushers.
I almost decked a guy at one yard that also told me that
Bugs usually go onto the crusher first, because they 'have no value,
except to broke hippies and rich rebuilders'. He would not think
of selling the three split busses in back becasue he needed them as
storage!. He would have to crush about 6 bugs to get the same tonnage
in scrap as any one of the Caprice Classic wagons he had laying around.
One Splittie has the most beautiful home-done camping package in it.
All mahogony and brass. Looked like a sailing yacht! If I had a splittie,
I would of bought if on the spot. Full length cabinets down one side
and deep varnish finish. Good thing the glass is still there. I could 
get his phone number if anybody wants it, but I dont have it handy.

Lesson learned: Bugs are about as rare as hens teeth in central PA!
