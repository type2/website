&gt; So, for the question -- has anyone else had experience removing a 
&gt; flywheel attached with the 5 hex head bolts and if you did, how did you
&gt; get it off, and after you got the 5 bolts off, did the flywheel come 
&gt; right off, or did you have to force it off with the large bolt or what?

Yup.  You know the bolts that hold the pressure plate on?  Put two of them
back in (across the flywheel from each other) and then get a long bar and
put it flat against the flywheel between the bolts, and turn the fly-
wheel counterclockwise until the bolts hit the bar and the bar hits the
ground or some other immovable object.  Then put the biggest wrench 
you have on the flywheel bolts and tweak those muthas off.  Oh, if the
bar you are using turns out to be too big, you may need to use longer
bolts than the ones that held the pressure plate on, and you may have to
use the holes at 12 and 4 o'clock instead of opposite ones if the bar
blocks access to the flywheel bolts.  I have always been able to make this
work in one form or another, though.
