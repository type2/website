Subject: Antenna Replacement

One of the few flaws on my lovely new (87) Syncro is a snapped off radio
antenna. I've purchased a replacement but - much to my chagrin- I don't
seem to find any reference to replacing said item in the Bentley manual.

Attempting to wing it has proven rather daunting, and I stopped before I
made a big mess of things. Please, somebody tell me that I don't have to
remove the entire dash assembly to do this.

Paul
