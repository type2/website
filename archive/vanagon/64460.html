I've used 87 oct some in my VR6 EV, and it runs fine - but seems to get lower
mileage. This should be expected, since the knock sensor will retard the
timing to keep from knocking. As long as the sensor works it should run
without problems; but a bit less power and mileage.

&gt;Anyone tried using 87 grade gas with the VR6 engine?  I hate to use the 91
&gt;gas if I don't need it.
