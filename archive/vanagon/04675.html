Joel asked:
&gt;BUT! if you have one in the bus, where did you put it (phsyically)?
where's &gt;the antenna? etc. which kind? (fixed mount, portable, Nokia,
Wal-Mart, etc.?)

Sorry, mine, too, is a small hand-held one,  so it's not attached to
anything. It's got the extension cord to the cigarette lighter and both
(the cigarette lighter and the phone) are hidden in the glove compartment
(pssst, don't tell anyone, it's a secret...). The connection to the
cigarette lighter insures that the battery remains charged for longer trips.

The phone is turned off most of the time and is really just some sort of
insurance. We also take it on hiking trips. But when playtime is over,
which is most of the time, my wife keeps it in her car. She works in
downtown St.Louis and feels safer with that thing. 

Now, to answer your question, if I wanted to install a permanent one in
the bus, I would probably build some sort of center console replacing the
jump seat between the 2 front seats. And then you can add two more
cigarette lighters and the CD player, slots for small change, cupholders,
armrests, additional gauges, lots of buttons and switches, a computer, and
maybe a replicator? :) --

Make it so.
