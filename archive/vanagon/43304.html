&gt; The longest journey in VW Camper was made by Harry B. Coleman and Peggy
&gt;Larson.  They completed 143,716 miles from August 20, 1976 to April 20, 1978
&gt; thrthrough 113 countries.

aha!!! not so fast, Travel-breath!!! ;)

i've got a book, Im VW-Bus um die Erde, by Wil and Sigrid Tondok, which
claims 350,000 km in a (highly customized) 1968-1971 VW high-roof camper,
from 1971 to 1979 (? i can't read enough german to tell for sure).
that's about 217,000 miles. don't know how many countries .... but they
hit five continents: europe to africa, down to the &quot;indentation&quot; of africa,
back up to the mediterranean, across to egypt, back to europe, down through
the balkans to pakistan/india, down to singapore, perth (australia), across
to sydney, up to darwin, by boat to new zealand, boat again to columbia (?),
down the coast to chile, over to argentina, up to brazil, west to bolivia,
up to panama, mexico, u.s.a., canada, east to newfoundland, and by boat
back to europe.

from what i can gather, at the end of the journey, they donated the bus to
the Deutsches Museum.

then,in the back of the book, he shows pictures of getting ready to travel
again ... in what looks like a high-roof diesel vanagon. with slide-out
&quot;room&quot; on the drivers side. :)

... so, does all that boating count?? :)
