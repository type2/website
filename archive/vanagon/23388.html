Subject: Re: winches 

&gt;So Tim Smith says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The high lift jack is cheap and reliable and doesn't require 80-200 amps to 
&gt;&gt; work. Winch electrical hookup was enough to put me off the idea. 2nd 
&gt;&gt; battery, heavy wire everywhere, maybe a heavier alternator... Winching 
&gt;&gt; yourself out will drain a battery in short order. No fun if you can't start 
&gt;&gt; your van once you get back on solid ground. If you just want to get off 
&gt;&gt; slippery surfaces then a cheap block and tackle set, 1000lbs, 6 foot pull 
&gt;&gt; may suit. Packs away tightly also.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;For those of us not so well informed of the nominclature you're using, could
&gt;you please explain what entails a block and tackle set.  Are you talking
&gt;about a come-along (hand winch) with some rope and hooks?
&gt;

I've been carrying a hand winch for awhile.  It has about 16' of 5/16&quot; cable
on a drum with a ratcheting handle.  Very common and I've seen really cheap
ones for $12, better ones run about $35-50.  Of course 5/16&quot; cable isn't
good for too much, maybe 1500 lbs using the block.  If you're trying to pull
your 5000 lb. bus back onto the road from 6' down an embankment or
something, there would need to be some serious hardware available, like
1/2&quot;-5/8&quot; cable and a 2-ton chain motor.  Or, hey, how about a 4000 lb.
winch?  Maybe drive more carefully on that Ramshorn summit road?
