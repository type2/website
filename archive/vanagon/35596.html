Subject: Bug Freeeeeze swap meet - UK

     Hi all,
     
     Well it was the first major event of the year here in the UK on 
     Sunday. As usual I hardly saw anyone, because it was hectic.
     
     There was a far amount of early bus stuff at the meet, including 
     Karmann Konnections new Barndoor panel van, I just had to point out 
     the fact that they had the wrong bumper on the front, Julian responded 
     by pointing to the NOS rear body deluxe trims they had fitted!
     
     I spent loads of money and came away with a few bargains:
     
     o   set of genuine US spec. cibie bus headlamps - complete
     o   bag of 50 cab door/rear hatch s/steel panel clips
     o   a couple of spare NOS wiper blades
     o   a new, repro chrome front emblem (for my pickup)
     o   a spare NOS 12V regulator
     o   a little model single cab ;)
     o   an EMPI license plate surround (none original)
     o   a bag of assorted s/steel self tapping screws - cool
     o   a bag of 1000! zip ties
     o   8mb of 72-pin RAM (?!! at a VW meet!)
     
     cool!
     
     I have booked my bus into the Volksworld show at Sandown Park next 
     month, but I'm waiting for conformation - gotta get my CAL plates 
     sorted now.
     
     I also heard a rumour that Beetle Bash will be huge i.e. Glastonbury 
     substitute and the tickets are gonna be extortionate like 45 quid a 
     go!!
     
     I'll ring them and find out about it.
     
     Lee.
