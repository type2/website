	Angel,
	I'd been thinking about the prevalence of English on the 'net
only this morning, and I was pleased to see your original post in Spanish.
My Spanish isn't very good (just about non-existant) and I'd probably
get a Spanish/English dictionary to sit by the computer of more of
this list were in Spanish. I presume notes to the list are fair
game for amateur language students to practice on.

	As far as I'm concerned, discussions of VW busses are the point
here, and that neccessarily includes non-English writers. And is a good
thing for all of us!

	De nada! ?Porque no?
