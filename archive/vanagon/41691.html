Subject: Norseman Awnings Info

        Well since Im up here in chilly Edmonton, Id thought Id at least
check out some of the info on the awning situation. I called Norseman, who
have now become Northwest Tent and Awning. They told me they do not sell
direct anymore. You now have to get there products through local RV and
camper dealerships. So local dealerships like Hunters RV, and Camper's
Village here in Edmonton do still sell their awnings, but unfortunately
since Im at work I cant go calling around. Maybe Ill try tonight and see if
I can get some prices if anyones still interested.

party till you puke
