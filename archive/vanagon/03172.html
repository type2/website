Running two tires of different diameter may have been a cause in the
early demise of the previous engine, though i have no idea how long
they were like that...they are radials all around and soon as winter
comes I am going to put decent reinforced 185 tires up front; You areee
right about handling, reinforced tires improve handling immensely
especially in cross winds. BTW I have heard that the newer of the
tires should go up front...any ideas? DC
