Answer to question 1.
Always buy parts that are designed for the year and model vehicle that 
you are putting them in. This is espicially true for aftermarket parts, 
but holds true for OEM parts as well. There are some parts for 
different year vehicles that will work but unless your parts dealer is 
well versed in which parts fall into this category play it safe and buy 
parts for the vehicle make and model year.

HAve a great day,
