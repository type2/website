Subject:      Re: Headlight covers, square headlamp Vanagon's

&gt; Does anyone have knowledge as to where I could purchase a set of wire or
&gt; Lexan headlight covers for the square headlamps on an '87 Vanagon?  I
&gt; have replaced two this year due to rock damage at a cost of $111.00
&gt; each. Any possible resources would be helpful.

Yes, I have Vanagon headlight covers for $39.95/pair.  Made from plexiglass
or something similar.
