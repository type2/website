Subject: Re: Blinker Relay

Thanks everyone for the information on the blinker relay, i opened the bulb
housing and cleaned connections and everything is back to normal.  That is,
like it was before, the remaining problem is my rear parking light is always
off but if i walk back there and give the thing a smack, it will turn on.
It is a bad connection, i tried using steel wool, baking soda, and silicon
spray (advice from someone) but it is still agonizing my life.  Any tricks
to fixing this??  Thanks again.
