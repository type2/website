Subject:       please change my status!! 

I'm a proud papa for the second time this year. Molly was born April 
10, 1995 at 11:18 AM _at_ 8#-6oz. With my wifes blessing, last night I 
purchased a 71 westfalia camper with a hard top.  Mechanically it is 
a project bus.  That is needs a rebuild. I plan on goin through all 
the mechanics. Probably bit off more than i can chew, but since i am 
spending a lot of time at home lately, with molly that is, and the 
price was right $50.00, i figured what the heck.  Interior is 
complete, clean and in good shape, four decent tires, all 
the windos work great, even a hammock and screen. Rust....well, i'd 
have to say on the low side for the rust belt. The sliding door works 
great, i mean perfect. Talked owner down from $400 to $50. Never did 
that before.  Looking forward to a long relationship with the list on 
the road to recovery.  

Thanks in advance.
