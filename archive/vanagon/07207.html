Subject:      early vanagon door locks, passenger side

i've probably said something about this before, but what the heck ...

all of you with early vanagons (up to 1982, i think) who can NOT lock their
passenger door from outside ... you can replace that part of the door
locking mechanism (the big brass part you can see when you open the door)
with a later model mechanism (251-837-016A). this will allow you to push
the door lock button down, and push the door closed, locking it from the
outside.

i don't remember when it was changed, but i did it on my old 80 bus ... i
think it took all of about 15 minutes to change it out. in 1982, the part
cost $25.52 US ... i have no idea what it would cost now. but you should
be able to get any later model mechanism from a junk yard ... this part
has nothing to do with the key cylinders (so swapping it does NOT require
any rekeying).

why swap? well, cause if the button is pushed down (on the original lock),
pulling on the interior door handle will still open the door! this was
graphically demonstrated to me by a 4-year old while riding down the highway.
not a good idea. with the newer mechanism, this can't happen.

well, ok. so the little bugger can reach around and pull up the lock button
... but that gives you time to pop him one with your backhand. :)

anyway, it's a thought.
