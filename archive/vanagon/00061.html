My wife does this every time the time changes (the Vanagon is hers).
I usually can unstick the clock by using a very narrow, sharp
inplement, like a thin straight pin.  The setting buttons have
a slightly concave surface, and you can &quot;catch&quot; the button and
move it over with the pin.  A bright light helps too.
