&gt;     Congrats on your find.   In May, I traveled all the way to GA/SC to

&gt;     Actually, if it isn't required to wave, it should be!  Having driven a 
&gt;     &quot;splittie&quot; for 10 years, I got used to waving and/or flashing the 
&gt;     headlights at every other &quot;splittie&quot; I saw; often, the other driver 
&gt;     would beat me to it.
&gt;     
&gt;     Years ago, I had a '71 Westfalia - same phenomenon.
&gt;     
&gt;     There's a tendency for Westfalia owners, no matter what the vintage of 
&gt;     their vehicle, to flash and/or wave at one another.
&gt;     
&gt;     Keep doing it.  It's the &quot;secret handshake&quot; of our ken.
&gt;     
&gt;     BTW, do Acura owners flash and wave at each other?  I rest my case.

In all the years since I got the Acura, not a single other Acura owner has
waved at me! I like Hondas and  Acuras because for ordinary cars, they 
are fun to drive. But the Westy is like a whole different universe!  The 
first 
weekend I drove it, the driver of another Westy of nobler vintage rolled
down his window and yelled &quot;nice bus!&quot; to me. I rolled mine down and 
yelled 
back &quot;yours too!&quot;
