Martin,

I'm pretty sure the puller is required for pre-68 buses but not for our
year. Maybe it is &quot;required,&quot; come to think of it...I did have a time
removing the wheel from the hub, but what I did was use a couple of long
2x4's bolted together to get leverage to pull the wheel off. I seem to
recall having to get something into the center of the hub (maybe a cut
washer or a bolt of just the right length laid sideways)...anyway,
something to pull the wheel off as it was attached to the bus still. I
attached a wire/cable/rope to the 2x4s, pulled tight and at an angle, and
started hammering on the 2x4s to pull the hub off. (Look at the setup and
if all this doesn't make sense, let me know, I'll try to
remember/reconstruct what I did). 

As I recall, the bearings will be inside the hub once you remove the wheel
(removing the big 422mm...or 47mm or whatever nut). You'll need to remove
rather stubborn circlips to get to either wheel bearing. From there, you
can use a long, thin punch to remove the outer bearing first.  There's a
spacer between the bearings that's prone to get in the way, but you can
slide it to one side as long as your punch is narrow enough.  Actually, it
may be a good idea to remove the center part of the outer bearing and the
rollers first, before using the punch. Once you remove the outer bearing 
and the spacer, you can punch out the inner bearing. 

This punching job is tricky. To do it right, you need to position the 
punch on the hard part of the bearing wall, but not resting against the 
inside of the hub...the point is, don't scratch up the inside of your hub 
punching out a bearing. The other part to the trick is to rotate the 
punch arond the bearing as you tap it out. This is particularly tricky 
with the outer bearing since the spacer will be in the way some.

When I did this I tore up the outer bearing because I didn't tap round and
around and far enough toward the outside of the bearing wall. It was an 
ignorant mistake, but one I learned from. 

Now, all this said, I'm not so sure that you &gt;have&lt; to remove the bearings
to repack them. I know I did, but I wanted to inspect them too, which you
probably &gt;&gt;should&lt;&lt; do. I guess you have to remove them to do it &gt;right&lt;,
but in a pinch, you might be able to pack some grease in there without
actually removing the bearings. 

Four things to watch out for:

1. Dirt or sand. Don't get any in there.

2. Use the same kind of grease unless you remove, clean, and repack. 
   Regular, old timey axle grease and newer white grease aren't supposed to
   be compatible. 

3. Remember to reinstall the spacer as it came out.

4. Dirt or sand. They are not your friends.

If you do remove the bearings, you can clean them with solvent. I used 
gas, but you might want to use kerosene or diesel or paint thinner. Don't 
know which is best, but I'm sure there are varying opinions anyway.

If you're using an old copy of Muir, the pages around that section are a 
little confusing. For a while, I was looking at the axle for splits, 
thinking it was mine. Nothing like trying to follow the wrong directions 
for creating a state of confusion. Of course, I've learned a little since 
then, so it might have just been ignorance shining through.

Good luck! Joe
