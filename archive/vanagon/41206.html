Subject: Halon fire extinguishers

A few threads recently have stated that halon fire extinguishers are
no longer available.  I recently received a catalog from Pegasus racing
supplies (sent to me because I ordered something from Classic Motorbooks
which has made some good $ selling my name and address since then--if
only Pegasus racing supplies knew the book I bought was a split window
bus manual :-)  ), which has halon extinguishers listed in it.

A small hand held one is ~$100 (part #2081), systems to install
in the car run from $300+ and up.  Refills on these run
from $200-400.  Ouch!  They'll ship UPS with an added &quot;hazardous
materials&quot; fee.

It's a pretty fun catalog, makes you realize that racing is a very
very very expensive sport.

There actually is some VW stuff in it:  a complete Formula V engine
from Vee Tech is $4800.  Wow.

They also have little labels and special
paints that change colors when heated, so you can check engine temps
at different spots.

Their # is 1-800-688-6946.
