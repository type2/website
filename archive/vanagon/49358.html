Helmut Zeidler in Dusseldorf has very helpfully annotated the
Audi 5-cylinder price list that I posted this morning.  His
comments are in parens, mine [regarding the Audi, and similar
Porsche-retrofit problems] in square brackets.
 
Basic building set:
 
1 bellhousing for the bus transmission  (about 150 $ in South
Africa)
 
1 special flywheel (240mm -- AUDI flywheel have 228mm, same as
my 2.0L Camper)
 
1 crankshaft adapter with bearing  (easily to machine it + VW
bearing)
 
1 engine carrier with welded parts [clarifying that the engine
carrier is finished as provided by Winkler.] 
 
1 exhaust system with manifold connection   (without cat
converter) [a big deal in Germany for reasons that aren't
completely clear to me; apparently cars after a certain model
year now need catalysts even if they weren't born with them?]
 
1 set of gaskets for bellhousing  (only one, between bellhousing
and gearbox)
 
1 holder for clutch cylinder  (that's the old one, remade to fit
the bellhousing)
 
30 page instruction manual   (only 10 pages useful, you have it
already [as HZ has translated it for the list in past weeks]
without the drawings, other pages are copies from AUDI 5000
DIY's)
 
Price DM2,750
 
 
 
bellhousing, only as replacement part in exchange    1100 (Part
number BCY 301107A, app. 150 $ in South Africa)
 
flywheel, only as replacement part in exchange        750 (take
the AUDI one and machine it to 240mm)
 
engine carrier complete                               480 (the
most important thing) [HZ implies that this one piece is what
one really needs to buy from Winkler to complete the Audi 5
installation.  The reasons the Porsche-&gt;Vanagon retrofit is so
easy is that the engine carrier is so much easier to fabricate
-- no bends, no welding -- and the stock bellhousing doesn't
need to be replaced.  The other Vanagon shop I talked to in
Germany said there was a DM10,000 kit to fit the Porsche engine
in the Vanagon.  Unless it includes an adapter to heat water in
the Porsche heat exchangers, someone's getting robbed.]
 
exhaust, 2 mufflers with pipes                        860
(outlet in front of left rear wheel)
 
clutch, complete, strengthened                        480 (from
AUDI Quattro, part numbers at home)
 
altered crank bearing                                  50 (VW
has 16mm, AUDI 20mm shafts, that's the reason)
 
replacement parts for bellhousing, release lever, bearing,
gasket etc.       120 (from AUDI 5000, Vanagon etc.)
 
holder for clutch cylinder                             69 (would
you like to have the drawing?)
 
extended gasline                                       70 (I
have to add this one of the next weeks)
 
2-piece exhaust heat shield                           112 (fold
your own from sheetmetal)
 
engine support, each (two required)                   115 (from
AUDI 5000)
 
reangled rubber part for induction pipe               145 (from
AUDI 4000 5 Cyl./ Rabbit etc.)
 
plastic extension with adapters for induction pipe    250
(what's this? I don't need it)
 
5 extended injection lines                            300
(needed for fuel distributors on right side only for Crewcabs)
[thus, regrettably, not a key issue in the US]
 
fabricated water pipes for equalization tank          120 (do
you have a knife? DIY!)
 
equalization tank with cover                           85 (from
Vanagon)
 
overflow tank                                          47 (from
Vanagon)
 
small filterbox for quantity tank [my Vgon is aircoold; no clue
what this is]   145 (I don't know what you mean, I will check my
catalog)
 
electric fuel pump                                    240 (from
AUDI 5000)
 
big prefilter                                          27 (from
AUDI 5000)
 
engine space height extension (about 4cm higher) with new lid as
original    280 (I figure out, only 2cm, 4cm for distributor
cap)[Westy owners note that the portion that needs to be raised
is not under the southwest cabinet, so you don't need to chop
that, but you do need to sleep a little higher.  With regard to
the Porsche engine conversion, only the heaterblower is under
that cabinet, and that blower would be easy to reposition, so
again, the cabinet could stay; you just need to raise the deck
in the northeast corner of the engine lid, where the Porsche
fuel distributor is.  Amount of extra height needed -- for
Porsche and for Audi5 for that matter -- depends on your taste
in ground clearance.  You might be able to hang the Audi low
enough to clear the stock deck].
