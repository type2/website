Subject: Re: VW-Air compressors

Oval's in Federal Way, WA seels kits to do it also, I've seen them at the
show, pretty kewl.  Guess they work great for all air jobs except painting
due to the oil in the engine, right? Oh well if anyone wants prices or the
phone number just yell.

&gt;See the top R/H corner of page 17 in the July issue if DB&amp;HVWs.  They are
&gt;still doing it. And with 800cc displacement it probably moves a bunch of
&gt;air.  And Cheap too!!
