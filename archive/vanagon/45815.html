Subject: 81 intermittent no start

matt goike writing from friend's account again.  i'm still far from home, 
bringing the van into the shop today to have them check out the chirping 
noise.  another problem: starter doesn't turn maybe one time out of six 
(buzz/click , but no turn).  doesn't matter if it is hot or cold.  
banging on the starter does 
nothing. i'm assuming it is in need of the extra solenoid fix.  i'm away 
from home, could someone forward me the procedure to put in the bypass 
solenoid i'd really appreciate it.

thanks, matt
