Subject: heat pipe redux; pressure sender


Well, I don't like having this oil pressure sender down under the tin - I can't
get it tight enough I don't think (can't reach the hex-head to properly tighten
it down) and so I think I'm blowing some oil out it. I'm going to try an idea
I saw someone else mention - use a brass &quot;riser&quot; and a coupler to bring it up
so that I can reach it! (Anyone know why Muir recommends NOT using teflon
tape? Is it because of ground connection? What else is there - joint
compound?)

Wasted my Saturday going into Seattle to find out about the pipe going into the
heat exchanger. It's a &quot;heater pipe&quot; - dealer &amp; junkyard seems to be the
only place for it. I chose the
dealer out of expediency. (I'm going to have to find out more about VW's in
junkyards around here.) They claimed its not for cooling, just to get the
air up to the front for heat. With my aux heater I guess I never missed it!

Until I get the part I'm not sure how it fastens to the upper pipe (the one
in the fan shroud) but there seems to be a clamp on the lower end - still
attached
to the heat exchanger.

just had to ramble a bit I guess,
