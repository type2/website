the brakes on our EV feel ok to me, but i don't have a vanagon to compare 
them to. they feel like normal brakes for a small truck.

the only problem i have noticed with the brakes occoured only once right 
after i had stopped in a water puddle that was deep enough that it must 
have been three quarters of the way up the tire in depth.

for the next several stops the brakes made a strange high pitched humming 
noise. it's been a couple of days and the brakes have not made any strange 
noises since.

i have had my arguments with the dealer also, but about the way the 
transmission shifts, and the poor fuel milage.

dureing gradual acceleration, as opposed to hard accelleration, the
automatic transmission often shifts at a much higher rpm than it seems it
should, causeing fairly sharp jerks. 

the dealer seems to be quite sure that the problem is with my driveing 
style, even though they have never taken a test drive in the rig with me 
at the wheel.

of course, it may just be that the dealer will blame the owner till the 
judge tells them otherwise, then they'll blame it on their lawyers, but 
it will never be a problem with the truck that they sold us.
