&gt;&gt;  A Dasher wagon??? 
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;  Yeesh.., thats spooky.......   :&lt;)
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;  buy an Audi Fox - they're better cars.....  :&lt;)
&gt;
&gt;But they're not diesels.  He wants a diesel.

Don't take me seriously, this is Friday, remember....  :&lt;) 
The Audi Fox *IS* the Dasher, and like the Dasher, IS also a piece of crap!!

I second the motion of a Quantum diesel, if you must have a diesel, rather than
a diesel V-gon. 
I rode in a '81 V-gon DIEsel today, and up the hills it did just
that.....DIE...... 
I could have gotten out and walked faster......
