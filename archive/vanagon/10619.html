Subject: Re: Eurovan Camper C/D Test

For most car magazine tests, curb weight is the actual weight of the 
vehicle, with fluids full, but *no* driver or passengers.

The weight that is used for licensing, and for truck scale checks, is
Maximum Gross Vehicle Weight, which is everything - curb weight + bodies +
all the crap we usually carry around.  I haven't looked at it for a while,
but I think the 82 air-cooled Westy had a gross vehicle weight in the
low 5000's - like maybe 5200-something - just enough to get it out of the
cheapest license bracket in Wisconsin (5,000 and under).  It's stamped on
the label in the driver's door sill - and I think there were also maximum
gross weights allowed for each axle.

I've never had the van on a scale to get the real weight - has anyone
done that?  What does a truck stop scale usually charge for some dork who
wants to weigh his or her private vehicle?
