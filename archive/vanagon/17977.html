Subject: Star Trek and the VW experience

There was a bizarre ST-TNG episode on recently. It involved the Enterprise 
coming across this race of seemingly mentally impaired collectors called Paklets
(sp). Their words remind me of the VW crazed:

They greet the Enterprise crew with the words &quot;We look for things. Things to 
make us go.&quot; When Geordi repairs their malfunctioning ship, they say &quot;You are 
smart. You will help us go.&quot; Then they decide to kidnap Geordi to get the new 
equipment and expertise they need. Watch out Joel:) and claim &quot;Then we will be 
smart. We will have things to make us go!&quot;.


-Still looking for things to make us go...
