Subject: diesel trans

My transmission, Im afraid, is not long for this earth.  It has been 
whining at me the past week and a half and lately its getting worse.  I 
can't have a conversation unless Im stopped. If Im alone, i turn the 
radio up REAL loud and pretend everything's fine! ;)
I took it to a VW specialist near me and he replaced the oil with some 
synthetic stuff.  It hasn't helped.  he said to just drive it til it 
goes,but I don't want to get stranded somewhere.
My questions are:
1.  Should I look into having it checked into a little more thoroughly, 
or is it a lost cause?

2. Are any of the other van transmissions adaptable or do I need another 
diesel 4 speed?  I read in Bob's trip report that he met with a woman 
with a 5 speed. Is this a canada only thing?

Im getting pretty frustrated with the problems Im having.  im thinking of 
selling and buying early 70's bay window. HELP
