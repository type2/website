&gt; Sneak into the helicopter maintainance company thats nearby and swipe
&gt; a turbine from an old jet ranger, and while you're there get some
&gt; guages and toggle switches to mount on the ceiling between the driver and
&gt; passenger seats. Back home cut up the vanagon engine leaving the
&gt; flywheel and some mounting spots. Once the turbine is in place (remember
&gt; to drain the gas tank and fill up with jet-b, or just plain kerosene), and
&gt; all the electrics connected (solder those crimps!) its time to fire it up.
&gt; Remember - keep the clutch pedal depressed until the turbine is at normal
&gt; operating temps - then raise the turbine speed to a point where max torque
&gt; is produced (any help out there with exact numbers?) - select first gear or
&gt; reverse (depending on how you parked the car the night before) and smoothly,
&gt; but confidently let the clutch pedal up. 
&gt; 
&gt; It will be time to shift sooner than you may expect.
&gt; 
&gt; Putting fins on the van and painting it black add a nice touch.

You're all laughing, but this guy is serious!  He already has a
Jettagon, and a garage big enough to hide a helicopter in while it is
being dismantled!
