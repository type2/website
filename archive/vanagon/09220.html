I missed the original post of this:

&gt; as I got home, I drained out the oil, and it looked awfull!  Not sludgy
&gt; looking, but almost like it was diluted with something!  It also had
&gt; a silvery sheen to it as it sat in the drain pan (I thought it might
&gt; be metal shavings, but I couldn't see any when I took a sample between
&gt; my thumb and forefinger).

but I saw David Schwarze's reply.

I used to have a 72 Bus and I had a situation where my oil was getting
thinner.  And fuller!  The culprit was the fuel pump--it was designed in
such a way that when it went bad it allowed gasoline to get into the oil.

Dave, I would check this.
