Thanks again! We kinda of suspeted a converter problem. It started to rattle
a few weeks ago. I guess we'll need to replace it. Are there any aftermarket
converters or are we at the mercy of VW. By the way we forgot to include the
new brakes,and curing the fuel smell,and the new rear hatch supports,along
with the weather strippng on our list of things we've done.
