Subject: '79 Fuel Injection Airflow Meter Adjustment

All,

While messing aroung with a used airflow meter I just bought, I 
discovered a way to boost horsepower dramatically.

First, I cleaned the whole airflow meter thoroughly with isopropol 
alcohol. Then I pulled the plastic top off the meter.  Inside is a 
sort of rheostat on a small circuit board which swings along a 
curved track from idle position (right) to full throttle open 
position (left).

I cleaned, with alcohol and Q-Tips, the tracks on the circuit board 
where the copper arm makes contact.  There's a small screw, similar 
to a points adjustment screw, which allows adjusting the amount of 
airflow &quot;advance.&quot;

I opened the airflow meter to fully open position and adjusted the 
copper contact arm so that it's as far as it will go to the left, 
without going too far, or off its tracks.

The power increase is amazing.  It tends to raise the idle a titch, 
but man is it a screamer now.

BTW, the ignition timing is right on and the dwell is constant, 
using a Pertronix Ignitor Hall cell points/condensor replacement 
unit.

Anybody have any experience like this with the airflow meter?  
Think it's a good idea?
