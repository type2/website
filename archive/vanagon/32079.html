Subject: Is your VW a SEX symbol?

     &quot;Volkswagen buyers are a special group.  When you buy a Volkswagen, you
don't just get a car; you also acquire a lot of friends - other Volkswagen
owners.  The Volkswagen is a way of life.   More than that, it is a
declaration of a certain attitude toward life and society.  The Volkswagen
owner is saying that he is concerned about economics, air pollution, and good
craftsmanship.  Volkswagen owners include students, professional people, and
executives as well as a large number of older retired persons  who appreciate
economy and ease of handling.  Creativity marks the Volkswagen owners.  They
usually take an intellectual and rational view of life.  They are
individualists.  A Volswagen owner is almost fiercely loyal to his &quot;bug&quot; and
does not harbor secret wishes to own a Cadillac, a Thunderbird, or a
Continental.&quot;

- from Is Your Volkswagen a Sex Symbol?, by Jean Rosenbaum M.D.  pub 1972,  a
pretty cheesy book that only devotes one paragraph to the vw of 194 pages.

but what a lure!
