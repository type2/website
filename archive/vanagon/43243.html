Subject: RE: 87 Vanagon: installing VDO oil pressure and temperature


&gt;Anyone know more about problems using teflon tape on oil pressure fittings?
&gt;
&gt;     Gene Berg instructions say to NEVER use Teflon tape on the senders.
&gt;     Don't recall the reason, whether it will contaminate the oil or just
&gt;     because with tape it would be easy to overtighten and possibly split
&gt;     the hole.

I'm not to familiar with the sensor on wasserboxer or type-4 engines.
But on all the upright engines I've seen ('71-older bus and all bug),
they have been one-wire affairs that rely on a good ground where they
screw into the engine. They have tapered pipe threads and can, I suppose,
split the hole if you screw them in too tightly. I've also seen them fail
where the little plastic insert that carries the switch and connnect tab,
becomes loose in its brass housing and starts to leak oil around the
plastic. Solution: replace it, they're cheap and easy to get to on
upright engines.

Is your oil pressure sensor, a one-wire type (for either a gauge or
an idiot light)? If so, wouldn't teflon tape on the threads, interfere
with the ground that it must have to the engine?
