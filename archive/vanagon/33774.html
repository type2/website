&gt; At risk of sounding like vintagvw list, the '57 single is a definite
&gt; thrasher with about enough bondo to sound like a city side walk when
&gt; knocking on the drivers side and looks like Davey Jone's locker near the
&gt; rocker panels and doglegs. The front cab half is basically great, as are the
&gt; gates (go figure) Cubby door hanging on with coat hanger wire. Doors rattle
&gt; like your standing under the Chicago &quot;el&quot; tracks. No low beams and only the
&gt; passgr side tail light/stop light. Cracked windshields with virtually slight
&gt; remains of fossilized seals holding them in. Paint job is misc oxide and
&gt; cheap grey primer with occasional rattle can tests &lt;exactly what I mean&gt;
&gt; here and there. The hoops and stays were pushed back an inch due to a low
&gt; over hang. Makes it look fast even when it's still. ;) Empty semaphore holes
&gt; with the wires hanging bare and no hub caps round out the look.  Drips like
&gt; a bad dog in heat. The new neighbors love it &lt;not&gt;. Hauls butt though! It is
&gt; a friendly and charming POS, too. ;) Hence the name &quot;Rusty VanBondo.&quot;

Sounds like a lovable old thrasher to me!  My truck may be only a small cut
above.  I haven't measured the depth of bondo, but it's got to be pretty
thick in spots (you should see the far wall of the cargo bay when the
door's open!).

&gt; Lets drop the thread.
