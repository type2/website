Subject: alternator problem solved?

Okay volks,

I think my alternator saga has ended.  As a refresher, 

1) alternator &amp; O2 light began coming on intermittently
2) after a week of flashing lights, van had to be jumped off
3) behaved wacky on drive home after being jumped off
4) voltage readings at battery were 2v higher than at alternator
5) contacts at alternator good
6) contacts at starter corroded galor--&gt;source of trouble!

Well the starter contacts appeared to be it.  The last time I posted
about this I was trying to get the sucker undone as it was rusted into
one big blob.  Kroil to the rescue!  After a LONG soaking and much
(wo-)man-handling, it finally broke loose.  All parts came off without
any damage.  Starter bolt was so rusted it was pathetic.  All other
pieces pretty yuck.  After much sanding to find metal again, I put it
all back together for a little test.  Sure enough, van started right up
without a hitch and the lights (which HAD been shining fervently by this
point) went out after startup.  Success!

It's too dark now to thoroughly test it, but the voltage at the battery
with the engine running is 13.8, which I think, might be a little low
still, but the battery was only at 13.2 with the engine off (due to not
being charged well recently!).  To be honest, the bolt still has rust on
it and the whole connection isn't tightened all the way (I was tired
from sanding and it's kinda awkward under the van right there--tight
quarters).  I was getting tired of sanding and wanted to see if I was
making headway.

Anyway I think my problem is solved.  Thanks to everyone, especially Don
Gibbons who suggested the starter contacts!
