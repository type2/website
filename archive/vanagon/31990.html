Subject: VWs in Southern Cal


I recently mentioned that &quot;The Recycler&quot; is the best classified-ad paper
in Southern California to find relatively rust-free VWs.

Turns out they have a Web Page! Or, more like a Web Volume-- all their
ads are on line! Try:

     http://www.recycler_dot_com

I did a search on &quot;VW&quot;, and got 1302 ads that matched, for this week's
edition alone. That is all 12 regional issues, and includes bugs, busses,
rabbits, jettas, golf, quantum, ghia, thing, mechanical parts, body parts,
accessories, etc.

The Recycler also has everything on earth to sell, from furniture to pets
to cars.

No, I'm not associated with The Recycler. If you thought I was, you're dumb.
