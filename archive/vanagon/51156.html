&gt;it's 46MM = 1+13/16&quot;, Get english size with 3/4&quot; drive, fits fine, costs
&gt;big, like $30-40, or try the rental, or go gor a beater bar remover tool,
&gt;&lt;$15 from JCWhipme.  bye, tim

I recently got one of the Pound-on-em-with-a-hammer types at a local VW FLAPS
named Barretts (I think they advertise in the VW mags) for about 5.99.  They
had both the 36mm and Vanagon 46mm sizes.  It has a place for a 1/2' drive
breaker bar to add constant force whilst you're pounding.  I have not used
mine yet, but I knew I'd need it before too long.
