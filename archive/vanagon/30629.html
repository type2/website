Subject: Re: Heat in a '74

Thanks for the tip.  It isn't really the heat I have a problem with, 
since it doesn't get below 35-40 too much here, but the defrost.  In the 
rain my windshield is a foggy mess.  I have a little fan attached to the 
dash, but it blows cold air on me as well.  Plus, it does nothing to melt 
the ice that occasionally forms on the windows.  Scraping removes it, but 
as I drive it reforms.  The heat gets to the interior ok, but without 
enough force to do much good.  It ends up fogging the windshield worse 
than if the heat were off.

Craig
