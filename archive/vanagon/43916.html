&gt;PLEASE DISTRIBUTE THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE 
&gt;TO ALL VA FACILITIES ON ALL SYSTEMS IMMEDIATELY !!!   
&gt;                                       THANKS.
&gt;THE MESSAGE FOLLOWS:
&gt;
&gt;The VA Austin Automation Center (AAC) has received a message from the
&gt;Department of Defense regarding a computer virus on the World Wide
&gt;Web.  If you have anyone at your station using Netscape version 2.0 or 
&gt;2.1, you should have them disable Java ASAP to avoid the possibility of 
&gt;picking up a Java virus.  Message from DOD follows:
&gt;
&gt;       URGENT!    URGENT!   URGENT!   URGENT!   URGENT!   URGENT!
&gt;
&gt;       WHAT IS THE PROBLEM --     A hostile Java applet is stalking the World
&gt;       Wide Web.  It is a Black Widow Java called JAVA.  Princeton University
&gt;       Researchers have found hostile java applets on the World Wide Web.
&gt;       They reside on web sites set up with a malicious intent, and are
&gt;       downloaded and executed automatically when an innocent user visits
&gt;       that site.
&gt;
&gt;       WHAT IT COULD DO --  These Java applets are programs that can destroy
&gt;       data and interfere with your network.  They may even upload sensitive
&gt;       material to a third party.
&gt;
&gt;       WHO DOES THIS APPLY TO  --  This applies to all users using
&gt;       Netscape Navigator 2.0 or Netscape Navigator 2.01.
&gt;
&gt;       HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELVES  --  The (DOD) Computer Emergency
&gt;       Response Team (CERT) staff recommends disabling Java in Netscape
&gt;       Navigator 2.0 or Netscape Navigator 2.01 until patches are available.
&gt;
&gt;       WHEN SHOULD THIS BE DONE -- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!!
&gt;
&gt;       INSTRUCTIONS ON DISABLING JAVA IN NETSCAPE
&gt;       1.  Open Netscape Navigator.
&gt;       2.  Pull down the Help menu.
&gt;       3.  Click on About Netscape.
&gt;       4.  Check to see if you have version 2.0 or 2.01.  If so, continue
&gt;          with the next step.  If not, then you can not be affected by the
&gt;          Hostile Java.
&gt;       5.  Pull down the Options menu.
&gt;       6.  Click on Security Preferences.
&gt;       7.  Under General, place a &quot;X&quot; in the Disable Java and the
&gt;          Disable Java Script box in the Java window.
&gt;
&gt;       This is a short term solution.  Netscape Navigator 2.02 is supposed
&gt;       to contain the fix as a permanent solution.
