Subject: Factory Cruise Control

I'm in the process of installing a complete factory cruise control
system into my '88 Westy since I had most of the parts from a donor
Vanagon.  I'm short the cruise control parts that mount on the engine
and I'm wondering if anyone on the Vanagon List might have some they
aren't using.  If you've ever gotten a complete replacement engine
from a wrecking yard you may have gotten an engine with the factory
vacuum servo and it's mounting hardware.  If so, I'd be interested
in buying these items from someone that isn't in need of them.

Thanks,
Kevin Disse
