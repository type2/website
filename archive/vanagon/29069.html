Subject: RE: Bolt extraction (with lasers)


&gt;&gt;two weeks, is that THIS &quot;OUT&quot; BROKE OFF INSIDE THE SECOND BOLT!  It broke
&gt;off
&gt;&gt;so deep that I had no hope of removing it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Been there, done that.

ME TOO!!!!!!!
&gt;

&gt;Does anyone have ANY success stories involving an &quot;easy-out&quot; that's actually
&gt;WORKED? Or are these gadgets the mechanical equivalent of Slick-50?

i'd like to hear about it too, there  a few broken off bolts that i need to
&quot;remove&quot;

michael
