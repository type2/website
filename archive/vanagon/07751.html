&gt; so finally, i went to the top: talked to the top-dog. he says it's a
&gt; salvage car. vwoa bought it back from the owner, and has stripped the VIN
&gt; from it. and they are letting it sit there (while paying the dealer monthly
&gt; storage fees) until they decide to come get it and crush it. :(
&gt; 
&gt; and all those camper parts are going to waste.

So can't someone buy it from them for parts?
