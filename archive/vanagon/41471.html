Subject: Potential Vanagon Tires

In preparation for our upcoming trip across the southwest, I decided to
replace two of the tires on my '84 Westy.  Ended up getting Michelin MXT
reinforced 205/70R15.   Max pressure is 50psi.  They really make a difference
in ride, ease of turning the steering wheel and handling. They were
expensive.  $114 each (ouch).  The tread is identical to the MX4 which is M+S
rated.  Curiously my tires don't have M+S stamped on them.

After I bought them, I saw some Michelin Roadhandlers(apparently a Sears
exclusive but has &quot;Michelin&quot; on the sidewall and not Sears) that are avail in
205/70 with a T speed rating, M+S rating and max PSI to 51.  They  are $68
each.  I may try these when I replace the other two tires.  Anyone have any
eperience with these?
