&gt;         I was driving around this weekend and noticed a small clack, clack,
&gt; clack when I made right-hand turns and applied power.  I may have
&gt; noticed it while going straight, but it was so slight that I'm not
&gt; sure.  I've never had a CV joint go bad, so I'm not familiar with what
&gt; that sounds like, but judging from what others on the list have said it
&gt; sounds to me like a bad CV joint.  Any other possibilities?  I have had
&gt; to replace the rear wheel bearings and this doesn't sound like that.
&gt; Also, what are my alternatives?  Can I just repack them?  Or do I have
&gt; to replace them?  Has anyone priced these parts lately?  What might I
&gt; need?  Is there any way to better diagnose the problem?  I've never
&gt; claimed to be mechanically inclined, so is this something I should leave
&gt; to someone else?  I'd really like to take an 800 mile trip this coming
&gt; weekend, so i've got to act fast.  (and if I repack, will I make it on
&gt; the 800 miler?)
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,

A common yearly practice here in Canada is to inject new VW CV grease
into the CV joints. The grease comes in a tooth paste type plastic tube
to which a stiff 4 or 5 inch plastic tube of about 1/4 inch O.D. is
screwed. You can slip this stiff tube under the rubber boot and into the
center of the CV joint. By squeezing the grease tube you can deliver new
grease into the joint and expel the old grease.

This is a simple, effective and cheap job :) but a a dirty one :(
