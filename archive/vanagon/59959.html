Subject: Re: Cruising Speed

I have put about 50K miles on my 87 westy.  Mostly highway driving, 
including lots of colorado passes (lived in Boulder for years).  I am 
usually pushing 75MPH on the flats (auto tranny = 4400RPM).  All of my 
VWs have lasted forever and I always keep the RPMs up.  Mileage drops to 
about 18mph though.  Besides, its cool to be in the passing lane and fly 
by thoughs type II's !!!
