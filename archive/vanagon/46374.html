Subject: Go with the split


I'm for the split.

Air-cooled's are still in production.  Advances, improvements are continually
being made. My 1965 bus runs better than it did when new.

Water-cooled's are orphans, not even supported by VW any longer, save in the
peripheral sense.  Valient efforts by a few to keep them alive thru engine
transplants generally get short shrift from their peers.  

Over the last couple of years of Vanagon list activity I've gained a strong
impression that the typical owner of a water-cooled VW van is not only less
mechanically adept than air-cooled owners, they seen less willing to acquire
the skills and invest in the tools that would keep their orphaned vehicles
alive, a failure of spirit -- or Fear of Grease -- that virtually assures
such machines will end up on the junk heap.
