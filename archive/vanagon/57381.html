&lt;&lt; &gt;Just remove the oil cap and pull on the neck of the tube. If at first you

 &gt;out of the access door behind the license plate.
  &gt;&gt;

oh, and I don't know if anyone mentioned this already or not - don't use your
oil fill cap to prop open the lisc plate door - It'll fall behind the bumper
and you'll spend a half an hour trying to fish it out.....  :&lt;)
