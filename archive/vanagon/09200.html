Subject: Synchro Westy?
Date: Tue, 3 Jan 1995 10:30:07 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

A guy here at work saw a westy for they first time the other day, and he 
thought it was the coolest thing, what with all the goodies like the bed, 
sink, stove, etc.

I also told him about the sychro vagen.  Did they make a synchro westy?
And what year did they start making the westy?  I'm thinking late '50s, but
I could be wrong.

If you feel like really expounding on the subject, then you can mail him
direct at bworsham_at_tim_dot_com.  He's new to the net, so be gentle!

Thanks!

Thom
