I realize this has little to do with VWs, but you folks have always 
been so helpful in the past with stuff like this..

I am seeking information on cities and towns in Montana and Wyoming.  
I will be departing on a trip next week to tour some possible towns I 
may want to move to in about a year. (not to get AWAY from it all, as 
people think, but to get INTO it all..  all that the big wide open has
to offer).  It is something that seems completely necessary in my life
at least for a couple of years, and I would be pleased to hear 
people's opinions of places to check out, both for the sake of this 
week-long trip and to survey for potential living arrangements.  
Bozeman, Butte, Helena, and Missoula are on my list for Montana, I'm 
not as sure for Wyoming.  My only real requirements are that there is 
some rough terrain, isolation from the masses of tourists (Is the 
surrounding Yellowstone area just as saturated as the park in the 
summertime?), horrendous winters, affordable rental property, a 
community with some variety within (possibly a college town or near 
one); and accepting to newcomers.  I am an adventuresome student 
looking for a change of atmosphere.  A specialized or high paying job 
is not needed (although I will need SOME kind of work), I'm used to 
living on less.  :) 

If anyone could suggest another newsgroup to post this to that might be 
more suitable for my requests, that would also be appreciated.  

Thanks,
Scott Steffens
