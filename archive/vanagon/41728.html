Subject: New Syncro Westie Website
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom F.)

I put together some links from the various sources already up, compiled a
Syncro Westie Registry, 
complete with photo links when available, and drafted a Syncro Westie FAQ.
There is a place 
for technical tips, initially I intend to link these to some comprehensive
articles in the HTML archives. 
 
I would appreciate your comments and suggestions. I definately need more
pix of Syncro Westies 
working the outer limits.... 
 
The direct link is http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm 
 
Thanks
