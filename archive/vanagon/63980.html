&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;While out camping in our '82 Westy this weekend my son and I managed to
&gt;break the water spout (the piece the water comes out of, I'm not sure if
&gt;I'm communicating well here or not) off of the pump down low where it
&gt;swings vertically.
&gt;
&gt;It appears I could just epoxy it back on, but am wondering if this fix will
&gt;be such a pain that I should just spring for a new one?  And if so, where
&gt;is the best place to get one?

Euro-American RV Products
5517 Cleon Avenue
North Hollywood, CA 91601

(This used to be Delta Six Industries, which originally supplied many of
the camper parts to Westfalia.)

Costs about $40.
