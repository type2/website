This is interesting.  Perhaps all syncros come with the longer studs?  Out
of curiosity how far do your studs extend beyond the alloy wheel?  I would
LOVE to not have to replace the studs!  TIA

&gt; &gt;Everybody, keep in mind that Cory's talking about mounting a &quot;Carat&quot; V-gon

&gt; &gt;style 5 spoke alloys, they would be smart enough to get the lug nuts and bolts

&gt; When I bought my 87 syncro a couple of years ago I also picked up a set of
&gt; Carat alloy wheels. I DID NOT have to replace any of the studs to mount the
&gt; alloy wheels..
