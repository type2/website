The GVWR means the total weight the vehicle is capable of carrying including
weight you put in it, i.e. passengers, gas, water, cargo, etc.

Your Westy probably weighs about 4,000 pounds without passengers and cargo,
but with gas, water, oil, etc.  This means you can put about 1,100 pounds in
it as cargo (including the weight of the passengers.

Hope this helps...

&gt;Hey,
&gt;All right, one of you gurus explain to me what the gross vehicle weight
&gt;rating (GVWR) found on the sticker in the doorjamb really means.  Is it
&gt;the actual weight of the vehicle?  My '81 Westy has a GVWR of 5093 lbs.
&gt;
&gt;If this is not the actual weight, what is?

&gt;Thanks folks,
