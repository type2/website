Subject: RE: Shift rod accessory

        Mine is not chromed but it is exactly as you described.  I got it 
        from some supply house in Oregon that does camper parts and VW 
        canvas or some such.  I can get the address of the place at the 
        next Transporters meeting (in about 3 weeks) if anyone needs it 
        and it doesn't appear before then.  We ordered a bunch of them in 
        bulk about a year ago and I don't remember many of the details.  
        In any event, it shortens the shift throw considerably.
