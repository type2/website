&gt;Inside the box, there's a food heater made of salt, iron, and magnesium.
&gt;When water is added, it becomes salt water.  This causes the iron and
&gt;magnesium to produce heat....and heat the meal.  Basically, you open the
&gt;included water pouch, pour the water on the food heater (which looks
&gt;like a bag of iron filings).  You repackage the food and it's surroundings,
&gt;put it back into the carton, and close the tab for 14 minutes, and
&gt;viola - a hot meal!

 The US Army started sending out heaters with the MRE's a few years back 
that operate on  the same principle. You throw your maincourse in the bag
 and put in a few ounces of water and after a few minutes its hot slop!  When 
they first came out I tried one and it did improve the edibility of 
 this crap. If you 
haven't noticed I don't have a great fondness for MRE's and can proudly say
that I have brought home everyone I have received for the last three years.
Incidentally the instructions tell you to place the heater tilted 
 against a &quot;rock or something&quot;
and warn you against drinking the hot water from the bag, I guess they 
 had a problem 
with troops using the water to make coffee.
