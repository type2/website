&gt;I own a Pinto...does it count for something????

saaaaaaaaaaaaayyy, didn't you Western Pre-Tour folks want a bonfire??? :)

ah, shucks ... i shuddna said that. :)  cause i've ridden in Pintos and they
are not really bad little cars. not good little cars, but they are not bad
little cars. :)  actually, if it hadn't been for the road salt rust, it
would still be 'alive' today. well, cept for that truck. maybe.

but the owner got his money's worth out of that car, i can tell you. and it
stood up to a LOT of abusive New York driving (both in new york and by new
yorkers). me, personally, i think the car got a bum rap.

which reminds me: did you guys know that 85 vanagons were once also the
object of an almost identical lawsuit? yup. the vanagon was cited as unsafe
because of the fuel tank location. !?!?!! &lt;the sue-ers lost the suit, by the
by&gt;
