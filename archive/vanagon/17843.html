Volks,

I have found the problem with my exotic 78 x 90.5 PEFI engine that stranded
me on the Pacific Coast highway.  The *&amp;(^_at_#$^^#_at_% Bosch W7AC plugs crapped
out.  There was never anything wrong with the FI system or engine at all.
This was not easy to track down and has involved days of ripping into the FI
system etc.  I sort of suspected the plugs for awhile, but just couldn't
believe new Bosch plugs could fail so futzed around backflushing injectors,
swapping injector banks, on and on.  I finally swapped out the plugs for
some old ones lying around, and, low and behold the cylinders picked up one
by one as I swapped.  I now have $.97 Champions in and it's back on the
road.  But not without swapping the entire FI system out for a stock 34
pict-3 (that of course didn't solve the problem).  I'm now changing the 10W
ND break-in oil to 20W ND, (hoping this fiasco hasn't ruined the break-in)
changing filters, and changing back to the PEFI system, since the 34 idles
rough with the cam/engine combination.

The plugs were sparking, but taking a close look with the plug outside, I
could see the spark move away from the center electrode and onto the
insulator, which had some carbon on it.  Three of the four new plugs I got
went bad, all at about the same time.  They suck, Bosch sucks, I will never
use them again, I will always carry spare plugs, right there with the fan
belt, etc.

PS, I have had great oil pressure even with the 10W oil, the light goes off
instantly when I first crank, and shows no indication of being anything but
good.  I almost hate to change it. 

Eug,
'71
