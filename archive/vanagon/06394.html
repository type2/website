&gt; 	Well, the morning paper reveals a 63 Crewcab, rebuilt engine,
&gt; new paint and interior. $4900. I talked to one of the owners last
&gt; night. They did a bare-metal restoration on it, overhauled
&gt; everything execpt the transmission, welded-in a new pillar
&gt; between the front windows and repaired all other rust damage,
&gt; and they've been showing it at the local bay area gatherings. 
&gt; (Its grey, with a roof-rack. Anyone seen it?)

&gt; 	How does $4900 sound for bare-metal-up, new rubber,
&gt; etc etc etc?

Here's my numbers. A clapped out, well used, bent gates, hole in windshield 
pillar, little rust, bad paint, etc, 1959 Single cost me $1000. I've put 
that much into again, and I haven't gone near the paint, 12V conv, 
upholstery, etc. Figuring I could put anohter 2 or 3 grand into making it 
pretty makes your deal there pretty good. Try $4000 for starters! :)

&gt; 	Having not seen it, my biggest reservation is that
&gt; I wouldn't want to damage the paint *using* it- I guess I'd
&gt; need a bed-liner too. Does anyone know of bed-liners for
&gt; split-window crew cabs? I guess my alternative is to make my own
&gt; liner out of marine plywood and epoxy paint...

Or you could replace the original oak slats that screw into the bed 
between the corrugations. That would be better looking, for sure.

&gt; 	Yes, I'm excited! Yes, I'll try it in all 4 speeds forward
&gt; and reverse. Yes, I'll ask to see the recipts, expect to see a
&gt; few K miles on the rebuild, look at the floors under the mats, etc.

Definitely check under the mats. When the windshield seals go, the water 
runs directly over the dash onto the floor, where it pools. Mine has some 
problems there...

&gt; 	My friend Rob recomends I ask about undercoating. Any other
&gt; suggestions? I plan to bring the Muir book with me and do the 
&gt; &quot;how to buy&quot; procedure.

This is California, right? I'm sure you don't need to worry about 
undercoating. There's virtually no rust under mine.

I say, GO FOR IT!
