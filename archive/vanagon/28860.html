&gt;Acceleration in the 83 aircooled 2.0 Westy from 35/40mph to 70 on flat
&gt;surface is about a week and a half.
Wow!  You can go that fast?!  My plain '82 diesel van only gets to about 65,
eventually (needs dowwhill and tail wind).

 &gt;My gas mileage really, really sucks.
Gotcha there!  30 mpg, town or freeway, day in, day out.

&gt;Going uphill is basically white knuckle time with everyone on my bumper. 
I can resemble that!  At least I get fuel economy as compensation.

&gt;Out side of that, I love it!!! 
Yeah, we are kinda fond of ours too, with 5 kids at home and 3 out of the
nest, it's versitility and capacity is unmatched..

&gt;Kinda like a fat ugly, blind,  chick with no
&gt;manners, no brains,  AIDS but with  a nice personality. ;)
In view of a recent and infamous thread,:  Batallion Artillery, Fire Mission,
Politically Unacceptable Analogy, Coordinates jim_at_atcweb.atc.1dc_dot_com,  Every
tube you've got for 5 minutes, Air Burst, Fire For Effect!!!  :-)
