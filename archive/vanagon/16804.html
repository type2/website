Subject: Re: New Jersey emissions law (was: Why are so many....)

&gt;Wrong-o. They do put out more emissions than new cars, but if one follows
&gt;the advice you gave above, the difference is small. 600ppm HC is tiny compared
&gt;to, say, a smoking clunker. Or even compared to spilling some gas when you
&gt;fill up.

I stand corrected.  Properly maintained older cars aren't that bad,
especially compared to untuned clunkers or (ARGH!!!!!!!) leaf blowers.

&gt;As long as we poor oldie-buffs are willing to keep our &quot;horrible&quot; cars in
&gt;first-class shape, I hope you will find it in your heart to allow us
&gt;to do our thing, since in fact we are hurting nothing.

Okay!  I admit I love seeing an old breadloaf going down the highway.  (And
I suspect that they're emissions saints compared to those huge old boats
some people drive.)

&gt;P.S. Might I predict that, 20 years from now, people such as yourself will
&gt;be screaming about those &quot;horrible&quot; 1995 cars, which pollute 10 times as
&gt;much as their new 2015-year models? It's reasonable to expect that that 
&gt;ratio will be true by then. But the '95s will be polluting the same amount
&gt;as they do now. You'd better junk yours now, to avoid being &quot;horrible to 
&gt;the environment&quot;. There's always bicycles.   ;)

You're probably right, though I'll be screaming about people who are
petrochemical burners and haven't yet gone electric. :-)

I have to point out that in 2015 we'll probably have 10 times as many cars
on the road.  Any emissions cuts count.
