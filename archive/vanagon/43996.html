Italy was one of the countries where you could order a Baywindow with a
1300 DP. Even the SuperBug convertible was available with a 1200 there.
The reason is their road tax system, goes by HP or CCs i guess.

Here in Europe one could order the 1200 SP in most Bugs until they
were discontinued here somewhere in the 80s. The 1300 SP was available
upto somewhere '73 and there was the 1300 DP was quite popular in the
SuperBugs, Baywindows could be ordered with a 1600 DP upto '79, they
did have the large engine compartment though, the 1600 SP disappeared
here around the same time as in the US. Fuel Injection was never
available on Bugs in Europe.

All Bugs -except Supers, saxomats and sportomatics of course- came with
swingaxle tranny, the MexiBugs too. The IRS could be special ordered
on any post-late-60s Bug but i've never seen one The torsion front-
end/IRS combo chassis' are rare here, especially the Germans want them
for high performance purposes. If you ordered a 1600 Bug you got
diskbrakes on the frontaxle as well (lets make that &quot;most of the time&quot;,
there might be some exceptions)
