Subject: oil change help urgent

Crawled under the 81 to do my first oil change as a newbie and the oil
drain plug is stripped. Also the parts in the manual look different than
what's there it shows a bolt requiring an allen wrench and mine is just a
regular nut.

Everything is spread out on my driveway and I can't get the damn oil drain
plug out!

Should I just take it to a oil changer type place?  I really want to do
this myself!

help!
Thanks
Maggie
