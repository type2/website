&gt; Subject: Fuel gauge sender on 60's split

&gt; My question is: There only appears to be one connection to
&gt; the sender. Should I disconnect the ground and attach the
&gt; gauge wire? Or is a ground neccesary as well? If so, where
&gt; do I connect it? Both wires to the same connection?

I saw no answer provided, so I will fill in some blanks.
The &quot;one wire&quot; sender setup assumes that the sender unit is
grounded.  The brown wire from the gauge with the female
connector on it should attach the the male terminal on the
sender.  In addition, a ground wire (probably with two
&quot;loop&quot; connectors) should be attached to one of the screws
holding the sender to the tank and to the body for a good
ground.  Both wires are normally brown.

&gt; Thanks for the help!

That be why we be here.
