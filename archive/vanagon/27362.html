Subject: Need Ideas for Converting Interior of Bus

hey now,

i'm gonna start converting the interior of my '74 plain jane bus into a vehicle
for some serious roadtrips this weekend. i've got a good essay by Roy Robertson
and want to look at any more that may be able to help me. is there a ftp site
somewhere i can download some plans, ideas, etc?

projects may include: building bed frame, installing cabinents, gas heater,
etc etc.

any help would be appreciated!
