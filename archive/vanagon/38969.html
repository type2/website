Subject:       building a more powerful v.w. engine.

I know this isn't incredibly bus related but what the hey.  I've been
thinking about buying a '70's standard beetle and building an engine 
for it.  I was just wondering if I should start looking for a used 
1600 or if a later bus engine would bolt up.  I want to put in a 
cam, larger cyls, pistons, etc. and it would be nice to have the 
bottom end of a 1700.  how about prices?  I imagine it is probably 
cheeper and easier to find parts for the 1600.
thanks.
Ed.
