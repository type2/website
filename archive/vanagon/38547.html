Subject: Sysop help needed

My provider has changed our system, my new email address is now
&lt;stirling_at_rof_dot_net&gt;.  Is this a problem?  And if so, what do I do to correct
it?  Or, can you just change my registration info.  Also,  some time in the
next month or so I'll be moving and will have a different provider will I
have to unsubscribre and resubscribe, or can you just maunually change my
address.

Thanks for your help,

James
