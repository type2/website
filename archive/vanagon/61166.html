Subject: re: new syncro stuff

So if you will pose your question and note your query to me/us again, not on a
Monday, I will try to do better.

'89 Syncro Beast
'86 Scirocco
'87 GTI (so much to do!)

Thanks Carl for your kind reply. I am still learning: Last time I learned to 
avoit Fridays because everything might be mixed up with 'friday' fun-stuff. 
Today I learn to avoid Mondays or Weekends because of the lot of mail on a 
monday morning at work. Slowly, but hopefully we get it together in the end.

So once again for you the original text (slightly edited in the meantime):

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Dear listees,

you wont believe it, but there is a realistic chance for a new VW off-road 
vehicle now - and if we do it right, it will be a Bus.

with the news and jokes about a new Splittie the following message may be 
confusing. We can promise you the news is authentic deriving from &quot;Gute Fahrt&quot; 
which is the offical german VW and Audi custumers magazine. (You will get the 
original ad copied on request if desired).

The original german Text is:

&gt;&gt;
Sagen Sie uns Ihre Meinung !

Volkswagen und Audi sind die Spezialisten fuer allradgetriebene Fahrzeuge. 
Trotzdem fehlt seit den 80ern nach Iltis und T3 syncro 16'' ein richtig 
gelaendetaugliches Fahrzeug im Programm.

Vermissen Sie einen Gelaendewagen von Audi oder VW ?

Fax Nr: +49 - 711 - 4 58 78 98
&lt;&lt;

Which means translated into English:

=======
Tell us your opinion !

Volkswagen and Audi are specialists for four-wheel-driven vehicles. 
Nevertheless, since the 1980s - after Iltis and T3 syncro 16'' the model-range 
lacks a vehicle with real off-road capabilities.

Do you miss an Audi or VW off-road vehicle ?

FaxNo. +49 - 711 - 4 58 78 98
=======

Our comment:

The Iltis was a special military design - so what should a new VW off-roader 
look like other than similar to a syncro 16'' Vanagon ? So the logical 
consequence would be a T5 syncro 16''.

So we do kindly request **everybody** who would like to drive such a new 
syncro or syncro 16'' eiter:

-  to send a fax directly to Gute Fahrt No +49 - 711 - 4 58 78 98 maybe in 
English language of course. 

-  If this seems to much bother to you - no problem. Just sum up your ideas 
about an ideal VW off-road camper or van and mail to the Ig syncro 16'' 
mailbox [cct_Tom_Niksch_at_MSN_dot_com] We will forward it for you through fax !

- you can directly access VW Nutzfahrzeuge via their Internet mailbox:
http://www.vw-nutzfahrzeuge_dot_de/com/mailer/mail.htm
[ &quot;Gute Fahrt&quot; can  not to be accessed directly by  email or Internet]


Important in any case: Please refer to the opinion-poll in &quot;Gute Fahrt&quot; (issue 
06/97; pg. 8)

As this poll has probably been initiated  by Volkswagen marketing dept. it 
would be a perfect opportunity to send your personal wants to them. If there 
is enough reply - even from overseas, which they never will expect - there is 
a good chance that dreams become reality in a few years and you just have to 
step into your local VW dealer's and order a new syncro wherever you may live 
- Stuttgart, San Francisco, Stockholm or Sidney.

If you know of any people, club, web-site or organisation all over the world, 
who might be interested in a new 4x4 Vanagon, Eurovan or whatever it may be 
called then  - **please** forward this message.

Thanks in advance to you all

Looking forward to your comments 
Thank you once again for contributing your time to this.

Bye for now
