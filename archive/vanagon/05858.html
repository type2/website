Subject: Showing my '56 Bus
Date: Sun, 30 Oct 1994 17:17:51 -0800 (PST)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt;

	
	It all started with a knock at the door...

	Last night, some unidentified youts (sic) came to out door wanting to
buy my '56 (again)  I wasn't here, so they talked to my girlfriend, and
they mentioned a how 'n shine the next day at Carmicheal park.  I figured it
was some generaic car club, and there would be 1 or 2 VW's.  So we show up
about 10, and there are about 10 busses and a few other air cooleds, as
well as a few water pumpers.
	
	This was a totally informal event put on by a small local VW club, and
it was kinda cool.  No big attitudes, T/A (it would have been nice, tho)
or any crap.  Best of all, there were _REAL_ cars, no fluffed up, trailered
things that were never even run. 

	The split bus contingent was far and away the largest, with several
21/23 window entries, 5 single cabs, a double cab, a barndoor, a couple
panels, and several kombis and standards, and a '54 Barndoor.  Oh yeah, and 
a bread-loaf Westy!

	I'd driven the 911 over, but after male bonding with a group of early
bus guys (and a couple girls!) I sez - &quot;hey, my bus is BETTER than some of
these!&quot;  So I bailed home, fired her up and drove over.  Luckily I live
about 3 minutes away from there!

	So I made my late entrance, and lined up with a '60 panel and a '57
standard!  It was so cool, to have someone who actually cared about my bus!
(all my friends think I'm crazy...)  The sunroof was an especially big hit.
I had the 3rd oldest bus there...  Gotta follow up that lead on that '53 
standard...

	What was even more interesting, is that most of this group knew each
other pretty well, and they've done a lot of trading/selling of parts 
between them, so it was kinda interesting to hear &quot;hey, thats my old bus!&quot;
several times throught the day!

	I didn't stick around long enough to see who won the show - but they did
have trophies and prizes, and a pie contest and a soda slamming contest!  
Kinda like a mini-bug-o-rama - without the IRS inspired gate fee!

	Well, now I'm inspired to work a little faster on this project!

See Ya
Thom
