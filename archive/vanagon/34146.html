&gt;I have a few questions about vanagons.
&gt;	1. What was the first year for the square headlights?
&gt;	2. Are the vanagon automatic tranmissions prone to failure?
&gt;	3. I've heard stories of coolant leakage at the cyl. heads, is this a
common
&gt;
&gt;problem with the waterboxer engine?
&gt;	4. Are there any other notable quirks about vanagons that would be handy to

&gt;know while looking for one to purchase?
&gt;
&gt;

86 first year for square lights, along with 2.1 liter engine, improved
FI,(Digifant),  larger front brakes, and Mettallic rear shoes.

Transmissins very reliable if kept filled with ATF and gearlube in the final
drive.  Overhaul parts for the Automatic section is available at your local
trans. shop.  Final drive parts very expensive, but last forever!

Look at other list entries, vanagons have lots of quirks.
