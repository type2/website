Subject:      Microbuses

for you 1949-1967 microbuses:

i just got a kinda strange little note from some people claiming to have
a database of 1300 Microbuses, wanting to know if i had one. they had heard
that i had a list of bus people and wanted me to share it.

well ... being the somewhat suspicious person that i am (who!? where!?),
i sent them only the folks NOT on this list ... i mean, if *I* can get their
names and bus type and email addresses from newsgroups and mailing lists,
then so can most anybody else. i hope.

anyway, rather than turn them loose on the list members, i figured i'd tell
you guys about them, and let you decide whether to contact them.

they are:

Lori and Anthony Gelato         Gelato _at_ vax88a.pica.army_dot_mil
10 Chamberlain Avenue
Budd Lake, NJ 07828

they gave their phone number but i forgot to write it down. i'm including the
address in case anybody in NJ has heard of them.

like it said , it was a little bit strange to get a note from someone you
never heard of, asking about the buses, but maybe i'm just getting old and
suspicious in my old age. (?) :)

besides. i drive a vanagon. vrooomm. vrooommm. ;)
