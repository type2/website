Betreff: 	Buying VW overseas?!?!

I have a brother-in-law in Switzerland wanting to pick up a military VW bus
or a VW bus to do some traveling in.  He is hoping to bring it home with him
when they return stateside in the winter.  I was hoping that all of these
wonderfully knowledgeable people on the list may have some suggestions that I
can send to him. 

1) How to obtain one 
---
Shouldn't be a real problem to get some VW Bus in Europe anyway. What you 
should consider is that especially in Austria and Switzerland winter is real 
snowy and you may bring a lot of rust to the States.

Military: In germany there is an organisation that sells ex-military and ex 
public-service vehicles . As sometimes you are not even allowed to start the 
engine neiter then to test the car on the road, you may end up in trouble. 
Most are bought by specialized dealers who do some repairs and than sell 
again.

You may get a mil.vehicle that has made only 10,000 km in ten years, the other 
time beeing stored somewhere. But: Thinking about my own time in mil. service 
and my &quot;career&quot; as a driver I wouldn't give a &quot;dime&quot; for most of the mil. 
vehicles at all ...

2) Where to obtain one 

---
Every major newspaper has private and commercial ads for VW Transporters
---
and 3) What to know to be able to transport it back stateside?  
---
The more interesting is probably the Tax, duty, exhaust check,  registration 
stuff

Peace, love and volkswagons....Christine
