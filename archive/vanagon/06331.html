&gt; I think all that air gets under the front, so that any side vector can do your

&gt; a bus or Vanagon is loaded heavily in back.  I now figure the back of the van
&gt; is doing its share just carrying the engine, so I try to load the heavy stuff
&gt; immediately behind the front seats.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone lowered a Vanagon?  I look at the coil-spring brackets that JC

The effect I experience with my '91 Westy definitely &lt;&lt;feels&gt;&gt; like air 
is getting under the vehicle - a definite sense of ducking and bobbing, 
along with the sway, however it's got the front air dam that supposedly 
reduces the under vehicle air flow.  My 82 camper, which didn't have the 
front air dam, behaved much better.
