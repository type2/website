Subject: Sliding Door Handle

Argh! My outside sliding door handle broke off yesterday. Broke! The metal
inside just under the lock looks like it was ripped apart by some wild
beast. Is this handle going to be easy to find and replace? Any ideas on the
best place to go for it? My Vanagon is an '82 GL. Oh, another thing -- does
anyone know if it is &quot;safe&quot; for me to use the inside handle to open and
close the door, or is that one in danger of falling off, too? The drawing in
the Haynes manual leads me to believe the handles were not attatched in a
straight line. Thanks for any help.

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
