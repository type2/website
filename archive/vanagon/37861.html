&gt; hip, horray! Hip hip, horray! Hip hip, horray! I only wish I could offer a
&gt; cold one over the net. Maybe someday!  ;-)

Sure you can (sorta)!  Haven't you ever heard of the &quot;Beer of the Month&quot;
program?  You &quot;subscribe&quot; and you will get a sixpack of microbrew
delivered to your (or someone elses) door every month - a different brew
each time!  If anyone wants details on this, I can find out from my
uncle who has been subscribed for a while now.  Surely someone on the
list could treat Gerry to a year of this - maybe we could have
a volunteer from the list buy him a subscription each year, or maybe two
or three subscriptions (more beer!). 

&gt;         Serously, many thanks to Gerry for the countless headaches he
&gt; endures so's we can bicker amongst ourselves... And even learn something
&gt; occasionally!   ;-) ;-) ;-)

I second that.

-David
