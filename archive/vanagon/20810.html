&gt;From: Joe Clark &lt;jclark_at_nexus.polaris_dot_net&gt;:
&gt;Isn't it also true that the '69's have rear defogger wires?  That was 
&gt;always a Q&amp;D way to differentiate w/o measuring cables, etc.

Mine does.  Not that there is continuity or anything through the wires.

;-)

I checked the wipers as suggested by BusBoys.  Yup, they had the locknut,
but...they were silver like the 68s, not black.

I think all these posts show that VW had a continuous product improvement
program, transitioning one model year into the next over a period of
time, rather than by discrete jumps (except for the major style changes).  
It seems like the safest way to tell the year is the VIN.
