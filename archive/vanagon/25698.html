Subject: RE: 71 WESTY AND DOOR HANDLES


&gt;You do not have to repeatedly turn the key back and forth to get the
&gt;door to unlock. If you do, you will eventually break the key or the
&gt;lock barrel.  The purpose of the little broken spring is to move the
&gt;lever out of the way. You can move the lever by pounding with your
&gt;fist several times just above the handle. Then unlock the door
&gt;normally. When you get around to it, replace the broken spring with a
&gt;spring from a retractable pen. Stretch the spring to the appropriate
&gt;length, and use needle-nose pliers to fasten the ends.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone knows a source for the right spring, please let us know.

Bob, can you describe where this spring attaches?  Either I didn't see the
pring that looks similar to one for a retractible pen or mine is missing.  I
realy would like to get the doors to operate as God and VW intended!  

Now, the springs I've seen on my excursions through the door mechanism are
the tiff wire spring that is at the back of the lock barrel, the coil spring
(i think) that rests against the push button, and  what I would describe as
a clck type spring that you see when the inner door panel is removed.
Should there be an additional spring somewhere else?

Thanks,
Ron
