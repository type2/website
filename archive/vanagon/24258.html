&gt;      
&gt;      wow, $220!!! the repair sections (the corregated sheets) should only 
&gt;      cost about $25 each max!

The $220.00 is for two new floor halfs, exact reproductions.  When doing 
a resotration on something this old and on a bus in otherwise great 
condition, I don't want to skimp that much and rely on patches everywhere.
