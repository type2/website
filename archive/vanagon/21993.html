Subject: Keys for Things

What I would really love is to get working 'original' VW keys for my two 
things.  I have several other questions for any 'key' experts.

Any idea where I can get original Thing key blanks?  Its hard but I've 
been able to get non-VW key blanks ground for one of the Things?

I understand the door handles for Things are the same as door handles for 
bay window buses - are the locks and keys the same as well?  Would this 
help me get 'VW' keys?  The 'original thing key I got for one os the 
roundish key with a black rubber cover.  The other key I have for the 
other looks like the key for the '72 bus my family had - asymetrical 
rounded triangle but an aftermarket copy not an original 'VW' key.

Anything I can do to get locks to match between the two Things I got?
