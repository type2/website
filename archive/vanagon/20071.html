_______________________________________________________________________________
All the recent threads re: flammable substances, exploding batteries and 
other general stupidity made me think that others on the list have 
encountered other interesting road hazards. Anyone care to share?

  I was driving to work in my bug years back (worked nights), car of
  surfers driving ahead of me (about four car lengths)... saw one of
  their boards become airborne, got some pretty decent altitude, spinning
  and tumbling and it occurs to me &quot;that thing is going to come through
  my windshield and kill me dead&quot; -- good time for a lane change.

  Couple/three miles down the road I passed the surfers, puzzled look and
  absurd baggy swim trunks wonderin' where their stick was, dude.

  All in all, I was happy not to have been skewered by the thing...
