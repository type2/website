&gt;Actually, a question about the wire that holds the curtain against the wall.
&gt;Where can one buy replacement wires?  They appear to be springs in a plastic
&gt;coating.  Any idea where one could find these?

an alternative is to use &quot;shock cord&quot; ... elastic cord which can be found
in fabric shops or yachting places. you can make a loop at each end, then
tie-wrap the loop with thread or use a quicker copper or aluminum strip
which is crimped over the strands. or even heat-shrink tubing, if you are
creative. ;)
