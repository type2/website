Hey all,
Watching the Michael J. Fox movie &quot;The Frighteners&quot; on video tonight I saw
a nice early '80's maroon colored Vanagon (round headlights) in a funeral
procession.

BTW, good movie :)

Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah (that's probably spelled wrong, but I don't
have much practice), or happy whatever your particular religious sect
celebrates!

Sean
