Subject: Re: weird happening

I'd check the head temperature sensor - if it is going bad the engine dying
thing will happen more and more frequently.     You need and volt ohmeter,
it'll say how in a Bentley or a later idiot (Muir) book.  It screws in near
#3 cylinder, and has a wire that pushes on to a terminal.  It's real easy to
change.
