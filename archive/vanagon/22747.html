Subject: Used compressors and air tools


Peter asks about air tools and you replied: 
 
&gt; Peter, look for a used compressor, 3-5 hp, 20-25 gal tank, this would be
&gt; minimum. In finding one used, you might get some used tools with it. The air
&gt; tools are a lot less expensive that electric, they don't weigh as much and
&gt; folks don't tend to steal them as often. You can use air for lots of
&gt; different things, blowing out the shop, filling up tires, powering air tools,
&gt; etc. I've got an air drill, air rachet, die grinders (2), impact wrench and a
&gt; few other specialty tools. Changing tires is great with the impact wrench. I
&gt; picked up a few hundred feet on air hose and I can sandblast outside (did my
&gt; house/foundation this summer) and when I do my roof, I will rent an air
&gt; nailer. Just having compressed air to blow/clean things is worth the price of
&gt; the compressor. 

In the case of the used compressor, I would highly recommend that people
do *NOT* buy a used compressor. Compressors have a nasty habit of rusting
from the inside out. All the compressed air causes a lot of condensation
in the tank and condensation == rust. Rust weakens the tank until finally
BOOM. shrapnel everywhere. No matter how good a compressor tanks looks
from the outside, you don't know what the inside looks like.

I once worked in a machine shop where we had a compressor tank incident. 
Fortunately in that instance, there were no injuries.

However, I feel that there is nothing wrong with used air tools.
