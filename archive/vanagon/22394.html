Subject: Leaks, part 2:  my diesel leaks
Date: Wed, 9 Aug 1995 16:07:15 -0600 (MDT)

Hello vanagon gang,
Here is the promised part 2 of leaks.  My diesel seems to leak in the
area I imagine to be related to the auxiliary heater.  Has anyone had
this problem before?  My vanagon is a 1982 diesel.  Thanks.
Stuart
