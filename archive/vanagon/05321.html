&gt;1. Joel, do you scan these articles in, or do you &quot;hunt &amp; peck&quot;?
&gt;(hint....becareful...what you say might be sent to the govenor
&gt;of Allybammah   ;-)

the fleet fingers of my fat little hands race across the keyboard to bring
you all the news that fits. :)

'Lil Jimmy? oh,he don't care what we do up here in Tooka-looka. as long as
the germans build that plant up here, and he gets to ride around in his
Mercedes-Benz 600SEL, he's happy as a pig in a mud-wallow. (and that's
pretty happy, folks).

&gt;2. As Winnebago aparently uses the front end of the EV...does that
&gt;mean the chop off the ass-ends and can them, or do they buy
&gt;EV &quot;noses&quot;?

what i had read in other magazines, was that VW was shipping over the EV
long wheelbase with only the cab attached. but that meant that there WAS
already a chassis/frame all the way back to the rear wheels. so what do
these Motorhome folks mean about Winnebago 'building their own frame'? i
can't believe they would chop off what is already there ... i think they
are building a 'frame' for the camper part and fixing it to the chassis
that VW provides. i don't think they would chop anything off and throw it
away ... much less go through the labor to remove all the brake lines and
a-arms and wheels and such.
