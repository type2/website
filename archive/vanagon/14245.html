I think you're talking about the swing lever, Dave. The king pins are on
either side of the axle where the wheels pivot when steered. I think the
king pin job is similar to the swing lever job, i.e., lots of pressing and
honing of bushings.  I think your bus has ball joints out there, so 
you're out of the woods.
