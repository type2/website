Subject:      Well Done!

It being Friday, I wanted to shine Ron and Chris a little. List admin stuff
is not too important to anybody but list admins (probably because, well,
it's dull ;). But I can tell you that these guys took your donations and
went out and got you the best list processor in the universe, the best SMTP
server, loaded it into an extremely muscular machine, and gave it its own
trunk. If this list were a car it would be a Mercedes 6000-series. I envy
it.

They weren't daunted by Listserv's hairy learning curve, either. My
compliments.
