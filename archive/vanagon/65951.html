Subject:      Norcold altitude kit for 95-97 EVC's

Hello fellow Eurobaggers,

It looks like the logjam on the Norcold fridge high altitude fix is finally
breaking;  I'd like to think that our Internet campaigning had a partial effect.
My 95 EVC just got the kit installed last week; now I got two look-alike exhaust
vents; took the camper up to 6,000 ft over the weekend, no problems experienced.

The warranty issue is not clear to me, it seems to be treated on an individual
basis, also to depend on the owner's location. For completeness of technical
information I'd like to add the following to my Norcold fridge summary of 17.jul.97:

- biggest source of trouble for such an absorption type fridge: water condensation
  corrodes the interior of steel pipes, consequently rust accumulates in the burn
  chamber; another big source of trouble is water (from driving in the rain, washing
  the car), dust, bugs, leaves, etc. getting in through the air intake/exhaust vents
  to clog the burn chamber; a simple design fix would be for the exhaust pipe to
  slope up from the vent (thereby draining outward), before bending down into
  the chamber;  older Westfalias used to have an exterior vent cap, meant to attach
  when the camper is in storage, but also usable when the refrigerator is not on LP
  (this is dangerous if one forgets to remove it); some custom solutions use a
  velcro attachment

- known temporary fix: cleaning the burn chamber and sooted rods regularly;
  unless I learn to remove the unit myself, I am looking at a $140 service bill, at
  least once a year; this is labeled &quot;maintenance&quot; (as opposed to a design or
  installation problem), therefore is not covered by any warranty

- diagnosing the need for maintenance:  unlike the Winnebago manual description, the
  flame is not visible below the fridge, through the grill (color an indication of
  burning quality) even after the installation of my &quot;high altitude vent kit&quot;;
  Chris Low claims he can see the light; I wonder why mine is obstructed

- 12V DC mode is effective in maintaining low temp only during long driving periods:
  engine-off disconnects DC cooling, engine-on-again means cooling only after
  a significant delay;  one needs to precool the fridge before 12V DC use

Rick Gordon, you may wish to add this info to your EVC web page
cheers,
Andy Mera
