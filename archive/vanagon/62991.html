&gt; &lt;&lt; For what it is worth, I also thing the legacy engine would make a better
&gt;  choice.  Correct me if I am wrong but did the 6 cylinder come only in the
&gt;  SVX?   &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; the flat 6 came in the mid to late '80's XT6 also.

But in a smaller and much less reliable form if I'm remembering
correctly.  Wasn't the XT6 engine about as big as the current 2.4
whereas the SVX engine is more on the order of 3.0 liters I think.
Plus the XT6 heads had a rep for problems.  IMHO it would be damn
hard to beat the loads of early Legacy 4 cylinders available for
peanuts (under $500) in yards and that 16V will probably move you
fast enough.  Now I'm not objecting to the SVX mill, but it will be a
tad bit harder to locate one of those in a yard, not many around and
they handled too incredibly to be wrecked, did have some tranny
problems early on.
