Subject: Re: ever taken a cat on a camping trip?

&gt;Maria and I are in the process of planning our next camping trip that
&gt;should take us from St. Louis to the Great Lakes, Quebec, New England and
&gt;down the East Coast to N.Carolina. 
&gt;
&gt;This is our dilemma: we adopted a declawed cat, that as far as we know,
&gt;never ventured outside a home. We could ask friends to take care of him in
&gt;our absence, but we're also thinking about taking him along. Before we
&gt;spend any time getting him acquainted with nature, we're wondering if
&gt;anyone on this list has had any experience with taking a cat on a camping
&gt;trip and would like to share it with us. (No worries: either way, we'll do
&gt;whatever is in the best interest of the cat!)
&gt;
&gt;TIA for your opinions!

My wife claims as a child she took her cats camping. One of them ran away
and at other times other cats behaved fine. As an adult, I'd like to take
her cats on a LONG camping trip. (No worries: either way, the cat will do
whatever it wants!)A lurker friend of mine breeds and shows cats maybe he
could respond for a change. How 'bout it?
