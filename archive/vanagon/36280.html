Subject: re: '88 Westy - high miles

&gt;'88 just came up at the local dealer for $9995 - looks *very nice*.
&gt;Has been repainted, but no major rust on seams. New Conti tires.
&gt;Interior looks good. Mileage, well 320,000 km...!

    Wow, that may be a mileage record!!!  price is very good for an
    '88 Westy otherwise.  Find out about that rebuild (full
    details/parts list), and who did the paint too, no point having
    it blister off in 2 years.  I prefer to see repainted cars that
    have had two+ years on the paintjob, as the rust bubbles will be
    coming through if they are going to.  A freshly painted vehicle
    if not done by a reliable place is a gamble.

    Check the engine for water leaks!!!  Check the PS rack for
    leaks, and at pump too. Check condition of exhaust system, both
    of these are big $$$$ items. Check steering bits, cheaper to fix,
    so not so worrisome. Front brakes will cost $350-$400 complete,
    so look at the rotors. Dicker with the dealer, nice to get OEM
    fixups as part of the sales price.  Check the front heater fan
    for screeching/binding, it's about due. Listen for clunking CVs,
    a rebuilt axle is $140 here, cheapest/best fix. 
-----------------
Just spoke with dealer: vehicle is a one-owner and has all receipts 
since new. New engine/trans/driveshafts at 160K... hmmm does that 
mean it's due for another new engine at 320K.... ?? What's the 
consensus here? Does this logic apply, or do wasserboxers defy all 
logic?

It sure looks nice, but it's starting to feel just like the last two 
wasserboxers I almost bought, until the fear of leaky head gaskets 
snapped me out of it.
This fear was not helped by my uncle's experience last month: a $2600 
bill for a rebuild on his '89 at 220K, which started out as 'just a 
leaky head gasket'.

ps: Sorry if I'm beating a dead horse on this one...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
