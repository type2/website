	Apparently you have not seen the back end of the Winnebago 
Eurovan.. it has a neat little compartment of the left rear... it 
contains a sink and Shower/spray nozzle on a 3'-4' rubber hose...

	didn't see any info on whether it is heated or not, but it 
looked like it could have been.  Was told by a &quot;Salesman&quot; that those 
Winnie Eurovans have a 5 gal propane wateer heater in them...
