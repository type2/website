Subject: Re: advice on exhaust repairs needed

Hi. I just purchased an after market cat. converter, and it came with one 
regular gasket and one metal doughnut gasket.  Is this right?  The 
bentley shows two regular gaskets.  It looks like 2 regular gaskets on 
the vehicle now (though I haven't taken it apart).  By the way, it's an '87.

Thanks

david
