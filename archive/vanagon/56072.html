Subject: Re: the '82 Diesel Westy Rolls again....

&gt; 
&gt; BTW, the vacuum pump +flange design is one of the worst flops I've
&gt; seen done by VW engineers.  I bet they were not thinking that this was
&gt; a vacuum seal rather than a pressure one when they designed it -- it
&gt; is definitely made to fail the wrong way, and looks like it was
&gt; designed to keep the pressurised air inside, not vacuum. 
I'm assuming this is different from the Jetta/Golf vaccuum pumps? I 
haven't had trouble with mine yet, aside from melting a hole in the 
plastic line by accident.  
&gt; 
&gt; One side question:
&gt; To get at the two other glow plugs, looks like I'll have to remove
&gt; the Diesel injector pump.  any hints, insight there???

I've done it a few times now - you're right, it's nearly impossible 
unless you enjoy skinned knuckles and swearing...

Last time I did mine was during a head gasket job, so it was easy. If 
you do remove the pump, remember the timing should be adjusted 
afterwards. 

ps: Do you know the inner two glowplugs are bad? You can usually 
remove the busbar to test them and maybe prolong the job a bit longer 
if they're ok.
