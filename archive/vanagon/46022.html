Subject: I still need a 12v horn...


Well I posted to the 'serv about 2 weeks ago about needed a horn for a 
friend.  I searched all the local junkyards and the horns are either 
missing or rusted so bad they have chunks falling out of them.  

Anyway, one of you replied and said that if I could a wait a month you 
would have one for me.  I appeciate this but I need it a bit sooner than 
that.  Out of desperation, I aclled JCW tonight and ordered the horn and 
a Kombi/Deluxe/Micro/splittie repair manual (yikes - almost $75) only to 
be told that the horn has been back ordered until the 25th.  I decided to 
cancel, hoping that someone will have one.  

If I don't hear from anyone by next week, I'll scout around and see if 
anyone else has them in stock.

Thanks for reading (and helping me if you can. )  :-)
