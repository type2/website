Subject: OIL API Service Levels...

Hi Everyone.  I've been doing some research on engine oil for my 
diesel Golf, and found out some really interesting information.  The 
CC/CD/CE ratings are now obosolete, and can no longer be used.  For 
light duty diesels (like VW's) oils rated SH will work just fine.  I 
have a technical service bulletin that was faxed to me by Castrol 
Oil yesterday on this.  I spoke to the tech person for some time on 
this topic and what oil can run in my car.  I've been using Castrol 
XLR and then GTX oil for years, and the last case of Castrol GTX I 
just purchased just had the SH API rating only.  This is when my flags 
went up.

I retyped the document and I have it in TXT format should anybody want 
to see it.  I didn't want to send the attachment to all 500+ of the 
list as this information is only relevent to diesel owners.  If 
anyone is interested, send me an email and I'll forward you a copy.  

Gerry, would you like a copy to store on the archives??

Harry.
