&gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone tell me exactly what the vents at the bottom of the front
&gt; &gt; &gt; doors are for?  Should they be slid to the front or back to keep the air
&gt; &gt; &gt; flowing or warm the bus up? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ha!  We now have a few answers:
&gt; 
&gt; A.  They do nothing
&gt; B.  They blow out air similar to the dash air
&gt; C.  They suck stale air out of the cab

Sorry, I posted the &quot;blow ambient air&quot; one but I'm wrong.  I played with 
them today (traffic was monotonous and it was hot out) They very 
definately draw air out of the cab.  Where it goes, I don't know.  Maybe 
somewhere in your door there is a ball of air  compressed to a solid from 
all these years of being packed in there  :)
All I know is that these VENTs are great for VENTalation and so long as 
it's not too hot out, you can keep reasonably cool with these and your 
inletting VENTs open.  (Shit I can only fit it in 3 times.).
