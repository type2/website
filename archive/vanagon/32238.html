Subject: Idling and Brakes

1.  What's the regular idling rpm for an 85 Vanagon.  My Vanagon does 
about 1200 when the tempture is 5 degrees and after a highway trip it 
idles at over 2000.

2.  My brakes make a loud grinding noise after I've driven the Vanagon 
for a while.  The sound is not a squeek nor is it scratching or 
scraping.  The brak guy told me that was natural for Vanagons becuase the 
breaks heat up so quickly.  Any answers?
