Yes, in the last couple of journeys our 84 GL has smelt of rotten eggs -
something like stink bombs (hydrogen sulhpide?). It seems related to the
heated air output from the front when the car is moving fast, but not with
the blower. My other thought was the battery being charged/overcharged
since I could think of no other system that has anything like those
chemicals, but I could not smell anything close up when the car was
stopped.

Has anyone ever come across this sort of smell? Should I look for a stink
bomb or a dead animal or something?
