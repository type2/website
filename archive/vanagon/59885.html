Subject: Re: Speedometer markings


&gt;according to the 83 WB owners manual:
&gt;&quot;after the break-in period, the following speeds should not be exceeded:
&gt;Manual transmission
&gt;Gear     after 1500km
&gt;  1         25km/h      (15mph)
&gt;  2         50km/h      (30mph)
&gt;  3         80km/h      (48mph)
&gt;  4         top speed   (imho: about 80 mph :)

&gt;in the OLD models of vws, they had little &quot;bars&quot; that marked the shift mph 
..
&gt;not dots. i don't know what the dots are.

I also have the described dots on the speedo on the '80 Camper. They have
the same meaning as the 'shift bars'.

&gt;i generally shift like this: (shift OUT of the gear):
&gt;1st    after rolling, at or less than 10 mph.
&gt;2nd    about 25-30mph
&gt;3rd    about 40-50mph
&gt;4th    :)  i wish i did have a 5th gear sometimes!!

Forget it, on the five speed you may use the first only for starts at steep 
hills,
the other working like yours.

&gt;3rd gear is the most commonly used one for me, from about 25 to 50 mph, 
around
&gt;town.
