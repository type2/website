Subject: MSRP prices for 1989 Vanagons wanted

Vanatics,
I am compiling a Model Year Summary for USA Vanagons for 1989 and would like
to inlcude the MSRP for the vans and all of the options.  If anyone has an
original window sticker or other reliable price data, I'd love to hear from
you.


Thanks,
Jim Davis
