&gt;good news!  I hope you don't mind me asking, but what did this cost?
&gt;just for future reference!

Paul,

Geez, I really don't know.  It came as part of the clamp/circlip/grease
package from Transform when I bought four new CV joints, boots and
transmission. The kit was not cheap but very good quality.  SWEPCO stands
for Southwestern Petrolem Corporation.  They're based in Fort Worth, Texas;
Antwerp, Belgium and Toronto, Canada.

The National Lubricating Grrease Institute (NLGI, of course) gives it a
rating of GC-LB.  Please don't ask me what that means.  On the tube it says
that it's an &quot;excellent multi-purpose, non-melt, EP lubricant for industrial
or fleet applications.  SWEPCO 101 excels in severe operations caused by
moisture or high temperatures.  SWEPCO 101 seals out dirt and water and
prevents corrosive wear. Laboratory and field field experience have proven
SWEPCO 101 to be highly effective in a wide variety of applications
including electric motors, central lubrication systems and as a fifth wheel,
bearing, and chassis or water pump grease and in many other industrial
applications.&quot;

Now I've smudged all the keys on the keyboard and the mouse with this black
crap.
