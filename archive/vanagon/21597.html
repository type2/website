Subject: Free Vanagon??

OK, here's the second installment of the free South Carolina vanagon. Quick
background: Kate (my wife), Twist &amp; Shout (cats) and myself took Blushie (my
1971 camper) on a trip to Charleston, South Carolina for a vacation. While
looking for vintage acoustic musical instruments, we found a friend of ours,
but didn't know he lived there. He owned the music store. I bought an old
Romanian mandolin from him and he threw in a 1980 vanagon at no charge.
Sure, it was free, but it doesn't have an engine and I live in
Indianapolis. How to get the bus home. That's been the question.

Last week we went to blues camp in Elkins West Virginia to take blues
music lessons for a week. My friend showed up with the keys, title and even
the owners manual. Now I'm set.  The weekend of August 4-5-6 we head back
down in a 6 cylinder Chevy pick-up to get a U-Haul 2 wheeled car dolly
and pick the thing up and tow it back to Indianapolis.

Should be an interesting trip, to say the least. I usually name my
vehicles after women, but this on will be named Roger, after the guy
that gave it to me. It's white over yellow with a Santa Fe landscape
painted around the sides including cactus and adobe houses. There's a
set of Texas steerhorns painted on the front. In Roy Rogers type rope
letters it's painted on the side &quot;Roger Bellow and His Drifting
Troubadours&quot;. I promised not to change the paint.

After it gets home, we plan to do some body work, pick up a rebuilt
engine and head off for Iowa to pick up a camper interior from a guy I
met through this listserv. This will be a well travelled bus by the time
it's completed and makes it's maiden voyage. I'll keep you posted on the
progress. Any ideas, advice, criticism, well wishes will be greatly
appreciated. Jim Kirk
