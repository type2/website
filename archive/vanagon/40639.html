        I was just curious as to what some of the other prices in Canada
were for a van. Im in Alberta and it seems rather pricey here compared to
everywhere else, possibly due to demand. Maybe I can find a better deal
elsehwere instead of limiting myself to a purchase here. Either that or
else maybe I can find something thats alot better quality than what Id pay
for here.

        Here's hoping.
