&gt;Thats James T Kirk to you, buddy!
&gt;
&gt;And thats the dilitium radiator, dammit!

Dammit Jim, that's exactly what it is. I think the consensus is correct. 
This bus does have AC. It must go with the condenser. I've never had a VW 
with AC before. It sure looked like a full sized radiator to me. You can't 
see it from the front of the grill. It can only be seen from an inspection 
from beneath. I happened upon a Haynes manual today for this bus. It's a lot 
more consise than the Bently manual on the subject of fuel tank removal. I 
just have to remember gas is petrol and the front end is called a bonnet!
