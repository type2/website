Subject:      Reasonable source of rear bumper for '87 gl?

Hello, my wife was parking the Vanagon by the braille method and
banged up the rear bumper pretty bad. Luckily there is no body damage.
We priced a new bumper from the VW dealer and the price was over
$400.00. That seems like a lot of money for the thin piece of chromed
metal that makes a bumper.

Is there any chance of finding a good bumper in a junk yard? Or is
there a better source of new bumpers?

Thanks!

Later. . . . . . . . . Brad
