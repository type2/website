Subject: yet another oil temp. gauge question

Hey all,
OK, I am soon going to order the VDO oil temp gauge and sender which I will order from RMMW unless I hear from Jim SOON!  Main advice has been to install the gauge so that power for the light runs through the resistor for the other dash lamps so that I can dim it with the headlight knob, etc.  So, how would I do this?

This is a '78, btw.  Now, I'm not to sure on this, but it seems I remember that the dash lights run from a grey wire/red stripe that runs from the headlight switch from one of those really small push-ons.  If I recall correctly, there is another really small push-on immediately adjacent to that one.  Could I wire from this small push-on to the gauge and expect it to work as described above or will I have to do some cutting and splicing?
