Subject: Re: Hi Speed Vanagoning 

My $0.02 on this..

Don't do it much now, vanagon has enough power to beat most transports, but
in my '71 Westy I made a fine study of the art of transport 'surfing'.  

Rules of engagement:  the trans will likely pass you on the down hill and
leave you standing, out of draftable range so...  anticipate this and slow
down a bit so that it passes you more quickly and you have some power
reserve to accelerate into its wake.  Once inside the wake you'll have more
than enough 'power' to stay there, up to RPM limit.  Mexican overdrive can
help on longer downhills.

Getting into the wake...  first you need to get by the bow wave from the
trans and within its shielded zone.  Be prepared for that massive sideways
push and go a little wide as the tractor passes you then dive in on a
collision course to punch through the bow wave. Momentum carries you through
the wave.  Watch it because once inside you close fast.  Bumping your mirror
on the trailer is too close.  As the trailer just clears you flash/dip your
headlights to get them to pull back into your lane as quickly as possible.
You want to arrive on the bumper 10-15 feet back, so flash at about 6 feet
and get ready if the driver has a hair trigger on the steering wheel.

Staying in the wake...  rule 1) don't peak around the sides, this will rob
you of some essential draft.  Besides, you need to watch the brakes lights
anyhow.
#2) don't fall back more than 15'.  If you start to feel any buffeting
you're getting hit by the vorteces that are being shed from the back of the
trailer.  These come off each side alternately and are really what gives
drafting its bad reputation.  If you are positioned properly you can move
around a bit in the quiet zone to feel the envelope where smooth economical
(relaxing?) cruising can be achieved anyhow.  Two philosophies to reassure
yourself with are:  no way can this sucker stop faster than I can, and, if a
rock or tire cap blows off the trailer wheels it'll only hit below the
glass.  See! feel better already?

Be prepared for the driver to flick you off his tail when passing another
transport by cutting in fast.  This leaves you defenceless, in the wrong
lane, maybe going up hill, maybe with the passing lane ending and no power,
next to an evilly grinning trucker.
