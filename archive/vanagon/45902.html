Subject: Here is turn signal wiring for 63

&gt; Subject: Need turn signal wiring info for '63

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; is.  If anyone has an older Bentley, or any wiring diagram that
&gt; indicates which wire is which color, and could somehow send me the
&gt; page that deals with the turn signals, I would be forever indebted
&gt; to you.  I'm really not looking forward to trying to hook up that
&gt; many wires on strictly a trial &amp; error basis!

I have no 63s to go by, but I do have a full-color wiring diagram
for Type 2 USA Version (from August 1962) Chassis No. 971.550.
As I read it you have a T/S switch with 6 wires coming out of it.
Three of them go into a 3-way connector to split them before they
go on to other places.  While getting you a copy would take some
doing, I can provide the following:

Circuit
on Switch  Color         Destination(s)

54Sl   Black/Purple      T1 connector and stop light switch
54Bl   Black/Green/White Terminal S on Flasher Relay and on to
                            Em. Lt. Switch
VR     Black/Green       T1 connector and 87b on Em. Lt. Relay
                            and on to FR T/S
VL     Black/White       T connector which goes to
                           1) FL T/S
                           2) Terminal 87 on Em. Lt. Relay
HR     Black/Red         T connector which goes to
                           1) Em. Lt. Switch
                           2) RR Turn Signal
HL     Black/Yellow      T connector which goes to
                           1) Em. Lt. Switch
                           2) LR Turn Signal

Note that a T1 connector is just a way to connect 2 wires, while
a T connector connects 3 wires.  These are probably all under the
dash or behind the kick panel.

What is not clear on this diagram is what the terminal numbers
are on the emergency light switch.  I checked my Clymer and
Autobook diagrams and neither of them have terminal numbers on
that switch either.  Since I usually deal with 67 buses, I am not
familiar with the emergency light switch on a 63.  Can anyone
else with a 63 shed any *emergency* light on this switch?

Hope that much helps.
