Subject: Clutch/Shock correlation

I swapped my KYB gas-adjusts over to the 'new' '71 westy and the old shocks
back to the whacked bus.  I removed the HD sway-bars from the whacked car
also.  Much to my amazement the clutch shudder that I had in the whacked bus
was nearly gone without the sway-bars and gas shocks.  This is a surprise
because I was certain the shudder was from the flywheel running out of true.
Pretty badly actually, I had to smack the flywheel good with a sledge to get
it to run less than .006 wobble (long story, don't ask unless your psyched).
I guess the gas shocks caused the clutch cable housing to tighten up enough
that it was binding.  Learn something new every day.  Old whacked bus sure
drives slushy now though.

Eug,
'71's
