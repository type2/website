Subject: Re: Syncro on the Dunes?

&gt; the Beetle's rear wheels gently sank into the wet sand until it was resting 
&gt; on the oil-pan &amp; bottom of the chassis. Then the tide began to come in... 
&gt; We left the engine running as the tide came in. The car was 30 feet 'off 
&gt; shore', in 8&quot; of water or so, and showing no signs of floating, when
&gt; the tow truck guy arived. He pulled the car out in a minute or two.
&gt; 
&gt; 	4wd would have just dug-in the front wheels too.

After having taken our Westy on roads even a syncro would be proud 
of, I was somewhat surprised to finally get 'er stuck in a dead flat 
patch of sand near a river bed. All the common techniques only 
served to dig the wheels deeper until the exhaust was nearly in the 
sand. Luckily friends towed us out, but I will no longer 
underestimate little patches of sand...

And, no I don't think a syncro would have fared much better here 
either. (When we get one, I'll be sure to find out, though! ;)
