Subject: Re: shipping wheels

I shipped 4 Corrado alloys/tires from FL to WV 15&quot;  20+ lbs each via 
good old UPS for about $17 each if I recall correctly, things is I know 
UPS does deals for Tire Rack etc much better, like $10 a piece for a 
wheel and tire mounted and balanced, don't know exactly how they do 
it, guess the volume and being a commercial shipper.  The UPS was still
a good deal for me based on what I gave for the wheels/tires.
