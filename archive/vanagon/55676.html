Subject: Near stall on right turns???

The vw gods are really checking me out to see if I am worthy!!
After A fuel Pump Problem
	No start (new Harness)
	New idle control unit
	Water pump disater 200 mls from home
	New thermostat housing
All in about 4 weeks I now have a weird Problem
ie. when turning right corners under load the beast almost stalls I have 
to back off throttle and coast around Then its ok on the straight?
I not that knowledge able but have though of two possibilties
	1,junk in fuel tank or something in filter(but why only on right 
turns?)
	2 there is a noise from the back also on right turns that sound 
a bit like a drive shaft or cv joint (kthunk a! kthunka! etc) is it 
possible this is binding so bad that it stall the engine?

	OH vw almighty Iam really Trying To be worthy but its so hard!
thanks guys
