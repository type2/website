Subject:      Re: Tow Bar for 78

&gt;I am looking for a tow bar for my 78.  I put out the word on the
&gt;vintagvw list and only learned not to get them from performance
&gt;auto.  If anyone knows where I can get one or have any sugges-
&gt;tions at all please let me know.  (I hate to admit it but I'm
&gt;too busy at this moment to work on it and I want to go
&gt;camping.  I need to tow it to Mad-town to see the good doctor.)

check with U-Haul and Penske and all those truck-rental places. that way you
wouldn't be 'stuck' with the thing once you got it to the fixit-shoppe. i
have no idea how good these things are nor if they are cheap to rent. but if
it's a local (50 miles or so) and you are gonna bring it back to the guy,
it might work out better than building or buying something. just a thought.
