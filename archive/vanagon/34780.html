Subject:       1974 VW Bus Price?




I know there is a great range out there but I am looking for a
ballpark price on a 1974 VW standard Bus.  The Bus looks pretty clean
and straight with all the trim and glass there, and the insides and
seats are in pretty good shape as well.  The engine was very recently
rebuilt localy and seems to be ok.  The owner claims to have just put
$2000 into the Bus and wants to sell it for $2500.  This seems a
little steep to me but thats why I'm posting this to the list.  What
would a clean, strong running 1974 Bus sell four in your area?
I also recently aquired a 1983 240 DL Volvo and might be able to work
some kind of a trade on the Bus.  Let me hear from you bus people out
there.
