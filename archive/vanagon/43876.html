&gt;Hi I'm relatively new to the list and was hoping someone had a spare 
&gt;owners manual to an '82 Diesel Westy.  Unfortunatel, the PO threw out the 
&gt;&quot;non-essential&quot; items such as owners manual, spare tire, jack, etc..
&gt;Fortunately, it was a steal at $400!! ;) I bought the Westfalia manual 
&gt;from the dealer, but the van manual is out of print. Thanks

There is a company that sells used car owners manuals, they buy them too for
that matter. I got one for an old dodge 2 yrs ago, no problems.
