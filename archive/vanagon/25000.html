Subject: Rocker Panels (Attn: Laurie)

&gt;        Hi All

&gt;        Jim &amp; Tomh

&gt;Seems I rember a thread around here about this topic,
&gt;and as I get further into rust removal of my 59 pickup,
&gt;I'v decided to go looking for thies things, some of the
&gt;local have them and some can get them for buses, but are
&gt;not shure they can get them for trucks, and they dont know if the
&gt;bus version will work on a truck.

&gt;Now I know the bus and trucks are different on the back,

&gt;but..... any one know if the bus rocker panels will fit and

&gt;work out on trucks???

&gt;In the thread that was!!!! I think ya gave out some names of
&gt;manufactures, could ya put a rock in it and throw it at me again.

&gt;Thanks Laurie

I may be the wrong Jim (I have been that before), but I may
be able to help.  Since I have the same problem with my 67
double cab rockers, I would appreciate knowing what you find
out.

I have three possible sources for rockers:

Das Bulli Haus
18 Ward Lane
North Franklin, CT 06254
(203) 642-7242

Bus Stop (Rocky Mtn....)
1003 Tamarac Parkway
Woodland Park, CO 80863
(800) 544-5357 (sales)

Bus Boys, Inc.
18595 East Lake Blvd.
Redding, CA 96003
(800) 792-BOYS

Note that the Bus Boys catalog is the only one which has

*ALL ITEMS ABOVE FIT BUS &amp; PICKUPS UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED*

at the bottom of the page with body parts on it, so that
*may* be a clue.  I remember a post here that recommended
buying the *inner* rocker from one place and the *outer*
rocker from the other, so quality and fit must really vary
from one supplier to another.

Good luck with your 59!
