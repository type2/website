Subject:      bed conversion, bumper questions

Hello,

    I have found a vanagon which I am interested in buying, but I first want
to make sure that the fix-ups I'll have to do to it aren't going to cost me an
arm and a leg.

    I am interested in installing a Weekender-style pull out bed.  Is this
possible (the van is a 84) ?  Are the fittings the same for the normal seat
and the puul-out seat ?  Has anyone done this ?

    The rear bumper is missing, and I was quoted &gt; $800 for a new one.  Will I
have trouble finding a good bumper at the junk yard, and how involved is it to
replace this ?

    Thanks in advance for any advice !


-James
