Subject: Buying my first brick...wish me luck!

My wife and I are going out to see the '87 Vanagon found at
http://www.lib.iup_dot_edu/~glenn/vanagon/vanagon.html 
this weekend.  From talking with the owner, he's run the cooling 
system gambit including head and gasket repair and rear heater core.  
The brick has about 163K miles.

Anything else I should watch out for?  Other advice for new owners?  
I did notice that the Bus Depot is right down the road from me in 
Perkiomenville (PA Dutchie country).  

:-o
