By the shock treatment, do you mean tightening the puller firmly (but not
so much as to distort the puller) then giving a smart whack to the end of
the puller (where you attach the wrench)?

This has worked for me when I took the arm of a steering box, but I know
how some are stuck unimaginably tight.
