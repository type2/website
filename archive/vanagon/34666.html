Vahid,

I read the other replies to your situation and they strike me as excellent
advice. I concur, don't buy a stick welder!

You need to find a wire welder. The good ones(Lincoln, Miller) will cost
you about $700 all up but are well worth it if you have the money.
Otherwise, you should rent a small wire welder(MIG). Mine is the Lincoln
SP-100 which is a 115v machine so it plugs in to any 15-20 amp fuzed
outlet. It puts out much more power than is necessary for sheet metal work.

I have tried to weld sheet metal with a stick and it is nearly impossible.
The wire welder, on the other hand, does a very nice job. You will need
some practice or instruction to make good looking welds.

When welding long seams put a spot at the beginning and end and then in the
middle and then successively halve the distance between welds. That way the
metal doesn't get hot and you don't have sheet metal warpage.

I use 0.030&quot; mild steel wire with an argon(75%)/CO2 mixture. It works quite
well. I have rebuilt the whole left side of my '74 including making new
jack supports. I used a piece of metal that runs laterally between the
supports and up to the side support. As I recall the piece was about
18&quot;x48&quot;.

I put in a new seat attachment plate which I manufactured from some 3/32&quot;
steel. I think it is a lot stronger than the original.

In addition I have welded in many smaller pieces where the metal is rusted.
You will need a sabre saw and a good number of blades to cut out the &quot;old&quot;
metal. I have a very small aircompressor (3/4HP) with a small tank and I
find that I can use an air gun to cut the sheet metal if I am not in a
hurry. It has made the job pretty easy when the sabre saw couldn't be used.

You need to take care to clean both sides of the joint to get good welds.
Also, you will need to figure out how to &quot;clamp&quot; the pieces together prior
to welding. I use a combination of clamps, Vise-Grips and pop rivets.

You will need a 4&quot; or 4 1/2&quot; offset grinder to smooth up the welds prior to
covering with Bondo.

I have been very satisfied with the work. It is fun to see the old van get
back to as good or better than new condition. It may be a tad heavier as 18
gauge is more than the original metal.

Good luck and let use know how you progress.

Herb
