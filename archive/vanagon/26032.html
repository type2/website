Subject: Clutch Cable

I had an old aquaintance tell me he has a '75 bus for sale, strong engine 
(35K on rebuilt engine??), decent body, all around good condition, hardly 
any rust at all.  Only thing it needs is a clutch cable.  Is that expensive? 
 I can't imagine it would be - even if it was done for you at a shop.  He is 
just into Mustangs etc., and doesn't want to deal with a VW (Is he crazy?).  
He want $500.

Well, ????????

Thanks!
Paul Smiley
