Subject: Brass drift

	Brass drift is the bad habbit of British rock musicians, adding
a brass section (hired musicians often substantially more tallented
than the original band) as they run out of original ideas. Its ok if
the musicians themselves play the brass instruments (Brian Jones, John
Entwhisle). Note how it affected The Beatles, The (later) Stones, Genisis, 
etc. If the Sex Pistols had lasted, they would have had a brass section by
their fourth record, you can count on it. :)

	But probably you'v missed my multiple, annoying, postings
of how to make a brass drift. Go to the hardware store or surplus
metal place (cheap!) and buy 3/8&quot; or 1/2&quot; (10-13mm) brass rod, at
least 9&quot; (225mm) long. If its longer than about 12&quot; (300mm) cut
it down. File the end(s) flat if needed. Now you have a brass drift.

	The brass drift is a neat tool for applying force to steel parts.
its softer than the steel, so it won't damage them. Get used to filing
the end flat though- tell people you've got the 'dress' the end if you
want to be snooty about it. 

	Brass drifts are very convenient for driving bearing races in 
and out of brake drums, for example.
