Subject: Synchro Westy

I am considering looking for a synchro westy, or a regular one. here is my
question:

what is the difference in fuel economy between the synchro and an
equivalent 2wd.

can a synchro be used for daily transport without too much fear of
ex$pensive breakdowns.

thanks,	

Stephen White
