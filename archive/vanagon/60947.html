Please, I need some advice on the above vehicle.

I am going to look at the vehicle tonight and I have
never owned a VW in the past.  However I have done
a fair bit of body work and have the tools to repair and repaint.
Mechanically I am comfortable with most maintenance repair
and replace, but I have never rebuilt an engine.

What are the problem areas on this vehicle?
What are the areas to check out?
What are costly repairs?
How is part availability and are the prices reasonable?

BTW, the FAQ sheet were a great help in learning more
about this vehicle.

Thank you in advance
