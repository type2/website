Subject: Re: ..TD conversion 

in response to td conversion questions

&gt;Are you using the standard diesel injector pump or the pump for a
&gt;turbodiesel along with the added turbo?  
   
  I am using the standard inj pump with a slight adjustment for more fuel
  on the fuel delivery adj screw.  It seems ok for power with mileage still
  running around 27mpg after some trial and error.  A lean diesel is 
  happier than too rich a mixture?

&gt;I'm working on a similar conversion.  Did your use of the Quantum
&gt;manifolds allow you to retain the standard diesel left motor mount without
&gt;modification? 
   
   No change to the motor mounts were necessary to get it the turbo to fit.
   I did not try fitting the Jetta style manifold, and I am not sure what the
   factory TD vans used, the qntm manifold ends up with the turbo drain
   close to the pan oil level.

&gt;Does the van (with the turbo) have a better top speed? All the posts
&gt;I read talk about 60 mph tops
   
   Before I did the conversion, top end was around 65 mph, now it will
   hit 75 mph pretty easily, my '83 camper has the 5 speed trans. which
   probably helps.  The hills and merging with traffic are the most
appreciated
   change, I still cruise at 60-65 mph.
