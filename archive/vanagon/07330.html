Subject: Re: heavy steering wheel

My 84 vanagon's steering seems getting heavier. This is not good especially
I am getting older every year. I am afraid that someday I might no longer
able to handle it. I know I can add more air to the front tires which helped
when the tires were new. But my tires are almost 50kmiles old now. Too much
air might upset it and cause unwanted tire failure.

Is this a common problem or what? Or am I really getting too old? My 83 westy's
steering wheel is not as heavy but it has brand new tires on all four wheels.
I am planning a trip to Las Vegas during Christmas. I am worrying if I will
have the needed arm strength for the round trip.
