&gt; &gt;the door locks on my bus feel &quot;dry&quot; when I turn the key in them.  They
&gt; &gt;work fine, just don't feel smooth.  What can I squirt in them to lubricate?
&gt; 
&gt; WD-40 was designed, formulated, manufactured, made, constructed,
&gt; perfected, and maybe blessed by the Lord Himself for this application.

Not to poo-poo any recommendations from &quot;the man&quot; :), but I'd highly recommend 
sticking with the earlier posts of the graphite powder. Liquid lubricants, such 
as WD-40, tend to collect dust and grime and gum up over the long haul. If you 
want to do the ultimate job, take the locks all apart and clean them with some 
kind of solvent, let dry, and coat with graphite.

The quickie version is to coat your key with graphite and  stick in the lock a 
few times. BTW, I believe this is the officially recommended VW &quot;maintenance 
procedure&quot;.
