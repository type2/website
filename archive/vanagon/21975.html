Subject: Re: Top ten reasons to drive a VW (again)

10. They create an opportunity to guess clothing stains.
 9. It's an economy car, stupid. &quot;Hey, can I borrow $20 for parts?&quot;
 8. The extra time that you get to develop a quality family and spiritual life.
 7. Knowing the UPS drivers by their middle names.
 6. Impressing the neighbors with your driveway and backyard!
 5. How else are ya gonna get to watch an engine fire?
 4. Instant popularity with fifteen year olds, thieves, tailgaters, and rich
    Japanese.
 3. Dependability, &quot;Hey, if you're not doing anything right now, would you 
    run me down to the parts store?&quot;
 2. The level of comfort when the weather is 122 degrees Phoenix and minus 60 
    in Duluth.
 1. The safe feeling I get when I'm around semitrailers on the &quot;Grapevine.&quot;
