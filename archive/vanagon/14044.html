&gt; I'm very sorry to hear what happened to your engine.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;problem is the motor has no crossmember holes.  I know I heard some people 
&gt; &gt;talking about some adapter or some such thing, has anyone ever really used 
&gt; &gt;one of these things for a long period of time?   
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Those things look pretty cheesy to me.  The whole motor hangs from the oil
&gt; pump cover studs.  And those studs are tiny!
&gt; 

    Yeah they may be cheesy and crude but I used one of 
these oil pump adapter plates from Bugpack when I was in a 
similiar situation and it worked flawlessly for 3 years 
before I got around to rebuilding an engine using the 
original case with crossmember holes. Just my experience.
