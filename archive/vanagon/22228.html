Subject: Cooling System Light

I have an '84 Vanagon.  For the first 5 or 10 minutes when it is running,
the red light alerting me to a problem with the cooling system blinks until
the temperature gauge needle moves to where it normally stays when driving.
There is plenty of coolant in the system and it seems to work fine.  It is
just that the light blinks until the coolant in the system reaches it
normal operating temperature and then it stops.  Does anyone know what is
going on and how to stop this annoying blinking without disenabling the
warning light altogether?
