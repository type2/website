Hi folks,
Thanks to all of you that emailed me suggestions for 
getting the rear hatch struts for our '80 Westy.
The dealer in State College, PA, wanted $140 for a pair.

I finally got them from Courtesy Auto Service (608)-244-8088
for $35 a piece (50% less than dealer!!!). These people are
also knowledgeable and helpful (unlike said dealer)
