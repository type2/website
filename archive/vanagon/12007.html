&gt;This is where my van was born,
&gt;But I've had a lot of problems with these butchers over the years.
&gt;They sometimes do good work if you're watching them and offering 
&gt;suggestions.


I talked to them a couple of months ago looking for a hitch for a Syncro, no 
listing for the above hitch, best they have was 1200 or 1500 lbs he thought. 
I too had much trouble with this place when I lived in TO. VWoC rec'd them 
to boot! All warranty work, thank god.   tim s.
