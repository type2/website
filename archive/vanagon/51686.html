&gt; What you hear is correct. I bought a Syncro in Colorado last Spring.

Did you pay Colorado sales tax when you originally purchased the vehicle ?
I know I paid sales tax to Nebraska when I purchased my VW in Nebraska,
then again paid a &quot;sales tax&quot; to California when I started the process of
registering the VW here. What's the scoop with California making me pay a
&quot;sales&quot; tax when I didn't purchase it ? It's illegal to sell a vehicle and
not pay sales tax, so why isn't it illegal for the state to charge me a
sales tax when a sale did not occur ?

They are already milking me for $300 (&quot;pollution&quot; import fee),
regardless of the fact that they may or may not allow me to
register my VW.
