&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Oil leaking into your combustion chamber from the heads, probably around
&gt;&gt;the valve guides. 
&gt;
&gt;Please elucidate, Wolf, as to what the cure would be to stop 
&gt;said leakage around the valve guides.  Replace?  $$?
&gt;Danke.   --Ralf  (btw, apropo of nothing, but my name too is 
&gt;derived from 'wolf')

Hey Wolf MacGrady!

If it is your valve guides, I'd replace the cylinder heads if your beast is
of the air-cooled variety of VW Bus.

But again -

&gt;&gt; How much oil do you go through?  One quart every 1000
&gt;&gt;miles? 500 miles? 250 miles?

Ralf
