Subject: bus-buying checklist?
Date: Sun, 10 Dec 1995 18:20:39 EST

Hey all,
	I don't know if this has been tried before (I didn't see one on
	the ftp site) but how about if the most experienced listmembers
	got together and created a checklist of things to go over when
	looking at a bus.  I know something like this would be really
	handy to me when I get around to buying one.  This checklist
	could include problem areas, how to identify whether or not to
	buy the bus, what kinds of problems should you say no to,
	things like that.  This could be a supplement to the Old Bus
	Recovery Squad (local 201 ;) ) or could be for those folks who
	don't live near any OBRS members.  I couldn't be of much help in
	designing this list as I don't own a bus but I think it would be
	very helpful.  This list could then be posted on the ftp site so
	that those who need it can download it and print it out to take
	with them.  Ideas?  Feedback?

	Sean
