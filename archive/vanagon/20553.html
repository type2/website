&gt;
&gt;Gentle People (and Ric...)
&gt;
&gt;My wife and I are having a marital dispute, and it involves her front
&gt;window in NuBus ('82 Bunker Consumer)...
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that I will not let her roll-down the window, and the
&gt;reason is that when she does, the window &quot;disconnects&quot; from the
&gt;regulator, and falls down into the door.  
&gt;
&gt;This happens because the small square (~1 inch x 1.5 inch) plastic
&gt;piece that attaches the window bracket to the &quot;up-Down&quot; action of the
&gt;regulator is broken. When it disconnects, I have to take the door
&gt;apart to temporarily re-connect the window to the regulator.
&gt;
&gt;My first solution was to remove the crank-handle from her window. She 
&gt;now cannot roll the window down, and the problem seemed to be solved :-)...
&gt;
&gt;Now, Kelly is whining about it being 'hot', and she wants to open the 
&gt;window. When I looked at the fiche for the part, the only part is the
&gt;entire regulator. I JUST NEED A 25 CENT PLASTIC PIECE!!
&gt;
&gt;So, if anybody has this small plastic piece from an old Vanagon regulator,
&gt;I will gladly offer a trade....A fine Convex Computer hat or coffee mug
&gt;in exchange. The hat is black, and does not show the grease, which makes
&gt;it a perfect addition to the bus-owners wardrobe. 
&gt;
&gt;Humbly,

I have the same problem on my '82 Diesel Vanagon, but not as bad.  I can roll
the window down and up without any problem, but I can't close the door with
the window down - it will drop all the way down into the door.  I've trace
the problem to the nylon (?) square you mentioned.  
I've been thinking of devising a way to bind the window frame to the verticle
track without impeding the operation of the window.
I'll let you know if I come up with anything.
