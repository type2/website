There are.  My '87 fuel-injected, computer-brained Mustang has gone under
the wrench several times, and never to replace something that broke.  I
modify it so it will turn faster and accelerate harder at the track.
Definately something I do for fun.  Of course, there's a whole 'nother
mailing list that I subscribe to just for this purpose.  There are a lot of
parallels to this list, including a pretty strong community spirit.

I don't think the list splitting will be the end of the vanagon_at_lenti
community, but if it were my choice I would leave it as a single list, and
those people who cannot or will not learn how to effectively handle their
e-mail can leave.  Boy do I sound grumpy today or what?  :-)

&gt;Maybe the Splitting of the List is the End of History as far as hobbyist
&gt;cars.  From here on the cars-with-points last forever, until their owners
&gt;sand them to death prepping them for their 10th repaint.  The cars-with-
&gt;Hall-Effect remain as appliances, their enthusiast owners reduced to
&gt;debating round vs square headlights and how high to lift which end to
&gt;bleed the radiator.

I sure hope not...
