Joel,

&gt; that coolant stays hot for at least 4 hours and isn't
&gt; very comfortable on your skin when it's hot. :)


Like when the pressure valve doesn't release and when you take it off the 
boiling coolant gushes up on your shirt?  Been there.  Done that.  Leaves 
very nasty blisters and makes you sleep on your back for a while.  
Hugging is done in the manner of Will's wife.
