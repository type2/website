Subject: Re: Looking for a bus

Andrea;
I can't help you in finding a bus but FYI I recently bought a 77 bus with
190K miles and solid body for $1625 (US). I then put another $1000 to1625
replace cylinders, pistons, rings, and heads, plus minor asthetic improve-
ments. So I have a sound van-- mechanically and physically-- for around
$3000. It is a camper and I expect it to last for many years.any r
Anyway, I'd suggest buying a van with 100-150k miles. Otherwise you might
be needing repairs during your travels. Have a mechanic check it before
buying.
Good Luck
