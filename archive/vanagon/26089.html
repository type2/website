90 day warranty??  Nice to see a company that really stands
behind their products!  Sorry for the sarcasm, they're probably GREAT
lights but I'm just hacked off about shitty warranty periods as of
late.  We've had a few things die just after very short
warranty periods lately.   Of course, buying into the extended
warranty scam isn't much of an option either.  Is it just me?  Is anyone
else outraged at quality and the way warranties work these days?
I mean... ..... yes nurse.... I'm coming.....  ;-D
