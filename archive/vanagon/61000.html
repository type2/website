before I forget,

Looked at it again over lunch.  Geez this thing looks nice.  ('91 Corrado,
54,000 miles - RED, very RED)

The battery problems (electric seat belt/trunk light) doesn't seem to be
there, 2 days later and battery still up, with keys in it.  The sunroof does
not open back though.

I'm looking at the air pipe under the battery, and it seems to be plastic.  So
no corrosion.  The intercooler under the fender, seems to be in good shape
also, at least what I can see bending down on my left knee.  (oops, there I go
again, referencing Peter Egan)

I'm convinced that I'm listening to air intake noise, not g-ladder
wheeze/whine.  I only reved it to maybe 2500 as I listened under the hood, but
it doesn't seem to be gone/going.
 
So I'm going to let it sit for a bit.  The SO really does need 4 door, and
couldn't care less about how it handles.  When we got back from a test drive
in &quot;any Passat&quot; for comparrison, she said:  &quot;I want a 4 door Corrodo, in that
nice blue color of the Passat.&quot;  (my appologies to any female listee's, but we
all did get a good laugh)

Thanks to all for the ear full on Corrado's.  I'm going to search for a few
parts for the thing, tell the dealer $3500 (he won't take it - yet) and in the
mean time see if I can find a GLI jetta or nice V6 Passat for lots less than
it's worth.  Of course that means convincing the SO that a Jetta/Passat really
is a small car, and I'll have to move some stuff in the garage to make room
for the extra foot of car, and..........(read this months R&amp;T Miscelaneous
Ramblings)

Maybe when the Dealer gets tired of it taking up space upstairs he'll let it
go.
