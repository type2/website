I would think that for $250 almost anything is worth it.  Think about the 
parts that could be scavenged off if the thing rusts away from underneath 
you.  Price out things like window glass, engine components, trim pieces, 
interior panels....IMHO anything that has things you can use for later on 
other rides should be considered as a sum of those parts.  That is one of 
the beautiful things about VW's.
