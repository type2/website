Subject: Re: More on Westy Interior changes, '68-'72

Joe:

I happen to have a Westy manual for 1967 Campmobile's :):). It is a
photocopy, and is not 100% complete but it is a completists wet dream. tell
you what joe;, you send me a copy of your 68-72 manual, and i'll send you
one of my 67' is it a deal?


&gt;I have a real treasure: and official Campmobile Parts Catalog for
&gt;'68-'72, with exploded drawings of _every_ Westy-specific part.
&gt;AHAHAHAHA snurk! snurk! ... excuse me.  But it _is_ a completist's wet dream.
&gt;
&gt;Anyhoo, some notable changes (doing this sans book, now):
&gt;
&gt;The rear overhead cargo net became an open-fronted cabinet around '70.
&gt;No changes to clothes cabinet or rear seat in that period.  Jumpseat
&gt;(behind driver) saw minor changes.  About '71 the sink got a vent pipe.
&gt;Somewhere about 70=71 the sink became stainless (was plastic).  The
&gt;brace for the sink lid (when open) was eliminated in favor of offset
&gt;hinges.  About the same time the knife drawer was discontinued in favor of a
&gt;drop-down door into the entire undersink area.  Minor changes to the
&gt;racks in the cooler.  The outside socket went through several versions.
&gt;The poptop and folding cot remained unchanged.
&gt;
&gt;IMHO the most difficult parts to find for this series:
&gt;-Faucet that works (and hasn't lost its discharge pipe)
&gt;-Uncracked plastic sink
&gt;-Table that latches properly in the stored position.
&gt;-Hammock, if it was misplaced -- especially the blue end-cover.
&gt;-Stool, with leather strap for attaching to side of sink cabinet.
&gt;-Cooler trays.
&gt;-plastic trim that encircles sunroof cutout in bus body
&gt;
&gt;The book includes all part numbers, inluding those for the tent.  Nice
&gt;sketches. No, you can't have it, it's mine.  Happy to provide details &amp;
&gt;P/Ns on request -- this would be KILLER if it was for pre-67's.
&gt;
&gt;God, I have simple tastes.
&gt;
&gt;Jose
&gt;
&gt;PS I like the Westy book idea -- I've already written most of the tent
&gt;chapter (plug, plug -- see .sig :-).  I confess my faves are pre-74, though
&gt;the newer ones certainly are more _civilized_, a fact I grow increasingly
&gt;appreciative of as I age, gracelessly.
