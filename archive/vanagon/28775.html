&gt; The last big noisemaker I have to take care of is the solid tranny mount.
&gt; Anyone have any eperience with an early mount conversion piece that wasn't
&gt; solid?  I'm thinking about buying one and modifying it, cutting a slice out
&gt; of it an putting in a piece of rubber instead...
&gt; 
I've had a couple of pre-60 buses that used the original type mount with 
a tunnelcase TII swingaxle tranny &amp; nose cose.  It works, but refrain 
from any abuse as it's just the snout of the nosecone surrounded by the 
original-type rubber mount.  There are some fabrication solutions, but 
I've often wondered if the best solution would be the original type 
mounting method previously mentioned combined with a Gene Berg type 
tranny mount that goes right between the tranny case and the nose cone 
and uses rubber mounts off to the side, IMHO.  8-)
