Subject: Re: cleaning carpets

&gt;Anyone have any tips on cleaning the carpets for an old Vanagon.  Took it to
&gt;one of those coin-op car washes and used their vacuum/ soaper but it left a
&gt;musty (pretty gross) smell.  Is there the &quot;wonder cleaner&quot; out there that I'm
&gt;missing?
&gt;
Hey vargsman, 
     I removed the carpet from the van.  It is an easy operation, first
remove the door sill plate, then remove the wooden panel below the rear
seat.  Fold the rear part of the carpet forward out from under the rear
seat.  pull the parts of the carpet out from under the center seat.  Then
carefully pull the carpet out of the van.  I place the carpet on a clean
surface and used a mild solution of laundry soap to clean it.  Removing it
allows for using alot of water to rinse the dirt and sand out of the fibers.
I use a stiff brush and a sponge mop to work the lather into the carpet.
Once done I let it dry, by hanging it in the sun. 
     This applies to the rear carpet, I haven't had to do any major cleaning
on the fronts.  I beleive they will come out just as easily.
