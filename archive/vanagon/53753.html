I have the same problem. I tried tightening the valve bolts but the leak is
still there (although it's now much less). I'm going to try removing the
heater valve, disassembling it and reassembling it with some sealant. Hope
it works.

Check the connection between the valve and the heat it self. Start
the engine, let it warm up, (under pressure) then put side to side,
on the hose leading to the valve and look for leaks!

&gt; HELP!  I pulled the never-used seat belts up from underneath the rear

&gt; but I'm afraid I might not be able to find it in the archives.  Can 
&gt; someone shed some light on what needs to be done?
