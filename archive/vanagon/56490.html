Subject: Lighter tyres for lighter steering?
Date: Tue, 25 Feb 1997 22:31:46 -0000

My 1982 aircooled bus used to have such light steering that people thought
it had power. Now the steering on my 1984 Caravelle GL is a fair effort.
This tyre talk makes me wonder whether changing the tyres may lighten the
steering. Is this true? My tyres say: 185 R14 C, 102/100, 65 psi max, max
single load 1873 lbs. Label says Southern. The other front one says almost
the same thing except label is Firestone, load is 1875 lbs and it also says
P 8 PR. I wonder where I can find out what all this means.

1. Can I change to a lighter tyre or a better brand?
2. With a max of 65 psi, can I pump up a bit higher - I've got it on about
42 at the moment? The handbook says 35 front and 47 rear, the door sticker
says 36 front and 48 rear. I would never be taking the tyres to anywhere
near their limits of load, acceleration or speed.
