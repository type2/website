Subject: Name the plate for the '67 RFH Contest

The vanity plates for vehicles in the State of Arizona are composed of a
white feild with green lettering that is a dead ringer for velvet green. The
background has a unobrusive desert sunset. They look OK. &quot;Cherry&quot; and Rusty
VanBondo cant decide what if any msg to run on the plate. They all seem too
&quot;Cutesy.&quot; 
Please send *private* suggestions of what the license plate on the 1967
Westy &quot;Resto from Hell&quot; oughta say. Limited to six alpha-numeric characters
in AZ.
If I'm still employed next Friday I will post one message then. Let's not
clog the list publically. Thanks!
=======================================
BTW: &quot;RUSTY&quot; doesn't seem to be in the running for a bus that is devoid of
the stuff and is already taken in Arizona.
=======================================
Suggestions:
1. - Arizona antique plate made out of real copper with red lettering. (No
vanity message)
2. - 67 RFH  ?   ;-)
3. - 67 SO42 ?
