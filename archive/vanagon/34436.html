Subject: steering frozen!!!

tried to turn the wheel in the mornig on the 66, but it inly turned in one
direction.  It has not got much above freezing the past week or so.  I put
the halogen work light under the bus shing on the steering box, and after a
while lo and behold, it turned!

This is the same bus that had water and gook in the trans from sitting in the
low part of a field that flooded last winter.  a tiny light shone in my brain
- water in the steering box hm.....

now that the water is drained out and replaced with gear oil, it works a lot
better.

I think it will be standard operating procedure from now on to change the
steering gear oil on a new bus, along with  trans oil, check boots, and
usually a complete brake rebuild.

btw, the trans works great, feels tight and shift easy.  The gear oil has
been changed a second time.
