Subject: more on showers


More on that sprayer shower.  What about finding a dedicated non
previously used metal sprayer, that has it's own metal tank, so
that you could just put the tank itself over a propane stove to
heat it.  Maybe it could even have its own temperature indicator
on the outside?
