&gt;Stephen,
&gt;I had a similar noise coming form my speedo area.  At first I thought
&gt;that it was the cable but I was wrong.  When I disconnected it from the
&gt;speedometer unit it was silent.  I found that the speedo gauge was making
&gt;the noise.  Not having the money to buy a new unit I went to work on
&gt;pulling the old one apart to fix it.  I found the noise went away when I
&gt;sprayed a little WD40 on the magnet that is rotated by the cable in the
&gt;gauge unit.  As you look at the back of the gauge you'll see where the
&gt;speedometer connects.  A little off-center from that you'll see another
&gt;area were you might be able to spray some lube through.  I say &quot;might&quot;
&gt;because I pulled the whole speedometer out of the console and then went
&gt;to work on it.  You may have to do this also.  The only negative affect
&gt;this had was now the needle on the gauge shakes a little bit at lower
&gt;speeds.  Other than that it makes no noise and I who knows how much money
&gt;I saved.  I'll pray for you on your adventure.

I have the ALLDATA CD for the Vanagon, and there is a service advisory on
the speedo cable noise. Seems that they made a change to the speedo itself
at some point by adding a graphite impregnated ring (where the cable plugs
in?) Anyway the old speedos have a white ring and the corrected ones have a
grey one. There was also a change made in the cable itself at some point.
I have the CD at work so I can't look it up verbatum at this moment.
