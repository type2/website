Subject: Microbus replacements

I have Delux 21 windows Micro bus walk thur with ragtop. The nose and doors 
are badly smashed so I would like to know is it possible to use kombi bus 
doors and nose to replace the microbus? I noticed that the dashboard of 
microbus has more features than the other bus. What year will it fit 
to replace the nose and the door for the '65 microbus? Anyone out there 
sells the nose also doors for the microbus.
