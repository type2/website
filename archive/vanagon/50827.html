Subject: Re: Bilstein Shocks for $69

In a message dated 96-10-14 20:18:55 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Ed Berroth suggested a call to Mark Anderson at ASI in San Diego regarding
 the shocks for $50 deal. I called Mark and he said that those shocks are
only
 for certain pickups but that he would give me a good deal because I know Ed.
 So I bought a set of shocks for $69 each plus $14 to drop ship all 4 to
 Vermont. Mark's business is suspensions for all cars including race cars and
 he seems like a very friendly guy. He has an 800 number for previous
 customers and suggested I post it. 
 800-683-2890. Bilstein makes one shock for all Vanagons.
 
 Thanks for the info Ed.

Im glad to help you guys out.I was in the business for many years and have
many wholesale connections nationwide.Some I can just refer you all to...some
I have to order myself.If anybody has a big order or group thing lewt me
know...I usually beat any price out there as i get a wholsalers break.Mark's
a great guy who has intimate contact w/ Bilstein.....I helped Cleve at
Bilstein develop the rear shocks for XJ Jaguars in the  mid80s so I usually
can get anything I want...even if it is not imported in US...Mark/Cleve will
get it for me.Feel free to call him and let him know I referred you guys to
him.I usually get around 40% off standard Bilstein list for most
applications.The truck shocks are 50 bucks for most truck/suv applications
and are a sweet deal(bilstein has had this price for 3 yrs. to compete
w/kyb,monroe,rancho etc.)If anyone out there has a truck...avail yourself of
this deal.SDee Ya.
