&gt; another weirder answer to the missing brake fluid could be that the BRAKE
&gt; master is leaking into the booster, hence the dissapearing fluid.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone???

This happened to me on my '71. Evidently the front of the master
cylinder leaked into the booster.  All was ok for awhile, then
the engine would die when I stepped on the brake. Seems the
brake fluid ate through the diaphragm, creating a massive vacuum
leak when the brake was applied.......NOT CHEAP!
