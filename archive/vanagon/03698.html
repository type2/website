&gt; &gt; Hi California people,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Come to think of it, I'm interested in anything California for my Cal theme
&gt; &gt; Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to go that route, you should get those chrome headlight shades,
&gt; Porsche wheels, wide tires (oops, tyres), and lower the bus a coupla
&gt; inches.  Naaaahhhh...

and don't forget a big dent in the side with the word &quot;OUCH!!&quot; 
written in the dent useing the local language.

it gives it that &quot;realy been to california and barely survived&quot; look.
