Subject: Sliding window screens

Hey,

The '87 Vanagon I just bought has the sliding window on the sliding door 
and at the same location on the driver's side.  My question is how do I 
put screens (factory or otherwise) to protect me from flying critters at 
night when I want a nice breeze at night.

I would also like to know if any company out there makes a front and or 
rear black tube bumper for the Vanagon.  I saw a Vanagon with one and it 
looked SHARP.  He had a shop weld one up for him but it was very 
expensive.  I've asked around in LA, CA and they want around $3-400 a 
bumper!!!   HELP!

Thank you everyone for your replies to my earlier posts.

Perry
