Subject: Re: Front CV (Black and) Blues


from Derek Drew....

&gt;an you advise us as to whether to try to go for the special CV boots that
&gt;you have. Did you choose these? Is there an advantage to these over whatever
&gt;it is you would get from VW? 
&gt;

Sorry, my van came with the poly boots on it, only on front outer CVs! All 
others look stock and original, ie. cracks appearing everywhere so I'll be 
busy this summer too. I see the poly boots advertised heavily for 
dunebuggies off-roading, and for steering rack bellows, dirtbikes front 
shock covers, but I've no real 'data'. Maybe they're cheaper? Probably less 
susceptible to sun/UV damage (lots of that under the van!) They do feel 
tougher/stiffer, more puncture resistant? The sales weasel made a point of 
showing me the poly boots when I was inspecting.... does this mean anything? 
Hah. 

        BTW: 1)what have you people busted/bent on the underside of your 
Syncro while off-roading, if anything?
             2) what is the standard size Syncro (steel) rim 5.5 OR 6.0 x 
14, I'm a bit peeved I have 5.5 wide rims, and the dealer wants 
$191.00Cdn/rim for 6.0 size!

thanks all,       tim s.
