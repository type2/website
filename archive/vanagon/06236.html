&gt;Maybe I'll sit out  the next storm in it and watch for dripping:-)

nah. get out the garden hose and let some helper spray water all over the
front of the car ... with you inside, of course.

my 80 started leaking the first week i got it ... windshield rubber seal
right in the lower left corner ... if you watched, you could see the small
drip-stream coming in and down behind the fuse box. !!?! that was something
i got fixed in a hurry. :) all it took was some 3M Heavy Duty Drip Check
goop (in a big tube): stick the nozzle of the tube up under the edge of the
windshield seal and squeeze a bead of goop all around the windshield ...
might was well catch any other potential leaks while you're at it. get some
General Purpose Adhesive Remover for cleaning up ... if you get the goop
too thick, it'll ooze out from under the seal.  (all this is on the OUTSIDE
of the car, by the way. :)

another place you might want to look is the bottom of the vent windows.
sometimes the rubber pulls away from the pivot at the bottom, and a little
leak can form there. i've used black silicon seal to stop those leaks.
(didn't take very much at all).

hope it helps.
