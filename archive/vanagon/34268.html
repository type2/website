Subject: Re: '70 Bus - Is this a good deal???

Hi - thanks for the replies...

	Well, I checked out the '70 yesterday. The seller was out of town so 
I just looked around a little. Not to much, didn't want to make the 
neighbours suspicious. Guess what? - It has rust. A lot of little 
stuff on the edges of doors and gutters etc. But the worst was a hole 
rusted through just below the bottom of the windshield seal on the 
driver's side.  I hate rust! Rust is evil!

	The steering box looked pretty oily, maybe its leaking. Couldn't 
tell much from the engine ie. nothing obvious. The sliding door hinge 
doesn't latch. There is some kind of wire arraignment keeping it 
closed.  $2,000? Hah!! I don't think so. I may still go drive it and 
see. 

	But I may not. Today I looked at a '71. Here's the scoop: This is
an engine from one bus in the body of another. The body has 57K
miles. Don't know about the engine yet bet I'll find out. It's a VW
repair shop that did the work and is selling it. Good tight steering,
good brakes and clutch. The motor looked fairly clean, not a lot of
oil around, but it needs a new rubber  seal. I didn't see any sign
of brake fluid on the wheels. The mechanics of it seem ok (though I'm 
far from expert). The body has a few small dings and there is some 
rust in a few spots. The worst part is the battery tray - rusted 
through.   They're asking $1,800.00

	How does this one sound? Is repairing that battery tray an expensive 
job? Any other things you think I should check?  

	Again I really appreciate you help!
