Subject: Timing

I am the proud (but frustrated) new owner of an '80 Westfalia.  I'm really
happy and excited about it.  While I'm not expert mechanic everything looks
and runs great and I hope to do most or all maintenance and repairs myself.
 However, in looking things over I'm confused by not being able to find any
type of notch on the crankshaft pulley to line up with the scale for timing,
etc.  The front edge of the pulley is kinda rounded and I can't find any
other type of marking.  Am I blind or what?  
Also, any ideas on why my dash battery and EGR lights stay on at start-up
until I tap the gas?  
Any help is greatly appreciated.
