Subject:      EV Had to be towed.....

EV'ers:


       My 93 MV just died on me in a line at Wendy's and wouldn't restart
and had to be towed to the dealership. It doesn't seem that any gas is
reaching the engine because I couldn't smell any. Starter motor is working
fine. It will be Monday before anyone there can look at it so....

       How about a little &quot;Car Talk&quot; quiz?  What wrong with my baby? Could
it be the exhaust at Wendy's? The winner gets a Wendy's sandwich on their
next visit to Providence. Has anyone out there had a similar problem??
