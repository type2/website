I think that the discovery channel was overdoing it with the covering of 
their asses.  They probably had to say that so that no one could sue them.
I've done hundreds of both on and off car wheel balances, and never 
seen a tyre climb off the rim.  :)
With the tyre inflated there is so much static friction along the bead
that even V8s in stump puller gears can't spin the rim in the tyre.

I think the only real danger here is the spinning tyre releasing pebbles 
from it's tread at great velocities and putting out someone's eye.
I've seen pebbles fly during an on car balance, but never tyres.

I'm not saying that you're wrong, Mantis, (and you're going to leave him
alone, Ric.) but I think that the Discovery channel misled you.
