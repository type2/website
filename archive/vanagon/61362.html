&gt;My wife and I are having a big outdoor party at our house this Saturday. 
&gt;Dogs &amp; burgers on the grill, a couple of kegs, and at least one or two
&gt;Westies staying over Saturday night (along with their owners).    Starts
&gt;around 3 pm Saturday, and goes on late into the night (and maybe starts
&gt;again the next morning depending on how many stay over :)
