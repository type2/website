Sorry it took so long to respond...

&gt; 	I bought my 84 about 5 months ago...I don't know much, but maybe
&gt; 	we can help each other out...?

Absolutely!  And by the looks of your phone number, you are in the little 
five points area--I'm in Midtown, not far away.  I'll try to get in 
touch with you when I get back into town after Thanksgiving--I'm taking 
a raod trip up the East Coast, alas in the Passat--don't think I trust 
the Transporter to that point yet.

Maybe we can hit the junk yards together!

Regards. --

And all the puppets in this digital jail / They're runnin' around in a frenzy
In search of the Holy Grail. /
They're havin' virtual sex. / They're eatin' virtual food.
No wonder these puppets are always in a lousy mood.
