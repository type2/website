Subject: bash lost &amp; found


I have piles of food, drink, and clothes left over from the bash
this past weekend.  If anyone is missing anything (if you're sober
enough to have discovered that yet, that is), and if you want it
back, let me know!  :)

Thanks to everyone for all the terrific food and cooking and
company.  Hope you all got some sleep!
