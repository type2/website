&gt; As to Michelin performance tires the H20 FAQ and
&gt; I agree with someones statement, utter crap on the
&gt; wet, this includes the MXX and all iterations of the
&gt; MXV used often on Accords.  However for FWD and 4WD
&gt; on the Quantum I loved the XGT H4, agressive all
&gt; season and held like a bear, alas not available in
&gt; 50 series sizes for the Corrado but H rated and would
&gt; probably fit a Van but the standard question, is that
&gt; H rated sidewall as stiff as a C load range tire?

Dunno about the general case, but as I noted in the Safare &quot;tire
report&quot; I posted recently, the tires I ended up with (205-75HR14)
had significantly stiffer sidewalls than any of the other tires I
looked at, which included several &quot;load range C&quot; types of 6-ply, and
even one 8-ply tire.  I am extremely happy with them!  They handle
the weight of my bus mucho better, and I have some serious weight on them
(like three batteries, two beds, lots of tools, firewood, refrigerator,
propane tank, and on and on).  They are an off brand I have never
heard of - made in Indonesia, guaranteed for 40k miles.
