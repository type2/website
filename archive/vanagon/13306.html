&gt;major snip&lt;

&gt;&gt;If y'all had $30,000 to spend, what camper would get get?  A late-model
&gt;&gt;syncro?  A late-model non-syncro?  An earlier camper? Or should I wait?
&gt;&gt;........................................................................

If I had $30,000 I'd squirel hole about $20,000-25,000 and hunt for a
bitchen DohrMobile.(spelling?)
We saw one last summer that someone snagged for cheap that had sumpin' like
45,000 orginal miles on it. It was beautiful!!! The owners were pretty nice
to boot. Although that bus was the extreme exception (price and miles) it
was cool. Keep in mind that I've been (am) going through restoration hell on
a '67 Westy and my daily driver is an '83 Vanagon Westy-Moby (the whale)
Campmobile. My choice would still be a DohrMobile. If you want the ultimate
museum piece start praying for a '51 deluxe, I wouldn't care how often I got
the finger while going uphill!!
