Subject: Rain in your Vanagon

    To all Vanagon owner:
    Subject: Water Leaks A MUST TO STOP RUST!
       
       This is something I have not seen discussed yet. I have seen
       several Vanagons with water leaks in the same spots. The first                                         
       is around the from windsheild. Hard to notice leak, you will
       find a small amount of water on one or both sides of the front
       floor. This water can  easily be misstaken for water from your
       feet getting into the vehicle in wet weather. If you look under
       the flooring (carpet and 1/2&quot; thick sound insulation) you may
       find a lot more water. The fix is cheap and easy. On a dry day
       use a air gun around the entire outside windshield seal, 
       between rubber and glass, and then between the rubber and body, 
       until you see no more water or dirt coming out. Then use clear
       silicone seal from a caulking gun around the hole window. Force 
       the tip of the gun under the entire rubber outside edges. 
       You may need to stop on the outer
       corners to fill up larger gaps. Spend the time needed to clean
       up. This stuff makes a mess. The second leak I have seem is a
       vertical body seam on drivers side, between quarter and middle 
       panel. Once again by removing the flooring and finding water 
       in the bay area, you can be tell if you have this water leak. 
       To fix this, remove the driver side inner panel. This leak also 
       means rust. You need to spray a rust inhibiter acid from the 
       inside out. Force it into the seam with a air gun. Then clean 
       any of the acid that may have made it's way to the outside, off 
       your paint. Once dry use a good paint on the inside. This is 
       usually enough to stop this leak. If you use your van for camping
       this is a great time for insulating.

Greetings! Any Vanagonites (or otherwise) had experience with rainwater
leaking from behind dash?
After about 24 hours of driving rain, there were slow drips on both the
passenger and driver side (91 Vanagon) onto the floormats. I felt around as
best I could from below: very damp, unable to locate source. windshield seal
seems intact. Any ideas?
