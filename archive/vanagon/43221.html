I don't think the problem is too low gearing, in fact I bet the G60 motor 
would love to be running at 3500-4800 rpm. Its more a problem of where 
the max torque and hp comes. If you have to wind out the motor to accel 
the heavy old westy, it becomes a bit tiresome after a while. I think it 
would be more sensible and rewarding to tailor the powerplant to the real 
job at hand, that is a motor with a torque curve that increases early and 
peaks soon. 

G60s are prolly better suited to being dropped into old sciroccos rather 
than vanagons.

I'm just approaching 2 years and about 30,000 miles on my &quot;1800 8v into 
'82 diesel westy&quot; conversion. Still with the original diesel trans, and 
yes, I could use an overdrive 5th gear, but these have been trouble free 
miles and I'm very pleased with the conversion. I still plan on 
installing one of those adjustable cam gears and try and adjust the 
torque curve a wee bit. 

So far I think the Audi 5 cyl conversion (as done by VW SA) is the most 
appealling, but perhaps an increased volume 8v is the easiest and most 
cost effective conversion.
