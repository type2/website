I've heard that the frig will run a couple of weeks if that's all you use
it for...

&gt;
&gt; The Campmobile owners guide that I got from the previous
&gt; owner does not have any mention of how to tell how much propane
&gt; you have left.  I don't see anything that looks like a guage
&gt; anywhere near the tank.  Is there some way to tell how much
&gt; you have or do you just stop at a propane station every so often
&gt; and have them fill it up.
&gt;
&gt; A related question.  Assuming that the temperature is in the
&gt; 70-80 range,  how many days can you run the refrig on a tank
&gt; of propane.  I know there are lots of variables, but just a
&gt; ball park number is fine ( &lt; 2 days, about a week, ...)
