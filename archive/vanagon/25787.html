&gt;Thank you very much Ron. Could you schedule a regular posting to the 
&gt;vanagon list about the Inuvik trip. Perhaps we could get Joel to put it 
&gt;in his stats message?  
&gt;Also, I can put the same message in the welcome file. Just a brief 
&gt;paragraph about the trip and who to contact.

Sounds great.  I'll come up with something and post it monthly.  The Inuvik
mailing list welcome message already tells people how to get onto the
Vanagon mailing list.  (Could you please check this for accuracy?)

Here's my welcome message:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Top of the World Tour mailing list.

This mailing list is for the discussion of topics related to the Fall 1996
trek to Inuvik, in Canada's Northwest Territories.  This is primarily a trip
for Volkswagen busses of all makes and years.

This trip is being organized by members of the Vanagon mailing list.  To
subscribe to this list, send mail to 'listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu'.  The body
of the message should say 'subscribe vanagon your_email_address'.

To send an article to the list, send it to &quot;inuvik_at_chaco_dot_com&quot;.
To subscribe or unsubscribe, send a message to &quot;inuvik-request_at_chaco_dot_com&quot;.
