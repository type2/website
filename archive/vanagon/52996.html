temperature sensors with remotely mounted displays:

&gt; I mounted the unit itself on the dash panel which is just to the left of
the 
&gt;  center air vents. This panel pops off, so it makes an easy place to string

&gt;  the wire for the outside sensor. I strung the wire across the top of the 
&gt;  pedal cluster, and behind the fuse box (you need to drop the fuse panel 
&gt;  cover, and the plate below the fuse box.

I'm planning on getting two of these soon.  One to mount as you did and
another to mount the temperature senso inside my ice box.  This way I can
keep beter track of how cool my food is and when I need to replace the ice.
 Those with real refrigerators might find this useful also.
