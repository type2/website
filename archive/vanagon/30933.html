Considering the coolant leakage problems some have and the length and 
number of coolant hoses used, I would say yes.  

I recently used mine to diagnose pinholes in the upper radiator.  They
were too small to leak enough coolant to notice, but would suck in air
upon cooling after shutoff.  Next trip, coolant is forced out the pressure
cap, leaving a big air bubble in the radiator.  Without the pressure
tester, I would have thought I had a small combustion gas leak into the
cooling system. 

I came across one today for $89 + $30 for VW/Audi adapter. Seems 
&gt; like it could be useful in the long run, but it's quite a bit of $ for such 
&gt; a special purpose thing. 

I don't remember what I paid, but it was pricey.  Useful tool though.

Mike
