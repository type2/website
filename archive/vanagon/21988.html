Subject: Re: Cooling System Flushing

There was some good information about changing coolant at a web site or ftp
site. At least it looked good to me after changing the coolant &quot;by the book&quot;
a few times!  I think it involved installing a &quot;T&quot; under the van near the
front and doing some other special things.

Maybe someone out there knows where to find the report? Otherwise, let me
know--I have in writing and could reproduce it for whomever.
