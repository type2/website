Subject: ride height



	I'm thinking about how to raise my vanagon 1.5 - 2&quot;.
	It seems that the easiest and cheapest way would be
	to replace the pads on which the coil springs rest
	on with thicker (polyurethane?) ones.
	Any suggestions?

	On a different subject, has anybody replaced the 
	waterpump pulley with one of a smaller diameter to
	increase pump rate especially at idle? Probably
	would have to make your own, what with offset,
	shaft size, bolt holes etc.

	ps. this last weekend I went on a trip with the old
	vangon (vanawhite), and I noticed that the fridge, when
	running off gas, periodically made a noise like a fan. I
	assume it is that little white bladed job in back
	beside the fins and tubing. Never noticed it doing
	that before, was it because of the high ambient temp?
	(lovely hot weekend beside a cool river, nobody except
	us and the local wildlife, including fat cutthroat...
	sigh).
