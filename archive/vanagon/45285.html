Subject: A.C. causing van to die

I have a 1985 VW Vanagon Westfalia, we just bought it a month ago, and when I
use the air conditioner the van dies when I come to a stop. Any tips?  Is
this normal due to the small engine and large requirements of the air
conditioner?  I would appreciate any tips!!!!
