Subject: porsche tape

	Folks,
	Regarding the Porsche tape I cast like bread on the waters-
apparently its circulating nicely- not only do I not have the email
address of whomever has it, I don't have the address of whomever
sent it there *either*! :)
	So its clear that asking me for the tape isn't going to get
it to you- its up to the list to come through now!

	So I suggest the following: If you want to see the tape
and haven't already confirmed your name is on the list, I guess you
have to post a request to the list and hope whomever has it responds. 
Kinda like everything else on the list... and I think it'll work fine.

	If you've got the tape, and someone wants to see it, add their
name to the bottom of the list before you pass tape and list along.
