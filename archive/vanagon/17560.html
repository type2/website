Subject: Re: Exhaust System- EGR filter on 82 Westy

Tim,
You do not need the EGR filter for any mechanical or performance reason.
You can remove it or block it off. It may, however, have an effect on
emission testing if that's an issue in your state. The entire exhaust
system on my '81 Westy is kaput and it's unbelievably expensive to replace.
VW doesn't even make the crossover pipe any longer! I've just stuck a JC
Whitney muffler on to the heater boxes until I can figure out an
alternative. I'm sure I won't pass the Texas emission test mwithout the
catalytic converter.
