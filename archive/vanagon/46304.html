Subject: 78 bus won't move -- brakes?

Well, the last time I parked my bus (planning to drive it to
work the next day), I never figured it would sit a month without
being driven, and I set the hand brake.  I went to drive it
last night, and it won't move!  Engine runs, transmission and
clutch seem OK, but letting out the clutch only turns the wheels
a few degrees.  Then it feels like they hit a stop, and the
engine stalls.

I figure the rear brake shoes are rusted to the drums.  Is there
anything else that could possibly be wrong?  It's only been a month--
could brake drums rust solid that quickly?

What should I do to try to correct this problem?  One person here at
work suggested smacking the wheels with a sledge hammer a few times.
If that fails (or I like my wheels undented), pull the wheels, and hit
the brake drums directly.  What do I do if THAT doesn't work?

After I get the brakes free again, do they need any maintainence
because this happened?

Thanks,
Rodney
