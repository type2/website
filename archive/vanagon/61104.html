Subject: Bumper attached to tow hooks

Saw (and took some pictures) of a bumper hooked to the tow hooks on
a Vanagon.  Looked like a slick setup since it looks it could
presumably be removed by taking out 4 bolts.  

Is this a commercial product?  The one that Bus Boys have requires 
drilling into the bumper supports.  I looks like it might be a custom 
job from a weld shop.  I'll put some pictures on my homepage when I 
get them back.

My application would be a light trailer with fiberglass 17' 
Daysailer.
