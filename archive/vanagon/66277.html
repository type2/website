    Use a punch in the hole in the center of the shaft only. If you try
    to use a sock or such on the end chances are you can mushroom the end
    enough to end up cutting it off.
          If you have already done damage find a press.

&gt; Listees,
&gt; I'm trying to replace two of the CV joints and four of the boots on the
&gt; rear axle of my '86 Syncro Westfalia.
&gt; How do I separate the CV joint from the shaft? I have removed the
&gt; circlip and tried both methods of separation: 1) used a drift and hammer
&gt; on the inner part of the CV joint to drive it off of the shaft and 2)
&gt; used a drift and hammer to drive the shaft through the CV joint. I got
&gt; 1/16 inch movement and then nothing more. Should I just persist and
&gt; swear louder? Should I find a hydraulic press? What am I doing wrong?
&gt; Did I miss something?
&gt;
&gt; I'm frustrated and about to give up on this CV joint project. Larry :-(
