&gt;A few syncros with 16&quot; wheels made it to Australia.I have seen a syncro

&gt;back of VW mags here getting air off a jump on a beach.I believe it

&gt;Only possible drawback with 16&quot; wheels is,according to my owner's manual
&gt;you can't fit snow chains as there isn't enough clearance.

Hi there, 

Some of them went to France also. I got one last year. It's called Caravelle
GL turbo diesel in Europe. No problem for snow chains, but you can put them
only on rear wheels according to my owner's manual. And yes there is enough
clearance. Tires are Goodyear Wrangler A/T 205/16. Bye,
