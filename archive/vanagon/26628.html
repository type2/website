Subject: Re: Fridge temps

You need to be measuring the temperature of the *fins* inside the fridge to
really know what is going on in there. On a cool day (e.g., 60 degrees)
these fins can reach 17 degrees F. 

The temperature of the fins will be higher if you do as I recomend in my
article and run a tiny fan across them to blow cold air down onto the food.

&gt;I've gotten to the point of trying to make my Westy fridge more usable. 
&gt;But, I'm not sure whether mine is actually working properly. (I know they 
&gt;are notoriously lousy, but how lousy?)
&gt;
&gt;It would help me if everyone with a stock Westy could post their fridge 
&gt;temps.
&gt;
&gt;Specifically, what temp would the fridge interior be on a 90 degree day?
&gt;
&gt;How cold can you get the fridge interior (at maximum cold)? At what 
&gt;outide temp?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a bunch!
