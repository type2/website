&gt; 
&gt; But right now i need to get at my back brakes.  Muir says just take the
&gt; wheel off, remove the 2 little bolts and pull the drum off and look at the
&gt; brakes.  My drums wouldn't pull off.  It seemed so simple, but i should
&gt; have known there was some sort of catch.  Can someone give me some hints?
&gt; 

Be sure to back off the brake shoes as far as you can and make damn sure
the parking brake is released.
