Subject: Let's make this large list EASIER ! !


ALERT: nearly 100 posts a day is too much to cope with- PLEASE let's set up
some common rules- the straw that broke my back was the query on 60's bus
timing posted under subject heading about that trip with the blown engine!
I  (as an air-cooled enthusiast) propose the following rules for this list
please feed back better suggestions or please comply!!

***. Some mail readers can SORT e-mail based on key-words-choice of subject
line, first line, or whole message body...ie being on multiple lists
necessitates sorting by the list return address in my case.
***This can be further refined by sorting out keywords placed IN SUBJECT
HEADING or at least first line, so I can create folders separately holding
air-cooled specific queries/comments from general stuff like trip reports
and show notices.  Suggestions are:
 1. WC - water cooled specific- just putting &quot;87 Westy in subj helps those
perusing by eye, but makes it difficult to set up smart sweeps!
2. AC -air-cooled...
3. FS AC PA ...any posts on stuff/vehicles for sale!  This includes the
farmer with the bus to get rid of out in a field. PLEASE INCLUDE STATE
(like PA) and AC or WC in subject heading or first line!!  I waste a lot of
time drooling to find out it's more than two days away!!!
4. WANTED - (cant think of short name)- if you need something like part,
manual, address for parts place, new bus, etc. -Want Camping partner?-
place under TRIP?..
5. TRIP-FLA  - trip report, experiences with bus, include STATE or REGION
please!  If something broke down or a wierd symptom appeared and you want
feedback, post separate HELP message, please!
6. TRIP? -FLA - if you are organizing or reporting on a caravan getogether
or want info on an area-please post this first in subj. line-the ? lets us
know you are commenting on UPCOMING trip!  Those of us in NJ may ignore this!.....
7. SHOW-MN - report on show you went to.  SHOW? = upcoming show annc., or
query on any who want to go?  INCLUDE STATE please!
8. HELP- (followed by specifier, like &quot; HELP-WC- water pump bad?&quot; Lets me
ignore it or leave it in &quot;incoming mail&quot; folder for deletion!  HELP-BODY-
lets me know it's a restoration query!
- I hate posts that use ENGINE RUNS ROUGH... how about HELP-WC-87diesel,
runs rough, OR - lets us know whether we are near you, have similar
vehicle, etc!
***some true guru experts out there I know shy away from e-mail lists
***because of time spent, and we are losing their expertise- so if you have
***a technical query on repair, or posting a SYMPTOM put HELP in subject
***line!!!! For help on best tires to get, WANTED may be better place....
-----
The there's the other stuff, like catalog announcments, new members, etc.a
clear subject heading helps.

PLEASE CHANGE SUBJECT if &quot;reply&quot; to post changes original subject intent!!

-Anyone able to set up separate AC list?  I like this better than the AC
newsgroup, which requires all that logging on stuff.  MB in NJ (AC forever)
