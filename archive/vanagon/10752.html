Here is what I got from the horse's mouth.  Same thing Jon Christensen 
had to say.  Thought I would pass it along.  It's Freaky Friday, 
afterall.

You will be shocked and saddened to hear this, but I cannot think of 
any relationship between Kerouac and VW buses.  I have read nearly all of his
books and I cannot think of a single time that he ever rode in one or 
talked about one.  I am probably forgetting some huge thing, but I 
don't think so.  He talks about beat-up cars and riding Greyhound and 
pick-ups once or twice, and even a hay rack.  He no doubt would have 
like to ride in a VW and maybe even had one at one time in real life, 
but I just can't remember an episode where he wrote about one.  Sorry.
It seems like he mostly rode in beat up old sedans, or workman's 
pickups.  
Now there may be some kind of symbolic or mystic connection between 
the spirit of VWism and Kerouacism.  That would be something we would 
need some kind of &quot;controlled substance&quot; to discuss and fully 
understand.  Maybe somebody on rec.music.gdead would be able to give 
us a clue.  
The only other Kerouac related bus thing I can think of is Ken Kesey's 
psychadelic bus trips in the late 60's.  Kerouac went on a few of 
those trips, but was mostly drunken and crabby the whole time.
Not much help  rob
