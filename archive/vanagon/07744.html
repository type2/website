Hey Kurt, I have a 78 as well, which pieces did you order for the matchup
to the heater boxes? Some have a square twohole end and some like mine 
have a triangular one hole end. Their descriptions don't match the triangle
shaped ones like I have for my year. The 78 appears to be the square 2hole
design. What gives?
