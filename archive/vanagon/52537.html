Subject: FS: 97 (?) Vanagon Campers

I was going through some old bookmarks today and found an ad for a 1997
Vanagon Camper. They are conversions by Country Homes out of San Jose,
California. I don't know how they could be 1997 but they are very nice
setups anyway. Does anybody know anything else about these? Check them
out at:
