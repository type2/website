Subject: The stranded young lady

  As the title says, there she was in a very rough looking westfalia
 '68 or so. I saw it going south in Grants Pass in the North bound 
 lane. I had worked all day on this engine and my kindness milk was 
 kind of thin. 
  
  I picked up a can of primer at Walmart and grabbed a taco at the 
 Bell place. I had not seen it was a woman, figured some hairy old 
 grunt and was hoping he'd be gone by the time I headed up the road.
  
  Sure enough it was still there and I pulled in behind it. She got 
 out of the passenger side and came back. She won't make playboy but 
 she's a nice looking girl. 
  
  She'd been crying. She's trying to replace the fan belt with a fork
 and a pair of pliers. &quot;Nobody would stop she says&quot;. 
  
  So I proceed to do my thing and it doesn't work. The nut is totally 
 frozen to the shaft and always has been. It was going to take more 
 than I had so we did the triple A thing. She waited with the van and
 her dog. Everything she owns is in there. 
  
  Got her to a garage just before they closed, it's after six. 
 Gave her my number if they need parts.
  Got a big hug and more tears.
 Suddenly the world isn't so full of ass-holes any more.

  She's in a faded blue van with a white pop-top lic. 179FCX, headed
 for Portland Ore. if you see her along the way, give her a hand.
