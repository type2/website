This would be a somewhat bad idea, especially here in WA, as there are
many `Mr. Bubblehead' stickers on all kinds of VW's--Oval's passes them
out for free! (But they do say `Oval's Motorsports' on them), and I
believe the dealer also passes them out, too. It's also rumored that
the Mr. Bubblehead will give you license plate frames for free, if you
drive up in a Volkswagen. (Probably the cheap plastic kind, but neat
nonetheless.) David, how about putting that as a stop for GNATT? It's
in Tacoma.
