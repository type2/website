While on the topic of tires--I'm sure this has been discussed numerous   
times before, but I've only been on the list for a while--I'm trying to   
decide on tires for my '89 Westfalia.  I just read the tire FAQs on

 http://www.vanagon_dot_com/info/faq
and
 http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/faq.html#tire

Right now, I have Michelin MXL 205/70 R14 97R's.  I assume the 97R has   
something to do with a reinforced sidewall.  Is this true?

I'd like to hear opinions on what you think is the best choice.  The FAQs   
list the following ones:

 - Michelin XZX 185/70 SR 14
 - Michelin MXL 205/70 R 14 Reinforced
 - Michelin MXT 205/70 R14
 - Michelin LTX 195/75 R14 (LT version)
 - Yohohama Y370 LT 195 75/R14
