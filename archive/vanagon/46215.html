Subject: Bus Boys (and UPS) Delivers



To All:

At 1403, Tuesday afternoon the UPS truck bounded up the hill to deliver a new
drag link for my 1965 bus, exactly on time.  The part was ordered Friday
afterrnoon from Jim at Bus Boys, who said UPS could have it here in two
working days, Redding and Vista being in the same State although more than
500 miles apart.

The drag link was complete, right down to nuts and cotter keys, the bare
metal protected by a film of oil.  The drag link is now sprayed with red lead
and will get two coats of Rustoleum's Gloss Black sometime tomorrow.  It
should be ready for installation Friday.  Because of the nature of the
rod-end fittings, the paint must be allowed to air-dry.

Replacement of the drag link will leave only 81 items on my Inuvik check-off
list.  

-Bob
