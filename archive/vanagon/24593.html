&gt; Thom:
&gt; 
&gt; The term &quot;7-door panel&quot; Bus is actually something I picked up from Mr. VanBondo.
&gt; Albeit I probably mis-quoted the afore-mentioned sir.  7-door panel refers to the
&gt; double cargo-door panel Busses.  The driver and passenger front doors count as
&gt; two, the cargo doors on the right and left side of the Bus count as four more
&gt; while the rear acces hatch counts for one more for a total of 7 doors.  It is
&gt; really kinda cool to have all of the doors open.  I do think that I made a mistake
&gt; in an earlier thread by calling it a walk-thru panel.  I initially thought that
&gt; this referred to the fact that you could &quot;walk through&quot; the Bus with all of the
&gt; cargo doors open.  Upon logical reflection, I think the walk-thru panels had the
&gt; two front seats instead of the bench seat.  I am pretty sure this is right because
&gt; when someone talks about a walk-thru Kombi I know they are referring to the two
&gt; front seats.  Surely the same logic applies to the panels.... I apologize to the
&gt; list for rookie remark... I am learning though!

I've always heard the term &quot;jump-through&quot; used to describe a bus with 
double cargo-doors, and as you said, &quot;walk-though&quot; to describe a bus 
with two separate seats.
