Subject: Re:1990 Vanagon Engine Clatter, Help!


&gt; Well I've finally got the new-to-me 1990 engine installed in my 87
&gt; Syncro.
&gt; It started up just fine but is making a lot of clattering. I think
&gt; it's just
&gt; valve lifters, but I'm not sure. I've run it a total of 

Can you tell if the clatter is one side or the other, or (from the 
frequency) how many cylinders are involved?  Is it constant (every 
revolution) or intermittent?

I'd be interested in the opinions on this one, too - all geniuses out there 
please post your replies to the list!
