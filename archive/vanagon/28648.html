&gt; OK,
&gt; 
&gt; Now I'm sadly sure even now that this is primarily going to end up a
&gt; west coast thing, so before that happens, since the likelihood
&gt; of us east coasters having enough time to get out there, then
&gt; blow 3 weeks then get back is for most of us totally impossible,
&gt; I feel we need an alternative, and less we fail to get on the
&gt; ball I think we should start planning alternatives now.
&gt; 
I myself have been bending over backwards trying to work out a way to
go from North CArolina.But, indeed, 7 weeks is a LOOOOOOONG vacation, and the State usually
doesn't like such things...
Anyway, I really really really want to be in on *something* bus-trip
related, so tentatively count me in for such an east coast thing.
Richard
