Subject: VW of  A

Well my '91 Vanagon with 78,000 miles was diagnosed (by a VW dealer) 
with blown head gaskets. I followed historical advice on the list and 
opened a &quot;case&quot; with Volkswagen of America.  The person assigned to my 
case never contacted me, but did contact the dealer where I took the VW. 
I called the case worker today.... the news wasn't good.  VWof A 
couldn't help me because I didn't have periodic services performed by a 
VW dealership.  Anyone have a suggestion?  I know several people on the 
list got help from VW of A.  Were your periodic services done at a VW 
dealership?

Jud
