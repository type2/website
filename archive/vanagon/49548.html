&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I just talked w/ a guy today about a '61, and he says it has a beetle
&gt; &gt;engine in it (he thought it was a '65 engine). As I recall, the 61 had a
&gt; &gt;1200 w/ 36 HP stock, but he's saying the 65 engine is a 1300 w/ 40 HP.
&gt; &gt;Was the 1300 still available in 65? Anyone know the engine ID to look
&gt; &gt;for?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;thnx.
&gt; 
     The 65 intake manifold, where it meets the head, was made large
     in that year. It can be said that before 65 the intake went
     straight vertical in to the head. This is an easy way to tell.
