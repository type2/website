&gt;Original appearance: new blue and white with clean soft top, NOS pop
&gt;out windows, new upholstery, beautiful.  2 liter engine by Steve
&gt;Phillips.  Bug tranny and CV joints.  Turns under 3000 RPM at 60 mph
&gt;Disc brakes up front.  Very solid mechanically.  No rust, garaged,
&gt;2nd owner.   $8900
&gt;Anyone else think this is a bit much?

well ... IF it was in virtually brand new condition, and IF i had that kind
of money laying around burning a hole in my pocket, it might not be toooooo
much. but since this is the real world, i'd bet it's only worth about $3000
(if that much). i mean, after all, he's already dorked it up with a 2.0 liter
engine ... and let Steve Phillips (whoever the hell he is!) get his grubby
fingers on it. and screwed up the original brakes. hell, it's not a Vintage
Original any more!!!

yeah. it's a bit much. he's been reading too many For Sale Ads in HOT VWs! :)
