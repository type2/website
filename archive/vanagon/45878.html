&gt; Yes I am playing with your minds.  I scanned the pictures upside down (yes it's a new

And now that I think about it....  I do remember looking at the pictures and 
wondering
&quot;why does it look like there is some rust on the rear driver's side panel?&quot;  You 
see
the rear driver's side panel was crunched in a minor accident so it's newly 
repainted,
but there is a bit of rust on the rear passenger side panel.  Guess my brain 
wasn't
firing on all 2 cylinders that day.
