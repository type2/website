Subject: Re: Westy tent for sale

Quoth David Schwarze:

&gt; I guess I'm rambling, huh? 

's okay, David.  Swap meets have the same effect on me. :-)

&gt; on it.  The tent is yellow, with a dark blue top, and about 6 by 9 feet.
&gt; It has a screen door with a canvas cover that is striped.  The tent is held
&gt; up by aluminum poles, and attaches to the rain gutter of the bus.  It also
&gt; has extra canvas that attaches around the sliding door to make a good seal
&gt; against bugs.  The tent is in great shape except for a tear in the front

&gt;From your description, I'd say yeah, this is what I call the &quot;drive-away&quot; 
tent, c. 1967/68 to 197?.  It should hang from an external frame and have a 
grey floor.  It should also have screen windows with flaps that zip up 
from the inside bottom edge, and a big zippered flap that covers the 
opening to the sliding door when you've gone on a day-trip in your Westy.

   *plug* See my WWWWesty Tent Page for more info on tents! *plug*

$400 is not unusual, though I'd try to talk 'em down 1) on general 
principles and 2) based on the raccoon tear.  It should have poles to 
hold the front flap open like an awning, plenty of stakes, and six guy 
ropes (original grommets &amp; tensioner-thingies), along with one bag for the 
tent and another for the poles (both sort of royal blue).  Any of this 
missing?  Deduct more $.

BTW this is a great backpacking tent. :-) :-)
