  My biggest pet pieve so far though is that the defroster won't
run without the compressor on.  Why does VW think you need to run the
compressor to blow heat onto the windshield?

   VW like so many other cars today run the compressor with the
   defrosters. This keeps the seals in the feon lubricated and
   keeps the compressor from rusting in place over the winter.
