Subject: FS  85 Vanagon GL  N. California

It's time to part with my trusty 85.  I have been it's only owner for 12
years.  Now I have to get a 4 wheeler 
for my wife to get to work in the winter time.  

Anyway, what I have is an 85 GL with 169K with the  weekender seat. No
AC. It's in very nice condition as I have carefully maintained her
through the years.  Last November, I did a top end rebuild complete with
rebuilt RIMCO heads, new rings, complete gaskets and seals, clutch disc,
throwout bearing, phosphate free coolant and some other stuff.  I also
did a recent dis-assembly of the CV's with new grease and some new
boots.  Also replaced front pads, changed brake fluid, master cyl, and
other routine maintenance items.  

She has good rubber all around.  Three UniRoyal Laredo light truck tires
and one original Conti light truck tire.

Runs great; absolutely no leaks of any kind.

$4100
