&gt;The next CCC's camping trip (other than the one you guys are
&gt;stewing over imminently) is slated for April 27th at Red Rock.  However,
&gt;a few have indicated that they would rather go somewhere now, since
&gt;many visited Red Rock last year.  
&gt;

I'm planning on making this trip and on doing a little Syncro 4 wheeling.
 Come on Syncro owners, lets kick a little dirt!!
