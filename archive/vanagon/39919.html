Hey all,
Today I received an order from RMMW.  Contained within were three items,
one gas cap, one passenger side step pad, and one bitchin' mug (Invest
in Precious Metals, with the picture of the bus on it).

I needed a new gas cap because the PO had put one of those generic Stant
locking gas caps on it ('78) after his original was stolen.  The new one
fits a lot better and I think it keeps gas from sloshing out a lot
better too.  

The passenger side step pad (the little rubber mat that you step on to
get inside the car in the front) I replaced because my old one was
missing.  Now my girlfriend won't slip and slide anymore getting in th
bus :) .  

I got the mug because I really dig it :) .  Plus it's really big.  Can't
wait to fill it up with some good coffee :) .

In other bus news, I'm still waiting for my shipment from WCM which
contains a new oil pressure switch and two seat belt hangers for the
front (mine are broken/nonexistent so my seat belts get all tangled up
when they're sitting on the seat).  When I ordered, the hangers were out
of stock so I told them just to ship the order complete when they came
in.  I keep calling to check on the status of the order but I'm on hold
so long that I get disconnected from their system.  It should be coming
soon, I guess.  

When I have a full tank of gas, I can smell the gas inside the car.
It's not related to the new gas cap as this has been going on for some
time.  I can't smell gas outside the car at all, even when I get my nose
right up to the filler cap but inside the car, particularly in the gas
filler side of the luggage compartment, I can smell gas.  Looking in
through the filler opening, everything seems to be intact.  What are
thoughts on where a leak might be?  Filler neck?  The smell only occurs
when the tank is full.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Sean
