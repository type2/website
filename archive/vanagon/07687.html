Subject: Replacement Pop-top Canvas:  Whose is best?

&gt;  Well, it's time to replace my pop-top canvas and probably the
&gt;gasket too.  Who has the best replacements?  Who should I avoid?
&gt;Whitney's doesn't have a 3 window unit for a '75, how about
&gt;others?

John - 

I have a '76 pop-top, and recommend JC Whitney for the rubber.  
Use the 3M Weatherstrip Adhesive to glue it on.

Canvas is available from VW Canvas, in Austin, TX:

Earnest Fannin

5505 Cordell
Austin, TX  78723
512-926-6195

H also makes awnings and stuff.  Well made.  Expect to pay ~$250.
