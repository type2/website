So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; i think you have to remember that this bunch is the result of a strange
&gt; sequence of circumstances ... not the least of which is that we all have
&gt; access to computers AND the internet. i'm sure there are lots and lots of
&gt; other buses out there, but many of them do NOT have computer access, OR
&gt; simply don't know about the list. hell, there are lots of folks with vw's
&gt; who don't even know about the vw magazines!
&gt; 
&gt; Remember!  Information is like Fertilizer!
&gt;            (it works better if you spread it around). ;)
