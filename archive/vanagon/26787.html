Subject: Re: cargo hauls/fire brick&amp;ponies!

&gt;As for hauling firebrick, I prefer to simply keep a close eye on the
condition of the fuel line and use the pencil clamps! =)

I used to work with a gal at a restuarant that said that her mom used to
take her to equestrian meets with her mini-pony in the back of the microbus.
I just laughed at the time wondering what would have happened if &quot;ol hos&quot;
decided to start kicking and freaking out inside of the bus. I also wondered
about potential calamity in a panic stop situation. Then there are other
more organic aspects that we won't delve into...
I wonder if the bus was a bench or &quot;trot-through&quot; ;)

&gt;&gt;Caught him some miles later at a roadside attraction and,
&gt;&gt;when my Dad asked how he did that, he showed us a half-ton
&gt;&gt;of firebrick on the floor.  His center of gravity must have
&gt;&gt;been just above the axle...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Now that's major soundproofing!

&gt;P.S. Or is it in preparation for the next installment in the &quot;Manifold 
&gt;Destiny&quot; thread?  :)
