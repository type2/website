Subject: Tunes for the trip

&gt;I'll try to find the words for you, Sstones et. al for Hot Rod
&gt;Lincoln.  

The only version I've heard was done by Asleep at the Wheel, reprised for
that awful HillBilly movie, I know the song is older.
Personally, I prefer bands such as The Clash, The Specials, Elvis Costello
and some of our fine Canadian Bands:JUGHEAD, BareNaked Ladies, Moxy
Fruvous, and Uisce Beathe(pronouned Ishka Baja). Now this is some motorin'
music. Also Bob Marley for those long stretches.
