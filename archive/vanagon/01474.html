Subject: Hand-Brake Cable Installation...


I am in the process of trying to fit a new front cable for the hand brake 
on an '82 
Vanagon and have come up against something smack in the middle above the 
gas tank that will not allow the cable to slide freely forwards or 
backwards. The Haynes manual is useless on this one... any ideas out 
there? I hope I don't have to remove the tank to get at the grommet or 
whatever that is holding the cable in place....


Thanks in advance - DC
