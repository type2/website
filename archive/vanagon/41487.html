&gt;&gt;&quot;VW TENT - add on to van, water and wind proof, very attractive, 
never
&gt;&gt;used, from Germany, $600 firm. 360-385-9627&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Already sold.  Drat!
&gt;

I have a 70's Westfalia tent that I would like to sell.  Since I 
found a Vanagon tent last month I will not be needing it anymore.  
It is not new, but is in good used condition, with all the poles, 
etc.  I am asking $475, which is roughly what I paid for it a 
couple of years ago.  I am in eastern Pa.
