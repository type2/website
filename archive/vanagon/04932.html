Ok, 

	I'll throw my hat in the ring.

	A few years ago, some auto rag put the same question to their writers,
and while they all had the standard &quot;Lambo Countach&quot; &quot;F40&quot; &quot;959&quot; and so
on for answers, one guy sez &quot;VW fox&quot;  He said that if cost was no object,
then why worry about spending so much to impress the neighbors?  or somehting
along thoselines.

	Personnally, I'll take an early 50's barndoor 23 window bus, with 
semaphores and safaris, of course!
