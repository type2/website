Subject: Re: '87 Syncro For Sale


&gt;
&gt;In today's Minneapolis Star-Tribune:
&gt;
&gt;'87 VW Vanagon Syncro 4X4.  Good shape hi mi, needs engine, exec 
stereo.
&gt; $300.  (612) 789-9939
&gt;
&gt;Haven't called on it but $300?!?!?!
&gt;
Called the Star Tribune.  Two errors in the ad.  One was the phone 
number.  The other was the price.  He wants $3000.00.
Knew it was too good to be true!
Correct # is 782-9939, if anyone is still interested.
