Subject: Re: Normal Temperature?

    IF the gauge on the highway is no longer sitting where it normally
    was there is a problem. MOst of which is air in the system, or
    a leak in the system. Or the gauge could be off!

&gt; Tim Smith said the temperature needle should &quot;sit over the  LED&quot; on a

&gt; over the LED but now sits slighly clear above the LED in normal North
&gt; Carolina conditions but rises to cover the little white dot and even higher
&gt; sometimes if driven at 65 to 70 in 100 degree Nebraska heat (late July '96)
&gt; and the radiator fan comes on HIGH on slowing down.  The temperature then
&gt; falls to normal.  The cooling system otherwise seems to be in good
&gt; conditions and is properly purged of air.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this normal?  What could be the problem?  What do others observe when
&gt; their vanagons are driven hard in hot temperatures?
&gt; 
&gt; Note: Oil temperature remained at 210 to 220 max under these conditions.
&gt; Oil level was kept near the bottom of the operating range.  No aux oil
&gt; cooler was used, just the standard water cooled device, 15W50 Mobil 1 oil,
&gt; temperaure measured at drain plug.
