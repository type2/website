&gt;Has anyone out there been able to go  
&gt;one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
&gt;without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?

Not me.  I had to replace the ignition key/lock last fall.  The CVs
and boots were replaced just last month in preparation of Inuvik.  
If you count those as &quot;regular maintenance&quot;.
Lucky me; The key/lock failed in the parking lot at work. 

I've done more individual camping trips last year than any other year.  
Red Rocks Campground, Bodega Bay/CA Wine Country, Arcata/Eureka, CA
Death Valley and Big Sur.  Absolutely trouble free miles! &lt;knock knock&gt;
Some of this roamin' around is due in part to a lack of GD tour.
