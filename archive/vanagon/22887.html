To All:

What am I missing here?

They make window-mount 110vac air-conditioners and roll-about de-humidifiers
(same refrigeration unit) that aren't much bigger than a bread box.  So you
mount the motor/compressor unit... somewhere, the condenser... somewhere
else, with a couple of biscuit-blowers attached, and the evaporator with
another fan or two in the cabin, with a drip-tray.  If the vehicle is well
insulated/shaded the unit will cool things down, dry them out, freeze your
toes if you leave it on long enough.

Or you could rig your regular automotive A/C compressor to be driven by a
110vac motor mounted in the engine compartment... or by a one-lunger pony
engine, for that matter.  Typical A/C compressor only needs 3 to 5 hp.

Was it that someone wanted to use a particular window A/C unit as a plug-in?
 I've seen these on big pick-up mounted campers (small ones too, for that
matter), hanging off the back.  Seems like you'd have to modify the rear
hatch if you wanted to do that on a Westy.  But sticking one on the roof
seems do-able.

If you want to use shore-power A/C, do it.  What am I missing here?
