Subject:      HELP!!

I have had it! I need a good reliable vehicle and I have been through this
for 6 mos. The fuel mixture is still not right. I had 2 weeks for this
particular problem to get resolved. I have the john muir book, and the
hanes
manual to set , re-set rather, the idle and fuel mixture. Why is this so
difficult? It seems like it should be straight forward. The timing has been
checked and reset. The fuel pump is new the injectors are in excellent
condition. Just about all of the fuel lines have been replaced. All the
vacuum lines have been replaced. I did all this just to be sure the idle
and
mixture were going to be dead on. I even had a shop do the timing, just to
make sure. I have spent nearly $3,000 on the re-build , because it had to
be
done twice, the first guy installed the old pistons and cylinders when they
should not have been re-used. I have a new 02 sensor. I have a new cylinder
head temp sensor. I have replaced the idle stabilizer. i have installed the
bosch platinum plugs because they seem to work better than the bosch
supers.
It is regularly over 100 degrees here and I am sure that the heat effects
the
vehicle in several ways. But I dont think it will effect the vanagon timing
and mixture settings. I do want it to run cooler and am thinking of
installing an external oil cooler. But not anymore, not if I dont get it
running right. Please someone help me! I have been dealing with this
problem
for nearly a year! I had the vanagon engine out last summer and it was down
for 2 months,. I dont have that luxury anymore. I need it running in order
to
start my new job next week! Thanks in advance for any helpful hints! I know
some of you have already e-mailed me but I think I may be looking in the
wrong direction. You think?
