Subject: '81 running on


I've asked this of a few list members so far, and am compliling a list
of the reponses, but thought I'd put the matter out to the membership
at large, and gather as many comments as possible to take to my
mechanic as things to check for.

My '81 westy (with newly rebuilt engine) is occasionally suffering
from what others have called (or disputed) any of the following:
pre-ignition, running on, dieseling.  This doesn't usually happen
during normal city driving, but after longer freeway treks, during
which time, the temperature tends to elevate higher than normal
as well.  When I turn off the key, the engine will sometimes not
quit for up to 15 seconds.  At other times, it may only be just
a few seconds longer than seems normal.

&gt;From the 2 or 3 people I've asked so far, the following are their
comments on either what the problem is, or what might be tried to
solve it:

        ignition switch is not turning it off completely?
        bad connection at the switch?
        bad coil?
        wiring connections from the switch to the coil?
        other electrical problem?
        one or more injectors kinda leaking or still firing? 
        electrical problem with power relays for the fuel injectors?
        carbon on pistons?
        try retarding the timing?
------

Now, since the engine was rebuilt only about 7K miles ago, and I've
run some techron thru there just to see if that would eliminate the
problem, I doubt the cause is carbon build up.  The car has just
been tuned, and otherwise runs very well, although I &quot;think&quot; that
this problem makes it go out of tune more quickly than normal, and
I &quot;think&quot; I notice some bucking in 3rd or 4th gear, although the
problem is almost so slight as to be ambigious.

Anyway, whatever suggestions I get either to the list, or via e-mail,
I'll add gladly to the above, when I go visit the mechanic.  All
advice appreciated!
