Skip: many thanks for the advice, which I will follow. It turns out that
the number three intake valve seat was pressed in and exhaust was escaping
out the side. Since all four cylinders were showing low compression, I
have decided to have both heads re-built by MS with a view to bring up the
compression on all four. In the event the bottom end goes, at least I
will have decent heads.

The mechanic also showed me that the crankshaft had a little play in - it up
and down - (perhaps half a mil?). The in and out endplay was fine though.
Any thoughts on this one? 

I am still going after GEX to see if they will cover some of the labour costs.
They did for a fellow who had his engine go at 15k. Mine has 20k.


Thanks again - DC
