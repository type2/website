Subject: Re: Vans in europe?

&gt;With all this talk about used vans no longer being cheap in
&gt;Europe....I wonder if it would be worth while, if one were to
&gt;be in Europe on an extended trip (more than a month...) to ship
&gt;one's own camper/van from the US to Europe, and then ship it back
&gt;when the trip was over.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know what it costs to ship cars back and forth?
&gt;

I know it's been done. I believe Tim Smith did it some time ago. I believe
he rented a container (and some very strong bungee cords).

My own experience in Europe is that south of Scandinavia the campgrounds
suck (the Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong are allotted more space). But
it does give you freedom and certainly spares you some outrageous hotel
fees.

And once you're north of Denmark you can free-camp anywhere you like. And,
of course, you save even more on hotels and restaurants. We hit the Arctic
Circle on June 21st (not that far south of Inuvik, btw). Marvelous!
