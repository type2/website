Subject: re: Need auto-stop propane tank valve

   Oh yeah- I don't have one of those fancy electric water pumps for
my sink either so I rigged up a hand pump that fits neatly behind the
drivers seat. There must be some kind of cheap electric pump that can
be modified use for the same purpose...any ideas? I refuse to pay VW
for their over-priced parts (make that 'I can't pay')...

   Thanks,

----------------
While checking over an '83 Westy, I noticed the stock electric pump 
is identical to the one my father-in-law just got for his Bus (MCI, 
that is). He got it at an RV place for $25 CDN or so, I believe, so 
you should be able to find one without too much trouble.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
