&gt;
&gt;I'm shopping for a VDO Oil Pressure Gauge and have noticed that most 
&gt;vendors offer both an 80psi and a 150psi model.
&gt;I'd like to hear opinions on which I should get and why...
&gt;
&gt;Also, I found a listing for &quot;100psi Oil Pressure Gauge (Mechanical)&quot;
&gt;What is the difference between this one and the regular ones?
&gt;

&gt;

Mechanical ones have the thin tube of oil running from the engine to the gauge.

80 should be plenty unless your in the freeze alot, in which case you may
want to know how hard it's pegging when you first fire it up at 30 below.  A
good reason not to get the mechanical.
