Subject:      weird vanagon camper!

I was driving down rte 6 in Eastham (CapeCod) Ma and saw the strangest
vannagon conversion!  It was alot like the old bus conversions to an RV back.
It had the front end of a vanagon (round headlights) but behind the front
doors it had a wider body like a truck camper.  Plus it had an
overhanging top where I assume there was a bed.  It was goig by the
opposite way so I didnt get a good look at it.  Anybody out there own it?
(or seen one?!)
