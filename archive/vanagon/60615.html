I have an '89 5speed manual Transporter with non-standard leather seats.  
The driver's seat is about 1/2 inch higher than standard.
I am 5ft 10in and have no trouble adjusting the driver's seat to a
comfortable position.

However, my wife, at 5ft 3in, has real problems.  The causes are the height
of the clutch and brake pedals and the long travel of the clutch pedal.   
She has to lift her feet to reach the clutch and, if she sits at a
comfortable distance from the steering wheel, she has difficulty in fully
depressing the clutch. 

Has anyone met this problem and can anyone offer any hints on modifications
to help.   (I thought of looking for a taller wife but that has certain
difficulties :-)  )
