Grendel Saga....

&gt;        A not so good thing hapened this week.  In Oregon it is unlawfull to
&gt;pump your own fuel (no self-serv).
&gt;        Due to a mis-communication (ya, right.  He didn't listen to me when
&gt;I said Diesel.  He also didn't read the Diesel Fuel Only sticker)my '82
&gt;Diesel got filled (he added apx 6 gal.) with un-leaded gasoline.
&gt;        Now I know that in a pinch I could have added a couple quarts of
&gt;non-detergent oil and been on my way.  But no, I told them to call a service
&gt;truck to drain my tank.
&gt;        I had my Bently book with me, that made the job a little easer.
&gt;After siphoning the tank the fuel line was removed from the bottem of the
&gt;tank untill no fuel came out.  After the tank was enpty (I banged on it, it
&gt;was empty) my guage still said it had about 1/4 tank left and when it was
&gt;refilled it took just under 12 gal to fill my 16 gal tank.  Where were the
&gt;other 4 gal hiding?
&gt;        It's run OK sense this happened, I am going to change the fuel
&gt;filter today.  The service truck guy said that this particular station makes
&gt;this same mistake about twice a month.
