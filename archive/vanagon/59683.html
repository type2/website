Subject: The continuing saga

Recap of the story to date...  About a month ago, my 82 westy Peewee,
began to run really rough, smoking more than I do, and would die if I
took my foot off the gas. Thanks to the list, I got some good imput: 
Checked and cleaned all the pigtail connections and grounds, no go, 
Checked the #2 temp sensor and it checked out within specs,  Checked the
cold start injector by disconnecting it and isolating it from the gas
flow, no luck, Finally, thinking there was no other hope, I bought a
used AFM from some folks in Fort Worth and replaced the one I had hoping
that some ghost in the old one was hexing the system, no go there
either. ($150 down the drain!)  Now I'm beginning to wonder if the ECM
has gone out on me.  I hope not, but I'm running out of options. 
Anybody got any sage advice?
Chaz
