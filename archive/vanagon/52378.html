Subject: 1993 EV GL FS in Indianapolis

     Hi all,
     
     Here are the specifics:
     
     Metallic blue + no body damage
     69k miles
     A/T
     Bench, rather than individual, middle seating
     Firestone Affinity tires
     Asking $13,995
     
     The car is at:
     
     Tom Wood VW/Subaru/Nissan
     3300 E. 96th Street
     Indianapolis, IN   46240
     317-848-8888
     800-968-3886
     
     I took the car out for a brief test drive and I felt it did OK, though 
     I felt it idled roughly. Since this was my first experience with an 
     EV, I don't know whether a tune-up would cure this or if this is 
     normal for the Audi-5 cylinder engine.
