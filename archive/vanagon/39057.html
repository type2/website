Subject: Joel... Change the Stats...!! well... maybe not...

I'm on my way this morning to pick up the three Bugs I just 
bought... I will be keeping at least one...
	
	1) '57 deluxe (not much floor left, but nice Motorola Radio)
	2) '64 deluxe (almost no rust, neat blue pin-stripe cloth 
interior)
	3) '70 standard ( rust on on door sill, single year 1600 sp)

	all three ran 3-4 years ago, couldn't resist the price... $500

	I have already sold the '57 sight unseen...
	the '70 is being looked at this weekend...
	the '64 has found a new home where he'll be treated with 
respect.. and it has a NOS tool kit ( vinyl pouch) with tools still 
covered in Cosmoline/preservative....

		And MY Wife is THRILLED!! yeah right...
