The Eurovan is there.

Thanks for the reply.  I didn't know to look for &quot;VW Van/Truck&quot; The =
downside is that Kelley's is way higher than Edmund's or NADA. They =
assign a retail price for this EV GL at $20,130 and the wholesale at =
$15,415! (Edmund's was 14507 &amp; 17507, and NADA was 13575 &amp; 17250.) The =
excruciating thing is that it all depends on what the dealer is willing =
to do.

Not that this will have an impact on my purchasing an EV, but on one of =
the Yahoo automotive links, (I think CARveat Emptor) there is an =
anonymous page about some guy's miserable experience with three =
different VW transactions. From the tone of his page, he probably is a =
chronic complainer, no matter what he drives. I know about the =
fragile/expensive to repair rear door and bumper on the EV, and the =
mechanical / electrical gremlins that may or may not be present, but =
these are probably no better or worse than other vans on the market. One =
thing he did mention that caught my attention was the gas tank placement =
of the EV, that it was similar to the sidesaddle placement of the GM =
pick ups. VW makes it a point to mention that they use plastic fuel =
tanks placed well inboard to minimize their exposure to rupture and =
explosion. Any EVers look under their vans to confirm the fuel tank's =
material and placement?

Overly analytical,
