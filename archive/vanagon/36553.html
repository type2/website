Subject: type IV oil temp sending uni location

Howdy,
Does anybody know of a great place to mount the oil temp sending unit
 on a Type IV? With my upright motors I would mount them in the drain
 plate or tee off the pressure sending unit hole. I don't want to tee
 off the pressure unit because I would need to modify the tin and I
 don't think that it is the most accurate place. Could I drill a hole
 in the sump(?) plate on the bottom- the one right beneath the oil
 tube- or is there a better location.

Busboys offers a predrilled sump plate in their catalog for this purpose--$20
