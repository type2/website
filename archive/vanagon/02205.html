Subject: Re: Gasoline difference

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Was there any difference in octane rating between the two brands? 

No. There was on octane change. I always use octane 87 gas only.

&gt;&gt;Wouldn't higher octane not only increase power but make the engine more 
&gt;&gt;&quot;efficient? Have you had any minor (air filter/ fule filter) or major 
&gt;&gt;(valves, head) r/r recently done?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;There are too many variables at work here to narrow 
&gt;&gt;the change down to one monolithic causal factor.... 
&gt;&gt;Ideally you would want a control group and a comparison test to verify 
&gt;&gt;your results.

I wasn't doing a test of gasolines therefore it wasn't any sort of controlled
study. But as far as I can remember there was nothing changed except I commute
20 more miles a day. BTW, I don't believe higher octane gas gives you more power.
This is a godd subject to be discussed in this group, I think.
