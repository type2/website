&gt;&gt; It would be my primary vehicle as well as my camper. I'm not a power demon,
&gt;&gt; the V-4 seemed OK. (Though rumor has it that a V-6 is in the offing for later
&gt;&gt; this year.)
&gt;
&gt;V-4?  Not the In-line 5?


VW introduces a more compact version of the VR6:  the VR5.
I'll try and see if i can get the details.

Brian.
