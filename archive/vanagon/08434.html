&gt;&gt; Are you inviting all of us?

&gt;&gt; Sounds like fun. If I'm buying, the quality of lunch will decline in

&gt; that counts, right? Right? Bob, are you there? Do you like pizza?

I love ALL kinds of FREE food! ;)

Don't know if you're a vanagon guy or not, but those of us with the slower,
older buses can hang out in the parking lot afterwards fixing them!
