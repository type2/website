Subject:      eurovan recall

the sep/oct 94 issue of vw autoist says:

Eurovan: VW is recalling 8,350 1993 Eurovans equipped with impact
collapsible steering wheel. The steering column assembly includes a
universal joint that is attached to the steering shaft and secured by
locking bolts.  The upper locking bolt was not sufficiently torqued
during manufacture and can eventually loosen.  A loosened bolt could
render the steering system inoperative and cause an accident.
