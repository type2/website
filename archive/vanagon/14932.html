Subject: Re: Manual Pages Needed: Coolant Change



I've had that burbling noise with my '82. It did dissappear when I did a
thorough bleed job; front end of van on ramps, heater temp lever on &quot;hot&quot;,
and a tube from the rad bleeder screw to a bottle so that I could monitor
the air/coolant purged from the rad as I keep an eye on the resevoir back
at the engine.
