Subject: Conti tire pressure?
Date: Wed, 20 Jul 94 9:44:05 EDT


Tomorrow we're leaving on the grand trip: Windsor (read Detroit) - San 
Diego - Wash St - LA - and home.

Problem: the van ('87 Westfalia) came with Continentals, the 185 size. On
the tire it says max PSI 40. The door jamb plate says front 39, rear 48.

What advice can I get from the listmembers? I presume I don't want to go
tooling past Yuma with 8 lbs over the manufacturer's recommendation.
