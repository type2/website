Subject: put on new oilcooler

I just installed a bug-pack 72 plate cooler on my '71 1641cc.   Didn't 
want to spend the money on a full flow system, so took off stock cooler 
in the fan shroud.  Put on a different fan shroud, the kind with out the 
off-set space for the original cooler.  This increased space between the 
front of the shroud and the firewall.  mounted the new cooleron brackets 
just in front of the intake hole on the front of the shroud.  There is at 
least 2&quot; clearance between the shroud and the cooler, and between the 
cooler and the wall.  My normal driving temp was about 210-220  The temp 
was reduced 20-30 degrees F.  I am stoked!
