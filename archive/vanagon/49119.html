Subject: Re: Tires again! Please help!!!!

Nate, The  tires actuelly are about the same rolling radius, so the speedo is
the same and the gearing is unchanged.The part I appreciate most is the
handling.The sidewalls stay stiff(6 ply rated) so no wandering like the 4 ply
tires(CAVEAT VANAGONERS...DONT USE A 4 PLY NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!!!!!!) and more
rubber on the road for cornering and,especially,snow(try them in a Montana
blizzard w/ 2 feet on the ground...more rubber is better rubber)and they seem
to be wearing great(28k mi w/ less than 1/2 wear. Im not sure if they will
fit on a stock vanagon rim...mine are 5.5x14 and they sit perfectly square on
the rim.Ive tried Michelin MXL, MXV ,Yokohama 008, 352 ,Pirelli P77, Uniroyal
and these maximas.Hey they are just great.Also, finally I could run the tires
at 44 psi when my westy was loaded with.....hang-on....5 adults,3 children
all luggage and 12 pairs of skis(1 snowboard) for 1800 miles in December San
Diego to Banff(yes I am a liitle NUTS)........Whew what a load......
