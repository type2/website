Subject: RE: CA licenseplate.


&gt;        Is it possible to have a genuine
&gt;California license plate made with
&gt;just any text? If so, is there someone out
&gt;there that can help me getting such a plate?
&gt;I'm in the Netherlands, Europe.

Yes, but you have to register a car in California to get it.
Up to seven characters and a half space, or fewer characters and more
spaces anywhere you want. Naughty words forbidden, and you can't get it
if someone else already has that plate, obviously.
