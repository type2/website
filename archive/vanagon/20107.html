So Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; (If you're interesting in foundry work, the same burner assembly provides
&gt; enough heat to melt a good-sized crucible of aluminum in about twenty
&gt; minutes.)

Or..... if you go to one of the West Coast (Left Coast for you newbe's), 
you can witness a foundry in a fire ring demonstration by Mr. Bradley.
