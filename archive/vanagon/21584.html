Subject:       Fluke automotive DMMs

Does anyone have experience with the Fluke model 88, which is 
specifically for automotive use.  Is it worth the extra cost above 
the model 87, which is an all-purpose one, albiet high-end.  How 
about the Scope-meter, with the LCD oscilliscope screen.  Lastly, 
although Fluke pricing seems to be pretty standard, is there a 
retailer that has good prices?

as you can tell, i'm in the market for one.
