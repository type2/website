I think I've decided to name my Brick &quot;Rosalie&quot; after the rotund 
German-American housewife in the film &quot;Rosalie Goes Shopping&quot;. Rosalie 
is played by Marianne Sagebrecht who was also the lead in &quot;Bagdad Cafe&quot;

Rosalie did drive a conversion van (Chevy) around her adopted hometown 
of Stuttgart, Arkansas, with Arkansas plates reading &quot;CHARGEIT&quot;.

The film is a spoof on the Savings and Loan crisis and how one woman 
strikes back. --
