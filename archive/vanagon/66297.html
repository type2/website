 9. Doesn't seem to have a compentent support organization (dealers).
 8. Mir doesn't have get buffeted by 18-wheelers passing by.
 7. Mir's heat exchangers are easier to find.
 6. Mir is more aerodynamic and gets MUCH better fuel economy
    (how many YEARS has it been cirling around up there??)
 5. Mir doesn't have any problems finding the right size tires.
 4. Mir drivers don't get pulled over by the cops because of the
    Grateful Dead stickers on the back window.
 3. Mir hasn't had to buy license plates and registration stickers for =
YEARS.
 2. Mir doesn't have to buy insurance, either.
