Wheee!

Got my new seat covers for my bus yesterday.  YAHOO! 

&gt;From RMMW, BTW.

I know this isn't that earth shattering or anything, but I was all
happy but no one around here seemed to care (ie ([groan] heere he goes
with that bus stuff again!)

These are also the same people who looked on in disbelief when I told them 
about getting the bubble lights for $180 and what a steal they were!

BTW - the quality if the vinyl on these looks good, but he color doesn't 
look exactly like I pictured it, I was kinda hoping it would have more
blue, but instead it seems to have more yellow and/or red.  Forgive me,
but I am chromatically-detection-ally challenged.  Make that linguistically
challenged as well!  Somebody get me a gov'mt grant, QUICK!

Ok, I'm done.
