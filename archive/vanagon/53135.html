&gt; Well this little cylinder is humming away and annoying as hell!  It doesn't

&gt; Question:  What is this thing?  Is it suppossed to hum?  Should I replace it?

    It is a vacumme accuulator. Or called, a Vacumme amplifier. It may 
    have a leak in it, or dirt or a small amount of water, that will cause 
    this problem. The reason for this, is the axle Lock,  or anything that 
    needs more vacume than the engine can supply at one time. 

    My axle lock in my 2 wheel drive work fine without it!.
