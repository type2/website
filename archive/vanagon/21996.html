Subject: Re: QUESTION--Engine Restorer &amp; Tires

Yeah, I used Engine Restorer in a previous car ('84 Honda CRX with 
150,000 miles). It was crap. Didn't do a thing for me. Don't waste your
money. About the tires, the owner's manual for my '81 Westy reccomends
that you put reinforced tires (guess that means truck tires?) in the
rear of the vehicle. Hope this helps.
