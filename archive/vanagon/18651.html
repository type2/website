So thom fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Ok,
&gt; 	Well a lot's happened since I sent the last update.

Three cheers for Thom's triumphant return!  :)

  (and brilliant coup at getting a better paycheck to finance his VW!) ;)

&gt; SOTO meet, where it got rave reviews.  It was one of the better looking
&gt; busses there, actually.  Then I took it to Bug-O-Rama, where I think most
&gt; people ignored it.  The _fun_ thing was that I got to show it the the guy
&gt; who orginally sold it to me and his buddy, who couldn't believe it was the
&gt; same bus!

Ahhh, the ultimate compliment....

&gt; 	The big shakedown cruise was the Bodega trip, whereupon the brake
&gt; problem manifested itself.  I knew there was a problem, but I wanted to go
&gt; bad enough that I went anyway, and didn't let it get my spirits down.
&gt; (it did make the trip a bit hairy a few times, and I think the final brake
&gt; episode sent Steve Johnson to the Cardiac Ward!)

It's not really fair..  He hypnotized me with his on-off-on brake light
which had a mind of its own.  ;)
