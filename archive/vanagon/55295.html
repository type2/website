&gt; Any advice much appreciated.  My head gaskets are leaking after an
&gt;  overheat.  It's an '87 with 68K miles on it.  Should I kick down and do
the
&gt;  heads at the same time? The mechanic thinks it's almost always necessary.
&gt;   I've heard the contrary.

It is not always necessary.  They are typically replaced due to corrosion
pitting in the sead surface where it's supposed to seal with the gasket.  If
the corrosion is mild, it can be filled - list members have done it with
JBWeld material.
However, you mention an &quot;overheat&quot;.  This could also have damaged the heads,
so while the corossion may not cause you to replace them, this might.

Good luck,
