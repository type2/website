Subject: Re: Squeaking from front end (spare tire?) of Vanagon


&gt;The spare tire under the front end seems to squeak and groan
&gt;as it rubs against the metal sandwich it is contained in.


Wrap the spare in an old blanket, and cut a hole for the bolt! And yes,
get a new non-stripped bolt.

Old carpet works too, but is tougher to wrap around the tire.
