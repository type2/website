Subject: Rear Hatch Struts

I had been looking all over town and throughout the net for a set of rear 
hatch struts for my 83 Westy (no rear wiper).  I got a tip from a a fellow 
list member, Scott Maurer, who told me to try 

Halsey Import Auto Parts
7721 NE Halsey,
Portland, Or
(503) 256-0182
(800) 792-0081.

I'm sure glad that I did.  When I called they didn't have any in stock, but 
they now have  (40) pairs. oops! 39 pairs in stock.  I called all over town 
and surfed the net, and found prices ranging from $80/set (Dealer) to 
$50.00/set.

They are the correct German part and are identical to the existing ones in 
my Westy.   The only difference is that the new ones don't have the VW/Audi 
Logo on them.  I paid $31.00 for the set.  

You might give them a try if you are looking for that fairly expensive part,
 that just seems to cost too much......  BTW, I am not affiliated with them 
in any way.  Just a happy customer. (Standard disclaimer)

Good Luck!
