Subject: RE: Factory Fuel Injection


&gt;Anybody out there Know about factory fuel injection on my 1800cc
&gt;Type IV engine?
&gt;
&gt;The car is not getting fuel.  Could this be the fuel pump relay?
&gt;Where is it located?
&gt;
&gt;Also, should I just trash the injection system and buy carbs?


Trash the whole engine and put in a V6, with Holley carb!
Works for me.  :^)
