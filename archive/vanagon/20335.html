Subject: Re: rear vent windows for Eurovan

Holy smokes, Joel, you're fast. I just got this mag yesterday in the mail. BTW, 
Projektzwo is a German &quot;tuner&quot; company that plunked a hot-rodded VR6 in a 
Eurovan when they first came out. They also make a lot of high quality custom 
goodies, some of which look good and others that seem kind of tacky IMHO.

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Projektzwo offers a conversion for the VW Eurovan that allows you to use
&gt; the rear windows for ventilation. Extensive body work isn't needed. Simply
&gt; exchange the stock units &lt;windows&gt; for the Projektzwo motorized units,
&gt; install the motor and wire the cable. Cost is 495DM &lt;about $330US&gt;.
