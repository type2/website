Subject: Will EMail UU-encoded VW Bus Art for the asking

All,

I have three VW bus .JPG files I'll EMail to whoever wants them.

One has an old Splittie on the left, the VW logo in the middle, 
and a Late Bus on the right (TYPEII.JPG).  The next has a 
Vanagon on the left, the VW logo in the middle, and a Eurovan on 
the right (VANAGON.JPG).  The third file has, clockwise from 
upper left corner: an old Splittie, Late Bus, Eurovan and 
Vanagon; the VW logo is in the center (ALL4.JPG).

These are UU-encoded, 7-bit ASCII files, which will need to be 
unencoded for viewing.  I used WinVn to encode them.  You should 
be able to unencode them with WInVn, WinCode or a similar 
unencoding program downloadable from your internet provider.  
You'll also need a program for viewing/printing these images. 
Several shareware image viewing programs are available.  
PhotoShop, CorelDraw, etc., also work.

These files are stored at 300 dpi, so the files range in size 
from about 350k to 450k.

If anyone is interested in putting these up on your website for 
downloading, let me know.


Roy
