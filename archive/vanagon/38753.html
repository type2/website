&gt; Subject: What's a Pilot Bearing?
&gt;Tim (I think) mentioned a pilot bearing as being source of noise in
&gt;the Vanagon trans, but I'm not sure what this is, in Bentley terms.
&gt;I've heard it before, but never really knew what it meant, as my
&gt;experience with trannnies is limited to basic clutch replacements.

It's those little needle bearings inside the gland nut, which is the big
nut that holds the flywheel onto the crankshaft. The input shaft to the
transmission sticks into the pilot bearing when you re-install the
engine after changing the clutch. And yes, you *are* supposed to replace
the pilot bearing, even for a &quot;basic&quot; clutch job. It costs maybe $5 - $10.

And it's near the top of my list of suspects in the V6anagon's clutch
failure this last weekend, 400 miles from home with six people in the
car, of course.

Gonna have a talk with that bearing one of these days-- it and I need
to get a few things straightened out.  &gt;:-O
