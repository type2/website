&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone put an air-dam on their Bus? I'm taking a long trip this
&gt; &gt; &gt;summer and I'm trying to lower my gas mileage. There must be some type
&gt; &gt; &gt;of car with an air-dam that would bolt to the front bumper... Any 
&gt; &gt; suggestions?

&gt; I think I see the root of the problem here.  In Canada, mileage is measured in 
&gt; litres per 100 kilometers (volume/distance) whereas in the US, mileage is 
&gt; measured in miles per gallon (distance/volume).  In the interest of 
&gt; international detente, I thought I should clear up the fact that lowering your 
&gt; mileage is not as bizarre as it might sound if you live north of the border.
&gt; 
&gt; Other mileage lowering tips (I can't resist):
&gt; 
&gt; 1) disconnect your odometer.
&gt; 2) parachute (popped top will do in a pinch)
&gt; 3) ...?

 Very funny, compadres. But let us examine which of our cultures is
more 'on the ball', shall we. The term &quot;raising&quot; usually connotes something
'better' or 'more adventageous'. So, if you say that 'lowering your
gas mileage' is good, then you're involved in a sort of oxymoronic
phrase, are you not?
