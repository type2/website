	Went to the Swap meet today.  Didn't buy anything till I was about to
leave, then I wondered by this booth - a guy had little model microbusses in
a glass case!  Upon closer inspection, they turn out to be &quot;cal-busses&quot;, i.e.
lowered with wild paint jobs.  Still, they are quite nice.  They are about
5x2x2 inches, with the top made of plastic and the bottom 2/3 made of metal
(I think, could be thick plastic, but looks nice!).  They have rubber tires,
chrome bumpers, and the wierd part - the side doors look normal, but both
halves open as a single piece and slide backward a la breadloaf!  These things
even RUN!  If you pull them backwards and let go, they take off with
acceleration quite out of character of their real-life counterparts!  I
bought what I thought was the nicest of the models, light-blue over dark blue
with red VW emblems on the sides and a yellow-orange rainbow on either side
going back from the front wheelwells.

The best thing about them was the price... $3 for one or 3 for $6!!!!!  What
a deal!  The guy showed me the box they came in - had 12 busses in it and
he said he could sell the whole set for $18.  

Wasn't there someone in the UK that was looking for cal busses?  Well, if
anyone is interested, let me know and I will get back there and buy some
more of them and mail them out.  People in St. Louis and the DC area can
even avoid shipping costs, cause I am going to be in those areas next month.
The guy said he is there every weekend, so unless he was lying I should have
no trouble getting them.

Cheers,
	-David
