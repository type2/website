Subject: Vanagon Towing Capacity ??

Volks,
I have seen all the chatter concerning the hitches for the Vanagon. I'm
in an 87 GL Autoboxer, anyone have any data on how much rolling wieght
load I could safely tow with my rig. I was thinking around 1500lbs
rolling load. Anyone routinely towing this much wieght w/a
wasserboxer/autoboxer. Also, I am a flatlander with aspirations to
mountain towing. Comments/data glady recieved.
