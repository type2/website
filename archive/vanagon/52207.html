Does anyone know where to get paint for the plastic center caps on 14&quot;
Alloy wheels?  The wheels are the 5 spoke greyish mags, they're on an 87. 
Also, does anyone else have any ideas on how to keep the paint form peeling
off?  I replaced the original caps about 2 years ago and now almost all the
paint is gone on all four.  

Thanks
