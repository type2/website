Subject:      87 Stalls when cold

My 87 Wolfs with the recent tune-up runs OK, except for stalling when it is
cold.  After starting it cold, its idles 900 RPM and very steady.  As soon
as the gas is applied to move, the idle begins to drop and the van stalls.
The van runs fine after 5 minutes or so, just stalls at first.

I thought about the temperature sensor at the thermostat housing.  It
measured 1000 ohms &quot;cold&quot; (approx 90 degrees F outside, engine cold).
According to the Bentley, it should read 1500 to 2000 ohms.  Anybody have
any ideas?  500 ohms enough to cause the stalling?

Thanks-
