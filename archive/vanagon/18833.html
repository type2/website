Hi Volks,
	Dave and Shelley here - we are in Calgary, Alberta and managed to
get into a computer lab here - but it closes in 5 minutes!  :(  Anyway,
we have covered over 5,000 miles so far and all is looking good!  Pete
Sellers is with us, and we hope to meet up with more listmembers when we
get to BC on Friday.  Hope some of you are planning on showing up at the
Pizza lunch on Friday!

I am unsubscribed from the list, and will probably not be able to get access
again for a while - talk to you all when we get back!

-David
