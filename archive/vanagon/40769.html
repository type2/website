Subject: Re: Parting out~ 1967 camper

Needed for '67 Westy:

Need to replace the electric hook up box which is located on the driver's
side just behind the door. This piece does not have to be in excellent shape
but needs to be complete and not visually damaged. I am expecting to have it
bead blasted.

I wish to locate one and recieve it ASAP. I am tentatively trying to finish
this bus in time for the VW Classic in early June.
Any help will be highly appreciated.
