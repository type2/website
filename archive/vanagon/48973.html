 Hi Chris
I believe VW did most of the upgrades on the TriStar. There is a very
substantial brush guard on the front that bears a VW number and stamp. If a
coach builder added the brush guard I wonder if they would not have put VW
ID on it. The Syncro part was still done by Steyr and I suppose they could
have added the brush guard and rollbar. They do make note of Steyr on the
front bra. They  stitched &quot; STEYR/SYNCRO&quot; on the upper drivers side. The
TriStar really dosn't have Carat trim. The lower part of the panel is
painted flat black and there are plastic fender flares that tie in with the
black paint. I think the flares are TriStar only. Most of the add ons are
things that you could order on a 91 Vanagon like power windows, power locks,
and power mirrors. The paint color is the same burgandy that you can find on
a 91 Vanagon. It does have a seat heater that I have never seen (or
felt)before, but the switch is installed just ahead of the steering wheel in
a plastic shroud that looks very &quot;factory&quot;. There are three maplights with
folding courtesy handles that you can grab,  one over each door except the
drivers door. I understand they came out of Audis. One other thing is that
My Tristar has a very nice MOMO shift knob. I wonder if it came &quot;factory&quot;.
 I am wondering about the front brushguard. There are four holes drilled  in
it(2 holes in each upright). It looks as if a winch or something is supposed
to be there but I have nothing. Maybe someone can fill me in.
 The only thing on the vehicle that identifies it as a TriStar is a logo
sticker that says TriStar just below the windshield on the drivers side.
 If anyone knows more TriStar history please share it with us.
