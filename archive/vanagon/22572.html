Subject: Re: Should I fry this bus?

Dave,
&gt;You forgot to include the late '60s early '70s option of the &quot;stash hole.&quot;
&gt;The fuzz behind ya and the cherry goes on and you're just about to be
hassled by &quot;the man?&quot; No problem, just shove wut ya gots in yo pocketes down
the stash hole an' ledit fall on to the roadway. If you used the type one
parking brake slot you might get away with it but you could almost neva
gidit back. Made the bug smell like patulli oil and vanilla though! =). 
&gt;
&gt;Weak Disclaimer:
&gt;Of course Rusty only read about this kinda behavior in ZAP comix ;) Damn,
those Furry Freak Brothers was funny. For some reason I could ( ahem, I mean
&quot;people I knew of&quot;) could spend hours jus' starin at one page of the comix
an not git bored much less read the same thing twice. Crank on the Chambers
Brothers &quot;Time Has Come Today&quot;, or Beatles Sargent Peppers side two, leave
the little 45rpm &quot;stacking support arm&quot; up an outta da wey soas da needle be
replacin' itsef at the end an' vegout in front of the PDP11 8).
&gt;
&gt;Back then we had an abbreviation for &quot;Rolling on the floor frying my *** off!&quot;
&gt;ROTFFAO %)^   &lt;- Does this count for a &quot;Rustyism&quot;?
