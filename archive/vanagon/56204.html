Subject: Re: 87 Syncro oil/coolant leak

My '87 Florida Vanagon did much worse than DRIP - it PUKED! The seal at the
cooler is made from a compound thatn will crack/break in cold weather. VW
replaced this with a new seal, grey in color, that fixes the problem. Get
thee to a dealer and acquire said part - not THAT hard to put in.

Don't know about your coolant - examine all fittings, heads, hoses, etc.
