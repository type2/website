&gt; but the 67-85 buses CAN retrofit the Cibie Z-Beams or Hella or Bosch 
&gt; halogen replaceable bulb lights, for brighter and better night vision. 
&gt; it ain't cheap and if you break a reflector, it's even less cheap ... 
&gt; but imho it's better  lighting.
&gt;
&gt; however, running that extra ground wire directly from the battery to the
&gt; headlights, even if you keep the old sealed beam lights, can help.

Real headlights?  Wow!  Where can one find these things?
