Not an EE, but I do believe you could buy many of these chargers and link 
them together for more juice. Make yourself a solar-poptop and angle it 
toward the sun in the afternoon. Though JCW has some good gadgets, go to a 
real solar power dealer and discuss a serious system... it will probably be 
cost-prohibitive, but a cool goal to save for?
