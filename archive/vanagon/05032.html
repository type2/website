So Steve Johnson says:
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, so you have a rear wiper, so this tells me that this is a Vanagon of 
&gt; some year.  I'll assume it's water cooled.  I had my blower switch malfunction
&gt; on me one time and they're a pup to fix.  Just pull off the vent control lever
&gt; knobs (gently mind you) then carefully pry out the control face plate.  Now
&gt; you should have access to the heater fan speed switch.  take of the front know,
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That should say: Take off the front knob.  

(Gawd, you'd think I was drunk or something)
