&gt; &gt;them.   I wanna get 2 more, and mount them on the back: one for a backup
&gt; &gt;light, and one for a rear-fog light.

&gt; hmmm. well, you might be able to find a liquid &quot;tint&quot; that you could use to
&gt; &quot;color&quot; the inside of the lens. check with some glass installation shops,
&gt; or some household lighting sellers. also, the rear foglight should have a
&gt; red lens. :) &lt;but you already knew that, right?&gt;

Yes, I had the Hella one on my 911.  I'm going to get a bus center 
brakelight lense to use for the rear fog light.
