Subject: Rear View for runties

For us normally proportioned gnomes (66&quot;) I find that there is no way to adjust
the hanging rearview mirror to give a view of the road contents farther back
than say 50 feet.  If I tip it up I get a fine view of the AC housing bits.

So for us normal folk, anyone over five-six is a mutant BTW, how did your solve
the lookysee through the back window problem?        

For us short folks the snow is always just a little deeper.
