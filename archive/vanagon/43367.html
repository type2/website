Subject: '79 West deluxe FS

Hi Volks,
    I'm storing a '79 Deluxe Westfalia for a friend who has moved to the
big city. (NY)   Its for sale and I'm looking to 'The List' to see if
someone would be interseted.   My wife doesn't like it being here so you
know my problem. Anyway, its a brown deluxe that needs a paint job.  The
body is in really good shape.  Some surface rust but the frame and
undercarrage is rust free.  It has all the deluxe trim, minus the trash
box, parcal trays, pull out blapunkt stereo and radar detector.  The engine
had the top end rebuilt about 30K ago and runs great.  Just passed Mass
state inspection.  Ready to drive home today. Asking 3500 obo. If anyone is
interested or knows someone who might be call me or e-mail me direct, the
info is below.  Help me find a good home for this good bus.  Thanks.
