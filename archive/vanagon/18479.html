Mitch,

I hope you already figured this on out by now.  I installed these same
shocks on my '75 a couple weeks ago.  The ride is great.  

What I imagine happened to you is that the sleeve from the old shocks 
stayed on the stud when you removed them.  Same thing happened to me.
Just grab the sleeve with vice grips and tap the vice grips with a 
hammer to get them off.

Stephen
