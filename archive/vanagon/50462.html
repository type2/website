and Tim Smith questioned...
&gt;Would this be the VW/ZF (OEM) factory, at $800, or the MOOG factory at 
&gt;$280?

The VW/ZF (OEM) factory at $800.

&gt;&gt;simply riveted a metal plate over them rather than fix them.  This and a 
&gt;&gt;cracked windshield are the only real flaws with the camper.

And Tim Smith estimated...
&gt;add $300 or more for new windshield

Over $300 for a windshield?  I suppose perhaps if you bought it from the 
dealer. I got one for my daily driver at a junkyard for $50.


I wrote...
&gt;&gt;The camper currently has 5-spoke 15&quot; aftermarket Vanagon mags that the 
&gt;&gt;previous owner purchased in Germany.  The asking price of $4250 includes 
&gt;&gt;the stock wheels and hubcaps; I would want a little extra for the chrome 
&gt;&gt;wheels, or would sell them separately.

And Tim Smith assumed...
&gt;Of course you would, add another what $500 or so for them..

That would be wonderful, but actually I was thinking more along the lines 
of half that.

In any event, a list member is coming to look at it this weekend, and I've 
had two other inquiries about it since then.  I'll let y'all know if it's 
still available after that.  Basically, I just wanted to set the record 
straight.
