&gt; &gt;I think we in Canada deserve to be broken down by province. How about it.
&gt; &gt;I'm sure most will be in BC, but we're a hard-living, cold driving folk.
&gt; &gt;C'mon joel, please?
&gt; 
&gt; stumble, fumble, toil and grumble, well ... ok. but i'm NOT gonna put out
&gt; the counties for california!!!!
&gt; 

But could you please break it down Northern CA vs. Southern CA?  I didn't
realize it before I moved out here, but there's just as great a division
(emotionally, culturally, politically, etc.) between N. CA and S. CA as
there is between the Deep South and the Yankee North.  The Southern
Californians kind of ignore the &quot;unimportant&quot; Northerners.  The Northerners
dislike the Southerners' water usage, electricity usage, tax revenue
usage, and political power.  I think both regions would rather be living
in separate states.

Whaddya say, Joel?  I'm in the north!
