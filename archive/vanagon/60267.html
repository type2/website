Subject: Re: Awnings

My awning is the Dometic Catalina 2500.  It is a gutter mount that goes 
from the back of the van to the front of the sliding door.   Extends 
about 8 feet and has small plastic pole holders mounted on the side of 
the van.  So when it is set up it is completely free standing. I can 
move the van for optimum shade without taking the awning down.  I 
wouldn't live without it!  Not sure what the 2000 model mentioned in 
this thread is like but I sure like mine.  Set up and take down is a 
breeze once you learn the tricks.
