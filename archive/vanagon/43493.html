Subject: brake line needed

     Hi all,
     On my '66 standard there is a brake line that runs from the top wheel 
     cylinder to the bottom wheel cylinder on each front wheel.  When I 
     recently replaced the backing plates and wheel cylinders I did not 
     place the brake line on the left wheel far enough away from the inner 
     hub of the brake drum and it slowly carved it's way thru the line.  I 
     was lucky and no one was hurt.  Kids, don't let this happen to you! 
     So, now I find myself in need of a left side brake line.  The right 
     side is bent quite differently but maybe rebendable.  No one sells 
     these pre-bent that I can find and I am finding out that i am NO GOOD 
     at bending a straight piece to fit, even with the proper tool.  This 
     line takes an s-curve and needs little turns at each end also.  it's a 
     bitch!
     Does anyone have a good line and fittings intact, preferably from the 
     left side that I can purchase?  Help!
     Ray
