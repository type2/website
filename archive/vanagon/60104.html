&gt;&gt; I'm thinking about replacing my current battery with a Sears Die Hard.
&gt;&gt; A friend of mine told me that it would not fit in my 87 Vanagon saying
&gt;&gt; that it's too big.  I called Sears &amp; they say they have an Die Hard
&gt;&gt; &quot;International&quot; (800 cca/maintenance free) that would fit.  Anything
&gt;&gt; true to it not fitting properly?  And, what sort of life-span should I
&gt;&gt; expect out of it?
