Ok, just confirm, here's the current plan:

The following will all converge at approximately 5 p.m. at the 
Marin Brewing Company in San Rafael, this ocming Friday afternoon -

Ken Bowen                       kenb_at_SIRIUS.COM  in SF
Bradley Magnesium               bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com
Albrecht Jander                 jander_at_hplgauss.hpl.hp_dot_com
Martha Rubin                    nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu


We four will caravan to Gualala, hoping to get a camp space,
preferable within close proximity of one another (make
for better observation of magnesium explosions, etc.  :)

Sometime before Sunday, Al (Al Knoll                        alf_at_hpptc38.rose.hp_dot_com
) will hopefully join us (sorry, formatting problems here).

At about 4 on Saturday, we'll hunt on channel 2 on the CB for
Jim Thompson (busboys_at_aol_dot_com), and all hopefully get adjacent
campsites at the fairgrounds in Lakeport.

On Sunday, hopefully Eugene Palmer (eugp_at_uclink3.berkeley_dot_edu) will
join us, if he's got his engine back in and working again.

Anyone else out there who'd like to join us?

Remember to bring: 

gas
water
ice
wood
neat stuff to burn/explode for Friday nite only
$3 admission fee to the show
$3.50 for 7am Sunday pancake breakfast if you wish
Beer/whatever

See you all there!

If anyone needs to reach me, feel free to phone:  510.376.4321
