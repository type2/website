Subject: H2O Head Cracks

Do small cracks between the exhaust and intake valves need to be welded?
I am getting conflicting advice from my local mechanic and machine shop
and I didn't find much in the archives about this.
The machine shop says there are a lot of cars out there with these cracks
but he doesn't have the expertise to fix the crack. The mechanic says
when the crack gets worse, and the valve seat drops, the piston crunches
the seat and you buy a new engine. Any experiences out there?
