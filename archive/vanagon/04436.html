&gt;Also, the speedometer is off by almost 10 miles/hour - the speedometer
&gt;said 68-70 while I was really going 60. The tire size is
&gt;175/60R14. Any ideas?
 ^^^^^^^^^
This may be your problem with the speedo being off.  That size (which I have
not seen before) will make the speedo go faster due to the smaller diameter.
A bigger tire such as 185-14 or 205/70-14 will bring the speedo back to normal

I have this problem when I run race tires (185/60-13) on the GTI or truck
whenever I autocross them.  It give the impression of going faster than you
really are.
