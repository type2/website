Subject:      80 Vanagon Camper..Whats it worth

I have an 1980 Vanagon Camper 95k miles... No rust, runs good....needs
muffler.  All of the camping pieces of the vehicle work...Fridge, sink,
stove.  I am thinking of selling it, What is it worth?   I would like to
get an older one.  Thanks for your input.
