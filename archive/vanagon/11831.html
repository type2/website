Subject: black smoke pouring out exhaust?!?!

Greetings fellow travellers!
 Well my latest tale of woe for my money pit [85 vanagon gl with
80,000 hard city miles] happened yesterday with my wife driving.
I'd appreciate any guesses about cause and cost for repait
you'd like to make.
 After just a few moments enoromous billowing clouds of oily
blue ish smoke pours out the tailpipe.There's no doubt about the oil in
it-wiping a rag around the tailpipe gave plenty on the rag.
In the cars I've tinkered with, worn rings were common but
i've never seen something happen like this-boom then lots of
oil pouring in the combustion chamber.

Thanks for your opinion !
Bill Layton
