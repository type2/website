Subject: Re: mystery hose

&gt; While checking for the source of a fuel leak by gazing under the front wheel
&gt; wells, I noticed the existence of a grey, 1.75 inch corrugated hose sticking
&gt; down, open on the end, like a drain pipe.  It is longer on one side of the
&gt; vehicle than it is on the other side--both of them are open ended.
&gt; Question: Is this OK, or are they supposed to be connected to something
&gt; behind the wheels?
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 

What year/model is this, I was confused by the existence of such a thing
on the passenger side of the '81 camper, sort of looks like a drain/vent 
for the battery box, but mine has only on the passenger side.  The 
'85 has not and neither did the '86 from my recollection.  I had been 
trying to decide if these were a camper thing or an air cooled thing 
but had forgot about it.  The fuel leak though is likely from the 
overflow lines to the plastic tanks or from the filler, some more 
lines worthy of replacement on all vanagons.
