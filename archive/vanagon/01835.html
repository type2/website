Subject: Re: oil

Yeah, I had the same problem before installing an extra oil cooler in an 
82 westfalia (side mount). The engine was pulling 20 psi at speed prior 
to installation but afterwards oil pressure increased by 10 to 20 psi 
(depending on the air temp.) Now with the oil cooler mounted above the 
tranny, I am thinking of  installing a fan hooked up to an oil temp 
switch.  As David Schwarze said, 20 psi is far tooo low; rule of thumb 10 
psi per 1000 revs. Any ideas out there what might be the source of 
consistently low oil pressure?  DC

By the way I just got back from 10 days in Brussels, and saw a sum total 
of 2 air cooled Vanagons, more than 50 wc vanagons and about 10 pre 80 
busses. The most numerous of all were the Eurovans (transporters). Still 
the Citroens of all vintages remained the most interesting. 

(if you are wondering if I spent my time counting Volkswagens, the answer 
is no, this info comes from walking around the town).

&gt; &gt;20-25 psi?  ack!  15-20 psi?  AACK!  I hope you are not running with that
&gt; &gt;kind of pressure under load on the freeway.  Maybe you are talking about
&gt; &gt;warm idle pressure, yeah, that's it.  
&gt; 
&gt; WARM --OR RATHER HOT--, YES. IDLE, NO. TALKING ABOUT STEADY STATE EQUILIBRIUM
&gt; AFTER AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR AT 60 MPH+. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I'm trying to reassure myself here.
&gt; 
&gt; NOW I'M GETTING NERVOUS.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I get nervous if I have less than 35 psi on the freeway, and I feel all
&gt; &gt;warm and fuzzy inside if that needle stays above 40.  When it drops to 30
&gt; &gt;I stop and have a bite to eat :)  Am I a fanatic about oil pressure?  I
&gt; &gt;don't think so, but if I am, hey, someone let me know and I will shut up.
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT DO THE EXPERTS THINK?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;In the meantime, my oil-related mods are as follows:  VDO pressure and temp
&gt; &gt;gauges,
&gt; 
&gt; MY PRESSURE GAUGE IS A CHEAP NO-NAME BRAND AND I DO HAVE
&gt; SOME DOUBTS
&gt; ABOUT ITS CALIBRATION/ACCURACY. MY POINT, HOWEVER, IS THAT SYNTHETIC
&gt; OIL APPEARS TO HAVE A RATHER STABLE VISCOCITY. ON A COLD ENGINE, BOTH
&gt; OILS GIVE ABOUT THE SAME READING, BUT ONCE WARMED UP, SYNTEC DOESN'T
&gt; DROP AS LOW AS, SAY, 10w-40. tHIS IS NOT A CONTROLLED, SCIENTIFIC
&gt; EXPERIMENT, THOUGH.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Melling high-volume pump, air flaps removed, long gentle warmups.
&gt; &gt;The air flaps in the fan housing in the type IV motor, when open, force the
&gt; &gt;cooling air to do a 180 in order to get to the oil cooler.  I have harped
&gt; &gt;on this before.
&gt; 
&gt; INTERESTING. I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO REMOVE MINE, THOUGH, BECAUSE THE
&gt; WINTERS _DO_ GET QUITE COLD HERE. DO YOU LIVE IN A NICER CLIMATE?  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Whatever type of oil you use, please don't let it get too 
&gt; &gt;hot or dirty!
&gt; HEAT SEEMS UNAVOIDABLE, THAT WHY I USE AN OIL THAT'S LIKELY TO WITHSTAND
&gt; IT BETTER. &gt;
