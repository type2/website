Subject: Re-installing distributer drive gear, T4

Hello! The bus engine is ALMOST done (I know - y'all are sick of hearing
about it).. I am having a problem. The patient - 73 Camper 1800cc. I
finally figgered out where TDc for cylinder 1 was. I slid in the gear.
According to Muir, the gear slot is almost perpindicular the fan housing
(12 degrees counter clockwise from perpendicularity) (is that a word???).
I installed it as such, then slid on the 009. The problem is that the
rotor is now pointing towards (as viewed from above) the 1 or 2 o'clock
position (towards the front passenger's side). As I recall, the rotor
should be at the rear passenger's side (4 - 5 o'clock) What gives????

Thanks!!
Jamie
