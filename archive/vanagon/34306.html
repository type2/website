Subject: 6V Wiper motor specs...

Hey now:

I need the specs for the 6V wiper motor (in my '65 deluxe).  I just 
coverted everything over to 12V and I am going to install a voltage
drop device for the wiper and clock (which is almost werking).  There
are two of these units I can get: A) 


 1.6 Ohm, 4 amp, 25W unit and 
B) 1 Ohm, 6 amp, 35W unit.  Which one do I need?  (Note, these resister-
type voltage drop units - I don't know the correct nomenclature here - can
be hooked up in series or parallel).  Much Thanx,

christian
