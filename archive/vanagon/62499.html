Subject: RE: Parts needed for &quot;Auto Stop&quot; Propane Fill Valve

The Auto Stop fill valve is not the same as the pressure regulator. For some 
time all non-removable LP tanks on vehicles have required an auto-shutoff fill 
valve for good reason - too many accidents when the tanks were overfilled and 
the pressure relief valves later had to vent gas (if they weren't jammed shut 
- then the tank seams could fail).

I don't know which valve was used on the Westy, but there are only a few 
manufacturers. Some used a standard NGT thread connection, some a flanged 
connection. Nothing is really special about the Westy propane system, so any 
good Propane dealer that handles motor fuel or RV service should be able to 
help.

National codes and all states require service to Propane systems be done by a 
trained serviceman - and although I'm a devout D.I.Y.er,  here I agree - I've 
seen too many examples of accidents because someone &quot;fixed&quot; something and 
didn't really understand the system. Often the people injured or killed had 
nothing to do with the homemade fix - they were in the wrong place later. 
While the basic ideas are simple the reasons for some of the features are not 
obvious - many features anticipate &quot;abnormal&quot; conditions that can (and do) 
occur.

&gt;&gt;Does anyone know where to get parts and info on the Auto Stop 80% fill
&gt;&gt;valve on Westy campers?  I think all I need is a diaphragm because when
&gt;&gt;it the tank was filled and the valve shut off I had a gas leak out of
&gt;&gt;the weep hole (vent hole) on the brass casing of the auto stop valve
&gt;&gt;that would not stop.  My van by the way is a 1989 if that makes a
&gt;&gt;difference.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Are these things pretty reliable, or are they a constant headache?  If
&gt;&gt;Auto Stop parts are no longer available, I would appreciate any
&gt;&gt;alternatives to get the system up and operational again.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks as always to the members of the list that make this such a great
&gt;&gt;resource.

&gt;Peter,
&gt;About 7 years ago, I went through the same thing. I replaced it with a
&gt;generic 2 stage regulator. It's been fine ever since.
