Subject: Re: 3rd seat belt for rear
Date: 03 Jul 96 11:08:02 PDT

Hello -
I installed a second seat belt to the same attach points as the 
passenger seat, for use with a childs car seat placed on top of a 
wooden box containing a portapotty.  Probably not legal, but it 
worked while I needed it.  No back support for an adult without a 
real seat though.

I have another seat of unknown origin that I would like 
to install facing back behind the passenger seat, any ideas how to 
raise and install?

I too would like answer to how to/if can install third seat belt in 
rear. (3 kids + spouse)

&gt; I just bought my first Westfalia, a 1984.  Would anybody have experience with
&gt; installing a 3rd seat belt for the rear bench?  Has anyone tried rigging
&gt; something up behind the front passenger seat?
