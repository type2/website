&gt; Should'a seen me trying to fit a timing light AND my face through there to
&gt;see!

yup. it ain't fun. :)

&gt;Now I've noticed two electrical items that don't seem to have any purpose and
&gt;can't find any reference to in any manuel.  On the dashboard, to the left of
&gt;the heater controls (whats to control?:) there is a small, unmarked aluminum
&gt;socket with a wire coming out behind the dash.  I haven't been able to trace
&gt;the wire yet.  Does anyone know what that thing is?

ohmagod, another one!!! :)  well ... i think the consensus is that nobody
knows what the hell that thing is. several others have it, but nobody has
been able to find anything about its use or purpose. suggestions have ranged
from a plug-in seat-heater to plug-in spotlight.

but all the buses that seem to have it are located up along the northwest
area of the u.s. or in western canada (hence the possibility of seat-heater).
