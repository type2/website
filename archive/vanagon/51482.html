Greetings Lotus,

I spend the summers in Denali working for Denali Air and will be returning 
early spring, perhaps for good.  So, as such I undersatand your plight, and 
will help you find one in the lower 48 and send it to you if you wish. 
 Write back if  interested.

Also, there are parts suppliers who post on the net, can't remember the 
sight but if you search using Yahoo or Alta Vista with keywords &quot;Vanagon - 
Parts&quot; something should apper.  If unsuccessful, e - mail me and I'll send 
you a hard copy of mail order parts suppliers.

Did you drive the Alcan with your Vanagon or is it native to the state.  I 
advice for my trip this spring.

Paulo

Someone stripped the oil plug in my '82 Vanagon and I don't want to have it
removed to change the oil until I have a good replacement. NAPA couldn't
find a replacement listed in their book. Does anyone have any good ideas as
to replacing it? There is no VW dealer here ...

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
