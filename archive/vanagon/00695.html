&gt; While we're on the subject, how do people determine how much propane
&gt; they have in their tank? I thought about putting some kind of pressure
&gt; guage in the propane plumbing system so I could monitor usage - until
&gt; then, determining when to refill remains an art...

I got sick of getting the tank topped off before each trip, just to make
sure, so I went out and bought a little pass-through gauge (hi-pressure)
that just screws right into the tank.  It was under $20, if I remember.
You press it in and it gives the current reading.  I am very happy with it!
