Subject: Re: Towing 

I think this Q? came from Frank Condelli, but for those who care, I got a hitch
installed by VW agency, Don Valley VW, at top of Toronto. It is part of the 
bumper frame, bolted to the 'chassis' box beams in place of the bbumper 
mounts. Your standard bumper then gets a small cutout, 1&quot;x2&quot;, to clear the 
towbar, then bolts onto the hitch. Inside the bumper there is now a 
substantial box tube across the back. The  rating was 2200 lbs.,and, I 
think, 200 lbs. tongue weight. This is as big as I woould go with a 4cyl. 
vehicle. Go have a peek at VW, then shop arround, I know nothing about the 
Uhaul stuff.
         I posted this a wwhile back, but ... I was able to tow a 1700 lb. 
Porsche on a 400 lb wheel dolly about 900 miles with no problems, that is 
with an EMPTY '85 vanagon. I've also hauled firewwood in a beatup 
tenttrailer out of wood roads. The vanagon has the Ooomph to do this. BUT 
your brakes aren't strong enouugh to let this additional weight go 
unnoticed, so plann ahead, you've got a good view. 
The kicker on thhis hitch was that it cost me nothing. Sorry, no words of 
wisdom on freebies. I was rear ended by a delivery van, he demoed the bumper 
and an existing bumper hitch, rear lights etc. The old hitch was suspended 
under the engine with 2 sets of rails, 18&quot; apart F/R mounted with cheap 
harrdware onto the sides of the chassis boxes. The hitch looked like a 
pretzle after the hit, it must have been junk anyhow. Soooo.. don't buy one 
of these types!   tjs
  ps. what do you HAVE to tow that won't fit inside one of these splendid 
vehicles anyhow. A bulk buy on manure?, fish? nuclear waste? I only tow when 
desperate/destitute/demented (pick one/all)!!
