Subject: Parts Score, details

I went by today for the second load of stuff.  This one was mostly junk.
The only items of note were some early bug radio bezels, a southwind gas
heater, 2 more early distributors, and some NOS lights and reflectors,
albeit for Toyota, which I promptly gave to one of my neighbors.

Almost all of this stuff went into the dumpster, with the exception of the
above bits.  There's one more load, and I'm almost afraid to go pick it up!
