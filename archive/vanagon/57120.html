&gt;	What is the professional opinion on gas grade.  My manual (88
&gt;Vanagon) says 87 octane is fine.  The guy I bought the vehicle from used
&gt;nothing but premium.  Can I bump it down safely??

well, i'm not a &quot;professional&quot;, but sometimes i play one on TV. :)
in MY experience, with MY 88 bus, with the gas stations in MY area, and
with the way *I* drive MY car ... i have not found any difference in
fuel economy or performance between any of six brands (that i use) nor
between any of the three octanes available hereabouts (87, 89, and 92/93).
the 89 and the 92/93 just cost more. if anyone would like me to, i can
send a little file of the comparison between the brands/octanes for the
125,000 miles i've put on the car so far (fingers crossed, cause wallet
am empty!).

now ... have said the psuedo-scientific stuff, do i run the 89 and 92/93??
sure. why? well ... cause it makes me &quot;feel&quot; better sometimes to do it,
and cause i'm still trying to get an even amount of each brand per octane
through the car. yeah, that's it! i'm &quot;still testing&quot;! :)

seriously, it's YOUR money and YOUR car. you run which brands and which
octanes YOU feel comfortable with. if YOU feel any difference with a
particular brand or octane, and that difference feels &quot;good&quot;, then that's
what you should run. for you. and YOUR car.

or do a &quot;test&quot;, like me. :)
