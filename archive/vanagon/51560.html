Subject: ventilation levers

Ref the 4 ventilation levers in the dash of my '87 Vanagon - how the bloody
heck does one remove them (as in I need to replace the fan switch; yeah, you
can fake it by bending the facia, remove the radio, etc)?  In other VeeWee's
in the past these levers would just pull straight out, but not these!
