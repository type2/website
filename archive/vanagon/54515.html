Subject: Re: Fridge/Pilot light viewfinder question 

Hi Volks,
   I saw a post about how to know if the fridge is working if the
viewfinder is blocked.  Well, the early Dometic had a gauge inside the door
next to the controls,  it looks like a battery check gauge.  When its lite
it should be completely in the green.  Later model had a nice red or green
LED on on the outside near the water level lights. Light on, its working.
Hope this helps.

( Shameless ad here)   LiMBO has aquired a complete 'Dometic Vanagon Camper
Refrigerator' manual.  Has care and feeding instructions, parts list and
illustrations.  Nicely bound photo copies are available for $7.00.
(includes shipping)  Anyone interested can e-mail or send money to the
address below. (end shameless ad)

 Take care.
