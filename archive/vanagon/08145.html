Subject: RE: Upgrade valves on a 2 liter rebuild?

I *like* this time of year.  I have time to read the list and write a bit!

Here's my two cents worth on rebuilding type IVs - if you're replacing the
barrels and pistons go for a big bore kit. Gain a few cubes for no extra bucks
(big bore kits are comparable to the cost of a standard kit).  This is a good
basic mod for two litre engines which are basically 1700s with a longer stroke.
(I run 93mm in my bus with no probs but others have suggested this is a little
over the top - perhaps something a couple of mil smaller?).

If you're having the heads reco'd and new valves fitted (please do and replace
those exhaust valves anyway if you're not) get em to fit valves from an 1800
head which are the biggest standard valves available - (43mm inlet and 34mm(?)
exhaust from memory) - once again better breathing and performance for no extra
cost over what you'd have to spend anyway......if you're handy you could do
some porting and polishing, and its not that hard to 'balance' engine
components either.....

If the exhasut needs replacing go for extractors which are cheaper than the
standard exhaust anyway (here in AUS at least)....

Thats it I think - gain a few HP with no loss of reliability, drivability
(increased I think) or 'extra' cost over normal rebuild...
