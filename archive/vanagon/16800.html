Subject: `66 electrical problems!

I recently went to a wrecking yard and bought a `new' emergency light
relay for my `66. (They're ~75.00 new!) That's the stupid box that goes
under the dash that has 9 connections going to it, is a one-year-only
VW electrical thingie, and, IMHO, is a Bad Idea. 
   Anyway, I put this one in, and--nothing. Nothing at all. (My old one
worked, just smelled like it was going to cause a fire someday.) So, I
put the old one back in; now my turn signals only work when the brake
lights are on! And my brake lights work not at all. I was really careful
about making sure all the wires went back/were put on correctly. Any
insight from anyone? (I have a nice schematic of the system...hmm. Mabey
I just answered my own question.)
