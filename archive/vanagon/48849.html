Subject: Which Oil Filter??

Volks Folks,

Well time has come for the first oil change in the new Vanagon.  I heard a
lot of &quot;Don't use Fram filters&quot; while lurking on the list earlier.  The
question is what brand can I use?  Is &quot;Genuine VW&quot; the only way to go or is
there something else I can use?  All help appreciated.

-Dan
