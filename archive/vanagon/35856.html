Subject: Re: oil filter wrench

&gt;
&gt;For an oil filter wrench try the following:
&gt;
&gt;You can buy a thing that looks like a rather shallow cup. The inside is
&gt;cast (aluminum) to fit the outside of the filter and the bottom has a hex
&gt;to fit a wrench. Take a new filter to your FLAPS and tell them what you
&gt;want. It works well although you do have to push it on and hold while
&gt;getting it started.
&gt;
&gt; ||            || &lt;- Filter fits in the opening
&gt; ||____________||
&gt;       |_| &lt;-Hex 19mm or so.

Sean,

Wal-Mart sells a much better oil filter wrench than the similarly-shaped
aluminum one above.  (I've bought and tried several different types, with
disappointing results, until I found this one.)  It's black and made of
steel.  There should be a display of them so that you can take your oil
filter (FRAM PH2844 for a Type IV or 912/914 engine) and try it before you
buy it to make sure that it fits.  The wrench fits a 3/8&quot; socket extension.

When loosening or tightening the filter, you'll need to clean the outside of
the filter and the inside of the wrench with a rag.  Tap the wrench onto the
filter gently with a hammer, making sure that it seats all around.  Then
insert the socket extension and tighten or loosen.
