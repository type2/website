Subject: Bad host, no E-mail

    NO VW contents

     I haven't recieved E-mail for 3 days. I guess I got kicked off the
     list server because it was being bounced back! My service
     provider, (Nauticon) Claims there system was down for 6 hour.
     This was the first time they admitted to it.
