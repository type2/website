&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It was prominently featured in that movie about Deadheads that came out
last year.  (I unfortunately forget the title.)

&gt;I saw one at both of the memphis shows last year.

i saw a giant school bus with two busses (split windowed) welded on top of
it, this was at a dead show in Charlotte, NC, in 94 (i think)
