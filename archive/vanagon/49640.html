&gt; Sista!
&gt; 
&gt; Hey - I've been a WRECK about the weather over the last 10 days!!! We 
&gt; were showing a BUTT kicker of a storm coming through this week and it 
&gt; was giving me PMS - and since my biological clock has gone south, 
&gt; that's pretty hard to handle!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It might still feel c-c-c-c-old to you dads, but it won't be a full 
&gt; blown winter expedition either.

No worrys Kath...  The thermostat will flip on the heater as needed.  ;)

Martha and all,

Linda and I will probably not make the 'Great Caravan' tonight as my
preparations are behind.  I still might make it, but it looks pretty
doubtful.  Keep your cell phone on Martha!  I want to be able to 
contact you on the road if I need to.

Drive safely everybody!
