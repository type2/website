&gt; 
&gt; Hi: this question is only remotely related to Vanagon interests but since
&gt; there may be electrical engineers/ hi fi experts out there I thought I
&gt; would ask here first. -- 
&gt; 
&gt; The Alpine radio which came with the Westfalia when we bought it has recently
&gt; started acting up. Here are the symptoms:
&gt; 
&gt; a) poor AM pickup across the board - but the rare signals that do come in are
&gt; quite clear.
&gt; 
&gt; b) on FM a low-pitched screeching/howling on frequencies roughly below 93 on
&gt; the
&gt; dial. Sometimes the signal will be reasonably clear at this low end but
&gt; will then revert to the noises after 10-15 minutes run time. Signals above
&gt; this point are good, but there is a slight and faint sound of intereference
&gt; if the volume is turned up. Of the two the FM noise is more problematic and
&gt; annoying.
&gt; 
&gt; I have removed and reinstalled the radio several times to check for proper
&gt; grounding; and solid antennae connection. The radio has  its own power
&gt; source (meaning the line is not shared with other components). The tape
&gt; player works well. The system drives the standard four speaker
&gt; arrangements - two in the doors and two at the back. I recently replaced
&gt; the OEM door speakers with sighly better speakers.

Check the antenna cable/antenna connection, or perhaps try replacing the 
antenna and cable.  This definitely sounds like a poor antenna connection 
to me.  Also, some radios (typically older ones) have an antenna trimmer 
adjustment that tunes the radio to the antenna.  Look for a slotted screw 
type adjustment - probably labelled ANT.  Adjust while listening to a 
weak station.  Otherwise it's probably new radio time.
