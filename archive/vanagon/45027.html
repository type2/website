Subject: Re: more oil temp

        I'll take this under advisement when I get arround to rebuilding my
181.  No, overheating didn't get it, ignition and smog proublens from hell
did.  Now its been sitting so long that the brakes are locked up and I can't
get them to release.
        When I get to the engine I'll probably put on a sump sender like I
have on my '72 camper.
        I do have an oil cooler on the '72 adventure camper, my father and I
put it between the frame rail and the outside rail on the left side, sort of
rearward of where the propane tank would be if it were on the left side (the
propane tank is on the right on my camper).We put on the biggest one that we
could find that would fit it's apx. 1' wide by 2'6&quot; long there is no fan on
it.  It brought down the oil temps' a lot, in fact the proublem that it
caused is that now the camper won't heat up in cold weather.  Next project,
bypass valve.  After the 181.

&gt;&gt;Now this is the Sensor instalation that is useless.  No oil actually flows
&gt;by
&gt;&gt;or near the sensor so the temp reading is actually one of the case and
&gt;&gt;surronding atmosphere.
&gt;
&gt;What Dennis says is true and I found this out the hard way in the mid 70's
&gt;with my '69 Camper - readings were WAY OFF.  In fact the newest VDO Catalog
&gt;now states NOT to use this &quot;T&quot; Fitting (VDO 240 850) for Oil Temp readings as
&gt;the sensor bulb of the VDO 323 057 is not immersed in the oil flow.
