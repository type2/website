Scott asked:
&gt;for those who have one working, does the red water level light
&gt;when there is no water in the tank or must there be some water
&gt;to get it to light?

Don't panic.  None of the work unless there is some water
in the tank to complete the circuit.  I wondered the same thing
when I got my '84.  Put in a couple of gallons and try it again.
