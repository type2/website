Howdy, all..

Thought I’d share a hair-raising experience I had this morning on the way to
work...Left home with about 3/4 tank of gas, 10 miles later was about halfway
to work when I started smelling gas.  Checked the fuel gauge, which read just
above half a tank, so I thought, well, maybe I looked at it wrong when I left
this morning.  Surely, I couldn’t have burned up several gallons in just 10
miles.  Traffic was stop-n-go, so it took me about 4-5 minutes to get about 2
miles further.  Gas smell now much stronger.  Uh-oh...vividly recall the many
horror stories I’d read about busses engulfed in flames.  Checked the fuel
gauge again, it now reads between 1/2 and 1/4 tank.  In just two miles, I’d
consumed almost 1/4 tank.  Checked the rearview mirrors, both for space to
pull over, and to check the road for leaking petrol.  No petrol apparent.
 Pulled over and shut the engine off immediately.  (BTW, temp is 12, wind
chill is -3.  Fahrenheit).  popped the back lid, but no gas anywhere.  Hmm.
 Can’t even smell the gas from back here.  Hmm.  Look under bus on
passenger’s side, and smell of gas is very strong, but no evidence of any
leaking.  Fingers are now numb, I’m in my best suit, so (I know, I know), I
call AAA to my rescue.  I suspect a leak in the gas line between the pump and
the engine, but was too cold to investigate further.  Will let you all know
what the problem was when it gets figgered out.
