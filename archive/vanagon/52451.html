&lt;&lt; Now I don't know what state &quot;not secured to the front seat&quot; defines,
 but if it means the seat was not attached by ANY means, or improperly
 attached (wrong belt through wrong anchor points) then I find it very
 hard to sympathize w/ the little girl's mother because the bottom line
 is that parents are ultimately responsible for their charges.  I mean,
 we drive around w/ a 2yr. old in the front seat of both our A2 Jetta
 and EV, but this incident is not going to change the seating arrange-
 ment anytime soon. &gt;&gt;

With all that we know,  why would anyone place additional risk on thier
children by placing them in the front seat?  Barely makes sense if there are
no seats left in rear.
