&gt; The carpet has withstood mud, puke (10 year old, non alcohol induced),
&gt; sand, etc..etc...  A little rug cleaner once in a while and its
&gt; nice and clean!

The above are sort of the reasons for the clear, rubber matting
I used.  It removes very easy to dump the sand after a day of
scuba diving or surfing, wipes clean from Calvin (my Golden
Retriever) drooling during RT's (road trips), and something
all of us can relate to, when your master brake cylinder begins
leaking like my did a year ago.  The fluid wipes up easily from
the matting better than it would from carpet!
