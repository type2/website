I hear you loud and clear. HOWEVER, if you are familiar with the list
people's names, you could easily pick them out of the larger list, *when*
you have a choice.

Now, parenthetically: last night I attended the monthly meeting of the
local VW club. Nice bunch of people, although I did not experience the
warm fuzziness of pizza-eating, Pfeiffer &amp; Red Rock-camping,
flannel-talking, and Joel-admiring vanagon-listers. I guess, if there is
one way to stereotype the differences, it would be in the groups'
representative preference ordering between flannel and bikini strings. :)
