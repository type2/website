On the advice of several listpeople, I ran a little oil down the
cable and in the back of the speedo.  I used a small screwdriver and spun
the speedo a bit, and it eventually looseded up somewhat.

Put it all back together, and its still jumping all over the place, but
the squeal is gone.  The cable still wobbles violently, though.  I
guess I'll have to replace that.
