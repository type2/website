Subject: RE: FOLLOWUP: Squeaky/Creaky Vanagon Suspension

I've not had any luck getting lubricant onto my suspension bushings either.
Let's escalate:  Can anyone do a short recap of what I'll need to have/do
in order to replace, or just expose to lubricate, the bushings.

I have a wrench; I'd jump right in except for (1) how to restore the camber
adjustment and (2) that big spring waiting to launch me and my wrench thru
the passenger seat.

Thanks for any guidance.
B.
