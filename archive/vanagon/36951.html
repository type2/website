 I posted this a week ago, but recieved no replys.  Anybody know about
this stuff?

I am assessing the future of the bus, and want to know what to think of
emerging rust along seam, driver side.  This is the seam that joins the
panels holding the middle and rear windows.  Rust discoloration is starting
to show up about two thirds of the way up, and a bubbling rust spot the size
of a dime has emerged about a foot up the bus.  The rear corner panel was hit
and needs to be replaced also.  On passenger side, this same problem occurs
between the corner panel, and the rearward window panel.  Also noticing
cracks in seam along seam to the rear of the driver's door (B pillar?).  Is
this where the water enters causing the rust, or is this crack caused by
interior rust pushing out?

Other rust is on the front body panel that disappears under the top of the
front bumper.  Again, a small patch.

The sliding door track(exterior) has peeling paint and rust, visible if you
look up under the guard panel.  The functional part of the track does not
seem to be rusty when I checked by feel.

The entire undercarriage (coated by dealer) is rust free. (also no rust under
camper accy. panels)

What is the fix for this rust?

Thanks

Peter and Zippy
