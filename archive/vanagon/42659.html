Subject: Re[2]: Exhaust Repair Bummer


     I wanted to do this this weekend but neither Orchard Supply or Home
     Depot have M8 x 1.25 metric nuts in stainless (or any metric
     stainless). Does anyone know of a source near the Pasadena/Glendale CA
     area.

     Thanks,
     Jeff


Jeff,

Look in Yellow Pages under Fasteners...  Gotta be about a zillion places in LA.
