 I do not know if I'm even asking the right person but if for 
some reason I'm not would you please forward this messege to the 
correct person. 

   I have run accross a case that something was poured into a 
radiator and now it is completely stopped up. I know some of the 
products like block seal and stop leak are no compatible with
antifreeze. When these items mixe what happens. My theory at this 
point is that they blew a head gasket and poured something in 
there to stop the leak and it did not react well with anti-freeze 
and stopped up the radiator. So will the sealing products that 
are not compatiable with antifreeze cause something like this ?


 Please e-mail any help you can give me at broberts_at_plano_dot_net
