Subject:       light switch illumination

Howdy folks.  I took out the van last night for some exercise and 
noticed that it was pretty dark where the light switch is located.  I 
don't drive the van that much at night, and my panel lights are 
turned off.  I have the daytime running lights (Canadian model), and 
usually never have to use the light switch as the lights are on all 
the time (park/tail/headlights) anyway.  So, when I cranked up the 
rheostat, all the panel lights came on except the light switch.  The 
rear defogger switch, and hazard switch lights up.  Even the light 
switch in our Golf lights up.

Could someone be kind a enough to make a check the next time out at 
night to see if this switch lights up for me?  Appreciate any 
feedback.

Cheers,
Harry.
