&gt;
&gt; According to the VW owners manual, the vanagon uses DOT 4 break fluid.
&gt;  However, I seem to only find DOT3 and some places I have taken my &quot;Baby
&gt; Blue Whale&quot; to tend look at me crazy when I mention DOT4.
&gt;  -What are the effects of using DOT3 instead of DOT4?
    Warning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        DOT 4 ONLY

   On a hot day your brake will (with dot 3) boil the fluid. This is
   like have air in the lines. Then instantly, no brakes.
