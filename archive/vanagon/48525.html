    You guys are going to love this one!

    I started down a steep, paved hill, in creeper gear. As the gears 
    started to wind up I thru in the clutch to shift from creeper 
    gear to second or third. Before I had a chance to get it out 
    of gear, I was slammed against the dash as one of the rear wheels 
    must of locked!     Left 25 feet of rubber on the road!
    (Maybe If I had a chance to get my seatbelt on
    I would have known more of what had happen). When The Van was 
    almost at a stop, I got off the dash and back in to the driver 
    seat and pulled it out of low, drifted to the bottom of the hill. 
    At that time I reallized the clutch was not dissengaging. 
    Couldn't get it into any gear. Obviously there was a major failure
    in the clutch! MY question, is there damage to the transmission?
    I have to take it out anyway, how can I check it out?

             Thanks for Your info a head of time!

    P.S. Removed the clutch disk late last night. The G forces
            Ripped it apart!
