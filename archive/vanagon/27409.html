&gt; Pacifica seems like a great idea. Anyone know a good place to camp
&gt; there?
&gt; 

Just south of Pacifica, past Devil's Slide, there are some turnouts -
parking lots for beach access down the cliff - where the San Mateo
County sherrif probably won't hassle us.  On the other hand, if you go
another 20 min south, there're more state beaches with *official*
camping - like the one (San Gregorio?) right outside of Pescadero.
Pescadero has that cool market/bakery with the killer garlic bread, and
there's always Duarte's for artichoke soup...

Then again, we could meet at Big Basin, but there's not much surf
there... :)
