Subject: new van, inspect'n &amp; warrnty questions

I may be soon moving from wannabus to '86 syncro camper. I understand 
that the engine has about 20K on a rebuild and the trans has been done 
too.  I don't know what it needed or what was done.  Total miles ~= 110K.

I have a question about extended warranties and this vehicle.  I am going
to have it inspected by a mechanic today or this weekend to check on cv
joints, water pump, heads, trans, etc.  I have the opportunity to get a
warranty called 'Flextech 1' (sp?) that would cover engine, drivetrain,
electrical, steering, AC for 18 mo.  for $1K.  In your option, is this
recommended?  How much can an inspection uncover about (un)expected and
expensive problems?  This list has warned me in the past about $$$$$ 
maintenance. 

I'll have to pay closer attention to the syncro bits on this list. TIA for 
your advice.
