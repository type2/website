&gt;Last night my wife and I were returning from an errand in the '83 Vanagon

&gt;with what appeared to be a non poptop fiberglass top that had to be two feet
&gt;taller than the standard Vanagon Westy top. The top was the same outside

very likely it's an Adventurewagen, made up in Ft. Bragg, California.

of course, it couldn have been an import from germany ... westfalia and
