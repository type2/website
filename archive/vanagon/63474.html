Subject: Re: removing radiator

I need to do exactly the same thing (need to replace the radiator on our

&gt;Has anyone dropped the radiator out of an 89 vanagon with air conditioning.
&gt;I have'nt seriously tried it yet, but the two freon lines running
&gt;underneath the the radiator appear to have it stopped from dropping
&gt;straight down. Do these lines have to be removed or is there room to jockey
&gt;the radiator around them?
