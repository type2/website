&gt;1. your life will be millions of times easier if you get the little hand
&gt;pump that attaches to the mouth of the trans. oil bottle. 

Yes, do it! I couldn't get a 'transfer pump' from my FLAPS for less than $25Cdn.

&gt;2. Bugpack makes a 17mm hex head that fits on a standard 3/8&quot; ratchet.
&gt;Another great thing.

No room for more than an open end wrench if you leave the Syncro skid plate 
on, hence the cheap fix I used. Fill plug is easy!   tim s.
