&gt;Today I noticed a small amount of oil floating in the overflow tank 
&gt;of my '87 Vanagon. I checked the other coolant tank and it was 
&gt;clean as a whistle. Should I panic?. Thanks for your help.

Which coolant tank?  If oil is getting into cooling system,  95 percent
chance the oil cooler is bad.  Have it tested.  Replace if needed.  This do
fail occaisionally.  Especially in winter due to high oil pressuer at
start-up.
