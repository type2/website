Michael: sorry this didn't get to you.

&gt;some of my friends are thinking about going to BBTA. Do you know if it is
&gt;possible to reserve a camping spot, or how one might go about doing that?

Hi Michael,

No, there is no reservation possible if your friends decide to camp on
BBTA ground. If they come days early, they could off course still stay at
this campground, but note that the daily charge will be $15. The $10 per
night charge is a BBTA special. Still I doubt that a reservation would be
necessary. 

If your friends come late, they may not get the best *spots*, but they
will definitely have no problem finding a spot at all. Camping at BBTA is
(or at least used to be) freeform. 

If they decide to go, they should try to find me. My license plate is
P8M-984. It's a greenish yellow breadloaf. Note, though, that I may not be
there for the whole event and quite possibly may only visit for an
afternoon. Too many work-related deadlines... :-(

Cherokee Lakes Campground's phone number is (314) 978-2147.

Sami
