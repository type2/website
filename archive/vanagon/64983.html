 SyncroBeast           S&amp;S Headers, an update
Thank you David B.  I called S&amp;S Headers and got their web address, and talked
to Betty for a while.  Nice lady.  Nice shop.  Here's some more details for
those interested.

S&amp;S Headers
http://www.ssheaders_dot_com/
6042 N 53rd Drive
Glendale AZ    85301-7775
602-847-9000

Betty offered a 5% discount to list members, and asked if a member needed to
recomend them to the list, or could they just pop on and say hi.  I told her
to pop on and say hi, so look for a message from them sometime in the future.

They make headers and mufflers for all waterboxers, and are familiar with
differences between 83-84, 85, 86 on, (I may not have the years correct, but
they were aware of the differences)

On a subject near and dear to me, SyncroBeast, they were not sure if there
pipes fit the Syncro or not.  They are still checking this out, with luck,
maybe they will.  (Please don't e-mail to tell me the Syncro pipe curves up, I
know)

Maybe one of the list admin's/moderators could talk to them and clue them
about protocal and etiquette??  (umm, Chris - Coyote)  She did offer a 5%
discount to us.
