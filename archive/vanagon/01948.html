&gt;In my '84 Vanagon the lights behind the speedometer and heating

&gt;Anybody have any suggestions before I dig into this?

try wiggling the little thumb-wheel on the headlight switch. this went out
on me in my 1980 bus, and i had to replace the whole switch. but if the
clock/fuel gauge side is lit up nicely, you might have a break in the
little foil circuit thingie inside the instrument pod (that floppy circuit
foil that you see when you pop the top of the pod).
