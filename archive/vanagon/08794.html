I managed to waddle in to work for a minute today, I promise I will not

&gt; Hate to object to this, but here's a minor point: all the hormones in the 
&gt; turkey are actually digested by the time they get into your blood -- they
&gt; are just broken down into the four amino acids, just as any other protein
&gt; molecule that you eat...
