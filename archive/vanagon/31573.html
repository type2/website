Subject: Re: Splitting a TI Case and RearEngineMountBolts: CAUTION!

To Brian and the list:

Using a ball-type valve in place of the stock plunger did not originate with
me.  

Ball-valves are pretty much an industry standard for oil pressure relief
valves on American engines.  Volkswagen's piston-valve was a mystery the
first time I saw one, until we understood that the oil flow was being forced
to turn a corner, making it difficult to use a ball valve.  

The ball-valve conversion is usually applied to the FORWARD oil control
valve, that is, the one nearest the flywheel.  The oil pressure relief ports
into the valve gear gallery are blocked off and the plunger is removed from
the rear valve's bore.  This of course defeats the purpose of the rear valve,
which served to direct oil to the cooler when the engine was hot.  

With the oil pressure relief ports blocked, leaving the plunger in place can
put excessive pressure across the stock oil cooler, more pressure than is
safe with the old up-right coolers, although the new style dog-house types
seem to handle it okay.  In either case, engines having the ball-valve
conversion usually run hydraulic valves which dictates the need for a
full-flow oil filter, and having gone that far it is common practice to
provide for an external cooler as well.

Any time external plumbing is added to the lubrication system of the Type I
engine, I've found it wise to include an oil pressure relief valve at the
pump.  This is easily accomplished by using the Gene Berg pump cover having
an in-built pressure relief valve, which is of course a ball-valve :-)
