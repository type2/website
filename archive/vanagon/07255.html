&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Currently in the Wannabus status,  but I must say that I Haddabus, 1967, 
&gt;&gt; for several years while I was living in San Francisco, CA.  I drove it 
&gt;&gt; everywhere, including the Mojave (without ac in summer) with only minor 
&gt;
&gt;Why would anyone assume you had AC in a '67?!  ;)

&gt;From '49 thru '67, all transporters came stock with 2-60 air conditioning.
