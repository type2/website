Subject: web page update

        Dean Anderson, the king of beat up busses with cut-up wheel wells,
etc, was gracious enuf to supply me with the new contender for the Hall of
Shame &quot;Bus Of the Month&quot;  - http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/shame.html  
        
        I've also added a cool pic to the miscellaneous pictures page, of a
baby elephant loaded onto the back of a single cab, complete with semaphores
and safaris!  - http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/misc_pix.html
