Subject: Return addresses in MSMAIL


For those of you using Microsoft Mail on PCs, It has just been
pointed out to me how to keep the mailer from stripping away all that
useful return-address information etc., that it normally does.

Go into your MSMAIL.INI file in your WINDOWS directory. In the
section headed [MSMAIL], insert the following line:

    StripGatewayHeaders=0

It worked for me. Hallelujah! Now my message all have the complete
return addresses, transfer/bounce messages, etc.

This is only for MS-DOS machines running Microsoft Mail under Windows.

ENjoy!
