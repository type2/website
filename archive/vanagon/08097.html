For what it's worth ...

In article &lt;D0rwAE.8ID_at_unx.sas_dot_com&gt;, sasbsb_at_butler.unx.sas_dot_com (Bryan Butler) writes:

This is one of the old classics.

The engine runs, but the transmission is not working.  Not
sure why because I haven't had time to work on it.  It does
run well, and can be driven, but probably not far.  It is
mainly a parts car, with a good engine.

Please call 821-7395 for more info our to check it out.
