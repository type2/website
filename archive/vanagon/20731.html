: I'm also having trouble getting the idle right...actually, I can't get it
: to idle at all. I've gone through the carb rebuild, checked points and
: plugs, checked intake boots for cracks (visually), etc.

Try the lower butterfly on the 34PICT carb.  Spray a burst of carb cleaner
and see it the idle smooths out.  If it does, get a new carb.  Since new 
34PICTs are rare and expensive, as well as a source of many hesitation
problems, I have used the 30/31PICTs with an adapter base with good success.
