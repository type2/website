&gt;  I have a seven passenger Syncro for sale.  Here's a list of work that
&gt;has been done
&gt;within the last month preparing it for sale;
&gt;
&gt;  Head Gaskets
&gt;  Front Axles
&gt;  Rear Brakes With Drums
&gt;  Front brakes with Rotors
&gt;  Complete tune-up
&gt;
&gt;  Asking $6200.00
&gt;
&gt;  I bought this van to part-out, it turned out to run so well and not look
&gt;that bad
&gt;that I decided to keep it in one piece.
&gt;
&gt;  This van runs very well.  It has been in a Hail Storm and has suffered
&gt;some dings.
&gt;This van would be a great van for someone living in the Mountains or city
&gt;that needs a
&gt;Syncro and doesn't want to worry about every nick and scratch.


I was at Volks cafe and saw this van about 3 weeks ago. It looked a lot
nicer than Kyle makes it sound. He and Peter(the owner of Volks Cafe) kept
telling me it looks worse in different light, but I couldn't see it. I
thought that this was a really nice van, and a bargain. If i had any
interest in Syncros(or any money for that matter, or room for more vans)
I'd grab it. I'm surprised Kyle still has it, and someone who is after a
syncro should take a serious look at it. They had several other bargains
there also. I'm not being a schill for Kyle here, I'm just a satisfied
customer of his who thinks someone should grab this van.
