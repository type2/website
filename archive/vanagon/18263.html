Subject: Newbie here!

Hi!
Just thought I'd introduce myself instead of lurking around in the 
background. My girlfriend and I own a 72 Westie, which I am currently 
restoring to tiptop shape--without taking all the fun out of it.

We've recently moved to Edmonton, Alberta, and we've had the opportunity 
to take Marlene (our westie), as well as our two dogs,  to the Rockies for 
some camping.

Looking forward to learning (and even maybe helping out) from all of you, 

Peter.
