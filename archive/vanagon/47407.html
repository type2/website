Subject: Re: Vanagon advice needed

Jim: As a recent Vanagon purchaser, it could be that folks don't wanta 
buy a car that needs work, no matter how cheap.  Might be worth your 
while to get it running and go back to your original price, which sounds 
awfully good (for a good beast).  Seems that a fixer-upper seems most 
attractive to one who can do that cheap for own use or resale, and it 
seems they aren't biting at the moment. Cheers, Art McGinn
