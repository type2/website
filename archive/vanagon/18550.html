Subject:       Re: Speedometer

&gt; On departure from the GNATT gang I became conerned that my speedometer 
&gt; was not right (having been informed so by Dave Schwarze), so I checked it 
&gt; with a stopwatch and an attempt and a steady speed. I determined that 
&gt; when it was reading 65 I was really going about 57 and when it was 
&gt; reading 70 I was really going 62.  Now I know why I've been getting good 
&gt; mileage, why the engine has lasted so well and why it always seems like 
&gt; it takes us so long to get there.  
&gt; 
&gt; So. Can someone tell me if there's any way the cable or the EGR box could 
&gt; be causing this, or is it most certainly the speedometer itself?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help.

Gerry,

I have the same problem on my '67.  It is running about the same as 
yours is.  Passengers always wonder why we are being passed so much 
when my speedometer says 70!  &lt;g&gt;

I originally suspected that my speedo was off because I have 15&quot; 
wheels on the bus, but after considering it, my speedo should show 
lower than the actual speed. 

Anyhow, I still sit here wondering what is wrong with it?  I just 
remember that I am going 10MPH less than I think...  

When I purchased my '57 I was amused to find out that it has the 
opposite problem.  When you are on the freeway, it says you're going 
about 20MPH.

Well, it used to.  On a trip to Moab the speedo made a nasty noise, 
and then suddenly the speedo quit.  But the odomoter still works!  
Crazy crazy.

Well, enough rambling from me.  Do you have different size 
wheels/tires?
