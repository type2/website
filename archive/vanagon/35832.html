Subject: It RUNS!!!!

Yo folks, just wanted to announce the reconstitution and
resuscitation of my 2.0L '81 Vanagon motor.  After a total
tear-down, dispersion of various parts across the continent,
followed by gradual reassembly in my bedroom, it started on the
first turn of the key.

This lucky engine received:

* new pistons/cylinders (Hoy Fox, TX)
* reconditiond crank and rods (Temple's Maschine, UT -- never again)
* reconditioned cam and lifters (Weber, CA)
* balancing (Granger Supply, SLC UT)
* head rebuilding (Mark Stephens, CA)
* all new motor mounts (Vee Dub Parts Unlimited, CA)
* new engine-compartment gasket (VDPU)
* loads of pretty black paint, in various shades of matte and gloss
* (almost) all new vacuum and fuel-line hoses
* many other amenities...

All I can say is: wow!

Thanks for all the suggestions from you folks, I wouldn't
have been able to do half as good a job without your help.

Special thanks to Bob Hoover, William Kennedey, David Schwarze,
Jack Reed, John Anderson, Joel Walker, Harvey Chao, Dave Kautz,
Bob Park, J. Stutsman, Alan H. Kirk, Tim Smith, and locally
Clay Perry.
