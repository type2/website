Jim, and everyone else for that matter...


I'm going to try to make it to B&amp;Js...I have a 6 pack left of &quot;Transporter 
Ale&quot;....Jim Kirk and I wiped out a couple of bottles when he stopped by here 
on his semi-illfated &quot;loose head sensor&quot; road trip....

Tomorrow I'm leaving for an 8 day trip to Italy (Milano and Torino) and 
France (Grenoble ... again). Back in January I made arangements for
the University and a bunch of small, start-up hight tech firms to get a 
booth at a tradeshow called &quot;Meeting Point&quot; in Torino....and got rewarded 
with a trip to the show! Besides.....I needed to get back to Italy because 
I've yet to get a T4 brochure in Italian! I also have to pick up another 
EuroVan rear fog light or two.  

As Jim pointed out, the B&amp;J show is a great opportunity for an East Coast 
gathering...hope to see lots of V_at_L folks there....

BTW, Jim...how did the meeting at VWUS go?

Ric
