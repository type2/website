Me too!

Thanks for the info Joe! The Der Wagonwerks people seemed very nice too.

BTW, he said he only has a couple left.

&gt; I just talked to Bill at Der Wagonwerks and ordered my tape. He's got a
few
&gt; left. Cost 12.00 plus 4.43 shipping. These are the same folks whose flier
&gt; for the Muir t-shirts came with my NEATO subscription info (thanks, Dave,
I
&gt; sent my membership dues  today too), so I ordered a t-shirt for my wife's
&gt; birthday.
