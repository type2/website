Subject:  91 Vanagon has rattle comming from front wheel

I have a 91 Vanagon and now am getting a rattle (cyclic) sound from the 
right front wheel at low speeds...Its very prevelant when I take a slow right
turn or after I hit the break and let up. Its kind of a tink-tink-tink sound...
Could it be my break calipers, CV joints or wheelbearings???
I had the rotors replaced within the last 5k miles...pads too....

Thanks in advance John
