&gt; Otherwise, why would the rings go on one cylinder only??  Not impossible, 
&gt; but how likely?
&gt; &gt;Dear VWers,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I measured the compression on my cyclinders as follows:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1- 40, 2- 126, 3-120, 4-130.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does it make sense to just repair cyl #1? i.e. change the piston, rings,
&gt; &gt;valves,... on cyl #1, or one has to do the whole set?

I would imagine burnt valve as well which could be done alone if
you really really needed but should say once Dad lost rings in just
#3 on his '65 and replaced just that piston and cylinder which
proved neccesary, the Bentley manual says you can do this, he put
another 50,000 on it before selling.
