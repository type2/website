Subject: RE: '83 vs. '77


&gt;Should I sell off my '83 GL and pick up the Westy?  Or will I just be
&gt;looking for a Chevy motor to get the power back?

Try a Ford instead. The Chevy 2.8L has weird balance characteristics that
make it hard to track down vibration problems if you ever have any. I know
they're smooth in Citations and Celebrity's, but if something goes wrong
and you start getting vibrations, it's hard to prove they're NOT the
result of putting the engine where it doesn't belong. The Chevy 2.8L
is designed to be integrated into a certain drivetrain. Put it anywhere
else, and you're on your own. The Ford V6's I've heard of, don't have
this problem.


&gt;All opinions are welcomed.

That one too?   :^)
