Subject:      I want your tent!!!!

     PLEASE!!!

     And now my campaign promise.

     If elected (to purchase the tent), I will embark on an extensive quest
     to have the tent duplicated at cost for any and all list members who
     may be interested and to have the design modified to work with
     Vanagons, et al.  I will further attempt to ensure that such
     duplication include the necessary hardware, poles, etc., to make it
     usable.

     This I do solemly affirm.

     -Blaine Bachman
     Candidate for Owner, drive-away tent.

     Any votes?
