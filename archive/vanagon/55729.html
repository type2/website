Does anyone know how to adjust the timing on an 85 Vanagon (Digijet). 
I have the Bentley manual, but can't find an actual description of the
adjustment, just a measurement of the timing.  Is is simply rotating the
distributer or is it done through the CPU?  The use of a timing light is
described so I assume there is a mechanical adjustment.  Anyone know?

 Thanks,
	James
