&gt;Joel, or anybody: is there any reason this would not work on an 82 or

&gt;reasonable to suspect the pot? TIA - DC

from my experience with my 80 bus, i'd suspect some other part for that
loss of power ... since your L-jetronic EFI is analog, not digitally
susceptible to &quot;morse-code&quot; from the potentiometer (like the Digifant).

one way to be more certain would be to find someone with a similar bus and
swap the whole air-flow meter for a couple of hours.
