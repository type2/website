Subject:      86 syncro for sale

i forget who was looking for a non-camper syncro, but that number that
i posted about the 86 was flat wrong in the vwcoa ad!

however, after great effort and straining of the little grey cells, i
found the original ads in the LiMBO newsletter for jan/feb 1995. the
correct number should be (502) 538-4322 for the 86 syncro. and it IS
in kentucky.

at least according to THAT ad. ? :)
