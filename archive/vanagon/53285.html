Subject: 83 Westy knocking sound

I inherited an 83 Westy, air-cooled, usa-can model from my father six years
ago. It is a wonderful vehicle. But for two or three years now, it has a
knock coming from the rear, and seemingly more from the left rear. I have had
two mechanics check out a wheel bearing or cv failure, but they both said
they were o.k. It has 68,000 miles. Sometimes I will drive it 20 miles and
not hear it, then another trip will bring out the knock, which seems louder
under load. Turning right or left does not seem to make a difference in the
sound. 
Any suggestions to help me find and correct this will be greatly appreciated.
