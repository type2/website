&gt; I would think that in a &quot;Camper/Van&quot;,  you should probably give up any dreams
&gt; of Porche-Like handling....  My trick is to set a few uncherished things on
&gt; the cooking center top,  when they start to slide and fall off, it warns me
&gt; that I'm exceeding the design limits of Camper cornering.

Curt and others,
I know our Vanagons don't exactly handle like Porsches, but I am VERY
impressed at the way my '81 handles and rides.  If you've ever driven an
'85 Dodge Ram Van then you know how bad it can be.  Super floaty ride
(like you're out on the high seas), unbelievably heavy clutch (yes, my
dad special ordered that van with a 4-on-the-floor), shifter that you
can't reach and is nowhere near a natural position, steering with about
a quarter turn of play in it on each side and WAY overboosted -- you
could turn the wheel with your pinky.  I HATE that.  And it's always
been like that!  It does have good brakes, though.

Anyway, I really like the way the Vanagon Westy handles, mine is great!
It's better than some cars.  It's definitely better than the old Buses.
I've got Michelin XZX tires on it, inflated to the proper pressures, KYB
Gas-A-Just shocks, and the nice rack-and-pinion non-power steering (yes,
I actually like not having power steering, the steering feel on my
Vanagon is absolutely great), A clutch that a normal human can easily
push on, a nice long shifter that's right where it should be, etc, and
best of all, really comfortable seats :-) .  

I think VW did a hell of a job as far as the handling aspect of the
Vanagon goes.  

Sean
