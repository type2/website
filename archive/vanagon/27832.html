Subject: Hydraulic to solid lifters?
Date: Tue, 31 Oct 95 22:56:52 EST

OK you all want to talk noisy lifters, well the '78 is terrible
upon starting in the morning major MAJOR clacking from one on
each side of engine.  I've thouroughly dissasembled and cleaned each of
them all will hold pressure bench bled with cold thick oil, but after
running the hot oil bleeds out and each morning major clattering, will
persist for even 15 minutes or so, and even after the 2 terrible ones
stop, on sudden engine decelleration a light clatter ensues.  Now I know
that upon shut down 4 of them will  only stay pumped up for about 5-10
minutes, I've felt them while following an adjustment procedure
reccomended by Stephens Machining, letting her run from cold 2 minutes,
adjusting them all out to .006, running 2 more minutes then adjusting
all 1.5 turns past contact.  An OK procedure if they stay pmped up long
enough to do the adjustment.  Instead I dissasembled em all, cleaned,
bled, reassembled cold and adjusted 2 turns past contact, still my
problems, so as I don't think 15 minutes of valve train slamming is
good (sounds like way loose adjustment, must be .02 or more until they
pump up)  I need a solution.  However at $12.95 each I hate to replace
all 4 that get soft and I cant really tell which 2 are the worst.  Plus
with 137k on the engine, putting in $50 of new lifters, that I might
just lose if she throws a rod and terminates the case as you aren't
supposed to use em in different bores, isn't appealing.  Enter solid
lifters, $2.95 each, hell I can do all 8, and valve adjustments don't
scare me.  Now I know they went to steel pushrods for the hydraulics,
but did the length change? did the cam change? can I do this, I know
people go the other way.  Is this a stupid ides?

Comments, suggestions, etc wanted (particularly some nice etc)

'78 Westy Virginia (running so nice she need to run quiet)
'90 Corrado G60 (go figure liter noise starting here as well
                 and she's had Mobil 1 every 5000 miles with
                 genuine VW filter.  VW can't build hydraulic
                 lifters for shit)
