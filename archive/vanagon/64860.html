Having just returned, I can assure you that a Bus Village at Burning Man
would be redundant: Black Rock City was completely infested with VW buses
of every kind and pedigree (including a stretched bus that I didn't get a
chance to look very closely at).

&gt;Please email me if you're interested in this project and in attending
&gt;Burningman on Labor Day weekend, 1998.

I'll be back.  Sign me up!
