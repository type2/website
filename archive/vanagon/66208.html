&gt; I love looking for Vanagons, so if anyone wants me to check out a
&gt; vehicle for them, let me know.

I live near San Francisco but am definately open to looking anywhere
vaguely nearby in or out of CA (I was recently considering vans
in Colorado &amp; Arizona)

What I'm seeking is a '88-'91 moderately-milaged (under 100K)
Syncro AdventureWagen (which is a Vanagon with a non-Westfalia camper
conversion)

I'll even consider offering a finder's fee of chocolate chip cookies....

Thanks for any pointers,

Stephen
