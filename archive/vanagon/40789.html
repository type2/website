Subject: RE: loss of power on hills


&gt; I have no experience with Type-4 engines. But if I had this happen to
&gt; an older baywindow bus with a type-1 engine, the first place I'd look
&gt; would be the distributor. Specifically, the centrifugal-advance
&gt; mechanism.
&gt;

I been staying out of this thread for lack of knowledge, but this post by
Steve makes a lot of sense.  I now know a bit from hooking and unhooking
the vacuum lines during my transplant.  From what I remember from the
Bentley man (sitting on my desk at home), the late FI busses get *no*
advance til (a) some outrageously high RPM as sensed by some of those
little vacuum hoses, and (b) 4th gear is engaged.  Then it gets a fair
amount all at once (if I remember correctly).  Make sure the skinny vac
hoses are all plugged in correctly.  If that doesn't help, look in the
Bentley on the distributor.


&gt;
&gt; If it were me, I'd do the following:
&gt;

&lt;really nice procedure deleted&gt;

I like the procedure, but I would advise reading the bentley first, as the
advance mechanism is completely different in the FI busses.

BTW, Steve, why no ASCII art of Sherwin? ;-)
