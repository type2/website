Subject: Re: 1983 balljoints?

John,

I've got the same symptom in my 87 with 146,000 miles.   I've replaced the
upper ball joints (reduced clunks somewhat) and will soon replace the lower
ones also.   I think the better test for ball joint wear is to compress the
joint with a C-clamp and measure play , then compare with a new one (this
is test for other cars).   Unfortunately, VW doesn't specify wear limits,
that I can find, so when I replace them I will measure and report to the
group the wear measured, and whether replacing the joint fixed the clunk.
I'm pretty sure that they are the cause.

Dave

&gt;Is it possible that the lower ball joints are gone?  My mechanic says
&gt;they are ok, he prys on the joint to check for play.  I am not sure this
&gt;is a valid check, does anyone know a more foolproof check?  What
