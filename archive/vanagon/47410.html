&gt;Hi there all,

&gt;I've been looking for a late '70's or early '80's westy, at this point
&gt;I'm really leaning towards the vanagons, I really like their interior.
&gt; What I've found is an 80 vanagon, very little rust, mint interior and
&gt;just about everything new or rebuilt. This thing runs and drives great!
&gt;This is the first Type 4 I've ran. It also had the fuel inj. replaced
&gt;with dual webers, is that a plus or minus? Well to get to the main point
&gt;here- when the bus idles it seems to have a knock, rev the engine
&gt;slightly and its gone. It's not a pounding rap, just a knock but it
&gt;still bothers me. Are type 4's generally noisy? My feeling is that it's
&gt;probably ok but I'd hate throw a rod or spin a bearing a week from now.
&gt;I have the price down to $2300. what do ya think?

I think it's asking for trouble.  The knock doesn't sound like a good
thing, and whoever replaced the FI with carbs should have their head
examined.  Do they have smog checks in Michigan?  Will the thing pass with
carbs?  If they don't have them, what if they start them next year?  Then
you're screwed.  I would stay away from the dual carbs.  Tell him you'll
buy it if he'll put the FI back in.  :)
