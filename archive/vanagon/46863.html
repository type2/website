Subject: Traveling Questions

In just about 2 weeks, I embark on my annual trip to the Great White 
North (Canada) for a vacation w/ my father and brother.  I have a few 
traveling questions that folks here might be able to answer.

1)  As my van gets older, I become more concerned about long trips in 
it.  If anyone can let me know some reliable shops along my route in 
the event I have trouble, I'd appreciate it a lot.

Route:  From Dallas/ Ft Worth, I35 North all the way to Duluth, MN.  
&gt;From Duluth, I will travel to International Falls on US 53.  I am 
pretty sure that once in Ontario, I will be on my own. 

2)  I am thinking about trying to camp on the way up and down to save 
$$.  Any suggestions for a camping location between Kansas City and 
Des Moines?  I don't have a Westy but I have a tent, etc.  I'd like 
to have access to showers in the am since I have to meet some people 
(preferably looking presentable) in Minneapolis.

Any help is greatly appreciated!!
