Subject: Ebersparker (SP?) heater for 1970 Westie

At the Palo Alto swapmeet Yesterday .I got myself a good working ebersparker.
But there is a problem.

The westie has a spare wheel well just where the heater is meant to go.  Does
one just cut away at the bottom of the spare wheel well and put the spare
wheel on the front of the bus. Shoud the cut-off wheel well be filled with
plywood say 1/2 &quot; thick or a piece of pop-riveted sheet metal.

Should the heater connect to the regular heater so that is works as a
defroster and everything or should the heat just get into the bus under the
rear seat?

Tks for any help.

hope to see you at red rock canyon.

will it be cold there or can I forget the heater till next year?
