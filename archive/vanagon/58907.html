------------------------------
I have a 93 White MV that developed rust along the bottom of the rear
hatch.  The van's in California so I don't have to worry about road salt
and bad winter weather.  The van was out of the 24 Month/24K warranty by a
little ways.  The dealer explained to me that the rust warranty covers
&quot;perforation&quot; and not just rusting paint.  But, the dealer had the service
rep look at it and VW had the rear hatch painted as a goodwill gesture.  I
ended up voluntarily  paying $100 to have a bunch of dings taken out of the
hatch too.  The service people thought that the hatch had been repainted at
some point and not properly primed.  Wierd but the problem was taken care
of.  Good luck.
