Subject:  Re: EV misc topics

&gt;
&gt;Last week I posted German classifieds 'VW Crewcab Syncro' where I
&gt;informed the list about a EV with a factory made higher clearance.
&gt;
&gt;So it's available from VW but I have no further information. May
&gt;I do some investigation?
&gt;

Well I'm sure they're not going to export one just for me - but
yes I would be *very* interested in knowing the engineering details
of such a conversion.
Like are there special modifications made to
standard parts - or do they just stick different struts on it or
what - I'm not familiar with lift kits that much!

I must have missed your original post - I subscribe
to the digest mode and its easy to overlook things sometimes.

thanks in advance,
-rick
