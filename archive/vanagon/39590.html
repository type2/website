Subject: 71-72 calipers, I may have some spairs.

Are you sure the 71-72 calipers are unique?  When I replaced my axle beem 
on my 72 I used one off a 74.  I kept all the parts from the old beem as 
spairs but If the calipers are different, I might be interested in some 
sort of trade.  BTW, have you concidered rebuilding your old calipers?
Ed.
