Subject: Clutch size?

Along with the '81 vanagon I just purchased, I got a spare 2000cc engine
with fresh cylinders, pistons, and heads. It was the original engine in
the '81, has fuel injection. I'm planning on removing the f.i. and putting
a Weber on it that came with my '73, then putting this engine in the 
'73. As far as I can see from both Haines and Bently, there is no cam
difference in the f.i. - carbureted engines. Right?
   The big difference I do notice, however, is clutch size. The '81 must
have had the 228mm clutch (it does have hydraulic linkage) while the '73
has the 210mm. The manual says that the 228mm is for the hydraulic clutch,
the 215mm for the cable operated. Question 1: Will the 228 clutch be too
stiff for the cable in the '73?   Question 2: Will the 215 clutch fit the
228 flywheel? I have to buy a new disk and pressure plate regardless, just
don't know which to go with.
