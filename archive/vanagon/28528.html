Subject: Baby needs a new clutch

Is there anyone on the list living near the St. Louis MO area who is just
itching to help a neophyte replace the clutch on an '88 Vanagon?  I've been
calling around for estimates, not really sure of any of the mechanics'
reliability, and I don't have the tools or know how to do the job myself
(don't even own a Bentley or Muir manual _yet_).  

So, if there happens to be anyone who just loves doing this stuff, happens to
be in the St. Louis area, and feels like Santa Claus, jus' let me know!

Thanks,

Cliff
'88 Vanagon GL with soon-to-start-slipping,
getting-hard-to-shift-from-third-to-fourth clutch
