Subject: &lt;syncro&gt; front diff lock report

Hi Syncronauts and all,

Just a quick note on front diff locks.  Finally drove mine with the lock
working, after the homebrew install.  Functions fine, wiring works, easy
engagement etc.

No warning label or handbook can prepare you for the effect this has on
steering when locked.  Tracks straight ahead and will fight the wheel many
times harder than the rear lock does to get straight.  I tried it in firm
dirt on the weekend, engaging it during a gentle turn, in G gear.  Spun the
wheel in my hands, despite grabbing on tighter when I felt it kick in.  Next
time I was able to get a wide turn out of it, at many times the normal
turning radius. Even with the steering wheel cranked you go way way
straighter than expected.  Wonder how the CV joints are taking the abuse?
Cause for concern there. I never had front and rear locks engaged at same
time!! Shudder to think of the tracking then.

This would be deadly on ice/snowy roads as zero steering would be available.
Likely won't turn much in soft mud either (next weekend!)  An Australian
listie, Steve O. said he uses his when fording rocky stream beds to get max
traction, and that seems like the perfect application.  Once I've tried it
in mud I'll report again.  If this thing ever kicks in while at speed in a
turn it will be game over!  No wonder it was never available in out
litagacious society.

bye, Tim
