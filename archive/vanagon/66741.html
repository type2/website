Subject:      gas leak

whenever i fill my 1980 westy completely up with gas (the gas tank you wise
guys) i get a strong smell of gas outside the van up front.

I had the same problem with my '87 Westy. Had to drive with the window open
after filling up, gas mileage was dismal (Could it be worse?). The leak got
worse with time, eventually when I parked on an incline (Driver's side
down) fuel poured out, making a big mess that got the attention of the
environmental folks where I work.

Problem was the cross-over vent line fitting. Teutonic engineers made the
tank divided with a large groove in the top to fit around other structures.
They connected the two of these top &quot;lobes&quot; with a vent line and some
fittings. The fittings can break (Didn't find out why, I think they might
be plastic). The mechanic managed to do the work without dropping the tank
(Less $$$).

The Bentley manual clearly shows the set up with models 80-91 similar.
