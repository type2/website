Subject: Rust Revalations in So. Cal.

Hi Vanagonians,

I have a LOT more sympathy for those of you in the rust belt now days.  As
some of you might have read, I'm replacing the engine in my 87 Syncro with a
90 engine I bought from a wrecking yard in Portland.  Since the exhaust tubes
on the Syncro are not the same as on the 2WD vans, I've had to transfer the
exhaust parts from my 87 to the 90 engine. It was no problem taking the parts
off my engine as they had only surface rust after 8 years.  The 90 engine
from Portland was another matter though.  I've spent several times longer
with it and have had to break 1/2 of the bolts!

Rust in Portland after 5 years is easily twice as bad as So. Cal. after 8
years.  At that rate my exhaust wouldn't get this rusty for 16 years!

And as bad as this rust is, I'm sure it doesn't hold a candle to some real
Michigan, Illinois, or Ohio rust!  No wonder you guys HATE rust so much!

On the subject of exhaust and rust, has anyone tried JET-HOT coating for
their exhaust?  I called them and they said that it would cost $160.-$200. to
coat a Vanagon exhaust inside &amp; out.  They sent me a brochure and a video.
 I'd really consider this if I lived in a rustier climate.  I just brushed
the rust off and painted mine with some high-heat paint.

Regards with newly enhanced rust-sympathy,
