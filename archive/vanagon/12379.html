So Ric grasping (gasping?)-for-straws(caffeine?)Golen says:
&gt; 
&gt; Wait...I've got it...I betcha Steve Johnson could get us a whole
&gt; shitload of them defective, returned Pentium chips...we could
&gt; cut off the little &quot;legs&quot; from them, rendering them even more
&gt; useless for future use ... that ought to make Intel happy...
&gt; then we could put some double stick tape on the back of 'em
&gt; and glue them to the back hatch of our busses...
&gt; 
&gt; Hell we could even have a slogan &quot;Pentiums...blindingly fast, but
&gt; in accurate....VW Vans....unnervingly slow...but accurate (?)
&gt; 
&gt; ;-)

You betcha I can get you a shit-load Ric! ;O  But it won't be Pentiums. ;p
