Subject: 86 Vanagon 4 speed 

The tranny won't shift into 4th and is very difficult to shift into 3rd. 1-2
and reverse shifts stiff but seem ok.  This just happened last night heading
home from up north at -10 deg C in a snow storm with glare ice on road.
Where is spring?

It sounds like $$$ to me - maybe the problem is the  3-4 synchromesh
someone(?)  posted  about some time ago.  I called 2 VW dealers and they
both estimate $1000.00 CDN labour, + parts. One offered 10% on parts.   

Circumstance is that I have a few days at spare and would consider tackling
this myself but need some encouragement and wisdom  from the group.  If
someone with similar problems could help maybe I can avoid enriching the VW
dealers.  

I checked the external linkage and this seems fime - in alignment and lubed.
Seems to be internal for sure.  Are there any other common places to look
for 3-4 shift problems besides the synchromesh?  If the problem requires
trans breakdown, and I'm probably resigned to that, what
problem/difficulties will I run into?  Are there any special tools that are
really needed?     Or am I really out of my mind to tackle this , save $$
and beat the VW dealer?

Btw, van has 240,000 Km and just spent $ on tires and shocks and the heads
do leak.

For the help I receive, many thanks in advance.
