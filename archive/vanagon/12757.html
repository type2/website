Subject: Used tires anyone?
Date: Tue, 07 Mar 95 12:59:41 EST
From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

  As of this week on the state surplus bidding sheets, there are several
lots of used Highway Patrol tires, 225/70/R15. There are also some snow
tires and stuff. Anyone want to go in on a lifetime supply of tires
probably for under $5.00 a tire? (I have run used tires on my bus {am
now}, and they generally are good for 10-20k miles). Any thoughts? I think
they are Goodyears. This is the Raleigh NC highway patrol office.
