Subject: Returning to a Panel Van/ Roof Grafting

A trawle round the assembled Splitty brains collected in one place revealed
much ah well ....anyway
1. Michael asked about resturning his van to a panel van and getting rid of
DIY installed side windows. If the bulk of the frame is OK then you need some
sheet steel (about 1.5mm). From your scrap/donating van you can use the
tophat/stiffening sections on the ribbing, or save the spare van and make/get
some made up. Cut the thicker steel slightly oversize of rrmoved window hole
and position inside the van. Seam weld round and use the stiffening sections
to stop the new piece moving when driving. Tidy with filler (bondo to you
guys?) and patience. Outside will look mint, inside will always be fairly
obvious burt can be made tidy and look acceptable.
2. Roof Grafting._dot_can't remember your name but here goes - take a chisel and
clean out all the sealant etc in gutter well all round the van to reveal the
original spot welds that were used to fix roof at factory. Drill all the spot
welds (lorra patience needed)out and you can then lift out one roof section
and replace it...but why do you need to do it? If your guttering is rotten
then make your donor section slightly larger  by cutting right into the
corner...if it is a real mess then you can chop half way down windows but this
cause allsorts of stress load bearing problems that then require attention..
if your reason is rot on the gutter and a little way into roof you can buy
some nice panel sections (Bay or Splitty) over here and i guess somewhere like
Das Bulli Haus in US is a source of similar repair panels.
        I went into replacing a roof or maybe roof / gutter panels in  Split I
nearly bought for Hal - in the end we walked away as I can't do it and
estimating cost for someone on a job like this is ..well...so we are buying
him a 1303S Ragtop Beetle instead! If anyone wants more detail (!) on this
kinda job...well you know where I am. Lee Griffiths (hi Lee) is about to put
the whole front section of a barndoor van (no peak) onto a hybrid he's
building, maybe he can add some more? Love       Dave :)
