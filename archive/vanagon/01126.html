Subject: Re:  The Muir solenoid trick

i think it should be 
87 to solenoid
30 to battery

85 to ignition switch
86 to ground

i think if you get 85 or 86 switched it shouldnt affect things, but
there is a convention, which , if you don't follow. will conflict
with the Teutonic blood of the beast leading to early trans failure ...

(not claiming to have the convention correct btw)
