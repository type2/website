&gt; According to the article I have about the Oettinger, the engine was an
&gt;experimental project commissioned by VW, but VW decided not to produce it.
&gt; It was created by adding an extra pair of cylinders to a revised crankshaft
&gt;and crankcase.  The internal dimensions are the same as the 2.1 liter (94mm
&gt;bore and 76mm stroke), I assume in an effort to keep manufacturing costs
&gt;down. 

I've heard this as well.  VW designed the motor and decided not to produce
it.  Then sold the design &amp; manufacturing rights to Oettinger... So I've
heard.
