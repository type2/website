                              Keeping Warm in a VW Bus

This article will explore three basic requirements that must be met to insure
your bus provides a comfortable habitation during both winter cold and summer
heat.  The requirements are adequate insulation, proper ventilation, and
heating.

Heat rises.  Warm the interior of your Volkswagen bus and that heat will
naturally rise toward the roof... and go right through it.  Because heat
rises and because the roof is so large, maintaining a comfortable interior
temperature when camping in your bus can be an expensive and even dangerous
proposition.  Expensive because the lost heat must be replaced by burning
fuel, dangerous because Carbon Monoxide, one of the by-products of burning
that fuel, is a silent, cumulative poison.

Keeping warm in a Volkswagen bus, even in below-freezing weather, is a
do-able thing but it isn't something the stock bus or camper was designed
for.  To keep warm you must keep the heat in and the cold out.  You do this
by insulating the bus.  The windows can't be insulated directly but they can
be covered thermal barriers and with insulating blankets.

The most practical insulation for space-shuttle fuel tanks, aircraft cabins
and Volkswagen buses is urethane foam sprayed directly onto the surface to be
insulated.  For Volkswagen buses, you can spray-on about two inches of foam
on the interior of the roof (and as much as you want on the exterior) and
about one inch on all the vertical surfaces.  Any more than that and the foam
will interfere with the fit of the interior trim panels, upholstery and
headliner.  The doors may be literally filled with foam after making
allowance for the latch and window mechanisms.  The interior trim is of
course removed before the foam is sprayed on, all areas where you don't want
the foam to stick being masked-off.  Recessed areas that can't be sprayed
directly are filled with non-sprayable foam, the stuff available in hardware
stores.  The 'canned' foam is installed first, allowed to harden and then
trimmed.  The masking is applied and then the spray-foam is applied to the
interior of the vehicle, usually in one over-all application.  Once it
expands and cures, the masking is removed, the foam trimmed as needed and the
interior trim, upholstery and headliner reinstalled.

Insulating blankets use a combination of materials to take advantage of
reflection and insolation.  Polyurethane foam sandwiched between aluminized
mylar creates a remarkably effective heat barrier if the blanket is secured
to the structure so as to prevent air flow around the blanket.  Snaps,
Velcro, or magnetic strips are used to secure the blankets.  The use of such
blankets obviously obstructs the view through the glass and should not be
used while the vehicle is in motion.  To provide a 'clear-view' insulated
window you will have to use multiple panes of glass or plastic with a dry
inert gas between them.  Fitting Lexan panels over the interior of the
windscreen using an RTV compound is one method that has been used on vehicles
in Antarctica.

When the object is to maintain a steep temperature differential in an
enclosed space you will find you'll have to deal with every possible
heat-flow path, and that means every metal fitting that can conduct heat from
inside the space must be provided with some form of thermal insulation, or
the fitting must be isolated, the conductive path broken.

To achieve an adequate level of insulation it isn't necessary to resort to
the extreme measures taken in say a space craft, but the fundamental
principles must be understood and the basic rules observed.  Failure to do so
can see you spend a lot of money for insulation and still end up with a bus
that's too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter.

Perhaps the most unfortunate failing in preparing a vehicle for cold weather
use is the failure to provide for adequate ventilation.  If the occupants of
an insulated space are to remain comfortable the air within that space must
be continually exchanged, not only to insure adequate oxygen but to remove
moisture.  Humans generate about 70 watts of heat per hour, along with nearly
half a pint of moisture.  Exchanging cabin air for exterior air is the most
obvious method of getting rid of the moisture while providing adequate oxygen
but of course the exterior air will be cold.  If it is a great deal colder
than the quanta of heat in the air it is replacing, some form of supplimental
heating must be provided.

A neat point here, and one often overlooked, is that people generate quite a
lot of heat.  In a well insulated enclosure the heat of the occupant(s) is
often enough to send the temperature soaring to uncomfortable levels.
 Introduction of outside air is used to regulate the interior temperature.

Ventilation in the typical non-pop-top camper is very poor.  The interior air
should be removed from a LOW point of the inorder to rid the space of heavy
gases such as carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon esters.  Incoming air should be
introduced through a tempering system, such as a length of uninsulated
aluminum pipe.  The cold exterior air will cause much of the interior
moisture to condense on the surface of the tempering pipe where it may be
drained away, at the same time the exterior air will pick up heat from the
interior. If additional heating is need it should be applied to the incoming
air-stream near the delivery end of the tempering system so as not to defeat
the condensation effect.  Removal of the interior air is best accomplished
with a small variable-speed fan located well away from the interior space and
isolated so its operation can not be heard.  There are a number of
muffin-type fans that are suitable and a number of places on the vehicle
where they can be installed.  The controls should be clearly marked and
fitted with an indicator showing when the fan is operating.  With a bit of
thought it should be possible to have the fan respond to a thermostat, making
its operation automatic once it is manually actuated. 

When heating an enclosed, insulated space, and when the heat is generated by
combustion, the heater must be provided with its own air supply and exhaust.
 The interior space must be heated by convection or radiation.  

The typical camper or RV space heater uses bottled gasseous fuels.  Such
fuels are convenient but expensive in terms of BTUs.  As a general rule, the
amount of heat available from a given fuel is equal to the weight of the
carbon in the fuel, less any residue.  By comparison, a gallon of kerosene
represents more potential heat energy than a gallon of propane or even a
gallon of gasoline.  In the same vein, you'll see that charcoal is an
emminently practical fuel given the right conditions.

The typical camper or RV space heater is a packaged system, the camper or RV
designed to accomodate the 'package'.  When forced to install such a packaged
system into a vehicle not designed to accept it, the compromises may outweigh
the advantage of convenience and ready availability.  The system I've
described here treats the Volkswagen bus as a unique entity, without regard
to such packaged systems.  Indeed, I have viewed the bus as the 'package' and
described systems that accomodate rather than compromise its uniqness.  I
realize few of you can take full advantage of my point of view but the
fundamental principles and ultimate goal still apply.

                               A Few Notes, and a Bit of Blue Sky

An unexpected but entirely welcome benefit of spray-on foam insualtion is its
sound deadening qualities.  A well insulated bus is amazingly quiet.  If the
engine compartment and transmission area of the under-body are insulated as
well as the roof, sides and doors, the cockpit area of the typical bus
becomes as quiet as a luxury sedan.

Volkswagen buses used as campers often suffer from interior rust, primarily
from condensation above the headliner and behind the trim panels, but also as
a result of spilled water and urine, the latter being extremely corrosive.

The most commonly available high-efficiency 'heat blanket' is the aluminized
pads used to cover ironing boards.  People with pop-top style campers might
find a few ironing board covers, suitably tailored and secured with Velcro,
can extend the use of their camper well into the snowy season.

Aluminzed mylar window film works in both directions.  It reduces the amount
of heat that can enter your van during the summer and the amount that can
leave it during the winter.  The stuff is a thermal barrier, restricting the
natural hot-to-cold flow of heat.  The combination of silvered windows and
insulated curtains makes an effective, low-cost thermal barrier.

Each dollar spent insulating the roof of your bus is probably equal in
effectiveness to each $100 spent insulating the floor and walls.

If properly insulated, the heat from two people is enough to keep the
interior of a VW bus at a cozy temperature down to about 30 degrees
Fahrenheit (about -1 C.)  For an overnight camp-out in the snow, the
old-fashioned footwarmer -- oven-heated bricks -- works surprisingly well as
an auxiliary heater.  You'll need a metal-lined ice chest, such as an
older-model Coleman to carry the hot bricks, and they are heavy as hell,  but
they give up their heat slowly and will keep even an uninsulated bus fairly
comfortable through a long winters night.  When camping in the wild, rocks
heated in your campfire serve the same purpose.  No need to carry them with
you of course, although when you get to your next campsite you'll want to be
sure you only try heating DRY rocks.

The most powerful heat-source in your Volkswagen is the engine.  The most
practical system of heating the vehicle when stopped would be some form of
waste heat storage and recovery.  One method of achieving this is to use
waste heat to heat a brine of  eutectic salts stored in heavily insulated
containers such as a pair of 3&quot; diameter stainless steel pipes attached to
the frame.  Such brines can be heated to nearly 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
 The heat may be recovered with the vehicle at rest through a variety of
means, a pressurized water system probably being the most practical.  By the
same token, such a heat source would work very well with an evaporative
refrigeration system. Perhaps one day we will see such systems.
