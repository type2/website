Well,

	DMV sent all my stuff back to me once again, this time telling me I
need to pay $170 to get it registered.
	
	I went down there yesterday to ask why.  It seems that the only way they
will order fees is if I can get the owner at the time (who is in her 90's
now) to provide proof that the bus wasn't used from a given range of dates.

	This is supposed to be the last hurdle, but we'll see.

BTW - Non-VW content - the first estimate on the damage on my 911 came in
at almost $3200!
