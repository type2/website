Subject: So, what's the secret handshake?

Vanamaniacs,

        Change the stats Joel cuz this Madison, Wi list member has a new
Syncro Westfalia. Found while browsing the used camper section of the
Sunday paper. SO of the PO has banged her up pretty well. A couple of
dents, a little rust and bad tires brought the asking price down
considerably from $10,500. Needless to say we are happy as larks at this
point and looking forward to our pursuit of photographing all the roadside
fiberglass animals we can find, starting within our own states lovely
boarders and eventually moving on to cover anywhere our little hearts
desire.

        So, all the Westie q and a's I've been trashing for the past year
are going to come back and haunt me. Guess I'll have to pull up my sleeves
and dig into the archives!

        Sig. file has been updated! Check it out:
