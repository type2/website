&gt; &gt; If you have an easily removeable part that is liable to attract thieves you
&gt; &gt; may wish to consider an alarm switch activated by the removal of a critical
&gt; &gt; fastener.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Seems like a motion sensor would cover this problem, although the
&gt; sensitivity might have to be set pretty high.

I have seen something cool in the Damark catalog.  I think it was about
$130.  It's one of those motion detectors that is basically a beam of
(infared?) light transmitted across a space, kind of like a trip wire.
Someone breaks the beam, and it can be set up to beep inside your house.
I plan on mounting one of these in the fence at the end of my driveway
so that if anyone enters the driveway where by bus is parked, I will
know about it, and will be able to stop the theft before it happens.  It
will be really nice to be able to leave a CB/Stereo installed and not
have to worry.  I can provide more details if anyone is interested.
