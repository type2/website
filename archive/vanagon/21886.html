Subject: 15 inch wheels


Has anybody tried to put 15 inch wheels on their vanagon? It seems that 
the European Synchros are so equipped.

Where would you get 15 inch wheels that fit the vanagon in the U.S.? 
(Beetle? Eurovan?) Is there enough space to run those wheels on a stock 82
vanagon (I know, some of the newer models are lower)? What would be an 
appropriate place for the spare tire? How much would your speedometer 
reading change?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

TIA,
Joerg
