Subject: Stuck bolt

In checking out my '88 Westy, I decided to take a look at the spare,
Unfortunately the 19mm bolt that hold the tray that the spare rests on does
not want to come off. Any clever ideas? I was thinking of just finding a
garage with an air wrench that I could talk a mechanic to applying to the
bolt.
