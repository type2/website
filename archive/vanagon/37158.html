Subject: /f ?Advice on Shipping to Norway

Hi All,

I need to send an large package to Norway economically.  The box is about 
4 foot in length by 2 feet high by 2.5 feet wide.  The recipient prefers 
surface, but I haven't found a means to send it yet.  Airfrieght quotes 
have been about 200-450 bucks from Kansas City.  The box weighs about 50-60 
lbs?  Any advice or leads appreciated.  Thanks
