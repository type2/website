Did YOU know that there are 12 passenger T4s?  I saw a stretch version last
summer that is sold in Eurpoe with an extra bench seat.  Now I was told,
but unable to confirm, that the Winnebago camper was based on the longer
wheelbase of the stretch version.  More trivia.

&gt;BTW didja know that there are 11 passenger T4s? Yep, one can get the 9 pass
&gt;configuration with two side-mounted jump seats in the rear luggage
&gt;compartment.
