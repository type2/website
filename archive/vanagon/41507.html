Subject: Trans fluid: GL-5 vs. GL-4 vs. synthetic

I received four noteworthy responses to my query about synthetic
transmission oils and GL-5 vs. GL-4 oils.

Three of these are reproduced below (Tim's was too advanced into the topic,
typically). 

Dennis Haynes points out that the Mobil 1 Synthetic oil *includes* a GL-4
rating on it as well as the GL-5 rating so why worry abou it? 

John Anderson is emphatic about not using GL-5 and points to REdline MTL GL4. 

Alistair Bell was cognizant and respectful of both opinions and opted for
Redline himself. I'm with Alistair.

I read the quart container of the Mobil-1 SHC 75W-90.  It reads &quot;exceds the
reqiurements for GL-3, GL-4, and GL-5 and MIL 2105C.  Different GL specs can
not incompatible if listed in same product.  Especially form a mojor
manufacturer such as Mobil.  As for talk of gasket lekage, the VW trans uses
paper gaskets.  All oils have additives to keep the seals soft.
