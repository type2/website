'67 Westy Resto form Hell Update
*Installed Safaris*
A couple of cronies who knew what they were doing installed the German
Safaris into the '67 Resto while VanBondo drooled in the backgroundand
handed tools. The installation went well except for the aftermarket latch
handles which appear to need to be ground down about a 1/4&quot;  in order to
even think about closing! Thirty sumpin bucks a piece leaves me leary of
cranking up the bench grinder. I installed the totally hosed OEM versions
instead of altering the repops.  No new thread originating from me please!
The NOS latches which were acquired from the big time parts guru  were well
worth the money paid in the long run. Now if I could find some nice OEM
&quot;left&quot; latches then I would be set!

*Rubber Installation*
Broke out the Monkey Goo and got brave. I was smart enough to dry fit the
pieces prior to getting messy. Gave up trying to figure out where the
billion pieces of  long  grey/rectangular door seals went and moved onto the
rear hatch. The rear hatch seal fit great up until the last six inches. In
order to set all of the premolded corners in place and to align the section
for the belt line hump, a minor adjustment (read cut the thing) need to be
made. Quick Honey!, grab the super glue!  All worked out in the end.
I need some clarification as to how exactly the pieces of  grey/rectangular
door seals install prior to going on.

*Front Door Windows*
Tons of fun! (not) Found that a couple of items were overlooked during the
zillion months of paintshop hell. The stationary window (vertical) post and
the latch retention adjustment zoobie for one side were missing and the same
piece for the other side was simply painted by the Bodyshop from Hell
without thinking about straightening. Thankfully, one of the folks helping
to install the safaris is a paint/body guy who is able to help.
A footnote is that once the top half of the door was installed, the door
started to rub on the dogleg. &quot;Groovy&quot; was not the word used to describe
this discovery. This was discovered before the paint got mangled.

*Keying the Doorlocks/Ignition*
The same set of helper buddies and I sorted throught the pile of misc
latches, handles and related  UFO items organizing them into appropriate
piles. The guru looked at the mfg date on the back and stated that I oughta
get the &quot;correct&quot; month (11/66 or 9/66) handles rechromed vs using a perfect
set which carry a slightly earlier date (2/66). I think I will rush right
down and get it done just because he said so. ;-) I think this is worth the
cash and potential chrome shop hell especially since the date is on the
inside of the handle and is about eight point type. I think I will risk
ridicule from &quot;Charlie&quot; on this one. Oooooh the threat looms

*Camper Window Cop-out*
This exercise has been avoided since the last update in a manner similar to
a public version of the annual physical! Ahem, cough! I am gingerly
approaching said exercise this evening.

*Brake Pedal Return Spring*
Has been approached with the same vigor as the camper windows. What a pain
in the ...

But anyway that's enough for now.
