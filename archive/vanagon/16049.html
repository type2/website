&gt;One question, though... did anybody get a recall notice like I did in 
&gt;the US??  or is this a Canadian recall only?
&gt;
&gt;Harry.

Most of us got our recalls here, like, two years ago or something. Something
is wrong if you are just getting a notice now. Or perhaps they mailed the
notice to you Canadians via the annual barge that goes to Ungava Bay.
