Subject:      cleaning greasy/grimy parts ...

somebody on another car list reminded me of this ...

one sunday recently, a tv show about classic cars mentioned a way of cleaning
really grimy, oily, dirty parts (like oil pans, etc.): household drain cleaner

yup. he put about three cups of something like Draino crystals into ten
gallons of HOT water, and then dunked the part into the toxic mess, using
a coat hanger to hold the part.

precautions: he wore eye protection, big thick rubber gloves; and his wife
is gonna kill him cause he was doing it in the kitchen!!!

but it did seem to work. now, the thought that occurs to me is: what will
that stuff do to ALUMINUM parts??? :(

anyway, if you have some really grimy parts and you want to clean them without
a lot of scrubbing and such, you might want to try this ...

besides ... if it dissolves the part, think how shiny the NEW part will be! :)

how to get rid of the ten gallon toxic waste bucket?? pour it down the drain,
where it was destined anyway.


the things you see on television these days! :)
