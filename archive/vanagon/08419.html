Subject: Return of Westfalia

Finally, after nearly 4 months of waiting, I got my '71 Westy back!
The entire top is 'new' (well, refurbished), including all rubber
seals, tent section, and folding cot.  It looks great, and everything
operates smoothly!  It sure is nice to drive again.  My Bug, which I've
been driving, is too fast, too warm, and gets entirely too much gas 
mileage!

The only real problem with it right now, is that sometime during the
last four months, it smells like a whole herd of cats took up residence
inside! (it sat open to the elements for some time) I was checking for 
rust spots under the floor mat up front, and there was some water (I 
think it was water!) under it that smelled to high heaven!  I wiped it up 
and dried the area off, but the smell won't go away.  I tried treating it 
with everything from lysol to bleach, but so far no luck.

What do you think would work best?
