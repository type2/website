Subject: Tires: 185 or 205's?

Hey all-
With all the tire talk recently, I decided to check the tires more closely on
my 86 Syncro GL, that I've had for about 6 months. When I bought the Syncro I
was pleased that it had 4 of the same tires, in great condition, all with
even wear. When I checked the tires again after learning a bit more recently,
I was sorely dissapointed. Seems I have the wrong tires-I have Yokohama GS4's
(205/70R14), which I think are regular passenger tires. They are specified at
93S load rating which I guess is high for passenger tires, but not a C rating
and not reinforced.
So, I'm going to buy 5 new tires-probably the Yokoham Y356's at my local
Sears Auto Center. (maybe I can get them for free?!) I have some questions
for those who have been through this:
1) The specs on the door jam call for 185's or 205's-the original tires I
think were 185's. Does going skinnier have any disadvatages? Less grip,
stability or handling? Are they better in snow, being thin? What do you all
prefer?
2) I may be able to get the Yoko Y370g's, but some people tell me they are
being discontinued or that the 356's are replacing them. Any clues? I'd like
to get something I will be able to purchase again in the future, if need be.
Which do people prefer-the 370's at a C rating or the 356's at a D rating
which would be a rougher ride, I think?
3) Most of my driving is paved roads, so Im going for the Highway tread-any
other suggested tires that are in the Yokohama price range-about $69-$79 per
at Sears?
Thanks all.
