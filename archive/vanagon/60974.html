Subject: Vanagon Sunroof air deflector bubble wanted

Hi, all - I am looking for a smoked tinted black lexan (plastic) sunroof air
deflector bubble for the Vanagon sunroof.
These are NLA from VW.
The German company who made them is named  &quot;Uim Air&quot; and they made sunroof
bubbles for all VW's (golf/jetta etc) too, and distributed them thru VW
dealers. 
Anybody know of a sunroof van in a junkyard w/ one of these on it, or know of
one kicking around somewhere in a dealers partsroom or someone's garage?

Anybody have a address for Uim Air??

slim chance at any of the above, but appreciate any leads...

chris
