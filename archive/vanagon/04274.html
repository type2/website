&gt;Joel, this list is loaded with callow youths, Korean Conflict ? I can
&gt;remember VE Day and VJ day and trainloads of trucks, Jeeps,  Tanks
&gt;etc. heading to the west coast port for the pacific war.  However

ha! says you!! i kin recollect the boys lining up at the train station,
saying goodbye to their kinfolks, afore going off to fit them Yankees!! :)

well, actually, you've got me beat then. i was just a gleam in my father's
eyes on VE day. :) so the earliest i can recall is Korea. and Truman. but
the first president i really 'remember' was Ike. still remember old Winston,
though. he was still kicking around back then.

what has always fascinated me about buses is that they seem to span so many
age groups. it is almost a personality-attraction, rather than an age-group-
attraction (like, say, bmw's are today ... at least the 3-series bimmers).
it must be something about like fascination follows function.  you have to
admit: the vw bus is not the prettiest, or the most powerful, or the
'snazziest' or really any kind of -est.  rather homely, as a matter of fact.

so why do so many people of such varying ages and occupations like them?
beats me. i'm just glad they made them. :)
