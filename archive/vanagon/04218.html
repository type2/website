Subject: Re: Front 'badges' / emblems

In Manhattan where I live all the vanagons and even vw sedans were missing
their emblems because the VW symbol became a hot status item in nightclubs.
People were stealing the emblems off the cars and then wearing them in the
night scene. 

The craze has mercifully passed now.
