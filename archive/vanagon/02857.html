&gt; &gt;Don't let it git ya down Joel. Them damnyankees are a little nasty after
&gt; &gt;looking at all those years of salt damage on their buses! Did I tell ya... we
&gt; &gt;actually used salt 2 or 3 times last winter! I didn't know what it was at
&gt; &gt;first!
&gt; 
&gt; Uh, what exactly is salt??  Is that something you get a JC Whitney?

Thom, salt is what we drive on out in the desert.  Kinda like sand, only
different, ya know?
