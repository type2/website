Greetings and salutations:

My wife is complaining &quot;The A/C is not as cold as it could be....&quot;

It does have a slow leak (but that's not the main problem I think).
 I added less than a can last summer.
 I put the gauges on it today (70 degree ambiant) and had about 175 psi
on the high side . the low side had about 50 at idle  but dropped down
to 5 psi at 1500 rpm.
I'm thinking restriction somewhere. The other clue is after you shut off
the engine it takes a n extremly long time for the gauges to equalize.
Does anyone know if this is normal on this model (85 GL).
Suggestions?
