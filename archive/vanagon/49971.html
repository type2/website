Dale,

I saw a report about 4 or 5 years ago in a monthly magazine called 'The
Bottom Line' that listed the Vanagon as on of the safest cars or vans.  The
article was about unsafe cars and it got my attention when I saw Vanagon in
the text but it was referring to vehicles that were rated safest.

I wish I still had the article.

&gt; 
&gt; Having just about given up on the fantasy of buying a EV camper (too
&gt; expensive), I've been thinking about a Westy (1985 or newer: suggestions
for
&gt; best/worst years would be appreciated), but now my wife is voicing some
&gt; pretty serious concerns about the safety of these vehecles.  I personally
am
&gt; not too worried about it but she has always been somewhat frightened by
&gt; highway/freeway traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any and all info,
&gt; 
&gt; Dale
