jason (jbsmith_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com),

 i tried to post this to you privately but your address is bouncing mail
back to me. FYI and for the general info on the list, the 65 ex-camper
panel van i had has been sold to josh kline and friends in ny. they will be
coming to pick it up this weekend.

hopefully this weekend i will be getting a 1960 kombi (model 235) w/
factory sunroof w/ 70,000 orig. miles. by ontario standards it is very
straight (still has orig. paint on the belly :) and the nice grey paint in
the cab area.

michael
