Subject: '87 Syncro CV boot clamp gone


Hi folks,

While swapping my winter tires for the summer set today I noticed one of
the CV boots hanging half-off the joint.  It is the front driver's side
inner boot, and the inboard clamp is GONE.  Since the dealer put it on less
than three months ago, he'll repair it free.  But since he got it wrong
(among other things), I've lost faith in him and would like to do it
myself.

But I'm not up to removing the axle.

1. Can I remount the boot with a new clamp without taking the joint out?

2. It has less than 2000 miles on the boot, mostly on dry snow and ice.
The joint looks plenty greasy.  Is the CV joint most likely O.K.?

3. If this is possible, is there a recommended clamp?

Many many thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Chris Wyatt
