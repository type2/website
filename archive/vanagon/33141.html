Subject: Accelerator pump tube (was My bus hates me...8(  )

When I first got my '65 deluxe it was (still is) outfitted with a DP 1600
and the 3pct34 carberator.  Experienced similar &quot;flat-spot&quot;, poor idle, and
numerous other annoyances.  (The PO was NOT mechanically inclined - had the
bus for ~ a year).  I removed said carberator (found one of the back nut
securing the carberator to the manifold was loose) and gave it a rebuild.
After installing I had more problems, severe icing along the throat and still
poor idle.  I removed carb and found the accelerator pump tube was gone (or
did I forget to install?)  The PPO (that's the previous previous owner) told
me I threw that baby out with the soaking solution and just didn't notice the
missing accelerator pump tube.  Somehow I felt it got lose and sucked into the
intake and is residing in one of the heads.  Replaced tube and was back on the 
road.  A week later I lost power in the #1 cylinder.  My worst fears... 
As I was removing the spark plug for a compression test I found the electrode
As I was removing the spark plug for a compression test I found the electrodes
smashed together.  Compression check gave 120.  Now I think the accelerator 
pump tube either is residing in my exhaust system or is free roaming Rt 66.
Later, I pulled the heads and found no sign of damage....
