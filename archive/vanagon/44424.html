Subject:      speedometers for older buses ...

for those of you wanting trip odometers in your speedometers for older
buses, start checking with junkyards and speedo repair places. remember
that while VW might not have put the fancy speedometers into buses,
other companies like Volvo and Saab and so forth would have put such
niceties into their cars and as long as the speedo has the same &quot;number&quot;
(some number on the face of the speedo dial, which indicates the ratio
of the unit), it should work with your bus. that is, IF the Volvo has the
same 14&quot; wheels AND the same cable ends (which is pretty likely, i would
think).

one bad thing about doing this would be if you got a speedo from a very
old car that actually had MORE miles than your bus!!! cause you are not
likely going to be able to run the speedo backwards. :)

i did this swap (but it was a speedo from a fancy bus) on my 80 vanagon,
and thought about trying to run the fancy speedo (with less miles) up to
the same miles as my old non-trip-odometer speedo ... but when i sat down
and figured how long it would take, i gave up the idea:
12,000 mile difference: using an electric drill, running the new speedo at
60 mph (well, i didn't want to break it), it would take only 200 hours of
continuous running! or about 8.5 days!!! 24 hours a day! gack!!! and my
electric bill would likely skyrocket! :) &lt;assuming the drill didn't burn out
first ... i don't think Black &amp; Decker intended their drills for that sort
of abuse&gt;

anyway, the point being that there are other cars out there that likely
have a similar-enough speedo that could be used.
