Subject: Re: Street camping

My wife and I, pre-marriage/child days used to spend a week or so in Boston 
each summer, 'camped' adjacent to the common, and right by the Ritz. We then 
moved to the country, crossed the Charles river and found a big empty field 
jsut off the riverfront drive. We used to wash in the Ritz, at the Aquarium, 
Museum etc.             I once spent about a week in central London England, 
with about 60 yup sixty!, VW bus folk trying to sell a van before flying 
out. Great scene, after 5pm the business district closed up, VW folks 
started appearing on the sidewalk, cooking supper in the VWs and generally 
enjoying life. The police would ticket and thus clear one side of the street 
so people motored into a pay parking lot. When the police got to the 
otherside those VW folks would simply cross the road and take up the empty 
spots. We all played musical cars once a day like this. I also sold the van 
IN the parking lot, where it was test driven. The new owner payed the 
parking fee on the way out! Anyone know if this still goes on there, used to 
be at Australia House, then moved to other side of the Thames, near a small 
bridge.?
        The best street camping I know of was VW friends on a ski trip at 
Xmas time. Got into a small Quebec town in the early AM, looking for an 
outside plug to 'borrow' some electricity from for the heater. No luck at 
the motels, so they parked next to the Xmas tree in the town square, put a 
short! extension cord out the window and plugged into the strings of lights. 
OK but for the little twinkling lights all night!  bye tim s.
