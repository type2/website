Subject: International Currency Converter (Non VW)
From: Scott Chen &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

What with dealings with listmembers in Europe and the possibilities of 
SA VW parts purchases, and the usual US-Canada  connection,  it might 
be useful to know of a website that does International Currency 
conversions.  Very easy to use, usual disclaimers apply as to accuracy 
of information and what-not.  I am in no way affiliated with this site. 
 And it's free.
