&gt;The A/C on my 90 Syncro Westy seems to stop working every 3 years.
&gt;I suspect a slow leak and my experience suggests that the shop is too lazy
&gt;to find a slow leak.
&gt;So I am thinking that when I take the van in in a couple of weeks (to an
&gt;official VW dealer, cause it is still under warranty) I am doing to demand,

it's been my observation that dealers (of most brands) do NOT have anyone that
is very knowledgable about a/c. perhaps because they don't have that many
problems come in (volume-wise), or they can't keep anyone that is any good.

my 88 bus would leak out most of its freon every year. until i started running
the a/c every week for about 10-20 minutes. it's now been 2 years since i had
to have anything done to the system. not even any freon added in those two
years.

so all you a/c folks out there, my advice is to run that sucker each week ...
especially in the winter.

as to getting the a/c fixed at the dealer: just hope you get a service advisor
who's having a good day. and a mechanic that cares.
