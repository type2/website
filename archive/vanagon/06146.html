&gt; Sorry for the slow reply, but I'm with the group that favors the
&gt; coast instead of the Sierras (at least during winter).  Someone
&gt; mentioned the campgrounds by Morro Bay.  Montana de Oro and
&gt; Los Osos state parks are choice.   Plus, us surfers can do our
&gt; best imitations of shark food at Morro Rock.

I just went camping at the Morro Bay campgrouns...right there ono the 
ocean. Very nice. Quick off the freeway. Decent facilities..no showers. 5 
minutes to a decent grocery store. Very very nice sandy beach and view. 
Sleep to the ocean sounds.
