Subject: shakedown trip with infant

yes, finally the weather gods &amp; the circumstances at work brought together
a sunny weekend that I could take off! So we went down to Oregon coast,
which was
great. It's been a long time since I was there when it was both warm and dry!

For this, we pulled one of the pads down from the top bunk, placed it the
floor in front of the kitchen unit, and let the baby sleep there. (At this
point she can't even rollover, but she did perform an interesting trick -
spinning around in a complete 360 degree circle over the course of the
night.)

Clearly this technique isn't going to work once she's more mobile - I don't
want to find her sleeping in the foot well by the sliding door! Has anyone
come up with any interesting tricks to keep a sleeping infant confined
safely?
I'm debating taking a folding playpen along and setting it up in that
space, but  it would sure be awkward.
