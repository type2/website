Greetings from a long time lurker.

I had the same problem with our '90 Carat.  My read on the situation at the
time was that it wasn't the winder taking up too much cable breaking the
guides, but the cheap rivet holding the plastic guide breaking that allowed
the winder to take up the extra slack.  After spending a couple of hours
and numerous finger punctures trying to untangle the cable, I bit the
bullet, went to the dealer and paid the $150 for a new regulator.  The good
news is that the part is available separately from the motor (another $150
item) (contrary to Bentley).  I figured reattaching the guides with pop
rivets would probably result in having to redo the job shortly anyway.  I
don't have a clue about the clip you found.

This was easy compared to the time I decided to take apart the shoulder
belt winder. SPROING!!!

Good Luck,
