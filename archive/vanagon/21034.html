It seems that Muir has struck again on this one.  God knows I love the
man but this really gets me.  The guy in the Changes section says &quot;I
don't support the tranny on my '78 so why should you&quot; or some such.  A
little asterisk noting that those extra bolts came in in '72 would be 
a big help.  In my freshman year of VW repair, if I had to give any 
advice, it would be to read Muir, Bentley and Haynes before you touch 
a wrench.  Also, it helps to have several hundred internet friends who
have done it before.  Thanks, Jim
