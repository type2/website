Subject: VW/Chevy sighting

Or maybe it was a mating.
On my bike ride home from work yesterday I spotted a brown Chevy Van.  
Its grill had been painted gold and a large early bus emblem had been 
wired to the grill and also painted gold.  A VW Bus Wannabe! &lt;grin&gt;

I told my wife and she thought it was &quot;cute&quot;.
