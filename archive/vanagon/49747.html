&gt; '56 Beetle, solid floors, won't last, $1150, 540-364-3960.
I wonder what won't last, the floors? or the car at that price?  Probably
the floors at that price!

 
&gt; '56 Beetle, new 1835cc motor, runs good, solid car, $2000, call
&gt; 301-805-5699 evenings.

Are all Oval bugs this cheap on the east coast, this one sound a bit
under-priced for
Washington State, but we don't see many ovals for sale, who does?
