Subject: Re: 1971 original windshield wiper length


&gt;The whole blade assembly is most assuredly not original on mine.  The 
&gt;drivers side hits the windshield seal, and the antenna :-(. 


Well, for that, you can always try the &quot;cure&quot; that someone implemented
on mine before I bought it: the antenna is broken off at the base!
