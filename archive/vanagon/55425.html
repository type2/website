Subject: Need Half - Shafts

Hi!

It's been a while since I've posted here but . . . I need help in 
locating reasonably priced &quot;half shafts&quot; for my 85 GL.  If anyone can 
suggest a good mail order source, etc., I'd appreciate it!

In case this has been a recent thread, please feel free to respond to 
me directly rather than on the list.
