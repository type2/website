&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;After much ado about nothing, I finally got the van to pass emissions by
&gt;employing the tightened MFC spring trick.  The problem now is the mileage
&gt;is AWFUL, doubt it's getting even 15 mpg.  Any thoughts on where to look
&gt;would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;TIA,

At the considerable risk of sounding stooopid, what'sa 'MFC'???
