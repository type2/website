I just tightened this up this Summer and if memory serves, you have to 
remove the inside sliding door fiberboard.  There's a phillips screw in 
there that holds the outside handle on.  Put a bit of paint on the screw 
so it doesn't back out again.  Don't overtighten it or the door handle 
just digs into the body, tearing things up even more.
