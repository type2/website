&gt;        Hmmm...oh. Im working on this multimedia project right now and we
&gt;needed some underwater images. So I was looking through a Corel photo CD on
&gt;underwater life when I came across a photo of an old VW van that sunk, and
&gt;has become a rather nice place for coral to hang out. It looks to be a
&gt;70's, although its hard to tell with all the fish around it.

Call Sen. Kennedy... I heard he had some nice ones like that.   :^)


&gt;        On with the questions:
&gt;1) If I notice a small paint chip or ding, whats the best preventitive
&gt;measure to take in regards to preventing rust?

Get a little bottle of same-color paint from a VW dealer ($$) or from
your FLAPS, and dab it on immediately. If you get to it before any rust
takes hold, you don't need to prime or sand. It's a good holding action,
until you finally save enough to paint the car in a few years.


&gt;2) What sort of mileage should an '83 Westfalia be getting.....ideally? :)

Ideally, a Westy should get 100 mpg. :^) But most of the ones in good shape,
actually get around 20-22 mpg.
