Hi Brad,

I had the same problem with my 85 GL. What you can do is check the 
ignition switch because there is a white plastic part inside of it that 
maybe is worn out. When you replace it, the van should start with no 
problems. Unfortunately I don't remember the part number, but you can get 
it at any VW parts supplier.
Good luck!

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt;         After i do a long highway drive and come home and park the van, the
&gt; next morning the van has trouble starting.  I turn the key and nothing
&gt; happens, for a while and then it starts, after a particularily long trip the
&gt; van refused to start even after a long time of holding the key in the on
&gt; position.
&gt; 
&gt; I remember something being continually posted about the solenoid.  Is this
&gt; the problem?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in advance for your help.
