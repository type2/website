Hey everyone out there in computer land. My name is Erick and I have a 74   
camper, 73 thing, and a 86 jetta GLI.  All need work but they run.  I was   
wondering if anyone is going to the Buses on the BlueRidge on June 1,2.   
 I just found out about it and have sent away for information. I live in   
Greensboro, NC. and would Like to get a convoy of local people to drive   
to the show. Thanks,  ERick Sowder
