&gt; 1) the tranny seems to shift fine and pretty quietly, but I cannot get it
&gt;  to kick down into passing gear. Ie, when going up a hill, it won't
&gt;  automatically kick down into a lower gear. I can manually do this with no
&gt;  problem, but the manual says not to exceed 54 or so in second. The owners
&gt;  manual says to push the pedal &quot;pass acceleration&quot;, even if I go to the
&gt;  floor, it won't kick down. Is this normal?

No.  It should automatically kick-down when floored at a low enough speed.
 It sounds like your's needs adjustment.

&gt;  2) the rpm's at 65-70 mph are about 4000 or so. This seems close to the
&gt;  edge of the 'green' area on the tach. Is this ok/normal?

Yes.  This is the typical RPM range for this speed.

Good luck,
