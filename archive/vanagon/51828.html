Subject: Checking out Diesel Vanagons
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

I am going to look at an 82 Diesel this weekend. Is there anything
specific I should look at when I check it out? It is Lt. Brown/Brown two
tone (yuk!). Apparently the first owner was in the military and brought
it in from Germany. It doesn't have a middle seat. The current owner
lost his license. The only problem I know about (from my conversation on
the phone) is the trans is stuck in 4th gear. I've heard from other
listmembers that the likely culprit is a broken syncro hub. Has any body
repaired on of these trannys before? What specials tools are required?
Will keep ya'll posted on how things work out.
