er, well I'm not saying about the other stuff mentioed,   but the horn is
wired from the horn button down through the steering column out the bottom
 somewhere and  then to the horn with a brown wire.   When you tap the 
button
you ground it to the frame and beep!  If it doesn't come out under the front
of the car  you need  to run a new wire.  The other wire to the horn should
be the hot wire.   The grounding place under the horn button usually needs 
to
be cleaned off, too.   good luck!

ps.   Is Ben Pons'

 dealership still open in Amsterdam?  We've got a bus sold there in 1953
