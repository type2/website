And thus Thom responded:
&gt;...but at this point I would be wishin' I was home, and working on it_there_.
I'm sure most of us, if had the hind sight, would've taken different
routes in our own endeavours.  I felt this way just recently when undertaking 
the swapping of transaxles with (then) inadequate knowledge, tools and 
documentation.  Once in, I took the approach that Bob mentioned... One day/step
at a time.  In fact it was partially through Bob's encouragement and advise 
that saw me through on this.  (U mean I have to dissassemble those damn
reduction boxes, man!).  We can not expect these toils to always yield 
fruition, but on occassion they DO! (I'm really enjoying my daily driver....)

Keep on truckin', Bob
