Subject: I need help with 1961 paint code colours

re I need help with 1961 paint codes

The 1961 bus is off to the painters shortly. He wants to begin with the
wheels and bumpers, which I'm sending him next Friday. But, I don't have
the L codes for the correct colours. The body is Mango Green L346 and Sea
Gull Grey L 347, but does any one have any idea what the bumper and wheel
rims are?
