&gt;Just so I might get in the last word (ahem...yeah, right), let me

&gt;and had no problem. Of course, maybe my technique is a little better 
&gt;than Berry's...or maybe the fact that the 12-point screw heads weren't 
&gt;jammed on with guerilla force has something to do with it. If you do try 
&gt;the allen wrench, make sure it fits tight...and give up and go get 
&gt;Berry's 12-point, gold filled Snap-On right BEFORE the head strips, as I 
&gt;can only imagine how much fun that would be AFTER the head strips. (Now 
&gt;donning SnapOn Asbestos diaper ;) Joe

So much for your last word.  I've had both the 12 point fasteners and the
standard allen head fasteners on CVs on VWs that have owned.  I would not
necessarily assume that a particular VW is equipped with one or the other.
