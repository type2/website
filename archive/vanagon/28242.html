Subject:       '72 rear brakes, pushrods, compression

I finally got curious enough to take off the rear drums on my '72.  
everything is trashed.  backing plates, shoes, hardware, and 
cylinders.  the only saveable part is the adjusters.  I called on the 
cylinders and was quoted $32.00 each at my trusted parts place.  I 
nearly wet my self, im used to the normal $5-10 for domestics.  Is 
this an outrageous price or should i grin and bear it?  I don't 
expect shoes and hardware will be too expensive or hard to find but 
how about those backing plates?  what price range should i expect? 
can I find them new or are they a yard item?
    Over the weekend I also had a compression test done.  
    154 148 150 150  Do these values seem high? (bad gauge) or am i 
just in really good shape as far as that is concerned.  
    One more item of business.  Can leaky push rod tube seals be 
taken care of with out a major headache?  what is the best way to go 
about it?

thanks for any input.
Ed.
