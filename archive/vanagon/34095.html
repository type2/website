Subject: (1962) US brake parts dealers

Me again!

Can anyone send me phone numbers of VW parts dealers in the US that might be
able to ship the 1962 brake shoes &amp; cylinders over to the UK?
Even with phone-call &amp; shipping costs it sounds like it might be cheaper than
buying US imports from the (only) UK dealer that does them. 
Shipping could be a killer (+import duty?tax?). Worth asking tho...
