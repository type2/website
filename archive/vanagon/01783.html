&gt;&gt;I saw a receiver equipped hitch on a ~89 Vanagon in a parking lot that
&gt;&gt;looked like it was bolted to the tow-eyes of the rear bumper attachment.
&gt;&gt;Anyone have more clues on locating this particular hitch?
&gt;
Saw one of these around, looked clean and simple, ie. under an hour 
fabrication for a small one man welding shop, you take it home and paint it 
up. I'll leave a note on the Westies window, seems to be a regular at a 
hotel nearby, try to get a company name. Two bolts removed the bar/hitch 
completely, nice that way, maybe light duty only, legality?

I took a careful look at the VW installed hitch I have, Don Valley VW in 
Toronto. Could someone please look at their normal bumper mounts and see if 
a square cross tube (2&quot; x 2&quot;) is used, from bracket to bracket, bridging the 
space between the towing eyes. If so then it appears my trailer hitch is 
simply a tongue with ball welded/bolted ? to this cross bar. I don't want to 
drop my bumper just to check this out. My towing eyes appear stock, maybe 
there is something really simple here! Again, a visit to Lou's Welding and 
Taco Stand may be a good option, drive up with the rear bumper removed, and 
tell'em what you need.   tjs
