Subject:      Engine Swap

After much grief over the past year with head/over heating problems in
my 85 Westy I have decided, after much thought, to change over to a
Jetta engine.  I have an automatic, which I want to keep, and have
ordered a conversion kit from Kennedy, after talking with them several
times.  The necessary, I hope, diesel donor parts are also on their way,
and I will begin removing the wasserboxer in preparation for installing
the new Jetta engine, which I will select and purchase soon.  There
seems to be an abundance of these, which is one reason for the
selection.  I would greatfully appreciate any input as the the best fuel
injection system, exhaust manifold, and any other information anyone
wishes to share.  This will be a learning experience for me, and
hopefully give me a reliable Westy.  Please feel free to email me
direct to help me through this procedure, as I need all the help I can
get.  Thanks, Larry
