  I'll second that. I bought a 4.5&quot; grinder a few years ago and
  its found plenty of uses on the bus (stripping off old underseal, 
  polishing the paintwork if you get one with torque control, and 
  obviously cutting out all the rusty bits), but it goes without saying
  (so I'm going to say it), use *proper* ear protection when using
  a grinder. I didn't most of the time and now have tinitus (permanant
  ringing in my ears) which is bloody annoying. 

  Apart from that grinders are great. Especially when you can send 
  a nice golden stream of sparks across into the neighbours garden :)
