Subject: Help 84 Trans Leaking and Shifting Problems

Firstly, thanks to the folks who have replied to my previous post for help with the 
shifting problem in first gear. Seems that adjustment and or linkage parts may be the
culpret. If anyone else has experienced a problem shifting into 1st gear I would like 
hear from you and what the &quot;fix&quot; was.

Secondly, My trans (4 speed manual) is leaking at the shift rod coming out of the trans.
and at the drive shaft (driver side). Has anyone experience with replaceing these seals?
How difficult is it? Any special tools required (Bently calls out a few but they always
do it seems)? Proceedures (Bently is somewhat vague)?

TIA Again, this list is a savior to any Vanagon owner.
