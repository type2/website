Let us know when that fateful hour will be so we can chant mantras and 
sing hymns along with you...sort of a &quot;Dubs across America&quot; thing. But if 
you're in OK city, you'll need a permit! (what, it's not Friday yet?)

&gt; Seriously, everybody says I'm begging for trouble trusting this bottom end
&gt; to get me a hundred yards, and the more I look at it the more I think
&gt; you're all right. There's rust in there, there's discernable slop in one of
&gt; the rod bearings which means there was pounding on the other end, two of
&gt; the studs sheared when I took the exhaust off...

I'm glad to read your decision. Look at it like this, a good case costs 
over $100. So does the doghouse fan shroud (from supplier). Or one 
head...I'm sure you'll get your $$$'s worth out of this at least once.
