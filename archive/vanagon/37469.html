Subject: Re: four-position wiper stalk, 78 bus -Reply


SB&gt;If the old buses have this four-position stalk (I'm not sure if my '78 does
SB&gt;or not, I've never tried it) it would be cool if intermittent wipers could b
SB&gt;retro-fitted to old buses.  I remember someone mentioning something
SB&gt;about a wiper relay?  How would one go about finding out if one of the
SB&gt;newer relays would fit an older bus?  Intermittent wipers would be nice
SB&gt;:) .

Well, actually my dad swears that this was always an option for bays
with the
modern wiper stocks, from '74? or so on.  He says the standard switch
was
used and modified by pushing out a little blocking oin, that blocks the
delay
position then you bought the intermittent relay.   I'm looking into the
variable
intermittent relay retrofit this weekend, which is really swift if it
works.  You
pull into delay position, release, then pull back down when you are at
desired
delay.  When I bought the relay initialy for mom's '86 Jetta, box said
it fit all
water cooled VW's from '78 on and '78 and earlier with some sort of
modification.
Didn't say anything about fitting late A/C cars but who knows, all em
12V wiper
relays look the same.
