&gt;Dear Sir,
&gt;I was wondering if you could answer a question I have about my newly
purchased 73 &gt;westphalia. On long trips in my bus I discovered that the floor
gets quite hot between &gt;the ice box and the seat behind the drivers seat. I
was hoping that you might beable to &gt;tell me what is the cause of this heat
and if it is abnormal? Thanks for your time.

Hans,

Regretfully, my experience does not extend to the components installed in
Westphalia campers, but I am sure the composite experience of the Vanagon
List can provide some information.

I believe your vehicle is fitted with an absorbtion-type refrigerator, which
means it must generate heat to vaporize the refrigerant.  This is probably
the source of the heat you've noticed.  But my lack of experience makes it
impossible for me to determine if you are having a problem with the
refrigerator's exhaust vent.  As this may be a safety related item I have
forwarded your request to the list.  Please maintain contact with me until
the matter is resolved.

-Bob

To the Vanagon List:  Any information would be appreciated.  Please post to
the list so we can monitor Hans' progress in resolving the problem. -- rsh
