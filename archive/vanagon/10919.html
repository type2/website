&gt; One thing that you could do (It'll be almost as good as new) to salvage
&gt; your distributor, using thread inserts.  The type that works well is
&gt; E-Z LOK Thread Inserts.  You only need to use standard dills and taps.  

I can't get a dill to fit in my distributor housing; will a gherkin
work????

Sorry, couldn't help it.......
