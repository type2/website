Subject: Re: Cleaning Engine 80 Vanagon Camper

What I do is:

Get some plastic bread bags and rubber bands and cover anything that I
don't want to get wet: carbs, coil, distributer, electronic black boxes,
etc.

Then I go to a parts store and get some GUNK-style engine degreaser.

Then I go to a car wash that filters and recycles waste water. You don't
want the foul water flowing to your storm sewer and then into your local
lake, river, or ocean.

I wait for the engine to cool a bit and spray the degreaser on the bottom
of the engine. I spray anywhere there is oil accumulation. Be sure to spray
around the push rod tubes to get the cooling fans on the heads clean. Wait
a few minutes and then rinse with hot clean water. Repeat if necessary.

Remove plastic bags, start engine and take a drive to dry the engine.

&gt;I would like to clean my engine.  It's a 1980 Vanagon Camper.  Does anyone
&gt;have any good advice or things to look out for?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks....
