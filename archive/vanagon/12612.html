Hi, John--
I can be reached at: rmart_at_unm_dot_edu

I'll be away from all modems from March 7-13--on the road! An assistant driver
and I are delivering a '65 hardtop Deluxe to Ohio, and driving back two 
Syncros from Kentucky. Old Bus Review will be in the mail March 20.

I look forward to finding 637 messages from this list in my e-mail box! 
Yikes!
