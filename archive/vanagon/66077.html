Subject:      RE&gt; Addn'l seat for Westy

Based on the conjecture that the basic vehicle frame is the same for your =
camper as the standard Vanagon ---

I have added an &quot;8th&quot; seat to a standard 7 passenger Vanagon.  It is =
basically an addition next to the two person middle bench seat.  I think =
that something similar could be done to a Westy.

The middle seat mounts on rails that bolt to the floorpan.  In the Westy, =
as I visualize it, the area where the rails bolt to the floor pan is =
about in front of the sink/stove, probably where the table(?) goes???.

To add a seat, what I'd try to do ils get a set of rails from a wrecking =
yard along with the bolts that mount it to the floor pan, and a middle =
seat and the smaller bolts and clips that anchor it to the rails.  To =
access the rails on a Vanagon, you have to take up the aluminum =
&quot;threshold plate that anchors the edge of the carpeting at the sliding =
door opening. Roll back the carpet and unbolt the retaining bolts (10mm?) =
and clips and then slide the seat out the door.  The track unbolts from =
the floor pan with bigger bolts 15 or 17 mm????

I got hold of a middle seat that has the swing up armrest and fold =
forward seat backs.  I basically disassembled the seat, and sawed the =
structure pieces in half using hacksaw blades in a variable speed scroll =
saw at low speed setting.  Takes a bit of patiences to saw that heavy =
post between the two seat backs, but it is &quot;doable&quot;.  The frame that the =
bottom of the seat cushions mount to is simply 4 stamped pieces of sheet =
metal spot welded at the corners.  The welds are pretty easy to break =
with a cold chisel and then you can cut the long front and back pieces in =
half.  I used a &quot;propane&quot; torch that burns MAPP gas to braze the end =
piece back on.  The upholstry padding can be  cut in half and reused, as  =
can the upholstry seat cover that goes over the padding.  If you cut the =
frame correctly, the factory mounting where it slides onto the rails on =
the floorpan can be used, and the seat belt is attached to the seat =
frame.

What you can wind up with then, is a single seat, using factory mounting =
to the vehicle floorpan and with factory seat belt.  By cutting the =
mounting rails to the necessary and appropriate length, you should be =
able to mount the seat next to the sliding door in the space between the =
door and the sink/stove (says he who has never owned a westy).

This probably sounds more complex to do than it really is - I think that =
if you take a good look at how the original two person seat is put =
together, it is pretty straightforward on what and where to cut.

For those of you who want to mount this additional single seat &quot;end to =
end&quot; to the existing middle seat - my middle seat had a pipe welded to =
the frame that bent around (forward) to form the armrest at the end of =
the seat nearest the sliding door.  I had to cut this off with a hacksaw.

Anybody have any specific questions, feel free to e-mail them to me.
