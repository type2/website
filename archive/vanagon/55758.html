Subject: Westfalias out west

Hi fellow listmembers

I live in Montreal, in the east of Canada.  Over here, it is fairly
rare to see a Westy.  There are about 2 or 3 that I see now and then.

I just got back from a week out west in Calgary.  During that time, I 
saw roughly 2 dozen Westies, and no repeats!

I guess that's why they're called West-ies?
