Subject: RE: Serie -vs- Parallel

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;ANY two power sources connected in PARALLEL have the potential for circulating
&gt;&gt;current between that is wasted (i.e. not dissipated in the load). 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;--terry (my Gene Berg shifter finally goes in tonite)
&gt;&gt;

Well, aren't the batteries recharging each other that way? 

Inside the battery there are actually a bunch of small identical batteries 
connected in parallel to form a large battery. Connecting in PARALLEL internally
and externally seems to be the only difference. Just a thought.
