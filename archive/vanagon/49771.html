&gt;I'm the ecstatic new owner of a primo condition white '91 Westy Synchro with
&gt;47k miles.  It's my first synchro after having owned three Westies (two '72s
&gt;and one '84 Wolfsburg) and a '62 Bug. Will need to put new tires on it and
&gt;would appreciate suggestions for a good on and off-road tire that can get me
&gt;out of the Colo. rockies, down to southern Mexico (Oaxaca) and around steep
&gt;dirt roads, sometimes muddy.  Good gas mileage might be a consideration,
&gt;too. if that's a factor in tire selection. 
&gt;
The consensus seems to be BFG Radial All Terrain T/A, size 27 850 14. The
best price I've seen is mail order for $78 ea incl tax + $48 shipping for a
set (call 1 800 589 6789). Be sure to get a 5th tire for spare, this is a
syncro requirement. This is primariily an off-road tire, but has good
highway characteristics according to many on the list with this tire. I'm
running Michelin LTX 195 75 14 on my syncro Westy, but I don't do a lot of
steep muddy roads.
