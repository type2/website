Jerry &quot;Atari&quot; Dunham on Germans:

&gt;Then I must ask why Germans are such a large part of the Atari groups

Many Germans own Ataris. When I lived there, I knew about as many people
with Ataris as people with PCs. Almost no Macs. (that was over 4 years ago.)

&gt;I can think of is that this group has a much more social orientation, and
&gt;anyone only interested in the technical aspects of bus ownership has to
&gt;wade through all of that to find what he wants. 

Germans, too, can be social ;)  I must concede, however, that American
sense of humor is not easily accessible. It took *me* a couple of months
to get it--and I've known my American wife for 10 years now.

&gt;Any other theories?

How about conditional probabilities: if a German owns a computer, then
s/he is more likely to be hooked up to a net than an American. 

And: if a German owns a bus, then s/he probably uses it as a utility
vehicle and doesn't find much time to play with e-mail.
