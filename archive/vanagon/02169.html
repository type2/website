&gt;
&gt;
&gt;(1) Are we gettin enough traffic on this topic to merit getting off the
&gt;list? Non-participants comment please?
&gt;
&gt;(2) Im interested in something next spring but, being uncertain about my
&gt;plans that far in advance one uncertainty (May 95) is as good as another
&gt;(Fall 1995?) I'll be in Albany NY area and am interested in a Northen 
&gt;Canada leg as well as midwest. 
&gt;
&gt;More ideas:
&gt;
&gt;	create a mini news group for coordinating meeting, repair plans
&gt;while we are on the road (a couple of laptops to stay in the
&gt;info superhighway)
&gt;
&gt;	a sick-bus detail, maybe we can chip in for a stash of spares to
&gt;follow us around (lots of things to consider here - modest cash donation
&gt;for parts, hit up Recycled Inc for a bunch of spares in exchange for
&gt;:national advertising&quot;  :-), 
&gt;
&gt;	master list of repair shops (user  recommended) and
&gt;(ugh) VW dealers, good parts stores
&gt;
&gt;babble ......
&gt;
&gt;(can you tell i run a facility for a living ???)
&gt;

	Great ideas Stephen. Count me in if the loop winds near N.Wash,
	(heck why not S.Wash), or even into B.C.
