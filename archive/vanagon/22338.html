I don't know if this message will get out to anyone, but, here goes.  I'm 
Tim Casey in Minneapolis, new to the net and to the Vanagon.  I bought an 
'84 last month and I love it.  It's light blue, 7 passenger, rebuilt engine 
last summer.  My wife and I have always had great luck with VW's ('88 Jetta 
2-dr, 90 Jetta 4-dr, '86 Scirocco 16V, and now a '92 Cabriolet w/leather 
(heated seats!), CD, power windows...a luxury VW!, and my Vanagon).  I felt 
like I took a big risk buying the van - never heard anything good about 
them.  WOW there are some die-hard Vanogon lovers out there.  Mine has a 
number of little things wrong with it, chiefly, my lack of money to fix any 
of them right now.  I really look forward to taking it on the road 
somewhere.  Anyone want to have a VW campout near the Twin Cities?

The band I'm in, The Lovejoys, loves the van too!  All our equipment fits, 
with room for the four of us.  I hope my Vanagon  lasts a lot longer 
(93Kmi), and doesn't cost a fortune.  Keep in touch...
