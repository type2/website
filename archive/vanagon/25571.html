Subject: JC Whitney wider coolingfan.

Hi All,

Thanks to Tam Woodrum of the list i have the VW catalog
from JC Whitney, they stock a &quot;10mm wider fan&quot; for upright
engines, i've never heard/seen anything about such a fan
before.
I would be interested in a wider-than-stock fan to improve
cooling at lower engine speeds*, but i doubt if this fan is
really wider than a stock 1600 DP fan. Also, IF it's wider, will
it be nessecary to modifie the fanshroud?
If there is someone who has experience with one of these, please
let me know.

*Lower engine speeds: because i think that the cooling-air-flow at
higher engine speeds is restricted by the fanshroud, i even think
that there is little difference in cooling-air-flow between a stock-
and power-pully at higher engine speeds.

Brian.
