Subject:      Re: Auto or Man trans on '93 EV MV?

We had an auto trans 93 MV, and while the transmission itself does OK, the
engine mounts sag with time and xmit a lot of vibration when stopped at lights
with the xmission in gear. We'd routinely shift to neutral at lights so the
car would stop shaking and rattling. We also had the xmission control unit go
out at about 50k - replaced under warranty. (They replaced the trans first -
then realized it was the control unit.)

The new VR6 campers talk about their new engine-transmission mounts as
features in the sales brochure - and it is a big improvement.

What's the conventional wisdom on Automatic or Manual transmission in the
'93 Eurovan MV?  This is the 5 cylander engine.  (I've heard it referred to
as the &quot;Audi&quot; engine.)

I had a manual transmission that worked well.  I'm now looking at one that
is an automatic.  Any reason to stay away from the Automatic transmissions?

Thanks,

Carter
