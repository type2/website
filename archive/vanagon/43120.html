Subject: Dometic fridge part needed



I recently took my fridge (84 Westy) out to service it and on replacing
it one of the gas line nuts cracked (good job it cracked then rather than
on the hi-way!). If anyone on the list has a broken dometic fridge and could
donate/sell a part then please e-mail me.  The part I need is the copper pipe 
(plus nuts)that lies allong the top of the fridge and connects with the pipe to 
the tank at one end and at the other end connects to the on/off valve.

Thanks
David
