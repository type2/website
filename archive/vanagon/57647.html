&gt;COMMENT:  I have received this information through my wife's company's
&gt;          corporate IMS department.  This information is 3rd or 4th
&gt;          hand, so I do not know how valid it is.  This is simply
&gt;          meant to be a word of caution and not to create a panic.  I
&gt;          have no idea how transmitting viruses via e-mail would work,
&gt;          or if it would work.

Your wife's company's corporate IMS department are obviously idiots.
