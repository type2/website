&gt;I have a problem with any  VW made after 1967,

Why? Because they deleted the starting crank that year?

Or because that was the last year they offered hitching points for
the horse in front?    :)


Sorry, Jeffrey, couldn't resist a friendly tweak...

Splitties have great points, and I'd never cut them down in all seriousness.
Personally, I like driver's and passengers' windows that roll down, and
rear wheels that stay vertical regardless of load. I DON'T like having to
have a special (busmount) engine case, and not being able to mount many
of the aftermarket oil coolers/filters because the engine hanger gets in
the way.

You pays your money and you takes your choice...

Hee hee hee... my father grew up in Indianola... he agrees completely!  :^)
BTW, you forgot &quot;Economically stable&quot;.

Peace and love, bro.
