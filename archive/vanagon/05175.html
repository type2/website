Subject: VAG1367 Vanagon Tester

I purchased Saturday a used VAG1367 tester for the van that is shown in all
our manuals to test the basic operation of our Digifant Motors (1986-1991).
This is the $2,000 tester you can buy new from Zelenda, VW's tool seller.

Does anybody have any knowledge whatsoever about these things?

Does anybody else on the list have one of these things or lust after these
things or thought about these things?

Have I bought something of any value?
