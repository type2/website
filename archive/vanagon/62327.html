Subject: Re: Hornet car alarm?


Certainly a valid complaint.  Probably everyone has been annoyed by an 
alarm that won't quit with no owner in sight.  
I probably wouldn't hear my alarm going-off either:  I turn it on because 
I am leaving the van.  With nighttime in the big city being the 
exception, I wouldn't use it if I was within earshot.
Cheap or badly designed alarms keep sounding the siren.  Some sound 
pretty silly.  Mine stops after 1 minute and does not come back on.  I 
have had it adjusted so that it doesn't go off at the slightest bump or 
noise.
My alarm wouldn't stop someone from taking my things, however, unless 
well-prepared, the thief would have a hard time stealing the van since 
the alarm disables the primary starter circuit.  Like you, I minimize the 
amount of valuables in sight.  The alarm is just extra.
So, like most things, the whole alarm deal gets botched by those who cut 
corners and those who don't care.  Of course, the real culprit is the 
unknown thief lurking out there, not those who would attempt to preserve 
their hard-earned possessions.  
My favorite trick is to park next to some real expensive car, preferably 
one with no alarm or club, etc.  This works great with bicycles to :)
Sincerely,

&gt; I just have to put in my 2 cents!!! I have never, that's NEVER, seen an
&gt; owner (or anyone else, for that matter) respond to a car alarm. They seem
&gt; to be nothing but a source of irritation for the people who live near
&gt; where the vehicle is parked. My latest experience was with a mini-pickup
&gt; that owner liked to park as far away from his unit as he could so he
&gt; wouldn't be bothered by his stupid alarm playing seven different sounds!!
&gt; When we threatened to dismantle his whole truck be decided to move. I've
&gt; found the best way to minimize theft loss is to leave as little valuable
&gt; stuff as possible in the van. And as seen on Sixty Minutes, even with the
&gt; alarm blasting and people standing by, the thief goes about his business
&gt; of removing what he wants.
