You gibbed:
&gt; A quick job?  A QUICK JOB?  Are you on glue?

Well... as a matter of fact, we have a new printer and I've been 
sniffin' the paper and ... well....  not too bad &lt;sniff&gt;.  ;)

&gt; It took about 1 year and a half or so!!!  And thats working every single
&gt; day on it for 9 of those months!  Towards the end I was working on it
&gt; seven days a week, 12-16 hours a day!

Hmmmm... plus calculate the time you stopped to watch Andy Griffith Show
and Gilligan's Island reruns....  Yeah, that makes since!   ;)
