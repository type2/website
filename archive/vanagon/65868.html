As seen in the Austin, TX newspaper last week (please call them, not me),

`72 VW KOMBI BUS. Imported from Germany. All original equipment. Original
spare tire: never been on the ground! Clean.
Only licensed for two years. Was in storage since 1973. See to appreciate.
Asking $7,500. Engine like new. Only 30k miles.

VW RAIL. Lots of lights!  Dual double Weber carbs.  Turning brakes.  Runs
great! Neat toy! $2000.  264-0230.
