Subject: My '71 bus is pissed at me


&gt;
Well, some people came to look at my '71 bus over the weekend,
and naturally it chose to run like sh*t that day. They left, saying
&quot;I'll get back to you&quot; and other politenesses, which at least sounded
better than &quot;You lying, scumbag hose monster&quot;, which was maybe
what they were thinking after I'd told them it ran fine but had problems
with overheating and oil leaks.

I hadn't driven it for a while since getting the V6anagon, and hadn't
done a tune-up in a while, which became my first suspect. Popped off
the #2 plug wire, and it broke in my hand. Hmmm, maybe a leetle problem
with plug wires here... put them on my shopping list.

Put my wrench on the #2 plug, and that sucker did NOT want to come out.
By putting all the torque on it I could in that cramped engine compartment,
I could get it to turn ssslllooooowwwlllyyyy, fighting me every inch of
the way. Yes, I AM turning it in the right direction.

I'm about to put a cheater pipe on my wrench handle, but thought I'd
ask a few &quot;saner heads&quot; for advice before assaulting those soft aluminum
heads like that. The engine is stone cold, I haven't run it since the
weekend.

Anyone have any advice on coaxing a reluctant plug out of a VW? This
plug is actually the easiest one to get to in a bus-- #1 will be tougher,
being farther from the hatch and under the air cleaner mount (I've already
lifted out the air cleaner to get more room). Hope #1 doesn't decide to
display solidarity with its brother.

Frankly I'm not too far from yanking the engine and stuffing a correct
dual-port one in, in its place (this one is a '70 single-port 1600, with
Solex 30PICT-3 carb and standard VW bus muffler). Only the $$ are stopping
me, as usual. Ever notice how few truly rich people drive old VW buses?

Frustrated in San Diego,
