Subject: re: Bike carriers

    I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to fit a Yakima bike
    carrier on top of my 90 Westfalia. I would like to have the
    ability to carrier up to four bikes at a time or two bikes and a
    canoe. I realize that it would be a pain to remove all the
    carrier hardware everytime you wanted to pop the top but it may
    be worth it, if I can carry all this stuff. I would appreciate
    any suggestions on how folks carry this type of gear. I have a
    lot of Yakima hardware from the past and would like to utilize it
    if possible. Is a tailgate carrier a better alternative for
    bikes? Or maybe the trailer hitch type? 

A similar question arises: I just got a hitch carrier which holds 
three bikes (can also get one for four), and also folds down/detaches 
for rear hatch opening. For now I'll use it on my Jetta since the 
Westy doesn't have a hitch. I'm hoping to install a hitch plate on 
the front of the Westy for this - has anyone done this on an '88+ 
model with fiberglass bumpers? The only two options I could see are: 
a custom bracket bolted onto bumper supports (which would decrease 
already low ground clearance if it went below spoiler), or cutting a 
hole behind license plate and bolt a bracket into steel bumper 
support. This way, I figure it could still be removed and hidden 
behind the plate...

Any thoughts?
