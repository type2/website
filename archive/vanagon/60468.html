Subject: Removing fawcet assembly from sink-need help
Date: Sun, 25 May 1997 15:44:13 -0400

I think we need to remove the fawcet from the sink in our '85 Westy to get
at a leak which apparently is just at the base of the fawcet (underneath). 
It only leaks when the faucet is shut off and it's under pressure-hitched
up to city water.  You can see the drips from under the cabinet but can't
get to the problem.
I remember someone cautioning about taking them out, not to break some tab?
 Can anyone give me directions on how to remove it in one piece? PS new
(potable) water pump works great!
TIA
