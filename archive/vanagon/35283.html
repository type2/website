Subject:       engine wont crank over

I left my '72 sit in the drive way the past couple of months while it 
is awaiting a c.v. repair.  I have started it every week or two and 
it always started right up.  last weekend it was up to 50 degreese 
after a spell of -10s so i decided to let it run for a while.  The 
bus didn't seem to have any juce at first so i hooked up the charger 
and tried again after about 5 minutes.  it started right up.  It 
stalled when i put it in gear and I havn't been able to start it 
again for the life of me.  when i turn the key the dash lights come 
up reluctantly and i will usually get a click out of the back but 
nothing hapens.  i figured that the batery was dead but several hours 
on the quick charger didn't help at all.  I turn the key to the run 
position and the lights take a second to come on, (fairly dim) then i 
try to start it and everything shuts off.  Could i have frozen my 
batery? or is something else going on here?  why did it start the 
first time?
Help.
Ed.
