Subject: Re: VW noise recordings (PROGRESS UPDATE!)


I gave Der Wagonwerks a call and orderd a tape too....the guy on the other 
end is having fun with this! I aked to order the Muir VW noise tape...and he 
said...&quot;Let me guess...you got my number on the internet, huh?&quot;

Just think...this guy was probably sitting on a bunch of these tapes 
thinking...&quot;How the hell am I gonna get rid of these...&quot; when all of a 
sudden the internet rears its ugly head!
