Subject: '81 Westy:???

Hello friends:

My wife and I just bought an '81 Vanagon, and I was wondering what the top 
recommended cruising speed is.  The guy we bought Edward from sez not to go over 
60mph, but it feels good if I do...aren't these high-rev engines? Your advice 
regarding 2000cc FI &quot;power?plants&quot; would be most appreciated.

For air cooled beasties:  We have a 12vDC-120vAC inverter....what do you think 
of rigging up some kind of air-conditioning coil system in the cooling air 
ducts?  I was thinking that it would be thermostatically controlled, and would 
run via an electric motor from the inverter.  Would this be more trouble than is 
worth? Would the few degrees of difference on hot days help?
