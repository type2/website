Subject: 1984 Westfalia

I have an opportunity to
purchase a 1983 Westfalia and
I am soliciting any
opinions on it or any
general comments, positive
or negative.  I have the car
for a week now.  The brakes
feel soft to me so I&quot;m going
to have them checked out.
Also, I don't believe the
refrigerator is working.  I
wonder if it's repairable.

Please respond to me
privately at
fred_at_caliban.ucsd_dot_edu or
fred_at_pooh.ucsd_dot_edu
as I'm not signed on to
the list  --- yet.

If there's interest in a
summary of the comments,
I will post one.

Thanks very much,
Fred Julilan
