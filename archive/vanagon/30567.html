I managed to get my '74 Camper up to around 80 by drafting behind my 
friend's Camaro down a mountain pass.  I don't recommend this unless you 
have a brand new steering system(I don't, and man was I nervous).

Without the assistance I can hit about 73 or so.

Also, I want to fix my heater so that I can actually use the defroster to 
defrost my windshield.  Am I asking too much, or is this possible?  I 
live in Seattle and as you all probably know, it rains alot here.

Thanks,
Craig
