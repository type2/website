d by your e-mail servor.  If you receive this directly,
let me know and I will try again.  But if you see this message only via the
Vanagon List then you must resolve the difficulty with your e-mail delivery.
 It would not be proper to use the list for lengthy response to questions not
shared with them.

Sorry for the wasted bandwidth.  I am trying to re-establish contact with Mr.
