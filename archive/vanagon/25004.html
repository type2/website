Subject: need advice on timing marks &amp; dwell meter
Date: 17 Sep 1995 20:32:21 GMT


	Yesterday, I went over the micro bus, adjusting, tuning and basically
getting everything in order. As the new owner, a big part of this is
acquiring a familiarity with the vehicles own idiosyncracies. Over all I
think everything went well enough, but a couple of questions have arisen that
I would really appreciate help with. 
	-MThe first deals with the distinction between finding TDC and the 10DG BTDC
marking. I know the manuals (Muir, Hayes and Chilton) lay out the procedure,
but the problem I have with interpreting their instructions is that the  pull
wheel on the bus (and my bug) has only two notches, which I assume to be 7DG
and 10DG respectively. So how then does one locate TDC?
	Please correct me if I'9ve got it wrong, but rather then use the split in the
crank case as a reference, just a tweak to the left of the crack is a clearly
made punch mark, and to the right of the crack, yet a further distance then
the other, is a second punch mark. I used the right hand notch aligned with
the left hand punch as the reference to TDC and used the same timing notch on
the right hand punch as reference to the timing position. (I hope this is
coming across, as I'9m worried that I might be doing damage if I got this all
wrong). No manuals I have, and I'9ve got stack of them, makes any reference to
punch marks in the case, yet they'9re on the bus and my '956 sedan. Is this a
scandinavian thing?
	Supporting my interpretations are two very crudely etched scratches on the
fly wheel which came pretty close, (they'9re kind a'9 giggly not I didn'9t have
too much confidence in their accurancy) to TDC and the 180DG marking.

	-The second problem is about using a tach-dwell-volt meter to correct the
point'9s gap. Which is more accurate: physically measuring the 4 mm gap
between the points or measuring a 50DG dwell, +/-2DG?  I figure the dwell meter
must be more accurate, so I went to the FLAPS to pick up a replacement unit.
They had the same as what I'9ve got, made by Equis (I think), through the
blister pack I could see all the settings for various voltage, yet a sticker
placed on the package said for 12 volt applications only! I asked but...
What'9s the picture here, can one get a 6 volt dwell meter?
	I am pretty worried that I might be assuming a bit much with my
interpretations and will be grateful for any opinions and comments any one
would care to share.
