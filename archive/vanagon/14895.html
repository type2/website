Subject: My Cool Sway Bars

Well, I got those sway bars on my '77.  I ended up just using 
some great big hose clamps for the front end.  The rear went fine, but the
bracket that bolts to the suspension had to be trimmed.  It was interfering
with the CV joint.  Also, I think I am going to get
some washers to put under it, and use a longer bolt.  The suspension
piece that it bolts to is not flat.  It just doesn't look as good
as it should.  If you have ever put sway bars on you will
know what I mean.  Oh well, that should be easy.  Overall, the sway
bars really help.  The van feels much more controllable.  It feels
like the tires would be more likely to slide rather than the van
tipping during hard cornering.  High side winds are not so bad
either.  Don't worry though, that bus feel is definetely still there.
