Rachel,

It is easier to remove the engine from a van than it is from a bug.
You will need a scissors jack, and a regular floor jack...you can
borrow mine...

You will need the scissors jack to hold up the transmission while
the engine is being removed and while it is out...

Pop off the back bumper...does yours still have one? Then remove
the four bolts that hold the rear engine compartment section
in place...

Undo the four bolts and slide the engine backwards.

If you had a split window van it would be even easier...you just
unbolt the engine, prop it up on a milk crate with a piece
of 2x4 and then roll the van forward.
