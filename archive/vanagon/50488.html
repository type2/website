&gt;   One of the biggest problems we run into is that the Fuel Ijector lines 
&gt; need to be lengthened. Other than that, a little fabricating of the 
&gt; intake to the manifold and you have a very nice running Vanagon.

Sounds like you are talking about CIS injected engines. My digifant 
injected engine didn't need any mods to the injection system. there is 
some debate about which system is the &quot;best&quot;, not having high press gas 
lines across the engine is one point in favour of digifant.

&gt; 
&gt;   We've played with a few different exaust systems too, and found that 
&gt; the stock Diesel works the best!  Every other kind we've tried has 
&gt; broken quickly.
&gt; 
although I have retained the stock diesel exhaust system, i have to 
disagree with that last statement. If the exhaust system is designed to 
allow for some movement, it will last as long as the stock system. 
Allowing for movement is important, I've seen one conversion with a 
cracked exhaust manifold ( a dasher manifold).


&gt;   I get to drive these Conversions, and I've driven Vanagons with V-6 
&gt; Power plants too, I Really like the &quot;Feel&quot; of the In-Line 4 Cylinder 
&gt; engine in a Vanagon!

What I don't like about my conversion is its tendencey to be a bit buzzy 
at certain rpms. maybe more sound insulation would help, or maybe its the 
k&amp;n air filter, or maybe its the stock exhaust.
