So Scott Sminkey - Sustaining Eng Group says:
&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt; 
&gt;   Well, I have my '91 Vanagon Camper in for 60,000 mile service and -- 
&gt; surprise, surprise -- the service guys found oil in the coolant (or was
&gt; it coolant in the oil) and are quite sure I have a small head gasket
&gt; leak. I've heard enough about this on the list that it isn't entirely
&gt; unexpected. :-(  I'm not too pleased, though, since I have always kept
&gt; an eye on the coolant level, used nothing but Autobahn coolant, had it
&gt; flushed and replaced by the dealer after two years and I'm now on a one-
&gt; year schedule for this.
&gt; 

Hi Scott,

Sorry to hear about your '91 camper problems.  I don't suppose you're
still under warranty or anything.  If so, you might have a recourse
in pursuing the problem.  Otherwise, I think you're stuck.  I'd really
interested in hearing VWs explanation as to why this happened in such
a short amount of miles.  I have 75K on my '91 camper with no sign of
leakage (knock extra hard on wood).  

Really sorry this happened to you.

Steven
