        Do you have a phone number or address for Python?  A way to get in
touch with them or get a catalog?

&gt;  Could this be anything but the ECU not properly dealing with the
&gt;  signal from the oxygen sensor?  Everyone says don't suspect the ECU
&gt;  until you've tried absolutely everything else, I can't guess what else
&gt;  it could be.  HELP! &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well quit guessin' and start BETTIN' !!!
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If anyone decides to start buying replacement ECUs, you might seek out an
&gt;auto parts store that sells Python brand remanufactured stuff for VW.  I see
&gt;in their product line catalog that they offer a remanufactured ECU for the
&gt;Vanagons.  I priced these a few months ago and the cost seemed very
&gt;reasonable to me, I don't recall the exact figure I was quoted. I think I'll
&gt;buy a spare at some point down the road as a hedge against being Henried
&gt;(Found On Road Dead).
&gt;
&gt;I have used Python brand remanufactured Injectors and Fuel Pump and they seem
&gt;to be of high quality, no problems.  Saved beaucoup bucks over new Bosch or
&gt;Dealer Gold Plated Bosch.  FYI, they also do Air Flow and Mass Flow Meters
&gt;for the Bosch FI systems.
&gt;
&gt;In Colorado Springs I get this Python stuff at a parts place called Proline.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;On the subject of parts cost,  I was making the rounds of the two VW dealers
&gt;in town yesterday looking for dealer only doodads and binkuses and discovered
&gt;one dealer was quoting me full dealer list price sort of prices (what else?)
&gt;and the other place was quoting me double dealer prices!   It goes to show
&gt;that it pays to shop even at the VW dealer.  Apparently they can make up
&gt;whatever price they want for stuff.  (If in Colorado Springs Phil Winslow VW
&gt;was the double everything priced guys, Heuberger was the regular list price
&gt;guys, BTW.  The gal at the Heuberger parts counter is a breadloaf bus person,
&gt;very helpful on bus/van parts)
