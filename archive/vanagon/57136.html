Wellllll ! I supposed I have to get into this fray.

Been thinking about camper conversions and stuff, seeing as I have a 
spare '80 Westi working hard as the kids playhouse.  I had a '64 
Deluxe that I added some stuff to to become my camper, long since 
gone unfortunately.

One of the things that a real door can do that a slider can't, is to 
HOLD something.  I had a shelves on my doors that could be fixed 
in the horizontal position.  While closed the rear door could be used 
as a small table for a book, game, eating etc.  While open it 
supported a portable stove.  The front served as a cutting table, 
snack tray, etc.

While not being used, the shelves folded down, out of the way, 
against the door.

I've seen a cabinet attached to a door.  When open the cabinet is 
outside, thereby freeing up space inside.

I'd be really nifty to graft the doors onto a working slider, Wha hoo,
the best of all worlds!  Sometimes it is a GOOD thing I don't have a 
welding rig!  Any donors out there?

&gt; just curious....Why do you want to get rid of your slider??
&gt; there's no space advantage to a &quot;swing out&quot; door/s.
