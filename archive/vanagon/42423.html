&gt;The engine won't idle below 1300 or so RPM.  It's a steady idle and the 
&gt;engine runs very smoothly, but ideally the idle should be around 900 
&gt;RPM. The dwell is a constant 59 degrees.  The timing is set at 7.5 
&gt;degrees  BTDC at 900 RPM.  (I managed to get the idle down temporarily 
&gt;to 900 RPM by unplugging the top air hose to the decel valve and 
&gt;obstructing about half of the opening, leaving it partially open.)  The 
&gt;bypass screw (idle) is turned all the way in.  I've checked everywhere 
&gt;for vacuum or air leaks.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody got any ideas?

Either the decel valve or the auxilary air regulator may not be closing
completely.  Check these out.
