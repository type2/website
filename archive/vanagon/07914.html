Subject: Re: Trip Planning

wow! :) with a list like that, you'd really be set. One thought, being a
cheapie....i scam all the paper towels from the gas station i can! :) Those
thingies prove real darn useful i.e. misc. oil leaks etc. etc. I would also
add take some white litium grease on your trip. Infinatley useful! I used
to know a guy who carried a spare engine in the back of his van!


&gt;So Scott.Marks_at_gsa_dot_gov says:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm planning on driving my '65 Camper from Dallas, Texas up
&gt;&gt; to Michigan for Christmas and I would like to make it with
&gt;&gt; the bus and I in one piece.  Anybody have any suggestions
&gt;&gt; about stuff I should check out before the trip? I am mildly
&gt;&gt; mechanical but am not opposed to getting it checked out
&gt;&gt; professionally.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any Ideas???
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;MMMMmmmmm.... I can think of a few..... ;)
&gt;
&gt;This is my list of essentials for air-cooled VW traveling:
&gt;It may seem like you'd need a trailer to haul all this stuff
&gt;but it really isn't that much stuff.
&gt;
&gt;Jumper Cables - Don't leave home without em'.
&gt;Sockett Set  - Misc. bolt tightening.
&gt;Wrench set  - Misc. bolt tightening.
&gt;pliers and crecent wrench  -  Various tighting/bending jobs.
&gt;Screwdrivers -  flat &amp; phillips &amp; allen - tighting misc. screws.
&gt;Duct Tape -  Holds things together.  Patch hoses.  Keep people quite.
&gt;electrical tape - Ad hoc wire fixing.
&gt;wheel bearing grease - Various wheel maintenance
&gt;brake fluid  - Low brake fluid.  Spongy brake pedal.
&gt;matches/lighter - If its cold and you need a light.
&gt;   (This assumes you will be away from the car)
&gt;toilet paper - Need you ask?
&gt;12V test light. - To test out electrical problems.
&gt;Volt/ohmmeter. - Better electrical problem tester.
&gt;spare auto wire - For testing or replacement.
&gt;Wire cutters/strippers for wire.
&gt;Rope  -  Emergency pulling, holding up things etc.
&gt;walking shoes  -  It could be a long walk.
&gt;hat - Keeps the rain or sun off when your walking.
&gt;Jacket  -  It gets cold sometimes.
&gt;Spare parts:
&gt;
&gt;  Plugs, points, condensor, cap, throttle cable, clutch cable
&gt;  wiper blades, fuel injection parts (injectors, gas line,
&gt;  sensors; especially for older vehicles).
&gt;
&gt;  Bring along any spare part that you think might be getting to
&gt;  the end of it's life.  This could be a starter, alternator or
&gt;  a fuel pump etc.  If you're short on dough, then get a used
&gt;  working part and limp it till you can replace it.  I'd never
&gt;  go out on the road with questionable brakes or wheel bearings.
&gt;  It just isn't safe.  Make your Momma and Pappa proud and get
&gt;  those brakes and bearings fixed so they won't worry about you.
&gt;
&gt;Spare belts  -  You won't have to wait for the garage to order them.
&gt;                (sometimes it takes days)
&gt;Good Spare tire (fully inflated)  -  Nothin' like a useless spare to ruin
&gt;                                     your day
&gt;Make sure your jack works.  Grease it.  -  Changing a tire is hard enough
&gt;                                           already.
&gt;Change your oil, oil filter and fuel filter  - Start out right.
&gt;Carry 3 quarts extra oil. -  In case you lose your oil for any reason.
&gt;Have a tune-up done or do it yourself.  - If you drive an air-cooled VW
&gt;                                          you should at least learn how to
&gt;                                          tune it yourself.
&gt;align and balance the tires. - So you don't rattle your nerves. ;)
&gt;Have the headlights aimed (With the car loaded) - Mis-aimed lights are
&gt;                                                  annoying
&gt;flashlight + spare batteries - You don't want to be in the dark.
&gt;A second flashlight. - In case the first don't work.
&gt;Sleeping bag. - It gets mighty cold at night.
&gt;Gallon Jug of drinking water - You could get thirsty or worse dehydrated.
&gt;First Aid Kit - Always
&gt;bailing wire - To hold things together.
&gt;lug wrench - To remove wheels.
&gt;3' of pipe to put over lug wrench to loosen stubborn bolts.
&gt;food: granola bars and such. - You always get hungry when your stuck somewhere
&gt;Liquid Wrench - For those tough bolts.
&gt;WD-40 - Gets the grease off.
&gt;Spare fuses - Always have them.
&gt;Spare bulbs - Various ones for all the lights in your car.
&gt;Spare cash - Some people don't take credit cards or checks.
&gt;Waterless hand soap - To get the grease off your hands.
&gt;Book to read - To pass the time while you're waiting for the tow truck.
&gt;               (or waiting for someone else to go get a tow truck)
&gt;               Or you could read the manual for your car and find out the
&gt;               things you should have been doing for it.
&gt;Battery Terminal cleaner thingy - You know, the one with the wires in the
&gt;doo-hickey.
&gt;Paper towels - There nice for cleaning up.
&gt;Small tarp - To put on the ground so you don't get too dirty.
&gt;Grubby cloths - To get dirty in.
&gt;Rags - To wipe off things on the car.
&gt;Gloves - For things to hot to handle.  Also for heavy duty stuff.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Enjoy the trip!
