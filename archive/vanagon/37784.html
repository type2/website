Okay, okay, I'll bite:

What is a flaring tool and a buble-flare adaptor?

(Or did you just want to say 'ubiquitous'? :-)

&gt;If you plan to maintain your Volkswagen yourself your tool kit should include
&gt;a flaring tool and the necessary bubble-flare adapters.  Flaring tools are
&gt;ubiquitous and JCW has the bubble-flare adaptors at a reasonable price.
