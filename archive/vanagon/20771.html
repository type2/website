&gt; How do you tell? Roll it over and tickle it's belly?  ;-)

A friend of mine used to do this trick with an orange to determine its sex. You 
take an exacto knife and score the skin of the orange in the shape of human body
outline - kind of like police do at the scene of an accident. The midsection (or
&quot;crotch&quot;) of the little orange man is placed directly over the navel of the 
orange.

OK, you can probably see what's coming, but I'll continue anyways. Peel the dude
away from the rest of the skin, being particularly careful around the navel 
area. If the skin rips and you end up with a hole in the middle of your figure, 
the orange is female. Males are equally obvious, in fact some large fresh 
oranges are quite well endowed.

With a little practice you can kind of play God and force the outcome, but the 
entertainment factor is not decreased.

What this has to do with an orange bus I have no idea. Maybe you can tell the 
gender by the shape of the tailpipe...who knows.

-Erik.
