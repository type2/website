Can someone please confirm if these bounced messages also made it to 
the list in the normal form?  I would hate to read them all but, if I 
thought there was something I was missing, I would.  Since the subject 
line has the [f] mark I will tell a short story.  They drained or 
flushed the hot water pipes on campus here this week.  From the 
newspaper it sounds a little like bleeding a Vanagon coolant system.  
Anyways, they forgot to close a few valves before they cranked things 
back up.  $100,000 damage to one building alone.  The other one they 
haven't gotten into yet until they are sure about asbestos, etc.  It 
is the one that most of the net stuff and mainframes on campus.  That 
is why I was off line part of yesterday.  :(
