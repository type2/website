I've found a solution for this.  You can buy sheets of white magnetic
material from Dick Blick.  I stuck some stickers to the material, and then
used an Xacto knife to cut out the stickers.  Result:  Nifty magnetic
stickers that I can put anywhere!

Unfortunately, the oval stickers are harder to cut than rectangular
stickers.  I took my time, however, and the result was pretty pleasing.

&gt;The costs are as follows:
[...]
&gt;or 25 beautiful stickers for $25.00
&gt;additional stickers will be roughly $2.00 each.

That doesn't make sense... If I buy 25 it's $25, but if I buy 26, it's $28?
