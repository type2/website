Subject: door hinges, arrgg

          i've spent the last couple weeks getting my newfound cargo
          doors ready for the '66 kombi.  last night i attempted to
          loosen the large phillips screws that hold the hinges to the
          body but only managed to bust one loose.  the others remain
          firmly intact, but one slightly stripped.  i tried the
          impact.  i tried the breaker bar.  i know i'm using the
          correct bit.  the biggest problem is not being able to get a
          straight shot on the screw due to the side rail where the
          seal rides.  i contemplated bending this out of the way but
          thought better of it and went to bed instead.  any
          suggestions are welcome.  i also thought about heat but
          wouldn't want to ruin paint on the door jam.
