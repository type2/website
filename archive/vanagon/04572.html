Subject: beep and wave


To the owner of the whith 84-85 westy who honked and waved at me in front 
of McCowan Station on saturday night... I'm sorry that I gave you the 
finger.  I thought that you were honking to display your pissed offedness 
at my being stopped in a legal stopping zone.  I didn't look to see who 
you were and what you were driving until too late.  I doubt that you're 
on the net... but I hope you under stand

Thom...
