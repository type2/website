Subject: BMW: Dalton Hwy (aka North Slope Haul Road)

For those considering riding all the way north to Prudoe Bay, AK this
summer, an article in today's Anchorage Daily News indicated that The
Fairbanks Borough voted to close the last 8 miles of the Dalton Hwy to
visitor traffic. Although contrary to the 1994 decision by the Alaska
Legislature to open the hwy to the public, it appears that dipping your
toes in the Arctic Ocean in Alaska next summer might not be an option.
