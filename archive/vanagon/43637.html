Subject: Yet another VW Url...

Surfing around I stumbled into Jeff Frohwein's Beetle Technical Page.  This
may be old news to some of you but I had never encountered it prior to
today. The cross reference to the VW magazine articles by subject is kinda
nice but could be quite dated. I haven't taken the time to check it out in
depth.

This site  includes:
*Article Index that spans many years of popular VW magazine issues.

*Specification Tables
*Beetle Specifications:
(all kinds of sub categories)

*Year-to-Year Model Changes
(all kinds of sub categories)
