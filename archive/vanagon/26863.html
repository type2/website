Subject: rear axle clicking?

Happens only when in gear, was much noiser when I shifted down into 
second tonight, goes
click. click. click.
under about twenty, goes
click, click, click 
up to about forty and then it's
click!click!click!click!click!

There's a VW dealer within walking distance of where I'm temping, gonna 
drop it off there when they open. Guessed at CV joint(s). Any gratuitous 
advice welcome from anyone whose carpal tunnel isn't too bad tonight...

Thanks!
