So Gerald Skerbitz says:
&gt; 
&gt; I waved at a Eurovan MV yesterday, and he honked and waved back!  &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; 

Hmmm, what a rare bird.  Of all the EV I've seen while driving my van,
not one has waved.  I'm not even sure they've even looked.  Totally
clueless.  

I'm sure if you're in Mass-of-two-sh*ts, you can attribute it to 
the snob factor....   ;p   ;)
