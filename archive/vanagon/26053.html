Subject: Re: GIFTS TO BOB (was: Grendel, Tuesday II)


&gt;&gt; An EXCELLENT idea. Does anyone have the host's address??? He is not the
&gt;&gt; one with the shop, I know... correct me if I'm wrong, but he has been
&gt;&gt; quite a nice guy. Everyone has limits, tho... the host deserves
&gt;&gt; recompense, just as Bob deserves our support.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Please, anyone on the list who has the address, please post it, or
&gt;&gt; send to me directly? Thanx a 10**6.
&gt;
&gt;since this was my idea, i'll respond.  bob doesn't wish for us to do
&gt;that.  he's taking care of things on that end re: debt to host.


Party Pooper.   :^)

Well, we should have a triumphant procession for Bob, once he brings
Grendel home with flying colors, despite all the trials and tribulations
he's gone through. Yeah, I know, he went into it with eyes open, and
probably should have cut and run half a dozen times.

But what guts, perseverence, skill, and patience this man has
shown. After the clothes and tools have dried off, the bills have
been paid, and the pneumonia has been cured...

What a grand adventure this has been.
