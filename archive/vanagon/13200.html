Subject: Re: Anyone know how to tune a judson supercharger?


I'm not sure if your judson will work on the 1500cc engine...or
at least work to its full potential. From what I recall the 
Judsons were set up for the 1200cc 36 and 40hp engines. Those
uses small manifolds as well as the 28 PICT carbs.

1500 cc engines used a larger manifold as well as a larger 30pict
carb. If you use the 28PICT carb on your 1500 cc engine, then you
are in effect chocking off the air to your engine, and probably
won't get the full effect of the supercharger.
