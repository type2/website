Let me tell you I am going thru the same thing.  I am located in NY and 
so far I have gotten the following prices:
Pep-Boys:355.00 + exchange + alignment + 3 hours labor
WesternAuto Parts America : 299.99 + exchange
VW: 950 for entire job
Sears:850 for entire job

Without the exchange, there is a $100.00 added charge but you get it back 
when they receive the old part.

Also keep an eye out for rebuilt ones.  From what I hear, the rebuilt 
ones are just as good for half the price.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; Hi I'm Chris Gibbs, another Brit' living up here in Ketchikan, Alaska.  
&gt; I came accross this list via the Westfalia Owners Page!
&gt; 
&gt; I have an '88 Westfalia with around 250,000 on the origional engine, no 
&gt; re-build yet(other than new heads about 12 months ago).  Other than the 
&gt; usual problems the vehicle has been superbly reliable and easy to find 
&gt; parts for and repair.
&gt; 
&gt; Alas, about 2 weeks ago I noticed a small pool (P/S fluid) under the 
&gt; power steering rack, &quot;its grown since then.&quot;  Well, I called the usuall 
&gt; VW sources that I know of on the west coast and got basically the same 
&gt; answers.
&gt; 
&gt; The VW dealers are all asking for the old rack in exchange for a new 
&gt; one!  The new ones are coming from somewhere over on the east coast?  
&gt; All said that the racks are back ordered!  Oh yeh, they wanted $850 plus 
&gt; tax plus the old rack in exchange.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anybody know where these replacement racks are coming from?  Is 
&gt; there a way to get my old one re-manufactured?  With me being stuck out 
&gt; here I am at the mercy of UPS &amp; FedX anyway, so it doesn't matter where 
&gt; the service or parts are coming from!
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that someone can help, thanks for listening!
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Chris Gibbs

&gt; 
&gt; PS.  If anyones interested I've found a supplier for really neat propane 
&gt; heaters that fit under the rear bench seat.  They're from the UK, use 
&gt; virtually no propane and come with a nifty little thermostat that you 
&gt; can put up on the wardrobe of a Westy.  Mine cost me about $500 
&gt; including shipping (worth every penny up here too)!!!!!!
