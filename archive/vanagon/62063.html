Subject: EV Mirror Questions

Hello All,

Someone or something bumped and broke the lower 1/2 of the bracket to my
passenger side mirror.  Anybody been there, done that yet?  It's always
nice to get some info before diving into a project cold.  Also on that no=
te
does anyone have info on a shop manual yet?  Bentley or even Haynes?  I'd=

think that you could get a UK version at least since the vans have been o=
ut
for a number of years on the other side of the pond.

Thanks

Ken
