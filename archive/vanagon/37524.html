Subject: spin-on filters

	Other than seeing it at the dealer, I don't know much more
about the spin-on filter adaptor for uprights. They didn't have any
in stock when we visited. Maybe David Schwartz or some other San Diegan
could be persuaded to make a research trip? 

	Apparently there is a late model upright 1600 case for Vanagons 
with a spin-on filter boss. Anyway, my beloved brother did some research 
and found:
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

        Throughout the 13 model years of the Vanagon, there were
1600cc carbureted &quot;base models&quot; available in Europe. The engine case
was essentially the same as any late model bug or case you've ever
seen, EXCEPT that VW FINALLY got around to casting in a provision for
a spin-on, full-flow OIL FILTER. This is one goodie that the beetle
never had, and the bus didn't have until the Type 4 motor was
introduced in '72.

How to get one? I found a VW agency in the UK that would ship to the US,
but they wanted-gasp!- US$1800 for a new case!

Yep, I've looked high and low in the US for the way-cool
1600cc Vanagon engine cases, and no luck. It would be easy if they
sold 'em in Canada, but they never did. I only learned about them in
the Haynes manual for the 80-83 air cooler Vanagon, which was written
in the UK. (Actually, I've found the Haynes manuals to be a storehouse
of photogs and specs on tasty, european only VW parts and
accessories.)

	This is all I know about the subject, see your air-cooled
Vanagon Haynes manual for more!

	Cheers!
	Bill
