Subject: VR6 Camper on the Dealer's Lot!

Went to pick up my EV at the Asheville NC dealer after a recall repair and
what's sitting there but a new Winnebago VR6 Eurovan!  Looked good -- body
was white as was all trim.   The hood does extend a little further than my
'93, but less than I thought it would.  The dash was a little different,
but the interior front was essentially the same as my '93 GL.

 The only price was the &quot;Conversion Price&quot; sticker from Winnebago
indicating a figure of $9600 or so.  The adjacent factory VW sticker had no
price and said &quot;For transport only&quot;, so I don't know what the total price
is.
