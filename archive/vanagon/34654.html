Subject: Parts Is Parts Experiences??

(I just got a old woodslat westy roofrack for my 1965 Westfalia)

Any one out there have any experience/dealings with Parts is Parts (they
reproduce wood slat roofracks for pre 68 westy's)??? I can't get to their
web page (DNS unknown message) and when you send e-mail to them it bounces
back. I am about to give up on them finding the few pieces I need for my
OEM Westy rack.

Anybody have any thoughts on how to polish/clean up the &quot;chrome/aluminum&quot;
thingy that keeps the luggage from sliding of the side off the rack ( i
hope that people know what i am talking about i am not feeling too
descriptive today), you know that decorative aluminum thingy?? My
aluminim/chrome is kinda grungy and I am looking for advice on how to
polish it up without scratching it up?? ANybody done this??
