&gt;Guaranteed that the 18 year old would take the bus, the ex would get
everything else including child support. You'd be left holding a thumb up to
hitch hike and stand like Al Bundy sits on the couch (with your hand in your
Bumwoolens! I think you are better off where you are. Kiss the wife for me!

&gt;
&gt;As a final touch, I'd dump my wife, and find a 18 year old (to
&gt;avoid statutory rape laws) Blonde, Big Breasted, Bikini Bus
&gt;Bimbo. 
&gt;
&gt;Of course after doing all that, my bus would be guaranteed to
&gt;make it to the cover of VW T&amp;A...oops Trends!  ;-)
