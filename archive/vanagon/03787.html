We looked at one in the showroom.  We currently own a Eurovan MV with the
Weekender package.

&gt; 
&gt; Last saturday we test drove the new 95 EuroVan Winnebago Camper with an
&gt; automatic transmission (my wife does not want to drive a car with manual
&gt; shift!). Had all the power stuff (power windows, locks, mirrors, cruise).
&gt; Layout is pretty similar to a Vanagon Camper. A large auxiliary battery is
&gt; under the rear seat (bed) for all the camping gear.
&gt; 
&gt; Things I liked
&gt; --------------
&gt; * Lots of room.
&gt; * Built-in furnace
&gt; * Easy to open pop-up.
&gt; * Pop-up has its own light and openings on the sides also.
&gt; * Much larger propane tank.
&gt; * Engine seemed powerful enough.
&gt; * Handles nicely and was very quiet inside.

Ditto although we did not drive it.  The 5 cyl. audi engine in the
Eurovan we do own has more than adequate power.  I cannot say much
for the gas milage, though.

&gt; 
&gt; Things I did not like
&gt; ----------------------
&gt; * Price sticker (around 31K; 22K for VW and 9K for Winnebago)

I don't think this is unreasonable.  A friend of mine paid more than this
for a Suburban and he can't camp in it. :-)  This is a lot less than
typical motor homes.

&gt; 
&gt; * Gas pedal seemed too close to the center. I assume that is the case for
&gt; all EVs.

The pedals in my Eurovan are OK as far I am concerned.  What
I don't like is the lack of a tilt steering wheel.

&gt; 
&gt; * Roof top luggage rack is smaller than Vanagon's (may be a problem for
&gt; Martha's shower scheme!)
&gt; 
&gt; * Miniblinds on windows instead of curtains.

I prefer miniblinds myself.  The curtains are hard for kids to manage and
can be damaged easily.

&gt; 
&gt; * There is no glass on the left rear (where the closets are). From drivers
&gt; side it makes it look like a cargo van (and ugly IMHO).
&gt; 
&gt; * From the outside the pop-up looks as if it does not belongs there. Again
&gt; this may be my personal taste but I like the much narrower Westfalia one on
&gt; the EuroVan MV with Weekender package.
&gt; 
&gt; * Without the optional middle seat there is room for only two people to sit
&gt; in the back.

So get the middle seat.  The middle seat would be installed when using the
van as a people mover.  I would take it out when camping.

&gt; 
&gt; * The optional middle seat blocks the refrigerator and storage cabinets.

I don't see having the middle seat in when camping as there would be no
room to set up the tables or move around inside the camper.  Since we
are a family of four people, this would not be a problem.

&gt; 
&gt; * Folding tables are stored behind the drivers seat and in front of the
&gt; refrigerator. They were rattling and making too much noise in the van that
&gt; we drove.
&gt; 
&gt; Bottomline:
&gt; -----------
&gt; EV Winnebago is not for us. We'll hold for a EuroVan MV Weekender. There is
&gt; one problem though. The salesman told me that VW may not bring new EV into
&gt; the US market until 1996 model year. I would hate to wait that long (a
&gt; Previa is NOT a replacement for our totalled 85 Westfalia!!!). Can anybody
&gt; else confirm this?

&gt; 

I would consider waiting until 96 as we were told that VW will be coming
out with 6 cyl. versions of the Eurovan.  This should provide even more
power and much better gas milage.  Even though the 5 cyl. engine has more
pep that the 4 cyl., I still feel that the Eurovan is under-powered.

Also, the current Weekender only has a small refrigerator under a seat
and a pop-up.  Are you saying that the '96 Weekenders are going to be
full campers?
