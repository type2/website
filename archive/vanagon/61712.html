Subject: Windshield Washer Pump Gremlins 87GL

Volks,
On my 87 GL the following:
1) Washer pump completely silent when column switch pulled
2) 13.28 volts registering at the 2 pin jack to the washer pump when
column switch activated
3) Washer pump works fabulously when jumpered directly to battery
What gives?
I suspect:
1) insufficient ground: could this cause this
2) insufficient amperage on pos side(I'm not sure this is easily
measured: again, could this cause my symptoms
The Bentley wiring diagram is very hard to decipher, any electron person
with ideas, I welcome your thoughts.
Regards
