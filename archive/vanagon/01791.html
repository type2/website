Subject: what colour is it


Its an 83 diesel with Alpine White upper and a lower ???? Blue.

Its a muted pastel blue.

Somehow through four applications of NUFINISH a year I have prevented it
from rusting and it still has a nice gloss, despite living in upstate
NY the car-cancer capital of the US (where we salt dry roads because there's
an ice storm coming soon anyway ....

:-)
