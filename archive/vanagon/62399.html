Hey Kelly.  The smoke detector is law in Canada... they get installed 
at port of entry (Halifax) before being dealer shipped.  I've given 
up on ours long ago.. you can't cook toast in the van without it 
going off full tilt.  When the battery died.. I never replaced it.  

Take care,
Harry.


&gt; Does anyone else have a smoke detector in their vehicle?  My Westy came
&gt; with a factory installed smoke detector over top of the rear bed.  Makes
&gt; reference to it in the manual as well.  Since Blaine and I have the same
&gt; model year I assume it is because mine is a Canadian market vehicle.
