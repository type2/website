Subject: Re: AVP

&gt; AVP replacement may be as good or better than a local rebuild job,
&gt; and that they provide a limited warranty.  How do you like the
&gt; engine?  The company?  Any problems/comments?

Since I had to reply to a personal email, and someone else just
asked, more opinions as usual.

Warren, most certainly the AVP will be 100% better than a local
rebuild, rebuilding the T4 is not a thing for idiots and as the AVP or
Mark Stephens rebuilt heads are much much better than the only
available new (AMC, Spanish) heads (which have a critical design flaw)
you are certainly better to go with either Stephens or AVP. Now as to
my comments on AVP, Leonard the owner is a bit quirky, he does not
believe in dynamic balancing as necessary in a T4 which is largely
true, but is still a great idea for longetivity.  He learned his trade
from Stephens as head/seat rebuilding goes or so the rumor is told. 
He does an excellent job with wasserboxers that no one else touches. 
He rebuilds the 2.0 air cooled with a bizzarely low compression ration
(7:1 if that) and as a result the engine will likely last forever but
is an utter DOG in a Westy Vanagon.  I also note all my static
compression figures have been only about 110 psi from day one, a bit
low in my book, from the low compression ratio. Still I don't doubt it
will reliably chug on till eternity.  A couple more points, my gas
mileage is horrendous, even by Westy Vanagon standards, about 14-15
mpg since new.  Mileage in these things is largely a function of power
and how much you got to keep it in lower gear to get around, and these
numbers are around the hills of WV, a friend in DC gets about 16-17
mpg so no biggy there, BUT Mark Stephens claims exceptional mileage as
a funtion of the exceptional power of their Stage 1 and 2 bus motors. 
The stock AVP or Stephens is about $1600, the Stage 1 Stephens is
$2200, Stage 2 is $2500 when last I checked.  Personally  I would next
time go with the Stephens Stage 1 if you intend to keep the van, the
mileage will pay for itself many times over during the life of the
van.  The Stage 1 is stock displacement but the heads are worked over,
it is zero decked, race balanced, etc. etc.  A listee, Charles Webb
has recently gone with a Stage 2 and last I heard was pleased with the
engine but not particularly with Stephens service to the tee, he also
thought the Stage 2 was a bit big for the stock injection.  I've
probably been equally annoyed with AVP, talked it up great at first,
but I note when I made a minor comlaint via email about some
&quot;anomalies&quot; later it got me nowhere, still I have had no real
problems, I will be tearing it down myself in a month or so as it's
parts are going into a couple different engines, I had only bought it
in a rush for summer vacation last year, the van it is in will get a
slightly older engine as I'm getting rid of the van.  When I tear it
down, I will post any explanations for the slight problems I've
encountered (low power, need to run heavier oil than I feel
warranted).  All in all I'd rec either company from experience and
heresay, but I'd go for the slighltly warmed over engine in an air
cooled Vanagon Westy, you need it.  As soon as Charles Webb's arm
heals (he broke it I understand) he will likely give us all a better
report on the Stephens engine, until then I'd still look towards them
for the added power.
