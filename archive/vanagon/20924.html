Jim....you and I have been calling Bentley on this one! I'm
just getting a little tired of their responses...besides they
have the arrangement with VWUS to publish the manuals here
in the states...so as they say &quot;$||it flows downhill&quot;. I
figure that VWUS now needs to get into the act.

Its a bit anoying (and yes...I've got a little bitch (no not
my ex-wife) for once on my EV...or actually because of the
lack of manuals) not to have a service manual available..
and to actually have to get one from the UK (which only
covers the 4 cyl gas and 5 cyl diesel versions) which
is published by a non-VW organization and try to use
that and a copy of a VWAG's parts catalogue to figure
out whats wrong with my EV...

I just put in a call to VWUS, and they are supposed to get
back to me later today...so I'll keep you folks posted!
