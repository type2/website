So William Abbott says:
&gt; 
&gt; 	Muffler
&gt; 	Fan Shroud, air vanes, under-cylinder air directors
&gt; 	Generator stand
&gt; 	Flywheel or Presure plate- I'm not sure which, but one of 'em.
&gt; 	Rear body sheetmetal that you take out to remove the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Known-missing when I bought it are
&gt; 	Fuel pump
&gt; 	Thermostat

Bill,

&gt; 
&gt; 	My brother advises using the Pertronic breaker-less ignition,
&gt; and I'm going to go for hydraulic valves. It'll be a '90s kind
&gt; of air-cooled engine! And I'll be on the road!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Bill
&gt; 

I've read in the past that the Compu-fire brand ignition replacement
is superior to the Pertronix (Perlux?) ignition which tends to wear out in a
relatively short time.   And damned if I don't have the details of the
company for this device but I'm sure it's Archived somewhere.
