California requires every car to have a smog check every 2 years at the time
of registration renewal. Well, since CA DMV has just screwed up in their
computer upgrade (and so is the database) by choosing computers from Tandem
they actually allow you to register every other year without smog. If a car
can not pass smog it still can register every other year.

They spent something like $50 million big time and declared total failure
on the project. I believe they gave up the project and are trying to do it
all over with IBM mainframes. I can not imagine if Mr. Wilson is elected
to be president what is going to happen from my pocket.
