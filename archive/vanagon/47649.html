Harvey is correct on just about everything, but one (he is almost correct 
on that one, too).

Yes, for ideal diodes.


&gt;(volts [characteristic of the LED] and ma. draw to stay within the design

&gt;desired.  Otherwise, if my memory is correct - if you provided the diode with
&gt;an unlimited current source at 2.5 +  volts, it would draw unlimited current
&gt;and burn itself out unless some kind of current limit was imposed.  That's
&gt;primarily  what the series resistor is for-current limiting, and secondarily,
&gt;to drop the excess source voltage from our car battery/alternator.   Memory
&gt;says that an LED is a reverse biased diode, and when you apply a voltage in
&gt;excess of the breakdown voltage, it begins to conduct (and thus radiate) but

No.  an LED is a forward-biased diode.  You're thinking of the Zener Diodes.
(The world of science/engineering lost Mr. Zener a few years back -- his
discovery
has made a great many things possible, among which is the solid-state
voltage regulator).  Hence the rest of this discussion needs to be modified.
I'll work on it some....

&gt;without current limit up to the limitations of the p/n junction to handle the
&gt;current and associated power dissipation.  Individual designs for LEDs have
&gt;different breakdown voltage (2.2 v. min is typical as I recall) and design
&gt;power dissipation that is related to brightness.  The power dissipation is
&gt;basically the current through the LED times the voltage across it. Check the
&gt;data sheet for the device in quesiton. In fact now that I think about it more
&gt;- the LED will hold a constant voltage drop across itself independent of
&gt;applied voltage applied higher than the breakdown voltage.  Of course, the

This is quite true.  It goes for forward-biased diodes, as well as Zener
diodes (even LEDs, which are not-so-ideal forward diodes).  Forward biased
diodes just display this property under normal operation.  Silicon-based
ones characteristically display .7 Volts of drop, Gallium based ones
display .2 Volts, and whatever LEDs are made of, they get about 2.6V
drop.



&gt;higher the applied voltage beyound the drop across the diode, the higher the
&gt;current drawn, the brighter the device until it exceeds power dissipation and
&gt;burns out!
