You might try the Ukraine or Beylarusa (sp.); the deuterium on the black
market is hard to find, but very reasonably priced.  

I switched over the water-burning engine that the big three have been
sitting on since the '60's;  probably a mistake since Va. Beach has been
rationing the water for 5 years.

&gt; 
&gt; Talk about gas prices, anyone checked the cost of deuterium lately.
&gt; My van has Type VII cold fusion deuterium injectors installed by the
&gt; PO who worked at a government lab. Although I get 100,000 miles/mole
&gt; the damn little canister is down to a 1/2 already, and the van only has 
&gt; 55,000 miles on it.  I figure its gonna
&gt; cost about $6,500 to refill. At these prices, I might just rip the whole
thing 
&gt; out, and go back to gas, but it burns my ass to pay gas tax. I assume
that 
&gt; some day they'll find out how many people are burning heavy water, 
&gt; and put road taxes on it too. Happened to diesel oil, and propane. Its
only
&gt; a matter of time before the taxes cause people to start smuggling it out
of 
&gt; power plants to avoid the taxes.
&gt;
