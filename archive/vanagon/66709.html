Subject:      Re: Binding when turning

thanks for all the replys

the binding is not normal...it is different than the normal binding on a
tight turn....it kicks in sooner and seems tighter ... and first
appeared after driving at highway speeds for long distance when it was
hot out

i think Jim Davis offers me the best hope because he seems to know what
i am talking about and his cure makes sense....i'm going to replcae the
tires and change the differential fluid to slippery synthetic....and
i'll report back in about a month....

thanks again
