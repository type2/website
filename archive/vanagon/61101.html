My temp gauge runs just on the lower inner edge of the low coolant warning
light.  It has gone higher but has never gone over the &quot;ooops&quot; mark.  I did
have a spill over once but I thing after researching the problem that it
was too much coolant in the fill tank.  I will be interested to see what
your responses are.
