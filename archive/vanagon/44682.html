Subject: Re: 86 Westy Syncro oil pressure woes


&gt; After trying everything from using the OEM filter to replacing the sending
&gt; units I bit the bullet and installed a VDO oil press. gauge. Low and behold
&gt;I
&gt; have an actual oil press. problem. After  the van reaches operating temp.
&gt;the
&gt; gauge reads about 6-9 psi at idle and about 22 psi at highway speeds. This
&gt;is
&gt; after a so called reliable dealer assured me that the pressure checked out
&gt;at
&gt; 32psi..

Where did you install the VDO sender?  I believe the placement of the
sender can alter the reading by the gauge.  The pressure as the oil leaves
the pump will be higher than the pressure after it's  finished it's
lubrication route.  Soooo, this maybe influencing your readings.  I'm
curious to hear the answer to this so keep me posted.
