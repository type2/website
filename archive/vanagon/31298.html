Well this is what I managed to get.

Each of these are separate manuals.

    (W42 070 193 110)
2.  From 1993 Body-Exterior Body-Interior (W42 070 193 107 A)
3.  From 1993 Heating &amp; Air Conditioning (W42 070 193 108)
4.  CV Camper and MultiVan From 1993 General Body Repairs (W42 070 193 111)
5.  From 1995 General, Engine, On Board Diagnostic, Fuel and Ignition
    (W42 070 193 112)
6.  From 1993 Electrical Equipment (W42 070 193 109)

NOTE: These things are very detailed, much more so than the Bentley I had 
      for the Vanagon.

If you need any specific info, let me know and I'll look it up for you.
