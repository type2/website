&gt; I rechecked the gauge's accuracy and found that, this time, it is dead
&gt; on. Boiled a full kettle of water on the Westy stove and dipped the
&gt; dipstick sensor in it: gauge showed about 210-215F. Of course, this
&gt; does not yet prove that it will also correctly measure higher
&gt; temperatures, but the 285F reading this past weekend becomes even more
&gt; disconcerting. I now come to suspect that the oil cooler is not
&gt; working at all and my plan is to check the oil pressure relief valve. 
&gt; As you know, its function is to let oil bypass the cooler when it is
&gt; cold and thick and my guess is that it is stuck. I really hope that's
&gt; the problem, since this would be a relatively easy fix. Could 285
&gt; degrees have harmed the oil (Mobil 1) so that it should replaced?

According to info at:

http://wj_dot_net/f-body/trivia/syn_oil.html,

synthetic oils should be good for well beyond that up (to 500-700F)

and Mobil claims up to 470 F for Mobil 1.
