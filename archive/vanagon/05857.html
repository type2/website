&gt; Hi Folks. Has anybody used these spark plugs in the Vanagons?  My '90
&gt; Syncro Westfalia just chews through the stock Bosch Supers (w7cc0).  VW
&gt; says 48000 Km or 2 years for spark plug intervals, and after 32000 Km
&gt; and a little over a year the plug gap is over 40 thou!  I bought a set
&gt; of the Bosch Platinums (wr7cp) and haven't put them in yet.  They are
&gt; supposed to be the ultimate plugs, and they will wear 2 - 3 times longer..
&gt; .so I have been told.

    Geez, you have to do tune-ups more often than that, eh? Replacing the 
plugs is one thing, and cleaning/regapping another. Is this electronic
ignition? Electronic ignition usually runs spark gaps of at least 40
normally, often 60. Don't know much about waterboxers, but the aircooled
definitely benefits from complete tuneups (timing, plugs, and valve lash) 
at least checked and adjusted, if need be, every 2500 miles, and a must 
at 5000 miles.
