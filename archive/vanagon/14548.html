    JABBERWAGEN
    by Screwloose Feral


Twas brilliant, and the propane stoves
    Did fyre and syzzle in the van;
All sparkle were the splits and loaves
    And the idle thoughts outran.

&quot;Beware the Jabberwagen bus!
   &quot;The rattles that ne'er cease their speech!
&quot;Beware the Bus-Bus chorus line,
   &quot;And listen not to what they preach!&quot;

He lifted up his greasley tools;
   Long time the irksome rattle sought ...
Til slumbered he by the Half-Fast Tree
   And rested eyes in thought.

And as pretended he to sleep,
   The Jabberwagen squeaked again,
Still certain of abilities
   To do its wants and when.

One, Two! Three, Four! And ratchet more!
   The hex-side socket felt his heft!
And with the rattle dead and gone,
   He gathered up his tools and left.

&quot;And hast thou silenced now the bus?&quot;
   They said as closer came he still;
&quot;Oh, Happy Day! Hot Damn! Hooray!&quot;
   And then he handed them the bill.

Twas brilliant, and the propane stoves
    Did fyre and syzzle in the van;
All sparkle were the splits and loaves
    And the idle thoughts outran.
