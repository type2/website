Subject: Vanagon Engine Alternatives

For some time, I have been looking for alternatives to the wasserboxer engine
in my '85 Westie.  I have has an '87 Vanagon GL and have gone through the
leaky head gasket thing three times with it.  When the '85 sprung a leak this
fall, I said enough is enough.  I have seen lots of discussion about
Golf/Jetta engine replacements, but  it seems that they have all been done to
diesel Vanagons.  I haven't been able to find anyone who has done the
conversion to a wasserboxer.

I called Kennedy Engineered Products last Friday.  They are famous for their
adapter plates for adapting almost any engine to any vehicle.  They have
adapter plates for adapting Golf/Jetta engines, but numerous parts from a
diesel Vanagon are needed to complete the conversion.  They do have a
conversion kit that they are developing which adapts a Subaru engine (135h
opposed 4 cylinder from a Legacy) to the Vanagon.  They are part way through
the process of getting the conversion approved for California emissions
tests.  At the present time, they are not pursuing the development of a kit
for Golf/Jetta conversions.

My preference is to keep the vehicle German if possible.  While the Subaru
engine is a perfect fit and all, I have had good experience with engine
reliability through several hundred thousand miles of Rabbit/Golf/Jetta
driving.  I want to use the Westie this summer, so need to get moving on
something.

Does any list member have experience with the Subaru engine conversion?

Are there list members who have replaced their wasserboxer engines with a
Golf/Jetta engine? 

Does anyone know where I can find an '82 diesel Vanagon parts donor vehicle
in the Midwest (I am in Illinois)?  Engine condition is not important, but it
should still be with the vehicle. 

Your thoughts, experience, and leads are appreciated.
