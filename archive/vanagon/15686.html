After seeing that damnable RED LIGHT come on and stay on over a week ago, I
knew either the generator or the volt. reg. was kapoot, and since I'd just
put in a new battery and couldn't afford a shop diagnosis, I drove her just
the same; all the while thinking: Muir once drove 1,000miles like
this.......Well, I drove about 80 before yesterday when she decided to stay
put.
I followed Muir's procedure for testing the generator by removing both wires
from the gen., clipping the heavy one to my timing light and grounding out
the second to the gen. with the light, and got nothing; no light, even at a
scream of an rpm. Hence, the generator must come out. There is only about 3
inches of space between the top of the compartment and the fan shrouding to
lift it and wiggle the gen. out. Would it just be easier to drop the whole
engine and go from there?? This is something that has to be done as soon as
possible, as Ramona is my sole source of transportation, and I can't keep
getting jumps from my roommate and co-workers just to get to and from....Any
advice would be helpful!! The bummer is that I'd wanted to wait to drop the
engine until I was able to rebld. and install an engine from a Super Beetle
(courtesy of our friend, Ric!!!), but a gals gotta do what a gal's gotta do
to get her baby hummin' again, so help me out here - I've never dropped an
engine before so I need some good, seasoned advice!!!!
Thanks, all*      Rachel &amp; Ramona too!
