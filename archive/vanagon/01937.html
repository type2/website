Subject: Maintaining the Vanagon: Hidden stuff

Does anyone have a list of things that should be maintained on their
bus/vanagon that isn't in the owner's manual?  I'm thinking of things 
like cv joints (repack every 30K?).  But what really got me thinking
about this was the little &quot;dust-catcher&quot; that sits under the air-intake
box that directs fresh air to the air cleaner.  Are there other little
things that need to be cleaned out periodically?
