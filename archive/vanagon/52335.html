Subject: Re: vanagon exhaust systems

Are we talking air-cooled or water-cooled here?  Are we talking Federal
only, or also California models?

I'd sure be interested in air-cooled, California model stuff.  From what
I've been seeing in the junkyards and in talking to folk, the particular
problems for this group, (me too) are: a)left side exhaust manifold
(cracking is a chronic problem) and b)left side heat exchanger (poor
design results in wear where exchanger meets muffler.)

Locally, someone has developed a left side exhaust manifold (steel, but
I don't think stainless) which seems to sell for $250, which I thought was
pretty steep given the small amount of material involved, and the straight-
forward construction.  I've also seen posts about the need for crossover
pipes.

I have a feeling someone can make a buck making after-market exhaust bits
for Vanagons.

&gt; Gerry,
&gt; Hi, I work with the Stebro Exhausts company and we noticed a little while ago that 
&gt; there do'nt seem to be any good quality and reasonably priced replacement Vanagon 
&gt; mufflers and pipes. We are thinking about tooling up to produce Vanagon systems 
&gt; (manifold pipes &amp; mufflers) in stainless steel. If - there is demand and it makes 
&gt; economic sense for us. 
&gt; 
&gt; What we would like to know from owner/enthusiasts is: how many of you would be 
&gt; interested and what do each of you feel is a reasonable price to pay? If we get enuf 
&gt; enquiries (have had only 4-5 so far) and can make a system for what people feel is a 
&gt; reasonable price - then we will do it.
&gt; 
&gt; Studies in the U.K. have shown that exhaust systems of stainless steel last so much 
&gt; longer than mild or aluminized steel that, in spite of high material costs, after 5 
&gt; years of service, they have ended up costing less than half that of mild steel exhaust 
&gt; systems. Not to mention the lower stress on the environment from continually replacing 
&gt; ordinary steel exhausts.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope that we can do something for you guys and TIA.
