Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Your food list looks so good, but can't make it in time from NC.... :)
Ya'll have a GREAT time!
BTW, by the looks of the food list, all should keep their backsides 
pointed AWAY from the fire...don't want to hear about spontanious 
combustion of any listers because they farted too close to the fire.
