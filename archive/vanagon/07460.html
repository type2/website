Subject: GATT and the VW Bus

Does anyone out there know the details of the GATT bill and if it will
reduce or eliminate the tariff on imported trucks?

I remember way back in the '70's that the US slapped a 25% tariff on trucks
to retaliate for some country (Germany?) putting a tariff on our chickens,
and that's why we don't get no steenkin' non-passenger versions of VW
buses anymore.

If GATT passes, might we get cheaper prices on the truck part of the
Winnebago camper????   Might we get stranger versions of the Eurovan?
 
Might VWoA pass on the savings to the purchaser???      (yeah, right.)

Any foreign trade experts or congresspersons or senators in this group?
