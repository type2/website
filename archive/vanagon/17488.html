Subject: Q on 84 miss print in paper
Date: Sat, 13 May 1995 11:50:48 -0400 (EDT)

Well thanks to everyone with info on the 84 I wrote about.  I called the guy to
find out that it was indeed a miss print in the paper.  He is asking 3100.  He 
wasn't to happy when I told him that the paper said 1200.  I bet he gets 
several calls the next couple of days with people inquiring (SP) about the 
price.
Thanks again
Brad
