Subject: Bosch books


	Someone mentioned something about Bosch books 
(stop me if I'm being too specific)
	Anyway, SAE is always advertising a Bosch Automotive
handbook, and a Bosch Fuel Injection book.
	Has anyone seen either of these? I've been tempted to
buy them, but would like to hear from someone that has them,or
has seen them as to their general usefullness.
(it also just occurs to me that I should check the libraries around
here, eh?)

thanks
Matt
