Subject: Joel, Stat change please! and Questions

 Hello Joel and all,
   Please update my stats to include a 1991 Vanagon Carat,  it's not named
yet, although Polar Bear was suggested by my 7 year old daughter,, We''ve had
Polar temp.s here in KC this week, the first morning I drove her to work it
was a wind chill of  -40 !!  I have a few Vanagon questions,,
 
  1)  The end cap on the rear bumper is broken, where can a replacement be
found?
        Should I try salvage yards or a dealership??

  2)   While cruising at 70 mph, the tach is right at the ragged edge of the
&quot;green&quot;              area,, is this a problem,, can extended driving be done
in the uncolored area   between the green and red zones??

         Thanks,
           Pink Newell
