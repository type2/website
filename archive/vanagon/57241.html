Subject: Re: Finally - A Web Page Is Born

To Doug &amp; Malcolm -

Did check it out and everything looks fine.  C-Zone has been upgrading their
 phone line and modem capacity for the past month and a half, so there has
been brief (but very brief) burps in the system.  They did have a 160
incoming line capacity and they're adding much more this month.  I spoke to
Joe (Website Admin) down there and he says my site is getting an enormous
amount &quot;hits&quot; for such a new page.  He also recommends that lower case
letters be used when typing out the URL.  Guess it must be doing something
good - our telephone traffic this week has a big surge, most of it related to
the site.

I was into the page at about the time Doug Skinner tried to connect and I was
doing some minor fixes to grammar, mistakes, etc., and that may have had a
bearing on that.  Hope to have some new info loaded on Sunday evening (very,
very late) for Monday's viewing.

Malcolm - The IRS I photo is an old one.  We're working on doing some newer,
crisper photos for both the ads and the page.  IRS II photo is a little
better, but could be improved too.

Thanks for your posts regarding difficulties in connecting.

Jim
