Subject: Felix Wong's Thanksgiving and DPOs

Felix - I loved your thanksgiving day story!  What a testimonial to LBCs.
 But you missed your big chance to be a hero and DPO at the same time: When I
was in college I knew a guy who owned a Bug with a bad fuel pump.  He didn't
have the money (or interest) to buy a new fuel pump, so he came up with a
better idea - he installed a non-vented gas cap and installed a valve stem in
it so that he could pressureize the gas tank (do NOT try this at home!)
thereby pushing gas into the carburettors.  When the car started to stumble,
he would pull into a gas station (or use his bicycle pump) and put more
compressed air into the tank.  Of course the fact that gas tanks are not
designed to be used as a pressure vessel never seemed to cross the guys mine.
 Guess he never heard of work-hardening.  However, he drove the car that way
for 6 months before graduation and didn't blow himself up.  Lucky or Stupid?
 You decide!
