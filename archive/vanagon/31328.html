Subject: TIRE QUESTIONS?

I'm kind of new to this bus/van thing (only owned an EV for 8 months),  I
hear a lot on the list about tire ply.  Two questions:

1.  Is the high ply tires needed for vans because:

a.) The weight of the van 
b.) Because the handling is so odd and the added ply is required for stifness
and intern      better handling.
c.) None of the above.

2.  If the answer to the first question is b.) does this also apply to EV's?
( I know the tires that I have on the van now are Conti's Cotran's 6 ply
tread/ 2 ply. side wall.)

I haven't had to put tires on the van yet, but I thought I would ask the
question before I needed to.


Thanks for your help,
(Happy Holidays)
