Subject: Re: CV joint boots

&gt; Malcolm I think the outside cv boots with disc brake applications need to
&gt; withstand a lot of heat.Some Ford products use different material on the
&gt; outside boots also. My mail server  has been down for a couple of days so I
&gt; don't know all that is going on with type2.   Darrell  
&gt; 
This could be, although I've replaced many boots on Hondas and Golfs and
Jettas that have front drive and disc brakes, and on Peugeots with rear
drive, but also disc brakes, all with what appeared to be the same black 
rubber.  Of course all black rubbery material is not rubber.  The Syncro
outer boots on mine are really different, but the ones on the bus originally
were just like the replacements -- white plastic.  I've seen other syncros
with rubber outer boots (and failed ones).

So how about you other Syncro owners?  I have rather stiff white plastic
(well, rather dirty brownish now) outer CV boots that came on my 86 Kombi,
and two shiny new Lobro ones that are identical for eventual replacements.
I, however, was looking at another Syncro for ale, which had black rubber
outer CV boots -- one failed -- which the owner said were originals.  What's
the scoop?  Anybody else have the stiff white plastic jobs?  Any failures?
My inner boots failed, but the outers seem fine still.  Anybody have the
rubber outer boots on their syncros, and which are originals?
