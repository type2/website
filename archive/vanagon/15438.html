Subject: Re: '66 bus mirrors

&gt;genuine VW elephant ears have VWOA stamped on the back of 
&gt;them. Anybody

&gt;know better than I?

Michael:

You mean the 65 Dodge Dart look-alike mirrors on my 67
probably _ARE_ 65 Dodge Dart mirrors &amp; not some exotic
version of the E.Ears?

BTW: Bus Stop Catalog (p20) sells some pretty nice repros
of these magnificent mirrors. Mine have the grey rubber trim
even &amp; actually fit pretty nice in the door hinges of the Single
Cab.... Much clearer &amp; BRIGHTER than the deflaked originals.
