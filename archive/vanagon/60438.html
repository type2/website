&lt;&lt;  If only
 it had a headrest and reclined back further. Oh well...
  &gt;&gt;


you CAN put a headrest on it.  Not many people know this, but ALL Vanagon
seats (front, middle rear, westy or 7 or 9 pass, even the jumpseats on a wolf
ed and Carat....yes, THEY ALL have the provisions for headrests. Feel with
your thumb on the top of the seatback where the headrest bars would enter the
seat. Push down hard with your thumb. 
Feel the 2 holes in the metal?
All you need to do is carefully puncture the upholstry in the spot right over
each hole,  and get yourself some other headrests and preferably the little
socket they fit into, and pop them right in!

neat, huh?

great...now there's gonna a proliferation of junked vanagons missing their
headrests....  :&lt;)
