&gt; &gt; and speaking of this 'horn', what does it sound like? it's not the same gizmo
&gt; &gt; that makes the seat belt 'La Cucaracha' music, is it? cause i kinda like
&gt; &gt; dis-emboweled mine. :)  well, i'm SORRY, but i just couldn't take it any more
&gt; &gt; one day, and i disconnected that little speaker in the relay!

&gt; &gt; joel
&gt; &gt; oh he of Silent Running.
&gt; Gee, and I replaced the stock buzzer from my 82 vanagon with a late model
&gt; jetta musical gizmo. Its not &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;, more of a waltz I think.
&gt; Anyway it is annoying, but much much much better than the obnoxious buzzer.

&gt; he who needs auditory reminders

Naaah!  It's 'La Cucaracha' as Joel said.  Drives ya nuts!  I still haven't
disconnected mine yet.  Don't know why.  I'm sure it's easy.
