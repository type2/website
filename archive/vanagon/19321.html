Hello everyone,
	Shelley and I have returned triumphant from GNATT, after
traveling over 7,500 miles!  No major mechanical problems.  We
encountered more than our share of rain, and even some pretty major
flooding!  We also met several list members for the first time.  I
will begin to compose a trip report as soon as my life has returned
to some degree of normalcy.  Overall, it was a great success and a lot
of fun!

	Unfortunately, in my absence word came down that there were to
be no personal web pages here where I work, so my VW page (and my
homepage and Ford photo gallery) had to be taken offline.  I am tring
to find an internet service provider that will let me have a web page
without asking for my firstborn, and I hope to have it all back online
before too long.  In the interim, if anyone needs access to anything on
the pages, e-mail me privately and I can arrange it.

Yes, it's great to be home (and back on the Vanagon list!).  :)

-David
