&gt;&gt; &gt;It did say it had an oil leak from the head gaskets.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Uh, Bug engines (incl upright bus engines like yours) don't have head
&gt;&gt; gaskets; and if they did, there wouldn't be any oil on either side of them
&gt;&gt; anyway. Watercooled engines occasionally have problems with cracked
&gt;&gt; (&quot;blown&quot;) head gaskets, which let water drain into their oil, but that's
&gt;&gt; a different subject.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Upright engines often do leak oil from their pushrod tubes and/or valve
&gt;&gt; covers. Other points are the crankcase seam and the place where the oil
&gt;&gt; cooler mounts inside the fan shroud; and the classic place where the
&gt;&gt; crankshaft comes out of the engine to the flywheel.
&gt;
&gt;I think the person may have meant that oil was leaking from the base of
&gt;the cylinders, where they go into the case.  There is usually a spacer
&gt;there and the joint will supposedly leak if you don't smear sealant all
&gt;over it when you install the liners.  I always use sealant on that
&gt;joint, and I don't think I have ever had an oil leak there, but I've
&gt;seen engines that did.

Sorry, that is exactly what I meant.  I was not thinking clearly.  Goes to
show you how ingrained certain terminology is even to VW owners.

&gt;
&gt;As for whether to buy the bus or not, just ask yourself if this is
&gt;really the type of bus you want (year, style, options) or are you just
&gt;looking at it cause it's cheap.  In my experience, buying a vehicle that
&gt;is not just what you want is futile, cause no matter how much you fix it
&gt;up, you will always be wishing, &quot;I wish I had bought a splittie
&gt;instead&quot;, or whatever.  You can repair rust, fix mechanicals, and
&gt;repaint, but you can't change the basic bus, so start with the one you
&gt;really want, even if it costs more or needs a lot of work.
&gt;

Oh, it is being bought because it is cheap but only as a parts bus to the
Westy.  the Westy needs an engine (and a battery and a spare tire metal,
and floor rubber and and and and....  A lot of which this particular bus
can provide.
