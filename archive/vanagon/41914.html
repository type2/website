Subject: Need Headlight enclosure for '91 Vanagon

Okay folks,

I've got to get pro-active and start looking for another enclosure
for the Drivers side headlight.  The glass was broken actually, on the
way to the first Pfeiffer camp out.  I just have been to busy (or too lazy)
to look seriously into getting a replacement.  So now, I well be actively
looking for one.  If anyone out there as a spare, please let me know.  Just
in case some of you don't realize it, the newer ones are square.

Thanks for any leads....
