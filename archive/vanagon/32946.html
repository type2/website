Subject: Re: Eurovan heater info?

Dan,

The manual dosen't list a specific heater. (Make/Model)

It list front and rear heaters, all differing depending on the Model of EV.
It also list a &quot;Auxiliary heater BL2 (Canada Only)&quot; that is a gas heater.

Altogether there are about 20 pages of schematics.  If you send me your 
snail mail address I'll send you copies.
