Subject: Purging Cooling System

Once again, I purged some air from the cooling system on my 85 vanagon.  
And, after I thought I had it all out, once again the heater is running 
cold (I had it running warm air).  So, I assume I have more air to bleed 
out.  

Anyone want to offer any moral support on this?  How long must I live 
with my VW's nose 1/2 meter in the air?

I let the old heifer run for a good half hour.
