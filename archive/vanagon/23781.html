&gt;   The road down to Shelter Cove was winding and steep.  Some of the switchbacks

&gt; couple grizzly looking seals sunning themselves on the rocks.  This area is
&gt; really out of the way and I could see why the northern coastline is nicknamed
&gt; &quot;The Lost Coast&quot;.

I went down in David's bus as a pasenger, along with his wife, 3 kids, 
and Al.  Adn so David had to use 1st on a couple hills, and stop once on 
the way down to let the brakes cool.  

&gt; 'till about 3:30am.  I could swear I saw Scott Harvey's vanagon with a
&gt; bike rack along the 101 just south of Garberville.  Whoever it was waved back
&gt; to me.  There was alot of delays along the 101 for repaving and a detour

I think that was Jeff and me in Martha's bus (looks like Scott's).  And 
we also noticed a bus that looked like Jack's bus, and the guy waved at 
us too.  :)  I was driving.
