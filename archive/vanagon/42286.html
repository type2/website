Subject: Re: High Top Vanagon???

&gt;&gt;a vehicle (other than the heads leak)??? I've seen buses that
&gt;&gt;have high tops but never a vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;I have seen a couple of these, but not many.  I think they are made by
&gt;Adventurewagen.  I particularly like them because their fiberglass tops
&gt;have windows in the rear (mine doesn't).

Digging through my fiche for 86+ Syncros I found a high top illustration, 
some body parts were available.  It seemed to have two lights up front-top, 
a window or sunroof above cab and a circular ventilator at middle that they 
listed all the parts for.  Looked like ambulance vehicle, offroad?   Tim Smith
