Subject: oil pressure vs. oil temp gauge?

hey now,

in the process of rebuilding rumba's powerplant, need to decide on some gauges.
i'm going for the head temp, tachometer, and either an oil pressure or oil temp
gauge. question is...hmm, which one? wouldn't an oil pressure gauge be better?
if the pressure is going down, then wouldn't that mean the temp is going up?
but if the oil temp goes up, this doesn't necessarily mean the pressure is
going down. do i have this right? so a pressure guage would be better?
hehehe does anyone understand what i just typed? i'm not sure i do...:-)
