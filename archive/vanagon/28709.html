&gt;There are two very top rate supply houses that I have used for all of my
&gt;electronic needs (non-automotive)...
&gt;
&gt;1. Mouser Electronics, 800 346 6873
&gt;2. Digi Key, 800 ____ _____ (don't have number, threw out last cat, call
&gt;                             directory)
&gt;
&gt;Catalogs are free. Get both before you shop as both places have slightly
&gt;different prices for the same stuff.  Digi Key has more IC parts.

Digi-Key is at (800)344-4539.  That's (800)DIGI-KEY.

No affiliation, jus' had their catalog nearby.
