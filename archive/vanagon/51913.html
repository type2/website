Hi Danno,

In Edmonton Alberta Canada they are a *MUST*.  I have the flat square block 
heater on my 1987 Syncro Westie and it helps tremendously with starting.  If it 
is parked outside, after -35 Celcius the van won't start without it.  In warmer 
temps (-15C -&gt; -25C) it helps starting but isn't necessary for it to crank 
over.  The starter definately doesn't have to work as hard if it has been 
plugged in though. IMHO, it is worth the $$ for the block heater.

Cheers
Tony
