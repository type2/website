&gt; 
&gt; One trick to overcoming the mean head and side winds is to find a Big
&gt; 18 wheeler going the speed you want to go and tailgate him.

In my more youthful days, I got a ticket for &quot;following too closely&quot;
for doing this particular action.

I hear that the &quot;following too closely&quot; ticket is pretty hard to get.
I was driving a '71 at the time, and told the cop the truth, that I 
was trying to save some gas.  This happened in I-5 south of Mt. Vernon,
Washington, in 1982 (?).  Don't know if the cops are still so anal.
