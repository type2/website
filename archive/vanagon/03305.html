Subject: tires, once again
Date: Wed, 24 Aug 1994 22:35:51 -0500 (CDT)

I'm sorry, I know we just had a thread on bus tires and I hate to bring
this up again, so if someone could refer me to some archive with the
pertinent info, I would be very appreciative. 

Now, this is the info I got from a local tire shop: the best for the bus
would be a 185/SR14 Michelin XZX Reinforced ($85) and the second best
would be a 205/70R14 Michelin MXL Reinforced ($105) which has the
disadvantage that it is not an all-season. They should be reinforced
because of sway. (Reinforced Continentals would be the 3rd solution, but
they don't carry them). 

Would you all second that opinion? If you prefer not to bother the other
190 people who paid better attention than I, then send me a direct reply
at dakhlia_at_wuecona.wustl_dot_edu. 

Thanks,

Sami, 75 Westfalia
