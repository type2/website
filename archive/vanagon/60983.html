Wondering if there's any takers on a complete A/C system from the 87'
Syncro I'm parting out. Another listmember agreed with me that it wouldn't
be that difficult as the mounting brackets are already there. When I remove
the components I'll be sure to label eveything and include some photos. 

Alot of the small stuff is going quick but there's still alot available.
Stop by my page to take a look at the progress. Even if you don't need
parts go to my page anyway and give me some feedback on what you'll like to
see there.

If anyone can tell me why the frames version of my page won't work with
Netscape, please do. I can't figure that sucker out!

*** Next time you get pulled over by the police say, &quot;Officer, have you
ever seen an stupid idiot wrapped in plastic?&quot; Then hand him your license.
Who knows, he might have a sense-of-humor and let you go :-) ****
