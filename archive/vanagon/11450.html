&gt;Could someone be kind a enough to make a check the next time out at
&gt;night to see if this switch lights up for me?  Appreciate any
&gt;feedback.

in my 88 bus, the parking/headlight switch does NOT repeat NOT light up
in any way. it's a Braille-switch. :)  which is a bit odd, but i guess i'd
gotten so used to it i didn't notice anymore. it's easy to find with your
fingers and thumb, though, as it is located there by the edge of the little
instrument 'pod'.
