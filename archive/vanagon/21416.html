Subject: Early ('57-58?) Single Cab Parts

Sorry to post this to the whole list...

I had a dialogue with someone who needed a side door for a single
cab.

I found one, it locks, has a lock, is in good shape, but its gonna be
like pullin' freakin teeth to get him to sell...

He has a' 57 or '57 single cab with a good bed, relatively straight body,
a little bit of rust here and there, slowly missing more and more pieces
good gates, no motor or trans...  This baby is salvageable,m IMHO, if
you want it bad enuf.  

He really wants to sell the whole thing (can't say I blame him) as
a unit.

So, whoever it was that wanted this stuff, you know where to get me...
He might be presuaded ($$) to part with some of it...

Its in the Sacramento, CA, area, BTW
