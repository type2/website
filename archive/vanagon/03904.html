&gt;1.  My 82 diesel Westfalia camper, which I've had for about 6-months,
&gt;seems to pump out an inordinate amount of heat from the dashboard heater
&gt;area even when the heater is off. Is this just something I have to live
&gt;with or am I doing something wrong as far as heater lever settings or is
&gt;something haywire mechanically. The BEDBUG seems to run great otherwise.

do you mean it just 'feels' hot down by the center of the dash? or is it
actually 'putting out' heat from the vents? if it just 'feels' hot,
get the bentley book (yes, i know it's expensive, but there are some cheaper
places around). on page 19.20-19.22, it describes exactly this situation and
the 'Hot Footwell kit' from the dealer (which replaces some cardboard air
deflectors and adds some insulating mats in certain areas up front to keep
the heat out of the driver/passenger area.

&gt;2.  I live in the Pacific Northwest (Olympia, WA, to be exact). Is there
&gt;a dealer up here that sells awnings designed for vw campers or similar?

anybody ever find anything worthwhile for buses and vanagons? Poor Richard :)
found his for the eurovan, but i don't remember anyone with a bus or vanagon
saying they found one.
