Subject: ANNOUNCE: Donwloadable Sermons Files


Thanks to the tenacity of several dedicated listees who have been working
hard in background, Bob Hoover's Sermons can now be downloaded as a single
archive, in order to make it easier to print them out and take them outside
and get them all greasy.

The following URLs may change. If they do, they'll be linked from the
Sermons archive:  http://www.type2_dot_com/sermons/  but until I manage to
filch FTP space from somebody they can be had here:

ftp://ftp.type2_dot_com/sermons/sermons.ascii
plain text uncompressed, 641K

ftp://ftp.type2_dot_com/sermons/sermons.txt.sea
self-extracting Macintosh, 255K

ftp://ftp.type2_dot_com/sermons/sermons.exe
self-extracting PC, 276K

ftp://ftp.type2_dot_com/sermons/sermons.zip
compressed PC/UNIX, 252K

I want to praise the following people to the skies--without them these
files would not exist:

--Jeff Linkinhoker organized the Sermons intelligently by category. This
was a task that made everybody else blanche and back toward the door.

--Bill Keating, Craig Koon and Jack Maynard downloaded and formatted the
things, which took a great deal of time and thought and effort. These guys
are as good as they get.

--Bob Hoover. Anybody who isn't in Bob's debt, raise your hand? I didn't
think so. ;)

Somebody please forward this to vintagevw. Once I secure FTP space I'll
post it to the newsgroup--being over the disk quota is enough without being
over the transmission quota as well. I got the mail from all the people who
offered space, thank you! and I'm working down the list.
