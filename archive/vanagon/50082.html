Subject:       Lurker Out Of Hiding-Re:'87Head Gasket...


    Good Day to all Knowns and Unknowns alike:
    
    Out from the East End of L.I. NY come words from a relatively
    &quot;green&quot; digest subscriber.  In my few months of message scanning
    it has become apparent that there are many &quot;knowledgables&quot; out 
    there who seem to have a wealth of info to offer (tech and other).
    Education is a dangerous thing ... lurking is not w/out merit
    Even better, they obviously have or make the time to relay it
    out onto this ever expanding means of mass communication.
    
    Well, I've been doing that little wave or flash of the lights
    thing tween VWs for going on about 12yrs now.
    First was '84 no frills then upgraded to '87 Westy Wolf Weekender
    150K later and lovin it - we call her &quot;BAWANADO&quot;.  Heads done as 
    part of VWoA campaign early on, CVs _at_75K, fuel &amp; water pumps, 
    usual reduction in cooling system heat xfr coefficient, etc, etc.
    (Daughter came w/ first and son came w/ second Wasserboxers)
    
    Well it sure feels good to be out of the closet!       
                     
                     Other '87s: Subaru GL Wagon(130k) - Le'Urabus
          REPTOMAN               XJ6 (75K) - Hi Maint Gal!
                                 Toy P/U (68K) - 'lil men in big 
                                                trucks &amp; the woman
                                                who luv 'em ...
