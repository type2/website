Subject: Wheel Covers

While on vacation in California, I meet the owner of a 89 Westfalia with some
non standard wheel covers.  These were the chrome dish type covers with the
VW symbol on them.  I think this type was used on older buses.  Anyway these
looked Great on his late model Westy !  He said, and I agreed, that the
standard plastic wheel covers are OK but these look much better.  He also
said that these fit on the stock rims, no problemo.  In all of the excitement
I forgot to ask him where he got them.  Bonehead!!  So if anyone knows what
I'm talking about and where I might find some I would greatly appreciate it.
 I would like to replace my stock covers with these until I find or can
afford some alloy rims.

BTW, I meet this Westy owner in Rio Vista while windsurfing for a week in the
Delta.  Lots of Buses and vans of all years and shape.  I was to busy sailing
to really get a chance to meet all of the VW owners, but I finally found a
Westy owner that was as anal (maybe more) than me about their van!!  It's
nice to see pride in one's obsession?
