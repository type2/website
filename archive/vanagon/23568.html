Subject: re: piston slapped

&gt;You can bet I'll be listening hard upon start-up for the dreaded EV
&gt;&quot;diesel&quot; sound.  Unless there's some difference between the motors, I
&gt;would think all gas engines have, or will develop, this problem.  Did they
&gt;have to take the head off to diagnose it?  Did they say how they're going to
&gt;fix it?
&gt;
&gt;I wish you luck!

No, they didn't have to do anything other than listen to it. I seem to
remember them telling me they used a stethoscope to localize the problem.
They told me it was cyclinder #2 that was the culprit!?

Anyway, in the short run it's not a big problem. I'm driving the car until
the details such as parts availability get worked out. I also haven't yet
discussed the nature or scope of the repairs. I should know more later this
PM. I'll keep you posted.

Thanks,

Jeff
