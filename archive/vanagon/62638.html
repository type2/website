&gt; I want to thank everyone for the help on my problem (losing power climbing
&gt; I-80 up to Lake Tahoe.)  The winning answer was the O2 sensor.  When it was
&gt; unplugged, the problem disappeared.
&gt; 
Of course!  ALWAYS suspect the 02 sensor!

&gt; I had the choice of replacing it with a generic sensor for $44, or a Bosch
&gt; for $85 (single wire).  I went with the Bosch, and also decided to let German
&gt; Motors  in Lake Forest do it (aka George's), based on recommendations from
&gt; several of you.

Look, I don't want to ruin your day...but I will anyway.
I just bot a Bosch 02 sensor for $20 at Western Auto.


  While looking things over they found a lot of parts that
&gt; were cracked, decrepit, or out-of-date (expansion tanks, distributor cap,
&gt; rotors, plug wires, temperature switches).

(Surprize, surprize)

  It was akin to a house
&gt; remodeling.  I'm now up to date.  I also found George to have a much more
&gt; proactive (and probably more expensive) approach the Fred's Garage in Redwood
&gt; City, where I usually take my '85 Westy.  George seemed to have good reasons
&gt; for all the changes.

If the other parts were priced in line with the 02 sensor, I could come
up with a few good reasons myself!


   Have others seen this difference?  The reasoning I got
&gt; at George's seemed sound.  Fred's just seems to fix what is broken, and not
&gt; be concerned with parts that can be updated or improved.

I think I would stick with Fred, and buy my parts myself!
