Subject: Re: Triangle, NC Bus gathering next weekend

Finally a bus gathering in my city, when im in town...and whats the 
reason this time for me not being able to show up, its the night of my 
prom, I can't miss my prom, for as much as I would like to hang out with 
other bussers and go camping, I must say, my date most likely wouldn't 
agree to that instead of prom, he's a saturn driver, he just doesn't 
understand busses, atleast I got his respect for it, once I let him try 
to drive it, anyways, I just thought I would share...maybe next 
time...unless prom gets cancelled, oh well, have a great time...Dallas
