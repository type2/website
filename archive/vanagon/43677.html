Subject: Why is &quot;reply to&quot; the poster, not list?


Why does the list use the message poster in REPLY TO and not the list?  I
haven't seen any of my posts, and realized when compared to another list
I'm on, the REPLY TO should be the list, not each individual poster, as
vanagon stuff is!  Is this a quirk of the list mail sent just to me, or is
everyone like this?  Now I must remember to retype the address, or
reforward my messages to list address!    Mike Benthin, 78 Westie, 75 bus,
