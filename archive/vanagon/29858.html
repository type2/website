Subject: Trip to Mickey's House (part 1, long)

All,

I can't imagine why, but I thought you all might enjoy my trip report to
Disney, and back, in the recently untested 79 Westy I purchased a short while
back.


To Cetin Seren:

I'm sorry I did not contact you while at Disney, but I was out voted on
anything that did not involve Disney, Disney, or the other members of my
travelling group.  Maybe next time, eh?

Now on with the show,

David

SENT 11-29-95 FROM GOLDBERG_DAVID

     It was a dark and stormy night in Austin Texas (actually it was
cool and clear, if I remember correctly :-)).  I had been scurrying
around getting the Westy ready for the the trip to Disney all week as
I had no intention of taking the Chevy Celebrity on this trip!

     All was ready for the inevitable. I had changed the points,
plugs, spark plug wires, oil, and oil filter.  I also had a trusted
mecahnic do some last minute checks to make sure I had not screwed up
anything (fortunately I had not).

     We were ready.

     To start of I got off work late, 1:00 am.  Wife forgot the
cameras.  We finally get on the road a 1:30 am, 17 Nov 1995.  Fill gas
tank on the way out of town, odometer reads 96117 (why I remember that
I can only guess).  Cruise down US183 to US290, and head for Houston.
We need to make Baton Rouge by 9:00am to pick up my wife's sister, as
she decided to invite herself along for the ride.  Donna, my wife,
figures we will make it by about 8:00am, and give us an hour to rest.
Needless to say she grossly underestimated the amount of time it takes
to drive from Austin, TX to Baton Rouge, LA.  She had calculated our
ETA based on an AVERAGE speed of 70 M.P.H.!  This route is not rural
interstates, it is 2, and 4 lane hiways to Houston, and 55 MPH
interstate through Houston, and to the other side of Baton Rouge,
where her Aunt and Uncle live, which is where we are to meet her
sister.  At 8:00am Donna decides that we are not going to make our
appointed rendezvous, and we stop to call and change our ETA, to
whenever we get there.  In typical south Lousiana style, the long
distance carrier that was chosen for us by our particular phone, could
not seem to connect any collect calls. We find out when we arrive in
Baton Rouge, that we had panicked everyone, because the calls could
not be accepted by the reciever.

     As we leave the town of Vidor, in east Texas (some of you may
recognize the name, for those who don't, this town has no black people
in it, and when one moves in, he/she/they leave shortly thereafter,
and in a hurry) I notice a police officer behind me.  I glance at the
speedo to ensure that I am not speeding, and continue on following a
semi that I have been behind for about 20 miles catching its draft,
and conserving gas.  A few minutes later I glance up in my rear view
mirror and notice the same officer still following.  I look at the
speedo to see if I was giving him a reason to follow, and I notice
that we are going 60 mph (the semi, me, and the officer following),
and the speed limit is 65.  While looking at the officer, I notice
that he has his radio mike to his mouth, and he is talking on it.  I
couldn't believe it, I was going 5 mph less than the posted speed, and
he was calling my license number in to see if he could pull me over
for any reason!  Apparently my plates were clean, because he then went
on by with a disgusted look on his face.

     When we make it to Baton Rouge, I finish up some of the work that
I could not get to before we left.  I change the right side brake
pads, only the left were worn, but I decided to change the rights,
after I noticed a great increase in braking ability on the left side,
and I grease the right side front wheel bearings.  Both Donna, and I
did not think that this quick bit of preventative maintenance was much
to worry about, but Ashley, Donna's sister, thought otherwise.  She
nearly had a coronary when she saw the front up on a jack, and the
wheel off, and brake pads lying on the driveway.  Later I found out
that she told Donna, that we could still take here Dodge Ram Charger,
instead of the Westy.  In true VW spirit, she quickly refused the
offer, expressing her distaste in travelling in anything less than our
Westy (I've got her trained ;-)).

      As we leave Baton Rouge, I asked only one thing of the intrepid
travellers who joined me on this quest for Disney:

                             Think happy thoughts!

      I explained how the van feels our general emotional state, and
reacts accordingly.  My request was met with skepticism, but all
obeyed without question (Argh Matey, ye better listen to yer Capn' or
else!).

      For the rest of the day we cruised along enjoying the scenery on
what has to be the most boring interstate in these united states.
Finally we reach Mobile Al.  Nice town, huge harbor. I remembered
someone mentioning a tunnel you need to look out for, as there is a
sharp turn leading up to it.  As I mention it to my wife, who is
taking her turn driving, the warning signs pop up, and she jumps on
the brakes to slow down enough to make the turn, only it wasn't as
sharp as the warning signs made it out to be. Oh well.  My daughter
got a kick out of driving under water :-).

      About this time it was starting to get dark, we reach the
Florida state line.  Ahh we are almost there! &quot;Dear look at the map,
how far is it to where we meet I-75?&quot;  &quot;About 5 hours&quot; &quot;5 hours?! This
trip will never end!!&quot;:-(.

       Finally about 3:30 am saturday we reach Kissimee, FL.  Since
Donna's sister made the reservations, we assumed (never assume
anything) she knew how to get to our hotel. Of course we were wrong.
The only information we had, was that it was 1 mile from the park
entrance.  Ashley wanted to drive to each park entrance and drive away
from it 1 mile along every road in the area.  We later found out the 1
mile from the park, means 1 mile straight line distance, not driving
distance.  When we finally asked directions and found the hotel, it
was more like 10 miles driving distance from the gate.

Part II to follow
