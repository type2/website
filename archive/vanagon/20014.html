Dan,

When your wrench shorted the battery the spark apparently triggered a
hydrogen explosion.  This is rather rare since the hydrogen usually escapes
in a concentration too low to sustain combustion.  But I know a guy who had a
similar experience with a motorcycle battery that apparently had a blocked
vent.  We found one shard of the battery case on a shelf on the other side of
his garage some days later.  

This is the kind of accident most mechanics ignore... until it happens to
them.
