For the big scramble and pancake cook-off we should have some good
coffee, don't you think.  Do you remember the scene in City Slickers
when they start a stampede with a modern convenience?

Carol and I will bring lots of Peete's coffee, and some juices (orange,
grapefruit, etc), and some cream for the coffee too.

John
