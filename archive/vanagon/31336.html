&gt; ROTARY SWAP INTO VANAGON
&gt;
&gt; two quick questions: what was the first year of the 2.1l in the vanagon? and
&gt; does anyone know of a conversion kit available for an rx7 rotary engine to be
&gt; transplanted into a h2o vanagon?
&gt;

Sean, Here is a post I received awhile back with RX7 question.  By the way,
Kennedy Engineering is in Los Angeles area and &quot;Bridgeport&quot; refers to the
modification of individual intake ports to merged ports, a common racing
upgrade in Australia, I am told.  Hope this is helpful.
