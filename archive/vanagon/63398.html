Subject:      '87 tranny and other probs...

well, I took my '87 GL out for a good drive today to check out the
trans....yea, its been sittin for awhile.. :&lt;)
problem I'm having is that when I come to a stop in 3rd, or if I want to
downshift from third to second (sometimes), it hangs up, and I have to fiddle
w/ the gearshift to unstick it, but it will unstick. I was told by the PO
that the trans was bad. Other than that, the trans seems ok.  I crawled
underneath, and the linkage seems ok, so it must be hanging up in the tranny.

Also, there's a vacuum leak (whistle) noise coming from the engine at mid
throttle, it goes away at full throttle (when i step down on accel more)..any
ideas?

Also Also..  :&lt;)
theres a significant amount of oil that drips out real fast after shutoff
(its not burning oil, just dripping) towards the front of the engine...could
this be the rear main seal?
(you have to pull the tranny to replace that, huh?)

thanks in advance..  :&lt;)
