&gt; &gt; &gt;Can anyone furnish me with a schematic and some instructions.

&gt; &gt; Try JB Heater Service, 303-660-9032. He has been fixing gas heaters
&gt; &gt; for years, and may be able to get or recommend sources for literature.

Probably not very to people that he thinks will buy his service, at least 
that was my experience.  It's when you start pushing him for answers that 
he seems to go off the deep end.  I'd try Ark Mirvis first.
