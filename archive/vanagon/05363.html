Subject:      tools of the trade (fi and carb)

here are some other places that you guys and gals might want to get info
from:

Snap-On Tools                This will put you in touch with the
1-800-866-5748               Snap-On customer direct order program.

&lt;expensive. lifetime guarantee. even if you break a screwdriver, they will
replace it! but tracking down the little guy in the white truck to get the
new tool is a real pain. they do have pre-determined routes around the city,
and sometimes you can catch them that way (at Midas on Wednesdays at 11:00,
etc.)&gt;

Neward Enterprises, Inc.        Mityvac brake bleeding system
Mityvac Automotive Products Div.
P. O. Box 725
9251 Archibald Ave.
Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730-0725
(714) 987-8975
(800) 648-9822

&lt;all sorts of little hand-pump vacuum/pressure testers and tools. pretty neat.
not tooo expensive: one-man brake bleeder - $40. worth getting the catalog.
the brake bleeder tool can also be used to test vacuum lines and vacuum-
operated devices, like vacuum-advance on a distributor, etc.&gt;

Auto Expert Products         Gastester CO meters
2574 NW 29th Drive           Eezbleed pressure brake bleeding system
Boca Raton, FL 33434
(800) 795-6958

&lt;CO meter for about $150. if you want dwell and timing on it, $200. also
a pressure-siphon brake bleeder. uses air pressure to force the fluid into
the car's reservoir. looks like it might be easier than then Mityvac, but i've
already got the Mityvac, so ... &gt;
