Subject: Re: Painting Pop-Top?

If it is peeling, it has been painted before, which must have been done by
a PO, since it was gelcoated, not painted, when new.  Gelcoat doesn't peel.

If you paint over peeling pain, the old paint will continue to peel, and
when it does, your new paint will come right with it.  Remember, your new
paint will be sticking to the old paint, not the poptop.  Your best bet for
a lasting job would be to get it all off, not just what is peeling.  Could
be a big job.

As for what kind of paint to use?  Go to a good boat shop and tell them
what you have.  They will be familiar with fiberglass repair and
refinishing.  The most permanent solution is to apply new gelcoat.  Next
best would be a good two-part marine paint -- sets in 1/2 hour or less, and
kind of tricky to use well, so practice first.  Also pricy.  Third choice
would be a one-part marine finish of some kind.

&gt; The white paint on my pop top is peeling, and I was thinking about 
&gt; painting it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know what would be the best paint to use?
&gt; 
&gt; Is it OK to just paint over the peeling paint?
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions would be great!
