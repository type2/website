James -

I have Curtain Kits for both the Bus and Vanagon Models.  Complete with
new rods, bottom shock cords, hardware and pre-sewn material for $169.00
plus UPS.  Also includes the large privacy curtain that surrounds the
front door windows and the windshield.  I also carry the Rod/Cord Only
Kits for those who wish to make their own curtains (comes also with
patterns and measurements for this).  Much better rods and harwdare than
the factory stuff IMHO.  I get a lot of Westy Owners replacing them with
these as well as regular Bus and Vanagon volks who just want a nice pair
of curtains for privacy.

Colors available are Grey, Brown and Blue.  I usually have Beige, but I'm
out of the material right now (ran out this summer).

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;        Can someone suggest where I would find a good set of curtains
&gt;for my
&gt;90 Vanagon ?  Are they sold by mail order ?  I didn't see any on offer
&gt;by Bus
&gt;Depot on their website, so hopefully there are other suupliers.
&gt;
&gt;        Any suggestions or comments are welcome.  Thanks !
