What years does it cover?   Info like this is invaluable.  I love being able
to look up part numbers etc, and have spent probably too much on dealer shop
manuals (The old blue hardbound ones), hours at kinko's photocopying - do you
realize it cost $70 to copy a 74 bug parts list? plus hours of page flipping!
 etc, but then it's right there!  The engine section is great.

If it's the complete set, I'd think it's very reasonable. If I were you, 
I'd buy it and offer what I don't need to other list members, 
distributing the expense. What years does this include?

I'd buy the fiche for '71 in a heartbeat! And if they'd offered me that 
deal, it'd already be in my hands....of course, I'm an information addict 
as well as a VW addict, so that kindof explains my attitude.

Thanks! Joe
