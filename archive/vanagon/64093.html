Being the father of and raising/having raised 8 kids and in addition =
having been foster parent with my wife to too numberous others to clearly =
recall or keep track of (how else do you think I got so many kids?) =
(early senility) this issue brings into focus an item (of many) that I =
have so many times tried to teach my kids -

Other than your loved ones, the most valuable thing you have, beyond =
ANYTHING else is not your car, nor your house, nor your &quot;fill in the =

Nuff said!
