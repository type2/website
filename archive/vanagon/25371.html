Volks,
	The 1800 in my '72 Westy is running even better than before.  Except
that it still will not pass smog.  I took it in again last week and paid
to have it hooked up to the fancy smog machine.  HC emissions were
running 650-700 where the legal limit is 350.  The mechanic says,
&quot;probably a vacuum leak&quot;.  Yeah, but I already checked for that.
Plugged all vacuum lines and sprayed starting fluid around the base of
both manifolds.  They charge me $5 to use the machine (I have gotten to
know them well over the years and they don't make me pay for a formal
check until it will pass) and send me on my way.
	So, I take the bus to &quot;Peanuts&quot;, a VW repair place not one block
from my house.  They say they can't get to it for a few days, and that
they're not sure they can make it pass.   What to do?  I have to get
this bus smogged, registered, and out of my garage!  So, I reluctantly
park it back in the garage and piddle with the adjustments.  Thinking
about the vacuum leak again, I recall that I didn't do a very good job
of checking the base of the manifolds.  I had used a can of starting
fluid without a nozzle on it, and I couldn't direct the solution very
well, plus the can was almost empty.  I rummage around my bookcase full
of solvents and find a fresh can of Berryman carb cleaner with a long
plastic straw nozzle.  Perfect!  Sure enough, when I spray it behind the
#1 cylinder intake port, the engine stumbles.  Cool!  So, like, I ran
down to the parts place and bought 8 new intake manifold gaskets (hey,
they are $0.30 each!).  Whip off the right manifold/carb and replace the
gaskets.  Torque down the manifold again.  Start the bus up.  Runs worse
than before!!  Spray the bad spot, and the engine almost dies!  
AAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!
	I found the problem.  
	I bought new parts.
	I cleaned everything.
	I was careful.

	It Still leaks!!  What can I do?  These manifolds seal against the
heads with thin, metal gaskets.  I've never had a problem with sealing
them as long as the gaskets were new.  The surface on the head is
smooth, there is nothing getting in the way.  Does anyone have an idea
as to why I cannot get a seal between the manifold and the head?  The
only thing I can think of is to smear some RTV sealant on the
gaskets, but that makes a huge mess.  Still, that's what I'm gonna hafta
do if someone doesn't tell me what the heck I am overlooking...

Thanks in advance, 

-David
