Subject: 84 Vanagon Fuel Leak

Last night I was driving home from work when the power completely cut out.
I pulled to the side of the road and took out some flares to warn other
vehicles.  I walked about 100 yards to the rear of the van and lit the
first flare.  When I leaned down to set the flare on the road I noticed a
line of gas leading directly to a 2 foot diameter pool of gas directly
under the van's engine.  It didn't catch fire, but, a word to the wise be
careful with flares if you break down.

My real question:  Does anyone have any ideas about what would leak this
much fuel?  I has not leaked since I had it towed home.  I only seems to
leak when the fuel pump is on.  The leak seems to be coming from the right
front (FIF) of the engine.  The leak seems to have poured on the exhaust
pipe even with right edge of the license plate.  Anybody have any good
ideas where to start.  Oh, I also replaced the fuel pump last weekend.
Perhaps the increased fuel pressure burst a weak fuel line.

Thanks,

John Brown
