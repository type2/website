&gt; I never got 2 gallons in mine.  Of course, the bleeding thing is weird to me

&gt; really high, it runs all over the ground. Maybe I don't have the front 
&gt; raised high enough?  I like the coke bottle idea, but the same goes 
&gt; there.  If I open the bleed screw at the front, coolant just pours onto 
&gt; the ground ( and would fill the coke bottle in a hurry.)

If coolant is flowing out of the bleed screw, The rad's full.  It doesn't
need to be bled.
You aren't sopposed to open the expansion tank with the engine running

and to Donald, who asked what the overflow tank was for...
When the coolant heats up it expands, taking up more room (that's why 
you open the bleeder screw when the engine is getting hotter)
In the confines of the coolant system it is restricted from expanding
therefore building up pressure.  When the pressure gets greater than
what the cap is set for, the cap allows it to flow through that little
braided hose into the overflow tank.  When the engine cools off, it sucks
it back into the engine.
I don't know what your white smoke is... I'd have to see/smell/feel it.
sorry.

&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, the more information we can gather on bleeding, the better.  Does 
&gt; anyone else raise the rear, and can anyone else say why one 
&gt; should/shouldn't do so?  I can think of some reasons, but I have to go 
&gt; work on my intake air hose which has a BIG crack in it.  No wonder this 
&gt; thing always runs a little rough.

I've parked it back end high for initial filling, then front high for 
bleeding.
