As I read Bentley, yes, the stabilizer is bad.

&gt; Bentley describes a load test by engaging 4th gear, but no procedure for

You're right.  But Bentley's &quot;Idle stabilezer, checking&quot; section for air-
cooled vans reads exactly the same as the test for water-cooled vans for
vehicles with manual transmissions, and then has another test for vans
with automatic transmissions, which is:
    
          -apply foot brake
          -warm up engine until idle is less than 1,000
          -swich on all electirical equipment, including a/c
          -let engine idle and notice timing
          -place selector in a speed range
          -as engine drops below 940 rpm, timing must advance.

I can't imagine procedure is different for water-cooled vans.
