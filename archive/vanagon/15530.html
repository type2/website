&gt;
&gt;&gt;The body.  Is the transaxle strap in good condition?
&gt;
&gt;I don't _have_ a trans strap - I'm using a solid trans mount.  Solid meaning
&gt;all steel.  It sucks, but thats what ya gotta do to get a tunnel case
&gt;trans in a splitcase bus.

My humblest apologies.

I would check the resistance between the mounting bracket of the soleinoid 
and the negitive terminal on your battery.  

You said that you have no juice anywhere, right?

What does the starter soleinoid have to do with it?

If you have no ignition ie. terminal 15 on the coil, look elsewhere first.
