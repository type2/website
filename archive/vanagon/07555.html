Subject: Why are my brakes dragging!!??

I posted a few weeks ago about my brakes, recieved some tips, followed 
some advice, and they're still dragging! :-( I've replaced the master 
cylinder and both rear wheel cylinders with new brazillian parts and my 
rear brakes still drag. If I adjust the shoes (via the adjusting stars) 
away from the drums, they work fine for a few miles and then start 
dragging again. The return springs appear fine, although I have not 
replaced them (this would require endless scrounging through a junkyard). 

Any ideas?
