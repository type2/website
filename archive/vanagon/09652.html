Subject: Dealer service ripoff?

Short version:  my wife's '90 GL lost two belts this morning, the belts
tried to eat the dipstick, lost some coolant as it got hot.

AAA'd it to the dealer and said, &quot;while your at it&quot; look at the brakes, do
the recall for the A/C ducts, etc...

They say the brakes need work.  And that VW says &quot;thou shalt not machine
rotors or drums&quot; and they'd have to be replaced.  Material cost for rotors,
drums, pads and shoes: $600.  Labor: 4 hours front, 4.5 hours rear.

My guru says that this is a bit much.  What says the group?
