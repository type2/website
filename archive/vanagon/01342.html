Definition of Diesel Vanagon:

  &quot; A large vehicle with an engine which is designed to leak diesel fuel
    and really gross motor oil. If you find the leaks, the engine is 
    designed to produce different leaks, keeping the horsepower/leak
    ratio constant at 1 leak per 24 horsepower. This feature is called
    'Leak Redundancy'.&quot;

IN two months of ownership..the leaks I have found.

 1) rear-most injector (Diesel)
 2) Bleeder Valve (I think) on injector pump (Diesel)
    (Which occurred because the in injector was fixed...)
 3) Fuel tank (Diesel) (Started to leak after I finished finding/fixing
                        the injector pump)

 4) Valve Cover Gasket (Oil) *All* the screws were loose

 5) Oil fill tube connection to oil-pan (Started leaking after
     I fixed number 4) (Both screws were loose)

 6) Oil filler cap (I fixed number 4 and didn't torque-down the flippin'
     plastic cap - I learned the value of twisting it on *real* hard.

 7) Some other oil-leak which has just popped up.

So I still have #7 and #4, and my driveway is a toxic waste dump.  The
little lawn-mower engine vibrates so much that nothing stays tight.
Also, nothing ever rusts with the layer of coal-tar oil on it...

I was considering replacing the fuel tank..but thought &quot;Naah, I'll just 
keep it below half&quot; So I did that, I was commenting to myself

  &quot;Gee, the fuel gauge is MUCH more accurrate than the one in my
   cars..., the gauge doesn't &quot;fly&quot; to empty once it falls below 
   1/2... I think I will write to the list and comment on this&quot;

Wednesday I was towed home because NuBus wouldn't rev faster than Idle.
To make a long story short, the gauge read 1/4 tank left (Gee..plenty 
of fuel..let's check the filter...the fuel lines...injector pump...
hmm... all look ok...what the heck, I'll add a couple of gallons..vrooom!)

...So I guess I replace the tank *and* the sending unit.
