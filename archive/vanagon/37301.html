&gt;I have an automatic 86 Vanagon w. air. Yesterday, I was driving along and
&gt;my coolant tempature gage light went off. I checked my coolant expansion
&gt;tank and it was empty. I refilled it and light went off and everything was
&gt;fine. Today , I checked the coolant and it seemed lower than when I filled
&gt;it, but not as low as yesterday.  There seems to be no puddles of coolant
&gt;forming under the car or visible leaking.  Could this be a fluke, bad water
&gt;pump or the dreaded head gasket. Thank you for any advice.

You are leaking fluid somewhere and the system may need to be bleed.
 External leaks are usually easy to find. Heater core leaks and internal
leaks more difficult.  Consider having engine leak down tested to ensure no
internal leakage of coolant into cylinders or worse, combustion gases into
colling system.
