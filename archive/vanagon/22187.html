Edvard said,

&gt; 	My dad and me have spent a couple of days taking the engine out and
&gt; 	apart and have found that one piston has broken and/or melted, damaging
&gt; 	a lot of other internal parts (and another piston).

It sounds to me like something was making that cylinder run extra 
hot, like a too lean mixture or timing way off. I had a beetle that 
did that and it turns out the fuel pump was sluggish. 


&gt; 	Most of the shops say that I can't use a beetle engine, because it
&gt; 	does not have the same mounting points as a bus case.

&gt; 	Can anyone please say if I can use a beetle engine without modification.
&gt; 	Or, if not, what modifications have to be made ?

I think you need to get the adapter for the rear mount that bolts 
to the oil pump.

Rich.
