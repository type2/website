Well if someone probably gave Bill up in Redmond a nice old Split Bus I'm
sure he'd put a one click button in Win 95 so all they have to do is click
and get the mail!



&gt;        I can see easy, concise, single placard instructions for the
&gt;purchase of a computer, the rebuliding of a late model 3/4 clutch hub and
&gt;how to buy a computer. But how to jaoin the Vanagon list in clear concise
&gt;terminology that even purveyors of Muir can understand???   It'll never
&gt;happen.    ;-)
&gt;
