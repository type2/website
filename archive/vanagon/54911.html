Hi, The weekender, and the camper rear cushions seem to be somewhat a scarce
commodity. more than half of the weekender, and campers i've seen have the rear
cushions missing. From what I gather, they are taken out at the local repair
shop to access the engine, and then are set on the floor of the shop, and
commandeered by the shop dog to use as a doggy bed.  If you're lucky enough to
get the cushion back, it is usually full of tooth marks. 

as far as the engine hatch cover, all the aircooled ones I've seen have been
metal with that tarry coating on them and the foam waffle underneath. All the
waterboxer ones I've seen have been that white plastic with the foam waffle
underneath.
