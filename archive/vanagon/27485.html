    Yeh!! and to add - think MICKEY MOUSE spells DEAD, install all 
heaters by the book, and if the book doesn't mention indoors 
installations, get something that does.

&gt;
&gt;With all the recent discussions about adding additional heaters, 
auxiliary
&gt;heaters,  space heaters, furnaces, etc. to camper vans or just plain 
vans
&gt;(wouldn't have anything to do with the coming winter would it?)  it 
occurs to
&gt;me to offer this suggestion to the group at large :
&gt;
&gt;If you are planning to augment the engine heat with some (any) kind of
&gt;additional heater, especially for use in winter camping, long drives, 
and/or
&gt;while sleeping in your camper, invest a few bucks in one of those 
battery
&gt;powered carbon monoxide  (CO) gas detectors.  These are the CO analog 
to the
&gt;home smoke alarm.  They could save your  life sleeping in a small, 
poorly
&gt;ventilated heated camper.  I'd hate to loose anyone of you to CO 
poisoning!
&gt;
&gt;Regards
&gt;Harvey
