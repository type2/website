Subject: More on engine life

When we bought our '86 Caravelle it had had almost exactly 100 kkm (let's
say 63 kmi) and there was evidence of outside head-leaks. The &quot;coolant&quot; was
the 100% natural tap water variety. There were 6 PO's and it was no beauty.
Still isn't. Well, we got it cheap.

Conclusion:
With a lot of creative driving and artistic maintainance you can break one
of those engines pretty quick. Perhaps the climate helps, too.

A VW repair shop recommended a treatment with &quot;Bar's leaks&quot;, some expensive
crud you put in the coolant tank. That was no good, so I pulled the leaking
head and did the gasket replacement thing. Interestingly enough, I didn't
find much corrosion on the head, only that the rubber gasket was very badly
out of shape. I suspect the head was mis-torqe-ed at some time or other.
This was two years ago, and no leaks since. I'm waiting for the other (port
side) head to start leaking, and I'd like to keep waiting.
