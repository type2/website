Subject: Re: Dometic Refrig finally working on gas

     I have driven many thousands of miles contiguously with the 
     refrigerator in my westy running on propane while driving (three 
     trans-american trips in the last two years).  
     
     I've never had a problem with the flame being extinquished.

could change the aerodynamics of the cavity.  After cleaning things out 
well, with the refrig still running on gas, I took the van on a couple of 
errands and much to my surprise, the flame did not get blown out!  Cool 
(Cold inside).
