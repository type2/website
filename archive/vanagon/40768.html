&gt; I am about to order a GEX longblock for $800.  If you have ANYTHING THAT IS
&gt; POSSIBLY BETTER LET ME KNOW!
&gt; 
&gt; I am in Stockton, CA which is near Sacramento.
&gt; 

A couple of weeks ago we bought an engine mail-order form Pro-Tech in
Riverside, CA, for $495 plus $125 shipping and $150 core. Friendly
and helpful people. See their ad in VW Trends. It runs well. No
problems yet. We've already put a couple of thousand miles on the new
engine with no leaks.

About 8 years ago I bought an engine from GEX. It was ok, but on a
long roadtrip about two weeks after installing the engine, we had to
stop and let the engine cool for four ours so that we could readjust
the valves. The valves were correct before starting the the trip.
BTW, GEX is really picky about the core. They said that mine was
worthless.
