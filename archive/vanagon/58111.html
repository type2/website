&gt;      I am still having trouble with my 82 diesel.  It is not reving up
&gt;under load, ther is air geting into the fuel (Ican see it in the clear line,
&gt;it is most visible when I turn the engine off) I am deting ready to replace
&gt;the line from the tank to the filter, does that sound reasonable?

My experience with not reving up under load, was a clogged fuel filter,
I did not notice any air bubbles in the line at the time.  It would seem 
that an air leak could cause similar trouble. Did you check at the
fuel filter, possibly the small brass screw that is loosened when you
drain water out the bottom of the fuel filter?  or the water drain?

Just a guess, good luck
