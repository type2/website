Subject:      did we lose another one?

well, i certainly hope Ralphie Boy Nader doesn't find out about how poorly
a vanagon (and a winnebago) came out in the California 60-ton Crash Test!
i mean, he'd probably sue VW (and Winnebago) for failing to design a van
properly &quot;for normal daily driving accidents&quot;. :)


now, lemme see here now ... San Diego tank crushes vanagon. but Dave Phillips
sees Germans running around in vanagons, chasing tanks in the desert. hmmmmmm.
