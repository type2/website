&lt;Scott asked where Elizabeth Furnace was&gt;

Eliabeth Furnace is a National Forest Service Campground wihtin the George
Washington National Forest.  It is basically at I-66 &amp; I-81 near Front
Royal.  It is roughly a 1-1.5hr drive from DC.

I am assembling a list of alternate suggestions and supporting
votes as they appear on the list.  If you want either to make and
alternate suggestion or support one of the previously mentioned alternate
sites (so far Pine Barrens, NJ; Assetegue, VA; and Seneca Rocks, WV),
please let me know.
