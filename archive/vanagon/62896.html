Subject: Knock, knock! (Who's there?)

     Well, the Vanagon list is as good a place as any for comiseration!
     
     I fear the engine in my '91 may be on its last legs.  This morning I 
     noticed an engine-based clicking-knocking which wouldn't go away after 
     a warmup and a short drive; I don't think it got any worse either, but 
     I'm afraid, very afraid.
     
     Like a cricket in the house, it has so far proved impossible to 
     localize the sound.  The sound has more resonance than that made by a 
     weak lifter, but I'm not entirely convinced that it's a rod bearing - 
     yet.  It could be an exhaust leak, just maybe, so I guess I'll run the 
     thing up on the ramps this evening and nose around a bit.  Maybe I'll 
     put a can of Alemite CD-2 in it just to fully eliminate the lifters as 
     a possible cause.
     
     Meanwhile, in anticipation of the worst, I'll try and guess the right 
     words to search the archives for some rebuilding tips.  Meanwhile:
     
     1. Any reason why I can't do the work?  I've got Bentley!  (and I 
     worked my way through college as a VW mechanic - 15 years ago - and 
     have rebuilt at least 50 Type I, II, &amp; III motors plus at least 10 
     Type IVs).
     
     2. What's this I hear about oversize P&amp;Ls?  Are they worth it?
     
     3. Anyone have any mild cam work done to improve the bottom end (I've 
     got an automatic which is pretty sluggish until it hits about 2K on 
     the tach).
     
     4. As far as checking the rods goes, one technique for a carbed engine 
     is to successively pull each plug wire (and then replace it before 
     moving on) to check for a diminishing knock.  Could I accomplish the 
     same by pulling the injector power?  (Tired of getting shocked!)
     
     Thank goodness I made it back from Denver last weekend!
