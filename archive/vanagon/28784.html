Subject:       Parting out busses

I was planning to work on a couple of busses that I own, but,
because of the cold weather and lack of storage, I have decided to
part them out. 
'70 Westy, some major rust, but 85% complete
'73 Westy, no pop-top, good sink, complete
'73 bus, Automatic, solid body, no motor, trans in unknown cond.

If interested, please respond via E-mail, or call Brian or Josh at
(303) 868-8313 or 333-3249 in Denver, CO USA.
