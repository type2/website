Subject: Re: Help replacing A/C hoses on '89 Vanagon!

&gt;Hi,
&gt;My Vanagon has developed a leak in the long A/C hoses that run the length of
&gt;the car.  Has anyone replaced them before?  How long should it take?  Where
&gt;should I get new ones?
&gt;

I had to replace one of mine a while back.  I removed the hose and took it to
a local A/C wholesaler/shop who re-used the ends and made me a &quot;new&quot; hose.  I
don't recall the specifics, but I do remember that it saved me a bundle
compared to the dealer price$.  If you're interested in doing this
mail-order-style, I could dig out the name/number/address of this Southern
California shop.
