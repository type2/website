RE:	Copy of: for Friday

&gt;I knew about the oil filler extension tube, the stove cover/drainboard, and
&gt;the swivelling front seats.  What I want to know is, where do you store the
&gt;gorilla required to swivel the dang things?!?

Ahh yes... the Gorilla is stored in the aux. batt. box under the drivers seat
that some Vanagon owners don't apparently know about.   :&lt;)
