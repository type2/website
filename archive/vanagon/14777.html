&lt;CLIP TO SAVE PRECIOUS BANDWIDTH/TROPICAL RAIN FOREST&gt;

&gt;     I was driving my SO's BMW, and I waved at a couple of other people in
&gt; similar cars, and I either got ignored or looked at like I was Charles
&gt; Manson's Evil Separated at birth Siamese twin.  And when I waved at a guy
&gt; in a bus while driving the BMW, I got a &quot;go stick it in yer : , you yuppie
&gt; scum&quot; look.  Sheesh!  The only ones that wave consistent;y are the early
&gt; bus guys and girls.  A couple haven't, which makes me think they are up
&gt; to no good, like stealing bus parts.  Somethimes I'll geta wave from
&gt; breadloafs, and rarely from a vanagon.   NEVER, evr have I gotton a wave 
&gt; from an EV, and a see 2 or 3 a day.

Hehe!   I have noticed the same thing.  When driving in my Audi, I 
have waved at someone with the exact same car, and get a stupid 
look, like 'why is that weird man waving at us,' and they speed 
off.

Whereas in the '67, you are almost guarenteed a 'peace' or wave 
from other pre '68's, and a wave from most bussers, and even the 
occasional bug.

Has anyone also noticed small childrens fascination with old Busses?  
It always makes me happy to see them stare and smile at me.
