Well kids!

I got out there in the cold air last night and found the Pioneer's 
serial number.

I unscrewed the corroded rusty plate there in the engine compartment, 
and took it inside.  A few minutes with brillo, and I was able to 
read her vitals.

325192 is the magic number.

I recall someone on the list having knowledge as to dates of 
manufacture based on the serial number.

I'm planning to send VW Customer assistance a letter as some have 
recommended,  (Thanks for the info!) but am curious to know more 
about it now.

The Placcard reads:

Volkswagenwerk GmbH.

Typ    VW2/24

What is the 24 on the Type 2 part?  Were the sub-designations 
according to type of bus (Kombi/Panel/Samba)?

Any info is of course appreciated!
