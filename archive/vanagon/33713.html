Subject: Re: Wavering Wannabus

My advise: If you're looking at an older bus, don't buy it unless you're 
willing to spend the time to learn about the bus and do much if not 
most/all of the work on it yourself. If you don't learn about it, it 
might leave you stranded.

That said, if you do buy an older bus, buy the best bus you can afford--I
bought mine for $700 and now have about $1500 total into it; would've been
better off spending $1500 up front.  Be sure to do a compression test on
it (experience talking here), and stay away from anything more than
surface rust--look underneath it too (more experience talking). 

Just my opinions...BTW, I'm still in the learning about my bus stage (6 
months later), but I figure I've only got another 6 months or so to kinda 
know what I'm doing.
