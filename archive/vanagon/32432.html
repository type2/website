	...or, Some People Just Shouldn't Own VW's

Well I bought the bus years ago from a junkyard for $600.  It landed 
there after the preacher who owned it died (I've had THREE buses that 
were formerly owned by preachers!).  When I got it, it had some 
*interesting* body conversions:

Cut wheel wells with fiberglass flares
2x4 Rocker Panel under cargo doors
6&quot; PVC Rocker Panel on driver's side

This last feature earned it the nickname &quot;the SCUD&quot;, because it looked
like a missle attached to the body.

After doing the mechanicals to get it running I drove it on and off
for over a year.

I didn't have it for sale, but this kid just kept coming back and
coming back trying to get me to sell it to him.  He finally wore me
down and I sold it to him.

I want to stress to you that the current owner is NOT a VW person 
(although I think he WANTS to be one)!  He has very little common
sense and everything he touches seems to turn to sh*t.  Shortly after
I sold it to him he called me up saying he could not get it started.
I drove out to rescue him and started going through it.  I always
check the ignition system first and everything was fine.  I then
began checking the fuel system.  I pulled the line from the fuel pump
to the carb and had him turn it over a few times.  No gas.  Went and
got a gallon of gas and it cranked right up.  I guess he thought $5
worth of gas would last several weeks.

Later he decided the original 1500 was not powerful enough.  Although 
the engine was somewhat tired, it still had between 105-115psi 
compression all the way around.  He asked what his options were and I
told him he should keep driving it and save his money for a complete
rebuild (as he was always a day late and a dollar short).  He didn't
like this idea and asked what else he could do.  I told him he could
just do a top end rebuild, but I wouldn't recommend it.  He asked how
big an engine he could build and I told him I wouldn't go bigger than
a 1641 with a single oil relief, single port engine.  So he asked if
he could work on it in my driveway and I told him yes.  I was working
on my 64 T34 Ghia at a friend's garage at the time and didn't have
time to give him a whole lot of help.  The heads were good (no cracks,
good valves and guides).  As he was putting it back together, I 
noticed he made several mistakes which I pointed out and had him redo.

The night before our VW show I saw he wouldn't finish in time so I
stayed up until 1:00am that night to help him finish.  The engine ran
great when I test drove it, lots of pep.  I think with the added 
stress of the bigger displacement it is only a matter of time before
the rod bearings start going though.  I am not a fan of top end 
rebuilds for Type 1 engines... some last, most don't.

Next he decided he wanted to convert from 6V to 12V.  I asked him
why and he said the engine still was not powerful enough for him.  I
tried to explain to him that the voltage of his electrical system
had nothing to do with engine power.  He then told me he wanted to
put a tape player in it.  I told him if it were me I would leave it
6V and carry a boom box (have you priced a 12V 9-pin flasher box
lately?).  He didn't want to listen, so I traded him a 12V flywheel,
clutch and pressure plate for his 6V and loaned him my grinder and
showed him where to grind out the transmission.  I told him he would
need to get a 12V starter and bushing, 12V generator and stand, 12V
voltage regulator, 12V flasher relay, voltage drop for the windshield 
wiper motor, 12V choke element, as well as all new 12V bulbs.

He changed the starter and generator and got impatient and wanted to
take it for a test drive that night.  He was really impressed with
how bright his headlights were but asked what would cause his 
generator light to stay on.  I tried to explain to him the reason his
headlights were so bright was because he had 12V going to 6V bulbs,
but he is no electrical engineer.  I then told him the reason his 
generator light was staying on was because he had not put in a 12V
voltage regulator and had fried the 6V one and possibly damaged the
generator.

Later he called me up and said he couldn't get it started and it was
backfiring up through the carb.  I asked what he had done to it and
he said he replaced the top half of the carb because a 12V choke 
element would not fit in it.  I told him he was crazy because I had
taken that carb out of my Thing and swapped the 12V element out for
a 6V when he rebuilt the top end (swapped him this 30pic2 for the
28pict that was in it so it would breathe better).  Went to look at 
it and had him turn it over for me a few times.  Gas poured out of
the top of the carb.  He's lucky it didn't backfire and set the whole
thing on fire.  

We took the carb apart because I thought the float was stuck.  It 
wasn't so I looked inside the top half of the carb and it didn't even 
have a float valve in it.  He asked if that was important.  I explained 
to him how the float and bowl of the carb works: as the gas fills the 
bowl, the float rises and actuates the valve in the top of carb, 
controlling the amount of gas taken into the carb.  Without the valve, 
gas is constantly pumped into the carb filling the bowl, then 
overflowing.

Put the carb back on, and knowing he had been washing the pistons
and cylinders with raw, unburned gas, I took out the sparkplugs and
put a few drops of oil in each hole and turned it over by hand
several times.  I noticed the spark plug wires were new and asked
him if he had just changed them.  He said yes, so I decided to check
his firing order.  Sure enough, he had them in the wrong order.
Fixed the firing order and it cranked right up soiling my jeans with
the leftover gas shooting out of the exhaust.

His battery kept going dead so he dropped the engine again to change 
his battery cables.  Don't ask me... I have no idea how his mind 
works...  He said he would jump it off when the battery was low but 
the next day it was dead again.  I asked how long he had driven it 
and he said he didn't, he just let it idle in the drive for 5 
minutes.  I tried to explain to him his generator could not charge 
the battery up at idle, he would have to drive it on the highway for 
30-40 minutes.

He called me up a couple of weeks ago because he can't get it 
started again.  I think I have done all the charity work I can do
for this kid at this point.

When I sold the bus to him he talked the big talk about restoring it 
and I believed him, or I wouldn't have sold it to him.  He offered to
sell it back to me for what he has in it and I seriously considered
rescuing it.

But I think of it now as she is my ex-wife and there was a reason 
for us to split up.  Now she has slept with another man and things
would never be the same between us.

But I'm not bitter...
