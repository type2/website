Subject: RE: Why is &quot;reply to&quot; the poster, not list?


&gt;Why does the list use the message poster in REPLY TO and not the list?  I
&gt;haven't seen any of my posts, and realized when compared to another list
&gt;I'm on, the REPLY TO should be the list, not each individual poster, as
&gt;vanagon stuff is!  Is this a quirk of the list mail sent just to me, or is
&gt;everyone like this?  Now I must remember to retype the address, or
&gt;reforward my messages to list address!    Mike Benthin, 78 Westie, 75 bus,

Ha... my mail program (MS Mail) does just the opposite. It always names
the list as the sender, so replies go directly to the list with no
intervention on my part... and I wish it named the individual poster
instead! I guess the grass is always greener...

                        /  \
                        \   \__
            _            \   \o\
