Subject: 91 GL Clutch

After 100+k miles the clutch on the 91 GL is causing shifting to be
difficult. I have looked over Bentley and found nothing about adjusting the
clutch.

Is there a possible problem with the fluid? Is there some way to adjust the
clutch travel? Is the hard shifting due to something other than the clutch?

Thanks,

Herb
