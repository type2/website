Subject: Re:  Seats for a '78 bus

&gt;
&gt;Dan I put a pair of nice vanagon seats in my '77 - slid right in 
&gt;with out a hitch.  Paid $65 for the pair.  I'm not sure what year
&gt;
 
I was told by a guy I know that other types of seats (ie. non-VW) will
slide right in also, but he didn't know what kind (he got lucky, very
lucky with the seats he was given).  Does anybody know what other seats
will fit?  I would like to get some with a headrest.

	Thanks,   DAN.
