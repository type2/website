Subject: Cold-Starting Problem



  I'm having a problem with an '85 Vanagon that I was hoping someone on 
the list could help me with.

  This particular model has no cold-start switch.  Starting it in warm 
weather is no problem at all.  But whenever the weather drops to about 50 
degrees or lower, the van will not start.  The starter turns over, but 
the engine will not engage.  The engine gives the impression that it is 
having trouble getting fuel.  Once the van has been started...even if the 
van continues to be cold and cuts off if you don't give it a lot of 
gas...it will continue to start.  It seems as if once the fuel begins to 
flow it will continue to flow, almost as if there is some pump-priming 
mechanism.

  When the temperature is below 50 degrees, the only way the van will 
start is with the aid of starter fluid.

  All of the mechanics I've talked to tell me that the Vanagon is a 
specialty item, vastly different from other VWs, and they have no idea 
what the problem is.  I could take it to a dealer, but I am a man of 
modest means.

  Anybody on the list have any ideas?  Suggestions?  Revelations?

  Thanks much.

Jesse Taylor
