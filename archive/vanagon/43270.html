Subject: Extractor systems..


&gt; I think I'm interested in a dual quiet pack for an early bus
&gt;(Type II engine).

Make sure this system is supported adequately in the rear as the
extended mass (weight) beyond the the engine may cause front
transmission mount (FTM) failure.. (e.g., added torque)  When I bought
my bus it had a broken FTM.  I replaced it twice before I replaced my
old extracter-single quiet pack with a stock muffler.  (I couldn't
believe the difference in weight.)  It has been a couple of months now
and my FTM is secure...
