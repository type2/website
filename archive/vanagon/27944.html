Todd S. doesn't expect daughter Willow to grow up with grease under her
polished nails.

But why not?  Here's a great 21st century story:  my nephew has had a suc-
cession of female pediatricians.  One day he asks his mother, &quot;Mom, is being
a doctor a girl's job, or can boys be doctors, too?&quot;  There's hope.
