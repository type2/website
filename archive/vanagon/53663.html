Subject: Help! Pwr. Mirrors PITA!!

How the hell do you remove the V-gon Pwr. Mirrors????
I took off the glass, and that little motor, I took off the doorpanel, and
unplugged the wire connection, But The stupid wire connectors won't fit thru
that little hole in the door!!
I tried to pull the wires out of the plastic wire connector but no-go. 

Grrrr.....I'm ready to cut the wires........  :&lt;(
