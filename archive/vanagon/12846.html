Subject: assorted miscellani


I am new.

	Both new to this list, having just discovered it, and new, as in new
owner of a 1978 WESTFALIA!  Whoopeeee!
	I looked high and low for a sweet deal, and found it.  I've spent 
the last month I've had it replacing this and that, minor stuff (ie: exhaust,
ignition, interior- curtains thanks to my lovely wife =)    )
	Here are my questions, for anyone kind enuf to help (who was it 
that said the only stupid question is one which goes unasked...)

	1.  antenna.  My bro just bought a 68 for parts, &amp; I snagged the 
antenna- mine's broked.  I can't figure out if installing it is possible
w/out removing the dash (the parts bus was easy- we reomoved the dash anyway)
Any suggestions?  It's cramped under there!
 
	2.  heater.  This isn't the first vw I've owned; that said, I know
they are a tad lacking in warmth.  But mine does work, at least the defrost
and leg area does.  What does not is the aux. heater situated smack-dab below
the guages, glove box etc. (the unit runs all the way across).  The round fan
knob activates the fan just dandy, but the temp. control knob is ineffective-
the unit only blows cold air.  O.K.- just one more...

	3.  steering.  Works, but on left turns, at roughly 1/4 turn of 
the steering wheel there's a spot difficult to turn past.  I can turn through
it, but it takes effort- a LOT.  Right turns are fine.  Steering gearbox 
maybe?  Maybe something less taxing on my wallet?  Am I dreaming?



				Any help greatly appreciated, for sure!
