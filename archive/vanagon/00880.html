&gt; a few words of caution to all you young whippersnappers out there:
&gt; 
&gt; i'd advise wearing at least one ear plug (like the kind you can buy for
&gt; shooting pistols ... the little foam thing that sticks in your ear) while
&gt; you are riding in your van with the window down.  i've got a 70 percent
&gt; hearing loss in my left ear, and i'm pretty sure it's because of all those
&gt; years of beetles, squareback, and buses running up and down the countryside
&gt; with only the 2/60 type air conditioning: 2 windows down and 60 mph. :)
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, i never noticed it until it was too late ... actually, i never
&gt; noticed it at all; the army did ... tested me six times (only when i was
&gt; leaving, of course!) ... thought i was faking it. then they asked me if i
&gt; knew i was deef!
&gt; 

A common Joel.  You know darn well it was really all those years of 
listening to Jimi Hendrix cranked up on your Heathkit stereo!  ;)
