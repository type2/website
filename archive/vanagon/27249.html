Subject: Bolt Broke in Head! AARGGHRRGH !!!

Hi All,
The engine swap on my 87 Syncro was going just fine until....
An exhaust manifold bolt BROKE OFF IN THE HEAD!
I had removed a combination of 15 nuts/bolts (8 on my 87, 7 on the &quot;new&quot; 90
engine) from where the exhaust tubing bolts to the exhaust ports on the
heads.  Then of course the last one HAD to break off in the head!

Then things got WORSE!  I used a lot of Liquid Wrench and a tool from Leslie
( spelling unsure, red &amp; white packages, sold in auto parts stores) called a
Super Out.  It's a small hardened shaft with splines down part of its length.
 Well, you pound it into the hole you've drilled in the bolt and the splines
cut grooves inside the hole.  Then you just twist it out.  RIGHT!

While pounding it in, the NOT-SO-SUPER Super Out broke off inside the hole in
the bolt!  Just a tiny little nib was sticking out from the surface of the
bolt.  While examining this latest problem, I notice that pounding this Super
Out AAR!RG!RG!RHH!H into the bolt has created a small CRACK IN THE HEAD
between the bolt hole and the external surface of the head!  It took about 45
minutes to get the brooken part of the Super Out A!AR!RG!RGRH!HH out of the
bolt.

Now I'm still left with a bolt stuck in the head with a hole drilled down its
axis and a small crack in the head.  I figure that although this crack is
small I must get it welded so that it doesn't get any worse over time.
Request #1:
I'd appreciate any suggestions/precautions on who/how to get this welding
done.

Request #2:
Aside from repairing this crack in the head, I've still got the bolt stuck in
the head.  I'd like to hear any suggestions on removing this bolt without any
further damage to the  head.  Also, which should I do first, remove the bolt
or weld the head?

Thanks for your responses.
