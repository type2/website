Subject: 1972 VW Bus, runs and all, for sale cheap
Date: 8 Nov 1994 09:29:26 -0500

Here's the deal:
1972 VW Bus, now has single carb.
Recent piston seal replacement.
Recent expensive brake overhaul I didn't understand.
Runs fine when I jump start it, probably needs new battery.
Yours for $400, includes 20 gallon fish tank.
It's painted a pretty green.
All the original interior stuff intact, except roof liner.
The catch?
No heat.
I've got to get rid of it because I'm moving.
Please respond quickly, via e-mail.
Thanks,
Robert M. Bryan
