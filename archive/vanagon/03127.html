Subject: Bug out



I know the bug out is comming up in  a couple of weeks, in Manassas VA.  I have
had a fruit full past year working on VW and I now have an extensive collection
of parts, that I need to get rid of.  Does anyone in the DC area know what is
involved in getting a table in the parts swap, if it is even possible, and the
costs.  

If it is not I got lots O cheap parts, including a complete 73 super, not worth
the attempt to restore, but lots of good parts.  Also many pancake engine parts
if anyone is interested.

Forgot to mention.  I have a recently rebuilt Tranny for a bus good for years up 
to 76, I think.  After that I think they got a longer drive shaft.

        TTFN
