&gt;&gt;Thought I'd announce that Stephen Connor Boleyn was born May 7, 1996.
&gt;&gt;He weighed in at 7 lbs 9 ozs, and measured 20 inches long.
&gt;
&gt; Our most sincere congratulations! It's great to be a parent!


And you're going to *need* your VW bus to haul all the diapers, toys,
blankets, carseats, etc.!   :^)

I got my '71 bus just as my son was turning 4 and graduating from carseat
usage. One of his first non-carseat trips was in the right front seat. 
But...
he was used to the stabilizing effects of the sides of the seat, which
most carseats have but the '71 bus didn't. So, he had no idea of how
to brace himself in a turn.

First gentle curve, and he went toppling off the seat, slipping completely
free of the shoulder harness and wound up suspended upside-down by the
tightly-cinched lap belt, his head about 3&quot; from the floor-- unhurt, but
with a *very* surprised look on his face.

He learned quickly after that.    :-\
