Subject:      FS: '81 Westi Sacramento $800

This was posted a couple of weeks ago.  I went out and checked on it for
Tobin
as a potential candidate.  He has opted out of this bus (for now) for
logistical
reasons, so allowing me to post details.  I have a dozen electronic
images of it
available, pages of detailed information, drop me a line if you want the
whole lowdown.
Here's the highlights:

1981, Chocolate Brown, original paint, three very minor dents, in VERY
good
condition, owner's uncle/aunt have it (they've had busses since '58).
Man I wish I could find a  '6X Deluxe this nice!  Anyway the owner had a
engine
problem (unable to talk directly to her, in SF bay area) but a shop in
Vallejo
tore the engine down, removed cylinder #3, and estimated $3500 for
fixing.
(the thieves) an AVP engine rebuild is $1200!  It's a non-CA engine.
Never
been repainted or hit, no rust except for where body dings are.

They got PO'd and towed it away.  It has been in Grass Valley since last
fall.
I did a check to see if all was there and found the distributor missing.
Owner
trying to get it back (good luck).

The seats have been replaced with T-bird seats.  Been stored under big
pine trees, so filthy, but out of the sun.

Couldn't find anything obvious (thrown rod, valve seat, etc.) that
caused the
engine to die.

I have two air-cooled Westi's, don't need another!
