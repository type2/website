Subject: I had to tell someone...

Sorry, but I just had to tell someone and y'all were the closest ones. 
On the way back from lunch just now, me and my co-worker found a check
on the ground for $10,000!!!!  Someone had withdrawn it from their
checking account and dropped it.  We turned it in to a branch of the
bank on the check, but I just got to thinkin'...that would have been a
nice down payment for a new EV camper...

No lie.
Ian
