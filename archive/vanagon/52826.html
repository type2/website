Nope, not at all.

&gt;I wouldn't give aid to an evangelist, but if you can give aid to some
children
&gt;in a developing nation, you should think about it.

Bravo.  I am a sponsor for 'Childreach' which appears to be a very
legitimate outfit.  Check them out at

&gt;I said too much.  Sorry, this thread should probably be taken off line.

I'm sure you're right.  Before I drop it, however, I would recommend that
everyone interested read the book &quot;The Missionaries: God against the
Indians&quot; by Norman Lewis.  Let me quote the blurb:  &quot;This book will make
you angry.  It is about genocide, practiced today, against helpless people
in the name of god.  These destroyers are called Christians...&quot;

I give 5% of my income to charity.  I don't give money to religious
organizations including Scientology, Christianity, the Witnesses,
Mormonism, or any other religion that actively recruits.
