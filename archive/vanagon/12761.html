Subject: Re: Simple hot water shower

Regarding a simple shower, I've got one as simple as can be.  It consists of 
a dedicated never used plastic insectide sprayer.  The container is about 2 
gallons in capacity complete with about a 3' hose and &quot;shower head&quot;.  Being 
relatively tall and narrow, it stores relatively easily and hangs in the 
corner of my &quot;shower&quot; stall when in use.

I simply pour ~3/4 gallon of regular temp water into the sprayer's 
container, bring ~3/4 gallon of water to nearly a boil, pour it in, put the 
nozzle/pump unit on, shake er up, pump er up and let the shower begin.  
Works like a champ.  You'd be surprised at how satisfying this small amount 
of water can be.  I don't fill it up to the top because there has to be air 
in the container because it's compressed air that provides the pressure.  If 
there's no enough air, you have to pump too often to keep the pressure up.

The entire affair could also do double duty by providing a portable low 
pressure water though I've never needed this.

Your thoughts?

&gt;This spring I intend to install a shower with hot water in my 28 ft.
&gt;sailboat.  I don't need a 110 volt water heater since I don't have to take
&gt;showers on the boat when I'm at my slip.  And my boat doesn't have an inboard
&gt;engine to heat water when I'm away from shore power, so that option is
&gt;unavailable to me.
&gt;
&gt;I want a very simple system that works.  The following idea should do the job
&gt;but I was wondering if anyone has a system that might be better.
&gt;
&gt;What I intend to do is construct a small hot water storage tank, well
&gt;insulated, and attach a single-faucet 12 volt electric pump to bring hot
&gt;water to the shower fixture.   Water will be heated on the stove and stored
&gt;in the small tank.  The cold water side is already pressurized with its own
&gt;pump.  When the hot water storage tank is full enough I should be able to
&gt;have hot and cold pressurized water to the shower fixture, where I can adjust
&gt;the water temperature for the shower.
&gt;
