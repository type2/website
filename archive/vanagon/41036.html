VW&gt;&gt; 
VW&gt;&gt; Ahhh!  I had no idea there would be so much traffic on this mailing list.
VW&gt;&gt; Is there any interest in switching over to a News group?  Has this already
VW&gt;&gt; been discussed?  I took yesterday off and had over 150 messages.

Gee Whiz, don't I remember about a year ago the conjecture was
that we were certainly about to peak and die off, splintering into
a bunch of faction.  We sure have come a long way.  Oh for the good
old days when we all received every reply, heck we'd be getting 500+
a day today.
