Subject: PNW Gathering of the Vans

Until June rolls around, I see the following 3-day weekends coming up:
january 13-15
february 17-19
march 30 - april 7
may 25-27

I'm going to rule out the week in early April because I expect to be
heading out to the desert then, and Memorial Day weekend is likely to be a
zoo anywhere we go. Hence I favor the Jan or Feb dates.

Places suggested so far:
NW Washington coast - beach camping or sites with electric are possible
here; scenic beaches, hiking/biking possible, not much else;
SW Washington coast (Ocean Shores) - not my favorite place, but sites with
electric possible; there are also taverns and much tourist accomodations,
beach is boring though;
Deception Pass - this has the advantage of being slightly closer for the
Seattle folks, not a bad campground if you don't mind the 'Sound of
Freedom' aka A6 planes with afterburners doing practice carrier landings at
night.
Mt Constitution - on Orcas Island, pretty far for everyone, but there are
the infamous hot tubs at Doe Bay Resort. Good biking on Mt Constitution
too.

whaddaya think?
