Michael,

I see you ride a Cannondale bike. I just bought mine and love it. It is
the forerunner to the Delta-V bikes of today.  The rear suspension is
passive.  The quadra 21-r on the front works well. I am amazed how light
the frames are on these bikes. I just hope they are not fragile!

Are you sure the camper was not pulling the vanagon??

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; On our way back from our weekly pilgrimage from Rhode Island to New
&gt; Hampshire in our '84 Westy,  we saw a most interesting sight.  We were
&gt; traveling down 128 (really 95 south), when my girl friend said look at that,
&gt; pointing to a enormous 30+ foot motor home trailer that we were approaching.
&gt; Never having seen such a large trailer on this road we both stared as we
&gt; passed it, what we saw next almost knocked me out of my seat.  This huge
&gt; motor home trailer was being towed by a ~89 VW Vanagon!   The Vanagon was
&gt; even keeled and travailing down the road at 65 mph.  This came as quite a
&gt; shock to me especially since I just spent the last 2 hours in NH trying to
&gt; get my unloaded Westy to go up the slightest of hills!   Anyway, is the 2.1
&gt; that much more powerful then the 1.9??  What gives here, I've never seen
&gt; anything like this and don't know if it's normal.
&gt; Next issue, heat.  I can't turn the heat completely off in my van.  I've
&gt; turned the control to the 'cold' setting and made sure the vents are closed,
&gt; but the center heating unit under the dash in the middle still heats up and
&gt; pushes hot air out around the closed vents.   This also happens with the
&gt; rear heater, even when the switch is turned to 'no heat' hot air still leaks
&gt; out.  Is this the price I must pay for heat during the winter, or is there a
&gt; way to turn the heat off completely?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike D.
