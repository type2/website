Subject: Re: optimal warmup time?

&gt;I think we started this thread once, but I can't remember the
&gt;concensus, due to my alzheimers-senility, or whatever that disease
&gt;was I had.  Anyway, how long should I warm up my car?
&gt;
&gt;/martha

I don't know where I heard this from 8-9 years ago but it did pertain to
VW's at that time specifically '83 GTI's, but I've always let it idle for
at least a minute and then drive easily (under 3000 RPM, light
acceleration) until the temp guage reaches the beginning of the white
lines.  I've used this method over all my VW's.  The GTI now has 137K on it
with no sign of wear and no internal repairs at all.  Bitter-sweet because
I want to put a new digifant engine or even a G60 in it as I autocross it
regularly!  Bruce
