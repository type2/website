i'm all up for people getting angry for stupid reasons!!!  so here
goes...
who the heck said that the reason oregonian's still have that law on
the books is so we and visitors don't have to get out of their cars
and smell fumes and be in the rain.  hogwash to you i say!  pure
smelly feces right there.  first of all at half the places you still
have to go inside to pay someone for the gas the person outside
pumped!  so you still smell fumes and still get wet (remember
everyone, it is ALWAYS raining here in oregon, ALWAYS).  the way i
understand it is the reason for the law is to provide low income jobs,
and a lot of them.  take a look at our unemployment rate, and yeah....
no sales tax:)  


oggg a da booog a da doooo.  rising to the bait and feeling like a
happy silly boy today i am!  ok, how about this... everyone stay right
where you are, don't travel because meeting new people and seeing new
things is much less intresting than television.  so stay home and
watch the boob tube and gripe about this and that.


ok, and also, how about a vw question here (for those of you actually
took the time to read this message and then read this far).   lets
talk maintenance.  i am getting better at working on my bus.  can
actually tell you what a few of the things in the engine compartment
are and even what some of the nameable things do.  someone send a list
of maintenance things for me to check.   who's replaced the clutch in
a 73 bus?  how hard is that going to be?

well, there you go.  take care everyone.  i think i will get back to
work now:)
