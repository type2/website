Subject: Re: CVJoints 84 Vanagon

Hi folks 
 I Am new at computers and this list.(Double trouble) This my third attempt
to send this message. If it doesn't go thru please help me with a reply of
what I'm doing wrong. I will pay anything you ask.
  I thought I'd share this money saver regarding CV joints on my 84 Vanagon.
One of my CVs was  making that dying clunking sound so when I went to replace
it I had to dismantle the old one to see what the damage looked like. I
disassembled and cleaned everything and discovered damage to all the races
that the balls ride in ( the balls themselves looked undamaged)  But the
damage was only at one end of the races. It looked like the balls had never
ridden in the other ends of the races. Apparently the normal axle movement (
at least on my van ) is not enough to make the balls move the entire length
of the races. ( Maybe on only the most extreme bumps ?) So I reassembled and
repacked it , turned it 180 degrees and put it back on the axle ( it's
symmetrical) so the balls are now riding in the never or little used ends of
the races. That was 20k ago. No more clunking. The new CVJ is still sitting
on my shelf.
  If you try this, be sure to put a directional mark on it before removing it
from the axle, so you can reverse it .
   Also, for damages balls, the bearing company I deal with (Bruening
Bearing) will mic. Old balls and sell individual new ones.
