Subject: re: VW awning?

&gt;
&gt;Ever heard of an &quot;A&amp;E&quot; awning? Saw one for sale in the local ad circular,
&gt;$125, apparently it clips onto the rain gutter. It's an awning only, no
&gt;walls/sides. Worth it? Not worth it? The couple who ran the ad said
&gt;they'd used it with their Vanagon. No, I don't have the money, but if I'm
&gt;going to be living in my Westy I wouldn't mind having some shade... hey!
&gt;what will I do for Internet access? Holy sh*t!!!
&gt;

I just saw one on a late-model Vanagon. The nameplate on it said that
A&amp;E was a division of Dometic Industries (the folks that make the fridge)
and they were based in Santa Ana, CA. I talked to the owner, he said he
bought it at the VW dealer. It looked pretty solid. I'd say it's a deal at
US$125.
