Subject: Re: Hands Across &quot;BOB&quot;

Y'all remember a few years ago a bunch of suckers and yuppies tried to have
Hands Across America? They played Yanni music, and ate quiche, parked the
Land Rover, held hands with complete strangeers without knowing where the
strangers hands had recently been and all cried, whimpering about Whales or
whatever? ;) Well we could have &quot;Hands Across Hoover.&quot; Treat Bob like a pass
around pack/Pony Express kinda thing! Everybody sign up for a twentymile to
two hundred mile stretch. One thing is for sure, at least you won't be out
of luck and with out a clue if you break down! 

&gt;hey there all,
&gt;	well, i don't know if he wants our help in this way but life
&gt;is meant to be new and fun and i think that driving a knowledgeable
&gt;and intresting stranger would be both.  anyway assuming that it could
&gt;be on a weekend (and hopefully not labor day as i will already be far
&gt;away from here) i could go visit friends in seattle and pick up bob
&gt;and take him to salem or eugene,  oregon, or is there someone who
&gt;could take hime from seattle to my home in portland and i could go a
&gt;little farther than eugene.  i've seen others say they will take him
&gt;from SF to salis and LA to home(?).  anyway, anyone else intrested?
&gt;it seems he has helped more than one or two people on this list and
&gt;that a good number of us here like him and his postings so what do you
&gt;say we try and make the net a little less anonymous and a little more
&gt;personable?  
&gt;
&gt;anyway, i'm feeling happy and feel like helping out.  hope others will
&gt;too.  take care all, i'll be asking questions again soon...

&gt;p.s.
&gt;i guess i could do this now also... HEY EVERYONE!  i'm brandy smith, a
&gt;24 yr old silly guy in portland oregon working for THE MAN (aka Intel
&gt;or other big buisness type place).  just left grad school not to long
&gt;ago and drove from south carolina to oregon in my 1973 blue camper
&gt;bus, taking time to KAYAK (my other love besides my bus), mountain
&gt;bike and hike along the way.   i am new to this mechanic thing but got
&gt;the bus to learn how, and fell in love with the big blue beast along
&gt;the way.  any other bus lovers in portland?  if so, any &quot;vw clubs&quot;
&gt;here that are worth checking out.  i really don't know any other bus
&gt;mechanics (even though there are millions of them in this city) and
&gt;would love to meet one or two.  anyway hope everyone has a good day...
