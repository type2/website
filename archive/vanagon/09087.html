Yo,

	Well, today at 6:00am I started on putting the new transmission in.
I'm pooped, and only halway done, so this will be short.

	Things to watch out for:
	
	1) you gotta open up the transmission on a split case transmission
       to get the axles out

	2) when you do get the axles out, they will not be the right size
       for a tunnel case transmission

	3) take off the REARWARD set-screw off of the shiftcoupler, before 
       trying to get the transmission out.

	4) the early reduction boxes look exactly like the later ones, on
       the outside, but the bearings are different sizes and the gears,
       while being the same size, have different numbers of teeth.  The
       brake backing plates are the same.

	5) that $30 Bus Boys trans adapter, while it fits the tranny and the
    	body, requires you to grind material off of the nosecone in order
       to actually get the ^$_at__at_!$##! tranny in the car.

    6)  dopey parts house people who don't know what they are talking about
       and couldn't find their ass in the dark with both hands, a flashlight
       and a bloodhound.

	7) the starter bushings in the rebuilt trannies are going to be for
       12V starters, even tho its for years that were 6V.  See #6
       
	Tommorrow, I get to do the welding on the back deck, and then finish 
	attaching the reduction boxes to the spring plates, and then putting
    the reductions back together.  Hope I've got all the parts, or I'm 
    screwed, huh?

Good night, and happy new year - is this the first post?
