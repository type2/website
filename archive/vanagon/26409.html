There is a Haines manual just for Webers -- I got one at MOFOCO a couple 
weeks ago for about $17 -- 
    BTW, does your carb have any numbers on it? I can't figure out my 
exact carb model -- it looks like the 32/36 DF something but the only 
numbers I can see are on the barrels, one says 26, the other 27, which I 
assume is the venturi size (then how can it be a 32/36?????)
  However, as to your jetting -- the plug ceramics should be brown, a 
nice light chocolate color -- darker is better, within reason -- it's 
safer to be a little rich, then too lean -- and the only way to really 
look at it is to run full throttle for at least 5 minutes under load, 
then hit the key off and immediately put in the clutch, etc. Stop, pull 
the plug. 
If you get it too lean, you'll burn a valve or even melt a piston. 
I've done it.

    All is impermanent, but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
Samurai is death --- so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace!
