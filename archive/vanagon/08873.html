this used to drie me nuts when i lived in chicago!! you'd think that
Yankees who were born and lived up there would have the common sense to
get as much visibility as possible, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ...

you know what one of them told me??? that it made the car warm up quicker!!!
cause the snow provided insulation!!! sheesh!

so, i don't know. and most other cars don't have nearly the window-space to
clean that a bus has. i think it has to do with the idea that &quot;well, every-
body else will miss me. THEY can stop before they hit me.&quot;  that mentality
seems to run rampant now and then ... they'll look right at you and STILL
put out in front of you!

AAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
