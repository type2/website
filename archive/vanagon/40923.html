Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)

I can second this kind of thing from Bus Boys.  I ordered a boxful of 
van parts from them, found I was missing a side bumper cover when the 
box got here, called them 3 times and each time was told &quot;um, ok, we'll 
ship you one right out&quot;, and still don't have my part 4 months later.  
I'd put the post office or the credit card folks onto 'em but for a $17 
part it's not worth the hassle.  

I'm now eagerly awaiting catalogs from some of the suppliers listed in 
the vanagon list FAQ.  BTW I've used Imparts for about 10 years for 
other german car parts with generally very satisfactory results and 
*competetive prices.*  They have gone a bit boutique lately, but 
nothing as bad as Griot's Garage.  Their parts are OEM, not factory, but 
the only time this has been a problem was when I took the new 911 brake 
rotors out on the track... the factory parts have a better stress relief 
or something, the OEMs did the potato chip thing.
