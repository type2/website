Subject: What's this clanking noise?

Hey now,
        I've got this funky clanking-clunking noise coming from the back.
It only happens when the car is in motion, so it's not the engine. Seems
like it gets noisier at around 30-40 mph and also when applying brake
power. My first thought was the tranny, but the noise happens while braking
with the bus in neutral. I checked the differential as per Muir, it's
within 1-2&quot; like he says.

        Anyone have any ideas? I can't think of anything back there that
would make this sort of noise other than the tranny. Tranny mounts maybe?
Please email me, I get the digest. Thanks for your help.

Peace,
