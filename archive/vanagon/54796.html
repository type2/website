Dan;
I used a decade resistance box as substitute input to the gauges and came
up with these figures:
For the gas gauge to read full (refer to illustration on page 90.20) an
input of 35 ohms was required. Empty required 210 ohms.or the coolant
gauge refer to page 90.21. For needle in position I input 340 ohms. For
needle in position II input 30 ohms. t appears actual resistance is
about 3/5 of dial reading on VW 1301 tool. Remember these numbers were
arrived by testing our two vehicles so results my vary, use only as
directed.
Good Luck

&gt;full. This is how they are tested and VW's black box tester procedure 
&gt;Anyone out there ever tested a known good one and know the proper
&gt;readings?
