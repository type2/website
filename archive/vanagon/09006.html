Subject: Re: cops and busses

&gt;
&gt;Since I am new to owning a bus and haven't even had the chance to
&gt;drive it around yet, I am curious as to what the attitude of cops have
&gt;been for people driving VW busses. Are you picked out and searched
&gt;often?


Speaking about Customs agents only, US and/or Canadian, We travelled often 
cross border, in a multitude of busses, Kombis, Westfalias. We were stopped, 
closely questioned, and very often searched. The vans ranged from mint (new) 
condition to scuzz-buckets. Then I got a Vanagon panel. It was new. It was 
white. It had fully darkened side/rear windows, front tinted and shaded. It 
was impossible to see into, even standing next to it with the window partly 
open. We have NEVER been more thank briefly questioned, the van has never 
been opened by a Customs agent, ever! (in 8 years).
        The only conclusion(s) I draw from this are:
        1) Alices Restaurant movie is used for Customs training video
        2) All customs officers are provided with silouhettes (sp?) of 
pre-80 VW vans for identification purposes.
        3) People who drive white vans don't smuggle.
        4) Customs agents are afraid of peering into dark places.

Going back across for my next load of illegal immigrants now,  and maybe a 
new 18cu.ft. fridge to boot.     tim s.(muggler!)
