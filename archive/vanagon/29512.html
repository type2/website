Subject: re: Wierd names (no vw content or PC)

The conversation around the olde turkey yesterday at the in-laws lead to a
laugh regarding a clipping from a recent newspaper (or something).
Supposedly, there is a roof repair person in the UK who named his enterprise
&quot;Titus Duxasse Roof Repairs.&quot; Probably a really old joke but funny coming
from mother-in-law, &quot;New England Marge,&quot; who has the undeserving reputation
as having her personallity described in a manner similar to the roofer's
name. She's actually pretty funny, cooks a good bird, and has a pretty neat
daughter...

&gt;&gt;BTW,  any other interesting repair shop names anyone has seen?  They seem
&gt;&gt;wierder in the back woods,   Why be normal and call it Dave's VW?
&gt;
&gt;well, my &quot;shop&quot; (non-commercial, of course) is know as
&gt;Half-Fast Shade-Tree Parts-Swappers, Ltd.
&gt;
&gt;and there is a big shade tree out back. :)
