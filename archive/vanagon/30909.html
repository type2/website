Sorry if it has been mentioned before, but in the movie &quot;Sneakers&quot;,
the origin of the fight between the protagonist and the antagonist
evolve around pizza and a very highly computerized VW van (circa 66?)

 &gt; Alright, I have seen the thread that never ends going on and
 &gt; on and on.  Now I must break down and add to the list:
 &gt; 
 &gt; Huck and the King of Hearts (1993)
 &gt; 
 &gt; A split window bus plays a central role because it spends
 &gt; the entire movie with the rear end up in the air.  Judging
 &gt; from the back-up lights (one year only on splits) it is a
 &gt; 1967.  At one point the lead is under the engine asking for
 &gt; tools.  Sitting on the rear bumper is an oil filter, so I
 &gt; guess the PPO (the worst kind, I hear) added an external
 &gt; system.
