Subject: Re: Bus Names

I named my bus &quot;Mack.&quot; After the architect Mark Mack. I did a staircase for
one of his homes in L.A. and I have been copying his style as I re-do the
interior of my 1969 Camper. Lots of color, copper sink...crazy mack would
be more like it.

1969 Camper                                 can't stanz no more.
