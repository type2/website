&gt; I'm glad GEX replaced your motor, but does that make them a good
&gt; company?  Their engine did fail after 10 months, right?  I'd rather do
&gt; business with a company that offers no warranty but who's motors last a
&gt; long time.  :)

It's a valid point, David.  The thing is, even though the shop guys 
and GEX said the motor was bad, I keep feeling like somehow I was 
negligent in my duty to my engine and it failed because of some 
shortcoming on my part in it's maintenance/upkeep.  So viewing the 
events in this light, I'm just happy to get a second chance.

I'm sure this much emotional attachment to the vehicle is 
dysfunctional.  Anyone else suffer this malady?
