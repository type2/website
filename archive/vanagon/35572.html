Subject: Three Free Hubcaps.

In the tradition of the list, I hereby offer three hubcaps free to the most
creative response.

John Sharpe was kind enough to offer his on the list.  Since I scammed those
caps (Thanks again John), I'm offering the one's I have.

They are simulated lattice alloy spoke jobs, and I mean simulated.   I guess
if you had a few beers, it was dark and accross the street you might fall
for it.  They have five simulated black lug nuts (nice touch), and a genuine
(not simulated) VW cap in the center.

There are a couple of light scratches on one cap, but no full on curb shots.
They are quite dirty.  I suppose I'll knock the loose dirt off to avoid
paying to ship it, unless someone want's a soil sample from Washington state.

I'll even ship them in John's box to avoid trashing our planet any more than
necessary.  All I ask is for someone to pay shipping.  Any takers?
