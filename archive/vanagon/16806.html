Subject: Re: `66 electrical problems!

&gt;I recently went to a wrecking yard and bought a `new' emergency light
&gt;relay for my `66. (They're ~75.00 new!) That's the stupid box that goes
&gt;under the dash that has 9 connections going to it, is a one-year-only
&gt;VW electrical thingie, and, IMHO, is a Bad Idea. 
&gt;   Anyway, I put this one in, and--nothing. Nothing at all. (My old one
&gt;worked, just smelled like it was going to cause a fire someday.) So, I
&gt;put the old one back in; now my turn signals only work when the brake
&gt;lights are on! And my brake lights work not at all. I was really careful
&gt;about making sure all the wires went back/were put on correctly. Any
&gt;insight from anyone? (I have a nice schematic of the system...hmm. Mabey
&gt;I just answered my own question.)
&gt;

More wiring, eeeewww, maybe.....the old one burned up because the wires
weren't on right.

Eug,
'71
