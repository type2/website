&gt;Howdy,

&gt;Several people have contacted me about a get-together at the Kelly Park
&gt;show in San Jose, on Sunday, April 6th.  We definitely should get together
&gt;at the show, but would anyone be interested in a Saturday night camp-out?

I would, even though I might just be overwhelmed by my feelings of
inferiority among all you listers--I'm between buses and would have to show
up in my Scooby-doo.
