&gt; very much that there are 192,000 EuroBagos floating around.

&gt; It is interesting to note that there have been close to 1,000,000 T4s built

Ric,
That 8,000 figure seems to be reasonable.  Considering I live in the LA
basin and am constantly amazed at how FEW EVs I see during my 70mile round
trip drive on the freeways every day, I would have guessed that there can't
be more than several hundred in LA and Orange Counties put together.

It's kind of comforting to know that over 1E6 have been built, even though
there aren't that many here.  Means parts will at least continue to be
available, though they might take a while to get.

My paradigm's ($0.20) worth,
