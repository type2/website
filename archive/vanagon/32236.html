Subject: Campground Membership

I have membership in the Roundout Valley Campground in Accord NY.
It is a Coast to Coast campground that offers $1 or $2 camping in 
member campgrounds.  I haven't been using it, thought the kids and 
grandkids would but they don't.  It's for sale if anybody is 
interested.
