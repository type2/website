In my perpetual search for an EV, I've come across some high mileage ones 
but the record has to be one that was at Auburn VW here in Washington State 
with 184,000 miles and they wanted (gasp) $11,000 for it! Guess the mileage 
deduction page was missing from their NADA book.

That van couldn't have spent too much time in the shop.
