Subject: VW Bus Web server



A couple days ago, I asked Joel W if he had any stored up information for a
Vanagon Web server.  He responded with over 350Kbytes of stuff!  I massaged
it lightly into a Web server at

    http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/

It ain't pretty (yet), and I could use some help proofreading and properly
formatting much of what's there (hint, hint).  Much of the stuff just has a
set of &lt;PRE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt; tags slapped around it, and I wasn't real careful about
how I separated paragraphs.  A couple of the documents are way too big and
should be split into pieces.

Joel even gets his own page. Check it out!
