Subject: Going slow in CA

	My prediction for 1996 is that the higher speed limit in
California will have no descernable effect on behavior on the road-
many people have been ignoring 55 limits their entire lives. Only 
the cop's behavior has changed-  one was once passed by CHP officers 
going 58, one is now passed by CHP officers going 68. (One goes the
limit-du-jur, naturalemont, when Le Flics are about.)

	But is *is* law in California that you must pull over and
let people behind you pass if 5 or more vehicles are behind
you. There are places (Mojave desert for example) where going 
55 or 65 will result in a huge pileup of cars behind one and
the sensible and polite thing to do is pull off and let them by.
I've done this in my Golf and wouldn't think twice about it in
the '70 single cab! I do the same on twisty, fun, roads, if I'm
driving for the view and not the instantanious angle rates.

	Happy Motoring!
