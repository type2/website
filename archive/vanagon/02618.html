 Hi,

&gt; &gt; what are a bunch of buses when they all get together?
&gt; &gt; a brick-yard? a bakery of buses? a parking lot?
&gt; 
&gt; That be a PACK I believe..

 It would dependon the style, I think:

 A fleet of microbusses
 A tray of breadloaves
 A hod of bricks (or maybe a wall of bricks)
 A community of eurovans

Cheers,
        W.
