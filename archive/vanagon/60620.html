Subject: Front End Overhaul?

I've cut the grass twice now so That means winter is finally gone. Now it's
time to gear up for maintenance. I want to overhaul the front end of our
'82 diesel vanagon. The steering has been getting a little stiffer lately
and I'm hearing some unusual noises on bumps. Nothing serious. I've heard
the upper a-arm bushings are a weak spot so I should plan on replacing
those. Any other experiences with front end repairs could be helpful. Is
Camelback the best place to get O.E. parts? I have good sources for
aftermarket parts. Thanks for the help.
Greetings from Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
