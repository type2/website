Bill Abbot confesses:
&gt;I know this sorta goes against the DIY ethos of this organization,
&gt;and it sure is a pile of money.....


Hey Bill, Don't worry about it! I just (dare I say...) put in a
VW Factory rebuilt in my 79 Bug Cabriolet...the parts manager
at the VW dealership got it for me at cost. And where my wife
is going to drive it, I want it 100% reliable.
