Subject: f/HeeHoHa (fwd)

 
These are responses to a contest sponsored by OMNI magazine:

Grand Prize Winner:
When a cat is dropped, it always lands on its feet, and
when toast is dropped, it always lands with the buttered
side facing down.  I propose to strap buttered toast to the
back of a cat; the two will hover, spinning inches above
the ground.  With a giant buttered cat array, a high-speed
monorail could easily link New York with Chicago.

Runners-up:

If an infinite number of rednecks riding in an infinite number
of pickup trucks fire an infinite number of shotgun rounds
at an infinite number of highway signs, they will eventually
produce all the worlds great literary works in Braille.

Why Yawning Is Contagious:  You yawn to equalize the
pressure on your eardrums.  This pressure change outside
your eardrums unbalances other people's ear pressures, so
they must yawn to even it out.

Communist China is technologically underdeveloped
because they have no alphabet and therefore cannot use
acronyms to communicate ideas at a faster rate.

The earth may spin faster on its axis due to deforestation.
Just as a figure skater's rate of spin increases when the
arms are brought in close to the body, the cutting of tall
trees may cause our planet to spin dangerously fast.

Honorable Mentions:

Birds take off at sunrise.  On the opposite side of the
world, they are landing at sunset.  This causes the earth to
spin on its axis.

The reason hot-rod owners raise the backs of their cars is
that it's easier to go faster when you're always going
downhill.

The quantity of consonants in the English language is
constant.  If omitted in one place, they turn up in another.
When a Bostonian &quot;pahks&quot; his &quot;cah,&quot; the lost r's migrate
southwest, causing a Texan to &quot;warsh&quot; his car and invest in
&quot;erl wells.&quot;

PLUS, as an added bonus:

Boy and his Father
------------------
A man goes into his son's room to wish him goodnight. His son is having
a nightmare - the man wakes him and asks his son if he is OK?  The son
replies he is scared because he dreamt that Auntie Susie had died.  The
father assures the son that Auntie Susie is fine and sends him to bed.
The next day, Auntie Susie dies.

One week later, the man again goes into his son's room to wish him
goodnight.  His son is having another nightmare - the man again wakes
his son.  The son this time says that he had dreamt that granddaddy had
died.  The father assures the son that granddaddy is fine and sends him
to bed. The next day, granddaddy dies.

One week later, the man again goes into his son's room to wish him
goodnight.  His son is having another nightmare - the man again wakes
his son.  The son this time says that he had dreamt that daddy had died.
The father assures the son that he is OK and sends the boy to bed.

The man goes to bed but cannot sleep because he is so terrified. The next
day, the man is scared for his life- he is sure is going to die. After
dressing he drives very cautiously to work fearful of a collision. He
doesn't eat lunch because he is scared of food poisoning.  He avoids
everyone for he is sure he will somehow be killed.  He jumps at every
noise,starts at every movement and hides under his desk.

Upon walking in his front door, he finds his wife.  &quot;Good God, Dear,&quot; he
proclaims, &quot;I've just had the worst day of my entire life!&quot;

She responds, &quot;You think your day was bad, the milkman dropped dead on 
the doorstep this morning&quot;.

PS to Kenneth:  In response to your inquiry, my bus is a 1977 *CHAMPAGNE*
edition!!
