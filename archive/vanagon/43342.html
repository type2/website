Subject: Re: Longest journey in a VW Camper


&gt;&gt;The longest journey in VW Camper was made by Harry B. Coleman and Peggy
&gt;&gt;Larson.  They completed 143,716 miles from August 20, 1976 to April 20,
&gt;1978 thrthrough 113 countries.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What about that?
&gt;
&gt;Well, on the one hand, I thought that my 10,800 mi in one month
&gt;(DC-CHI-Seattle-LA-Houston-DC) would certainly beat whatever was
&gt;behind this subject line and was gravely disappointed, OTOH, they
&gt;only averaged 7186 mi/mo so I guess I got them beat hands down
&gt;(they just have more leave than I do) :-)


Well, when I bought the V6anagon in Springfield, MO, and drove it
to Sandy Eggo in 2-1/2 days, 1600 miles, lessee, that's a rate of...
19,840 miles/month!

In fact, one 150-mile stretch between freeway gas stations was covered
at a steady 75 mph. Extrapolated out, that's... 55,800 miles per month!
Gotcha all beat!!!   heee heee heee...


What? You mean we actually have to DRIVE all these miles to get credit?
I'd have to fill the V6anagon with spare clutch parts, leaving no room
for the driver, who frankly needs a lot of room.

Awwww... never mind.   &gt;:-p

Happy Friday, all...
