Subject: Come on B.C. members, where is the Schwarzemeister



Here I am at home after a hellish day at work (1900 hrs pacific), awaiting
the GNATT caravan. Beer is cooling, chicken is roasting, the tide is in and
one could go swimming.
Did Dave make the Vancouver luncheon date!

Harry! Tobin! Christa!
