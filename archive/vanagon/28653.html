Subject: Re: To wear a bra or not to wear a bra, that is the question!

Hi All.  These bras are great, but do require lots of care.  I use 
one most of the time on the Westy but I do the following;

1.  never in rain.  If I see I am going to enter a rainstorm, I stop, 
and remove the bra from the van, and put it back in it't little 
storage bag my wife made.  

2.  I remove it everyday.  It is removed on a daily basis.  It is 
cleaned on the outside, and wisked on the inside.  The front of the 
van is also washed daily.

3.  I don't use it on daily, short trips.  Only on long trips.

4.  The front end is waxed to high heaven.  This is a great defense.

5.  The bra is also Armor-alled.  Bugs clean off very easily.

I have never had any damage to the paint on the van due these 
procedures.  It's a lot of work, but the results are good.  I have 
very little in the way of stone chips on the front of my van due to 
&quot;braless days&quot;.   I have a Colgan Bra which is very well made.

It is true that there is a significant risk of scrathing the paint 
with the bra being left on for days and days, or even washing the car 
with the bra in place.  Water trapped under the bra, and baked in the 
sun will actually  cloud the paint.

&gt;From my experience,
Harry.
&gt; &gt;      I found a wolf brand with a fleece backing for 50 dollars (cheaper 
&gt; &gt;      than other places I've called)
&gt; &gt;      
&gt; &gt;      any experience ?
&gt; 
&gt; Though my question is not directly related, I am curious to find out 
&gt; the list's conensus on bras on new cars.
&gt; 
&gt; I just bought a new Legacy wagon after the unfortunate demise of the 
&gt; old Quattro, and already have a couple of chips on the front of the 
&gt; hood.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a real problem with the plastic bug guards on cars (less so 
&gt; with the new aerodynamic ones).
&gt; 
&gt; I've heard that bras will scrath your paint as the vibrate on the 
&gt; car.  I don't know anyone personally who has one, so I've not been 
&gt; able to examine one personally.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the verdict?  Will it scratch the heck out of the car?  I wash 
&gt; the car at least once a week by hand (my personal form of 
&gt; relaxation.), and wouldn't expect too much dirt accumulation under 
&gt; there.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has _any_ suggestions, I'd love to hear.  I'm &gt; &lt; that 
&gt; close to going out and plopping down the $150 for one.  Every time I 
&gt; get near a gravel truck spewing gravel on the freeway I cringe.
