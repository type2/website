Subject: anybody know of problems with '93 EV brakes?


&gt;   My brakes on the EV are fine. Cetin, do you have ABS like I do on
&gt;   your EV? If thats the case, then there is no way they will lock.
&gt;   ABS is so much fun on the van....nothing like having some weenie
&gt;   following you and then braking late to enter onto an exit ramp!  ;-)

We do not have ABS on the EV.    I am still *very* impressed with its
braking in general, especially on snow and ice -- it is better than the '85
Audi 5000 SW, whose braking was respectable.
