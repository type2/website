Subject: hiccup data

More hiccup data here:
	Well the late winter weather here in Pittsburgh has given
me the opportunity to gather a bit more information about that 
intermittent hiccup that seems to be a problem for many Vanagons.
I am aware of the harness bandage but I really want to find the
problem instead of circumvent it.  We have been experiencing 
temperature changes in this region and I have noticed that
my 84 Vanagon will hiccup whenthe temperature is below 15 deg F.
Ant y temps above that and I don't have the problem.  
	I read an article in Electronics Now a section called
hardware hacker where a Vanagon owner had the same hiccup.  His 
journey led him to the ECU where he found that a large power
resistor on the board was loose or not soldered well.  
He repaired it and has not had the problem since.  This is also
consistent with other list members who have ventured into the
box and found &quot;cold &quot; solderd s.  
	Well would the above conditions be affected more by 
cold temperatures.  Would a connection m , that is to say, a 
poor connection, be poorer when the temperature drops.
metals shrink when they are cold.  Any thoughts or comments?
