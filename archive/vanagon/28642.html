&gt;&gt; These vehicles are part of their annual camping fleet, so they've been on
&gt;&gt; the tourist trail. One can guess that they are all gasoline, automatic and
&gt;
&gt;Owasco sets up a bunch of their fleet at the Scarborough show each year,
&gt;and I've looked inside them...  They are not *all* automatics, though
&gt;Neil is correct about the majority.
