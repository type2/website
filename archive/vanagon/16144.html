Hi Chris,
you made me curious!. i have been meaning to check out the ftp site for some 
time but have never got around to it. both kids are still in bed this AM so 
i gave it a try.
the site is:
        lenti.med.umn_dot_edu
and the directory that you want is:
        pub/halfdan/vanagon
lots of good stuff there. hope you have a fast modem

peace,
rich
