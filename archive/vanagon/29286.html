Subject: Re: TV VW Sighting

They're running an ad in Australia at the moment which features a 
squareback Type 3. It's carrying two comely young ladies who are feeling 
the heat in outback Australia. They come across a handsome young man 
working on top of a steel watertank. 

One lass climbs to the top of the tank to talk to the lad and the next thing you know he's lopping the top 
off the Type 3 with a 9&quot; angle grinder and the girls drive off in an instant 
convertible. 

I actually can't remember what was being advertised, and I saw it two 
nights ago, but I remember the details about the VW. 

There's another ad being run here which has a young couple in a mid '70s 
microbus on a long trip. Unfortunately, he should have stopped for a 
rest because he nods off and runs into the side of a semi trailer tipper. Rather scary. 


Negative effect for VWs. Some people have actually said to 
me after I bought my bus &quot;Aren't they dangerous? I saw that one on the 
ad on telly&quot; The point was, of course, that it's dangerous to drive when 
your tired, not about VWs.
