&gt;hey, no reason to weld aything.  Get the big factory manual &amp; STUDY the 
&gt;camper dismantling &amp; ?mantling? section then methodically take apart your 81

&gt;&amp; assemble the parts in &amp; on the 88.

I thought that the metal rooftops for the 88GL and the 81 Westy are different
metal roofs.  The 88GL is a single sheet of metal forming the roof and the 81
Camper is made of sheets about 2 -3&quot; apart - I think (but not sure) that
camper openings may have come from sunroof openings - hence the 2 sheets of
meta = separation to hide the sunroof.  The head room from the driver's seat
is about 2&quot; less (metal - not the plywood finish) due to the extra layer of
the roof.  What are your thoughts on this?

How do you find the strength of your new camper.  Does the body seem to be as
strong?  How did you finish off the sharp metal edges of the hole that you
cut?
