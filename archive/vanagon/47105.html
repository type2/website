&gt; Scott  Hi Scott,
  I shopped around.  The dealer said list was $84.95 plus sales tax and 
they'd have to order it.  Book store was $79.95 and if I joined their 
annual &quot;club&quot; for $10 it would be 20% off plus sales tax.  JC Whitney's 
catalog lists it for $79.95 plus shipping, and if you're a first time 
buyer, you get 10% off.  But Ron Soloman, a regular contributer to the 
list you'll often see posting, sells them for a little less.  I don't 
recall the exact price, but it's a good deal and that's what I'd suggest. 
 I bought mine from him, and prepaid it and received the Official Vanagon 
Shop Manual published by Robert Bentley publishing, affectionately called 
&quot;the Bentley,&quot; shortly thereafter.
