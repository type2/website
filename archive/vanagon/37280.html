Subject: Years of Engines

 Hi Buspeople! The customary, &quot;to the point.&quot;

 This list is DEAD! My question on 1956 Bus manuals was never answered.
Nobody knows. OK, I'll go to the next, a variation. What years cover the
1200-1500 engines? By any chance, would these be the years 1952 through 1965?

 TIA.
