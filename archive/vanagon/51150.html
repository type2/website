                   IF --
            by Junkyard Kipling

If YOU can torque your heads when all about you
   Are burning theirs and blaming someone new,
If you can trust your work when men will fault you,
   But make allowances for their failures, too;
If you can wait on parts and not be tired by waiting,
   Or being lied to, don't pay back the deal in lies;
Or when hated for your choices, never choose the Hating;
   And yet remember that not all of us are wise;

If you can plan -- and not make plans your master;
   If you can spend -- and not make money spent your aim;
If you can meet with Rust and Restoration
   And treat those two deceivers just the same;
If you can bear to see the Truths of Life bespoken
   In such ways to sell a Lie to fools,
Or watch the engine you gave your life to, broken,
   Then stoop and build it back with worn-out tools;

If you can camp with crowds and maintain your cool
   Or sing while driving -- and not be thought the Fool;
If neither dings nor faded paint can hurt you;
   If buses matter with you, but not one too much;
If you can drive the unhurried mile per minute
   In thirty seconds and still call it Fun,
Yours is the Highway of Life and all that's on it,
   And -- what's more -- you'll drive a Bus, my son!
