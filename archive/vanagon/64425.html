&gt;&gt; What are the pro's and con's of rust proofing?

when i lived in Chicago, one of the local big papers ran a series of
articles on this. their conclusion was: it ain't worth the money. :(
back then, it was Ziebart and Rusty Jones ... all fighting for the &quot;new
car&quot; market (they would NOT &quot;guarantee&quot; any car over six months old!!
oh, they'd spray the stuff on it, but they wouldn't guarantee it).

here was the gotcha: a new car, without the additional after-market
rust-proofing, would statistically last about 2.5 - 3 years before
rust began to appear. assuming &quot;normal&quot; maintenance.

WITH the additional after-market rust-proofing, the newspaper article said
the same car would statistically last about 2.5 - 3 years before rust began
to appear, assuming the same &quot;normal&quot; maintenance.

??? say what?? yup. NO difference.

the paper said the BEST thing you could do to prevent rust, especially where
salt is used on the roads in winter, is to WASH YOUR CAR regularly and often,
especially in Winter!! and wash it COMPLETELY! especially UNDER the car.
they even went so far as to recommend making a special washer wand thingie
that you drove over and it sprayed up under your car (like a lawn sprinkler).

the idea was to get as much of the salt OFF the car as quickly as possible,
dilute what was left with a lot of water, and by washing, you were expected
to LOOK at at the car and find small spots (and fix them!) before they
became large spots (of rust).

&gt;&gt; How does Rust Cehck compare to Crown rust Check?
&gt;&gt; I am concerned about health hazards since we live in the van.

i've not heard of either of these two companies, but my guess is that they
both sell &quot;services&quot; that consist of spraying some oil/wax or chemical
junk onto and into the bus, for about, oh, $500. right?

i think you'd be better off to take a couple of days vacation, get some
Naval Jelly or other rust stopper stuff, and spend those days going over
your bus, looking, checking, fixing, and painting over any rust spots you
found. and maybe put some extra coats of paint on the lower surfaces, and
especially up under the windows ... look at other cars and see where the
rust starts (from the salt accumulating), and take special care to protect
those areas.

just my opinion. :)
