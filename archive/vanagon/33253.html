I have to agree with Jim here.  I've used Synthetic in my Golf for the last
5 years (out of 7) and I've never had a leak.  My mechanics tell me the
engine compression is 'like new', after 175,000 miles on the original engine.

I'm now using synthetic on my '90 Vanagon.  No leaks after several months.
