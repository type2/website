&gt; well, I checked the valve lash... #3 exaust was dead on, intake was a

&gt; the head inside the cover, there are massive carbon (?) deposits, the 
&gt; rest of both heads are sparkling clean (these were new heads, not 
&gt; rebuilt). The deposits go from behind the spring to the adjacent head 
&gt; nut, and forward (F is F). Could this be related to the #$_at_! messed up 
&gt; heat exchanger I recently replaced? It had a fair exaust leak...

Sounds like you either have a worn-out valve guide or a crack somewhere in
the head.  There shouldn't be *any* carbon deposits under the valve cover.
