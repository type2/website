Subject:       Westy table knob/bolt

Hi Everyone.  The threads on the bolt that holds the swing out table 
in place (Vanagon Westy) finally wore out, and I thought I would post 
a solution to this problem to the list.

First off, VW wants $39.50 CDN for this knob/bolt.  The knob is made 
from plastic, and molded over a bolt.  The threads on the table top 
steel plate were also partially stripped.  The bolt is welded to the 
plate, so I just cleaned that the threads the best I could.

I have a friend who is a machinist, and he did the following;

He cut off the threaded portion of the bolt, and tapped a hole about 
a half inch deep into the barrel of the bolt.  He then took a new 
bolt, cut to length, and machined the end of that to fit inside the 
drilled out portion of the knob/bolt.  Once the two parts were 
together, he drilled a hole through the side of the bolt, and drove 
in a pin to hold the two halves together.  A little touch up on a 
grinder, and voila :)  

While I was at the dealer earlier this week, I priced out a couple 
Westy parts for fun.  These parts are in CDN $$$, and for a '90 
Westy.  The water faucet/tap is $171, and the water tank pump is 
$165.  I was thinking of getting a couple parts here and there for 
when I need them, but at these prices I don't think so.  Of course, 
if one waits too long, they won't be available.... hmmm.

Harry.
