So Matt Tooley says:
&gt; 
&gt; The only question remaining is whether to drive with the LP running the 
&gt; fridge or to run it off of 12V.  If it takes much effort to light the fridge 
&gt; once you get some where then all the cold escapes while you are trying to 
&gt; light the thing !
&gt; 

Depends on your school of thought.  If your the extra-paranoid-safety-wanna
-save-as-much-LP gas-as-I-can type like I am, I prefer to use the 12V method.  
If you're the nahhh-its-too-much-hassle-and-nothin's-gonna-happen type of 
person like Derek Drew is, then leave it on.
