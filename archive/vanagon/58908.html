I did a lot of backpacking growing up in Salt Lake City.  I was always 
impressed by the price and quality of the tents from Kirkham's (used to 
be Kirkham's Tent and Awning), and also recieved good feedback from 
friends about their products.  
Perhaps they are able to keep their prices down because they have all the 
materials and tools on-hand.  Just info, usual disclaimers :&lt;)
