Subject: Another successful Westy outing

I'm starting to realize that Richard Blier (who wrote Vancouver 
Island Adventures, etc) obviously never drove a bus... In his books
which cover the backroads of the island, he rates the roads according 
to roughness, many are suitable for only &quot;high slung 4x4&quot;..... yeah, 
right...

This weekend we successfully climbed 3000ft Mt Blenheim near Bamfield - 
this road was a 4x4 only road.... our '88 Westy had no problems, 
although it was 1st gear most of the way due to the steepness (approx 
2500' climb in 6 km with lots of loose rock.)

ps: anyone know how long the propane tank should go running just the 
fridge for approx 12-16 hrs /day? It's been about 20 days of camping 
so far...

Shawn.
