Subject: Anti-freeze &amp; phosphates

Anyone,

Reading my owners manual and my filler cap (and posts on the list) I see that
I am supposed to use only phosphate free ethyl glycol based antifreeze.  Is
the VW dealer the only place to get this or is all ethyl gylcol based
anti-freeze phosphate free????  I have been reading labels and nobody lists
&quot;phosphate&quot; as an ingredient.  The teenage Goober behind the counter hasn't
been much help.

Please reply direct: ThatVWGuy_at_AOL_dot_com
