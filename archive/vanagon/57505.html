The Governor  does not turn on any dash lights.  You probably have bad brushes 
or a bearing in the alternator.  When the Governor kicks in, you will know it 
as the engine will actually cut out.

Hi folks!

I know the van has an electronic governor that will cut the engine at a 
certain rpm . You are warned of this by the dash lights coming on. The 
problem I have is that the lights come on prematurely. For example, at 
45mph the lights will come on when I'm in 3rd gear (normally I think you 
should be able to go 55mph in 3rd gear). Oh, I have to explain the  engine 
is not cutting out prematurely at this speed; just that the lights are 
coming on. 

This is really no big deal but when the lights are on the alternator is no 
longer generating a charge voltage to  the battery. I go up some long 
grades with headlights and heater ablaze and I don't like the fact that 
everything is running off the battery.

What do you think? Is my alternator weak or is the brain going out? 

Thanks!

Steve
