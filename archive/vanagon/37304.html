&gt;Help!!  Just replaced clutch in '83 wasserboxer.  Had to resurface the 
&gt;flywheel.  Now, it appears that the clutch needs adjustment.  The only
&gt;adjustable part that is in the whole system seems to be the Master 
&gt;Cylinder push rod.  It seems to be in an almost inaccessable location.
&gt;Anyone else had this problem?  Have any solutions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks much,

If the hydraulics are correct, there is no adjustment needed.  What is the
clucth doing?  If not releasing, I suspect you have air in the system.  Blled
like you bleed brakes.  If pedal is hard, then something is mechanically
wrong or the piston in the slave is leaking and you have fluid traped on both
sides keeping it from moving.
