Subject: Re: CV Joints

I bought rebuilt axles for my GTI at a place called Berkshire CV/Axle
Express for $99 complete with CVs.  They come with a lifetime warrantee
which means if they ever wear out they're covered.  They came with new
boots and gaskets and I found there service and quality to be top notch.
Vastly better than the rebuilds I've seen at NAPA.

I have no idea how long they will last, but ANYTHING is better than
repacking CVs to me!

When I need CVs for my Vanagon, this is the route I'm going to go.

They're number is: (800) 451-5521 give them a call and quiz them on what
they do.  They ship all over the country and generally have 2 prices, one
for dealers, and one for the public.  You can usually conjole them into the
dealers price.

Let me know how they treat you.
