Subject: Hydraulic Hatch Lifts

Good Day All,

I am currently using a two section stainless steel pole
to prop up my rear hatch on the '86 Westy. Although this 
is cost effective and does provide a good exercise, I am
shopping around for hydraulic lifts. When I call the local
auto parts places I get the question, &quot;Do you want the 
lifts with variable adjust or not?&quot; Well, I don't know
which to use. Does anyone know the difference? The best
price I can get is $27.95 for lifts without variable adjust.

On a side note, on highway driving I'm getting 20mpg which 
seems pretty good to me :)
