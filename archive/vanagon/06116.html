Subject: Which muffler is best? 

I need to replace the muffler on my 71 bus and was just about 
sold on the 'Monza'/4-tip job advertised everywhere ($40-$70).  

It had the cleanest looking pipe arrangement, for one thing.  
However, salesman at local VW place pooh-poohed the system (at 
least he was honest).

Any good muffler experiences out there?

Thanks in advance...
