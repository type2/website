Subject: Syncro Convention Proposed (was: Syncro - a love story)

Syncronauts,
Jay's story below has prompted me to propose something I've thought about for
quite a while.  A &quot;Syncro Convention&quot; - sort of.  I'd like to tool around the
trails in my Syncro as Jay has done and I'd really like to do it with 3 or 4
(or 50) other Syncros. 

Each Easter four wheelers decend on Moab for the Easter Jeep Safari put on by
the Red Rock 4-Wheelers.  While &quot;Jeep&quot; is in the title, the event is open to
all 4WD vehicles.  They organize a bunch of trail runs rated from 2.5 (fairly
mild, 4WD required) to 4+ (BIG tires, LOW gears, locking differentials and
winches!).
I think this would be an ideal time for Syncronauts from all over to gather
at Moab and do some wheelin'.  I know there will be a TON of other 4-wheelers
there at this event, and that would be sort of part of the point.  I really
enjoy seeing the jaws of Jeep drivers drop when I meet theem on the trail.
 Having a whole group of us will multiply the effect and be especially fun!

I volunteer to coordinate this effort and handle the registration (yes, it's
quite organized) for the group.  This registration will need to be done in
February.

So, who's interested????

Regards,
Jim Davis

&lt;&lt; 	I just returned from a week in southern Utah and want to report on my
 baby's performance. UNBELIEVABLE! The highlight was escaping Moab, a
 pleasant but POPULAR biking/recreational hub. Down in Canyonlands area,
 I bolted through a snow-melt swollen stream 2.5+ ft. deep (I waded it
 twice and de-rocked my line) to find a Ford F-250 around the bend
 stalled due to water in his ?motor. I asked the young bucks, cause I'm
 37 now, if they needed any help but they just tried to look bored and
 said &quot;Naw&quot;.
