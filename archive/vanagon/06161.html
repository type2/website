Count me in, too, if we can get there
in a reasonable time with our camper.
What about accommodations, though? Some
campgrounds, parks, etc. are already
closed for the season. When we camped
the first 2 weeks of Sept., some places
were getting ready to close then or had
just closed (although we were north of
NJ at that time).

Maybe more campgrounds are still open
south of NJ - without looking at my
campground/state park, etc. book, I
don't know. But it sounds like a great
idea!
