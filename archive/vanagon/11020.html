Awhile back, I'd posted how I took a 3/4HP air compressor and fitted
a 7 gallon tank to it, to use for general air needs and for painting.
Tonight I tried it out &quot;for real&quot; and shot some sealer onto the bus.
Worked excellent, with both my small detail gun and my full sized 
professional gun.  The only thing I have to watch for is to not 
spray too continuously, or my pressure starts to drop.  I have a regulator
on the system, so idle time is no problem.   I had none of the 
air starvation problems I had when I painted my last bus, which I did with
this compressor, but without the tank.

Now I'm all hot and bothered to paint something!  Any guinea pigs out there?
I guestimate that with a pre-prepped car, you could take 3 hours or so
to mask it, shoot it, and then let it dry for a day (depending on the paint
system) and be done.  Mind you, on my bus I'll be using a basecoat-clearcoat
system, and painting everything inside and out and underneath!
