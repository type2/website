91 octane?!  I beg to differ!  VW engines were built to handle cheap low quality gas all around the world, like in places where they say &quot;octane?  what the hell is octane?&quot; (usually said in a foreign language :) ).  I've always run my VWs on el cheapo 87 octane gas with no problems, no pinging, etc.  Anybody that puts 91 octane in the tank of a VW is just burning money, in my opinion.  Of course, in the event that I am wrong, someone please correct me!
