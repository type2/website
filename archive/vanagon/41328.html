&gt;Boy did you guys miss a sight!  Sunday, we removed the front wheels from the
&gt;'79 by means of me standing on one side of a 2' X-wrench, holding the other,
&gt;and bouncing a bit.  Fortunately, there was a list member behind me to catch
&gt;me as I went ass over teakettle, and four more to laugh.

I did this on a gland nut but was not laughing when done.  I was almost
crying then nearly fainted.  When my breaker bar broke, I caught my knuckle
on on something and removed my little fingernail.  Not just bent back, but
entirely riped out along with a good patch of skin. This was last August
and it still hasn't healed completely

Bob Hoover had a good injury story a few weeks ago--any others?
