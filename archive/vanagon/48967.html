&gt;Hi-
&gt;
&gt;I just got a &quot;new&quot; '88 and went to change the oil yesterday and discovered 
&gt;that the drain plug was not only stripped, but they used teflon plumbing tape 
&gt;on the threads.  I have found at my FLAPS that they sell oversize drain plugs 
&gt;for many different sizes of drains.  This are slightly larger diameter with 
&gt;sef-tapping threads at the end.  I have not found the correct one for my bus 
&gt;yet, but will continue to look.  If you find one, buy two and I'll pay you 
&gt;back and vice versa.  In the meantime, I reassembled using teflon tape and 
&gt;_NO_ washer.  This allows the plug to get purchase on one or two threads that 
&gt;have yet to be mangled.  

While this may not be the reason why your threads were stripped, I'll add my
experience here anyway.  The first two oil changes I did on my Vanagon I
found that the oil drain plug was IMPOSSIBLE to remove.  I chewed up the
bolt completely trying to extract it the first time--I thought that I was
using the wrong metric wrench.  I had a mechanic pull the plug out, to be
replaced by a new one that I bought at the dealer.

This one, too, was impossible to remove.  I ended up doing a couple of oil
changes by pumping the oil directly out of the sump to avoid having to have
the plug removed again.  

It turns out that the van was sold to me without the O-ring/washer that fits
with the plug bolt--I had no way of knowing that there was supposed to be
one and didn't replace with a new one when I bought the first bolt.  When
the dealer sold me the second bolt, he asked if I needed a new O-ring to go
with it.  Thanks for not telling me the first time!

Oil plug is no longer a problem to remove.  Buy a supply at the dealer
whether you get your filters from VW or not.  The plug will hold oil without
the O-ring, but it will never come out without force.
