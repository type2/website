Subject: FS: '82 Westfalia with waterboxer conversion

     Folks-
     
     My local 99% VW wrecking yard is on the verge of selling the subject 
     vehicle - I don't have a price yet as the yard owner is out at the 
     auto auction today.
     
     At any rate, the car was originally a diesel.  The engine and tranny 
     have been replaced with an early waterboxer set.  The odometer repors 
     less than 90K miles and the body looks to be in average &quot;southwest&quot; 
     shape for the vintage.  Camper stuff is original, and I understand the 
     PO drove it in.
     
     When I get time, I'll drop by and take it for a drive and do some more 
     investigating.  The price should be more than reasonable based on my 
     past experience (bought a wreck-rebuild Golf 4 years ago).  The yard 
     is closed on the 4th and all weekend.  If you want to call, I'd 
     recommend you wait until Monday, it's 505-877-6782 (Albuquerque) and 
     talk to Ben (owner - not there today), David, or Rollie.
     
     -Blaine
