Subject:       Re: David Schwarze's site

I've downloaded this file last Friday, and had no problems with it... 
from David's site I'm sure.  What player are you using?  I used the 
MPEG player called MPEGPLAY.


&gt; The pictures all turned out well on my gif/jpg viewer, but the mpg was
&gt; impossible to watch, jumping and thrashing all about.  It was my first
&gt; time using the mpg viewer, so I don't know if it is my software or the
&gt; file. (or if it got corrupted in downloading).  Has anybody else had
&gt; any trouble with this file?  Has anybody else downloaded it?
