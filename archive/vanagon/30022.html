Hody y'all.

Well, my neighbor finally did come thru with a gas heater!

Its an Ebersparcher BA-4.  I also got a bag with various clamps and stuff,
a pull cable dohickey to asjusting the temp, and a timer jobber.

This unit looks too big to put in the engine compartment, so I was thinking
about mounting it underneath.  Any ideas, anyone?

The unit looks really good, not rust or anywhere, even in the exhaust.
Looks like it might not have been used much.

So, where do I start?  I wanna see if I can get it working on the bench
first...
