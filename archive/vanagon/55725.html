...
&gt; Black smoke on full acceleration means worn-out injection jets.
&gt; I still have the first jets in, pushing out the black smoke.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Look for signs of excessive blow-by: too much engine oil
&gt; &gt; dripping.

For *ALL* diesels:  **FIRST** check the air filter - these *must* be
kept changed &amp; clean, or they will smoke bad.

Then apply the rest of the notes mentioned on list.
