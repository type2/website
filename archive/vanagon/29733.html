Subject:       Re: '71 bus rear brake drums

I have had the same problem on a number of occasions.  I use a BIG 
hammer.  usually a five pounder.  hammer the face of the drum 
around the edges.  if you hit it hardenough the reprecussions knock 
it right off.  You must make sure you hit the drum square and solid 
so you don't deform it.  letting a little penitrating oil soak on the 
point where the pieces come together will take a lot of effort out of 
the project.
good luck.
Ed.
