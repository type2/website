Subject: Re: Hella H4 Headlights

I run a set of Marchals, nice and bright despite not being 100 watt 
versions. The white light instead of bright beige is worth every penny paid 
for them. They make high speeds in twisty roads possible at night. Good for 
spotting the odd roadkill candidate so's I don't swerve (away!, Joel) hard 
at the last minute. The mirroring is going after 8 years (on two vans), time 
to replace them. They are covered with cheap plastic bubble lenses which go 
a bit cloudy after time.
