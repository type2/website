I would like to be counted as someone else who suspects that
there is a racial element to the story. The description of
feeling righteous while vandalizing someone's car made me
very uncomfortable.

In tight parking spaces it is often unavoidable that a door
touches the adjoining car. I have gotten and given a few accidental
paint smudges over the years. In no way can I equate accidental
rubbing of paint with deliberate gouging of the side of someone's
car with a hunting knife.

The subtext of the story seemed to me to be one of &quot;getting
even with a black person with a bad attitude&quot;. That, to me,
is a racial issue.
