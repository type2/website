Subject: Commiserate with me now..

I swear to god, I am getting sick and damn tired of the bus. This morning
I get a bright and early wake up from my girlfriend. Apparently as my gf
pulled into work, smoke and yes, a few small flames, appeared under the
freshly rebuilt engine. Oil everywhere. She grabs an extinguisher and puts
it out, averting any damage to the bus. While she was OK (which is the big
thing), she was quite understandably shook up. I go look at this mess a
little later. Here's the symptoms - 

Ran *damn* hot
Oil puddle that would make the Valdez envious

Guess what happened?? I pop the back hatch. The fan looked a little
cockeyed in the housing (73 type 4 engine). I go to push it on, and the
(*&amp;(*&amp; thing comes off in my hands!!!! The bracket it bolts to wasn't
bolted to the crankshaft and trashed the front seal. All in all, the probs
bark was worse then it's bite. Apparently the fit of the bracket on the
crank was so tight the previous owner (po) didn't realize that it needed
one!! And silly Jamie didn't go looking for missing bolts!! Aghhhh..

I need a drink.

Jamie
