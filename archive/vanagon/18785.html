Subject: Vanagons and Insurance

 I just got a suprise yesterday while looking over my auto insurance policy
renewal.The amount of money I am billed for medical and personal injury
protection is the same for 3 of my cars (65 VW Notchback, 85 Chevy Cavalier, 85
Plym.Station Wagon), and different on the my 88 Vanagon!

Now hold on, don't get too upset...

Curious about the difference, I started to read the fine print. It seems that
the Vanagon receives a &quot;Vehicle Injury Rating Discount&quot; of $7.81!! This may not
seem like much, until you realize that the coverage without the discount is only
$20.08 for 6-months. Seems that the Vanagon gets a whopping 30% (approx)
discount!!!!  Thats right, my insurance company (USAA) rates my Vanagon safer
than any of my other &quot;normal&quot; cars! WOW! Who would'a thunk it?

Any similar experiences out there?
