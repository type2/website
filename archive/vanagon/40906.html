     &gt; There seems to be some question about whether bullets existed in the 
     &gt; 1961 model year.
     &gt;
     &gt; Tom F mentioned that the number 672483 would be later than '60 -    
     &gt; according to the NEATO data at                                      
     &gt; http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/chassis.html
     &gt;
     &gt; He also cited a source for the change over date from bullets as:
     &gt;http://killer-whale.automatrix_dot_com:80/~skip/volkswagen/early-diffs.ht
     &gt;ml
     
     my '60 single cab has bullets,
     
     Lee.
