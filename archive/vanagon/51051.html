&gt;The easiest way to check your coil is to replace it. If you have access
&gt;to a VOM let me know and we can do it the hard way.
&gt;Good luck

Hi,
        Just checked a catalog, they want $56 for a coil (83-85 Vanagon),
you can get an acceptable meter for around $50(?) or less. 
        If you buy the tool (meter) you can check coils for the rest of your
life, as well as elect motors, trouble shoot all kinds of problems, see if
light bulbs are good and so on. 
        Makes sense to get the meter, if you can't afford the meter how are
you going to afford to shotgun troubleshoot a vw?
        If all else fails you can check the coil like St Muir taught me, by
the color of the spark.
        Good luck. 

Rob
