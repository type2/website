So Kedar Warriner says:
&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to this list because I want to buy a VW Westfalia soon.  I have
&gt; a friend in Swizerland who has one.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions about what to look for and what to avoid
&gt; when I'm looking for one?  
&gt; 

Sure, I'll send you a copy of the Bus Summary in private email or
you can see it at this web site:
