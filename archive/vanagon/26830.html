Subject: Blessed silence

Like some others who have posted here, I had a &quot;squeak-squawk&quot; in my 81
Vgon's front suspension.  I bought new A-arm bushings from Busboys and
put them in this weekend.  First time in all the thousands of miles I've
put on the van that I've been able to drive over the slightest bump without
a squawk.  

Getting the bushings out and back in without a press is a challenge, but I
thought of Bob and refused to give in.  My word of advice for others who
attempt it is: SCREW.

That is, use screws rather than impact.  I got both bushings out with a 
hammer and some heat, but the heat slagged the plastic in the bushings so
I knew that wouldn't do for getting the new ones in.  I cobbled up a fixture
from a spring compressor and big sockets and screwed each bushing in smooth
as silk.  From the amount of difficulty, I am skeptical that the tack-weld
you're supposed to do is really necessary to hold them in place, but I'll
let you know.

While I Was In There I replaced the upper ball joint as it had a bad boot
although it still felt pretty tight.

In a sense the bushings were a cosmetic item, because I have no evidence that
the van handled any differently due to the squeak, but it affected the very
first impressions of every person who ever rode in the van, so I'm glad I
did it.  Just remember, if you do it, screw.
