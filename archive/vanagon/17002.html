&gt;  OFFICE MEMO          Gasket Sealant Question                Date:5/5/95
&gt;
&gt;I'm ready to put the coolant flanges back on my '85 vanagon after putting the
&gt;head back on, but am unsure of what to use for gasket sealant.

I did mine a la Bentley for '85, no goop. Held fine (3yrs) but I didn't like 
doing it. My current '87 has been done once and black goop is apparent, on 
gaskets and trans/motor joint. I don't know what the product was. Until you 
get 'real' advice.... I use Loctite and/or Permatex brands of silicone goop, 
hi-temp versions, for water pumps, heater flanges etc. Is the dealer stuff 
really too expensive, considering the parts/labour so far AND the potential 
effects of a failed job?
