Subject: ? poptop storage

Learned Volks-  Just before closing the poptop, I put my sleeping bag behind
the folded top bunk.  Although crushable, I couldn't distribute it evenly in
the space available.  The top latched shut with no problem, but despite it
being logical bag storage (so I &quot;don't leave home without one&quot;) am I taking a
chance of straining the hinges/top/mattress?
