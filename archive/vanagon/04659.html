&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Lee Ann (borrowing my boyfriends E-Mail account).

----------Stuffed clipped here&gt; 

&gt; We are also planning to buy an Eagle Pass to National Parks. Has anyone 
&gt; done this?  Is it worth it, or is it best to just play it by ear?
&gt;

&gt; 
By all means by the Nat'l Parks pass for $25. Each Nat'l Park is $5, so you
break even at five; but the Nat'l Monuments now become free, and there are
tons of them. It's a great deal.

Neil Wigley
