Howdy,

	Haven't had much time to give any updates lately, so here goes:

	Been working on the &quot;major&quot; bodywork pieces.  Attempted to de-rust 
front floor section, looks like I need to break down and get new pieces
to weld in (Mary &amp; Clay, are you listening?) 

	Other dents include the big sidelong scrape down the passenger side,
especially over the wheels.  

	Shot some PPG DAC Acrilic Primer/Sealer over the whole bus as a means to test
my new compressor - 

	Oh yeah, I bought a new 4HP 20Gal compressor!

	Bought some PPG Prima filler primer, which I find out now you're not
s'posed to shooton top of the DAC stuff, oh well, sand the DAC off I guess.
This Prima stuff is a 3 part filling primer/surfacer/sealer.  There's the
Prima; Reducer, and Hardener.  You can it thin for a sealer, or thick
for a filling primer.  Whats cool about it is that it can be tinted, so
you can &quot;pre-color&quot; th vehicle with the primer!

	I started work on the nose last night, some hammer and dolly work
to straighten it out a bit more, and started the finish work.

	Once the weather warms up, I'm going to strip the bus, and then do the
final detail body work, and then paint.  Maybe late April?  For the time
being I'm going to try to get the heavy bodywork done - welding the rest of
the battery area, front floor pans, and closing up the unnecesary taillight 
holes.

	I am also trying to decide on color.  I was thinking yellow, like the
panel a few months back on the cover of VWT or HVW's, but then again I 
wanted to paint the 911 that color.  Would be dorky to have 2 cars the
same color?

	I need to play with the brakes some more, too.  The moaning is still
there, and the pedal is real low.

	Until next time...

Thom
