Subject: 71 Bus: Lola needs her steering wheel removed, please help!

To those of you who saw my listserv question, sorry about that! As I
explained to busgirl, I thought we were having  a moment of silence about
some sort of loss in the family or something...

Anyway,

I'm trying to replace the turnsignal switch and I'm having an awful time
removing the steering wheel...the Berkley manual shows this lovely photo of
a steering wheel puller...but of course, I can't find the correct type
anywhere...

I called Austin VeeDub and was told that I just have to wrestle with it...
Well, I'm not a member of the WWF and it's not going that great.. in fact,
I haven't made a budge....

Any suggestions would help...


Thanks in advance!

J89
