Subject: Bus Event this weekend at Stone Mt.


I got a flyer a couple of weeks ago about a bus gathering at Stone 
Mountain State Park campground in Georgia this weekend, March 9-10.

It's called 'Grateful Buses' or something like that.  So if you miss 
the Spring Tour since Jerry's dead, this might be fun for you.

I have nothing to do with this event and only know info that is on the 
flyer I received.  For more info you can call Todd at (770) 971-6383 
(or I can give you more info from the flyer if you want).

If I go, I will be there late Saturday night as I will be flying back 
from Memphis Saturday afternoon.

Dave
