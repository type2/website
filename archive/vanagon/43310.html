Subject: Re: Longest journey in a VW Camper

&gt; Hi all!
&gt; The longest journey in VW Camper was made by Harry B. Coleman and Peggy
&gt;Larson.  They completed 143,716 miles from August 20, 1976 to April 20,
1978 thrthrough 113 countries.
&gt;
&gt;What about that?

Well, on the one hand, I thought that my 10,800 mi in one month
(DC-CHI-Seattle-LA-Houston-DC) would certainly beat whatever was behind this
subject line and was gravely disappointed, OTOH, they only averaged 7186
mi/mo so I guess I got them beat hands down (they just have more leave than
I do) :-)
