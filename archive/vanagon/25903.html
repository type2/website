Use the clear vinyl available at ``lumber yard department stores'';
places like Home Depot.  It's not optically clear, but it's good
enough that you can tell when something's coming up behind you.
Admittedly, backing up is still best done with side mirrors.

It's kind of expensive if you buy an entire roll and have no other use
for the stuff (around thirty or forty bucks), but you only need about
seven feet for a bus (YMMV, measure first), and sometimes you can
convince them to sell you just what you need.
