Subject: 1700 cc engine questions...

I've got a line on a 72 camper that has a beat up interior, straight,
relatively rust-free body, and a 1700 cc engine with a single Weber
carburetor.  I haven't looked at it with analytic eye yet, only a cursory
examination, and I'm wondering about the 1700, and if the bus is worth
pursuing. Is the extra 100 cc's worth the extra cost of repair?  Are there
any foibles unique to that engine?  Any warnings or advice about the
engine?  Thanks for your help...
