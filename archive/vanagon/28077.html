Subject: Re: PartsPlace catalog Offer (repost from rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled)


&gt; We (The Parts Place for all Volkswagens) are offering free catalogs 
to VW
&gt; enthusists on the internet.  We are the largest new and used 
Volkswagen parts
&gt; dealer east of the Rocky Mountians.  


I just gotta put my two cents about The Parts Place.

In July I got a catalog from them, which got me VERY excited.  Seemed 
that they had ALL of the parts that I needed to finish off my '70 
Westy. I called them, and attempted to place my order.

The catalog showed used rear bumper brackets for my Bus for $9.95.  I 
wanted two.  &quot;Sorry&quot; I was told, &quot;the price on those is $19.95.&quot;  I 
directed the salesman to the page, and catalog number of the item. &quot;OK&quot; 
he said, &quot;$9.95 it is then.&quot;  Next I ordered two rear marker lights, 
and a dashboard idiot light for the brakes.  I was told that they had 
these all of these in stock.  I gave him my credit card number, and 
waited patiently

During this time we were to be off on vacation.  Upon my return I 
looked anxiously for my package, only to find a post card saying that 
NONE of the items I had ordered were available.  Needless to say, I am 
not too thrilled with &quot;The Parts Place.&quot;
