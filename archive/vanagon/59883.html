Subject: Re: change list to newsgroup?

Please, Please, please. Could we stop this discussion? Changing the list into
a newsgroup is not on the ballot.  It's not being talked about or thought
about by the people who are actually doing this. 

Thanks for all your opinions, but it's not appropriate at this time.
