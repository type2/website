Subject: Re: 1000 miles and counting

&gt;Hi volks--I just wanted to tell you all that I have logged
&gt;exactly 1000 miles in my bus since I got it this summer.
&gt;I just love driving it around, can't really describe it
&gt;but you all know what I mean   :-)

Second that, from another newbee!  Was depressing to be without Felix, my
Westy, during new engine replacement.  Turned over 1000 mi. last night, and
enjoying life again.  Guess ya gotta love it, to go through 7 previous
engines.

On the way home I was passed by a blonde female in a Camaro, with license
DNCD4IT.  What could it mean?  }8-{)&gt;  No lie.
