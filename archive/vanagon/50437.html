&gt;Subject: Vanagon/Motor Home Insurance

&gt;I called my insurance co (Met Life) to see if I could save money insuring my
&gt;85 Westy as a motor home. The first question they asked is what did it cost
&gt;new in 85.
&gt;Does anyone have that number?
&gt;Thanks,


YEP!  I have the window sticker from my GL (GREAT previous owners!).
I am not home but it was about $18,000 US.  plmk what they
say about insurance.
