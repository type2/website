Subject: Re: What's up with the list?

&gt;What 'fringe'?  I always thought I was firmly ensconced in the heart of VW
&gt;wondervanland. With the best of both worlds.  A solid, workable air-cooled
&gt;engine in a big, roomy Vanagon camper.  

&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;  Don Geiger                        &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;

Actually, Don, I'm afraid you don't really qualify for either list!

Since you don't have to deal with the plumbing-related problems of the
waterboxers (head gaskets, waterpumps, etc.), nor do you need to deal with
the spontaneous degeneration of parts (e.g., front axle beam, etc.) of the
breadloaves, you apparently have no problems, and therefor have no need to
be on either list.

However, I would be willing to recommend that you be awarded honorary
membership to both lists, since apparently you do not have to spend most of
your spare time repairing your vehicle, as would a &quot;true&quot; list member.
Since &quot;idle hands are the Devil's tool,&quot; it may be incumbant on the
membership of the two lists to provide you with sufficient reading material
to keep you from the path to perdition, if only for our own protection. ;)
