FYI only.

&gt;
&gt;Hey Randy (and Chris and others),
&gt;
&gt;        Had my first welding class in two weeks and I got some info
&gt;on books:
&gt;
&gt;        Welding Skills &amp; Practices
&gt;                ISBN:  0-8269-3044-1
&gt;
&gt;        The Procedure Hand Book of Arc Welding (12th ed)
&gt;
&gt;                Published by
&gt;                Licoln Electric Company
&gt;                22801 St Clair Avenue
&gt;                Cleveland Ohio 44117
&gt;
&gt;        Welding Priciples &amp; Applications
&gt;                ISBN 0-8273-1806-5
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My instructor called the Licoln book the 'bible' of welding.  Covers
&gt;arc welding in detail - which gives the needed background for just
&gt;about any type of welding.....
&gt;
&gt;        The other two books he said good, class room text type things.
&gt;Personally, I didn't get to leaf thru them too much since he turned
&gt;us loose on the Oxy-Fuel and Arc welders early..... So I can't comment
&gt;to much on their content.  From a casual glance, all 3 seemed to be
&gt;packed with info.  The Lincoln seemed to be &quot;Ok you know the very basics
&gt;now here is the rest&quot;.  The others seemed to be &quot;here are the basics through
&gt;intermediate stuff&quot;.
