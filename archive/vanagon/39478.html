Subject: replacing brake lines
Date: Wed, 10 Apr 1996 10:06:16 -0700

I need to replace a corroded section of brake line and while I'm at it 
change the brake fluid. I haven't done this before, so I'd like to get a 
little advice first to avoid any potential pitfalls. Seems pretty 
straight-forward though.

How do I drain the brake lines? One wheel at a time through bleeder valves?

Then how do I refill and bleed the air out of the system?

Anything else I should know?

Thanks,
Mark McCulley
