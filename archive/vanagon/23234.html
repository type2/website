Subject: another late intro

Begging your pardons for the lack of courtesy.
Hi. I'm known as Ed Frank, 43 year old computer geek. Live in Farmington, 
ME, work in administrative computing at the U of Maine at Farmington. Of the 
6 busses I've owned, all were (are) my favorites. In sane moments I wonder 
why VW continues to ask so much of bus owners, but then there's that perfect 
trip.... Thanks for inviting me into your list, and thanks, belatedly, to 
the kind folks who've helped with some of my questions.
