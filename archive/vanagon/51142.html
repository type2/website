&gt; 
&gt;                               Only in Arkansas
&gt; 
&gt;              Here's more on why Arkansas is everyone's favorite
&gt;            state. This is from the Arkansas Democrat Gazette:
&gt;              &quot;Two local men were seriously injured when their
&gt;            pickup truck left the road and hit a tree near Cotton
&gt;            Plant on State Highway 38 early Monday morning ...
&gt;              &quot;Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc, and Billy Ray
&gt;            Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious
&gt;            condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident
&gt;            occurred as the two men were returning to Des Arc
&gt;            after a frog-gigging trip. [Note to city slickers:
&gt;            frog-gigging, or frog-sticking, is how, armed with a
&gt;            small pitchfork, you catch frogs from the bayou bank.
&gt;            Frog legs make a tasty supper.]
&gt;              &quot;On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pickup truck
&gt;            headlights malfunctioned. The two men concluded that
&gt;            the headlight fuse on the older-model truck had
&gt;            burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available,
&gt;            Wallis noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his
&gt;            pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the
&gt;            steering wheel column. Upon inserting the bullet, the
&gt;            headlights again began to operate and the two men
&gt;            proceeded on eastbound toward the White River Bridge.
&gt;              &quot;After traveling approximately 20 miles and just
&gt;            before crossing the river, the bullet apparently
&gt;            overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right
&gt;            testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply to the right,
&gt;            exiting the pavement and striking the tree. Poole
&gt;            suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the
&gt;            accident, but will require surgery to repair the
&gt;            other wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and
&gt;            was treated and released.
&gt;              &quot;'Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston
&gt;            shot his nuts off or we might have been dead,' said
&gt;            Wallis.
&gt;              &quot;'I've been a trooper for 10 years in this part of
&gt;            the world,' said Deputy Snyder, 'but this is a first
&gt;            for me. I can't believe that those two would admit
&gt;            how the accident happened.'
&gt;              &quot;Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's
&gt;            wife, asked how many frogs the boys had caught, and
&gt;            did anyone think to get them from the truck.&quot;
