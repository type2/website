Subject: Strange buses

I have just spent all morning in the library wading through old journals in 
the name of research. As I casually leafed through a Feb 1956 issue of 
Automobile engineer, (I know, not exactly the most widely read mag) a 
cut-away picture of a bus caught my eye and work came to dead stop. Anyway 
it was all about multi purpose,  light commercial vehicles and had a 
description of the improvements made to the 'new' VW as well as the Fiat 
Multipla and a few others. But what made me take notice were the photos of a 
Alfa Romeo microbus with 24 windows (similar to a 23 window but with a one 
piece front screen and two extra roof windows above it). There was also a 
DKW in kombi, panel van and pick-up versions and a Goliath 22 window sunroof 
bus, again remarkably similar to a VW but with a curved front window. I wish 
I could scan these for you all to have a look at.
