Subject: Replace FI with carb??

I am considering replacing the fuel injection system on my '81 Westie with
a weber carb kit that is sold for this purpose.  I am told this eliminates
the conputer, injectors, air flow meter, idle stabilizer, and a few other
parts.

I am thinking of doing this because I need new injectors, and because of
MUCH greater familiarity with carburated engines.

The question is:  Am I having an MIA (momentary idiot attack)?  What are
the reasons not to do this?  Has anybody else done this?  What results?

Thanks,

Bill
