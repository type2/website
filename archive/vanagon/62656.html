How do i get on your mailing list?

I have a 1980 Vanagon in good condition (shiny paint)-- how much is it worth?

Where can i get a catalog of 1994 Westfalia accessories?

Will Volkswagen dealers service my Dometic referigerator or should i go to a
R.V. center?

Thanks in advance for any info you can provide.

Eric Sorensen
