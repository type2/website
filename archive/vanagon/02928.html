Subject: Early (real early) turn signals

Hey,

	Does anyone know how the early turn signals are s'posed to work?
I didn't see any relay (or anything that looked like one)  in that mess
of spaghetti that passes for my wiring, but when I was debugging my 
talights today, I couldn't figure out why one filament was blinking, (duh)
the turn signal switch was on.  The left one works but not the right
one!  I don't hear the traditional clinking of the relay or anything
to tell me what actually makes it blink.   Its also a different cadence
of blink than I've seen before, more of a pulse than a blink..
...ITS ALIVE!

	Its getting more and more interesting as this project progresses!
