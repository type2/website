     I'd be interested in hear your .02 cents about the .50 cent fix - 
     sounds like a bargin !

&gt; This does not just affect syncros, but all later vanagons with
&gt; digifant fuel injection. The VW recommended correction is a $100 
&gt; wiring harness. 
     
I've also got some instructions for the $.50 version of this fix if 
anyone is interested (requires capacitor, soldering iron and 
heatshrink.)
