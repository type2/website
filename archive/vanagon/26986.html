Washington DC beltway - I 495.

Weirder situation was I95 in Northern Virgina had no truck is RIGHT 
lane.  Construction of new lanes was going on and the right lane was the 
former shoulder.  After a guy got killed when his car broke down with no 
shoulder they modified the law to prohibit trucks in that lane.
