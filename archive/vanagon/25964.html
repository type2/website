&gt;&gt;heating an RV while it is parked (and not plugged in).  Does anyone know
&gt;&gt;where you can get a good *vented* propane heater (catlytic?) for under a
&gt;&gt;hundred bucks?  That's what I want.
&gt;
&gt;maybe we're going at this wrong ... let's look at it from a slightly
&gt;different perspective:
&gt;
&gt;what other people/machines/lifestyles/recreation require similar heat? and
&gt;what do they do about it?
&gt;
&gt;example:

&gt;- ice fishing:
&gt;    how do you heat those little shacks out on the ice?

I tried ice fishing once. The shack was heated with a coffee can heater. A
roll of toilette paper was placed in a tin coffee can, fill with rubbing
alchohol, and light. You put it out with the lid. Seemed to burn cleanly
and for a long time. Perhaps you could rig up an enlarged  'commuter cup'
version of this for a bus? You could use it as a cig lighter too.
