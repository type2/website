RE: DORMOBILES

maybe the brits would be better able to comment on Martin Walker (i.e.
Dormobiles), but I beleive Dormobiles were also kitted out on British
marques as well. So to answer your question, i don't think the term
Dormobile would be unique to VW's.

BTW I prefer refeering to campers made by VW as &quot;Westfalia's&quot;, if in fact
they were in fact made by Westfalia Werke. Campmobile sounds like a cheesy
salesman's pitch. Can you imagine shelling out 38K (the going price for the
new Eurovans) for a vehicle called a &quot;campmobile&quot;? It sounds like the sort
of thing that the Partridge family would drive in! The only thing they
could do to make the name worse would be to call it a &quot;Kampmobile&quot; IMHO!

 pass the aeresol cheese spread please :) :)
