4) head gasket gone, head cracked, coolant runs to ground like beautiful 
waterfall on Moccassin creek, overflow tank is empty...as a matter of 
fact so is the main tank.


&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In all cases overheating/air buubles eventually occur. #3 happens as the 
&gt; &gt;engine cools, leads to short period of rough idle on start-up. This was sent 
&gt; &gt;a while back by another poster. As it gets really cold it sucks in from the 
&gt; &gt;overflow?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Are there any more modes/combos for head/coolant failures, are the ones 
&gt; &gt;above really true? My '87 has already drunk a jug of Autobahn (in 2 months), 
&gt; &gt;without leaving a trace so I'm assuming #3 is at play.  tim s.
&gt; 
&gt; not to deviate from your topic too much, but i was curious, what is 
&gt; observable on the engine which would indicate problems with the head 
&gt; gasket/cooling system? TIA

see above ; )
