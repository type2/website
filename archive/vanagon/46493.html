Subject: VINTAGVW: an air-cooled only list

For those who are intrested there is a list that is for air-cooled only
VW's.  Here is the subscription information:

VINTAGVW has been created as a forum for owners/enthusiasts of air-cooled
Volkswagens to exchange information about the care and maintenance of
older model VWs.

VINTAGVW runs as a LISTSERV list at San Jose State University. LISTSERV is
an automated mail-distribution system, developed by Eric Thomas at the
University of Paris. Some of the features of LISTSERV are:

Automated Registration

LISTSERV eases the onerous task of maintaining subscriber information.
Members may sign onto or off the list at will. For example, If you want to
subscribe to the list , send a SUBSCRIBE request to
listserv_at_sjsuvm1.sjsu_dot_edu with a SIGNOFF command in the text of the
message (you may leave the Subject line blank):

SUBSCRIBE VINTAGVW yourfirstname yourlastname

I got this info from:
http://www.oroad_dot_com/volkswebbin/faqs/baginfo.html#4.

So the questions that comes to mind are, why split this list to make a
list that is air-cooled only?  Is there anyone else that can host a
combined list?  Would a newsgroup reduce the work for any specfic host?


	Good Luck.
