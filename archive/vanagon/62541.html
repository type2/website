Subject: Insulation for busses/vans

Hi all,

i saw a recent thread on the vanagon list where someone had removed his
headliner and wanted to know what to use for insulation up there. Since i
didnt see any responses i thought i'd crosspost this to both lists.

i am in a similar situation, i have a 71 bus that the headliner burnt out
of, and all the insulation burned as well.  So... i am going to be using
something other than the factory stuff to get better insulation and sound
deadening properties.

My idea was to buy that foam carpet padding stuff (looks like chopped bits
of foam glued together) hopefully in about a 1 inch thickness.  I figured
that this would work well, fit, and be much less expensive than the kind
of heat resistant stuff that most car places sell.  (since itll be behind
the headliner in the passenger compartment it wont need the oil and heat
resistance of something that would go in the engine compartment...)

any opinions on this idea?  Any other better ideas out there?

thanks,

Steve
