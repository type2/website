Subject: Re: Carat dash clock source?

&gt; My newly-purchased '91 Carat has a digital dash clock, which is fine,
&gt; but which is set to the wrong time, which is less fine.  Unfortunately,
&gt; the two little buttons on either side of it do nothing.  Asked the VW
&gt; dealer to check it out while doing other things, and he said it'd just
&gt; have to be replaced - for $251.  I don't think so.  Anyone have a
&gt; cheaper source for new/used ones?  I know I could replace it with a
&gt; stick-on clock for $1.00, but the Carat's still got that new feel (to
&gt; me, anyway) and I'd like to keep it stock for a while.  (It's
&gt; back-lighted, too, which I like.)

Buttons?  Mine has holes, and you use a straightened paperclip to stick in
there to change the time.  The hole is smaller than most ball-pens these
days.  Rather than disconnecting the battery, you can just unplug the
connector at the bottom of the instrument pod -- and thus not affecting your
radio.  But my clock keeps time even when unplugged, so you have to leave
it unplugged for a while -- I suspect there's a capacitor in there that
holds a charge so you don't lose the time easily.

If the &quot;holes&quot; *really* don't work, disassemble the clock from the dash pod 
and clean the contacts.  There are no moving parts in the clock -- if it 
keeps time now, it is probably fine.
