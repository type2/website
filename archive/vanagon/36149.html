&gt;Ummm.... In my dictionary 'permanent' means to last 'indefinately' without
&gt;change.  Does VW use a different dictionary or is this 'newspeak'?

The automobile industry refers to permanent antifreeze as the all season type
that rplaces alcohol.  I have an antique car,(1923 HAYNES) whose owners
manual recomends filling the cooling system with Karosene for winter
operation.  They also warn you not to boil the system!!!  Fire hazard or
something to that effect.
