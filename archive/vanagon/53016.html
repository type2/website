Subject: Silicon oil in Syncros viscous coupling


Hello Guys,

As I wrote in my last mail, a lot of Syncroists in the Club are very
interested in how to get theirs Syncros fixed because as they get olders
(the vans, not the owners...), some of them have viscous coupling problems
and, of course, turbo diesel engines. And as you surely know, the VW dealers
prices for parts and repairs are fairly expensive in our country.

So that's why we would be very interested in finding correspondants in
Germany for all these kinds of problems.

Maybe you'll be able to help me out about a question :

Viscous coupling : They are built in a company called Visco Drive, but I'm
not sure whether it's in Germany or Austria. The fact is, when they break,
it's usually only a matter of silicon oil, they are OK mechanically, but the
company doesn't want to tell which kind of oil it is. Just go to the VW
dealer and get a new visco for about $3100 in France. Kind of expensive
oil... Any idea about this? If we'd know about this oil, problems would be
fixed. Only need to remove one screw, change the old oil and that's it! How
do we found out about this? One of the Club's member got one from a wreck
and put it on his Syncro. After that he opened the old one, everything,
discs included was OK except the oil. It seemed that there was a kind of
rusty greasy liquid instead of clean silicon. If someone knows exactly about
this oil caracteristics, it'll be very helpful for all Syncro's addicts and
save big bucks!! We're still working on it.

Thanks,
