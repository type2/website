Subject: Vacuum leaks?  '85 camper

I am having a heck of a time setting up my engine.  If I set the 
timing to specs (5 ATDC), the engine barely runs and will try to 
stall after revving it.  It will run fine above 2000 rpm but will 
cycle from approx 400 - 1000 rpm at idle.  The Hall unit checks out 
okay, fuel pressure and flow volumeseems good, but I think that the 
vacuum unit is not doing its job.  Vacuum seems low at the fuel 
pressure regulator unless above 2000 rpm.  

Any tips or advice from anyone (besides my wife's &quot;Blow it up!&quot;), 
would be appreciated.
