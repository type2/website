Subject: rust on a longblock oops shortblock and more

I've gotten a complete engine; a short block, two heads, 2 f.i. systems,
2 intake manifolds, 2 complete set of gaskets, and more.  I have yet to
put on the head. The problem is that some rust has started on the top
and has edged down into a cylinder, not much and not very far.

What is the best way to deal with this stuff?  I dont want to make it
any worse.

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.
