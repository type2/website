Subject: June Bug Jamboree Scores

Hi All,

Hats off to Bob Hufford and gang in Springfield, Mo for an excellent 2nd 
Annual June Bug Jamboree!  An amazing amount of Bob's Buses made it to 
the show--right into the swap meet!  There were lotsa quality VW's there 
shining in the summer sun.  Buses by Route 66 was also a success.

I did manage to pick up a few goodies.  One item I managed to purchase 
was a Hazet Tourist toolkit, minus most of the tools.  I never imagined 
I'd even find one, so I am still quite excited about it.  Let's just say 
it's a keeper.  Other items include a pair of glass bus taillight 
assemblies, a chrome Splittie Type II gas door/engine hatch key (1st 
chrome one I'd ever seen), and a deluxe bus mirror.  There was an 
interesting 59 Deluxe Sunroof bus and 64? Bug convert.  Both were very 
rough, but very original.  Anyhoot, thanks again to GROOVEN for a great 
show and Bob Hufford for the BBrt66 Campout!  8-)
