Subject: ignition problems

Hi, my 85 Westie has a problem starting after being driven long 
distances. I took a trip to Atlanta last weekend and everything was 
fine on the way down, on the way back, however, I stopped at a rest 
area and was unable to restart...nothing, no turnover whatsoever. 
After waiting about 15-20 minutes it started right back up. Down the 
road a ways further I stopped for gas and had the same problem. Only 
this time it would not start after 45 minutes...nothing...so I called 
my mechanic bach home and he suggested getting a jump because 
sometimes the additional voltage can make a difference...well this 
worked and I was back on my way...The cause is still a mystery 
tho...any suggestions? Thanks for any advice,
Rick
