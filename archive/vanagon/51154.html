Subject: OIL API bulletin on www

Hi Everyone.  Chris Longhurst has been kind enough to post the API 
service bulletin from Castrol oil on the web at the following 
address:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/2195/castrol.html

Chris was instrumental in my research on this, and was also very kind 
to post the bulletin.  He has an excellent page on auto related 
topics.

Harry.
