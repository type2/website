Subject: Re: Kelly Park Show - April 9th

&gt;&gt;About 7 years ago I attended the first SOTO meet down at Deer Park in San
&gt;&gt;Diego.  There were these 3 guys from Sacramento, everyone knew who they were
&gt;&gt;and knew that they were involved in stealing off of other's cars.  Soon
&gt;&gt;enough, parts that were being sold in their swap spot turned out to be
&gt;&gt;stolen parts. They were literally dragged and kicked out of the park.
&gt;&gt;Sacramento still has that reputation.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, I know _exactly_ who it is you are talking about!  I think
&gt;its the same guy that tried to take my bus, and took the one down the street.
&gt;Its actually a group of about 8 guys, with 2 guys as the &quot;ringleaders&quot;
&gt;and a bunch of others that grip parts for them.
&gt;

This is the reason that I paid the extra $ to &quot;enter&quot; my nasty-looking '57
single cab in the VW Classic last summer. We were told to park right next to
the Charlie-mobile that took best TypeII (what a hoot). We felt like Uncle
Jed and Granny visits Models Inc.! VW T&amp;A reviewed the show and mentioned
that the vintage side of the show was nice except for occasional &quot;piles of
puke&quot;. Although the single is light years away from one of Charlie's
concourse projects, the single was also light years away from the parking
lot thieves.
