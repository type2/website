Subject: Hey, a Minivan Westy!

Standing outside the other day for one of those &quot;smoke breaks&quot; (yeah, I
know, I know) I saw what I thought was a D*dge Minivan with a poptop roof.
I thought, &quot;Hey man, I didn't know that Chry*tler Corp made a camper! Wow.&quot;
The minivan made the turn and then I saw the familiar logo. Er, oops,
nevermind. I guess the shape of the '96s have changed a bit. Sorry for the
flamebait.
