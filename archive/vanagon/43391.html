re 25 hp moter for sale

        Here's one for Clara, Thom and other barndoor owners.
        I just spotted an advertisement in the swedish magazine Classic
Motor Magasin. The add describes it as a &quot;reservkraftmotor (industrial
motor) with only 100 hours usage. Sounds a bit to good to be true. Anyway,
the phone number is Sweden (in Ronneby) 70-8136891 and ask for Ingvar.
