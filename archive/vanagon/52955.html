Subject: Neat Toy for EV (or Vanagons...)


My wife bought me one of those Radio Shack Car/RV Indoor/Outdoor 
thermometers as part of my birthday booty....so today I decided to put it 
in. It took about 20 minutes to put it in the EV.

I mounted the unit itself on the dash panel which is just to the left of the 
center air vents. This panel pops off, so it makes an easy place to string 
the wire for the outside sensor. I strung the wire across the top of the 
pedal cluster, and behind the fuse box (you need to drop the fuse panel 
cover, and the plate below the fuse box.

The wire then went out through one of the wire gromets that lead to the 
battery box. Next I popped the hood, removed the sealing gasket that runs 
across the upper part of the engine compartment, just below the wiper arms. 

The kit comes with a suction cup mount for the outside sensor. I put the 
mount between the wiper shafts. Once the hood is closed the sensor is 
outside of the slipstream, and in a sheltered area below the hood.

So far it works well. 20 minutes work....and according to the latest Radio 
Shack catalogue...$15.
