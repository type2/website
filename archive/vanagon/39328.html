&gt; I'd like to know if anyone has installed a VW turbodiesel engine in a 1982

I'm working on my own conversion, using a Jetta TD motor.  Scott Foss, of 
Sausalito, Calif., is the only one I know of who has done this conversion.  
He advertises in one of the VW mags.

 &gt; 1.Are there clearance problems with the left motor mount?

The left motor mount, where it meets the steel tube engine cradle, is 
right in the way of the Jetta turbocharger's waste gate.

&gt; 2.The manifolds and turbo will be bolted on a 1986 diesel (hydraulic) block;
&gt; any difficulty with oil return lines, oil feed lines or downpipe to muffler?

The turbo body may need machine work, or at least reassembly to make sure 
the oil drain is straight down when installed in the Vanagon.  The oil 
return line and downpipe will need some degree of fabrication.

&gt; 3.How important are the oil squirters that spray the bottom of the pistons?
&gt; The '86 block has no squirters.

If VW used oil squirters in light duty appplications such as TD Rabbits and 
Jettas, I would think they'd be pretty important in a heavier vehicle 
such as a TD Vanagon.  My motor had 5 thou. bore taper after only 92,000 
miles in a Jetta, so it will need all the help it can get if it is going 
to pull a Vanagon that far.  Of course, if you use the regular diesel 
injector pump instead of the TD one with the anaeroid device, I'd bet you 
would be OK without oil squirters.  Power would be much less that way, 
though.

&gt; 4.Does the turbodiesel engine have a thicker head gasket?

I believe the correct head gasket thickness is determined by measuring 
piston projection above the block, using the same specs. whether TD or 
regular diesel.  However, there is a rebuilder in Eugene who uses the next 
thicker gasket than the specs. call for when building a TD motor, for 
engine longevity reasons he says.

&gt; ANY info. anyone has to share about this conversion will be greatly appreciated.

You're welcome!
