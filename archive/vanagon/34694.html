Subject: M-code questions?

Basic known info:

1967 21 window deluxe
Bench seat (not walk through)
Left hand drive
Canvas sunroof
12volt


On the ID plate behind seat.

            04  8
                     425 025 114
          UP 2412 381370 7005365

I figure (according to the infamous copyrighted M-Codes)

04  8  = August 4th 1967
425    = ? (430 = dual master cyl)
025    = Lap Belts
114    = 6pop out windows

I can't decipher the bottom line at all...help!

The Bus is blue-green (don't know that L-code) bottom and the
white top (again, don't knowe the L-code)

thanks

Kevin
