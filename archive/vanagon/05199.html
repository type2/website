Gee, I wonder if they had to **WORK** ? &lt;grin&gt;

I have gotten very little mail today from any channel.
Maybe I should mention an oddity.  I was working in the back yard 
Saturday when i noticed a pool of coolant on the floor of the 
carport.  I put some more coolant in (it was low) and looked underneath 
and saw that it was indeed dripping from somewhere up there -- looked 
like from the waterpump seal. 

Yesterday we drove the van a few times and each time I checked and there 
was NO leakage.  I'm sort of baffled.  Could it have come out of the top 
of the expansion tank for some reason?
