Subject: Over-optimistic speedometer 

Evenin' all,

this is not directly Vanagon related, but it is about VW speedometers,
so someone out there *must* know...

The speedo in my wife's 88 Fox has always indicated a little high.
Lately the needle has started to &quot;slip&quot;, for lack of a better word, when
above 60mph or so, and jump about.  When it does this it always
indicates a lot higher than actual speed and makes a loud whirring
noise.

Any ideas what this could be?  If the connection between the cable and
the back of the speedo were loose, wouldn't the speedo indicate a lower
speed?  Same if the cable were binding somewhere, no?

Enquiring minds want to know,
Joachim
