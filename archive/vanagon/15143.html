*    Put the Top Down        *
    (Traditional C-Shanty)


As I was a'driving through Dixie so sweet,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
A Vanagon Camper I chanced for to meet.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

We had stopped at a campground, she'd gotten there first.
     Way-hey, put the top down,
I'd been driving all day with one helluva thirst.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

Says she to me, &quot;I'm quite low on oil,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
&quot;Can I borrow some quarts so my engine won't boil?&quot;
     Give me some time to put the top down.

&quot;Delighted!&quot;, I answered, &quot;I've plenty to spare!&quot;
     Way-hey, put the top down,
So I handed two quarts to that camper so fair.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

As she bent adding oil to her camper machine
     Way-hey, put the top down,
I could feel that my interest was certainly keen.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

With my hormones a-rising, and her standing near,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
I asked if she'd join me for one little beer.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

I sipped on a bottle, she chugged a six-pack,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
I leaned over frontwards, she leaned over back.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

Then I opened my pop-top, and asked her inside,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
And there in that camper was a helluva ride.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

She ruffled my curtains, she fondled my seat,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
And down at my stove, she had turned up the heat.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

But just our comfort began to unfold,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
Her foot hit the gearshift, and we started to roll.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

I jumped for the front seat, and grabbed for the wheel,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
She thought it was funny, and let out a squeal!
     Give me some time to put the top down.

And off through the campground and straight for a tree,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
Rolled the camper, the pop-top, the woman, and me.
     Give me some time to put the top down.

Well, a long story shortened: I managed to stop,
     Way-hey, put the top down,
But not til the tree limbs grabbed hold of my top!
     Give me some time to put the top down.

So, young men, take warning, whenever you slake:
     Way-hey, put the top down,
Don't never fool 'round less you pull up the brake!!
     Give me some time to put the top down.

:)
&lt;honest, folks. the original song is much dirtier than this!&gt;
