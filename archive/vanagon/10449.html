So mrmoritz_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt;  1) What is the best book to get to find out how to work on the FI?

&quot;How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive!&quot; by John Muir

&gt;  2) Is the fuel pump supposed to start working when the ignition is 
&gt;     turned on or just after the engine has been turned over?

When you turn the key.  It's electric.

&gt;  3) Should I scrap the FI and get a carb (or two)?

I think you should give the FI system a chance.  Clean up all the electrical
connections (wiring loom) and make sure the battery cables are clean and
have good clean solid connections.  This goes for the transmission ground
strap also.

You can probably scrounge FI system parts from the wrecking yard so you
can swap out suspect parts.  If the injectors are questionable, I'd get
rebuilt ones.  Make sure the valves are adjusted and a good tune-up
is done.

&gt;  Well this is most of it for now, I need to get this bus on the road.  My 
&gt; friends are starting to think they will be driving me around forever.  I 
&gt; have a '73 Camper that I have been tinkering with forever. I plan on 
&gt; putting in all the Westy camper stuff that came out of my dad's '73. (Yes 
&gt; he has one too.  Everyone in my family has a bus or a split.) He took it 
&gt; all out because he didn't want to &quot;carry around all that weight.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;  I enjoy reading all that goes on on the VANAGON list, even though my 
&gt; wife thinks I waste too much time at the computer

Does she read over your shoulder?  Mine does occasionally and enjoys
the reading too.  Maybe you she get your wife to read some of the
stuff.  She might see why you're addicted.  ;)

Enjoy,

Steven
