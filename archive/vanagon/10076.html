So martha rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Steve!  You're talking to a wall!  David S can't hear you - he's
&gt; passed out near your right front wheel.  And Bradley M can't either
&gt; because he's &quot;indisposed&quot; from having too many prunes.  YOu know
&gt; how this group is; you can't tell them anything!  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; /martha
&gt; 

You're right as usual.  That David Schwarzemeister.  While your down
there David, could you bleed my brake just one more time. ;)

Bradley may be indisposed, but it ain't from prunes, ay!  ;p

Cheers!

Steven
