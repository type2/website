Subject:      Re: What coolants are ok?

     Ivan Boyd asked:

          I'm not sure what coolant is currently in my radiator.  Should I
          flush it and replace w/the recommended ones below, or add these
          as needed over time?  If I need to flush it, is this an easy
          process?  Does anyone out there have any tips before I start?

     Ivan-

     Maybe you should check with University VW (or Foreign Aide).  When UVW
     was doing my F.I. recall, I asked them to check the coolant.
     Evidently they have something that can tell them if you have phosphate
     free coolant and if it's still &quot;good&quot;.  Dunno what they might charge
     to do this a s a stand-alone process.

     BTW, if you haven't done it already, call and give UVW your VIN (Bill
     &quot;Squid&quot; Peterson is a good guy to ask for in the service department)
     and ask them to check the computer system to see if there are any
     outstanding recalls on your vehicle.

     Others-

     Sorry about the apparent &quot;locality&quot; of this information (Albuquerque),
     but if you just substitute the name of your local dealer, you may also
     benefit from the suggestions contained herein.
