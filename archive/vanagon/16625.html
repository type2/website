Subject: Re: Ethical question on VW busses


&gt;I've got a dillema that I am hoping you can all help me solve.  Here's the deal.
&gt;I, and I hope, most of you, believe that all microbi should be public domain.
&gt;Microbi are a symbol of love, harmony, and peace with fellow man.
&gt;
&gt;Therefore, it seems to me a hideous crime to lock a microbus.  At the same time,
&gt;however, I do have tools which I keep in her which I consider to be only mine.
&gt;I need them while I'm driving for when she breaks down, of course; and I don't
&gt;want to have to carry my tools in and out every time I drive her.  Yet I'm 
&gt;afraid that, where I live, my tools will be taken if I leave her unlocked.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any valuable insights?


No problem: just move to a deserted island, or to Mars. Sounds like you're
halfway there already.   :)
