&gt;Joel the Troll and the Coyote write about &quot;long dangly things at 65 mph and
a few hundred feet behind you on fishing line&quot; and schematics for radar
detectors? Well eat my flue cover, gang. I stand by my original response.
Y'all *really* need to stop dropping the acid!;) You all can drop out cop
out and leave you buses unlocked at the next &quot;Thom by the Arch&quot; event.

BTW: my connection to the server was down this morning while my co workers
had no problems. All I could think of was as I sat in my meetings was that I
got SPAMED. Dang, explain that to Thom's boss.

Peace, Love, Dove and Bobby Sherman...
