So Martha says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for the words to an oldies song called &quot;The Ballad
&gt; of Billie-Jo&quot; sung by Bobbi Gentry.  You know - the one about
&gt; throwing something off the Talahassee bridge, Choktaw ridge, etc. -
&gt; that should jog your memories.  
&gt; 
&gt; I know this isn't VW related; how about if I say that I want to
&gt; listen to the tune in my westy?  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Second, as I recall the words do not state WHAT Billie-Jo was
&gt; throwing over the bridge, but I remember there was some great
&gt; mystery about this.  Does anyone out there remember what it
&gt; was?

I always surmised it was a body.  Why?  I dunno.


Lyrics?  Lessee....

It was the 3rd of June
Another sleepy dusty delta day.....

I was out pickin' cotton
And my brother was baling hay.....

(ya-all can chime in anytime) ;)

(something here about going back
to the house to eat)

Moma Hollered out the back door
ya-all remember to wipe your feet.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'll let someone else continue, my brain
is too lazy for this one....  ;)
