Subject: 91 Auto Transmission Problem

My 91 Carat was makng some clicking noises from the rear end this morning on the way to work. I 
went to my local VWflaps to pick up some CV boot kits since they were due to be replaced soon 
anyway. While leaving the parts store, the van refused to take off from a light in drive. I 
shifted down into first and it took off normally. When I shifted into second the transmission 
slipped and two seconds later went into 2nd gear. The 2-3 shift didn't slip at all. It drove fine 
the whole way home (15 miles) as long as I manually shited it and let off the gas on the 1-2 
shift. Reverse works normally. The Vanagon has 129,500 miles on it. I tried two private 
transmission shops that both the parts store and the dealership recomended but their Vanagon 
people are out until tomorrow. I normally don't let anyone else work on my vehicles but will 
probably have to make an exception this time.

Any and all responses/solutions/previous experiences will be greatly appreciated. 

TIA
