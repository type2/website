Subject: RE: Alloy wheel deal

&gt; Actually, a little more than 10mm is sufficient too, because it does work. 
&gt; 
&gt; Audi 5000/200 turbo alloy wheel:   6Jx15 H2 ET45
&gt; 
&gt; Vanagon &quot;Carat&quot; 5 spoke alloy wheel: 6Jx14 H2 ET30
&gt; 

WHOA, Frankly I would begin to think about this conversion at this 
point, work or no work, a change in offset of 1.5 cm is going to 
be loading a bearing more than designed, putting say about 50-100 ft-lbs 
additional moment on the spindle (assuming a 1000 lb load).  Just 
cause it fit's don't make it right, take a look at some of the 
slammed civics with 8 inch wheels, bet they get 30k out of a set of 
front wheel bearings.  A data point, FWD performance VW's typically 
in the early years ran stuff ET35 or greater, BMW 3 series (RWD) wheels
had same bolt pattern but 25mm offset, running them was a STRICT NO
NO.  Adding spacers is often a good indication you got a problem, if it 
rubs without em, if you move it it ain't a good idea.  Plus the spacer 
Ron mentions is going to exasperate the bearing problem, as the 45mm 
offset has already shoved the wheel 1.5mm OUTBOARD of where it should 
be, now adding a space shoves it out FURTHER.  Knowing this 
info the Audi wheel is clearly for FWD applications, the van needs a 
RWD wheel.  Fortunately a quick call to Tire Rack shows two readily 
available.  The Borbet Replica II (Mercedes Replica) and Borbet Type  
A are both 15 X 7 with 25 mm offset.  A proper fitment, offset only 
changes 5mm (less than .25 inch) and hence wheel grows nearly evenly 
inside and outside, and quite economical $120 each with new bolts and 
nuts, tested ready to bolt right on.  Go get em if you want to run 
them 15 inch tires, the Type A would look excellent on a Vanagon.
Check it out at http://www.tirerack_dot_com it's a massive 5 spoke thing, 
bolts right up, without machining or spacers.  Of course being 1.5 
inches WIDER than an OEM steel wheel watch for tire rubbing.  Another 
thing I've learned, ALWAYS buy at least 5 alloys when you buy 
aftermarket wheels, if 4 years from now you bust one on a curb/rock 
and the company no longer makes the style, you get left with 3 
worthless chunks of aluminum.

Not to sound like I'm dishing you Ron, but this really sounds a BAD 
idea engineering wise, do you know anybody that has put say 100,000 
miles on a van so converted, if not I'd think twice.
