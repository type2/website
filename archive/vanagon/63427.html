Ok. I took the engine and tranny out and the release shaft fork is broken off.
I need to replace the release shaft, and it looks like I can get one by
tomorrow (fingers crossed). However, I have yet to figure out how the hell I
remove it.  Anyone who knows how to remove it -- I can't find it in Bentley --
please give me a clue!


Thank You.
