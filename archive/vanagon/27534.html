Subject: Re: Hemp as fuel (Was:The Forever Car)

When I was cleaning out my '69 bay window last Spring, I found a fuel stash stored in 
the fresh air duct.

I checked it for purity, determined that it would not pass emissions testing and 
discarded it.

The bus seems a little more peppy now with the alternative fuel removed, but then, again, 
what a price to pay for pep! I think she was happier while running in the the fog.
