&gt; I am planning on buying a stock motor with a new case and installing

&gt; that dual carbs means dual springs.  He quotes some stats about valve 
&gt; train failure and such.  He also warns that most builders do not 
&gt; correctly install and shim dual springs, which can cause a whole other
&gt; set of problems.  My question is this:  do I order my engine with 
&gt; dual springs or go without?  He doesn't say how often others screw 
&gt; this up.  It would seem from his writing that stock single springs 
&gt; would give me more trouble than risking having someone screw up 
&gt; installing dual springs.  Opinions?  Oh, this would be a stock 1600DP 
&gt; going into a '71 bus.  Thanks, Jim

I don't see any connection between dual carbs and dual valve springs,
unless they are assuming that you are going to rev your motor up higher
because of the dual carbs, which is nonsense.  Find out what the rates
on the springs are.  If the dual springs are rated higher, consider
passing on them, because they will just cause more wear on your cam
and valve train.  It is a stock motor, after all.  

As long as we're talking about it, why go with dual carbs?  Having dealt
with them for the last 7 years on my bus, I would never choose any dual
carb setup over a single carb because of the synchronization problems.
This assuming you can get equal mileage and power out of a single carb,
which I'm sure is at least close to the truth.
