Subject: Re: a  really cool VW

i could be wrong but it sounds like a Fridolin? I know they were used by
the German Post Office in the early 70's. They king of look like a Type III
in the front end, and have a sliding door on the front, much as a Bubble
Window van would have

&gt;A friend of mine had a really cool VW.  It was a phone repair vehicle from
&gt;Germany.  Basically it was a bus on a bug chassis.  Someone had converted
&gt;it into a camper, but most of the original interior was intact.  It had
&gt;beautifully made wood cabinets for tools and the like and a collapsable
&gt;front passenger seat so there was more interior room when needed.  The
&gt;front end looked like an oversized Bug with a big wrap around windshield.
&gt;There was a gas heater up front, under the hood, near the gas tank and
&gt;spare tire.   We figured it was from the mid sixties based on the running
&gt;gear.  It had Bus type sliding doors on both sides and these extended from
&gt;the front seats back.  You folded back the front seats to get into the rear
&gt;compartment.  The doors locked open so you could drive with them that way.
&gt; I've never seen one of these around since... Anyone else?
