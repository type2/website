Subject: Re: silver socket and collapsible spare tire
Date: Sat, 7 Jan 95 17:28:27 EST

Unless someone out there with a watercooled westy can confirm otherwise,
it appears that only air-cooled westys had this silver socket and even
then only in the later editions; on the
80-82s the socket appears to be designed for something other than an air
compressor, because they all came equipped with full size tires.
Placement of said socket would also not support the Kautzian air
compressor thesis, since dash placement is not conducive to pumping of
spare tires. Nevertheless we push onward in search of an answer to this
puzzle, conundrum, anomaly and hope, nay pray that someone will shed light
on this all too important issue....

(perhaps the Pfeiffer Peoples Party will have a collective response in the
not too distant future). DC
