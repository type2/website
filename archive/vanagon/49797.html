&gt; My 85 Westy has been diagnosed  with a leaky head gasket thru a pressure
&gt; check followed by a visual check. It looks like this will be an expensive
&gt; repair although the repair costs seem to vary quite a bit depending on wheter
&gt; or not the heads are pitted. I am praying that the block is not pitted. I am
&gt; told but don't know why the heads/block cannot be shaved to remove the
&gt; pitting. I have the following estimates:
&gt; Dealer #1 - $1800-2400 assuming pitted heads and depending on repair of parts
&gt; that
&gt; disintegrate durring disassembly
&gt; Dealer #2 - $500-700 heads not pitted, up to $1800 if heads pitted
&gt; Local VW Mechanic - $1100 using an special sealant which seals the pitted
&gt; heads from an aftermarket guy in New Jersey
&gt; My questions are:
&gt; 1. Has anyone had experience with any kind of sealant that seals pitted heads
&gt; 2. Which comes first, leaking gasket or pitted heads
&gt; 3. If only one head gasket leaks, why replace both head gaskets at the same
&gt; time
&gt; 
&gt; If the heads aren't pitted it's $5-700 but I don't know if they are pitted.
&gt; The special sealant saves money if the heads are pitted but it is also a bit
&gt; of a risk.
&gt; Anyone's experience on this problem is welcome.
&gt;

I have had this problem for about 2 years.  Now at 137k miles.  A good coolant sealant 
added to the antifreeze has bought me two years but I do face head replacement soon.  
My shop has indicated all of these engines they have worked on needed to replace the 
heads due to pitting.  The problem is the phosphate coolant we use rather than 
the not so common phosphate free coolant recommended by VW.  Rebuilt head have been 
quoted to me at $315 to $488 each which included new valves.  I suspect if you do not 
do your own work you would be wise to put in the rebuilt heads, paying for the job only 
once.  That is what I plan to do in the next few weeks.
