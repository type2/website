&gt;         In a matter of time your Vanagon will quit dead! Platinum plugs
&gt;         cause, (only in the Vanagon) the coil to over heat and finally
&gt;         quit!     A how long have you had them in?
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; Eric, You have got to be kidding! Ive run platinums in my 84 Westy for over
&gt; 10 years and 200k mi and am running on the orig. coil.What possible
&gt; correlation could this have to the coil?If it has a higher resistance the
&gt;  coil will not be damaged and it couldnt possibly have zero ohms as the plug
&gt; would be shorted to the electrode.Big deal.

        I guess I should be more clear. It was in my 1980 Vanagon.
        I had put them in, drove for about 1,000 miles, it went 
        dead. Replaced the coil, about 1,500 miles later dead again.
        Another new coil, replaced, the, new plugs, with stock.
