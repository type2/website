Subject: Negavtive current from my generator !!!?????

     Maybe it's a common fault, but it beats the sh*t out of me.
     
     So my mates generator light comes in on his bus, so we figure it's the 
     generator, coz it's producing like no current.
     
     So we get a rebuilt generator (like new) and stick it in. The red 
     light now glows like a flare! putting a voltmeter positive on the 
     battery terminal and negative on D+ we get like -24 Volts, we reckon 
     this comes from current flowing from the battery + the negative 
     current being produced by the generator.
     
     So we took the generator off and did the recommended VAG test of 
     connecting DF to the case and measuring the voltage between D+ and 
     the case whilst spinning the generator at around 2000 revs.
     
     The meter read around -13v and the generator was clearly under load as 
     it should be in this test. But why negative voltage???
     
     And yes, we did have it going the correct way, clockwise looking from 
     the pulley end.
     
     Anyone else had this problem of a generator producing negative current 
     ??
     
     help,
     
     Lee.
