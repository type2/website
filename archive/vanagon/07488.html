Subject: Re: NEW Micro-bus WWW server !!!

&gt;     Ok you guys, it's time to let you loose on my WWW server.
&gt;     
&gt;     Fact is it's running on a 486DX2-66 PC so it might be a bit hesitant, 
&gt;     but give it a try and tell me what happens.
&gt;     
&gt;     The URL is:
&gt;     
&gt;           http://146.87.136.48/homepage.html
&gt;     
&gt;     I know it works from over here and I have had a friend connect from 
&gt;     over there ok.
&gt;     
&gt;     If you don't get any response try &quot;pinging&quot; it to see if it's alive.
&gt;     
&gt;     Well I'm gonna leave it running over the weekend so try not to break 
&gt;     it for me when I get back on Monday, please.
&gt;     
&gt;     Lee.
&gt;
&gt;
The server works great from here, in fact its faster than the physics pages. 
I just checked out all the pictures of your Samba. Is it finished already? 
I'll be in Manchester over Xmas so I might get to see it in the flesh.
