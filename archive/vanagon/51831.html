My brother-in-law can drink a cup of coffee, smoke a cigarette and eat a donut
while driving his Mazda 5-speed pickup through town.  He's a building
contractor. The inside of his truck is spotless.  He keeps his cell phone in
the cup holder.

 I can just barely juggle a half cup of coffee and rassle the shifter on my '86
Vanagon GL while rolling down a deserted freeway.  Just got a Berg shift kit
today, will install it this weekend.  This may be what it takes...
