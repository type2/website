Subject: Re: Penetrating Fluid Recommendations

Thom,  while i have always used liquid wrench, in click-clack, can and not
the spray (you get more for your money by not having to pay for the
propellants) there is also a product by the makers of &quot;Hog Wash&quot;  It is
called &quot;Busty&quot;  simmilar to Liquid wrench only much better.  It is however a
wee hard to find, I would suggest your local &quot;Ma and Pop&quot; type auto supply
and not the &quot;Auto Zone,&quot; or simmilar chains.

&gt;using Liquid Wrench, but it seems like there has to be something out
