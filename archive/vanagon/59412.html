Subject: 93 EV MV FS

I was at Regal Dodge in Sunnyvale, CA  (408) 738-0400 dropping off a
company truck for service.  Stuck among all of the domestics was my MV's
twin. White MV (Bed+Table) with 5 speed.  had 64K miles and they were
asking $17K/negotiable. (I'd offer $10K :-&gt;  )  It looked good but you
never can tell with a dealer.  Don't E-mail me but I thought if you are in
the SF Bay area and in the market for an EV this one might be worth
checking out.
