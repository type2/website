Subject: Re: stove=heater=safe? 


&gt; Hey James,
&gt; 
&gt; Martha and I have been discussing here plans to use the stove as
&gt; a heater off-line.  She's concerned about the by products of the
&gt; LP burn and how to evacuate/vent them out of the camper.  I thought
&gt; that there were no nasty by-products from burning LP gas and that
&gt; the only concern would be the replacement of oxygen.  Can you
&gt; or anyone else clarify this?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Steven

Wrong. Propane combustion emits carbon monoxide and water vapor, and, if 
not adjusted properly, other toxic gasses. I hate to be so repetitive on 
this but I'm really afraid someone other there is going to kill themselves.
