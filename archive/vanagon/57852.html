Subject: Rust repair questions

I'm still in the process of cleaning up some seam rust behind the 
rear bumper on my '88 Westy and have a few questions:

The latest VW Custom &amp; Classic issue on rust repair talks about using 
an &quot;All Metal&quot; filler (as opposed to epoxy) to provide a waterproof 
coating where filling is needed. In their case, their were cutting 
the metal out &amp; welding in a patch, something I cannot do as I don't 
have a welder.

Since none of my rust is perforated (although it may be if I keep 
sanding..), I was thinking of using an &quot;all metal&quot; filler once I 
have removed all visible rust, to help smooth the pitted areas. I 
bought some stuff called &quot;Liquid Aluminum&quot; since it was the closest 
I could find. The rust extends 1&quot;-2&quot; on either side of the horizontal 
seams at the lower rear, behind the bumper.

Am I making a potential mistake by introducing this filler stuff? I 
don't need it for cosmetics, since it's hidden, but thought it may 
help keep the rust away longer.

btw,
I'm also planning to replace all mounting bolts with stainless, as I 
have done with nearly every bolt/screw removed in the last year... 
Cost me a whole $4 to replace all the marker light, water hookup, 
etc, screws.
