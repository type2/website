Subject: MLKjr Day, Little Martha, reconstruction

	Myths of the Reconstruction.

	This weekend I spent another enjoyable 8-10 hours working on 
Little Martha, mostly dedicated to and and in honor of Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. Were he still alive, he'd still be just a few weeks 
shy of a year older than my dad. I spent yesterday working on my truck 
and listening to the radio and thinking about what I could do to make 
the world a better place. Dr. King believed in hard work, not letting 
time take care of things, and that's good for social justice, old VWs 
or anything else you care to name.

	Re-assembling Little Martha, '70 single cab, is a lot more 
work than I had figured on at first. Earlier in the weekend I'd had 
a final shot at the passenger door lock and gotten it to release just 
fine by bending outward the tab that the release handle presses. But it
still won't unlock from outside if someone pulls the release trigger 
after it's locked. So I gave up and went to the driver's side door
and installed the new matching-keyed handle. It locks and unlocks
and opens when released, and only jams *sometimes* if the release
trigger is pulled when it's locked. I call this success, but clearly
there's more to learn here.

	Maybe I've bent-out the little adjuster for the release too far 
and its catching... and I should probably pull the driver's side lock 
for cleaning and re-greasing. Bah, humbug! So far, the door locks
have taken the most time and given the lease satisfaction on this whole job.

	One of the two 13mm tubes on the aircleaner for crankcase 
ventilation had benn ripped out of the aircleaner sheetmetal, so I 
cleaned tube and aircleaner with acetone and glued them together 
with JB WELD, a pretty good high-strength filled epoxy. It seemed
to hold fine.

	I hooked up the fan-shroud air-tap to the left end of the
charcoal canister, right side of canister to the air-cleaner, the
lower 13mm nipple that's right at the intake horn. Smaller diameter 
tubing connects the charcoal canister to a tube which comes from the 
filler door area. I used some large-size german fuel-line for it.

	The BUGPACK muffler bolts right onto my extractor, and I 
generously coated the 8mm bolts, nuts and lock washers with anti-seize.
Who knows, it might even help. Interestinly, the 8mm nuts used a 13mm
wrench, but two of the three bolts took a 12mm! (I think that's japanese
standard- I hardly use any even-number metric wrenches except 10 and 8.)

	I put one turn on the throttle adjustment (the one that holds the 
throttle,  same as putting your foot down slightly) and the engine now 
idles happily-  I'm not sure that's the official idle adjustment though- 
have to look at the book.

	  The _at_#$$% primary wire from battery to starter now has its 
grommet correctly installed- argh, what a lousy job THAT is! I tried
pushing with fingers from both sides, tried the string trick, just 
couldn't get to grips with it. I should have done a good job of this
before installing the engine, when it would have been easy. Finally
got it in by unbolting my bolted-in replacement air-cleaner support
and using a small, long, screwdriver to poke the front side of the grommet
through the hole, while keeping the rear part to the rear. It CAN be done.

Warm-air ducts from the heat-exchangers to heater pipe are connected
Paper air-ducts for heat exchangers and chimney-to-air-cleaner installed.
I gave my big black accordian-larvae connector tubes to someone on the
list, who still hasn't sent me $5 for postage (!). You Know Who You Are.
My beloved brother advocated and provided Beetle air-ducts, made of
sheetmetal and wrapped in vinyl. I got the right side to fit by
compressing it COMPLETELY and then installing one end and horsing
it around. The left side still would't fit, so I finally cut 
away about an inch and a half, taped over the loose edge and installed it.

	And here's where I realized what a fool I've been- you'll 
recall I spent a lot of time and effort getting my heat exchanger
flapper valves lined up and working, based on the pictures in the
Bentley book. Got the flap operating arms on the inside of the
exchangers, right? Well guess what? My chassis wants the flap levers on
the outside!!! So I guess I wire 'em open in the winter and closed in
the spring... :) Sheesh! I guess I could have looked more closely!!


	The hardest part was the inner CV- the CV and the boot-flange
associated with it were between .5 and 2 degrees misaligned, so you could
get a screw through them up to the ends of the threads, but after that,
nothing. I finally got out my industrial hot air gun and heated
the CV and flange, then pried and tapped, finally worked a bold back
in and put the allen key in it's head and tapped with the hammer on it.
Sproing! the sticky CV grease allowed the two to separate and I was done
10 minutes later. But I probably took an hour fooling with it first, maybe
longer. For starters, I have to work out whether it made more sense to
install inner or outer CV first. I decided outer first and I think its
a good decision.

	And yes, I cleaned-up the inside of the stub-axle and final
drive before installing the new CV.

	I wore through three or four pairs of vinyl gloves, but my 
hands were substantially cleaner than usual. Besides that, I've also
gotten a big piece of upholstry cloth to lay under the Bus when
I'm crawling around down there- pads my back and head, and makes
everything much warmer.

	Cheers!
	Bill
