 &gt; Indeed, I suspect the many problems
 &gt; that afflict the water-cooled vans stems from not having a water-cooled Bug
 &gt; parked in the same garage.

I have an '86 Jetta to go with my '84 van.  I suspect it's as close as I can 
get to a water-cooled Beetle.

Doesn't help.

This morning I went through the ignition control harness with a fine 
tooth-comb.  All is fine.  I am left surmising the brain is dead.  Sigh.  
Dealer wants $395, Bugformance wants $498, I'm waiting for a third quote.

Does fuel injector resistance of 19.4 ohms where the spec is 16 to 16.4 
indicate a problem?
