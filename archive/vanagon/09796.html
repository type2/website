&gt;Well, a couple of weeks ago my drivers side high beam inner lens
&gt;got broke.  How, I don't know.  I never heard a thing.  I checked
&gt;the Bentley, and it only discusses the sealed beam replacement.
&gt;Do I have to replace the lens, the hole schmutz or what?

as i recall from days when i had square headlights :)  the replacement
glass parts CAN be ordered separately.

now ... when you recover from the heart attack that you will surely have
when they tell you the price for that fixture, let me know. if you can't
find one in a local junkyard, i might be able to help.
