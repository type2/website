Subject: Syncro: to lock or not to lock

I just got this '86 Westfalia GL Syncro.  A lot of little thing were wrong
with it and I am having them fixed.  No big deal.

When I bought it the rear differential lock did not work.  I talked to a
couple of mechanics and they told me that it is common for the servos to go
bad and should be no problem to fix.

Well the shop, which charges $70 per hour, has spent two hours and can only
tell me that it is not the servo and that some thing is stuck.  They say that
they will have to tear open the transmission and have no idea what they will
find.  They recommend that I drive without fixing.  That I will only need it
if I get stuck and that the 4-WD works great.

Anybody out there ever use there rear differential lock?  How much would it
cost to replace the whole tranny?

Frustrated and owned a VW less than a week,
