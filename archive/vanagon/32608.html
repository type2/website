&gt;
&gt;B.U.S. (Bus Users Sect) in a new type II connection for parts, meets 
&gt;campouts and general information about your bus. For an application 
&gt;please send a self addressed envolope to:
&gt;					  B.U.S.
&gt;					  9 Young Cr.
&gt;					  Saskatoon, Sask.
&gt;	
To All:

Within the intelligence community B.U.S. is known to be the Saskatoon faction
of the Weatherhead Underground.  They have already been infiltrated by RCMP
(CID) and any contact with them will cause your vehicle to be added the list
of buses presently being watched by federal, state or local authorities.  

However, wrapping your antenna with flannel will cause the RCMP to look the
other way, unless you give the Sect Signal, picking your nose with your
little finger while signaling for a left-turn when meeting another VW bus,
unmarked RCMP vehicle or the state bird of Texas.

These instructions do not apply to Fridays and are invalid when driving under
water, over asphalt or with more than one wheel in contact with the ground.

Remember:  Vanagon Security is Everyone's Busyness.
