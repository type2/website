The Inuvik Run -- In the Woods

It is my second day in Canada.

I'm at the British Columbia Provincial Park on Ten Mile Lake, a
few miles north of the town of Quesnel.  Quesnel is pronounced
'QuiNELL'.  Ten Mile Lake is neither ten miles from Quesnel nor
ten miles in length.  Now that Canada has dropped the English
system of measurement, places such as Ten Mile Lake and Hundred
Mile House stand out from more recent place-names such as Twelve
Kilometer Taco Stand.

Quesnel and much of the rest of the upper Fraser River valley
enjoyed several days of torrential rain that stopped the day I
arrived.  The Provincial Park is situated on a boggy bit of land
that shows strong evidence of the recent rain, with many rills
trickling thru the brush surrounding the campsites and numerous
puddles, all occupied by zillions of voracious mosquitos.

Each campsite has a table and fire ring.  There are three water
faucets for 50+ campsites.  Each fire ring is provided with a
mound of soggy birch.  A large bin near the water spigot holds
additional firewood, all sopping wet.  Occupied campsites can be
located by the sullen pall of smoke oozing from the firepit
toward the lake.

I have an interesting landlady, a skinny Scandinavian type with a
shining helmet of blond hair.  I noticed her walking ahead of me
when I was carrying water back to my campsite.  She has long,
lean legs and a graceful dancer's walk.  I was delighted when she
did a precise right-face at my campsite, strode up to the bus and
peered boldly inside.  I put on my best grin and rattled my
bucket.  She charged me twelve bucks Canuck and strode off.  I
didn't notice the biker tattoo on her arm until she handed me my
change.  I think I've been away from home too long.

As Provincial Parks parks go, Ten Mile Lake is definitely
Upscale, having hot showers -- for a price -- and flush toilets. 
There are 110vac outlets in the bathrooms, suitable for electric
shavers or charging lap-top computers and a short hike will take
you to a telephone were a bit of work with your Swiss Army knife
and Radio Shack jumpers will provide you with an RJ-11 interface.

My change was three one-dollar coins.  On the face of the coin is
Queen Elizabeth, age about fourteen.  On the obverse is a loon. 
The coins are twelve-sided and are called, appropriately,
&quot;loonies&quot;.  I developed a keen interest in loonies shortly after
making camp when I discovered it takes a loonie to get four
minutes of hot water in the shower.  An enterprising young man on
a trail bike saw me peering at the sign on the shower-room door
while hopelessly pawing through an assortment of Mexican and
American coins.  He offered to sell me one loonie for four
American quarters.  I made a counter-offer of a one-thousand peso
coin, one of the old ones, for ten loonies.  We shared a little
grin, one wheeler-dealer to another.  Such talents are surely
wasted in the backwoods of British Columbia. 

What with all the driving over the past couple of days, this was
my first chance to get after my laundry and prepare a decent meal
-- steak and onions, mashed potatoes with gravy, corn on the cob
and cheese biscuits.  To get a fire going I prowled the woods in
back of my campsite until I found a blow-down, split the little
end and hacked out enough kindling to ignite the soggy birch
provided by the park.  But birch doesn't leave any coals to speak
of, burning up like newspaper once it's alite.  I ended up
unpacking the Coleman, using the fire ring only to heat water for
washing up and to do the baking.

Later...

I got my loonies worth.  I'm so clean I squeak.  

The building housing the showers is in a conspicuous location at
the junction of two roads, very easy to find.  Yet there seemed
to be an awful lot of giggling confusion going on near the
building.  When I asked who was next it turned out to be the
funniest thing anyone had ever heard.  After a lot of giggling
with their hands over their mouths, it was decided that I was
next.

The reason for the giggles became clear when the door opened and
a young couple came out.  They didn't look especially clean and
she'd managed to bathe without getting her hair wet.  

There are a lot teenagers in the camp.  Either Canadian families
tend to be large or large families tend to be campers or...  or
some damn thing.  In any case, there are a lot of youngsters. 
And they get dirty and have to take showers.  The kids gather in
groups around the shower building, boys over there, girls over
here, giggling and kidding and daring each other to share a
shower like kids urging each other to ask someone for a dance. 
Eventually the offer is made and...   and Canada grows!

Grumpy, old and alien, I showered alone.

I hope my batteries hold up.  I'm playing the stereo (Stones,
Mama's and the Poppa's) which runs off the engine's battery, and
using the computer, which runs off the auxiliary.  Neither
battery is new and it's going to be a long trip with lots of time
spent locked in the cabin to avoid the mosquitos.

The sun did its temperature trick again, a drop of at least
twenty degrees the instant the sun dipped below the mountains to
the south.  It dips into the forties overnight, pushes eighty
during the day, a 'long' thermometer in weatherman-speak.

The moon is waxing toward full.  I think it's about three days
past new and that's bad.  Mosquitos love moonlight.  So do
giggling young campers desperately in need of a bath.

-------

Since leaving California I've seen about a dozen VW vans, mostly
breadloafs.  No splitties at all.  Wave-ratio is running about
one in four, not real good.  I'm worried about missing the group
when they come thru tomorrow night.
 
Ten Mile Lake has a resident loon.  Most lakes do up in this part
of the world.  I haven't heard the call of a loon since I was a
kid.  The sound triggered a vivid recollection of the first time
I heard a loon's wild laughter.  The memory has been upstairs in
the memory locker for half a century yet replayed itself with
perfect fidelity. 

So far it's been a nice trip.  I'm 1,783 miles from home.  My
tranny has started to growl and I need to do my link pins and
change my oil and give her a lube but we're still mobile.  The
engine is running sweetly and I haven't had any tire problems I
couldn't fix.  Except for the border crossing it has been a good
run, so far.
