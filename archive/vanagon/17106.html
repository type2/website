Subject: Re: how NOT to replace fuel hoses...

So Sami Dakhlia says:
&gt; 
&gt; Empty and drain your fuel tank before you attempt to replace them old fuel
&gt; lines!!! Don't relive my nightmare. 
&gt; 
&gt; It just wouldn't work. The old hose was off and the new one refused to get
&gt; in place and the stuff comes gushing out all over my face and eyes and I'm
&gt; blinded, but I can't let go because another 9 gallons are still in there.
&gt; Half a gallon of gasoline later, the second attempt fails and I rest a
&gt; little, fighting off a panic attack. Then the third attempt fails, too,
&gt; and I'm *soaked* in gasoline. Finally the fourth attempt works, but, man,
&gt; I'm NOT proud of myself. I present myself with the &quot;Con du Jour&quot; award. 

Boy Sami, can I sympathize with you!  I remember the first time I changed
the fuel filter on my wife's '70 squareback.  Whew! did I get soaked.  One
spark and I would've been flambe.  I had no fire extinguisher at the time
either.  And the squareback has 8 - 10 hoses to replace right under the tank.  
Needless to say, I learned my lesson and waited till the car was real low 
on gas and then drained the rest out.  Made the hose change a cinch.  I
also keep a fire extinguisher within arms reach at all times.
