&gt; 
&gt; Hello Californians,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Just flew into the Bay Area and will stay here until the 28th. Then I'll
&gt; drive down the L.A. and possibly San Diego. Will return to Misery on
&gt; January 5th, so unfortunately will not make it to the Bulli-Treff on the 6th.
&gt;

  If you're near Palo Alto, call me at 415 857 8249. I'll buy lunch.
