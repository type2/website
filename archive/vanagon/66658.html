Subject:      Re: Coolant Boiling over in the Refill Tank

&gt; coolant was coming out of the top of the refill tank where there are release
&gt; holes.  BTW, it was about 85 def F.  Warm but not scorchingly so.  I let things
&gt; cool a bit, added about a half a litre of water and pushed off.  No signs of
&gt; problems the rest of the way home.
&gt; Does any one have any ideas as to what may have caused the problem?

We seem to be having a rash of bad coolant tank caps that aren't holding
preasure.  That the cap off and if you can suck air thru it, it's bad.
Mine was bad a few weeks ago.  Cost about $12 at dealer.
