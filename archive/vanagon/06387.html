Yowza!  Sounds good.  But why all that trouble
and not do the tranny?  If it's as good as they
say &amp; the receipts and condition are all on the
level, I might knock you out of the way and buy
it myself ;).  Seriously, seems reasonable.  I
would consider having it undercoated, but only
by a reliable outfit that knows how to clean up
after themselves.  As for stone chips, etc., you
can only enjoy 'em if you drive 'em.  Carry some
touch-up paint.
