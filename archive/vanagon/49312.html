Calvin will be coming.  He's a Golden pure bred, will play with anyone who has 
a tennis ball, hates roller blades and kids who tease him (he just barks and 
acts like he's going to bite), loves beer and some whiskeys, will eat anything 
but please don't feed him, and was a member of the very second CCC trip to 
Jawbone canyon, loves Bradley too but then again who doesn't?

&gt; I have seen kids mentioned...and now time for dogs...
&gt; 
&gt; I will be bringing Argo and Lacey. Argo is a regular to these events
&gt; and is the resident pre-washer of dishes, weighing in at a meager 80lbs;
&gt; a golden retreiver mix. Argo especially loves Bradley, who likes to 
&gt; experiment with Argo's digestive system, making my ride home always
&gt; a pleasure. This will be Lacey's first outing with this group - she
&gt; weighs in at around 100lbs; also a golden mix. If y'all thought Argo
&gt; liked table scraps, you will be amazed at her plate cleaning 
&gt; abilities. She is the most determined begger I have seen...don't leave
&gt; your plates around! They are both great with kids...my 12 year old
&gt; neighbor walks and spoils them everyday.
&gt; 
&gt; On an off the subject topic...for those in the San Jose area...Adobe
&gt; is moving into our new tower right now...looking out at the smog filled
&gt; air from the 16th floor....this tower is kewl...uh-huh, huh-huh, ...
&gt; anyone out there need a unix job? We need unix peoples! I have learned
&gt; more about unix and networks over this weekend then I have in 10 years;
&gt; but unfortunately i have slept about 10 hours since thursday...woohoo!
