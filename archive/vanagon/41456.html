Subject: Re: trip report :(

Joel,
Good idea.  I had planned on checking my battery anyway as last time I checked,
one cell was completely dry.  I have a feeling that maybe if one cell is dry,
the car's lights and everything will be bright, but there just won't be enough
juice to turn the starter.

I swear, I won't do it again!

But, I now need advice.  Going back to school in August (even hotter!) I will
need to load up the van once again and make the 6-hour trip from here to
Fredericksburg.  
What can I do to make sure it doesn't happen again?  I know I will check the oil
when I stop for gas, but do I need to stop after a while and let it cool or
what?

Any advice from anyone will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Sean
