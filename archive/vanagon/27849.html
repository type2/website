Subject: T-shirt (finally!) scanned
Date: Wed, 1 Nov 1995 09:01:13 -0800 (PST)

Volks,
	I took some time to scan in Richard's T-shirt this morning.  I was
already late for work, so what the hell.  :)  It can be seen at:

The graphic was too large for the scanner so I had to do it in two
halves.  Also, I forgot to shrink it down when I scanned it.  Later
today when I have time I will shrink it down a little and perhaps make a
preview icon for it.  Right now it's two images inline for 170K so if
you are on a modem be prepared for a wait...

-David
