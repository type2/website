Hi, Folks!

&gt;.....Since I have started reading the list my '81 Westy has
&gt;dropped a valve seat :-( But thanks to your help, I have
&gt;ordered a rebuilt engine from AVP in California. These folks
&gt;Specialize in Vanagon engines, as well as install them. They
&gt;really seem to know their stuff.

&gt; stuff deleted &lt;

Can somebody tell me about AVP?  (and any other tried and true engine sources
around).  I just joined the list.  I also just bought and towed home an '82
Vanagon L with a trashed engine (it was cheap though!  $450!).  I'll be
pulling the engine this weekend and will probably rebuild it myself, but would
consider alternative ways to get it moving.  I'd also be happy to have
something else in it while the rebuild is happening.

&gt;Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions on how to fix my fuel pump
&gt;problem. I believe the problem is indeed lack of fuel tank venting. I
&gt;couldn't find any venting to unclogg, so I walked out of the shop this A.M.
&gt;with a cordless drill and a tiny drill bit and 'vented' the gas cap. It
&gt;doesn't seem to leak, and if this is a real faux pas, I'm only out a gas
&gt;cap.

&gt; stuff deleted &lt;

Please tell me that you removed the gas cap from the vehicle first!

       truck in mash mode....)
