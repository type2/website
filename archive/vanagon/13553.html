Subject: Ancient tale of woe (longish)

Quoth Michael Heron, who when he passes on shall be consigned to the Hell 
of Unedited Replies ;^}
 
&gt; i have seen buses get to the point that the sliding door will actually fall
&gt; right off, because the rocker is so rusty! So when you open the door make
&gt; sure that your feet are not underneath! I don't know how difficult it is to

This made me think of a dark night in 1978, when I was driving Maj. 
Hangover (my '62 Deluxe) home on a two-lane highway.

[Bus details sidebar: this was a &quot;Sunroof Deleted&quot; model, with corner 
windows but no portholes.  A previous owner had stripped the interior of 
_everything_ back of the walk-thru cab and Baja'd the rear wheel wells, 
but at least the shell was solid.]

As I approached the point where I would have to turn left into my 
neighborhood, a long line of cars coming from the opposite direction 
(returning from the dog tracks in Monticello, FL) forced me to sit and 
wait.  This was on a long straight section of US90, east of 
Tallahassee, where the road undulates over some pretty decent hills.

I was stopped at the bottom of the hill, idling, counting the oncoming 
cars and checking the rearview while I waited.

Back up the hill behind me, about a half-mile, a car was approaching.

See the car.
Tap the brake pedal a few times to make sure he sees I'm stopped.
How many more cars until I can turn?
Check the rearview.  Coupla hundred yards back, now.
Tap the brakes.
Count the cars.
Check the rearview.
Headlights moving at a really brisk clip as they disappear below the back 
window and WHANG! an enormous Chinese gong sound and I have teleported 50 
feet down the highway, then silence.

Who am I?  What planet is this?

No injuries, except where the slide-out underdash tape deck has slid out 
and whacked my knee before dropping to the floor.  Engine's still 
running.  I pull over and get out.  The cue ball that hit me is a 
mid-size station wagon, whose front end now looks like Wierd Al's 
favorite instrument.  The driver, also uninjured, is just sitting there, 
very calm in his straw cowboy hat.  Turns out he's crocked, with a 
Florida tag, Mississippi address, and Alabama license, and no insurance.  
&quot;Is this Florida?&quot; he asks me.

Maj. Hangover has sustained a crumpled right rear corner, with buckling 
extending forward past the vents.  The rear floor bulges upward, but the 
rear hatch still works.  I lift the engine lid and its hinges give way; 
when it falls it does a nasty thing to my sandaled foot, doubling my 
injuries from the accident.  The rear crossmember is now two-dimensional, 
and the extractor is, er, reconfigured.

But it was still completely driveable!  The cop said Ed Earl was probably 
doing at least 50mph when he hit me (my Dad and brother heard the crash 
from inside the house, at least 1/4 mile away).  But $500 (of my money, of 
course) later it was not only straight but repainted in more seemly 
colors, and lived through at least two more minor insults (caused by me)
while I owned it.

And am I ever paranoid about cars coming up behind me when I'm waiting to 
make a left. :-)

Hope you were entertained,
Joe
