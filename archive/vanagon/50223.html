Subject: Get this Geezer into a bus !

        If this fellow owned a bus and could still drive, he could put his
overt friendliness to good use out on the road. Donations for the cost
of a bus are accepted here... : )


&quot;TOTOWA, N.J. (AP) - Totowa isn't the neighborhood for Mister Rogers
because saying &quot;Hi neighbor&quot; is being discouraged.

Police there have asked the 79-year-old man to stop sitting on his front 
lawn and waving to all who go by.

Neighbors think Joseph Cerce's friendliness has become a nuisance, 
and a few called police. They say the waves lead to friendly honks from 
passing cars and the noise is driving them crazy.&quot;
