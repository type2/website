Hooray is right,

Not to be a naysayer, but don't go on any long trips anytime soon. 
Hopefully you're right and the plugs were your complete problem.  Just
a  note on my personal experience.  When my vanagon began to misbehave,
I too (amongst MANY other things) replaced the spark plug wires and one
WAS indeed bad.  My van worked perfect for 3 weeks.  Then back to the
same-old-same-old.  Although, if you've changed out all the other stuff
already, then you probably will be okay.  I honestly believe that it was
more than just one item bad on my van (the last 'fix' being the coolant
temp. sensor).  Because I KNOW that plug wire was bad, and the
distributor cap where that plug connected was all corroded up, and there
WERE vacuum leaks, and the coolant sensor was bad, and ...  Maybe
sometimes it's an accumulation of problems that all manifest themselves
at once.

And I know what your wife is putting you through, I hear it all the time
from my husband!  He's been wanting to sell my van for a year now.
