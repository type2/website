&gt;If you are serious and live out of Atlanta I might be
&gt;willing to go look at this one for you.

God, you really know how to hurt a guy!  My 67 Deluxe
restoration is 99% complete, my 67 double cab is next and
after a brake job my 67 Westy is ready for the road.  That
single cab looked good until I saw the price.  I paid $750
for the double cab and $750 for the Westy.  I guess I will
just put $3900 into both of them instead.

Now, if I can just come up with that much money AND pay
tuition at U of I for my daughter....

Oh well, a bus in hand is worth two in the bush.  Or was
that a bush in hand is worth two in the bus?

Any other takers out there?
