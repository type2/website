Subject: Epoxy

Has anyone come across a particularly effective epoxy??  I tried some PC-11
recommended by my neighborhood True Value to hold a stud in a stripped hole,
but it backed out when I tried to torque the nut after an overnight set.
Maybe some engine heat and another 6-8 hours will make a difference?  Or
maybe I didn't use enough??  I seem to remember someone saying something
about JB Weld.....better product???
