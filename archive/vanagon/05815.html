Subject: crankshaft oil seal leak

Hello group-

I just found this list and it's like manna from heaven.  Could someone 'out there' help me with an infuriating recurrent problem?  I have a '85 Vanagon (multivan) with the 1.9L, AT, PS, AC.  The vehicle has 110K on the odo and I need to replace my front crank seal for the *5th* time.  Here's the history:

~40K oil leak and seal replaced

~70K same thing

~85K seal and AT drive plate replaced due to slight scoring

~100K seal replaced and a 'speedy sleeve' put over the drive plate

~now at 110K the seal is leaking again!

All work is being dealer performed and quite frankly, they SEEM quite competent and I'm on very good terms with them.  There is a moderate amount of blowby from the breater tube but it doesn't seem excessive.  I've tried just running the breather thru a length of 3/4&quot; heater hose (current setup) but that doesn't make any difference.  I'll be forever grateful if someone has some insight to this problem.

Please respond to me via private email as I haven't gotten on the mailing list proper yet.
