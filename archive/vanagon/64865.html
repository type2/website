&gt; I think Diesel Johns idea is great. In fact I proposed it a couple of
&gt;months ago. It helps to know where problems/for sales are so you can
&gt;ignore or pursue. It also is nice to know if someone is in the area where
&gt;you live in case you might want to get together to work on a project or
&gt;share a brew! There are a lot of maintenance and repair jobs I want to
&gt;do, but would rather have a helping hand with ( two heads are better than
&gt;one ). I try to always include my city in my signature and no one has
&gt;violated my privacy.

&gt;Steve and Jo Ann Wacker

ditto.  I always find it helpful and interesting to know where fellow
listees are in this world.
