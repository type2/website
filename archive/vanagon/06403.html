Subject: Westy rental?

I seem to recall a while back someone mentioned some outfit out west that rented
westfalias. My father has accumulated a bunch of frequent flyer miles, and
wants to fly the family to Oregon or Washington. Although I would love to drive
my bus, that has been vetoed, so if anyone knows any names, addresses, etc. Of
a place on the west coast somewhere that would rent, for  halfway decent price,
a Westfalia, please let me know.
thanks,
Richard
