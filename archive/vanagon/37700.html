&gt; Oh you want a Mexibus.  I doubt it.  The Mexican VWs do not live up to 
&gt; the German VWs.  

&gt; This is the point completely even though it may have been TIC.
Who is DOT or any other other agency that feel they need to protect us 
from whatever evils lay out there?  A well regulated militia being 
necessary to the security of a free state, etc; ie protect our shores if you 
will; is pretty close to what we need from the gov.
 
I  should decide if I want a &quot;Mexibus&quot; whether you or the men in white 
coats like it or not.

The fight to take  control of the gov from the &quot;guys in white coats&quot; and 
give it back to the people needs to get back on track. 

Vote.
