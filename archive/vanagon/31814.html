Subject: Re: How to hot wire a VW or what to do when your dash goes up in smoke

&gt;It was then, back at the van, that it dawned on me that all I needed was juice
&gt;to the coil and maybe she'd run.  Crawling under the van I cut a 3ft length of
&gt;my ignition wire (the thing was dead anyway) and stripped off an inch or so
&gt;from each end.  One end I wrapped around the hot side of my aux. selinoid

        I keep a stretch of 10ga. wire with a .250 female conector on one
end and a alligator clip on the other in my electrical box for just such
purposes. When I have problems,  I just plug 'er in and get back on the
road. Looks kinda funny when I have to kill my engine by popping the back
lid, but it beats bein' stuck and having to diagnose in a cold/wet/bad
neigborhood/whatever situation...
and new points are cheap.

Peace,
