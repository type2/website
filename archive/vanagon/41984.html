Brandy -

One word of caution when you remove the rear shift rod next weekend.  Be
careful of the bushings  in front and rear when extracting the rear shiftrod
as they ARE NOT available at this time (VW in it's infinite wisdom quit
makin' 'em about two years ago) and we're paying H-E-double toothpick trying
to find more.  Right now I'd settle for just one of each type NOS, 'cause I
have a place that will repro' 'em for me, if I can just find the blasted
things.

My .005 cents worth :)
