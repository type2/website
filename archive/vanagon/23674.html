Subject: EberSpacher(sp) FS 350.00 or trade!

Forgot to mention in previous For Sale stuff post&gt;

Eberspacher Gas Heater

Turbine Style, model BN4

Mounts on rubber isolation feet in rear Drivers side engine compartment.
muffler pokes through hole in bottom firewall. Blows heat through ducting
which exits engine compartment/enters rear area by back seat...

Looks complete. Has sheet metal tunnel to patch thru  R.R. wheel well
comes with cable, wiring and schematics. tested fans, fuel pump, etc,etc
but didn't fire it up yet.

Specs on side plate inform you (in German) that the unit is 12v and has a
heat range of between 0, 1080-4000...It doesn't specify if this is BTU's
or some other measurement, but the unit I have in my bus (same model, but
used looking) blows us out at medium setting. We've never used it at high!

Unit looks like new. minimum use on it as all the shroud paint is original
and not yet blistered away by exhaust. Plastic turbine prop is still brite
red and the glow plug looks new...

Looking for a nice pair of Safari windows w/hardware...

Hey! I'm in Florida...What do -I- need with a Killer Aux heater...I need
some type of Air Conditioning........
