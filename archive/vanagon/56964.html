&gt;I have been following this recommendation in all of my cars every 3
months/3K miles and have 
&gt;never had any work done on any of my fuel injection systems.

&gt;&gt;Being a neophyte with a wasserboxer engine I am looking for opinion on fuel
&gt;&gt;injector cleaner.  The archives have several messages endorsing the use of
&gt;&gt;FI cleaner.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What is the conventional wisdom on this product (brand, frequency of
&gt;&gt;use,caveats)?
&gt;&gt;Does anyone out there recommend against using it?
&gt;&gt;Do any fuels, such as premium, contain it already?


This is becoming generally accepted wisdom; be aware however that Chevron
markets several different fuel cleaners that come in very similar black
bottles - &quot;Techron&quot; is definitely what you want (I work in a machine shop, &amp;
many years ago our CNC machines were having various lubrication problems
that were obviated when we followed the advice of the folks that do our
yearly factory maintenance - they told us to get rid of all our Sh*ll
products, &amp; use nothing but Mobil or Chevron...no lube problems since).
