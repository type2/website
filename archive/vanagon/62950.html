Subject: Re: Which Subaru engine?

Subaru still makes the SVX.  But owing to availability problems, I'd
probably go with the 2.5L 4 cyl from the outback.

I'm trying to figure out how to replace the front rotors on my VW with GM
11&quot; vented disks (of course I'll change to the proper calipers).

Also, looking at the Bentley, it looks as if the front rotors for a syncro
might be a replacement for the rear drums.  I think that the parking brake
issue could be solved.

Any other dreamers out there?

&gt; For what it is worth, I also thing the legacy engine would make a better
&gt; choice.  Correct me if I am wrong but did the 6 cylinder come only in the
&gt; SVX?  If so you will have to consider the avaliability and cost of the
&gt; engine and replacement parts.  Not to mention, the strain on the drive 
&gt; train, you will also need a brake system upgrade to stop the
&gt; shoe box when you are doing 100+ with 7 people, while pulling the trailer
&gt; and the A/C blasting. Also subaru no longer produces the SUX?

&gt; &gt; How about the six cylinder Subaru?  Would it be too much power?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I saw an ad for a Subaru 1800 4WD asking just GB#50 that 50 pounds for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engine. Should I buy this as an insurance policy?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Lionel,
&gt; &gt; &gt; The 2.2L Legacy engine is a much better candidate- more power, more
&gt; &gt; &gt; efficient, more modern. Available in turbo version.
