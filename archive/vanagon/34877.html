Hi All,
 I have a 74 VW  with a '73 engine and semi-auto transmission that I have been told I have to sell. 
The engine was rebuilt about 18 months ago, but turns out it was done
cheaply and badly and the mechanic has , of coures, disappeared.
 Now the engine needs a complete overhaul again and I cannot afford it.
 So, if anyone wants to take it on, my orange Bug is for sale,,sigh...
 I want it to go to a good home. It is running, but NOT well..
I live in New England and can be reached at my e-mail address...brekke_at_localnet_dot_com..
 However, if anyone can maybe SAVE my Bug from this mess, I would
be eternally grateful!
 Thanks All,
 Breck
PS my husband says..No more money into this car..sell it..
_I_ am the one who wants to save it!
