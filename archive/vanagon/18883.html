&gt;&gt;My BBB Autoline forms are due in this weekend. Would you please vanagon
&gt;&gt;owners who have/had the gasket problems send me a short mail describing
&gt;&gt;your vanagon's model/year and at which age/mileage the gasket problem
&gt;&gt;occured/repaired? 
&gt;&gt;

OK, so far there are only a few of you responded to my plea. I guess most
of you do not have the problem? 

The number of responses is too few to support me the point that it is indeed
a VW engineering problem. So it will be hard to finger point to VW for
compensation for the repair. It will be up to the arbitrator to determine
my fate.

Anyway, I managed to get an estimate from a dealer today without having to
take the engine apart. It is $2071.34 including replacement of both heads.
I don't really like to pay this much to fix it. I'll probably exchange
the westy's engine with the 84 vanagon and keep the vanagon for occasional
use or sell it or use the rest of it as parts source for the westy.

Thanks much for those who responded to help. Very much appreciated.
