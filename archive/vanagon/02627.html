Subject: front to rearcoolant pipes-starting to rust more than a bit!

Greetings,
 I was just under the van and noticed that the coolant pipes
on my van are rusting rather badly in the area in which they make the
turn  going from under the car to the engine. [In the rear}
Has anyone had to replace theirs? If so, how much should
I start socking away?
  I think I'll try some 'miracle rust converter' that
will change the rust to stainless steel. Btw, why didnt VW use stainless initially?
Bill
