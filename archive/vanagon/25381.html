Subject: AOL and the list.

I've been having a &quot;situation&quot; with AOL and was wondering if any other AOLers
having had it too.  I have been seeing mail that I've sent to the list posted
two days later and responses before postings.  I saw Martha's apology and
responses to it about 24 hours before the original posting!  Is this an AOL
only problem?  If it is, I may start to get my mail from this list on
CompuServe.
