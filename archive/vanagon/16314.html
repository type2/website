Joel,

Please be informed that I have joined the ranks of
Westy ownership. I have purchased the '86 Westy that I 
had asked questions about on Wednesday. It had received a 
clean bill of health from a VW mechanic. In this part of
Pennsylvania, motor vehicles have to pass emission testing.
The dealer put $200 into getting it to pass but it still
failed. Since more than $50 was spent they passed it.
What does this mean, it means that I got a free tune up
since I had signed an agreement of sale before the emission
test. All in all the dealer put about $1000 into getting
it through state inspection/emissions. So the purchase price
of $4100 wasn't too bad after all.

I'm looking forward to my first road trip which should be
the 2nd weekend of May. 

I've already started to wave to Splits, Buses, Vanagons &amp; Eurovans.

Thank you,
John Sharpe
'86 Westy
