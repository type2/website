&gt; ok, i have a rust paint question.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; i have a two part treatment, ones a primer and ones a stop/rust
&gt; thing  (not very technical i know).  they are both spray paint type
&gt; cans.  what happens to the existing, non rusted paint that gets one or
&gt; both of these on that area?  will it make the paint chip/crack and
&gt; fall away, or will it seal it also, until i can get to it?

The &quot;stop/rust&quot; thing (I've used Extend, seems OK, some people
really like POR-15) will stain paint and make it ugly, so watch
where you splatter it (also try not to run over a whole plastic
jar of it with your bus (don't ask how I know  :-)  )).  I don't
think it will make the paint chip or crack, BUT, if there is
rust under the paint, it won't prevent it from spreading.  A typical
bubble of rust has spread underneath normal-looking paint so
when you're sanding, make sure you get to bare metal or at least
get off all the paint you're sure is above rust.

Also there are lots of hidden areas that you can't really reach
into to sand or paint--chain saw oil or motorcycle chain lube
has been highly recommended to slow rust in these areas.
