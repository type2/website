Just got a call from the man with this EV. His asking price is now $13,500.

Subject: 	EV Ad in Seattle Times

If anyone is interested, I called about the following ad in the Times:
 '93 EURO VAN - Papers, well maint'd, loads of extras, $14,500 obo, (206) 
316-0660
It is a EV GL with 73,000 miles, (mostly highway), Automatic Transmission, 
Cruise, AC, ABS, Ungo Alarm, Bra, and 6 CD changer. He's just put in new 
front brake pads, as well as a new windsheild in June. (Too many highway 
rock chips, he said.) And it has a blue exterior, which blue, I'm not sure. 
I'd go for it myself, but I couldn't unload the Golf III in time to meet 
his deadline.

Still Looking,

Matt Dekker
