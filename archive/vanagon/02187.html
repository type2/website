Subject: Late nighter's and early risers (trip talk)

Another thing we need to consider about this trip is that
some of us will want to party till late and not want to get 
up till 12:00 noon.  Others will retire earlier and want to
get an early start.  It's a fact of life.  I think it would
be wise if we discussed the logistics of solving this dilemma.
