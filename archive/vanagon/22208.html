Subject:       Fridge and other ramblings.

I unsubscribed for a few days and just checked the flow thru the 
archives and NEED to comment.  what is it about human nature, huh?

FRIDGE:  We were camping for 3 days in Duluth, MN and had the fridge
going all the while.  I had added a 'soft margarine container'
partial shield to the exterior fridge vent and never had a blowout. 
however, i am also using a freshly 'tuned' fridge so i don't know if
it would've anyway.  haven't tried it without the shield.  temps ranged in 
the 30's at night and mid 40's during day with ambient (van
interior hotter)in the 70's.  not great performance but adequate. 

i did notice an increase in fridge temp while *driving*  with propane 
on alone.  i'm going to attribute this to the air rushing past the 
fridge vent and sucking the heat from the flame out before it got a 
chance to heat the refrigerant.  anyway, i again flicked the 12v 
power on *with* the propane and temps came back down.

i had added another cooling fan to exhaust condensor heat from the 
vertical, rectangular shaped vent on the side of the fridge cabinet.  
while the fan IS very low amp draw, i don't think it moves enough air 
to make a difference.  next step is to wire a larger fan in and have 
a separate switch to activate it instead of being tied solely to the 
condensor thermoswitch.  the interior fan continues to be a nice 
addition.

CIRCUIT BOARD REPAIR:
I haven't tried this specifically on the Vanagons but have fixed 
others.  Gently scrape away any plastic/insulative coating on the 
foil and maybe buff it with a pencil eraser.  then heat the foil with 
a tinned soldering iron and have a dab of flux on the foil.  a touch 
of solder at the break usually bridges the crack and continuity is 
restored.
