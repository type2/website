Subject: Re: Most Expensive part for its size?

&gt; cut it off)  I had two choices, either order a box of 100 from McMaster 
&gt; for about $30, or buy one from the dealer.  After paying the dealer 
&gt; $3.50 for a single bolt, I think I should have ordered from McMaster and 
&gt; found other Vanagon owners that could use the other 99 bolts.  After 
&gt; paying $7.00 for a two inch long hose Monday, I'm glad these are the only 
&gt; parts I need from the dealer for this head replacment job!

Did you actually call McMaster-Carr, I have never found a piece of 
hardware they won't break out individually even when the catalog says 
they won't split the box.  Also most cities have good 
hardware/fastener stores that can get most anything, even here in 
good ole WV.
