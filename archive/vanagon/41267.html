Subject: Re:  cruising speed

&gt;&gt;In my ignorance I've adopted the magic number of 62 mph as a
&gt;&gt;zero-headwind cruise speed, with a downshift to 3rd (and drop to 50 mph)
&gt;&gt;when I can't hold speed on a grade with less than 3/4 throttle.  This
&gt;&gt;&quot;feels&quot; safe for the engine, if feelings count for anything, but I'd be
&gt;&gt;curious as to your (and other's) opinion as to where the danger zones
&gt;&gt;start (in terms of rpm and engine load) for the wasserboxer.
&gt;
&gt;I own an 86 Vanagon syncro 160,00 on the clock. I driver to and from work,
&gt;25 miles one way.  I run between 70 and 75 most days.  If weather is bad or
&gt;windy (head wind) I run at 65.
&gt;
This is interesting...I have an 87 syncro w/83k miles.  I like to drive
under the green (4k) on the tach, pushing 80mph.  Tail-winds help out,
though!!
Does anyone have overdrive on their Vanagon (I've heard of using a Porsche
5 speed)?  It'd be neat to hear what RPM you have at this speed in fifth.
