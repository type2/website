Subject:      Mystery hoses

Hello; While I was crawling under my 87 GL trying to figure out why it's so
hard to get into first gear.  I noticed two heavily worn heater hoses
tie-wrapped to the water pipes going to the rad.   What is the purpose of
these hoses? do they go to the dash heater?  I lubricated all the bushings
that the shift rod passes through with lubri-plate, but it didn't seem to
help.  Another thing, the catch that holds the door open has loosened off,
can I replace the phillips head machine screw with an allen head machine
screw?  If so what size length?      Larry Carter
