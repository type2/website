Yup. Mine does that.  I replaced the clutch in December, but I haven't 
driven it any distance since.  On one 45 minutes trip I notcied that it 
still get's a little tough to get it OUT of gear after having been driven 
for a while on the freeway.  This does NOT happen in town no matter how 
long it gets driven. It only happens at freeway speeds.  I've not tried 
to figure out exactly why it's going wrong.  We're going down to Chicago 
at the end of this month (From Minnesota) so I'll find out if it's really 
bad still.  I've always assumed it was linkage problems because I KNOW 
I've got some seriously worn parts that are not cheap in there.
