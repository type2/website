Subject: Seneca Rocks Camping Trip - Directions


For those interested in attending this weekend's campout here are
directions from the Washington Beltway and Interstate 66.  For those who
are attending from elsewhere on the I-95 corridor, all the direction sets
I have been able to find include getting to that point and going west from
there.  From the the intersection of I-495 and I-66, the directions are as
follows:

 (1) From I-66 &amp; I-495  go west on I-66 'til it ends at I-81
     (approximately 60 miles). Note: Tom Forhan says construction
     near manassas is terrible, so he intends to take an alternate
     route.  I know not which, Tom???  Route 50??)

 (2) Go south on I-81 2 exits (approximately 4 miles) to Route 55.

 (3) Go west on Route 55 to Seneca Rocks (approximately 80 miles)

The last part of this direction set (go west on Route 55) covers a
couple of splits/combinations and doglegs which I will describe below,
but remember, whatever else the road says, what you are trying to do is
follow Route 55!

Detail for Route 55:

After you pass into West Virginia, Rt 55 will be joined by Rt 259 just
before Wardensville,  Rt. 259 departs on the left 20-30 miles down the
road just past Baker.  Ignore it.

When you get to Petersburg, Rt 55 joins Rt. 220.  At the center of town
turn right onto what should be 220/55 (but is probably only labelled Mount
View Street).  As you leave town, the road splits.  The right fork is
labelled Rt. 42, the left fork is labelled Rt. 55 and Rt. 28.  Take the
left fork. STAY ON RT. 55.

Follow Rt.55/Rt.28 to Seneca Rocks.  The campground entrance is just south
of town.

Lastly, 
I HATE JAVA!!!  This is my third try at generating this post, and I am so
sick of java that, the next event I hope to arrange is a necktie party for
the developers.  I am also willing to invite the individuals at Netscape
who decided that it was so &quot;cool&quot; that it had to be included in Netscape
WITHOUT A WAY TO TURN IT OFF!
