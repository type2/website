Howdy all!
I returned from my week's paid vacation to find a full mailbox,
including many praises for the shirts.
Thanks !!!!!
I'm glad you all like them. If you haven't gotten yours yet, don't
worry- you know how the mail is. 
As a curiosity, you probably noticed the shirts were actually sent
first class, and the multiple shirts even priority mail. As I mentioned,
my parents do a lot of mailing, and had all the postal charts at the
house. It turned out that first class and even priority were only a few
cents more expensive, but A LOT faster. Also, they don't forward or
return third class.
Anyway, I hope everyone enjoys them. I am really considering another
run, say in the early spring time. I will post more about that as the
time rolls around.
Thanks again
Richard
