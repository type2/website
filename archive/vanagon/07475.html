&gt;Huh? Huh?

well, i thought about that, but decided that aol_dot_com and compuserve_dot_com
etc. kinda really didn't have anything 'in common' ... it's not like you
worked together or went to school together. or something. but there was
 a whole bunch of them. :)  at first i was gonna do ALL the _dot_com, but that
was way too many. same with _dot_gov and extremely too much _dot_edu.

the biggest problem is that the addresses vary so much, that they don't
sort together correctly.
