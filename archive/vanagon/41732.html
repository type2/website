Subject: Rear Suspension Question
Date: Thu, 9 May 1996 17:33:41 -0700

I have a fairly loud and annoying squeek coming from the rear of the Westy
(77). I think I've narrowed it down to the rubber suspension busheson the
spring plate covering the torsion bar. Question...Can I remove the spring
plate bearing cover without affecting anything else, lube the bushing (lube
to use?) and replace the cover no problem? The Haynes Manual is a little
vague about this, and I haven't touched rear suspensions before, but like I
said it's a REALLY annoying sound, and I can tell it's coming right from
that area. Any help greatly appreciated!   Thanks, Tom
