Subject: Bus connections, f/

Listening to the radio this AM, story of a Japanese couple trying to 
immigrate to Canada, which they had done successfully 21 years ago.
   Left Japan after two years of visa etc. application, to try and gain 
entry from a Commonwealth country, England.  Flew to Germany, two kids &lt;6 
years old. Decided to buy a Volks camper to live in, then drove to England, 
lived in England for 1.5 years, waiting for visa etc.  No luck, so they 
returned to Germany etc and toured for another 6 months.
  Tried again, got an interview, interviewer looked like &quot;JC Superstar&quot;.  He 
asked what they had been doing since they left Japan, 'living in a VW bus 
for 2+ years&quot;  A 35 minute talk ensued between JC and husband on nothing but 
the van and life in it.  At the end of which JC stamped the papers and rec'd 
they be allowed to immigrate! &lt;g&gt;  They put the bus on a ferry to Montreal, 
arrived safely and drove across Canada til the end of the road, Vancouver, 
where they were being interviewed on radio this AM. Patience is a virtue, as 
is a VW bus!
Bet it was a splittie too.
