Subject: Summary on Tire Comments, etc


hey now,

the following is what i've heard so far on tires...specifically the 
185/80r14 that i'm considering:

1) They'll do fine go for it.
2) Will fit perfectly since it's close to the original tire size (185/82/r14)
3) they'll be fine as long as they are rated at 1500 pound carrying 
capacity.
4) this size won't fit.
5) they will over-rev your engine on the highway and your better going 
with a 195/75 or 205/70.
6) they are too skinny.

heheheh where do i go from here?
