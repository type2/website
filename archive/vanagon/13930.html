Man, did I have this problem!!

Here's my .02:

'70 and earlier use the t/o bearing that has a raised ring in the 
center.  This mates with the 3-arm p.p.  You'll notice (I didn't notice 
what year bus you own) that you have no sleeve (on yer trans.).  

'71 and later use a sleeved-transmission shaft with the smooth-faced t/o 
bearing.  This mates with the multi-splined &quot;porsche-type&quot; p.p.

I had a couple &quot;professional&quot; mechanics tell me there was no diff. and 
that any combo. would work.  They were wrong.  

My pertinent (&amp;possibly boring) story:

Put '72 KG motor into '70 Kombi.  Have to really torque the clutch cable 
(1st warning sign) to get OK clutching (old t/o, new p.p.).  After a 
while, the clutch fork snaps.  Replace it, and put new-style t/o to match 
p.p.  Serious clutch probs, like next-to-no clutch.  Eventually, I realize 
the problem, replace t/o and p.p. both with old style.  
Result:  perfect clutching.


Good luck, and happy bussing!!  (&amp; good luck with p.o'ed SO)
