&gt; Gosh, Tim, you seem to be having really rotten luck
&gt; w/ your EV.  The symptoms sound like the same thing
&gt; that happened w/ a '84 GTI I once had; it'd cut out,
&gt; you'd tow it to wherever, and, unbelievably, it'd
&gt; start right up like nothing had happened.  One of
&gt; those freaky heat related things I guess.  Anyway,
&gt; like you, the dealer started replacing the entire
&gt; electronic ignition system and I think the problem
&gt; got fixed when they replaced the Hall sender.


Hm.  I'll have to remember that.  My 80 Westy had a bad Hall sender once.
Did something like that, but before it failed it was preceded by steadily
declining gas mileage, to about 16mpg when it finally died.  The EV has
been steadily getting 20-21.  I had just put it's first tank of regular gas
in the day before, but can't believe that's my problem.  Manual says it
should burn the stuff okay.  Been running ethel since it was new, though.

&gt; Anywho, I too, have little excitement to report on
&gt; the EV transmission front; and this after a couple
&gt; years' worth of occaisional spastic clutch-gas-
&gt; brake footwork by a couple of owner/drivers.

I take it this means you've had no trouble?  Congrats, if so!

&gt; I finally had to replace my original windshield wiper
&gt; inserts last week...does that count?   ;-)

Nope, sorry 8^)
