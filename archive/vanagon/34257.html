Subject: Cold MN Effects on Clutch?
Date: Wed, 31 Jan 96 19:09:00 PST


Hi folks, I'm still off the list, but in need of advice.  Tonight's minus 15 
(or so) Minneapolis weather seems to have taken the life of my clutch ('84 
Vanagon).  There is no resistance at all when I depress the pedal.  Once 
during the past two evenings, I noticed my clutch seemed to be partially 
frozen.  I got some resitance only when I pressed the pedal much farther 
down than it usually seem to begin to catch (did that make sense).  So it 
may be frozen: I usually put it in gear after I've turned it off, so the 
last thing I did was depress the clutch pedal to park it.  I just rolled 
over 100,000 miles, so it could have snapped too.    I'm wondering if anyone 
on the Vanagon list has experienced subzero effects on their Vanagon clutch, 
or any other part of the beast.  Since I'm off the list, please respond 
directly....

Thanks in advance, and happy winter!
