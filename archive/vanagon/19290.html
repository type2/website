Subject: hydraulic clutch

Does anyone have words of wisdom about clutch problems?  The slave
cylinder was leaking, so we installed new seals.  We can't seem to
bleed the system.  We get a small amount of fluid spraying out the
bleeder valve, but it behaves as if the master cylinder seals have gone
bad as well.  Next step seems to be to replace the seals in the master
cylinder.  Any advice on this problem?
