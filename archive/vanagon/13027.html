So Chris Arai, Arai Design says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to make a parking brake on an 84 Vanagon do anything 
&gt; besides take up floor space?  
&gt; 

Sounds like you need your rear brakes adjusted.  They have to be adjusted
several times to get the parking brake to work correclty.  Don't forget
to bleed them too.
