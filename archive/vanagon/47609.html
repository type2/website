Subject: Re: EV piston slap

Hi Chris,

First, I must tell you that the 93 Eurovan is the best van I've ever owned.
It's high-torque performance is a pleasure to drive. Perhaps the best
description I've read described it as a &quot;highway locomotive.&quot; It is
extremely comfortable to ride in for long distance trips and handles like it
is on rails. I love this car.

Piston slap occurs in some EVs. If the engine sounds like a diesel when
first started in the AM, then it is a likely candidate. It will sound loud
and &quot;diesel-like&quot; for about 20-30 seconds when started from a stone-cold
condition. You'll know if it's there. If it is, VW ought to repair this
condition for free under the 50,000 mile power train warranty. My dealer
replaced the pistons at no cost. After replacing the pistons, the loud,
metallic, &quot;diesel&quot; like sounds went away. I am not the original owner of
this EV either. It had _at_ 25k miles and was about 2 years old.

Piston slap is supposed to affect the long-run wear of the engine (so I've
been told). Others on the list are probably more knowledgeable about this
condition and its long term effects.

Good luck with your shopping. Once again, the EV is an outstanding vehicle.
Greatly undervalued in my opinion.

&gt;Hi, 
&gt;I am new to the group and am interested in finging out some maintenance 
&gt;information on a '93 EV.  We are in the process of buying one (31K miles) 
&gt;and in scanning some of the older threads in the forum noticed a few 
&gt;problems.  The one problem which I was not familiar with was piston slap 
&gt;and I was wondering if someone could explain the problem and describe 
&gt;the symptoms. 
&gt; 
&gt;Any other thoughts on the '93 would be appreciated. 
&gt; 
&gt;Thanks,
