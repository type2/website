Subject: Re: Throttle valve positioner


&gt;It's supposed to hold the throttle open when deceleration, and has two hose 
&gt;connections to it. One is bigger, I think that this goes to the manifold for 
&gt;vaccum.  the other goes to the carb?  There are 2 hose connections on the 
&gt;carb, where does the other one go?

The thing is used for emmisions control.  It is supposed to keep you from
running too rich when decelerating with the engine (downshifting), and
reducing smog.

Put a nail in the other end of the hose.
