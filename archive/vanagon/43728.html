&gt;I also noticed for the first time in replacing the tin what a sizable hole
&gt;the slot for the oil filler tube presents. This of course opens directly
&gt;under the fan and feeds hot air right off the muffler. I'm going to tape it
&gt;off as I am other holes but wonder if originally there was a rubber grommet,
&gt;or the like, sealing or at least reducing this gap?

Yep, there's supposed to be a grommet there (mine's missing too).  VAG

Never been asked for 'em.  Dealer still has available for 2.85 (They have a
new Price list out effective June 1, so it may have changed).
