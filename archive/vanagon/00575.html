Subject:      FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) ... what do you want?

as i was stealing Hank's account of radiator testing, i got to thinking:
just what exactly does everybody want in a FAQ??? and should we have a
FAQ for T1 buses, another for T2 buses, T3, and T4 buses? or by engine
types (1950-1971, 1972-1983, 1983.5-1991, 1992-?)? or what?

anybody have any suggestions/desires/complaints/needs? i'm open to opinions.
(one of these days, i'll learn to keep my mouth shut!) :)

i haven't been putting the key stuff and the electrical stuff in the FAQ
cause there hasn't been any real definitive how-you-do-this kinda stuff.
but that's cause that's the sort of stuff *I* would expect in a FAQ: how do
i fix this, etc.

anyway, here's another topic for discussion, thrown to the wolves, as it were.
