Subject: Re: Parts from the Bus Stop

along a similar thread.........

lee's question hot me thinking......

i am in the process of replacing all of the locks (rear hatch, cargo door,
and both front doors) on my 65' westy from donor parts from another 65'.
(don't ask why, it's a long story)

my question is this,

&quot;is it possible to seperate the push button locking mechanism from the
handle on the exterior *front* door handles (driver's and passenger)?&quot;

in other words i want separate the lock cylinder from the pull handle on
the exterior passenger and driver's door. Do i make sense? Are the handle
and lock a one piece unit or can they be separated?

also, does anybody know where you can get the original VW keys for the
exterior handles for my 65'? you know the chrome plated keys that have the
&quot;VW&quot; logo in the head of the key?

any replies much appreciated

&gt;     hi Bus-Stop fans,
&gt;
&gt;     I have also got their catalogue and it looks good - and they seem nice
&gt;     and helpfull when you call. They seem quite happy about sending stuff
&gt;     to the UK.
&gt;
&gt;     One question though...
&gt;
&gt;     I like the look of their -&gt;'67 chrome bus door handles and I just
&gt;     wondered if anyone has seen/bought any chrome handles off them. I
&gt;     assume that the handles are reproduction ones at that price (25$ each)
&gt;     about I just wondered about the quality and its not clear whether the
&gt;     handles are actually chrome or not - I've heard that they are painted
&gt;     black.
&gt;
&gt;     anyone know,
&gt;
&gt;     Lee.
