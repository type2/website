	Thom Fitzpatrick, thanks, but a 56 missing proper tail-lights,
one windsheild and seats doesn't really sound like a turn-key solution.

	Joel Walker, THANK YOU for the good information. It goes in
my binder, with your name gratefully mentioned. Smooth roads and clear
skys for you forever!

	Andy Erskine, wow! But this sounds consistant with the front-end
wreck my mother had in our family 68... there wasn't much damage to the
VW and it could be driven after.

	John Richie, drunks and the drugged are usually limp and survive
the impacts that kill their victims. With a 50 MPH limit, its possible
that the impact speed between the two vehicles was over 100 MPH... that
anyone survived is amazing. I'd rather not be in a bad front end collision,
and I guess it would be worse in a bus than some. But I remember reading
that many deaths occur in conventional cars when the drivetrain gets
pushed into the passenger compartment- that's not a problem with a Bus.

	All
	I got NEATO (North East Association of Transporter Owners) info
yesterday and they mention a sister-group, LiMBO (Late Model Bus
Organization). I think I'll join both for a year and see what happens.

	Cheer!
	Bill Abbott
