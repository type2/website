Subject: Re: Original Colors for a 67 TII


&gt;Does anyone out there know the stock color offerings for 1967 Type II's?
&gt;In particular, a friend of mine needs to know the different color 
&gt;combinations for his recently acquired Deluxe Sunroof.

Two that I know are Sea Blue/Cumulus White and Titian Red/Pearl White(?).
I'll double check my books and get back with you.
