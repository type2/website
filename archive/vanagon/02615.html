Anyone who rebuilds the Solex carbs that came with the '72 and '73 buses 
should probably seek professional help. Either the Dellarto or Weber kits 
are fine (I have Dellartos in my '72) and give the ol' Velveeta wagons 
good power.

The best advice I can give on jetting is to find a mechanic you trust and 
let him/her fiddle with the adjustments for a few days. Admittedly, this 
can get a little pricey -- $150-200 if the bus stays for a week -- but I 
had a thorough job done two years ago and a recent Unisyn check still 
showed good-enough air/fuel adjustment. Yeah, it's a couple of bills to 
get this done, but it beats new car payments.

Like stereos and computers, though, buses show other weaknesses after 
adding new components. All that great new power may put a strain on other 
parts, so be judicious about flooring it.

I know that some people advocate replacing the dual-carb setup with a 
single Weber kit. Any comments on this to make this thread a little more 
lively?
