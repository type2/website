Subject: Re: That '87 for sale in Los Banos

I don't know the proper nomenclature, I guess.  This thing was a Westfalia
pop-top, a full-width bench seat/bed in the back, Wofsburg logos, a
little removable refrigerator behind the passenger seat, and a funky
rear-facing seat behind the driver, with a storage compartment under it.
A table folds against the wall on the driver's side.

So what is it?  Many others have this arrangement, with some reporting only
the studs left on the floor where the reefer went.

&gt; &gt;&gt;He's asking $7900, and the place is called &quot;Foreign Auto&quot; in Los Banos.
&gt; &gt;&gt;The owner (Steve?) was real nice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Westfalia Weekender??  If this has a poptop, rear bed/bench and two rear 
&gt; &gt;facing single seats it's a Multivan. Excellent choice, all the Westy stuff 
&gt; &gt;you need without the price!! Add a full kitchen later if you happen upon a 
&gt; &gt;deal. $7900 seems a bit high those repairs total $500 +/-.
&gt; 
&gt; VW didn't introduce the Multivan model in the USA until 1990.   Did they have
&gt; them in Canada before that?
