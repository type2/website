&gt; After 18 months  he told the dealer that some day they were going to screw up
&gt; and sell a car to some one who wasn't big enough to push it where he wanted
&gt; to go and he sold it for $6500. In a patriotic fit he went and bought a new
&gt; Granada.
&gt; 

Ya know, responses like this on the list really irk me.  I've seen many brands
foreign and domestic have these same kinds of symptoms and repetitive problems
and repeat visits to the garage/dealership with no resolution of the problem.
One such example is Thom Fitzpatricks trouble with his SO BMW last year.

Other examples can be found just by looking at the recall lists for current
vehicles.  

To label one specific car as being a lemon or unfixable is pure bullshit.
The problem really lies with finding a good mechanic that can appropriately
diagnose and locate the problem.  If you are getting the service done at
a dealership, then fine, then they should honor their warranty and fix
the car.  If not, then elevate the issue.  But don't blame the car just
because there are incompetent people working on it.

I realize the Vanagon has some inherent engineering problems but I'll bet
that the Granada does too.  Be sure to post those too.  I know, I have
a friend that has owned one.  So they must all be bad.....
