Subject: Shiften again &amp; Oil light a buzzing!

Thanks for the advice etc. on my broken stick shift. I put in a used one
in( someone up here in Montana rolled an 86 synchro recently). The new
shifter feeels very different. If I shift from 3rd to 2nd it goes over
into the reverse and granny low area, but wont slip into the gear unless
I push down. Is this normal?  Can I adjust somewthing. i don't remember
my old shifter doing this.
Also my oil light buzzer dance is happening again! yikes. Mostly it
happens as I decelarate at about 2100rpm. I've read some of the
descriptions of this system and I still don't understand the system.Do
any of you know if there are oil pressure guages that might fit,  say
down near the diff. lock switch?  Thanks again &amp; in advance....Rob
