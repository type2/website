Subject: Clicking in Wheels - Ideas of why?

OK, so now I got another wierd thing going on with my '86 Westy.
It is a heavy clicking that seems to be comming from the wheel(s) that is 
rotational (it speeds up when I do) and then goes away when there appears 
to be enough rotational speed to keep whatever it is in place. This is 
not a heavy metal sound, but neither does it sound &quot;tinny&quot;.
 
An enterprising allignment shop wants me to believe that it is wheel 
bearings that need packing, and it may be, but it sure sounds more lke 
something that is loose at one end and swings when I slow down.

Who has run into this before and knows what I am hearing - more 
importantly, how to cure it and is it  important to track down and fix 
right now?

Thanks - Jack
