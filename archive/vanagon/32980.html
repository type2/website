Subject:       Wet Feet-Fiberglass or Weld

Last week I sent a posting with the comment that I constantly looking 
for busses I don't need.  You're right, I do need, and will buy more.  


I also described my current problem with the two 1 inch holes in 
the bottom corners (under the gasket) of my bay window 
windshield frame.  I did't get any advise on this, but I am 
desperately wanting to do the repair soon.  Is this a fiberglass or 
weld repair?  Fiberglass would be easier. however I'm concerned that 
the build up of material will cause an poor gasket seal.  Any 
recommendations? 

I was also told I should paint my camper top because it is weathered 
badly and will deteriorate if its not painted soon.  Does this make 
sense?  Original color appears to be off-white. Is there a color 
code for the camper top?
