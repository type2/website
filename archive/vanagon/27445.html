Subject: Re: The Forever Car (or Bus)


&gt;&gt; cars themselves don't pollute.....but the generating plants
&gt;&gt; that develop the power to re-charge these vehicles do!
&gt;
&gt;One source said that the amout of lead produced will far exceed that
&gt;produced before unleaded gas!


Any reason to believe that source knows what it's talking about?
