So David Carment says:

&gt; Pardon me for intruding, but what makes a syncro great and desireable?
Well, I can only go on what I've heard. 
&gt; Does it handle better in the snow/rain/mud?
&gt;From what I've heard, yes.
&gt; Is fuel economy better or worse?
Probably a little worse.
&gt; Does it ride smoother?
I doubt it.
&gt; Does it handle better?
I presume you mean tight corners.  Probably about the same.
&gt; Will it go off road?
Need you ask?
&gt; Is it expensive to repair?
Need you ask??
&gt; Is it peppier?
I don't see how with the identical engine.
&gt; 

I think if you wanted to do more off-roading with your camper,
that it would be more desirable to have the syncro.  I also
think the resale value of the 2 wheel camper retains it's 
value quite well too.  The Vanagon Camper is a very unique
vehicle for it's price range in either 2 wheel or Syncro.  Since
they are not being sold brand new anymore and since the EV version
is so much more expensive, I would imagine that it is a very 
attractive deal.  I've had several people ask me if I would be
interested in selling mine.  To me, that's quite a complement.
I've never had anyone ask me about selling any other vehicle I've
owned other than my '68 bug.
