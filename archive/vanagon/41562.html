&gt; 1) The area I live in has an average speed limit of 60 km/hr. I'm not sure

&gt; wether its better to drive in 3rd. I assume (ass u me)
&gt; that second would be better but would like some conformation.

The max. shift points should be little orange lines on your speedometer.
The air cooled Vanagons have the shift point for 2nd-&gt;3rd at about 55km/hr.
The owners manual for my '77 tells me the max speed for each gear, and also
the 'most effecient speed range' for each gear.  

So, I'd say use 3rd for 60kph, but I don't know what kind of gearing you
have if it's a water cooled van. But remember that normally you'll consume
less fuel at slower engine speeds.

&gt; 2) I have this mystery plug in that is inbetween the cigarette lighter and
&gt; the right side vent. Its obviously some sort of add on but I cant even tell
&gt; what kind of plug it is. It's quite weird. It seems that the plug has both
&gt; male and female characteristics. Its a 1/4 plug slot with a small nipple
&gt; sticking out, yet it also has part of a RCA housing inside. Any clues?

Sounds like the DIN socket... also known as 'the silver socket' on this
list. :)  I found some plugs in Germany that will work in both kinds of
sockets.
