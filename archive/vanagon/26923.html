Subject: fluttering oil pressure light

My '85 vanagon with 150 K had a head gasket job last February.  Aside from that
not holding, a few weeks after the job was done, the oil pressure light began 
doing this thing where it would flutter when idling or when slowing down with
the clutch depressed (after driving for a few miles).  The local VW dealer said
to try 20W50, which I did to no avail.  Well, now I'm redoing the heads myself,
and am wondering if there's something I should look for to correct the oil
pressure problem.  Any ideas?
