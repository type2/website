&gt; Mark (1980 was a good year for America)
&gt; 
I'm not exactly sure what all this nonsense is about, and I realize this 
is the Vanagon mailing list, BUT, everytime I think about what happened in 
1980 in the United States (Canada, Mexico, and the rest are America, too) I 
get vaguely sick to my stomach and pale.

As Jimmy Carter is off in the Balkans doing the things Ex-presidents 
should be doing, I really don't much care to be reminded on this list of 
1980.  If your outtahere, Mark, thanks for being there.
