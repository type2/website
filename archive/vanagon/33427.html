Subject: Refrig.

Can anyone give me any ideas of where or how I could get the refrig. in an
82 Westie to function properly?  The pilot light glows through the sight
lens, but no cold.  I have tried it on the AC side too, with no luck.  The
brand name of the unit is &quot;Dometic&quot;.  RV dealers in the area want to to
replace the unit with one of theirs ($800 or more).

Thanks,
