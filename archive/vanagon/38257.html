Today I installed the new water and power ports as well as a new faucet to
replace the one the PO had managed to screw up along with some of the water
lines. All looks good but the pump won't switch on.

I've tested the pump itself and the switch in the new faucet works . The fuse
just prior to the pump is good. The led indicator panel shows a full tank and
good battery. Is there a water level switch of some sort independent of the
led indicator that would normally switch off the pump when the tank is empty
but could now be malfunctioning ?

My thought is that I'm not getting power to the faucet switch in the first
place. That power line just emerges from the side wall and I have no idea
what its source is. The Clymer manual indicates that it is an off shoot of
the refrigerator wiring. Am I overlooking something obvious/easy? If I do
need to get behind the cabinet can someone give me some guidance as to how to
pull the cabinet to get behind it. 

I sort of suspect that this is an old problem that motivated some PO to
tamper with the faucet and water lines in the first place. Therefore it's
possible that something that is supposed to be there in the way of wiring,
isn't.

Thanks in advance for any help,

Weston
