The van has been missing from Strausbaugh's lot for a week now. Of 
course, they may have just taken it camping or a trip. They do that from 
time to time.
The VWs they sell are now spread out over what used to be the floor of 
the building they dismantled. Bugs, Ghias, a Fastback...some nice VWs, 
but they always want such high $$ for them and they never budge on a 
price.
I'll keep a lookout for the return of the van, if it hasn't sold.

&gt;My apologies to everyone wanting information on this Vanagon.  I stopped
&gt;in to see it Saturday afternoon about two and there wasn't a soul
&gt;around.   I was going to stop in on my way back to MD on Monday but, the
&gt;Vanagon was not there.  I don't know if it's sold or not.
&gt;	Chances are that it is not sold and will not be sold at the $6000
&gt;asking price.  The body is in good shape.  The engine may be a little
&gt;tired.  The oil doesn't smell good and is quite thin.  The coolant
&gt;resevoir was dry.  These signs do not bode well for the heads.
&gt;	There are a couple of small dings in the doors and a very strange worn
&gt;mark on the front.  The undercarriage looks good and rust free.  The
&gt;interior is a little dirty and used but, in great shape for a ten year
&gt;old car with 103,000 miles on it.
&gt;	I'm sorry I didn't get to check out the engine or take it for a drive. 
&gt;I won't be in PA for a couple of weeks to try again.  Maybe one of the
&gt;York locals on the list could check it out.
