Ahh but those are the things that make a vacation memorable ;-)

Good to hear you made it home.  Tell Alan we're still sporting our paper-plate-art in the rear 
window of Lief.  We're hoping that there will be some southerners coming through Vancouver 
tomorrow that we can tag along with to go down to Oregon for some surfing.  I don't suppose 
you know the whereabouts of the group do you?  Or is there even a group anymore?
