Subject: Moo is leaking Big Time!

Hello All!   Moo, my 88 Westy has a collant leak.  here's the guff.  I 
took her for her last run of the winter/fall a week ago.  800 klicks no 
sweat.  I parked the camper and didn't start her for A week.  I started 
it up last night and after the initial &quot;test&quot; blink, the flashing red 
light started to blink and wouldnt stop.  
The coolant tank was empty...  I refilled, started, and the same thing.

I just came in, after letting the engine warm up to the point where the 
indicator was at the midway point.  I had a look underneath the engine 
and coolant was leaking at a radip rate from the right side of the 
engine. FIF.

Could a bum water pump be the problem?  How can I tell ?  what should I 
look for?

Help please!!
