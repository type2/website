Subject: Curtains on a pre-68 Westy
Date: Sun, 18 Jun 1995 09:56:38 -0400 (EDT)

Hi,

Could some one puh-lease tell me how the curtains work on a pre-68
Westy?

I have 6 rods (I assume for the six square windows) but interestingly
the holes in the car don't match the holes in the curtain rods.
What secures the bottom of these curtains (if anything)?

I have nothing for the rear window at all.  What went there?

For the front window, I have a track that runs all the way around the doors
and front windows but no hooks that go in the track.  Are the hooks available?
Was the curtain completely removed when not in use?  If not, where did it bunch
up?

This is motivated by realizing towels and duct tape is not a viable alternative.

Thanks for any tips.

...Markus
