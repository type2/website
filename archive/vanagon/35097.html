&gt;Hi Gang,        
&gt;         Here we go again.  Yesterday after a day of freeway driving
&gt;         going 65-70mph steady my points (Bosch) break where the filiment
&gt;         rides on the cam.  This is the second time now in a month or 
&gt;         so...the first time was when I drove up to Monterey from LA
&gt;         again going at 65-70mph.  My '71 bus runs a fairly new stock
&gt;         distributor.  
&gt;
&gt;         Has anyone else had this problem with Bosch?  Are there better
&gt;         quality points?  I'm thinking it's time to go CDI and get rid
&gt;         of the points altogether.
&gt;

Check the instalation carefully.  This is a very rare problem.  The wire must
be getting flexed in away that it shouldn't.
