&gt; I think that if this is only happening after you do your flush and bleed
&gt; that it could just be getting &quot;normalized&quot;.  Mine did the same thing
&gt; then stayed at a normal level.  You might just want to bleed it again
&gt; just in case though.

What have you found the best way to bleed this system? I have found it challenging to say 
the least!
