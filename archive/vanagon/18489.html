Subject: bodega update 5/30


Here's the 10th hour attendee roster for Bodega Dunes, June 2-4th.  Each one 
of these posts contains the latest info, so don't assume the content stays 
constant if this looks like past posts.  I plan to make one, perhaps two more 
posts before the trip.  

As a reminder, the 2 evening meals (Friday and Saturday) as well as the 2 
breakfasts (Saturday and Sunday - special thanks to Jeff S. and Al K.!) are 
potluck.  Lunches are do-your-own as are utensils/serving things/pots/lunch/ 
booze/whatever.  REMEMBER:  Bring whichever poultry/&quot;meat&quot; you want to BBQ for 
Friday nite.  

----&gt; PLEASE NOTE!!:  It is recommended that one person in the paired groups 
(either already formed, or yet to be formed) get a reservation thru MISTIX to 
insure positive space.  Getting &quot;adjacent&quot; sites will be the trickiest part:  
check-in time for our purposes is 2 p.m.  If you cannot arrive by that time, I 
suggest giving your reservation number information to someone in our group who 
can (see arrival times posted below food concerns), so that they may save a 
good spot for you.  I'll try to phone the Dunes tomorrow to see if they can 
give us any special consideration either on arrival time and/or getting 
adjacent spots.

Remember that Jack Stafford is kindly bringing his Coleman oven (which fits 
atop a propane stove) for those of you wishing to bake.  He is also bringing 
some more homebrew:  raspberry (I think).  More &quot;transporter porter&quot; - yay 
Jack!!  

Originally, most people were bringing the same &quot;type&quot; of dish both nights, but 
this got a little disorganized for a variety of complicated reasons I won't go 
into.  Just please check below and make sure you and I both think you are 
bringing the same thing.  I'll sign up for whatever category(ies) are left.  If 
you see a question mark, please sign up or confirm with me.
