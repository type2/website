I have a story that was, at the time, somewhat disturbing.  About three years
ago I was staying with my parents while on holiday in rural Nova Scotia.  My
brother lived about 45 minutes away from my parents on the top of a small
mountain.  His house was rather &quot;off the beaten path&quot; as his nearest neighbor
was about a kilometre away.  My brother had a detached garage from his home
and he did a lot of backyard mechanicing (he owned a really old VW Beetle). 
Anyway, he was away for the weekend with his wife and kids, but he had told me
where the key to the garage was if I ever needed to get in to use his tools
and whatnot.  It was a cool, overcast July night and the wind was blowing. 
His house was nestled at the end of a long driveway and was surrounded by
large elm and maple trees.  I arrived at his house at around 10:00 pm in my
little VW Beetle which I had wanted to park in his garage and do a little work
on.  I opened the garage, parked the car and got down to work.  About twenty
minutes later, I happened to walk by one of the garage windows and I noticed a
light came on in my brother's house.  I immediately stopped what I was doing
and headed toward the house.  As I got closer, another light came on in an
upstairs window...by this time I was starting to freak!  I crept up to a
living room window and peered inside to see that the tv was on as well as a
light on a end table beside the couch, but there were no signs of anyone
about.  I went around to the front door and then the back and both were
locked.  I figured my brother and his family must have postponed their trip,
but both of their vehicles were not in the driveway!  I rang the doorbell, but
no one answered.  By this time the wind was starting to pick up and I was
strting to get just a little nervous.  I went back to the garage and put my
little Beetle back together as I didn't want to hang around anymore.  The
whole time I would occasionally stick my head outside the garage door to have
a look around.  Man that place was eerie with no moon and those big old trees
swaying in the wind!  I finally got back in my Beetle and backed out of the
garage., I noticed that the lights in the house were off as well as the glare
from the tv was gone.  I quickly left and headed bact down the mountain.  The
next day I told my parents of my unsettling evening and they told me that my
brother had a timer which he always turned on when he was on vacation.  The
timer controlled a number of lights in the house as well as the tv.  Well, I
felt a little stupid after that, but at the time it was extremely unsettling. 
All the right &quot;spooky&quot; elememts were there to scare the pants off me.
