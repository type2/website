Subject: Re: torque, rear brakes


&gt;&gt;So I measure 1.64 feet on my breaker bar and make a mark on the bar and
&gt;&gt;stand with &gt;one foot on each side of the bar, and equalize my wieght.
&gt;
&gt;Huh?  &quot;One foot on each side of the bar&quot;?  I know what you're are trying to
&gt;say, but I don't know what you mean by &quot;one foot on each side of the bar&quot;. 

&gt;This might be interpreted as one foot on the top side and one foot on the
&gt;bottom side - but you can't stand on the bottom side.  Also, if you had a
&gt;slide-handle that was centered at the socket, your words might be 
interpreted
&gt;as one foot on the left side and one foot on the right side - but this 
would
&gt;of course impart no torque.


Uh... I think he meant, &quot;one foot on either side of the MARK...&quot;

But, taken the way he did write it, wait 'till the socket slips off the nut
while you're standing astride it. Gives a whole new meaning to the term
&quot;breaker bar&quot;...       =:-()
