&gt;My wife tells me I can only end up with ONE bus so either
&gt;this one or the one I have may end up being a parts bus. 

My wife says that, too. I have another one due here Saturday.

The question becomes: How do we weasel? ;)

I can't sell the first one until I fix the ENTIRE driveline, perfectly, 
of course. And it looks way too ratty to sell--what a beater!--so I'll 
have to do something about the body and interior.

I figure I'll do the interior in teak and birch. This project should last 
me at least five years. I'm not kidding, either. ;) Couldn't get fifty 
cents for it 'til it's fixed right, sez I...
