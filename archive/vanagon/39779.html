Subject: I Buy(ed) Syncro!!!

Hello All,
	I am the person who last week asked about the validity of a 
dealer asking $11,300 dollars for an '87 Syncro Westy with 62,000 miles. 
I am happy to say that one week later, I am the proud owner of said 
vehicle.	
	The figure became better at $10,689 &quot;out-the-door&quot; without a 
trade.  I managed to keep the Volvo (which I will sell later this 
summer for a lot more than the trade-in offer) and to get a better deal. 
I left the van at my parents to keep it out of the D.C. area (where I 
live and teach) and now want to quit my job to work on it.  	
	The condition of the beast is amazing!  There are only one or 
two blemishes on the body and interior, and the engine and drivetrain 
are in fantastic shape.  It rides incredibly well and has as much 
pick-up as the Volvo.  I am impressed, because, the thing looks like a 
tank.  i never really realized how big the Syncros look; sitting a 
couple of inces higher than normal.
	I also purchased a two year extended warranty on it, and I plan 
to take full advantage of it.  I now begin my quest for parts and a 
Bentley manual.  If there is anyone out there with an extra Bentley they 
would like to part with or information on the refrigerator, sink and 
propane set-up, I would greatly appreciate knowing who you are.
	Thank-you all for your input.  It really helped me decide to buy 
it.  I'd especially like to thank:  Joel Walker, Kim Snyder, Sami 
Dakhlia, John Hathaway, Steve johnson, and all the others who had very 
helpful input.  This was my first time dealing with a dealer and the 
first auto I purchased that was over $2000.  Now I can add the &quot;'87 
Syncro Westy&quot; to my closing and to my ever expanding collection of 
VW's....I think I'll have a Ghia next.
	Anyone wanting to see my new toy, I'll be at Manassas.  By the 
way, does anyone have the phone number for pre-registration?
	Again, Thank-you all.  And I welcome any future response and/or 
help.  Also, If anyone needs help on front-wheel drive water-cooled or 
Type 1 air-cooled, I'll be glad to help.
