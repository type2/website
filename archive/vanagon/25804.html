Subject: Re: more heating ideas

&gt;I just thought I'd throw this out there for those of you with
&gt;electrical hookups in your vans.  My good friend has an 84

I have done this for about 7 years now, although with an Edison electric 
turbo heater.  It is a small round orange heater with heating elements and a 
fan inside a tube about 18 inches long.  In the winter I usually plug it 
into the Westy 110v outlet and turn it on low.  When I go in at night (if 
it's real cold) or in the morning I just plug it in.  The van stays warm and 
dry.  I stay warm until the bus heater can catch up - otherwise it never 
does during my 45 minute commute.
