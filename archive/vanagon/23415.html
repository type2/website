&gt; 
&gt;   Isn't worrying yourself about the propane in accidents &quot;pretty
&gt;     much the same&quot; as worrying about having your vehicle run on
&gt;     gasoline? 
&gt; 
&gt;   Solution? It's simple.  Don't BE in an accident!   ;
&gt; -)

Well, it depends on how cautious you want to be.  I'd rather be over
cautious than under-cautious.  For gasoline, you don't leave a leaky
line in the engine compartment or anywhere for that matter.  The fumes
just might ignite from a stray spark.  I don't care how minute the
chances, I'm still gonna fix that leak.  

For propane, I've gotta 12V DC system that keeps the food plenty cool
so I'm going to use that instead of propane which would be in the lines
which kind of exposes it to possible danger.  Well, I don't want to
take the chance, how ever small, I'm going to stay on the safe side.
It's you ass, so if you smoke yours, don't come cryin' to me or a 
lawyer.  You've been well informed.
