Subject: Heads why do they go bad?

My 86 $yncro has 110k on and I have not had any problems with the heads.  I 
hear all these horror stories about getting the heads done.  I want to know 
what causes the problem.  A long time ago someone told me it was due to 
electroysis, something to do with the water.  So I have never put any water in 
and have not had any problems yet.

Later dave
