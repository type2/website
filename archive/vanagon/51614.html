Subject: Re: 91 vanagon dripping coolant

&gt;| I noticed two drips of coolant coming from the bottom of the engine.  I 
&gt;| don't see any leaks around the filler or upper hoses.  Any advice?

	Check all your hoses on the engine. Though my van is 4 years
older, I found a couple of hoses on the rear of the engine that were oozing
coolant they leak real slow so I might only get one drip over the course of a
day, but I know it leaks, and I know I am going to have to change the hose
soon... At least it was not the heads...
