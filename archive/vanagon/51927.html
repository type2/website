Subject: Re: Diesel Westy: How slow?

Yes it's slow, about like driving the older air cooled VWs. But I don't
think it's as slow as a 1600. I also had a 1982 van and the diesel seems to
be as fast as that. It will pass over 55, about 65 tops speed though so you
have to plan ahead whne you want to pass. It's a bit of a bother sometime
when there is alot of traffic in the other lane, but we love the van.

&gt;Am looking at a diesel westy and have been reading this group for the 
&gt;past two months or so.  
&gt;
&gt;How slow is it really?  Is it like a 71-71 Westy (single carb, 1600 
&gt;aircooled?) or is it slower.  One person told me it can't pass 55.  
&gt;That seems impossible, but if true would effect my decision.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any input you are willing to send.  The one I am looking at 
&gt;has 2500 miles or so on a new engine.
