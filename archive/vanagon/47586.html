   &quot;When you open the rear hatch on the roof there is the textured
wallpaper type stuff gluded and stapled to the underside of the cabinet.
When I went and got the van it had peeled off almost all the way.  I
glued it back up after removing the rubber mouldings and had it up
pretty well but after a week it is peeling off again!&quot;

   We've all seen lots of competing spray adheasives, but I'm skeptical 
as to whether or not most would stand up to the highest temperatures 
these surfaces are likely to develop.  I remember seeing a reference to 
specifying products that hold up to an amazing 200 degrees F., and I'd 
hope this only reflects a cautious safety margin.

  Has anyone a specific product recomendation?  My new textured washable 
white-on-white wall paper is ready to replace the original covering.
