&gt; &gt; Hi folks,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I previously had.  The one I had seems to be expressly tailored to VW
&gt; &gt; dealers as the instructions and pictures indicate installation and use in a
&gt; &gt; VW.  The latest manuals I received don't mention VW and I think were meant
&gt; &gt; for a broader audience.
&gt;        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; 'Bout time us fat people had something useful catered to us. :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jack Reed did mention to me that when he called the people he talked to
&gt; &gt; (including the manager) claimed they did not have any documentation and that
&gt; &gt; they had no parts for old heaters.    
&gt; 
&gt; Uh... Is Jack fat?   Maybe that's why they didn't wanna give him one.  ;p

Nope.  Exact opposite.  I weigh the same I did in High School (6', 165 
lbs.).  _That's_ probably why I didn't get one, since they're for the 
_broader_ audience.

On a non-levity note, I'm wondering if the 800 number redirects to 
different reception centers depending on the caller's origination.  Would 
whoever called the number in the first place call them back and find out 
where they are.

&gt; 
&gt; Yup,  Friday is muvin' right along.....
