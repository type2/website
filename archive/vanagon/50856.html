Subject: Re: Side Window Needed

The archives know all and tell all (if you know how to ask):

http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives

look in the FILES at HOW-TO---Remove-Sliding-Windows

or if you want to go directly to it:

http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/Files/HOW-TO---Remove-Sliding-Windows

Haven't done the procedure, so I can't say how easy it is.

Don't have a window for you, either.

Good luck.
