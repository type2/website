&gt;
&gt;How can the &quot;outside&quot; lane be in the center of the highway?
&gt;On an upside down UK/Aussie  road, where they drive all wrong I could
imagine the 3-2 vote but not in the North American continent where we have
our &quot;oats&quot; together (except Quebque) ;) Have some Labats and sleep well.
&gt;hahahaha! (flame bait for sure!)
&gt;Rusty...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm serious. Given a four-lane freeway, or blvd, the fast lanes are the two
&gt;&gt;in the middle. The slow lanes are the ones nearest the border of the
&gt;&gt;highway.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Which are the inside lanes?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I just had a conversation in the elevator, all of us born in N Amer (3
&gt;&gt;Yanks, 2 Canucks), and the vote was 3-2 that the outside lane is the fast
&gt;&gt;lane!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Two of the voters were born and raised here in Windsor and they disagreed.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So here's a Friday question:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Which is the outside lane? The fast one? The slow one?

&gt;&gt;who's terribly perplexed and probably won't sleep tonight
