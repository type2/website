Buslady, I think your problem with the oil light/buzzer has more to do
with the pressure sensor and the hill. I had the same problem a while
back. Be sure you are using a good 15-40 or 20-50 wt oil. Actually, I've
just heard that the best oil today is 5-50 wt synthetic. And I highly
recommend that you use the Mahle or VW brand oil filter. cost a little
more, but bargains ain't always bargains

Altho I don't advocate exceeding the speed limit on off/on ramps, I
personally take them at well over the recommended speed and have never
had the light/buzzer come on. The problem I refer to above happened after
climbing a long grade.

Generally, when you have problems with oil lights or temp lights flashing
and or buzzing, check the oil/water levels. If they appear to be normal
AND the engine does not smell hot, feel excessively hot or sound hot
(loud crackling, some crackling is normal), then it is probably safe to
proceed with caution to a place where you can get professional help. To
make yourself familiar with normal engine sounds, smells, stand by your
tail gate for a minute or so after you shut down.
