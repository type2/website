I took delivery of my bus this afternoon!  Its worse than what it
looks like in the pictures, but about as bad as I figured.

This thing is a major project.  Wow.  Luckily I got some &quot;free&quot; sheetmetal
panels in the deal.

The steering wheel is next best thing to toast.  The whole rim is suburnt
so bad I don't know if I can bring it back.  Both rockers have been hacked
with metal riveted to them.  There's good surface rust around the bottom
of the windshields.  The cargo doors are icky, in fact you can only open
the forward one about half-way, because the hinge mounting is toast.

Somehow the driver's window got a huge gouge in it, which is a bummer
cause its the original large logo Sekurit glass.  All the rest of the
glass is perfect and correct.  I'm missing one slider-latch.  These
puppies are strange and different.

The cargo floor is kinda rusty but somewhat sound.  THe front floors are
gone.  Fred Flintstone kinda gone.

It has the rear seat, but the bench part is pretty rusty (hole in sunroof)
The back part (hard to get) is in OK condition.

I have the original keys.  These things are tiny!

It have the RHD pedal pan.  Hard to get bit, I'm sure...

It has lever shocks, which I have no idea how they work.  

I saw my friends '55 barndoor deluxe, which just got back from being blasted.
They blasted it with agricultural media to get the paint off, and then
glass to get the rust out.  Then they primered it with zinc etching
primer.  Man this thing looks nice!  It looks almost ready for paint, but
is actually going to spend quite a bit more time under the body hammer.
Looking at how nice his bus is, but with how much its going to need kinda
makes me depressed....  I'm so far away its not even funny...  

This blasting thing is the trick.  His bus looks so clean
now, even all the mechanicals underneath are perfectly spotless.

Tomorrow I'm going to take a full complement of pictures, prolly 2 rolls
worth or so.
