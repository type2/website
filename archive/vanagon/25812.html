So Maher, Steve says:

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The side of the coffee can says to use 2 1/2 heaping scoops.
&gt; &gt;Just what the heck is a half a heaping scoop?   :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It's a heai     scc    , of course!
&gt; 

How do you know?  It could be a 'ping-oop'  :O   ;p   ;) 

Course, I just usually pour the whole can in each time.
WHOOOOoooaaah, that caw-fee is mighty stwong-ga!!
