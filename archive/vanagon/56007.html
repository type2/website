Subject: Clarification on non-GL Campers 

I am in the market for a Vanagon Westi camper and I am very interested in the following 
configuration:

  - Pop top with double bed
  - Full width rear seat, with storage, that converts into bed
  - Rear facing single jump seat behind driver, with storage
  - Removable 12VDC/120VAC cooler behind front passenger
  - Closet behind rear seat
  - Shelving over rear cargo area, which may contain AC

Am I right that:

  1) This configuration is common in base (non-GL) Westfalia conversions?
  2) There are two versions of non-GL campers, Wolfberg and standard, and that the only
     difference is basically seat cover fabric and maybe some minor details?
  3) The interior of the standard non-GL camper holds up better than the Wolfberg's?

For what model years is the above configuration available?

Does the name of this configuration change with the model year?

I would appreciate clarification on these things, so that I know what models to look for.

Thanks.
