Subject: I need a 1600 shortblock or longblock

Howdy there. Well, my resurrection of the 67 camper is not going so well. We
pulled the engine last night, and were tearing it down, and discovered much to
my dismay that while the heads were in good shape, there was over 1/8&quot; of
endplay in the crankshaft, and the case had already been bored out to .0060 (or
whatever the third bore numbers are)
  So, I suddenly need at least a shortblock, or really even a longblock, as i
can sell my heads if need be. I would really like to go ahead and get a new
case and all, but the cost is rather prohibitive. So, anyone know of the best
place to get new cases and such from? I have seen prices ranging from
$300-$400, with my local shop having (naturally) the highest of the prices.
I would also happily trade my '65 single cab for a suitable engine...
I just want a single port 1600, and I don't even really need a bus case, just a
beetle case.
Oh well,
thanks
