Subject:      Re: Kayak roof rack

I am a new list member &amp; I'm glad I finally have something to contribute.
Yakima roof racks are excellent &amp; do have tower rack &quot;feet&quot;.  Another
equally good manufacturer is Thule (pronounced &quot;toolie&quot;), a Swedish
company.  They can also be found at bike &amp; ski shops.   Thule has a super
tower foot that, I believe, is 11&quot; tall.  This is approx. 3&quot; taller that
what Yakima offers.  Both Yakima &amp; Thule offer kayak mounts that are called
cradles, padded semicircular mounts that can be adjusted to the width of
the kayak.  Their other carrier is called a stacker, which lets you stack
multiple kayaks on their sides between vertical bars.
