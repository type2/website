Subject: Re: online air-cooled junkyard?

Tom wrote...
&gt; A friend/partner of mine just dragged in a 70-ish Sundial--this brings the
&gt; number of air-cooled's in his backyard to about 45.  Nothing really
&gt; special, but lots of good parts.  It has occured to me that an on-line
&gt; junkyard might be a viable side-line business.  Fenders and such would be
&gt; out of the question because of shipping costs. However, small chrome
&gt; trinkets and the like could be shipped very reasonably.  My thought is to
&gt; set up a web page with photos of the yard and when a request for a part
&gt; comes in, to take a digital photo of the part in question and email it back
&gt; along with pricing info.  I would try to keep Greed under control and keep
&gt; prices cheap.  What do you all think?  Should I forget it? Should I buy a
&gt; digital camera tommorow?  Would you shop on-line?   What am I forgetting? 
&gt; Any and all comments would be greatly appreciated.          

I feel this would be a great service, but doubt if it would pay for itself.
As a sideline, it may add to the bottom line, but I doubt if you would get
enough business to make it a full-time endeavor.
