Well much to my surprise, I got the propane burner on the fridge working!! I
had floowed everone's different suggestions (thanks!!), and had tried the
day before hooking up a cheap electric air pump (the kind which plugs into
the cigarette lighter, which came w/ a plastic cone shape piece used for
putting air into inflatable toys, rafts etc.).

The electronic pump forced air through the drain pipe and into the
combustion chamber. The day before, I was able to get the flame to light (a
level of achievement I never reached before hooking up the pump), but the
flame just wouldn't stay on. I gave up for the night.

Came home from work yesterday, and just for the hell of it, I held down
button B, and with ONE push I was able to light the stove! It ddn't stay lit
, but after briefly attaching the pump again, it lit, and kept burning for
hours, properly cooling the fridge!!

I guess there was gunk or something in the chamber which initialy the air
pump helpedto clear, and the lighting of the flame burned away whatever
other minor stuff was obstructing the gas or oxygen.

In any case, I guess one of the lessons I learned (and I know this has been
said before) is that air is THE most important factor in lighting the stove.
More gas DOES NOT get the fridge to light (in fact I was amazed at how short
a time I needed to hold down button B before clicking on A). 

Well once again, the common, etheral intelligence which is the internet
solves another problem!! Thanks for all the input (and the resources on Tom
Forhan's web site for Syncro Westies!!).

If anyone would like more specific details bout what worked for me please
let me know..
