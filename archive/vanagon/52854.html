 i had a quick question about how i loose power on my 86 vanagon(terrorist
 van). and was told i loose power after warm up due to a bad O2 sensor. so i
 decided to call up my local supplier for the part and he says 140.00 for a
 new one. i told him id let him know. then icalled my second option and they
 said for 70.00 they would show me how to wire a &quot;generic O2 sensor&quot; in place
 of the oem part. my question is what is so special about this oem sensor? is
 it a 3 wire heated unit or just something with a fancy plug and price tag? 
  &gt;&gt;
Theoretically, the parts operate the same and they should be interchangeable.
 I've done this for years.  lately however, I''ve been having problems with
the non bosch sensors failing early.  Especially in wet weather.  I believe
part of the problem may that the non bosch sensors hae a smaller diameter
body so the little shield can not be attached.  I now use only bosch sensors
on the vanagon.  Beck arnley sells a universal sensor that is bosch.  It has
worked well so far.  Comes with crimps and shrink tube to make reliable
connections.
