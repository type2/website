Hi all - 
        Thanks for all the kind and sympathetic responses (except the guy
who replied to me directly and called me a dumb ass!) to my whiny post last
Friday.  I was really just trying to inject some levity for Friday.
Although the first couple of weeks were scary, I'm really devoted to the
BrownBeast now and have some great mechanics (Smitty's, in case anyone ever
needs help in Gainesville, FL). 
        For those who are interested in the competitiveness in acquiring
Westy's (etc.) here in Florida, the seller had advertised it in the
AutoTrader-RV and had gotten 72 phone calls by the time I bought it.  One
guy had wired him $2,000 with the offer to buy it sight unseen.  One guy
offered him more than his asking price.  But remember, he had advertised it
as having only 35K miles.   I had already been looking for almost a year so
I felt compelled to jump on it (I got there first) even with its
questionable aspects.  I may have been hasty but the deed is done and it's
great to have this list as a 'support group'.  
        Sorry to Bob (whoever He is) if this is 'drivel'.
