&gt; 
&gt; For Santa Cruz county, in California, it lists Volks Cafe, 1823 Soquel
&gt; Avenue, Santa Cruz.  
&gt; 
&gt; Is anyone familiar with this establishment?  Is it really VW-oriented?
&gt; If so, perhaps we should have a group bash there...

	The Volks cafe is a repair shop, and a fairly popular one from 
all of the license plate covers here in town.  I have just moved to Santa 
Cruz and have not had to take my '79 bus in yet.  But when (not if) I do 
I will let you know about the service.
	And to all those who want to do some sightings, driving around 
the Santa Cruz and Capitola area my dad and I spotted an estimated 
80-100 Busses on Sunday.
