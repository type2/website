&gt;Does anybody know how to maintain the Vanagon's capability as a
&gt;5-person people mover and yet enjoy the go-anywhere-anytime freedom
&gt;of those wonderful Westy's?  I'm thinking specifically of fitting a
&gt;jumpseat behind the forward passenger's seat, as is done (on both
&gt;sides) in some of the late Wolfsburg Edition Vanagons.

someone else mentioned campers that came with a 2-seat bench in the middle.
i had experimented with my middle 2-seat bench, and if i pulled it all the
way over to the sliding door, there was almost two feet between the seat
and the driver's side wall. in order to get the seat to stay there, i'd have
to drill new holes for the four small bolts that hold the seat to that big
metal rail ... and probably flip the rails around (so more of the rail was
nearer to the sliding door) ... and do something about the  carpet/mat.
but it 'should' be possible to put the seat in there. but, like someone else
said, you'd likely not be able to open the fridge/cabinets.

but are you planning on SLEEPING all 5 of these munchkins inside the bus?? :)
i mean, family togetherness is one thing, but THAT would be more like 'cruel
and unusual punishment'!

p.s. i'm pretty sure the floor holes for the bolts (that hold the seat rails
to the floor) are there in all the buses, even the panel vans. anybody want
to check their panel van? :)
