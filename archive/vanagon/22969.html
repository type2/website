Subject: old songs that kids don't know (F)

(Friday fun)

Ode to Billie Joe evolved into a thread between Busgirl Martha and I in
which I tried to explain how nobody in the dark ages could figure out the
lyrics to Louie, Louie by the Kingsmen but every garage band mumbled their
way through the song anyway. The recording quality of the vocals was so bad
that the words were next to impossible to decypher. Yet the meaning behind
Sam the Sham and the Pharohes (sp is wrong I know) song Wooly Bully was
clear as a bell and sparked several 'interesting' underground verses to be
created. Sweet Martha couldn't figure it out. 
Also I was at the local Texaco  getting fuel the other night and was
subjected to music and intermittent 'commercials' for the carwash and
sundrie items. I thought ot could be worse at least they are playing Neil
Youngs latest. I mentioned that it was cool that they played Niel not some
gag me Air Supply or Yonni (the schmuck). The young lady behind the counter
said, &quot;Like dude, is that the guy singing on the tape or what?- Who's Neil
Young?&quot; I just smiled and nodded yes it was. Hey, I wouldn't recognise
'Fish' if they were on my plate much less Cool Moe D etc. Point is that I
guess I am a fossil! =) No wonder I'm into Vintage
