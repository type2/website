Hey all,
Today traveling down Route 17 in mid-Virginia on my way to a class, I
came upon a white Vanagon.  He was in the right lane and I was in the
left lane, preparing to pass him.  From a distance the only weird thing
I notice is that there is a yellow lamp on the roof, not flashing, just
a steady yellow lamp.  Then I get closer and see the rectangular German
license plate (with German flag on the left part of the plate) and
notice that the Vanagon has large letters &amp; numbers on the door.  I
don't remember exactly what it said, seems something like GDM-19 or
something similar, not sure exactly what the letters were.  

Then I notice the trucks in front of it.  Turns out that this Vanagon is
part of a convoy of GERMAN MILITARY VEHICLES (well, a very short convoy)
that for some reason are driving through Virginia.  The military
vehicles were your typical really big trucks with canvas on the back,
trucks painted olive green and camoflauge canvas, each truck had the
rectangular German license plate.  I waved at the Vanagon driver but he
didn't wave back, maybe they don't do that in Germany :-) .

The Vanagon was a water-cooled model, I can only guess that it was
Euro-spec, it had the rectangular headlights.  I don't know what these
guys were doing here, invasion maybe? ;-)

Maybe Helmut has something to do with it ;-)
