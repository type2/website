Subject:       'fridge fans some more!

I mounted a 12v muffin fan directly onto the aluminum cooling fins of 
the fridge evaporator and just secured it with a large nylon lock-tie.  Wired it 
to a separate tiny switch next to the LED panel.  The fan draws only 
.06 amps but moves a fair amount of air.  Mounted ontop the 
evaporator, there is NO icing at all, even if I let the fridge run 
down to 17 degrees F.
