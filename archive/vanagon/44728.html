Okay, as possibly the sole list member in Stockton, CA (and if I ain't
youse BETTER speak up!) I have to ask WHICH traffic circle did you do this
in?

&gt;In 1973 when I got my '66 camperbus I used to practice breaking loose the

&gt;traffic circles in Stockton, CA.  I had 185x14&quot; radials of low quality.  I
&gt;never came close to rolling the vehicle on dry streets.  I once did two
&gt;near perfect 360s in a row around a glorietta about 50' in diameter with
&gt;five people in the bus who spent most of the time hanging on or tumbling.

&gt;I found the key to safe sliding is making sure you break the rear end
&gt;loose before the lean gets too radical.
