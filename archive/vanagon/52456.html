Subject: Re: Cool Van things

&gt;    I was in the fuse box today. I noticed this big red thing
&gt;    sticking in the area of the relays.
&gt;    After playing with it I was able to remove it. I found It
&gt;    was a tool to remove the fuses!!!! 
&gt; 
&gt;    And I have have Vanagons for 11 years. THis is where the 
&gt;    manual would have helped.  
&gt;    
&gt;    Also I think that the earlly
&gt;    Vanagon don't have this because there fuse boxes aren't the same.
My Jetta also has this, and my Scirocco had a similar tool designed 
for the older type fuses. I discovered it when wiring for a new 
stereo.
