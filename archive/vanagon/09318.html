&gt;&gt; BRICK       1. Vanagon model Transporters.  2. any VW Bus or Transporter
&gt;I for one don't like this one. Where I come from, a brick is a
&gt;'60s era International Scout. I might be a little out of touch
&gt;with recent usage, however....

to me, a brick was always a Volvo. :)  but others seem to use 'brick' for
the buses, so ...

&gt;&gt; CV-JOINT    one of the small circular devices at an end of an axle on
&gt;Swing-axle VWs don't have CV joints. They have boots at the rear
&gt;which may look like a CV boot, but the stuff inside is different.

well ... that comes from me getting 'swing-axle' screwed up. :)  fix in
progress.

&gt;&gt; KOMBI       generally accepted to mean a mid-range trim model of a
&gt;You might get some discussion on this.  General usage is probably

ha! we've already been round and round on this one. and nobody had a really
definitive answer. about the only SURE thing is that a Kombi doesn't have
lots of chrome. :)

&gt;&gt; SPLIT       the Microbus, made from 1949 to 1967. also called a
&gt;&gt;             Split-Window.
&gt;I don't like referring to pre-68's as split-windows, because of
&gt;the confusion with the bugs with the split back windows.

again, i've heard them called this by others, so ...

&gt;&gt;             they evolved through four (4) 'generations': T1, T2, T3, and
&gt;Is this generally accepted? I've never heard of a type 3 type II.

all the german books i have refer to the 'generations'/body-styles as T1, T2,
T3, and T4 ... that's NOT Type 1, Type 2, ... ALL buses are Type 2. but the
factory apparently called the generations Transporter-1, Transporter-2 or T1,
T2, etc.

&gt;BTW--did anyone call them Westphalias before the Vanagon era,
&gt;when they emblazoned them up on the front of the fiberglas?
&gt;I don't remember that term used in period....

as far as i know, the campers were referred to as Campmobile or just Campers.
i had never heard them referred to as &quot;Westy's&quot; before this list or LiMBO.
and i've never heard a salesperson refer to them as anything but Campers.
but they were all made by Westfalia. in europe, i think they were called
Wohnmobile or Wohnwagen.

&gt;All opinions are those of a middle-aged fart from the Southwest
&gt;who has been with the VW bug for about 25 years....

ah. them aged farts are like old wine: full of vinegar! :)
