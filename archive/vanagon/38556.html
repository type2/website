     &gt;My question is: There only appears to be one connection to the 
     &gt;sender. Should I disconnect the ground and attach the gauge wire? Or 
     &gt;is a ground neccesary as well? If so, where do I connect it? Both 
     &gt;wires to the same connection?
     
     the sender has two wires. a ground wire which is screwed to the body 
     and the wire which goes to the gauge.
     
     I guess the sender is earth separately for safety.
