OK, here goes.  The first line is the date of manufacture:  Feb 27,
1961.  The second line is the option code line.  I don't know what
315 is but 180 is &quot;no middle seat&quot; (this is from the latest NEATO
newsletter, a list of almost all option codes).  The third line is
the export destination code (anyone have a list of these?), then 
the model (yes you have a 221), then a paint code, then the
VIN.

For fun, here's my bus:

09 01 2
374 080 195
UE 231 White 886489

January 9, 1962
374? Divided cab partition (cool!) 195?
231=Kombi (one color, white)

'62 Kombi
