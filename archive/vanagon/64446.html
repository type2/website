Subject:      '87 Syncro Westie Starting problems

Hi Gang,

Spent some time in the Banff area this past weekend and a problem has appeared
again on our van.  It sometimes starts with the key and sometimes we need to
push start it.  It is *very* intermittent.  When it does not start, there is no
starter noise.  The lights come on at the dash are, so the ignition is working,
but no starting.  It happened twice on this trip.  The goofy thing is, it may
not start, so we push start.  we drive for a while and then stop.  It will then
start with the key.... maybe.  Very intermittent and irritating.  I crawled
underneath last night and trace all of the ignition wires as per Bentley.  They
are all tight and rust free.  The last time this happened, 1 month ago, I
tightened all connections.  I don't think this was the problem.  The van
wasn't driven much over the last month so I cannot say for sure.

Any place else I should look or is the starter going to give up the ghost soon??

Is the starter different on a Syncro???  Ron Salmon...  How much?????  ;-)

Thanks for any help.

Cheers
Tony
