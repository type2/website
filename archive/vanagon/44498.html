&gt; tank more corroded rubber. Will I have to drop the engine?  Can I continue
&gt; to drive with 1/2 to 3/4 a tank of gas. I really would not like to see my bus
&gt; burn up. I have recieved some suggestions, I would appreciate many

Well if this is the rubber boot at the top of the filler neck then here is what I had 
done recently.

I had a gas smell when cornering with a relatively full tank in my 77.  So I replaced 
this boot since it was cracked.  This reduced the problem but didn't solve it.  There 
is also a rubber elbow (about 4&quot; long with a slight bend in it) halfway down the filler 
tube which was also cracked and leaking.  VW says that this is a &quot;very specailized 
part&quot; with a &quot;very specific bend&quot; and therefore they want something like $150CDN for it 
and it must be ordered from Germany which would take 6 weeks.  So I got a half decent 
one from a junkyard which is starting to crack but is so far airtight.  To replace it 
my mechanic cut a hole under the bed (you might be able to get in from the round access 
plate in the engine compartment if you were quite nimble and possibly removed some 
equipment -- but I don't know how your 75 is set up so I'll lelave that to you) and 
then riveted/siliconed in back and covered it with duct tape (you know the stuff that 
holds the universe together).

Well, that's my story.  Don't know how relevent it is to you and I guess you probably 
won't know either until you replace your boot and go for a drive with a full tank.

Good luck.
