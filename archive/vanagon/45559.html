 I have a noise from my 1986 Vanagon engine compartment.  Upon further
 investigation I find that the waterpump bearing has a lot of play and is
 getting ready to let go.  Does anyone care to venture a guess at what this
 job could cost. I wonder if I can do it myself.
 
 Any ideas will be welcomed &gt;&gt;
Depending on sourcen figure $125 or so for the pump and 3 hours labor to
change it and bleed and fill the system.

Dennis.
