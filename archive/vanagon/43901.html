&gt;&gt;I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to fit a Yakima bike carrier on
&gt;&gt;top of my 90 Westfalia.  
&gt;&gt;

I bought the attatchable raingutters (you drill two holes and mount
these on your poptop and the racks attatch there).  I added some
sillicone when I put the bolts in.  I whitewater kayak a lot and
haven't had any problems.  I do however take the boats off before
raising the roof, although I have raised it with only one 40lb boat.
You don't need to remove the racks to raise the roof.  I've caried up
to 7 boats (~40lbs each = 280 lbs) for two hours no problems.  This
isn't the norm for me, but...

I also have a bike rack that attatches to the back of the bus.  Drove
cross country last summer with a boat on top, mountain bike on back,
and a mean iguana sitting in the back seat (he hates driving and a
month long trip did not make hime a happy reptile).  Everyone waved at
me, other bus owners, boaters, and bikers!  Ahhh, the memories:)

take care all,
