&gt;A flit-gun is the thing you put bug spray in, sort of like a tire pump 
laying
&gt;on its side with a tomato can attached sideways on one end to hold the bug
&gt;spray, the brand-name of which was 'Flit'.  You pump the handle, the spray
&gt;comes out the nozzle.  Being wedded to spray-cans and destroying the ozone
&gt;layer, Ami-Ricans are probably not familiar with them any more but they are
&gt;still used around the world.  And available at hardware and garden supply
&gt;stores.

Oh, h*ll yes, some of my fondest childhood memories are of sneaking up on
my friends with one of those things full of water, and engaging in all-out
wars shortly thereafter.

Ours said &quot;Black Flag&quot; on it. Dad was stern about our washing them out
before engaging in such hijinks.

Uh... spray cans? Ozone? These had no compressed anything in them, except
when you jammed the handle against your belt buckle and heaved the tube part
toward you with both arms. They were the ultimate environmentally-friendly
weapon of choice.
