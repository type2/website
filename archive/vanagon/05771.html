&gt;I changed my tranny oil in my '78 bus because I didn't know the
&gt;history of the bus. By the looks of the drain plugs I'd say they
&gt;had never been changed. Yes there is a magnet on the drain plug,
&gt;but mine looked like Bart Simpsons hair do when I removed it -
&gt;quit a lot of metal bits were attached. When I put in the new oil,
&gt;which was most definitely correct and by the book oil, the tranny
&gt;was always stiff in first and second gears until the whole lot

I had the EXACT same problem when I changed the fluid in my SO's BMW just
after she bought it (the car, not the farm)  I changed it again a few weeks
later and used 80/90 instead of 85/140, and the problem went away.
