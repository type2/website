Subject: 2.4 Diesel 5 cylinder  

&gt;Hoo-hah!!  A 2.4 5-cylinder diesel in a VW?!?  Tell us more

Well, I don't know if you know or not that in Ireland up to 
very recently it was almost compulsory that if you bought a 
panel van it had to be a Toyota Hiace. You can't throw a stone 
over here without hitting one. As long as I can remember, we 
used Hiaces for our newspaper business. In 1990 we had the need 
to load a full pallette on the van and the current Hiace 
couldn't do that so we bought a second hand Mercedes panel van 
which turned out to be a real heap. We didn't even get it sign 
written because we discovered that the paint was lifting. The 
Mercedes only lasted a few months before we dumped it and by 
this time Toyota had modified the Hiace so that it took a full 
pallette and we bought one.
In early '94 the time came to change again. I had seen P.J.'s 
van and it was way better than the Toyota. I'd always liked 
German cars so I convinced my father it was time to change (it 
wasn't very hard - he'd been with Toyota so long he found it 
hard to change makes but now he could blame me!)
The 1.9 is useless for commercial work. Once it's loaded up you 
literally have no power or acceleration. The 2.4 has 70hp as 
opposed to 45 for the 1.9. It makes all the difference as the 
van is both smooth and powerful at all times. Volkswagens have 
taken over from Toyota in Ireland as the van to be seen in. 
Toyota vans are now only number 3 in the sales figures. Ford is 
number 1 and I think Volkswagen would beat the pants off them 
if they could figure out their supply problems. I ordered my 
van in mid January for delivery at the end of February but it 
was only delivered after many tribulations on March 19th which 
was very annoying and a story I don't want to get into right 
now because it still makes my blood boil.
A few weeks after we got the van I drove it down to Waterford 
to help my sister-in-law move house to Kerry - a round trip of 
about 300 miles. I'd refused to do it in the Toyota as I 
wouldn't drive a Hiace 3 miles if I could help it - it's that 
bad. The VW was faultless even under a heavy load on winding 
country roads and it was comfortable enough to spend a full day 
behind the wheel.
The Hiace I think is slightly faster than the VW as it's a wee 
bit lighter but the handling of the VW more than makes up for 
it.
Another great Clare Champion van tradition was that they were 
always red. Since we were changing makes I thought we should 
change colour and really shock the people. We bought a white 
van and my friend - a sign writer and I spent two months off 
and on designing the livery from January on. I put our logo on 
my computer so that we could print out a huge version to put on 
the side. To add a bit of interest we tilted it to 
approximately 10 degrees. The result was that as soon as people 
got over the shock of seeing that we hadn't bought a Toyota, 
the next thing we heard was &quot;Your logo's crooked&quot;. I'm sure 
there are still people who don't believe it was done 
deliberately.
To sign off, our VW is the coolest thing on the road and the 
local Toyota dealer is still not talking to me. Sad.

P.S. P.J. rang me last night and asked me to wish you all a 
Happy Christmas leaving me nothing more to do than wish you all 
a Happy New Year.
