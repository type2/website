Subject: Re: Neat camping toy. Attn: Martha R.

&gt;Cool, Alistair!  Is this similar to a Russian samovar?
&gt;
&gt;What other neat camping toys does anyone know about?
&gt;
&gt;

Cheap butane lighters - I always have several stashed away in the camper, in 
my coats, in the food box, etc - ever since I went camping and forgot 
matches!!!!

Thermometer - I've got one with a clip to put on the mirror outside, and one 
on the zipper of my jacket.  Always good just to see how hot/cold it was 
outside when you are telling you &quot;famous camping stories&quot; back in civilization.

First aid kit(s) - 'nuff said

Poor man's awning - There was a thread a while back about the advantages of 
awnings, side tents, etc.  I would like a Westy tent, but for now have a 
good shade maker that didn't cost much.  I bought a cheap blue tarp, (you 
know the kind for about $4-$6 at the discount places) three &quot;handi-clamps&quot; 
at our local discount dept store (Target), and a couple tent poles at a 
sporting goods store.  I just take the tarp and clamp it to the drip rail 
front-middle-rear, put the poles in the tarp grommets and stake the poles 
with two stakes.  Works great - provides a place to be shaded in the sun, 
dry in the rain and protects the side entrance from both.  I like to keep a 
rug and some lawn chairs out there.
