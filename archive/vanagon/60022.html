Subject: very poor recall work (long)
Date: Thu, 15 May 1997 16:45:37 -0500

Well, today I picked up the Van from the dealer today, about a month ago,
they performed  the recall on my 86 GL, (replaced fuel tank, idol
controller, ect. and re-attached the AC vents to the roof). Thought I was
getting a good deal, getting all of those new parts for free, BUT, as usual
VW had different plans. Today was my 4th return trip to have them fix  the
gas tank leaking when it's full to the top (never had this problem before,
but appeared the same day I picked it up the first time) They said the
sending unit in/on the fuel tank is leaking, my response: &quot;fix it! It
wasn't broke when I brought it to you&quot; their response: &quot;it's leaking from
the tubes that come out of the top of it. It wasn't part of the recall they
didn't do anything to make it leak, it's just old&quot; Well, I proceeded to
tell them how full of #_at_&amp;! they are, and that they probably made it leak by
pulling too hard on the hose when removing. I haven't looked in my Bentley
yet to see what they are talking about but I just don't see how it CAN'T be
their fault. For now I'll just join the rest of you that can't fill the
tank all the way up :(  I didn't even mention that when they re-attached
the AC vents they tore two of the rubber strips that seal the sections of
the vent together. They just pieced them back up the way they are and I am
REALLY tired of arguing with them. I'll fix the gas tank myself when I get
time and $$ to do it (they wanted $180.00 plus labor) I really am sick and
tired of Dealers dishonesty, inflated prices and I think if I gave a monkey
a 13mm and a set of Allen wrenches, he could do a better job then ANY of
the 4 different places I have hired. Who do I send the info for the
UN-recommended dealers/mechanics to ???? I really don't want these guys to
make any money, especially from anyone on the list!
