Subject: Re: Oil filter on a '74 transporter?

In a message dated 95-09-06 10:31:09 EDT:

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;call me crazy but i was changing the oil in my '74 transporter and cleaned
the
&gt;screen and then noticed a bright orange oil filter...yes...an oil filter. am
&gt;i crazy? i thought that the '74 had only an oil screen. i know this engine
&gt;had been majorly rebuilt but would someone add an oil filter?
  hmmm....maybe
&gt;i misread hayes and the idiots guide. i was sure that the '74 didn't have a
&gt;filter.
&gt;
&gt;hopefully i'll get my axle in the mail from partsplace tommorrow and will be
&gt;able to really drive the van for the first time since i bought it.

Yes, you really do have a filter.  1972 was the first year for these in the
Type II (added protection for very expensive engine parts).
