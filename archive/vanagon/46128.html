Some of you will find this funny, others will think its mean.

I was at a coffee shop the other day, when these 2 slacker betties
went to check out my bus parked there.  One of them was saying &quot;
the front windows open!  How cool!&quot; While the second one said
&quot;I dunno, I think its kinda stup*WHAM!*&quot; and smacked her forehead 
on one of the fully extended safaris!

Never before has a bus gone to such lengths to command respect!
