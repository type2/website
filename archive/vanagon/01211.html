Subject:      Re: bus nomenclature

&gt;of a camper (I think '73) and it is hinged at the front with the
&gt;luggage rack at front too. I've also seen them hinged at the back
&gt;with the luggage rack at front and also every combination in between.

i always heard that the Westfalia versions were hinged at the front (of the
car) with the luggage rack at the rear from 1968-1973 ... and in 1974, the
roof was hinged at the rear with the luggage area at the rear. but then, in
the german stuff i have, Westfalia makes all sorts of different camper models
... not just the ones we saw at the u.s. vw dealers.

&gt;What gives ? Is there any kind of order to how Westfalia  or whoever
&gt;did the modifications ? Also, if you got a Campmobile sticker inside
&gt;does that necessarily mean that Westfalia did it or could it be
&gt;Dehler ?  Also in the Haynes Manual they mention that two models

i think Westfalia put a sticker in the bus saying it was done by them.
see if you can find 'Franz Knobel &amp; Sohnen' on anything. if so, it's Westfalia.

&gt;exist for the '72 thru '79 campers: the Caravette (not Caravelle),
&gt;and the Continental. One sleeps four and the other sleeps two. Mine
&gt;('72)can sleep at least seven or eight. But mine does not hinge at the
&gt;front or back. It pops straight up ! Does anyone else have this ?
&gt;I bet you its a Dehler &lt;*: !!

in my edition of the 'purple Haynes' book (did Prince write this?) ;)
i see a little Westfalia sticker on the side of the front luggage area in
the picture of the 1974 VW Continental - UK specification. at least it looks
like the Westfalia prancing horse to me. but that's the only camper picture
my edition has.

... according to the Alles uber VW Bus book, (as best i can muddle
through the german), straight pop-ups could also be several other companies:
KMM,  Syro,  Joch,   Haas,  EMU,  Berger,  Weinsberg Terra models,
Voll Rhodos models (full length top, and the whole top goes straight up)

&gt;						confused, guntram

don't feel lonesome. :)
