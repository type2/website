Subject: winch on bus?

That's it!!!!

This whole discussion on w%nches brings back the memories of &quot;Gods
Must Be Crazy&quot; 

Sami, when are you going post a picture of your bus hoisted up on a
tree :-) ?

 &gt; Damark offers a winch for about $107 and I was contemplating a purchase.
 &gt; Although this would qualify as a toy rather than a necessity, I've already
 &gt; gotten stuck three times on slippery ground: twice on grass and once on
 &gt; ice; had to call a tow truck in one instance and friends in the other two.
 &gt; Also just read Harry Yates' fascinating Travelogue on Ron Lussier's
 &gt; excellent page and now totally *NEED* that winch. (But most of all, I'm
 &gt; just looking for a distraction from work :-) )
 &gt; 
 &gt; Anyway, is there anyone with a useful opinion out there? How would I
 &gt; attach the winch to the bus's front? 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Merci.
