Subject: 	Do I have a CV joint problem?  82 Westy

I replaced the tire and within 50 miles was occasionally hearing a=20
strange sound from the back of the van - ESPECIALLY when I make a right=20
turn.

The sound is &quot;RrRrRrRrRrRrR&quot;.  Almost as if the tire were rubbing on=20
something - but it's not.

QUESTION:  Are my joints bad?  If it is a joint problem - do you =
recommend replacing all=20
4 joints at the same time?

That seems like the same noise I heard from the back of my '85 GL.  =
Almost like you have a rock in your tire, but you can't find one.  I =
asked just about the same question of the nice folks on this list, and =
got super advice.

It was two things in my van;  the wheel bearings and the CV joints.  =
I've replaced the wheel bearings on that side only, and the noise has =
disappeared when driving straight.  However, in a turn on the side the =
noise comes from, I still occasionally hear it, so I'm saving for the =
next phase, replacement of both of the CV joints on that side of the =
vehicle.

I won't replace the other side until I need to.  Gives me more time to =
save!!!
