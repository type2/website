Subject: Vanagon Tow Bar

I saw one on the front of a guy's Vanagon one time but did not look at it 
real close (should have). He had made it himself.

Has anyone made a tow bar for a Vanagon? 

Any pointers for fabricating one? 

Any ideas for a commercially available tow bar? 

Thanks in advance!
