RE:	Copy of: 85 westy weekender - longish ramble/sorry

Hi, Chris, The '85 you were looking at was a Wolfsburg Edition Westy Weekender
(phew! outta breath! ) - as Jim Davis says &quot;term for the verbose&quot;  :&lt;)  (ie.
non-GL Westy) and there should have been a fridge that bolts to the floor behind
the passenger seat. Go back and look at it and look at the floor in the cargo
area. You will see a few small holes in the plastic floor covering, this is
where the fridge was. You will also notice what appears to be a &quot;cigarette
lighter&quot; recepticle under the inside of the front passenger seat mount pedestal.
That is where the fridge plugs in. If the fridge isn't there, then that is a
significant drawback, and should be reflected in the asking price. These fridges
are hard to find because they were only offered  in '85-'86 on these non-GL
Westy wolfs. models. The guy probably kept it and is using it in his garage to
keep the brewskies cool. 

theres a guy in my area (Allentown, Pa.) who's currently selling one of these
models  with 94k orig. mi, and he's asking 4500 obo. It is a 4spd and has A/C
and no rust.
