Let me throw in my favorite odd tool for the &quot;every tool you 
could ever want to carry in the closet of your Campmobile&quot;
list----

A crochet hook for pulling back the generator brush springs.

Note to you UK/AUS/NZ readers -- a crochet hook is a thin 
steel rod with a little hook on the end -- it has nothing
to do with the note value between a minim and a quaver. ;-&gt;
