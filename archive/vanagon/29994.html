Subject: A reason for dropped valve seats
Date: Fri, 1 Dec 1995 17:25:30 -0600 (CST)

Just a theory: Rich running engines will have heads that are too *cold*,
hence a higher temperature differential with the valve seats. Different
expansion rates of the 2 metals causes seats to drop.

If true, this may be of relevance to those who wish to replace their
precious FI with carburators. Discuss amongst yourselves... :)
