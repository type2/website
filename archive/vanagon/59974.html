&gt; &gt;Does anyone know if the Westy outlet receptacles for the water, electric
&gt; &gt;and water tank have to be replaced with the exact ones or can I get them
&gt; &gt;at any RV store. The dealers price is ridiculous.
&gt; 
&gt; Go to Euro-American RV Products.  They used to be Delta Six industries,
who
&gt; manufactured these originally.  Their phone number (1.818.760.4214) 

I've got 'em too.
