Subject: Update from the Copleys


I finally heard from Christa this morning, she sent me email from
Schwarzie's account, so he might have told you about their update or
not, I don't know since I am in digest mode.

Today is very busy, so I must give you the expurgated version:

After leaving my place last Monday they fixed their aux. gas heater
that day and headed out of our rainy provin^H^H^H^H^H^Hstate towards
Las Vegas for some gambling (now who can see the town name Las Vegas
without thinking that line from the Sheryl Crow song?). They won $3.00
on the first day then lost $5.00 the next...that darn Tobin just
doesn't know when to quit when he is ahead :)

So Dave, that is why they didn't make it down to SLO.

They loved the beauty of the Grand Canyon, saying that it was as
wonderful as everyone has said...&quot;awesome&quot; they said trying to be
american, but they forgot the &quot;dude&quot; to be truely Californian.

Vdub on dudes.
