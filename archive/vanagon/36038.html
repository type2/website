Subject: Vehicle value/price

 Hi! I'm desperate and hope that you can help me! I need a source of
car/trucks prices; old vehicles, that is. I remember a magazine type that
had these but not the name. It contained prices for vehicles from the very
early 1900's to the present.

 Are there more sources of prices for antiques and collectibles? Would you
direct me to these sources? Thanks in advance.
