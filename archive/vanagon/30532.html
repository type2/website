&gt; I know there has been some discussion regarding a V_at_L bumper sticker...
&gt; could someone whip one up before 12/30??
&gt; 


You could always draw one up yourself and take it down to the local
kinkos copy shop.  the ones here have a little &quot;copier&quot; machine that
will color copy onto a bumper sticker for you.  i bet you have one
near you too.
