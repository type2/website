jon&gt; Memorable hauls from the past:
jon&gt;
jon&gt; Full sized washer &amp; dryers (the cargo doors were bungied together)
jon&gt; 5 large full kegs of beer and 4 'riders' in a 40hp rusty Westy
jon&gt;           (they can bottom out!) A large fiberglass shower
jon&gt; Numerous tonages of VW parts
jon&gt;
jon&gt; Any interesting additions from you Vanagon listers? Come forth

And I say:

        We-el, just last week I got a Yamaha 750, $130 worth of groceries,
and 2 people in the bus. This is of course in addition to the usual
assortment of tools, floor jack, etc. FAHRVERNUGEN!!!
