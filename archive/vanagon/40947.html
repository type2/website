Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)

---snip---
&gt;I suggested a minor marketing concept that if they shipped catalogs to
&gt;all of the folks that I knew never got them that they just might sell more
&gt;items. (duh!).
&gt;Did the catalog come with the order? NOPE!
---snip---
&gt;I figure that if they can't handle a catalog after SIX requests then I
&gt;shouldn't count on getting nicer handles.
&gt;BB Part # for the latches were 211-847-515 NEATO discount= $31.96 ea.

 What a relief! I thought they didn't like me! Obviously, one of two things
are happening. Either they think they got the market cornered and are not
worried about getting new customers and making more money OR they just don't
give a rat's butt.

 Since I believe more in the latter, they won't be getting an order for
parts from me nor a penny. There are other places to get parts from and
people in the list which have treated me very nicely, indeed.

 It is kind of ackward, though. I send a check to someone I have never met,
to somewhere I've never been, for a part I've never seen, and in a box
sealed so tight that of which even Pony Express would be envious.

 I'm very proud of the members of this list which make the term HONORABLE a
valuable commodity! You should all be proud, as well!
