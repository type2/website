Transporter Talk

WHAT IS IT?

With the Volkswagen show season in full swing, I find myself attending
one event nearly every weekend. With the SOTO Anniversary Meet, in
Garden Grove, CA, over with, I can get back to doing what I enjoy most
at shows, talking to folks about their buses. At every show I get at
least one person telling me about their Kombi or Deluxe, and when they
show me the bus, it turns out to be something else entirely.  This
month I'm going to try and set the record straight as to what is what,
in as simple of terms as possible.

The flagship of the Transporter line was the Deluxe Microbus.  Many
people confuse the terms &quot;Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Sunroof,&quot; or use them
interchangeably.  A Deluxe, simply put, is a bus that has at least
four windows behind the front doors (one in each cargo door and at
least two more to the rear of those). The Deluxe was also the only
model that came from the factory with a clock in the passenger side
of the dashboard, polished aluminum beltline and rocker molding,
polished aluminum trim on the bumpers, a chrome front ashtray, chrome
speedometer trim ring and a chrome plated front Volkswagen emblem.
Other Deluxe only features were &quot;jailbar&quot; glass protectors inside the
rearmost windows, and an aluminum grab bar/passenger protector on the
rear seat. Deluxes could be ordered with or without a sunroof, the
sunroof model is probably the most highly sought after Type 2 today.
Deluxes usually came in a two-tone color scheme, with the exception
that a few came in solid Lotus White.

The Microbus, or Standard as I'll refer to it, was the basic station
wagon model. The Standard had the same window configuration as the
Kombi (3 windows behind the front doors), but had much more
luxurious interior appointments. The Standard came with a full
headliner, door panels front and rear, and with rear seats. The
Standard came mainly in two-tone paint schemes, which makes
differentiating between the Standard and Kombi easy on original paint
vehicles. The front VW emblem was always painted the same color as the
lower half of the bus, and the wheels were the same two-tone
combination as the bus, on the models before 1959.

The Kombi is often confused with the Standard. The Kombi is essentially
a Panel bus with 3 windows down the sides. The Kombi could be ordered
with or without rear seating (I have a neat 1958 Kombi that came with
no rear seat hold downs and came from the factory in primer). The
cargo/passenger area of the Kombi was finished in gray primer and had
no panels or headliner. As you can probably deduce frm the name, the
Kombi was designed as a combi-nation vehicle, for hauling passengers
or cargo. The Kombi always came in solid colors, and had gray painted
hubcaps, as did all of the commercial models (Panels and all Trucks).

The Panel or Delivery Van is just what its name implies. This was the
basic cargo hauling model in the Transporter line. The Panel had no
windows down the side behind the front doors, and for extra cargo
privacy, could even be ordered with a solid (no window) rear hatch.
The Panel came only with front seats, there were no provisions for
seats in the rear, after all, this bus was made for hauling stuff,
not people! The Panel also came with a cargo area/passenger compartment
divider with a small window (on the bench seat models), so the Panel
is among the quietest of the Type 2s to drive. Panels, like all
commercial models, came in solid colors and had gray painted hubcaps.
Many Panels, however, were ordered with custom paint schemes or in
primer, ostensibly so the companies which purchased them could make
them into a rolling billboard for their business. This is a trend that
appears to be making a comeback, with lots of current businesses using
early buses as advertising vehicles. Recently, a 1967 Panel was
discovered for sale at the Pomona Swap Meet with the original logo,
Dart Carpet Cleaning, still intact and purchased by local Type 2
aficionado and part time Bus Stop assistant, Ryan.

We'll finish up with the Pickup models. If you don't know that you're
driving a Pickup model, you should seek help elsewhere. The trucks
came in two basic configurations, the Single Cab, and the Double Cab,
or Crew Cab. The Single Cab had seating for three in the cab area and
had a bed that measures five by nine feet. The Single Cab also has a
lockable storage compartment beneath the bed, sometimes known as the
treasure chest. All truck models (without special bodies anyway) came
with the fold-down gates on all three sides of the bed. This made the
trucks dual purpose, usable as either a normal pickup truck or as a
flatbed with the sides down. The Double Cab truck had, believe it or
not, a Double Cab ... imagine that. The Double Cab had interior seating
for six people, with a neat storage area beneath the rear seat.  The
Double Cab obviously had a shorter pickup bed, but was still
extremely useful for hauling cargo. Both of the trucks were available
with a &quot;tilt,&quot; &lt;sic&gt; more commonly known as a covered wagon. This was
a system of bows and rails that were covered with a removable canvas
cover, which had roll-up sides for easy access. The tilt made the
bed area virtually weatherproof, and could easily be removed for
larger loads. To find an original these days is pretty hard, and you
can expect to pay some good money for one if you're fortunate enough
to find a nice original.

Hopefully this has helped those of you out there who are unsure of
the &quot;official&quot; model name of the bus you drive. If you have more
specific questions, please don't hesitate to write me at:
David Heard              or even call me at (510) 937-7686
P. O. Box 3555                                    937-SOTO,
Walnut Creek, CA 94598

The best time to reach me in person is between six and ten o'clock
in the evening, Pacific Standard Time.

Take the bus every day!

joels' comments:

i think he got some proofreading errors in that last part. i had always
heard the rear canvas bed cover referred to as the &quot;tent&quot;.  the &quot;tilt&quot;
was, i thought, a dump-truck bed that was orderable as an option from
the factory (on either Single Cab or Double Cab models).
