Subject: Groved pushrod end

	Alistair Bell writes that he has

&quot;But lo, another mystery... one of the pushrods has been &quot;grooved&quot; about 1
1/2&quot; from one end. It is as if it was done on a lathe, 1/4&quot; long, 1/4&quot;
deep. I only noticed it after I had all of the pushrods from one side in a
tub so I don't know wether it was the head or case end.&quot;

	I had this on my 69 with the destroyed block- my best guess is
that my pushrod rubbed on the outside of the follower. Alistair,
if you slip a follower into one of the bores, you'll quickly see whether
the groove matches the case end of the pushrod tube or the head
end of the pushrod tube- you might want to stick a finger or shine
a flashlight into each follower bore and make sure they're intact.
	You might just have had a bit of something sticking out from
the edge of the pushrod tube too...

	&quot;Parkerized&quot; is a proprietary process for hardening steel-
could that be the word you meant? 

	Cheers!
	Bill
