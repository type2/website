Subject: Query: Type 2 Transmission Interchangability

My old '60 pickup has a habit of slipping out of fourth gear.  I found 
a 1966 transmission complete with axle tubes and final drive gears.  I 
want to use the '66 transmission with my old axle tubes and final 
gearboxes.  Will the axle shafts from the '66 properly fit into my '60 
differental side gears?  I have not yet removed the transaxle from my 
truck yet but I have removed the axles from the later model set. The 
nuts on the '66 wheel axles are 46mm as opposed to the 38mm nuts on the 
'60 wheel axle shafts.
