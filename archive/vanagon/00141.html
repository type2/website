Subject: Re: Kombi, Kombi, who's got the Kombi ... (differences)


Hannover is the plant where ALL T1 Type IIs for the European, and
North American models were made. In fact Hannover, was built so that
Type II production could be shifted out of Wolfsburg. Somehow the
theory that Kombi is the short name of the town in Germany where
the Type IIs were made is farfetched indeed!
