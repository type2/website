Subject: Need rear speaker clips





Does anyone know of a source for the plastic clips that hold the rear
speakers tight against the roof?  I'm referring to the stock speakers that
came in the 84GL with the tape deck; I hit one putting something in the
back and broke the clip and there isn't any obvious way that I could see to
jury-rig the sucker so it doesn't swing back and forth.

TIA,
Peter Eaton
