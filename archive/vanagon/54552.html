Subject: Re: '82 2-Litre Heads for Carbs?



&gt;I have been offered an '82 2-litre motor that has been converted to a 
&gt;carb.  I haven't looked at the motor yet, but am wondering what mods or 
&gt;swaps might have been made to the heads to use a carb instead of the FI.
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking this might be a rebuildable motor to have ready when my 
&gt;current '81 (2-litre FI) gives it up.  The motor is not frozen and is
&gt; $150.  
&gt;
&gt;Good deal?

Probably nothing has been done to the heads.  I'd imagine a different 
intake manifold was fitted, but that's all.  Should be easy to convert 
back.  $150's a very good price if it's a good motor, but only an okay 
price if it's already in need of rebuilding.
