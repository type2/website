James et al -
I have heard through RV dealers that newer propane fridges have an 
electronic ignition, and they CAN be used while driving?  While the 
pilot light types do run the risk of blowing out and having gas build 
up.  My '80 12V ran while we were driving, I didn't want to risk the 
propane.  Now it's an ice box, as 12v, 120v, &amp; propane don't work.  
Work's great for weekends.

&gt; I've NEVER had the flame in my fridge blow out on any of my Vanagons while
&gt; I was driving and I would definately dispute the notion that the system is
&gt; not designed to be used while driving.  There are troubleshooting
&gt; procedures that I've seen on this list that pertain to fixing problems that
&gt; will cause blow out while driving.
