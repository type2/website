&gt; aye, there's the rub: only available on NA buses. :(  what we need is a
&gt; euro-junkyard over here!! which brings up a thought: do they have junkyards
&gt; in germany? i mean, what with the TUV and all, can you take parts off
&gt; wrecked cars and use them??

They do have junkyards, but they are getting harder to find.  They are
doing more and more car &quot;recycling&quot; over there.  But 10 years ago when
I lived there, I spent a lot of time in the Stuttgart area junkyards, and
found them to be much as they are here - only difference being they had
almost entirely late-model cars, and most of them had beautiful motors
and interiors and major rust on the body.
