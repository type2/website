Well, according to the guy who restored Steve Wood's 50? Panel in Seattle, 
you have to cut a newer splity's rubber at a 90 degree angle and 
determine where the cut needs to be made &amp; make another 90 degree cut.  
Using 'crazy glue' or 'super glue' adhere the 20 cuts together.

You may recall this Panel as it was in Hot VWs a while back--ceiling wax 
red &amp; dove blue with old style lettering on it.
