Subject: Re: DMV

&gt;To get rid of the corpse of the 68, do what all other mass murderers do;
&gt;cut it up and distribute the bits. ;) I have a 68 wish-list myself, let me
&gt;know if you're going to part it out.
        I can let you in on a little secret here: it's is your legal
responsibility to provide the buyer of a vehicle with a smog cert. And it's
his responsibility to bring it with when he registers the car. And DMV
doesn't know or care who actually got the cert, as long as it's there at
registration time. I've bought 3 cars in CA (I'm an out of state student in
Texas), and I've never gotten a somg from the seller. That was my problem,
since I was buying the fixer-upper. And my 009,-DP
1600,-no-charcol-canister-or-vacuum-hose engine in the '68 got smogged for
a small amount of grease from a shop which shall go un-named (Fred! Hook up
the Pinto!!). In other words, a little creativity will go a long way.
        (Flame discliamer: I am slowly making my engine more stock as I
replace parts, I just can't afford to drop $3-400 in smog goodies).

Peace,
