Subject: alternator cooling housing



I have a couple more observations...

I have a Bosch 90 A alternator, and the housing fits onto the back
perfectly except that when the alternator is in its working position, the
portion of the housing that forms a tube to mate with the duct is pressed
against the block of my engine. This means that the duct has to make a 70
degree turn right away to clear the rest of the engine. This may not be a
problem for wasserboxers, there might be enough clearance.
Also, the housing has a bracket and grommet to make a fairlead for the
electrical wires, but I couldn't use that due to the way I oriented the
aforementioned tube part of the housing. But there is no problem with the
wires just coming out from the housing.
You know, it just looks better to have the back of your alternator covered.

Alistair
