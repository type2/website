&gt;&gt;If I might, somewhere between Dallas and Raleigh is Fall Creek Falls,
&gt;&gt;Tennessee, which is gorgeous.
&gt;
&gt;That looks great: my map shows it about halfway betweeen Nashville and
&gt;Knoxville, about thirty miles south of I40.

I probably should have looked, because poor David Schwardze--that makes it
a 1500 mile round trip for him. It's a long way to go, even if we are good
company.
