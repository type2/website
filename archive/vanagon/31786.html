Subject: RE: 1600 in a 73 - round 2

Brandy Smith wants to know how hard it would be to make new engine tin to
fit a Type 1 engine lost in the cavern of a Type 4 engine compartment.
Not hard.  Pop rivet gun, aluminum sheet, tin snips.  UNLESS you want good
looks.  I can't remember what 1973 engine seal rubber looks like, but
aircooled Vgon seal is really neat: fills gap of anywhere from 1/4 to 1
inch, so you don't need to get the shape exact.

When you are computing relative value of Type 1 versus Type 4, keep in
mind that, all other things being equal, the Type 4 will last longer.
For this and all the conventional (some is good, more is better, too much
is just enough) reasons, I would go with the bigger engine.  And -- I did.
