Got drug to a Dead show last night and saw a guy selling t-shirts with the
best Farvegnugen (sp?) takeoff I've yet seen:

Fukenbroken

(all in the appropriate typestyle, etc.)

Didn't buy one out of various karmic concerns (ask and ye shall receive),
but looking at the state of the busses being driven by most Deadheads
(primarily extremely tired mid-70s campers, only saw one decent splittie),
it seemed spot on appropriate.
