Grovel you Son of a Bitch...I was right all a long....go ahead
Joel, say it again so EVERYONE can hear...

Ric, and the other EuroVanners were right...EuorVans are the BEST
thing since the Porsche 911...or at least since sliced white
bread!

Yep...EUROVAN...no longer worthy of defending as Joel put it the
other day when I called myself the defender of EuroVans...

The rest of you EuroVanners, while Joel is grovelling...start
singing &quot;We are the champions my friends....&quot;

WAIT...that sound too much like the end of Revenge of the Nerds
(the movie)...we are definately NOT Nerds...

Hmmm...(in my best singing voice)...EuroVan, EuoVan Uber Alles...

Today Car &amp; Driver....tomorrow VW T&amp;A...oops Trends...

Yep...sano custom EuroVans on the cover of VW T&amp;A with
Big breasted blonde bitchin' bikini bimbo babes ... 
aliteration....hell I'm a litterary genious!!

Seriously, however, its nice to see the EV getting the recognition
it deserves.....I WAS RIGHT!!!!!!!!!   :-)

Ric the Wise
