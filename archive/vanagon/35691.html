&quot;Donald W. Smith&quot; &lt;dons_at_tower.tandem_dot_com&gt; advised:

++ 5) Keep your brakes (and tires) in good working order.

I offer my own advice for brake newbies (like myself):

DON'T TRUST THE LITTLE &quot;BRAKE WINDOW&quot; to check on lining thickness.

A quick peek through the brake windows on the '70 suggested that they 
were fine.  However, since I resurrected this Kombi from a parts yard, 
perhaps I should have known better.  

I pulled the drums, and found that the shoes were wearing unevenly, like 
down to the rivets in the middle.  Plenty o' pad where the brake windows 
are.  

I'm happy to report that the Kombi brakes (&amp;wheel bearings, too) are in 
fine shape after an extensive (5 day) brake job.  Really makes a 
difference.
