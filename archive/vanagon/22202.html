&gt; p.s. - the new one is the same size as the one i took off, but it won't fit. 
&gt; the old one wasn't that hard to get off - this is puzzling.

Stock heat exchangers won't fit my van either, cause I had to tap a
couple of the mounting studs (easy, Steve!) and one of them was just a
bit off center.  I drilled out the holes in the heat exchanger to make
it fit.  I don't suppose this is an option for you?
