&gt; Well I'm about to go ahead and do it. After two years putting it off I am
&gt; going to order window seals all around for my 71 bus. Any suggestions were
&gt; from? 

I just replaced my drivers door seal from J.C. Whitney.  The quality of the
rubber doesn't look *that* good, but for $23 (I think that's about what I
paid) it was a great deal!  It was easy to install and the door seals
beautifully now!  I am completely happy with J.C. Whitney - have yet to get
something from them I didn't like.
