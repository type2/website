Subject: Re: I bought the '70 single cab!

	All,
	Well, I'm afraid we won't be able to go for a ride in
it yet- remember, it has no engine at the moment? 
	But I took posession of the bits and pieces last night- 
case + crank and rods, heads, one showing aluminum splashes inside
where the failed piston melted (icky!)
	Its a dual-port 1800 built with a deep sump. Has a 34 PCIT-3
carb, a 71's vacuum advance distributor. Former Owner says that 
the case is a &quot;21&quot;- what is a &quot;21&quot; case and what's neat about one?

	Bottom line, folks: Should I attempt to re-use a case, crank,
rods and heads from an engine that burned a piston after only a few
hours of running? Has anyone got experience CA smogging a dual-port big-bore
when a single-port 1600 was stock? Can anyone recomend a shop for
air-cooled machine work in the South Bay?

	First thing I'm going to do is count the pieces and clean-up
the obviously reusable stuff, like the engine tin, generator (I think...),
heat exchangers and extractors. It's set up with a dog-house cooler.

	Obviously missing are the pistons and cylinders, pushrods and
pushrod tubes, and the valve covers. If the generator mounts
on a pedestal (like a type 1) then the pedestal is missing. There
doesn't seem to be a muffler :-) Looking at the fuel pump as we 
were packing up the pieces, Former Owner determined that it was
a fire hazard and threw it away for me. I decided to take this
as 'good advice'. I didn't see anything that even remotely resembled
the thermostat or flaps I remember from a Type IV- Former Owner
confirms that the engine did not have any of the cooling accesories.

	I do have a stock-looking air cleaner and piping. The heads 
are new, and look new. Former Owner advised having them cleaned-up 
and perhaps both seats replaced in the burned  
m 

cylender, and then using them.

	OTOH, the new and painted-to-match side and back gates
are mounted, along with the nose-grille, also a replacement and
painted to match, and they look pretty good!

	Both boots on the starboard axle are shot. That's probably
job #2, while waiting for whatever I order engine-wise to arrive.
