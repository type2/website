&gt; New to the Vanagon List so please excuse any breaches in Netiqette.
&gt; 
&gt;  I recently aquired a '61 Single Cab and i'm looking for accesories namely
&gt; safaris and EMPI stuff for it hopefully it'll be ready to drive and show by
&gt; this summer. I already have a couple bitchen pieces that i'll bet more than
&gt; a few of you didn't know even existed.

Dude, are you really sure it is bitchin'?  What about sano? 

Just kidding of course.  (Such language as &quot;bitchin, sano, resto, 
etc., is usually mocked by the list.  And I agree!)
 
So do tell us about your secret pieces?  

Are you interested in some EMPI steps that hook under the bumpers by 
the front doors?
