Subject:      Eurovan Syncro!

Hi All,

Just read the post by Peter Larsson with refference to his 1994 Eurovan
Doublecab Diesel Syncro.

Question:  Why have we not seen any Eurovan Diesel Syncros over here in
the USA?  After all, there is little about the new Eurovan to tempt the
Vanagon Westie owner into mortgate-like car payments......&quot;but a Eurovan
Diesel Syncro Camper&quot; that would be a different story.  Cheap to run and
maintain, and an engine to last?  I (like many who drive 2wd Westies)
still suffer from the old &quot;Syncro Envy&quot;, great for snowy climates like
Alaska!

I have looked at the EV Campers on our local VW lot and I must say they
look low, I'd say they have less ground clearance than my 88 Westie!
Until I see a Syncro out there I'm not interested in even a test drive.
Does the NEW Syncro have a little extra ground clearance like the old
Vanagon Syncro?

Please let us know about the new Syncros!

Regards,
Chris Gibbs

PS. Maybe Peter can FedEx us one or two from Sweden ;-)
