Hi all,
I'm writing a webpage about my Split and I'd like to have links to other
split-owners' pages. 
If any of you have a sec, can you mail me your URL?
Also let me know if you particularly don't want to be linked to from my page.
(especially David Schwarze &amp; Lee Griffiths who will otherwise be put on
whether they like it or not!)
Cheers,
Sarah
