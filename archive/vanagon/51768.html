I saw one of these when I was in Vermont, it was on the interstate going
in the opposite direction.  Also seen one closer to here but I can't
remember where or when :)

BTW, was at a local RV place recently and they had a couple.
Interesting vehicles, them Rialtas.  A little too darn big (and
water-cooled) for my tastes :)

&gt; &gt; Come to think it of we passed one inbound on Interstate 66 after the
&gt; &gt; last mid-atlantic campout. We even waved; all we got back was a 
&gt; &gt; grumpy look.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; There's been at least one on the local VW lot for a while here 
&gt; (Victoria). Still never seen one on the road though...
