&gt;a speed bump, I hear this grinding noise (Knarren und Knirschen) from the
&gt;front left wheel well. Any ideas what part got damaged, if it requires
&gt;attention, and how much effort (time and money) it takes to fix the problem?

hmmmm. if it grinds ONLY when you hit another speed bump, then let's see ...
- ball joints and tie rod ends should be making Klunking noises.
- shock absorber bushings would also make Klunky noises.
- could be a brake caliper dragging on the rotor as the suspension moves
    around. probably not damaged, just out of whack. try putting on your
    brakes really hard and see if you hear anything else untoward ... i'd
    advise doing this in a parking lot, without a lot of traffic around. :)
- could be a wheel bearing but it oughta be making noise pretty much all
    the time.

you sure maybe it's not a 'scrapping' sound? like maybe your shocks are gone
and your wheel is rubbing on the wheel well when the suspension is fully
compressed?

also: sounds are the hardest things (squeaks and rattles) to track down.
get someone else to sit in back and tell you where they think the noise is
coming from. it might actually be from the rear wheels (which have drums and
imho might be more likely to knirsche and Knarre.

just crawl up under there and take a look-see with a flash-light and see
if anything looks scrapped, broken, worn, whatever. but do that part with
the extra people first.

good luck.
