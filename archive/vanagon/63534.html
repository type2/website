Subject: re EV problems

&gt;
&gt;My Beefs:
&gt;
&gt;1.  That &amp;^%$$#^&amp; Norcold fridge.  Delivered with a DOA igniter in 1995.
&gt; Igniter (probably) has failed again.
&gt;
&gt;2.  That *&amp;^^%^ Norcold fridge.  Won't operate on propane over 5,000
&gt;feet.  Seems Winnebago omitted the high-altitude kit...
&gt;

This is pretty weird. I've had mine at 6000+ feet and it worked fine.
Now perhaps it was a little colder - we were up at Columbia Icefields area.

&gt;3.  That terrible paint.  Seems that VW's environmental consciousness
&gt;exceeds their ability to formulate a decent water-based paint.  Little
&gt;rust blooms all over.
&gt;

awhile back I posted something about water-borne paints. I just keep mine
waxed.

&gt;4.  Those paper blinds.  Either their cords pop out of their holders, or
&gt; they get mashed by something.  The one on the sliding door is
&gt;vulnerable to everything.  If they won't replace it, I'll make curtains.
&gt;

The sliding door screen can be 'fixed' by bolting it up. Local dealer fixed
mine when it started to fall out right after I bought it. Said it was on a
Service Bulletin awhile back.

oh well. At least you had some good things to say.
You want me to post your +/- comments on the EV page?
