Subject: FDyen listening? (fwd) successful Fairbanks rescue

good buddy dan the skateboarding splittie van man dropped in yesterday
enroute from fairbanks to ensenada.  need to put him in touch w/ fdyen.

inspite of dan spending all summer working on helo's in a mining camp east
of Delta he managed to rescue a '63 deluxe (been parked 21 years) and a '61
camper (tilt up /camper door in the roof, pretty much original, 36hp et
al).  gonna be some busy winter nights at the Tundra Helo's hanger.


later,
dwight
