Subject: Re: Painting Pop Top

OK, I'm getting all this flood of stuff on gelcoats, surfboards, etc.

BUT...

I am not particularly interested in the top looking perfect or pretty,
just simply don't want it to have fibers sticking out, and
want to protect it.

Given that I don't care if it looks like a perfect, new surfboard,
from what's been posted here, I can see that SOME material that
has a little &quot;give&quot; or flexability to it should be used.  How
about sanding it, putting on a white (semi- or solid-) stain,
then finishing it up with something like low- or non-gloss
verathane?  Or some polyacrylic which gives a bit, maybe even
a latex-based product?
