&gt;&gt; So can we entice Tobin &amp; Christa down again??  I doubt it, since they were

&gt;
&gt;Hey!  What was the problem with the weather?!?  We've been having exactly 
&gt;the same sort of weather here for a month non-stop (got mud for tap water 
&gt;to prove it, ever since we've had a series of mud slides in 2 of our 3 
&gt;water reservoirs), so it's all the same to me.  Mentioned the reunion to 
&gt;Christa this morning after hearing the idea from martha, and she would 
&gt;really like to go.  
&gt;
&gt;I think that (for once) the saner part of my head (yes, there is sanity 
&gt;in there somewhere... I think) should prevail, so I think a 2,000 mile 
&gt;weekend camping trip is kinda out.  Unless we change our minds (or 
&gt;totally blow them) of course.    ;-)~
&gt;
&gt;I assume somebody will bring Bob along, so say a big &quot;hi&quot; for me. *:-)~
&gt;
&gt;Should we mail down some prunes?

That's not mud in our tap water.  It's brown fluoride.
