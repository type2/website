NO NO NO!!!!   Sorry, but this is wrong.  It is the SELLER's responsibility
to provide a smog certificate when selling a used vehicle, unless they
have changed the rules in the last couple of months, which I doubt...

&gt; 				Smogging has to be done every other year
&gt; and mailed in with the reregistration payment.  

Well, it doesn't *have* to be.  You can register a vehicle without a smog
certificate, without penalty.  They just won't let you drive it.  :)
