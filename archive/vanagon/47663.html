On my 87 2.1l, I installed the oil temp sensor in the oil drain, replacing 
the oil drain plug. Had to manufacture a &quot;thin wall&quot; socket to install and 
remove the sensor because the oil drain plug is recessed into a small round 
area. Don't know about the 1.9 case.

To install the pressure sensor, you have to run some tubing up to the top 
of the engine and install a T fitting to accommodate the sensor and the old 
idiot light sensor. You should a sensor that is compatible with whatever 
gauge you are using.

You might search the archives for a detailed account of my experience 
installing these two sensors. I think it was posted sometime in June 1996. 
Better yet, I'll forward it to you if I can find a copy.
