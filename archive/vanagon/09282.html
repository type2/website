So Jeff P. Schneiter says:
&gt; 
&gt; I shall volunteer to make a 24 egg scramble, almost like a Denver
&gt; omlette but messier and with more stuff. Feeds about 10 to 12 people.
&gt; 
&gt; Things that would go with it - toast, bagels, home fries, hash browns,
&gt; salsa, fruit, ?? Could someone please volunteer to bring some such stuff.
&gt; 
&gt;  jeff
&gt; ps. there are 40mph winds hitting the coast, and some 20+ft waves, and
&gt; a whole lot of rain today.

Sounds great Jeff!  Are you volunteering this for the Saturday morning
breakfast thing (Pancakes a la Martha) or is this for Sunday?

I'm already bringing bacon for Marthas.  I really don't know how much
to bring though.  Am I going to have to put a pig up top to keep Thom F.
company or what? ;)  Let's sort this out ASAP.  I'd like to see more people
posting their inputs about this. (Hint...Hint)  :)
