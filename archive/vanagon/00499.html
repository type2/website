Subject: Re: Fuel Usage

I am suprised that nobody mentioned the real reason I was risking things by
running out of gas. It isn't sludge, as Hank's excellent contribution
explained, but the fuel pump!

YOU SHOULD NEVER RUN OUT OF GAS!

The reason is that the fuel pump is lubricated by gas only, and when the gas
runs dry the fuel pump runs dry, and can sustain swift damage! 

Mine seemed to survive my test, however...
