&gt; Anyway, I need your advice on replacing the fan switch.  Must the 
&gt; radiator be removed to do that?  I have a AC radiator in front of the 
&gt; engine radiator. 
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like mine is a 3 prong switch screwed into the radiator about 
&gt; half way down on the right side (facing radiator from front).  It looks 
&gt; like it might be minimally accessible with the right socket wrench, or 
&gt; maybe it's too much trouble and I need to dismount everything.
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; And do you think I accurately purge tested the air or not?

You have probably purged what air you have in the system out, to 
completely do this, however, the front of the van needs to be raised 40cm 
(15in) above the back (I just went through all this) while you are 
bleeding the radiator.

I am curious about one thing.  Isn't it sufficiently cold enough in Iowa 
City this time of year that you fan shouldn't be coming on very much (if 
at all)?  Does your fan come on when you turn on the AC?  It should, 
automatically.  Perhaps before you replace your fan switch, try turning 
on the AC (if the fan comes on simultaneously) and see what your 
temperature gauge does.

If the AC test works, and you can reach the thermoswitch, by all means 
replace it.  I think there is a gasket (copper) that comes with it.  You 
will lose coolant and you will have to re bleed the radiator.

And before you do anything, wait for Joel's opinion on this.
