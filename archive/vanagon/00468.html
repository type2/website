&gt; &gt; What about mileage range?  When I fill up when the guage reaches the red

&gt; &gt; My question is how far can one go on a full tank?  I know that it has a 16
&gt; &gt; gallon capacity.  What's with the other 4 gallons.  It it a safety margin?
&gt; 
&gt; In the area of mileage range, it's alway frustrated me that the gauge at 
&gt; half is nowhere near half full.  I've decided that the top of the red 
&gt; area is about 12 gallons for me too and that half is about 6 gallons.

This makes me feel better.  As a new Vasnagon owner I am still on my first
tank of gas.  I have put about 100 miles on the van since filling it up the 
first time and the gauge is just above 1/2 full.  Knowing the tank was 16 gal
I was hoping that the guage was not linear.  My commute to work is mixed 
freeway and city.  I am expecting to get around 18-20mpg not the 12.5mpg the
guage was indicating.
