Subject: screens revisited

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               screens revisited
My apologies to the group if this topic has been beat to a pulp with a wet
noodle, but I know of at least one person out there who requested this info, so
here goes...

Side window screens for the EV (and I think Vanagons too, since they appear 
pretty close, dimensionally) can be had from Country Homes Campers, San Jose,
CA.  Construction is of aluminum (frame) and steel mesh (screen). 
The actual manufacturer is some company in Ohio.  The quality looks decent
and is designed to be used with the window open (duh!), as opposed to being
mounted over the window.  It has felt on crucial edges so that the glass is 
not scratched.  Cost is $80/pair.

This firm specializes in camper conversions for T3's and T4's; if some of you
would like additional info, please e-mail me and I'll get back to you.
When I stopped by, they were working on an EV CL, GL, AND MV (!) for their
demo line, and their conversions are quite different from what Westfalia
does with their campers (more efficient use of available space, for one
thing).
