&gt;I wasn't looking at buses at the time, so I don't know if these &quot;smaller&quot;
&gt;engines were also available in breadloaf buses in these countries. In the
&gt;US, bug and bus engines from the same model year were always the same size
&gt;until 1972, weren't they? If that's also true of the overseas buses (don't
&gt;ask me), then there might well have been 1200cc or 1300 cc baywindows in
&gt;some of these countries. Buses needed bigger engines even more than bugs
&gt;did-- Maybe these overseas buses followed the same upgrade lines as US
&gt;buses did? Anyone know?

Although it does not indicate the country of destination, many of the
following 1300 &amp; 1600 engines were installed in breadloafs (Sometimes it pays
to keep the old parts catalogs and very outdated fiche films):

1300 Engines:  Series AB Case 71-73, Series AR Case 74-75 (Talk about
UNDERPOWERED!)

1600 Engines after 1971:  Series AF Case 72-73, Series AR Case (Low Comp
Pistons) 72-79, Series AS Case 74-79

Note:  All were Dual Oil Relief Piston Cases and Dual Port Cylinder Heads.
 I've seen a lot of rebuilt engines from various suppliers using the &quot;AB&quot;
Case from engines brought in from Europe - normally upgraded here to 1600.
