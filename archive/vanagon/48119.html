Another question.  Is this setup the same for the diesel tank?

&gt; sure the return line isnt kinked or clogged/collapsed? This would cause a

&gt; me know.

I have check the pressure and it's ok when the pump is ok.  ONce the pump
goes the pressure goes.  The return line isn't kinked, but it might be
clogged.  I'll check that.  On the other hand, if it was messed up, then the
pressure would be messed up all the time.  Hmmmm.  I wonder.
