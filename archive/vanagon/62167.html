&lt;&lt; Would running the AC in the extreme conditions (i.e., HOT!)
 have a 'disasterous' effect of the air-cooled engine ?
 What are the short- and long-term effects ? &gt;&gt;

A/C in an aircooled bus/Van is almost sure death. 
I have never even been in a aircooled bus/van that had working a/c, as the
compressor belt has always been off. On the aircooled vans and buses since
'72, the aircond was always installed after-the-fact, at the dealer. There is
no such thing as &quot;factory aircond.&quot; in a aircooled bus or van. All the a/c
compressors on the aircooled buses and vans were usually made my York
compressors of York, Pa. The York compressors were the same ones that were
used on other American behemouths such as Ford Galaxies and such.  They're
huge compressors, and put too much strain on the aircooled engine. VWOA must
have gotten a good deal with York to use their compressors without any regard
to lasting affects on the engines they were installed on. The majority of
aircooled buses and vans I see in junkyards with blown engines have the
dealer installed a/c units, and EVERY late bus I've seen in a junkyard with
an engine fire has had a/c....

just something to think about...
