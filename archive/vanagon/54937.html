Subject: RE: VANAGON EVENTS? Possible T2 parts 

I would check the LiMBO web site periodically:

		http://bcn_dot_net/~limbo/

Their events tend to focus on the East Coast, given it is run out of MA.

Nothing listed at this time, other than annual club meeting.

&gt;Does anyone know of any scheduled get togethers this summer? (hopefully
&gt;in the east) or any good organized trips scheduled?
&gt;  Also, thru someone at work who's parents have recently sold their
&gt;67 Westy but kept the luggage rack, ladder, and a tent that was only
&gt;used once. What is this stuff possibly worth? any ideas? Has anyone
&gt;used the old tents with their Vanagon?
