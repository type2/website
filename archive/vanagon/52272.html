&gt;Hi, Helmut
&gt;If you know of where to get the quad round headlight grille for the Vanagon 
in
&gt;Germany or South Africa, could you let me know of the address?
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;chris

For South African sources you may mail vwmaster(a)vw.co.za and ask for 
export
of spare parts. At present the guys in the export department have no e-mail
and it will need some days (to weeks) to get the answer. The grille they 
offer
are the two big headlights (the standard ones as you know) and two 
additional
smaller ones (beams or fog lights) in the size of the additionals of the 
Golf,
Jetta or Polo.

&gt;From German sources you will get also another style grilles, there are two 
round
headlights, as you know, and two additional in same size. For suppliers I 
have
to search first. I will post the addresses as soon as possible.
