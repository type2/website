!!what i would say is it sounds like you have a Kombi w/ some form of camping
_at__at_equipment (by the sounds of yours would be aftermarket or homemade). The
##general rule of thumb i use is

$$&quot;how professional does the conversion look?&quot;, do the cabinets look well put
%%together and stong, or are they just hokey plywood? Look at the hardware
^^fittings etc. Are they the sort of thing you pick up at a hardware store,
&amp;&amp;or are they the sort of thing that was specially made for the van? A bit of
**exploring should probably give you a good idea.

!!One final note, if you write to the factory w/ your VIN, you can get the
_at__at_definitive answer. BTW Westfalia conversions start out life as a Kombi, and
##will appear as so on documentation from the factory.

I have a '70 Kombi (#230... per Bentley) and, as I begin my restoration 
of it, I have noticed that the conversion the PO(s) put in is a real 
piece of crap!!  So I am literally peeling back the history of my Kombi, 
removing nasty carpet and rust, and I have noticed this:

No headliner, in the back originally.  The interior walls are also not 
VW.  It was originally all white, later painted tan.  The owner's manual is for
the &quot;Station Wagon.&quot;  

I originally faced a dilemna:  sell this, and buy a &quot;real&quot; camper?  I 
couldn't do it--I had resurrected this one from a VW boneyard and it has 
been nothing but loyal ever since.  So, after much blood (beat knuckles), 
sweat ('nuff said), and tears (of happiness, of course), I hope to have a 
serious road cruiser/camper.  Maybe start going on those wacky California 
bus-gatherings.
