I spent this weekend redoing the headliner and wall panels with the same
Baltic Birch wood that was used in the restoration of the '67 camper. These
panels were victims of the fallen wallpaper effect. I lived with it while I
drove it. It looks very nice! At this point I have decided to yank the
$1000. stereo and insert a basic AM/FM unit. This vehicle is totally rust
free and has approx 47,000 original miles on the 2.0L aircooled engine.
Outside of the birch panels all is OEM and near mint by any standard.
Contact via pmail if interested.
Still trolling around $6500. obo
~After shopping for a non-VW commuter vehicle I think this is a heck of a
vehicle for that amount. I was in total sticker shock!!!!!
