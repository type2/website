Subject: Re: water pump

&gt;
&gt;one way to tell for sure is to get a short section of tubing and put one end
&gt;to your ear and move the other end around the engine. if it is the water pump
&gt;making the noise, then the loudest (and clearest through the tube) will be
&gt;right round the pump area.

Ooohh!  Thanks Joel!  I can't wait to go to the farm and try this out!
I'm gonna stick a hose in my ear and listen to the engine.  (My in-laws
think I'm a basket case anyway...)  Maybe now I can figure out where 
that strange sound is coming from.  
(I'll leave the panties and bra at home :-)  )
