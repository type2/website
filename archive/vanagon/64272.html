Subject:      Propane Tank

Hello all,

I have a crack in my propane tank on my '84 Westy.  Does anyone know of a
cheaper place to acquire these tanks (dealer quoted $600 for a new one).  I
was also wondering if anyone has ever tried to patch or weld one of these
tanks to fix a crack.  Yes, I would completely drain the propane &amp; flush the
tank out first.

Thanks,
Mike D.
