&gt; Hey Danny,
&gt; 	Did you get stuff out of the SanDiego junkyard I told you about?
&gt; Just curious...
&gt; 
&gt; -David
&gt; 

David, hi, you bet!  I meant to thank you privately but lost your
email address.  The table I mentioned in my &quot;fricking headliner&quot;
post today came out of that poor beast you told me about.

I went down there last Thursday (kind of a hike from Redondo Beach)
and snaked the fold down table and the side flip table that was
bolted to the icebox.  Both of these pieces have trick, vintage
60's metal hinges, especially the card table.  The interior wood
seemed to be a homemade job, though, and the rest of the bus was
fairly well worked over.  The only thing left of any use is probably
the slotted side windows.  

Thanks again for the tip.  Your directions were perfect. 
I got drunk (well, thickly buzzed) in Dana Point (Heritage Brew Co.)
afterwards.  Didn't make it to work until 4:30, but, incredibly, had
a wonderfully productive evening for my boss.  Must've been the good
stoke from the table finds.

If you find anymore junkyard splits, please let me know.
