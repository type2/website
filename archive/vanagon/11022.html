Howdy,

	Tonight I solved the engineering problem of using fresh air heater
boxes and heater tubes with the early bus.  The problem was the tubes on
the body are smaller in diameter than the tubes that connect them to the
heater boxes, so when  I put the tubes on, the just sorta hung there.

	I took a spare tube with to to the hardware store, and bought a 
PVC pipe fitting that was designed to connect 2 1/2&quot; slip-fitting
pipe to 2 1/2&quot; threaded pipe.  I used my drill and 2&quot; wire brush attachment
to &quot;adjust&quot; the inside diameter of the pipe slightly.  The part I reamed
out fits over the tube on the body, and the tube from the heater box fits 
over the other end, making a snug fit. 

	I ended up improving the airflow by about 25% or so, proven by the
2nd batch of debris blown thru the tube.

	Tomorrow, I'll get some foam pipe insulation for the under-car tubes,
which should also improve the heating.

	This engineering project cost me $2.50 for materials and
about 20 minutes of labor!  Easiest part of the project by far!
