Cars I've Seen in Town:
         Chrysler: 1994 Viper (red, of course. French guy who works at
                        the local tire plant)
         Mercedes: 1993 600SL (red, of course. when the big-wig Germans
                        came over to announce the new Mercedes plant
                        to be built near here. it was 'borrowed' from
                        another dealer so the Germans could 'feel at
                        home' as they drove around. this is the one with
                        the V-12 engine.)
          Ferrari: 1992 512 Testa Rosa (red, of course. local doctor)
                   1993 512 Testa Rosa (red, of course. passed in on
                        the Interstate in Montgomery, AL ... he was
                        going the other direction. might have been Bo
                        Jackson.)
               VW: 1980 Vanagon with a Winnebago-type air conditioner
                        on top, run by a Kohler generator on the front
                        bumper.)
                   1967 Microbus, shortened by removing the middle doors
                        area and welding the two ends together. painted
                        in hippie-rainbow colors, of course.
