&gt;Hey all,
&gt;I was just curious as to what kind of Bosch fuel injection system was
&gt;used on late breadloaf buses ('75-'79).  Is it L-Jetronic or K-Jetronic?
&gt;What's the difference?  I read this somewhere before (in a Bosch FI
&gt;book) but now I can't remember.
&gt;

Try AFC for Air Flow controled.  Jetronic refers to the mechanical system
used on the watercooled cars of that era. Dennis.
