Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

&gt;First off, I agree that sticking some blonde with half her tits showing
 kind of degrades the VW Magazine in my eyes.

 On the other hand as long as VW Magazines are bought by mostly males
 the magazine editors will shoot cover shots of babes with cars. And 
 that's that. They know what guys think of every 30sec. and they want
 you to pick up their magazine and buy it. That's it.

 And let's face it ...most red blooded American males like looking
 at shapely women...but why must they always be blondes? :-)
