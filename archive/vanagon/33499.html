Subject: Semaphores


To All:

Yesterday while prowling a local junkyard (Interstate VW -  Used parts &amp;
cores -- 1303 Engineer Road, Vista, California, [619] 598-1376) I saw a tatty
white sedan with semaphores, sitting waiting to be dismantled or crushed.
 Owner's name is Jim.  If you need semaphores you might give him a call.

If you call him please take the time to mention where you heard of the parts.
 We've been trying to demonstrate the usefulness of the internet to Jim and
other local junkies.  Like most junkies, Jim makes his nut dismantling VW's
so as to provide a steady flow of cores to engine, tranny and head rebuilders
here in southern California.  He maintains a small stock of glass, fittings
and the like but only to satisfy a trickle of walk-in trade.  It's sad to see
the Westy interiors and pop-top parts go into the landfill or through the
crusher.  

Yesterday Jim had a number of splitties in his yard, a couple in drive-away
condition including a rather nice '67 camper with a teak interior and one of
those square European-style pop-tops..
