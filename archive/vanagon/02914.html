I noticed the coolest thing in my bus tonight!

I haven't driven it very much, just around the block a few times,
and I noticed that the tope 3&quot; of the windshield glass has &quot;flowed,&quot;
so I get this wavy view of the world as I drive!  Kinda takes me back 
to '67, when the world was a different place...

BTW - I guess this means I'll have to get safari's to replace them with :)
