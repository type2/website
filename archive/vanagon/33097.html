Subject: speedometer error

My 70 westy has a rev counter and the speedo correlates well showing 18 mph
per 100 rpm, the problem is that when I show 65 mph every is flying past me
and I must be only doing 55-60
I read somewhere that the 196*14 tyres are too small and the speedo reads
fast. Does anyone know the correct fudge factor or the correct tyre size.
