Hello Vananauts,

Does anyone have any experience with the Magnaspark CB HEI system 
from CB Performance.  It was featured in the latest issue of DB&amp;HVW
on Page 44.  I talked to my brother-in-law mechanic and he simply said
&quot;what are you waiting for?&quot;  My '74 Westy is running an 1800 cc pancake
with a Weber 2bbl.  Is this a good system for this set up?

Any input about this type of system would be greatly appreciated.  It looks
like a great opportunity to toss the old points right in the dumper.

Thanks 

Mark White
