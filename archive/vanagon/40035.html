Subject: MSRP prices dor 1990 Vanagons wanted


Vanatics,
I am compiling a Model Year Summary for USA Vanagons for 1990 and would like
to inlcude the MSRP for the vans and all of the options.  If anyone has an
original window sticker or other reliable price data, I'd love to hear from
you.


Thanks,
