Subject: NM--&gt;MI VW pipeline...


        I got this message from a fellow who saw a web page of mine.  He's
a Michigander in new Mexico and says that he's willing to bring/ship VWs
when he returns this spring.  He says that he also knows buses... used to
own a '69.

        Don't know him personally, all the usual (&amp; unusual;) disclaimers
apply.  I don't know if he's out to do favors or make some dough on the
side.  Would advise anyone who's going to purchase remotely to review
Hoover's Grendel saga. :)  He has given me permission to post this freely.
Please direct responses to John.  Good luck!

&gt;Hey Greg, How's Michigan treating you this winter? My name is John
&gt;Feyers and I'm a Michigan Native myself, however, I decided to spend
&gt;this winter down in sunny New Mexico. It's great we've already seen
&gt;70 degrees in Feb. So anyway the reason I'm sending this is that I'm
&gt;in VW HEAVAN down here. Talk about tons of rust-free air suckers.
&gt;I'm trying to hook up with anybody in Michigan that is looking for
&gt;some nice vw's. I personally have a nice 67 bug that I'm looking to
&gt;sell, and I can obtain any number of other vw's. I have access to
&gt;5(five) oval window bugs ranging from early to late 50's (these are
&gt;all rustfree project cars, most will run but may not have original
&gt;engines) I also may be picking up an all original 59 bug owned by a
&gt;&quot;little old lady&quot; its been in her garage for years!
&gt;If you know of anyone that may have some interest in any of these
&gt;cars you can E-mail me - jfeyers_at_bod1.tvi.cc.nm_dot_us
&gt;I will be moving back to Michigan in May and I can probably arrange
&gt;to have any of these cars shipped. My fiance and I will probably be
&gt;driving a couple vws home in May also.
&gt;
