Subject:  vented catalytic propane heater wtb

as it warms up, i'm thinking i might find a deal on a heater for camping as
well as mobile use when it gets cold again.  i've seen dave garth's setup
(excellent job, but probably slightly overkill for my needs) on david
schwarze's page, and am wondering if anyone knows of a good
source(s) for heaters/etc., and what the pricing might be like. 

thanks, matthew
