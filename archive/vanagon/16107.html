Subject: Re: Syncro Tranny Lube Questions

&gt;&gt;The reason I ask is that after hearing such glowing reports, I was going to
&gt;&gt;have the tranny drained and refilled with Swepco 201.

Me too!

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;VW in its official obscure literature indicates that synthetic is OK for the
&gt;front final drive unit but does not list synthetic as being permissable for
&gt;the rear unit.

Must be due to the gearbox then. ???

&lt;snip&gt;

I just phoned the dealer, and got an immediate NO! to synthetic oil for 
tranny etc. in VW and Audi, &quot;It burns the bearings&quot; was the response. I have 
been trying to locate Swepco 201 here with no luck yet. I really can't 
understand how Porsches can use synth. while VW can't. I bet all the 
bearings are made by FAG in both cars. I have heard of synth being too 
'slippery' for the synchronizers to work well, but that was one instance 
only. Every other report has been glowing.  Should I go buy some Castrol at 
KMart now???  concerned, tim s.
