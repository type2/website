&gt; diesel Vanagon's are rare anyway, but to convert to gas just
&gt; pushes the species closer to extinction......arggghhhh!
&gt; 
&gt;         What's the scoop, Gerry?  Does the diesel motor exhaust
&gt; bring out your allergies, or are you just frustrated with the
&gt; turtle power of that little powerplant?  Is the diesel on its last
&gt; legs anyway?  What would thrill me is to hear you were going
&gt; to put in a turbo-diesel (as I have done) in order to give some
&gt; dignity to diesel Vanagons.  Am I fighting a losing battle?

Turbo diesel swap! Sweet music to my ears. Perhaps you could
enlighten us with a writeup of the swap. If you have pictures
even better. I'm sure there are a lot of people willing to put
the up for examination on their WWW sites. 

Did you swap in the old 1.6 TD or the newer 1.9? Or even a TDI?

In particular I'm curious:

-- How did you make the turbo and turbo waste-gate clear the
   engine mounting tubes? (Assuming you swapped it into a non
   turbo diesel)

-- What did you do about the intake? Not much room on the left side
   for both intake manifold and air filter, ducts etc.

-- What's the best search regions in the US for low milage turbo
   diesel wrecks? Perhaps Canada is better. Any trouble bringing
   an engine across the border? How much did you pay?

PS While riding around Tu&quot;bingen on bike with a friend, at a red light I 
came upon a vanagon with a &quot;TDI&quot; decal on the back. I almost rode up and 
knocked on the drivers window, but remembered that not all vw owners
are &quot;excited&quot; about their vehicles as much as I am, and I didn't want
to embarrass my friend by acting too crazy. 

There seem to be German companies advertising both TDI and VR6 swaps
for the vanagon. (As far as I understand with my poor German)

   Martin:

	   Thanks for the information for retreiving old messages.

	   Do you at least have in your out box your message to me,
    sent to the list 14 may?  All that I have of that message is:

   &gt;Turbo-diesel swap! Sweet music to my ears. Perhaps you could&lt;

   thanks

   P.S. Given the time listed for receipt of your last message to me,
   are you located in eastern Europe? (Zulu plus two hours?)

No, I'm in Sweden. Perhaps same time zone as parts of eastern Europe.
