&gt;
&gt;Having seen some mention of this in the list I thought I'd share with you
&gt;something I received from a German friend today......
&gt;&quot; The beetle was the first type of car built by VW after 1945. The
&gt;transporter
&gt;was their second type, built from 1950. So....all beetles are type 1's, and
&gt;all transporters are type 2's. Type 3 (1500, 1600) were built as a third
type
&gt;of car 1961 - 73. Type 4 (411, 412) were built as a fourth VW type 1968 -
74.
&gt;Within type 2's (Transporters 1950 - 1995) there were four generations:
&gt;T1 1950 - 67
&gt;T2 1967 - 79
&gt;T3 1979 - 90 (&quot;syncro&quot; - 92?)
&gt;T4 1990 -
&gt;Simple eh?&quot;
&gt;Well I thought it was till I got this! So am I a type 2/type 1 with my
Split?
&gt;Oh well it's all type 2 to me .....love and peace...Dave and Cee and SSVC
&gt;
&gt;

This sounds neither Germanic nor logical.  Since late and early Transporters
are generically linked the usual German approach would probably be to use
letters to designate sub-types,
Type IIa - splities
Type IIb - '68 through whatever
 Type IIc- and so on.

Personally, if it don't look like a DC-3 I ain't gonna fly it :-)
