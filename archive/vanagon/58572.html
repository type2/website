Subject: syncro problem index?

Hey Folks,
	I'm looking at a syncro in my area and I need some advice.  I'm trying to
figure out the possible problems I might encounter while owning one of these
machines.  I've read alot of info on the head problems on all vanagons, but
what about the syncro drivetrain?  A local owner said that the cv's go all the
time, do other owners have the same experience?   A vanagon dealer I talked to
also said that 90% of the syncros that went thru his organization needed tranny
work or replacement.  Do list folks feel the same? What about the viscous
couplings?  They have been mentioned on the list as a $4000 fix but does it go
often or just in a blue moon?
	I'm also looking for advice on what to look at when test driving a syncro.  I
looked at the Westphalia syncro page and read some interesting stuff there but
I can use all the info I can find.  Thanks for all the good info I've already
received from this list and I hope to hear from you soon.
