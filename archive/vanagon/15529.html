&gt; &gt;&gt;	Does the solenoid rely on contact with the body for its ground, or
&gt; &gt;&gt;is it s'posed to have another ground wire hooked up to it?

&gt; &gt;The body.  Is the transaxle strap in good condition?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't _have_ a trans strap - I'm using a solid trans mount.  Solid meaning
&gt; all steel.  It sucks, but thats what ya gotta do to get a tunnel case
&gt; trans in a splitcase bus.

Hmmm. I must have the solid mount, but I'm pretty sure I have the trans 
strap too. You can never have too many grounds, ya know...

I'll go look this weekend...
