i just got a bunch of stuff from Hella in the mail today at lunch, and
they are still showing the wheel covers in their sales literature. they
have several models:

design     colour               14&quot;

GS         silver              40816
           white               40836
GS-C       chrome              20826

GL         silver              40821
           white               40840

GTS        silver+anthracite   40861
GLS        silver+anthracite   40851

&quot;All white wheel trim models can be easily painted to any car colour.&quot;

the GL looks like the 88-91 vanagon covers, the GS/GS-C look like the
86-91 mercedes stock wheels (not the S-models). the GLS is kinda wierd
looking ... i don't think i can describe it. and the GTS looks like the
blades on a Norelco electric shaver. really.

so ... maybe they are still around. maybe not. if you really want to dress
up (down?) your bus, might be worth checking on. :)
