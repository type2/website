Subject:       Re: Canuck Vanagon Oddities


&gt; Of course I don't have a Vanagon, but I can't say that I've ever heard of 
&gt; one with a smoke alarm.  Where do they put it, and what's the rationale 
&gt; for it?  I mean, if you're in the Vanagon, then you're likely to see 
&gt; smoke.  
&gt; 
Hello Bradley.  The smoke alarm (just a small Dicon house alarm 9 
volt model) mounts under the rear cabinets on the passenger side.. it 
is located just behind the rear seat.  Hope this description makes 
sense.  It's law here to have smoke alarms in RV's, and all units  must be 
equipped with them prior to sale..  It doesn't really work  well in the
Westfalia as it is relatively small, and there isn't enough air circulation.  
The outcome is once your toast is just starting to turn brown, the stupid
 thing goes off in your ear.  A few episodes of that, and that 9 volt
 battery got pitched :)  No problems now.  I have even heard these 
things going off in 26 footers at 0700... talk about external alarm 
clocks :(

Government, trying hard to save us from ourselves and ticking 
everyone off in the process....

Harry.
