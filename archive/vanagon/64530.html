&lt;&lt;  I contrast this to the 1985 Corolla that I pulled a interior door
 panel from for my wife's 87.  It is allways disconcerting to see the
 blood still on the cars in the junkyard, though this person obviously
 wasn't wearing a seatbelt.  In addition, I shot a wreck in on 20/59 in
 Birmingham, Alabama where 40 foot long sewer pipe rolled off a flatbed
 and over the median, literally tearing in half an 87 Corolla identical to
 my wife's, killing the driver. &gt;&gt;

Thanks for confirming my gut instinct (maybe some study of physics in
college?). Suzy's new daily driver is the 1976 van because
(#1) she loves it, &amp;
(#2) the sliding door from the van weighs as much as her (former) 1992
Corolla LE!!! The first time I rode in her car, I felt like I was riding in a
disposable aluminum turkey roasting pan. It HAD to go.

Safe Suzy = Happy me.

Thanks to all who responded with words of assurance,
