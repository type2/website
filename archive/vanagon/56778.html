&gt; Anyway, for a quick, dirty fix, just pull (and leave unconnected) the

&gt; precisely on the fitting which connects the radiator return and the
&gt; thermostat bypass hoses. 

I should have mentioned that this will inhibit the temperature
shutoff.  Instead of waiting for dash board pre glow light to go out 
just count 10 seconds (or 15-20 if it is cold), and then start the engine. 
The glow plug current will turn off:

 1/ When the engine is started or
 2/ After approximately 60s if engine is not started.

However it is worth verifying that the voltage is off when the 
engine is running. Use a voltmeter or a testlight.
