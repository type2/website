Subject: spare tire part needed for splittie

I am looking for a plate that holds the spare tire into the well of the
bench style splittie bus. I believe that it slips on to the threaded piece
that is permantly attached to the bench divider. Any condition will do. Does
this piece just slip into place and is secured by a nut or is the piece
threaded? Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks,
