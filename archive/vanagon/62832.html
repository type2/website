Subject: help! running rough

Well, my 84 has yet another problem(or is it the same one as before in a 
different guise?)  
On the way into school this morning, I first heard a noticable change in 
the idle, it was much rougher, starting to sputter.  I continued to drive 
and it started losing power, sputtering along. I pulled over and let it 
idle, giving it gas and it would sputter and then would sound ok when it 
reached higher rpm's (although it wouldn't do this when in gear)

My guesses:  
1 - I has a power failure problem a month ago and replaced the 
ignition coil, the problem seemed to go away.  Todays problem was 
completly different thought because before, my van would die just like if 
i turned the key off.

2- bad fuel filter.  I would probably just go out and replace this except 
that I just replaced it 6 weeks ago and cant imagine it being bad this 
early.

3- Out of gas??  Could my gauge be that far off? (I doubt it)

Please help me get back on the road!!

Thanks in advance

Blake
