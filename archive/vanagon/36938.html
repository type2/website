&gt;The tranny won't shift into 4th and is very difficult to shift into 3rd. 1-2

Sounds like the 3-4 slider hub to me also.  Not a job to tackle yourself.
Especially if in a hurry.  With time and specila tools, you probably can.  If
you wish to try it yourself, get a used tranny to put yours back on road
while you learn.
