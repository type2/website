Subject: Re: EV tire recommendations...and EV Synchros

Ric, in tire search mode, sez:

&gt;I would like to replace them with an all season M&amp;S type tire...
&gt;what suggestions...they are 205/65 R 15s....

To which I say:

Our EV came w/ Michelin MXLs in the same size (205/65R/15); they're M+S rated
(not S&amp;M, but you could always give it a try, Ric  ;-)  ), and they're re-
inforced (for truck-like usage, I suppose).
They handle pretty well in the dry/wet and don't squeal too much at the limit.

Considering you lasted this long on Conti's, I think you'd like the Michelins.

Tell you what, when you get your Synchro, why don't you slap some 225/45/17
rubber on some Opus One wheels and we'll take it for a spin, eh?


your bud on the opposite coast,
