Subject: Vanagon List Fund-Raising

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

&quot;Listees:
&gt;
&gt;The Ron and Chris Vanagon List fund-raising activity,  the program to
&gt;raise money for the cost of operation of the Vanagon List, seems to have
&gt;Friend Lussier passing the hat, frequently, in a supplicative manner. 
&gt;
&gt; His and Chris's time, and begging talents, might be spent better in
&gt;soliciting equipment, software and the other components necessary to keep
&gt;alive, to me, this vital activity. 
&gt;
&gt;They have demonstrated, already,  that they are gifted in technical
&gt;expertise and in acquiring and purchasing  the arcane supplies and
equipment needed
&gt;to keep the lights burning on the Vanagon List.
&gt;
&gt;This Vanagon List is a cooperative activity in the strictest sense, one of
&gt;the more generous I've observed. We all provide, and receive, from the
List
&gt;mutual aid and comfort in the form of information, opinion, and individual
&gt;support and diagnosis in &quot;down&quot; times.  It is time for those of us who
have
&gt;yet to respond to the call to listen up and to open up the purse and to
make the payment .  About one person in five on the List has heard the call
for , and sent the funds necessary.
&gt;
&gt;A Vanagon historically fails, as most of know, to provide a free ride. So
I suggest that we
&gt;add the minimal member's cost of operation of the Vanagon List to our ever-
-
&gt;expanding itemizations of bucks, francs, marks, yen, kroner, pounds and
&gt;wampum for parts, labor, books, travel and, in some cases, if I read the
&gt;posts correctly, beer, necessary to keep our special vehicles on the road.
&gt;
&gt;We've all yet to find a free lunch, or a free ride, especially in a
&gt;Vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;Write and mail that  US$ 3.00 check today.   (Or go to the post office and
buy the Universal
&gt;Money Order.) And send it to Lussier at :
&gt;
&gt;10164 Parkwood Drive #8 Cupertino, CA 95014-1533
&gt;
&gt;With curmudgeonly thanks,
&gt;
