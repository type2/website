Subject: Re: Mug Bug

I met one of the guys who  put these mug bugs together.   He did the
interiors.

but his main things is finding stright rust free splits in the Bay Area and
tarting them up with new paint and interior, mechanically fixing them, and
selling them to people in Japan for many bucks.  Can you believe $15,000 for
a mid sixties non sunroof deluxe?!    It boggles the mind.
