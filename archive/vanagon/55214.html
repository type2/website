&gt; There is a pronounced squeak emanating from under the front
&gt; passenger seat |on 89 Westy. Squeaks regardless of whether or not a
&gt; passenger is seated. Any suggestions?

My '87 GL developed a squeak like that when it was 2-3 years old. It 
turned out that the upper control arm bushings were worn out already. 
The noise does not always seem to happen over bumps, so it stumped me 
for a while.
