Subject: Re: Interstate Batteries Researched &amp; Purchased

I am planning to add the second battery to my 87 westy in the near future.
 How much do I have to modify the compartment behind the driver's seat to
accomodate the battery?  Also, do you have to &quot;tie&quot; the battery down?  I was
hoping to be able to put the battery in a plastic marine battery case.  Has
anyone found a decent battery that would fit in a plastic case and still fit
in this compartment?  I do have swivel seats.  How much should I expect the
dealer to charge me to set up this system?  Finally, if I just put the batter
in and the terminals touch the metal top of the compartment will I have a
problem?

Thanks for the advice
