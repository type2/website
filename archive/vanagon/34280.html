Subject: Re: VANS! VANS! on video?

Don't mention the copy*******aagh!
I have tried to get stuff on VHS tape copied for NEATO but you guys use a
different system and it costs about 30 dollars minimum over here for me to get
a firm to do a copy you can play...so...I am willing to provide a video copy
on English system to someone willing to get it transfered and make it
avaikable AT COST to list members...or NEATO members...I can bung on footage
of buses in Bad Camberg (Wow with the '56 ladder truck doing its stuff for
SSVC), footage of Venlo (brief as it was one of THOSE weekends..blur blur) and
a weird short taken at SSVC major meet and convoy of 80 plus Splitties on the
motorway plus unrehearsed interviews that startvas Dave leaps on unsuspecting
owner and says say hello to America and Germany and tell us about your van in
2 mins...cruel or what...yes I did live!
Anyway...someone out there must have the equipment? Over to you...Dave
