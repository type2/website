Subject: DC Area-Pop-Top, Anyone?


In yesterdays Want AD (July 18 issue):

        '71 VW Bus Pop Top. W/O canvas, perfect condition. $75.00
        (703) 476-0486 (Herndon, Virginia)

This is cheap for somebody that wanted to convert their &quot;normal&quot; bus to a
camper-type. GO FOR IT!!

If somebody really wanted it bad, I could be persuaded to go get it for them...
