Subject: Bentley Manuals and 82 aircooled Vanagon

With all the obvious enthusiaasm for Bentley manuals, I decided to
investigate. Even with the currently strong Australian dollar, the
price for the manual for the 82 Transporter (Vanagon) is equivalent
to &gt;USD200.  I finally received Bentley's catalogue, and their letter
gave  details of the specific manual I need.  (&quot; . . :1980-1991). 
That was fine until I read the catalogue which implies the manual
covers only the water-cooled engine.  Is this the case?  I have an
air-cooled engine. In Australia, water-coled engines didn't arrive
until about 1984?.  I don't want to go to the expense (cost +
US$42postage) of getting the manual here and finding it is not the
right one. 
Can anyone comment please? Thanks,  David Yates
