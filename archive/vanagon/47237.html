Ah! Canadian customs.
My kids are in Seattle with their grandparents.  Try getting into 
Canada with someone else's kids! even if they are your own 
grandkids.  Can't complain too much though, they are trying to 
keep the wrong people from 'escaping' the US with kids they shouldn't 
have.  You need birth certificates (originals) letters from parents, 
and several other documents.
They are leaving today for Vancouver to visit relatives.
