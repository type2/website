Subject: AD: 85 Westie for sale, Aspen, CO

I saw this ad today in the local paper, the Aspen Times:

1985 Westfalia
Tan, 145,000 miles.  Good Condition.
$6000 firm.  Call Tom at 970-925-2600

I have nothing to do with this van and I don't know the seller.  However,
salt is not used on the roads here in Colorado so there is suprisingly
little rust on all the cars.  The body may have no corrosion to speak of.
