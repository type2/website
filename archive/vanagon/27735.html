Subject: D-lux windows (longish diatribe ;-))

Been home the last few days tending an ailing family member and well, today I
got bored waiting around to play ambulance service. So I brought the room
monitor (help! I've fallen....) out to the shop and started poking through the
various &quot;next project&quot; boxes that didn't float off in the last Florida Huricane.

Nope, didn't wanna install that min-sat dish I bought at the flea market, and
wasn't up for dusting off the solar powered weed wacker,didn't think I had
the time to get real dirty or play mechanic on one of the flock. Besides my
grandmother would have made me wash my hands and brush my hair before I took her
and her stroke to the hospital for treatment so greasy was out. Hmmm...Hey! I
know just the thing, couple of weekends ago I snarfed some WCM gaskets for the
Deluxe at the VolksFolks ReUnion down in Titusville. Three pair of
windsheild gaskets and a complete set of &quot;opera window&quot; gaskets which I had
intended to install once the nose-clip/face-lift (see previous long post
project) was over.

I had noticed the top left rear glass was wiggling around in a side to side type
motion amongst the crumbling shreds of 30 year old gasket material a few months
ago and had penciled the gasket surgery in for a.s.a.p.. I'd marveled then
the cost for original &quot;replacement&quot; opera windows for Claire were around
125.00 each at the last Lakeland show and this made my good glass a 1000.00
investment I intended to wrap in nice new West Coast Metric rubber soon.
Course, this was way
back in March or something like that and life had, well, just snuck up on me too
fast.

So anyway, It's a pretty Fallish day, crisp (70+/- degrees for us Floridians is
considered crisp) and clear finally.  I think to myself, &quot;Hmmm I got a couple of
spare opera gaskets in case I need an extra, and I do need to replace at least
the one wiggly window so's why don't I just razor snick off the last vestige of
old gasket and try out just one of the new rubbers?&quot;  Grandma sounded like she
was not gonna wake up any time soon (help! I've fallen...) as I set the monitor
on the dash of Claire and walked into the shop to procur a gasket and a sharp
knife......

jump ahead to early afternoon

Okay,
So I got a little carried away and now have all eight opera windows sitting in
my shop, the windsheilds are popped out, I've rolled up my sleeves,unpacked
the porta-power &quot;Jaws-O-life&quot; body tools and have halfway completed
remodeling the
washer-dryer impaled nose of the bus.

I'm wishing at the moment it was Spring Equinox instead of almost Halloween as
my beautiful autumn day is quickly turning twilight and I've got a hell of
a mess to clean up before nightfall. Its been too long since I worked on
Claire
and I've missed the feeling of being absorbed in the machinations of machinery!

Odd how a slight change in weather, a few bits of new goodies, and a little
free time can alter a persons perspective. I wonder if I'll have enough time
tomorrow to swap the front-end out for my disc'd brake version...&quot;Uh..Grandma
why don't you stay in bed a few more days?&quot;, &quot;I don't mind really!!&quot;
