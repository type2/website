Subject: busses &amp; drive-ins

     Just reminiscing...back in the early 60's my old man had a commercial 
     laundry downtown Cleveland and he would bring one of the VW busses, no 
     windows, home for the weekends in the summer.  We'd use it for family 
     outings, especially drive-in movies.  We'd pile in with lawn chairs, 
     baskets of food and such.  He'd park it sideways, taking up two spaces 
     and throw open the cargo doors.  The kids would sit outside on a 
     blanket, he and Mom would kick back in lawn chairs inside the bus.  It 
     was very cool.  One of my favorite family memories.
