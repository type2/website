Subject: Re: Dennis' opinion of emmision mods/Ed&quot;s Soapboxing(long)

Oh Dennis, dont worry, I'm not offened.In fact I appreciate intelligent input
and an adversarial point of view(should have been a lawyer
right.....NOT!)Calif had the VOC tightening laws about 10 years
ago...couldn't even buy lacquer for cars or cabinets.I am in total agreement
with the environmentalists, there is far too much pollution, I just feel the
gov. has become way too much of a police force in regulating, sometimes the
small things that dont contribute grossly, and letting some high powered,
read that BIG MONEY, corporations slip by.I mean, what does it matter if,
when your 1991  vanagon engine blows, if you install a 1984 long block.In
Calif. this is not permitted.That is stupid.Calif,in particular, does an
immense amount of overregulating needlessly, just for the sake of
regulating.They have the BIG BROTHER complex down pat.It is a shame.(God
Dennis, stop me from soapboxing).

Anyway, you are right about testing under load.That is why the new EPA
standards call for testing on a dyno, so they can somewhat simulate real
world active road load conditions and ability to test NOX which they cant
test reliably w/o dyno.It is possible that the CO will rise under heavy load
due to the vaccum in the press. reg.
I suppose it would be interesting to see how much it rises.You can check w/ a
meter at standstill, but this wouldnt be realistic.Let me know what you
think.See Ya.
