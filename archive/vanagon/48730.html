&gt;Help.

&gt;While dirving at highway speed my 89 Westy will suddenly loses power for 
&gt;2-3 seconds. After the lurch the engine runs fine the rest of the trip. 
&gt; This symptom happens occasionally- say three times in a month. Its 
&gt;taking away the fun on driving.  
&gt;
&gt;Does any one have any ideas?
&gt;
Try replacing the (blue) temp sensor mounted on the thermostat housing - it
should be ~ $12. This has caused intermittant grief on two Digifant f.i.
vehicles I've worked on in the last two weeks.  (Also look in the archives
for the wiring loom addition to the flapper housing).
