&gt;&gt;The Craftsperson (9)44543 has a 1/2 inch drive not 3/8ths.
&gt;&gt;I would still recommend it tho.
&gt;&gt;It can be used with a 1/2-3/8ths adaptor.  With a minimum torque of 
&gt;&gt;20 &quot;lbs, It is a very diverse torque wrench.

Vanagon cylinder head bolts are torgued at 26 ft-lbs. So this torgue wrench
is not really suitable for vanagon engine rebuild works. I got a Craftsman
digi-torgue with torgue ranges from about 6 ft-lb up to about 100 ft-lb (not
sure about the high number). This torgue wrench has a 3/8 head. I bought it
quite many years ago form Sears catalogue for $40+.
