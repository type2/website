Subject: Re: window frame parts problem solved

     On this subject of windows and frames - do you have ANY ideas as to 
     how the winding mechanism fits into the door - I've been puzzling over 
     this for four months!!!!!! 
     Any top tips would be dead good.

Well some of you will remember my problem, which was the PO 
lost some crucial window frame parts, and I, never having 
owned a bus before, didn't even know they were missing 
until I posted some puzzled inquiries to this very list
(thanks to Lee Griffiths and Michael Heron and others) after 
which at least I knew what I needed to find.
     
So, at the Toledo show last weekend, I scored a complete 
set of doors, with glass (I needed one ventwing, too) from 
a '65 or so, for $20.  A fine swapmeet technique is to
buy your really heavy stuff right near the end, and the guy 
will think about hauling those doors back into his
garage and you'll get them cheap.  Almost scored a tranny for $75 
but somebody else got it, which is OK because somebody
else overheard me talking about needing a tranny and said to 
come by his house and get one for $50.  (I'm going to get
it next week, I'll keep you posted).
     
Anyway, all the window parts I needed were there, (and, in 
one of those amazing VW coincidences, the one piece missing
from the frame was the one piece I actually happened to have :) ), 
and I even got the frame off the door with only a few
days of Liquid Wrench, my new breaker bar (can you say 
torque, boys and girls?) and a little strategic drilling.
