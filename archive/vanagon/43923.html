&gt;You guys are coming dangerously close to discovering the real secret
&gt;of the V6anagon. The blurb about more cubic inches producing more power
&gt;is just a smokescreen. It's actually the &quot;V&quot; shape of the V6 engine,
&gt;closely approximating the mysterious pyramid shape, that makes it faster
&gt;than a speeding bullet etc.
&gt;
&gt;I'm sorry you found this out-- now I'll have to kill you to keep the
&gt;secret safe.   =:-O                                               ,

Since the &quot;V&quot; shape is inverted would'nt that cause the molecular cohesion
to reverse and inhibit the particle frow resulting in a reduction in a net
loss of horse power?

baffle them with bull sh*t.
