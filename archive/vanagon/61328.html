Malcolm, our Westy has the artificial rain gutters bolted on. We haul a
canoe but mostly two Aquaterra Prism Kayaks. Either package nets 100 lbs
and is too heavy to lift the top. I like this set up becaused it makes
life easier when I DO pop the top. This is our second Westy with this
setup and it works great. No leaks, no probs. Kit Carter 85 Westy GL
