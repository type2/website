Subject: Low RPM drift/surge, what is it?


I have an '87 GL Wolfs. I have not had it very long. It seems to run rough
at low RPMs. It idles at about 800. If I try to nudge it up to 1100 or
1200 RPM it seems to drift and surge. 

Is this characteristic of anything in particular?

Thanks and aloha,

Gordon Smith
