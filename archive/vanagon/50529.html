That's nothin'! As I was mounting various eyelets in my '86 Vanagon, to
bungee-down the camp stove, water bottle, chill box, etc. I managed to
drill a hole right through the steel wall at the rear of my battery
compartment and also through the battery itself. Needless to say, I had a
very surprised look on my face as electrolyte (sulphuric acid) started
leaking through the hole and burning a groove in my upholstery. 

This all happened at a friend's house, so now he knows that I am a
complete idiot.

I managed to remove my holed battery in record time without the aid of a
bicycle tube or any other device. I then tilted it so that no more acid
was leaking out of the hole. The repair consisted of Bondo and a goodly
amount of electrical tape wrapped around the entire battery to hold the
Bondo in place. 60,000 miles later it was still leak-free. The five gallon
water container is mounted so that the burned upholstery is not easy to
see. My friend still gives me that &quot;I know you're a moron&quot; look every once
in awhile.
