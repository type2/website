&gt;Speaking of replacement seats, the used car price guides list leather seats
&gt;as an option for the more recent (88-92) Vanagons.  I've never seen that
&gt;on either Vanagons or Westphalias, not even on &quot;Wolfsburg Editions&quot;.
&gt;Is that an option that VWoA-North Central ducked, but that some of the
&gt;other regions got?

i think that's a misprint/misread ... it might mean leather seats on one of
the other vw models, but the only leather seats i've ever heard of in a bus
was from Oettinger or Project Zwo (??spelling??) .. aftermarket customizers
in germany.
