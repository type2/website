Subject: blue coolant?
Date: Sat, 9 Apr 1994 18:01:13 -0700 (PDT)

&gt; ALL water-cooled buses have had to have the water pump replaced. no big deal.
&gt; but if no records, how do you know? sales-droid say-so?  what is the color
&gt; of the coolant in the little white tanks? it had better be blue!!! if it is
&gt; yellow or green, that means they are using a coolant that contains phosphate
&gt; which is NOT recommended by vw. (if you want, i'll send you my notes on the
&gt; coolant).

Blue?  I just bought mine (84 gl) from a dealer and it has regular old
green in it.  Is this serious?!

&gt; check the rear hatch struts. they go bad and cost a lot ... $50 each. use
&gt; that to knock down the price.

Does anyone know of a less expensive source for these?

&gt; does it have the 'weekender' pkg? rear seat folds down into a bed.

I need to hit the junkyards and find one of these or someone who wants to
swap for perfect condition brown.  :)


Thanks,
