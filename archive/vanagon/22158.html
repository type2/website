Subject: bye for now...

Well, the bus ('65 deluxe) is once again on the road.  Just to 
breifly recap:  Shift couple went (sponge shifting to no shifting).  Upon
replacing, noticed front transaxle mount was broken (not very obvious by
merely looking at it). Almost at the same time generator bearing was going.
Pulled engine, replaced transaxle with rebuilt from Transform.  Found old
nose cone was toast. Replaced.  Found outer upper bearing in reduction gear
on pass. side was gone. Replace.  Assembled.  Added a little gas to carb.
Started right up but would not get gas.  Switched hose hook-ups on fuel
pump (replaced all hoses with stock 5mm german) Started, runs great.  
Leaving for Arlington, VA for conference tomorrow.  Thanks everyone for the
help.  University gives me little disk space so I have to sign off for the 
week to avoid the dreaded &quot;Exceeded Disk Space Alloted&quot; Warning...
Thanks agin,

christian
