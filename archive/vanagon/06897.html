&gt;
&gt;&gt;I always thought Ph.D. stands for Doctor of Philosophy (in latin, of
&gt;&gt;course) and J.D. stands for Juris Doctor ...
&gt;
&gt;Yes that is true, and it is implied that there are degrees behind those
&gt;doctorates...however in certain places, Alahbamah for instance I am
&gt;told that certain grouping of letters have more than one meaning and
&gt;perhaps down there in Alahbamah one may have to add the word &quot;degree&quot;
&gt;after those letter designations. I'm talking about the following:
&gt;
&gt;Term			Alahbamah Definition
&gt;PhD			Post Hole Digger
&gt;BS			Bull Shit
&gt;MBA			Master Baiter Association (a fishing club)
&gt;JD			Jewish Doctor
&gt;BA			Big Ass (as in Big Ass truck...)

As someone who comes from further north (and east) than Yankeeland and
lives fuh-ther south than Alybamy, I would venture that perhaps those
aren't the only words one needs to attach extra explicative words to in
order to make them clearer in their meaning to residents of certain
sunnier climes, not that their existential meaning (or lack thereof) is
an indication of education (or lack thereof) in the philosophical study
of receptacles for vertical property dividers, bovine scatology, fishing
communities, kosher proctologists (yes, it is possible to jold both a JD
and a BA, though not neceselery in that order) or means anything at
all.  Did this clear anything up? &lt;vbg&gt;

Bandwidthwastingly yours,
Joachim
