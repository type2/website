Subject: How 'bout a news group

&gt;Hi all! New to this group (but not to internet or VWs).
&gt;
-snip-
&gt;
&gt;What say the rolling public? (I'm sure I'm not the only one to have
&gt;suggested this; just the most recent).
&gt;
&gt;Enjoy,
&gt;Dave

Geez people!  Give the guy a break!  You'd think he's asked us to share a
group with alt.chrysler.shitbox or compared his VW to a Ford Econoline.  In
the last 24 hours this person helped me to solve a valve timing problem with
my Rabbit (thank God I didn't post a help message here), and as a result I
still have hair on my head.
Not a techie group?  Transplants, braking problems, emmisions discussions.
No techie crap here, we just have BBQ's...
