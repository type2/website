Subject: RE: anyone know of any great west coast junkyards?

&gt;there is a (supposedly) big junkyard that advertises in European Cars. it's
&gt;either Campbells in Nelson, WA or Nelsons in Campbell, WA (i can't
remember
&gt;which!).

The junkyard is part of Campbell Nelson VW (a dealership) in Edmonds, WA
(suburb north of Seattle) to be exact. They can be reached at (206)
524-6600.
