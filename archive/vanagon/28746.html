Subject: Parts Wish List

hey now,

i've come by a little $$$ that i'm gonna use to do some needed work on my 74
transporter. i need the follow parts for a 74 standard drive transporter:

*tie rods
*heater boxes
*gas heater
*front window seal/back window seal
*cabinets/folding bed/sink/stove/other camping gear
*passenger side window handle

also if anyone can reccomend a good temp/tach/etc gauge set and a decent type
of cb that won't cost me a fortune i'd appreciate it.

thanks!

jonathan
