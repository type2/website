One of the basic differences between the York Compressors and the later
varieties are that the York was a &quot;piston&quot; type compressor that
definitely consumed critical horsepower needed.  This of course was amply
supplied by most of any of the &quot;Detroit Iron&quot; which even the smallest
straight 6 could provide.  But it was the only type available until the
late 70's on American Cars when the &quot;Radial&quot; type (some times called the
&quot;Vane&quot; type) of compressor was introduced, much more efficient and did
not consume as much HP.  Vane type compressors operate on a similar
approach like the FI fuel pump, except the A/C is driven by a belt.

I believe VW intro'd these vane compressors in 79 or 80 in their
watercooled line-up, but didn't reach the Vanagon until the Wasserboxer
was introduced in Jan  of 83.  I owned a Rabbit PU Diesel with one of
these.  Could hardly tell the difference in power when turned on and I
sure froze my butt off with one of these if I didn't watch it.

However, we all know that vane compressors didn't solve all of VW's
continuing A/C problems which most on the list (plus Lawdy knows others)
have had the displeasure to experience.  I'm picking up a very low
mileage/almost new 90 Fox Wagon (for local commuting round) this next
week that the original A/C is still functioning quite well, but I'm sure
it might be due for servicing.

I haven't reconnected the Rear A/C on my Westy yet.  I'd like to break-in
the engine first.  I've capped off the lines in the engine compartment to
prevent internal contamination until I decide whether or not I want to
replace the compressor (frozen) or just remove the whole contraption for
more room in the rear overhead.

&gt; have a 'disasterous' effect of the air-cooled engine ?
&gt; What are the short- and long-term effects ? &gt;&gt;

&gt;A/C in an aircooled bus/Van is almost sure death. 
&gt;I have never even been in a aircooled bus/van that had working a/c, as 
&gt;the
&gt;compressor belt has always been off. On the aircooled vans and buses 
&gt;since
&gt;'72, the aircond was always installed after-the-fact, at the dealer. 
&gt;There is
&gt;no such thing as &quot;factory aircond.&quot; in a aircooled bus or van. All the 
&gt;a/c
&gt;compressors on the aircooled buses and vans were usually made my York
&gt;compressors of York, Pa. The York compressors were the same ones that 
&gt;were
&gt;used on other American behemouths such as Ford Galaxies and such.  
&gt;They're
&gt;huge compressors, and put too much strain on the aircooled engine. 
&gt;VWOA must
&gt;have gotten a good deal with York to use their compressors without any 
&gt;regard
&gt;to lasting affects on the engines they were installed on. The majority 
&gt;of
&gt;aircooled buses and vans I see in junkyards with blown engines have 
&gt;the
&gt;dealer installed a/c units, and EVERY late bus I've seen in a junkyard 
&gt;with
&gt;an engine fire has had a/c....
&gt;
&gt;just something to think about...
