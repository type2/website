Subject: RE: pancake vs. up-right


&gt;S &gt;&gt;How would I spot a pancake motor vs. an upright motor if i was looking
&gt;S &gt;&gt;at the crank case broken down and the cylinders lying on
&gt;S &gt;&gt;a table next to it?
&gt;S &gt;
&gt;S &gt;
&gt;S &gt;I believe the fuel pump mount is different, and possibly generator
&gt;S &gt;mount too. Both mount on top for the upright-fan bug and pre-72 bus
&gt;
&gt;Oh, god yes. The fuel pump is mounted underneith and to the front of the
&gt;engine. It is supposed to be an engine-out job to change it. I managed
&gt;to change it by prying the hell out of the nearby tinwork....


Hey, guys, he's looking at a TORN-DOWN engine, meaning he's got
just a bare case. Cases were almost identical between type 1 and
type 3, despite the huge differences in stuff bolted TO the cases.

I think the only visible differences in the case themselves (please
somebody correct me if I'm wrong), is the area where the fuel pump
and/or generator stand would mount on a type-1. On a type one bare
case, both of these areas have holes for pushrods, oil breather, etc.
On a type 3 bare case, one or both of these areas is solid metal.

(Somebody on this thread also mentioned that the oil cooler mount
is different? The cooler is certainly in a very different place!

Many moons ago, I ran into a guy who said he built a type-3 pancake
engine aout of a type-1 bug crankcase, by fabricating a cover for
the open area on top of the case and bolting it in place.

End of guesswork. Now back to the news...
