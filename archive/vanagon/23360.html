Subject: re:  propane


I NEVER turn my propane off, except when refilling.

I'm still alive.

So far.

Q:  if I use my reefer on propane only, assuming that I'm not using
propane for anything else, and that I start with a full tank, and that
I have the reefer on the coldest setting, and assuming no particular
extreme weather temperatures, how long will the refrig go before
running out of propane?  A week, maybe?
