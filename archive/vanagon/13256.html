&gt;I think we started this thread once, but I can't remember the
&gt;concensus, due to my alzheimers-senility, or whatever that disease
&gt;was I had.  Anyway, how long should I warm up my car?

I usually wait until the flashing led on the temp gauge goes out, do 
up my seatbelt, and put her in gear... total time about 20 seconds or 
so.  As long as full oil pressure is ready first.   Wish I had a 
gauge for that, too :(

Once in gear, I drive under 2800 rpm and with light throttle until 
the needle is in the centre position.  This is usually the case in 
under 5 minutes.  I usually don't exceed 60 km/h in top gear during 
my warmup.  I am fortunate in that I don't have any road conditions 
that require lots of power (hills) or speed until after the engine is 
warm.

Hope this helps..

Harry.
