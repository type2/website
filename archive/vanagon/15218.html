&gt;so i put a new stereo in the beast yesterday.  home built kicker box,
&gt;nice amp, nice head, reasonable three ways.  sound good. sounds good.
&gt;sounds good!!!! [say that to yourself, it won't make any sense after a few
&gt;repititions...kinda like 'egg']  anyway i'm getting interference.  there's
&gt;a high wistle from the tweeters that follows engine rpm.  how do i make it
&gt;go away?

Radio Shack will be happy to seel you a 'radio interference filter kit'
in exchange for mere greenbacks.  When I installed an aftermarket amp in
my Taurus (blasphemy! a non-vw ride!) it whined with the engine.  The
radio shack choke silenced the racket.

(Of course, you COULD retrofit a diesel engine and do away with all that
high tension system that's causing you such grief regardless........)
