&lt;&lt; Anyhow, I said I'd look for an engine for them -- preferably NOT from an
'86.
  Maybe an '83 to rebuild, or one already rebuilt and guaranteed??? &gt;&gt;

'86 was the first year for the bigger and more desireable 2.1 liter engine.
  There's nothing wrong with &quot;86 engines&quot; or whatever.

What does it need, head gaskets?
