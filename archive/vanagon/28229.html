Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

&gt;I personally like the babes in bikini's. Yes, I'm a family man over 40,
&gt;but I'm not upset at having to look at scantily clad women on every other
&gt;page. Quite the contrary.
&gt;
&gt;I do however agree that the writing in these magazines are about 6th
&gt;grade level and could be improved, but pleeeze, don't take away the babes!
&gt;
        While I neither subscribe to nor read said mags, I too am forced to
agree that observing the female form is an enjoyable thing for me. I also
have no objection to scantily clad *males* for the *females* among us to
observe. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that many of the (young, insecure)
regular readers of said rags may have a homo-phobic reaction to same. And
as well, I'm afraid that like it or not, the automotively interested tend
more towards the male persuasion, making it unprofitable for the rags.
OTOH, I'm not a proponent of gals in my parts catalog. When I need parts, I
could care less how well endowed the girl in the picture is, and her salary
is raising my parts cost. No bueno.

        I speak merely from observation, seems that most of the ladies I
meet are rather uninterested in the intracacies of a CV joint. Perhaps Joel
can enlighten us on the ratio of male/female subscribers? I would be mildly
curious. Seems that most of the posts are males, but there may be a large #
of female lurkers out there soaking up knowedge. I actually wish that my SO
would show more interest in the bus, but it is not to be.

        Fire extinguisher handy...
(BTW, got to use my fire extinguisher Sun. AM. Big ol' Chevy Suburban was
burning when I got off the freeway, cop used up his exting. while I waited
at the light, so I jumped out and offered mine. Didn't do any good, it was
to far gone. Got to watch the tires explode. Which brings me to VW content:
If that Chevy'd been equipped with an extin. I'd still have 2 extin. (one
was at home) and he'd still have a truck. Something to think about when
your fuel line is above your distributor...)

Peace,
