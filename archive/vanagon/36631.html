Subject: Stuck in Vancouver

No, no, not that kind of stuck.  And besides I've never heard anyone complain 
about being stuck in Vancouver.

Got my list stickers today and promptly applied one to Lief.  Don't think 
I'll put one on the front (I don't really like stickers on the fron window). 
 But they look great!
