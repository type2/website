Sorry to disagree, but this is complete bullshit. Jerry made some of the
sweetest music I've ever heard and I'd be thrilled with a vanagon list with
his image on it being on my bus. 

I've listened the the Dead since 1969. I am not now, nor have I ever been
&quot;hooked&quot; on drugs. I believe there are lots of addicts on the streetrs that
have never even heard of the Grateful Dead. The Deadheads have been
responsible for resurrecting many a bus from an early grave, fixing them up
and driving them from one show to another. For the purposes of this group, I
think this is a beautiful thing. Isn't that what we're all about here? The
perpetuation of VW busses?
 
Just for the record.
