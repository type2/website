Subject: Re: Need Reciever Hitch 82 Diesel Westy For Hitch Haul Basket

Yo Mark,

Hey I caught your post on the hitch hauler/ receiver hitch request.
I just got it done.  But in case somebody is interested I'll tell the story.

  I wanted to install a receiver hitch and Hitch Hauler for my 91 Carat BUT
the 5&quot; receiver portion is to long to hide completely beneath the bumper's
dripline, water that is, otherwise the install is ok.

I had the hitch builder EXTEND the bumper mounting flanges 2&quot; and shorten
the reciever to 4 1/4&quot;. This means that the bumper now is 2&quot; further from
the van, and that the entire hitch will &quot;hide&quot; sans the receiver, behind
the fiberglass bumper cover.  That last point is a good reason to install a
hitch alone.

 The fiberglass bumper cover on the rear is a cosmetic device.  The factory
isn't required to install a crash beam on the rear of trucks. So the
vanagon has no rear crash beam, but a a cosmetic doodad bumper cover. I
just had a list member photo the setup, so it can be posted on the net.

&gt;Volks,
&gt;I saw that someone on the list was fabbing up some nice reciever hitches
&gt;that connect to the frame for our Vanagons. I am in need of one
&gt;w/hopefully a 2&quot; reciever (1&amp;1/4&quot; will work). I will install a Hitch
&gt;Haul basket carrier on this unit for extra gear on the Diesel Westy.
&gt;Also, anyone done this?
