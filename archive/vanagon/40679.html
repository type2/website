&gt;Help!
&gt;
&gt;Anybody own a 95 Eurovan Camper?  Opinions?
&gt;

&gt;

I have a 95, I think its great. Not perfect by any means, but an good
compromise between drivable and livable! I don't have a lot of mileage on
it yet though.

Watch the price, they're selling for at 15-20% less than retail.
And if you buy one, check every system out carefully before you leave the
lot, as there have been a few reports of things like dead camper batteries
and non-functional furnaces.
Also, if possible, consider where the Winnebago parts would be serviced.
Some VW dealers will not service those parts so you have to find a Winnie
place that can work on it. No rocket-science here, and you can get a
service manual for it yourself to &quot;help&quot; them out.

If you want more info, let me know via email.
