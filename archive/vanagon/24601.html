THE PLACE to call is:  Pacific Parts and instruments, North Hollywood.  
818/761-5139.  I have referred VW owners to these people before (back when I 
managed the Hobby Garage at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) and they came through, 
with a $2.00 part for ....$2.00.  No shitty &quot;since I had to buy $65 dollars 
worth of nylon, you are going to make my payment for one gear&quot;attitude, last 
time I checked.  If they jack you around, e-mail me and I'll see what I can 
do....

They also carry H-4 refelctors and bulbs, wholesale, about $24 each.  Lotsa 
cool VDO, Cibie, Hella, etc. stuff.
