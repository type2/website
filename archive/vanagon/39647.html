Subject: Friday--A cool VW ad...

..Maybe I don't get enough sleep, but I have what I think is a cool TV 
ad for a Vanagon (or would've been, anyway).

Shot of a busy highway. Lots 'o cars driving it. Cut to a Vanagon on the 
highway. The Vanagon people are happy (of course). They're coming up the 
highway approaching heavy traffic. Cut to various shots of people in 
other cars who are hot, tired, unhappy, etc.
Cut back to the van driver. He just shifts into 4rth and cruises on, 
seemingly right into the traffic jam. But then we cut to an outside 
aerial view. The van is now on its own road (that essentially just 
appeared), branching off away from the jam-packed highway off into the 
sunset (or sunny skies anyway). Just cruisin' along.

Tag line appears: Volkswagen Vanagon: the car so cool, it comes with its 
own road.




So I obviously have way too much time on my hands, right?
