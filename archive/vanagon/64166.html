     Curtain Cleaner Update
     
     VW treats Vanagon curtains with a fire retardant, at least in the 
     Westys. So they recommend dry cleaning the curtains to preserve the 
     fire resistance
     
     At least that's what the manual says.

My girlfriend and experienced garment and quilt maker recommends 
limiting curtain washing to a long soak with a mild soap such as woolite 
or quit soap. Use very little action of the washer's agitator - a full 
normal cycle probably is not necessary. This helps preserve the fabric, 
which is usually quite old.
     
She can make new curtains for anyone who needs them, if interested.
