Subject: Re: Air leaks in ventilation system

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Regardless of where I set the levers on the fresh-air and heat controls, air
&gt;&gt; continues to come through the vents in my '85 Vanagon.  Anyone else have
&gt;&gt; this problem? Will I have to go through what Gerry is going through with his
&gt;&gt; malfunctioning heater (i.e. dash removal, separating heater housings, etc.)?
&gt;
&gt;This may be a silly question, but which vents does the air come from.
&gt;You do know that the dash vents are not regulated by the fresh-air and
&gt;heat controls, but rather are opened and closed via a lever beside each
&gt;vent.  When I close everything off I get very little air flow, just a
&gt;nice whistle.

Thanks Jerry--the dashboard vents close nicely, it's just the other stuff
that leaks when it's supposed to be shut off.  The only thing that concerns
me is this summer when I (hopefully) have the AC working again, it might be
nice to shut off most of the outside air.  Right now, it just pours in
through the floor and defrost vents.
