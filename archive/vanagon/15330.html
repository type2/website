&gt; If these do exist for the 68-71 (or later) breadloaves, I'd sure like 
&gt; them.  Nothing like driving on a slushy day and getting delayed responses 
&gt; from both clutch and accelerator pedals--scary!!  Plus, I imagine some 
&gt; reduction in engine/road noise...

Certainly the post 71's all have a pan underneath the front center
section, stamped steel goes between the two frame rails and covers
the brake pedal and accelerator pedal assembly but not the clutch
which is internal to the left frame rail anyway on late buses.  Now
actually I have never yet looked under the front end of my Westy which
I have only owned for a month but I figure it has one, if not certainly
the later breadloaf one should fit the frame rails did not change.  If
you dont have one but there are 4 or 5 holes in the frame rails and rear
member boxing in the front rails certainly you did, I had one off a '73
parts bus I trashed recently as it was pretty banged up and rusty but
still solid, they got a couple of drain holes which sometimes dont drain
if the get bent up.  I note my Westy does of course have the added
reinforcement boxing the frame rails to the rockers back under the
center section like mentioned about splits, all breadloaf Westys,
sunroofs, or double sliding door models are so reinforced, which is why
converting a regular Bus to a Westy is largely inadviseable.
