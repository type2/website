&gt;&gt;components etc.

&gt;&gt;motor are 
&gt;&gt;available.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Tim, where are you shipping from? Also, what happened!!???!!!???
&gt;
&gt;Uh, on first thought, I think I bid for everything. On second thought, here
&gt;are some specific bids for specific items. I'd probably bid for more, but I
&gt;cannot think right now, so let me know if you develop a list with prices.
&gt;
&gt;$150 each for front and rear bumper (not including air dam)
&gt;$20 glovebox
&gt;$110 instrument pod (tach/speedo) with switches ($75 without switches)
&gt;$20 each for vent window glass
&gt;$23 mudflap
&gt;$100 rearfacing seat and base (foldup kind, grey)
&gt;$120 for curtains (hard to name a price until I know if you have the full
&gt;westfalia set. I'd pay $120 for a full Westfalia set, including rear screen,
&gt;skylight cover piece, and front.)
&gt;$75 brain
&gt;$25 tail light idle stabalizer brain
&gt;$25 idle stabalizer valve
&gt;$50 distributor
&gt;$70 muffler
&gt;
&gt;Derek Drew

&gt;DerekDrew_at_aol_dot_com (if interport is down)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The doors are meant to be sold complete $400 pr. I may have one vent 
window( I'm) not sure which side. The motor will not be parted, but I have a 
muffler and cat from a 1.9 (the cat is pretty 
shot) foor $125. Rear jump seats $150 each. Curtains : no windshield 
curtain. $180 for all curtains and rear screen. Someone is interested in all 
bumpers and ground effects for $800. Instrument 
pod is available.
