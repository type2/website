Subject: Re: Parts Place

OK. Here is my $0.02.

I think that there is one great thing about the Parts Place and that every
list member with a Vanagon and the optional rug floor mats under the drivers
and passenger feet should call them up today and order...

...drumroll...

...their rubber floor mats! These cost only about $30 plus shipping; they
are made for Vanagon. You store these underneath your regular fabric floor
mats and then when the weather is bad or your shoes are muddy you reverse
the order so that the rubber mats go on top and you avoid soiling the rug. 

These mats even have the words &quot;VANAGON&quot; emblazened across them.

&gt;&gt;  Does anyone out there have the phone number for &quot;The Parts Place&quot;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  I also would like to know what experience you all have with them..

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;I have their old number handy, (313) 373-2300  but the area code changed
&gt;if you call this one they will probably give you the new area code but
&gt;your out $.40 or whatever for the call, you could call info but probably
&gt;the same price, they are in Opdyke or Auburn Hills, MI.
