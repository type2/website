&gt; OK, this has undoubtedly been thrashed to death, but I searched the
&gt; archives and could not find what I was looking for, which is:
&gt; 
&gt; What is 'normal' oil temperature for my '71?  I thought I might have
&gt; heard something like 180F, but when I drove my Bus up from Phoenix,
&gt; my recently installed gage showed a max of around 230F!  The sender
&gt; is located under the engine, where one of the plugs for the oil
&gt; bypass valve is located.

My book says that optimal oil temperature is around 180F, with 230
deemed acceptable and 270 not unheard of on race engines.  I have seen
mine hit 250 when going up hills in the desert in 100+ degree heat.
Now that I have the flaps removed, oil temp only goes over 200 on rare
occasions.
