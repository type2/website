Subject: Re: Archive advice needed.

&gt;Can someone tell me how to access the archives?  I'm pretty much lost in this
&gt;area.

I have been using Turbogopher on the Macintosh.  I log onto the site:
halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu

My gopher window shows me 2 folders, when I open the Miscellaneous folder
you see the Vanagon one next.  I have been using the find function inside
the Turbogopher application to search for topics.  A search comes up empty
when I try to do a search through Netscape, but I expect that this is
because of the difficulty that Gerry reported in an earlier post last
evening.
