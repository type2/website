&gt;At very low speeds, it sounds like grinding or scraping.  At higher rpms, it
&gt;goes from a thunk-thunk noise to a growl.  I hear it at all speeds except the
&gt;very fastest.  It is most pronounced when the engine is accelerating.  The
&gt;green light is out at all speeds, although I do not have a pressure gauge.

i asked my brother about this and he suggests that it might be a bad crank
bearing. he said they had run into this once with a badly marked bearing ...
it was marked as oversized (which was needed), but was actually standard.

but check the other stuff (pulley on sheet metal, etc.) first ... anything
to avoid splitting the case again. and if you have to split the case, be
sure to check everything one step at a time (yeah, yeah, i know ... i'm just
repeating what my brother said) as you build up. they had to rebuild the
guys engine for him.
