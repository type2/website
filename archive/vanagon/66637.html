Subject:      Rekeying door locks

I finally got around to taking off the passenger door handle and inspecting
the lock mechanism to see why it was stuck.  Well not only is the mechanism
completely jammed but the tabs that actually do the work had been snapped off
while under the care of the PO.  I'd like to get a new handle and/or lock
mechanism (can they be had separately) but would like to maintain the same key
as on the drivers side.  What is the procedure to have the lock mechanism
match?  Is this a dealer service item?  Can a locksmith do it?  I didn't
receive the tags from the PO which give the serial number of the original
locksets; just the keys.  Is this enough?

There is a similar issue on the sliding door lock which the PO had replaced
with a new handle.  However, this handle has its own key so I would like to get
its lock mechanism rekeyed as well or match the original lock set.

So what I have is driver's door and tailgate matching the original key;
passenger side broken; sliding door new.  What I want to get to is all locks
matching and functioning.  Hopefully not a tall order.

Any help would be most appreciated.  Thanks.

Cheers,
- pavneet
