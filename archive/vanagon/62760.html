Subject: Re: Insulation for a vanagon ...

Just to stress this, tinting is a very good idea.  Also, our GL is 
white, including white roof.  This really helps, along with a 
cardboard window shade.  The van is bearable inside even after 
sitting in the sun all day.  

The black Talon, on the other hand, is an oven under the same
conditions, esp. with dark interior.  Sun shade is a must if you want 
to touch the steering wheel and shifter.
