Keep it simple.

I like the idea of riding around with a prune label on my bumper, but
someone with a new/restored Box may not...

The ascii graphic sounds good, but if we were to start to make it somehow
&quot;politically correct&quot; by including graphics of all Box types, then it gets
complicated.  Remember that it has to be something easily recognizable from
a modest distance, and at a glance - you might someday whiz past a Box
stuck in the breakdown lane at 65 mph.
