Subject: ?'s with My new 85 Westy Weekender Wolfsburg

     Can anyone help me with the following queries?
     ~What does Wolfburg offer me?
     ~Will my automatic last? (99,000 miles)
     ~My temp goes from before the light to the middle of the light, is 
     that normal?
     ~When I start it sometimes it takes a second for anything to happen, 
     normal?
     ~The front seems to sit very high, is this normal bus suspension?
     
     Thanks,
     James 
     San Diego
