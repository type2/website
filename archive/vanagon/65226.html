Subject:      Fuel Gauge

      Well, I have now replaced all the parts that I know of in the Fuel
Gauge system on my 83.5 in an attempt to not take the thing to the
dealer and his &quot;VAG&quot; tester. The gauge is still flakey, and van runs out
of gas before gauge reads empty. No dent in tank. I have replaced
sending unit, gauge and voltage regulator/stabilizer. Any further
suggestions?
