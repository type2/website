Subject: wtd: vanagon aircooled

well, i got to thinking (kinda dangerous) and decided to troll on the
list.
i have a 1980 vanagon, the motor is very solid but it needs work
elsewhere, i was wondering if anyone had a Manual Transmission vanagon
with a dead/missing engine, rust free, interior or not, sunroof would be
nice, that they would let go cheap. Basically i am looking for something
that i could throw my motor and seats in and drive, more or less. if i get
no responses ill rebuild mine and pray that the AT leak isnt too expen$ive
to fix.

take care,

steve
