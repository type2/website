&gt; This does not just affect syncros, but all later vanagons with
&gt; digifant fuel injection. The VW recommended correction is a $100
&gt; wiring harness. 

I've also got some instructions for the $.50 version of this fix if
anyone is interested (requires capacitor, soldering iron and
heatshrink.)
