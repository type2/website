&gt; We used to take our VWs to &quot;Beyond Repair&quot; in Paceco, CA for service.  Bill 
&gt; Watterson ran it and was wonderful.  If he said something needed fixing, it 
&gt; always did.  We could trust him not to rip us off with unneeded repairs -- he 
&gt; could trust us to keep coming back. 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, we've moved to Palo Alto, Ca and Pacheco is too far to go.  Can anyone 
&gt; recommend a VW mechanic on the Peninsula we can trust?  I like doing my own 
&gt; work, but sometimes life is too short; I'd rather go on a picnic with my kids 

I highly recommend Fred's Garage:

416 D St. / Industrial Way
Redwood City

(415) 368-5343

VW/Audi only, run by a German Family. Very honest, fair prices, and they use 
only good quality parts (Mann, Bosch, Teves, etc.) They're out of the way for 
me, but I still go there for major repairs.

I like wrenching too, but you can't do everything....
