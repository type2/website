Subject: Vanagon Diesel Fuel Mileage

Well with all the discussion of vanagon gas mileage out there, I 
thought I'd add a few more numbers to the mythical, 
mathematical averages for cruzin down the road.  These numbers  
are for my 1.6 L Diesel Westy (aka Havoc) with a 5 speed, fully 
loaded with me and the dog and a ton of gear for a half year road 
trip. 

Average around town was 27 mpg
Average on highway at 65 mph (+/- top speed) was 28 mpg 
Average on gravel roads like the Dempster Hwy was about 33 
mpg

Best mileage of my last trip was 35 mpg over Wolf Creek Pass, in 
Colorado, driving so slow, I thought I was going to roll backwards 
down the hill ;-)
