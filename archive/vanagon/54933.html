Subject: AZ vw mechanics???

I'm in a bit of a panic/bind;  my son is at college in Arizona, &amp; called
this PM to tell me he's hearing sounds 'coming from the engine-sounds like
marbles in a tin can' ('92 VW Golf-8valve engine).  He's 1k miles from the
in-house mechanic (moi), so I'm no help...anyone have a recommendation for a
reputable mechanic in the Prescott area (~ 1/2 way between Phoenix and
Flagstaff) ? ? ?
