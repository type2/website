Subject: Re Splitty rubbers

Sounds like some kinky sex channel for a minute here....sorry..Jim I too have
to replace all the rubbers and seals on our '67. been putting it off for ages
now it is the time to do it or forget it....
NOS are occasionally available but SSVC has almost used all we have been able
to source (still got a few front screen ones tho'). I have checked out this
over the past 6 months and everyone has their own views! All I can say is I
have gone for WCM through one of our dealers over here who also is running a
special discount (and imports in bulk so gets them cheaper than I could by
dealing direct anyway). I reckon they give me the best deal for /price and
quality...but then again you pays yer money and takes yer choice. I know lots
of people who put in cheaper seals that simply did not last.
