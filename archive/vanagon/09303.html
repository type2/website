I would say 650 is a decent price if and only if the body is in good to
very good shape (meaning no structural rust). The engine may have
&quot;seized&quot; but the outcome may be ultimately better than that (meaning you
might be able to take major components from that - ie engine core, flywheel
etc or even rebuild the engine if you are so inclined). There are always
other items
of concern of course - primarily brakes and suspension but these are more
easily repaired by DIYselfers.

Consider the camper components a bonus at that price if they are
functional and in good shape.

An engine which you install yourself can be had (sans flywheel) for less
than 1200 so all told I would expect that you are investing a minimum of
2000 dollars to get this baby on the road. Your biggest expense will be
either your time or someone elses. So if you have a some time on your
hands consider the following progressions: a) rebuild from the ground up;
b) purchase a short block; c) purchase a long block d) have someone
install the engine for you...

we paid 1200 for an 82 westy and put the engine in ourselves;  we
know exactly what went in, how to repair it if it breaks and still came up
spending less than buying one with a high mileage engine - good luck
