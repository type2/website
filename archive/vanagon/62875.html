Subject: Re: 97 EV Norcold Fridge Problems

For all you folks out there who have this problem,...In Europe, the VW
California Camper uses a compressor type chest refridg in order to get away
from all the absorption fridge's problems. Having had the Dometic fridge in
my `82 Westy for so many years and always having to be level all the time
when parked, I'd say it was a good move on Westfalia's part to make the
switch in the EV. Keep Cool ya'all,

&gt;I bought a new 97 EV camper from the dealer here in Boulder CO on March 28.
&gt;Turns out that, though we are a mile high in elevation in our town, the
&gt;van did not have the Norcold high altitude conversion kit to run the
&gt;refrigerator properly-or even to light it-at altitudes over 4,000 feet.
&gt;The high altitude kit, by the way, requires a second vent from the
&gt;refrigerator to the outside of the van: directly beneath the vent to the
&gt;outside from the top of the refrigerator.  The new vent will be placed at
&gt;floor level.
&gt;
&gt;The local Winnebago service center has the high altitude kit on order from
&gt;Norcold.  When it had not arrived at the service center for several weeks,
&gt;I called Norcold and was told that the kit is back ordered from _their_
&gt;(Norcold's) supplier.  The Winnebago service center also said that MANY
&gt;purchasers of new EV's are in the same position.
&gt;
&gt;Like other purchasers of the 1997 EV, I have this $34,000 vehicle sitting
&gt;on our driveway.  When we do go on trips with it, we must tote an ice box
&gt;along with us because we cannot even get the fridge to light.  And forget
&gt;about trying to get the DC current to cool anything.  That just does not
&gt;work.  Besides, it will draw down the battery, until the propane alarm goes
&gt;off, in less than eight hours!
&gt;
&gt;I would like to hear from others who have had a similar experience.  At the
&gt;very least, this is a breach of warranty:  bad practice on the part of
&gt;Winnebago and Norcold to ship new units that have this problem.  At worst,
&gt;and to the extent that this was done knowingly, it is a fraud on
&gt;purchasers.  We gave good value for the vehicle.  It should function for
&gt;the intended purpose.
&gt;
&gt;I understand that this problem also afflicted the 96's.  If you have had
&gt;fridge problems, I would like to hear from you.  Perhaps together there is
&gt;something we can do to have Winnebago make this right for its customers.
