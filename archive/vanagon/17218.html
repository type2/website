Subject: Re: CB Antennas and stuff
From: jcunning_at_snow.win_dot_net (John H. Cunningham)

I use a gutter mounted antenna that folds down. For a ground plane
I taped wire to the bottem of the luggage depression on the roof.
It seems ok, but I would like to hear what others have done to
improve reception.
 
&gt;
&gt;We were thinking of hooking up the old CB on our next trip out with the 
&gt;'85 Westy.  Does anyone have any ideas for antenna mounting/locations.  
&gt;Magneticare out because of the fiberglass top.  Has anyone done any side 
&gt;or bumper mounts, if so how did it work out, and where did you run the 
&gt;wires.  Also, any good radio mounting ideas?  Thanks!
&gt;
