&gt; &gt;  ...                           The MXL reinforced are $63 each and are your
&gt; &gt;best bet on the Vanagon since Conti discontinued their Vanagon tire. Shipping
&gt; &gt;for 4 is $27.24-total is $279.24
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oz, alias Robert at the Tire Rack 1.800.428.8355x307
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the ones who know what I'm talking about, all point me at the
&gt; Michelin XZX reinforced (185R14) as the replacement for the MXL.  Does
&gt; anyone know the difference between the two?  The best price on XZX that
&gt; I've found is 83.95$ per tire (includes mounted, balanced, new valves, and
&gt; disposal of old tire).  This is basically the same as the MXL price.

I just called Tire Rack and they said they still had the Conti's for
$80+ each, I said what else.  The XZX reinforced were about $65 each,
various Bridgestones and the Yoko Y356 8 plies were all about $60 each.
I found the Yokes local mounted and balanced for $75 each so that will
probably be my solution.  Incidently our '86 Vanagon came stock with
the reinforced XZX's not MXL's, they lasted over 50,000 miles and were
wonderfull tires IMHO.
