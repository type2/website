Subject: Re: North VA Pizza Gathering!!


Chris,

I have no excuse for not attending, really.  I was in town, but out to lunch
(or more likely not back from breakfast) on the pizza gathering.  Read about
it, checked the calendar, and then....?

Glad everyone had a good time.  Keep me posted as to future events.  Perhaps 
we should maintain direct communication for those of us in the Balto/Wash
metroplex.  VANAGON generates so much traffic, I sometimes delete things that
I should read.  I will submit a posting &quot;Subj: BELTWAY BUSSES,&quot; and all of
us MD/DC/VA volks can respond and collect our personal e-addresses.

P.S.  This doesn't mean I want to be responsible ;)
