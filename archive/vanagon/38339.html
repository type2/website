&gt;I know this has been answered before, but I have been tearing my

&gt;with the body of the letter &quot;subscribe vintag vw&quot;, then I tried
&gt;&quot;subscribe&quot;, &quot;subscribe vintag&quot;, &quot;subscribe vintage vw&quot;, and every
&gt;other variation I could think of.

&gt;I ended up subscribing to a vintage clothing list.  Now I can tell
&gt;you where to find vintage clothing in Washington DC, but I'm
&gt;_still_ not on the vintage VW list!

Ron, you tried just about every possibility except:

subscribe vintagvw

which should do it!  :)
