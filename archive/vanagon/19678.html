Subject: July 4th?


Any list members interested in a get together on the 4th of July?  Want
to se spectacular pyromania?  I'm going to be playing at the Concord
Pavillion with the Calif. Symph., featuring I think (dunno fer sure
until I git to the rehearsal) pop tunes, and as the finale, the 1812
Overature, complete (if my memory serves me correctly from past years)
REAL canons, and a roof top and side wing display of amazing
pyrotechnicity.  Anyway, it's kind of fun to bring a picnic
dinner and have it on the sloping green grass - concert under
the stars, etc.  

A couple of list members, including David Schwarze from san Diego,
have indicated a possible interest in attending.  I'm not sure
I'll be able to pull this off, but I'm going to see if there are
any comp. tix available.  If not, I don't think the lawn seating
is very expensive.  

Please let me know ASAP if this is of interest to you:  that's
the evening on the 4th of July, Tuesday.
