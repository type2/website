Speaking of aerondynamics, I saw a school bus on Sunday with a microbus welded 
on top.  I don't know if this is the one that has recently been discussed on 
the list.  It was an old green and white school bus with a white VW welded on 
top (not sure what year it was since it seemed to be some sort of custom job 
and didn't have tail lights or turn signals.

I spotted it in FairHaven (just ouside of Bellingham, WA).
