Al Sez:

&gt;Y'all mention that 6000RPM might be a little scary.  Only for a wasserboxer.
&gt;The carrera II will sing merrily at 6000 all day.  MSDS has the range panzer
&gt;kit which trades your ultra reliable water heat for no heater at all but
&gt;230+bhp.  He'll do the conversion for you for ~$10,000US includes the motor.
&gt;or ~$4,000 you supply the motor.  Or the kit of parts ~1,500 and you do the
&gt;work, buy the extra porsche parts and rx7 parts and of course supply a pukka
&gt;carrera II motor.
&gt;
&gt;You run larger tires on 15&quot; wheels to gear up for the 117mph top speed.
&gt;
&gt;The claim is it'll out climb (syncro of course) any box stock UJMT or stock
&gt;US 4wd bronco, k5, powerwagon, etc.
&gt;
&gt;But no heat.
&gt;
&gt;The reliability of the carrera II is very good, much better than the poor
&gt;overstressed 2.0l waterslosher.
&gt;
&gt;But no heat.
&gt;...

How hard would it be to build some sort of heat exchanger from the
Porsche's oil cooler/exhaust manifolds to the reminants of the
Wasserboxer's cooling system?

Seems like a tractable problem, no?
