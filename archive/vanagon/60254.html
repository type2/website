Camping World (800) 626-5944 has awnings for the VW made by A &amp; E Systems,
a division of good old Dometic!   Almost every large RV place will be able
to order them too.  They have a special bracket for the Vanagon &amp; Westy
which stands the roller up of the roof at an angle.  This also makes it
tall enough.  I've been toying with the idea of getting one but I am
monetarilly challanged at the moment.  Let me know how you like it if you
get one.
