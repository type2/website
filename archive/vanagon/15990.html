&gt; 	New motors are available depending on the year and voltage.  '67
&gt; was a one year only, and the 12V 66's are also hard to find.


Wow, '66 12V motors? Whooda thunk? I tried to stick a '67 wiper motor in my '65 
(since I converted to 12V) and remember not being able to make it fit for some 
good reason.

Do the 12V '66 motors bolt on to the 6V wiper assembly, or does the whole 
assembly (motor and arms) bolt in?
