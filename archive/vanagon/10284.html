Subject: Gas Gauge on 78 bus

My gas gauge is out on my 78' bus. 2 liter engine, 7 passenger. I know
the gauge in the dash is fine, and I was told it was probably the float
in the tank. I was also told the only way to get to the float was to
remove the engine, transmission, gas tank, etc.. I was wondering if it
was possible to nibble out a hole from the rear floor/riser behind the
rear seat to get access to the float, replace/fix it, then seal the hole
back up with tiger hair. Any thoughts? The main info I'd need is where
to cut the hole, plus any other ideas...

Thanks.
