Subject: Why replace? Re: Front Suspension Squeek


If they are squeaking, is there any degraded performance or risk of damage 
to other components?  Or is the squeaking just an annoying part of wear?

|Suspension squeks up front usually caused by Upper control arm bushings.
| These are available aftermarket and the bentley manual gives good
|instructions on instalation.  You need to tack weld them on non Syncros to
|secure them to the arm.  Note that the eccentric washers are actually shims
|and come in three sizes.  If there is a gap when putting the arm back in, 
you
|will nedd to get thicker shims.  Do not force arm back in place or use the
|mounting bolt to pull the arm together.  This will cause the new bushings 
to
|fail again.  I found the many vans are not shimmed correctly to begin with 
so
|order shims before taking van apart.
|Dennis.
