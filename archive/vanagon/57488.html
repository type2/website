&gt; We're looking at an 86 GL with 141k miles at a used car dealer's lot.
&gt; I'm going to go back Saturday to drive it and take it to my mechanic on
&gt; Monday. It was owned by the proverbial little old lady that goes to his
&gt; church and service records are unknown. My question is this, is it
&gt; possible that this has gone 141k miles with no head work being done?
&gt; &gt;From following the list, my feeling is that this would be very unlikely.
&gt; There were no obvious coolant leaks and overflow tank in back was full.
&gt; For $2200 it's looking like it might be a good deal.

Yes it is possible and yes if it looks good and sounds good it probbaly
is a good deal at $2200.
