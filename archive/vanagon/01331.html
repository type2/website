This brought something to mind, actually.   Last year we had the
compression done at VW for 'The Beast' and we were told that the
cylinders all checked in at 140psi (it is psi, right?).  Up to 
that point the only thing I'd read was Muir's book and he seemed
to think that 130 was pretty normal (if memmory serves).  Now,
being paranoid, is there anything that could cause excessive 
compression?  Should I be worried at the 140 reading?
