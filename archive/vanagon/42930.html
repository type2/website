&gt;The regulator has leaked a
&gt;little for as long as I've had it. Now the shutoff valve leaks so the tank
&gt;emptied out it a couple of weeks.  From browsing the archives, I've gleaned
&gt;that the regulator is no longer available.

Originally, 80 to about 83 Westies had a Two Stage Regulator that was Round
(in fact it was also used on the 74-79 Westies as well).  Starting in 84, the
Regulator changed to a square style due to Federal Regulations dealing with
Motorhome-type gas appliances becoming more stringent to promote safety.
 Either is interchangeable, but I strongly recommend upgrading to the Square
Style Regulator as it is a much improved unit.  I have maybe one or two Round
Regulators left in stock (price is $67.00)(and yes, it is no longer in
production because of current regulations deeming it to be unsafe as a
replacement,) and of course I stock the Square Regulator as well (price is
$86.80).  No modifications need to be made, the fittings mate right up.
 Alas, the Shutoff Valve for this same tank was never available separately
and only works with this style of tank.  Again starting in 84, the Tank was
improved with a newer style Shutoff Valve (that is also available separately,
but will not work on 80-83 tanks).  The only option in this case is to
upgrade the tank to the 84-Early 89 Style and it is not cheap (price is
$577.50 and includes the newer valves, but not the regulator assembly)(Last I
heard VAG was getting over $650 for this tank).  It is safer tho, to refill
this tank due to the Autostop Valve installed in this newer setup.  Do not
call Manchester for this tank, as they ceased production over 3 years ago (I
called them late last year).  Although not in stock, I can get a tank within
48 hours or you might try the boneyard.  Good luck, Vanagon Westies are very
very hard to find in those places :(  Someone out there have a good one to
sell? Let Mike know :)

What is the small hole on the dash to right of the Steering Column?  It's the
famous &quot;Silver Socket&quot;.  It is Westfalia's idea for a power socket utilizing
various 12V accessories with a unique plug.  Trim Shop in Arizona
(602-955-7791) has the &quot;mate&quot; to it as well as several accessories I believe.
 For further info, check the archives (FAQ) on the socket.
