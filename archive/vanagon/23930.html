     (snip)
     &gt;&gt;i just replaced my pilot bearing last weekend.  on p. 13.7  in the
     &gt;&gt;bentley manual there is a diagram which shows a felt ring and spacer
     &gt;&gt;which did not encounter in the pilot bearing r/r.

     The felt ring and spacer should cost you about $3.00 at the dealer.
     The felt ring acts as a sort of seal, keeping the grease in the
     bearing, and the clutch dust out of it. I have done several clutches
     on T-4 engines, and the felt is either always missing or a measly,
     torn scrap...
