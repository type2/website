Subject: need xerox of '93 EV brochure



I'm looking for someone who'd be willing to xerox their copy of the
VW '93 Eurovan brochure for me.  I'm considering looking for a used
EV, and want to be informed about which options and accessories were
available for it.  I tried to get this from VW of A, but they unfortunately
were not able to provide me with a copy.  

At any rate, if anyone has this and is willing to snail mail it to me,
I'm of course happy to reimburse your costs.  Many thanks in
advance...
