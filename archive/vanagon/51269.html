Subject: Bad starting

Hi,

My Westy 85 begins to be mysterious:

After cleaning and changing the ground strap, the battery connectors,
and the battery at last my strating problem continue.

It has begin this summer, I turn the ignition key and nothing except
the fuel pump humming. There is only a click in the starter that can
be heard from behind (I mean by someone near the starter). After a
boosting the engine starts everytime.

This fall, after a oil changing and a ground strap cleaning/replacing
the problem goes worse. It is like there is a condenser to charge
before the strarter goes (the problem seems to go worse each colder
day). The battery is new since saturday, but the problem continue.

Is someone have an idea to were I should search. The alternator is
suppose to give 12.5 volts (this summer after a test after another
bad starting).

Thanks
