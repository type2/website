&gt; Now I'm agonizing over an oil cooler... the bus developed a minor

&gt; I've ever owned... what gives?  Cold weather?), I found silvery
&gt; metal flakesdown in the bottom of the oil strainer, so if I recall,
&gt; list-wisdom is that a new one is in order.  Well, the prices are steep:
&gt; $154 from Hoy Fox :( Can get a rebuilt one for $40, but how do
&gt; I know it doesn't have metal flakes in it?

You don't.  All you can do is trust the rebuilder.

As for the metallic flakes, I noticed that the anodized coating was
peeling off of the insides of my pushrod tubes as I was installing them.  
Maybe this is what you are seeing?
