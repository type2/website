Subject: RE: Braided stainless steel over &lt;?&gt; hoses

On May 22, Bill Abbot asked:

&gt; Has anyone in this group had a rubber or braided stainless
&gt;brake hose or oil line fail? The early type IV FI engines had a LOT
&gt;of engine fires because of fuel line problems, anyone here have one?

I have had both, but the brake line was probably the original unit on a '66
Buick Special in 1975 on hard braking, going downhill with a load - thank
goodness for emergency brakes and that there was no cross traffic at that red
light I ran as a result.  My '75 Westy self-destructed because I was always
going to replace the fuel lines next week, but they failed this week.  It was
dis-heartening, but it got me back into a Splittie.

The more common problem I have had with brake lines is that they clog and need
to be replaced long before the rubber degrades to the point of rupture.
