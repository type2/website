Subject: part for 82 westy sink

I was testing my sink on the Westy this morning.  After opening the drain 
under the van, and filling the tank a little, I was excited to see the 
water come &quot;pouring&quot; forth from the faucet!  I was so excited that I 
didnt notice the H2O was NOT draining out from under the Van.  Opening 
the cabinet door revealed the drain hose off.  Unfortunately, the hose 
wasn't simply disconnected, instead it had broken off.
The piece I need is a small plastic dome, attatched to the drain by 4 
thumb screws, to which the drAin hose mounts.  There is no part # on it.
Does anyone have any ideas on where to locate a replacement?
Thanks for any input.
