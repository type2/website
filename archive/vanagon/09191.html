Well,

Reservations are still available.  Carol and I nabbed one this morning, so
we will be there with Tonto the dog.

Does anyone know if there is much open sky access at the campsite?  I am
debating bringing my telescope, but it is a little cumbersome, and as I
recall it is pretty heavily wooded at Pfeiffer.  Besides the forecast looks
like rain ;{ through Saturday.

Martha, What time do you think the dinner will be?  We will bring some after
dinner libations, as you suggested, and will probably bring an appetizer as
well.  Hopefully we can get there early enough for that.  Also, can you
remind me of the logistics?  Is the first person there going to try to round
up a group of nearby campsites and reserve them?



&gt;
&gt;Here are the listed hikes for the area:
&gt;
&gt;Pfeiffer Falls Trail, Valley View Trail, Oak Grove Trail, Gorge Trail,
&gt;Nature Trail, Buzzards Roost Trail, Pfeiffer Beach
&gt;
&gt;Since they are not very long I will probably go on all of them that I
&gt;can, including going out at night and very early morning. 

Sounds interesting.
Bring your raingear.

John
