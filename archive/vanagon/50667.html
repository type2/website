&gt; I guess I'm just lucky - or are '88s different? My speakers came out

Yeah, just pop off the door panels.  To do this you must remove the window
crank hnadle (remove plastic cover and unscrew) and remove door handle
(remove plastic cover &lt;behind moving handle part&gt; and unscrew srew)  Pop
off the door panel and you can then access the back of the speaker. 
Unwind (unscrew?) the plastic holder on thingy nad unplug speaker. 
Tah-dah.  Reverse to reinstall.
