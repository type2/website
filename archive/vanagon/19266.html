Subject: Advice on hitches please

I know hitches were covered a couple weeks ago but I'd like some opinions
on pulling a 16' motor boat. The tongue weight of about 35-40 lbs and I'd
guess maybe 800 lbs gross weight?????

So will my '77 1.9 ltr with new top end handle it, I guess I'm mosconcerned about the clutch. It's only 1 mi. to the ramp and I don't plan on long trips]
with the boat. My other option is a 91 Ford Escort wagon, 1.9 also.

Does anyone have advice, comment, suggestion?? 

TIA,
Scott
