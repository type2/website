&gt; It looks like the third weekend of January may be preferable for
&gt; many of you, rather than the first weekend. Or maybe even the
&gt; 4th weekend would work as well. Comments/votes?

No fair!! :-( I say we weight votes with the number of miles it takes
one to get there! Roughly 1,800 miles here in favor of the first weekend
in January :-p

&gt; Sami - I guess maybe we could do a pizza thing agian during that first
&gt; weekend, when you are out here visiting?

That would be nice :) I'm still open for that or something else along
those lines. But let's leave the date open for now if you don't mind.

Thanks,

Sami
