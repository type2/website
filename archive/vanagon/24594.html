Subject: Spark plug insert for 1600 air-cooled


I pulled out number 4 plug on my '71 bus, and found one of those #$_at_&amp;!!
spark plug inserts on it. Meaning, the insert was no longer in the head
where it belonged.

This is not a Helicoil. It is a little metal sleeve, about 1/2&quot; diameter
and 3/8&quot; long. Plug-size threads on the inside, slightly bigger threads
on the outside, for which the head has been tapped, probably after some
ten-thumb lawnmower hack stripped it out by torquing it like the old
Ford out back.

NAPA has new inserts, and I have new plugs. Does anyone know how to
keep those little beggars IN PLACE, so I don't have to go thru this
every tune-up? Further, does anyone have experience with these things,
who knows whether losing an insert weakens or trashes your head?

Plug Number 3 was OK, strangely enough. But No. 2 requires both hands
on the end of the 3/8&quot; rachet handle, to get it to turn. Anyone have any
idea why? Any info is VERY MUCH appreciated, before I kick this engine
all the way into the Pacific Ocean.

Geez, I hate these &quot;rebuilt&quot; heads...

Sorry for the dump. But this engine takes the prize when it comes to
silly-a**ed problems that never should have occurred. Wonder when the
case will crack?
