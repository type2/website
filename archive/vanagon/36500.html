Subject: Re: Pulsing when lugging engine....


&gt;&gt;I am having trouble (potential) with Vroomhilde, the '71 Bus.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;When I am lugging the engine, in 3rd or 4th, but even a little
&gt;&gt;in 2nd, I get a pulsing sensation, at about the engine speed.
&gt;&gt;It is not a sound that can be heard, but really only felt.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I dont notice any sounds that sound like the tranny, so I
&gt;&gt;do suspect the engine. It is terrible in 4th, unless I
&gt;&gt;am coasting downhill.
&gt;
&gt;Engine sound that is felt more than heard,  Need to check main bearings.
&gt; Case is probably shot.  Rod noises are obvious. Mains or worn case give 
the
&gt;sensation you describe.


And where does this expensive and destructive wear come from?
Why, from LUGGING THE ENGINE, of course!
So knock it off already! 25-year-old classic VWs have enough
problems, without getting beaten to death on top of it!  :^)
