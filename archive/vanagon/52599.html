Subject: Re: Propex installation questions

Before giving this one a shot, I want to point out that
my installation is on a 1990 Syncro Westfalia, and the
Propex group buy will be installed in Splitties and Breadloafs as well,
so my exact procedures will not hold for all. As long
as the listmeisters do not strike us dumb, I'd encourage other
Propex installers share their experiences.

Anyway, Pat asked:

&gt;1. I think I know which is the combustion inlet and exhaust, but &gt;which is which re. the fresh air inlet and outlets? 

The hot air outlet is the one with the taper (that makes it
easy to slide the hose on, but difficult to clamp to).

&gt;2. When running the silver hose from the combustion inlet/outlet &gt;to the side of the bus, do you use the silver hose on both, or &gt;just the exhaust (not hooking anything to the inlet)?

Ideally, you want to get the exhaust about 18&quot; away from the intake. The
vent &quot;hat&quot; is for the end of the exhaust. I attached mine to a flange on
the inside part of a jack point, then ran
the hose to it. Then I used the remainder of the hose to
run the intake well forward of the exhaust. Make sure the
intake is not pointed to the front of the bus, you don't want
to get water in there...


&gt;3. What about that black control box with the two sided tape? Can &gt;I just stick it to the furnace itself, or would that be too hot?

I don't know yet if it would be very  hot :-(. Probably not, though. I
would just it lay loose until you have it up and operating, and then
decide for yourself.

Good luck,

Tom F.
