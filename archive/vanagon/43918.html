Subject: Bus towing bus connection

Just a quick question.  I'm thinking about towing my Westy with my Bluebird bus, but 
don't want to risk a weak connection, nor leave cosmetic defects on the Westy's front.  
This should store away in a Bird storage locker by some non-fixed connections in the tow 
bar allowing some collapse or easy disassembly.  What have others done?
  This should give the best combination of class towing class.
       John
