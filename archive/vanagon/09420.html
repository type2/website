&gt; 
&gt; What is the latest estimate for number of people attending?
&gt; 
&gt; Inquiring minds want to know.
&gt; 
&gt; 

  We are presently waiting to see what the weather is going to do, since some
  of us will have to sleep in a tent. Earliest departure for us would be 5:00
  pm from Palo Alto and we'll probably take 101 to the cut-off for Monterey
  that is a little north of Salinas. BTW, Francesca and all three kids are
  planning to go
