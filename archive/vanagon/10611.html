Subject: VW-88 VANAGON GL-SLIDING DOOR OPENS (AT THE WRONG TIME)



&gt;......  Whenever it is cold (ski area cold) or really wet, and he is
&gt;using the auto door lock, his rear sliding door can suddenly come open
&gt;while driving.  While this can have a positive effect on increasing air
&gt;circulation, it can be a bit unnerving to the average rear passenger.......


Nick,

I had a similiar problem with my 1987 Syncro. The door would suddenly open, well
not totally, 
whenever the temps got cold.  I didn't want to screw with adjusting the door
itself, so first
I throughly lubricated the inside of the door latch located on the left end of
the sliding door, opened and closed the door several times, and the problem was
cured.  I guess the latch was sticking inside during the cold weather and would
not close completly.  If that doesn't work he may need to re-adjust the door
itself.    

Good luck

P.S. My van is not equipped with those auto door lock gizmos,


Mike
