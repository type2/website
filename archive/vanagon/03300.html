Yes: we had the same problem and fixed it right after  we bought the
van about four months ago. There is the cheap short term solution and
the long term one which involves repalcing the rubber. JCJoel's has it
for about $80 I think, but you probably also want to replace the front
rubber as well and I don't know if that is included. Here's  what we
did for the cheap solution.

1. Although the rubber degrades it is really the metal clamping that
rusts out and loses it holding power, thus you will need to find an
effective substitute. I have found that windshield cement works well IF
you are careful in applying it because it is semi-permanent and black.

2. Remove the entire strip of rubber, this is easily done by lifting
the top up about 1/3 of the way. That way you can get the front
portion off via the tent zipper opening. The back portion comes off
easiest when standing about half of an inch off the roof. Make sure you
remember where your start and end  points are otherwise you will find it 
difficult to &quot;round&quot; the rear corners. After pulling it off, clean out
all the rusted stuff thoroughly using a screwdriver or a sharp pointy
stick (not a banana). This must be thorough because the rusty stuff
will not hold and will in fact mnake the job less effective (it also looks
lousy when it leaves drip marks down the side of the van). Use a hose
or forceful spray o water to clean it out.


3. I found it easiest to  reapply the trim in sections or sides. Apply
the cement and use plenty of clamps spaced about 1-2 feet apart. If
you have lost all of your clamping power in the strip you will need to
make more clamps. I ran short and was using everything from vice grips
to battery cable clips. The cement dries quickly so act fast and
diligently. You will also need to reapply in areas that didn't take.
if your roof is white as is mine you would want to be careful about
where you put the stuff. Don't apply to much in one area because it is
semi-permanent. Later, when all is dried, you can check out the
integrity of the hold and fill in any gaps....

I have dones this more than few times on the rear window of my KG
Convert which has the glass window and drains to the inside of the
car...believe me you want a solid seal....

4. Looking out through the tent opening is also a good time to remove
the front portion. (I was amazed what was under there -leaves, branches
of trees, very small rocks, etc etc). It comes with four or five
covered nuts accesible through the tent and a couple of sideand front screws. It
is easier to reapply the rubber on the front portion with it off. If
you live in a rainy area as I do it is worth fixing/replacing because the rubber
does an excellent job of protecting the paint and body underneath. The
difference between exposed and unexposed paint is amazing....

5. All told the job should take only a couple of hours...
Good luck
