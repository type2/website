Yes, Michael we have.  But by the time get one strong enough to
run:

Steve's electric porta-potti
television
vcr
blender
oven
heaters
air-conditioners
battery chargers
shower pumps
venturi jets on the solar spa
etc.,

we then decided that we'd need a generator to run the generator.  So
far, no one has volunteered to tow this for us.  Would YOU like to?  :)
