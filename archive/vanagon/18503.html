Subject:       Re: WANTED: Rear window for `59 23-window!

&gt; Please be more specific regarding your 23 window request. Do you need the
&gt; corner glass, the rear hatch with glass, or just the rear hatch glass only?

Speaking of this, I am on the look for a rear window for a '57 
Double-cab.

It is similar to the small glass on the pre-'63 Kombi's, but is 
slightly bevelled.  Looks like this:

Anyone in cyberland have any connections on this strange piece of 
glass?
