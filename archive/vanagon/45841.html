Thanks to all of you for pointing me in the right direction for posting 
to this list.

Here's my question:  About two years ago I sold off my VW collection 
('70 bus, '73 Squareback, '71 Beetle, but I kept my '67 bug 
convertible), in a brief period of flirtation with Hondas.  It was a 
rather torrid affair, but has now ended.

I have since been going through rather severe withdrawal and am 
therefore in the market for a Vanagon.  I'm looking for something 
early-80's, came across an '85 last night for $1700.

The vanagon has 144,000 miles, automatic trans., a slight oil leak, and 
has trouble starting when hot.

The engine is original/never rebuilt, and the owner suspects that the 
oil leak is from a bad head gasket.  He has no idea why the engine won't 
start the engine gets hot - it just turns over but never fires up.  

I'm not too hot about owning an automatic, and I'm interested in hearing 
from a VW owner with experience in driving one.

I've never owned a water-cooled VW and have in fact always been somewhat 
suspicious of them.  Will an '85 Vanagon be about the worst purchase I 
could make for a first experience with water-cooled engines?  Should I 
keep looking for something with 4 or 5 speed?
  
Finally, any ideas on the difficulty of replacing the head gasket and 
the mystery no-hot-starts will be appreciated.

Thanks!

Justin (Betcha never knew what God's first name was!)
