Tim &amp; List,

  I posted &quot;Rebuilt&quot; racks to the list a while back.  The racks I posted are ZF
Rebuilt racks.  ZF is the company that does the OE racks&amp; PS Pumps for VW.  They built
the original racks and are now doing the &quot;Rebuilding&quot; too.

  I'm familiar with the &quot;Seal Kit&quot;, not much to that kit and you're right Tim, No
bushings come in that kit.  Just a bunch of o-rings and seals.  The bushing wears out
and causes the problems in the rack so the kit is &quot;Worthless&quot; with out the bushing and
the tooling to install it.

  I had alot of people ask me why I wanted so much money for the ZF rack(450.00 plus
core).  The reason is that these are probably the best &quot;Rebulit&quot; steering rack on the
market right now.

  I want to thank Tim for being so imforamtive on his prior dealings with these rack
problems.  The sharing of his expense too is helpful for other people to see if
they're getting what they paid for or getting ripped off.

  I bought 20 of the ZF racks.  I know that I wouldn't put any other companies rack in
my van so why would I sell another companies rack?  I base all my buying and selling
of parts on this principle, Not good enough for me, not good enough to sell.

  Kyle
