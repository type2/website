Subject: Re: Snap-On Catalog

&gt;I was scared at first but later found that
&gt;many of their tools are not that much more than Craftsman.

how much is &quot;not that much more&quot;? i have found snap on tools to be of
excellent quality but can't justify their outrageous prices, and that their
lifetime guarntee, requires chasing around the fellow in the step van.
Unless snap-on has finally come to their sense as far as pricing goes, i
think i'll stick with craftsman. that is my $0.02 worth.
