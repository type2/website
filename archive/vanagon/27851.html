Subject: RE: WTB: clock for breadloaf


&gt;  Does anyone have the clock that fits in the right hand &quot;hole&quot; in the
&gt;  dash on a breadloaf &lt;mine is a '74, but they should all be the same,
&gt;  right?&gt; that they would be willing to sell?
&gt;
&gt;  I thought about putting a tach there, but I've decided that a clock
&gt;  would provide more useful information - besides, the engine gives an
&gt;  AUDIBLE report on it's activity on a continuous basis.


I put a JC WhipMe &quot;Sidewinder&quot; tach in that hole on my '69 bus
in COlorado. It fit, and Never had a problem after.
