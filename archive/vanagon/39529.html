Yup, this is what my 1974 Sun Bug had on it.  I couldn't find a muffler 
for it so I just put on a standard 1600 intake so that I could get the 
heat risers to match a normal exhaust.  My Sun Bug began its life out in 
Nevada someplace so I am assuming that explains why it had this funky 2 
holes flange on it - some kind of emissions crap I pesume!
