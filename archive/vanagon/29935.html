Subject: RE: cars of the year

     Yes it was the Renault built by AMC in Wisconsin, 1983, I think.
     They sold a bunch of them here in DC, and after a coupla years,
     they were off the roads, and I don't mean at the Range Rover Test
     Area.

     While the advertiser/editorial content conflicts exist, remember
     that the car of the year thing is typically a beauty contest among
     new vehicle designes introduced that particular year. The year
     following some major introductions, there may not be many new models
     to evaluate. Thats what happened when the turkey Caprice was Car of
     the Year: there wasn't anything else really new!

     The Best of the New is not necessarily better than whats already
     available on the market. Its mostly a way to sell magazines, I think.

     Conversation in the Editor's office &quot; Lets see, one month Domestic Car
     of the Year, next month Foreign Car of the Year, then Sport-Ute of the
     Year, plus the New Car preview issue...We only need to get creative
     for eight issues!&quot;
