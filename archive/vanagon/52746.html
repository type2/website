Subject: Cooling Problems

(Just want to mention it snowed about 3&quot;&quot; here in the mountains near Valley 
Forge, PA and my studded snows performed excellent!)

My problem is (and has been with my 83.5 w/c Westy) when I'm driving around 
town, the temp gauge moves between right before the left of the LED to a bit 
past the right.  It usually starts to move to the right when I'm idling but 
does it sometimes when driving.  When I'm on the highway, the gauge is right 
where it belongs the whole time, right to the left of the LED.  What's 
happening is there is NO HEAT after the gauge passes over the LED, which is 
quite often on my slow mountain ride to work every morning.  If I go to bleed 
it, only a small bit of air comes out then it's coolant.  I have not added 
coolant in 4 months as it is not leaking.  It never overeats and the radiator 
fan works fine and the radiator gets hot all over. The water pump and 
thermostat were both replaced with the new engine in August.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Bryan

(hmmmm, all this talk of Propex heaters....)
