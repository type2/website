&gt; &gt;Bullet indicators finished in '62 but 612483 would definatly
&gt; &gt;make this bus a '60.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I have proved nothing, since Steve said the number could also be
&gt; read as 672483, which would be a '61 according to the NEATO list.
&gt; 
&gt; My source for the change over date from bullets was 
&gt; http://killer-whale.automatrix_dot_com:80/~skip/volkswagen/early-diffs.html

I thought I saw a '62 23-Window with the big oval turn signals...  
Maybe a '63?

'62 end of bullets?
'63 end of 23-window?

Clara has the magic book with all the dates for the chassis numbers...
