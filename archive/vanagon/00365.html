&gt; Or, for that matter the first VW home page.  I'm setting up a web server
&gt; but it is still in it's infancy so it probably wouldn't be the best place

&gt; web server.

Actually, I do have all the facilites to do that -- web and gopher (gopher's
easier right now because I have easy access and there are text tools to 
manage it), but when I think about archiving it, what comes to mind
is the time it's going to take to organize it.  Are you interested in 
writing a home page?  And tying it to all the files?  I think I wouldn't 
put them on the listserver.  I hate the way it gives out files and I'm 
not running the interactive part.  When I put the messages out in a 
searchable fashion, I'll probably put them on gopher.  I will also put 
them up for ftp first.  The tech sheets are a good example of something 
that would fit in well with ftp and gopher as will the archives of the 
list at the end of the month (compressed).
Of course, if we had a Web home page, we'd have to come up with some 
pictures of Vanagons, Transporters, Eurovans etc as well as some audios 
of the distinctive sound of the VW horizontally opposed 4 cylinder engine 
and the pinging of the valve rods against the rocker arms.  Anyone 
managed to capture that yet? &lt;smile&gt; (not to mention the sound of the horn!)
