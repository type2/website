I use 80/100s 9004

They have melted the connectors that connect the wiring harness to the bulbs.

Also, my ignntion switch went bad and perhaps it was because of the
excessive current as per advice from Dennnis Haynes.

So I plan to install a relay and replace the plastic connectors on the end
of the wiring harness and see how it goes from there.

Yes, they are brighter, but the low beams still seem pitiful compared the
the bright highs.
