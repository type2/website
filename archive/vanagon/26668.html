&gt; OK, I can't top either of these, but...

&gt; I load the equipment and personnel of a 4-piece rock'n roll band in my '84. 
&gt;  Everything easily fits in, and we ride in VW style and comfort. 

i load the sound system in the van for a coffee house (60's style 
ambiance with a kick-ass sound system) we run here in the 
northwoods, even with all the Westy stuff in place and a rear facing 
seat ta boot!  people always comment on how 'neat' it is inside there 
and are amazed at the room as we keep pulling out amps, mains, mike stands, gig 
bags etc.

today at the grocery store the following exchange took place with the 
carryout boy (and he WAS young).

carryout: &quot;Wow. That's a cool interior.  Is that like, a fridge in 
there?&quot;

me: &quot;yup.  and a stove and a sink and two beds.&quot;

carryout: &quot;Funky&quot;

ya just gotta smile
