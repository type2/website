Subject: Vanagon diesels

Hi Justin,
   Was reading your post questions about diesels and thought I might add my
$0.02 worth.
   First, yes, Vanagon diesels are just like a rabbit diesel, most of the
parts are interchangeable.  They came with a 1.6L and were offer from
'81-'83. In 83 you could get a vanagon with an air-cooled motor, diesel or
the new water-cooled flat-4 1.9L engine. Yes, they are slow, the engine
only produces 48hp. The trans is geared much like a split window bus.  But
they get great fuel mileage, average about 30mpg. Most parts are still
available, and are not to expensive.
    When I bought my Westy diesel the engine was shot. The bearings had
worn out do to antifreeze in the oil and lack of oil pressure.  I had the
choice of either rebuilding the diesel, with new crank and rods to match,
or replaced the diesel with a used gas rabbit motor.  I went with the gas
motor. It was cheaper, and at the time I didn't have a lot of time to do a
complete overhaul. Besides, I heard that it could be done and I'm a sucker
for trying new things. So far the motor has been great. Right now I having
problems with the fuel injection. But baring that I think that the gas
motor has been a good choice. Anyway, the diesel, is a good motor, maybe
slow but it's reliablity and relatively cheap to maintain makes it a good
choice in my opinon.  If you do decide to get a diesel vanagon you could
always do a gas transplant. In line-4 water cooled motors are quite
plentiful in the salvage yards. I hope this answers your questions.  Good
luck finding one.
