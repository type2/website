 1982 Bus (Vanagon), 2.0l air-cooled, 4 speed, 125k miles:
 When you bring up the clutch the whole vehicle shudders. This happens 1st
 and reverse, but also in 2nd. In fact it is easier to reproduce it in 2nd.
 When there are enough revs and take up is slow its OK but when you are
 trying for a quick getaway in 1st or 2nd its more noticeable.
 
 How do you diagnose whether its a bad clutch or just what happens normally
 because of the engine mountings? &gt;&gt;


Could be bad clutch or pilot bearing.  If repalcing clutch, have flywheel
machined also.
