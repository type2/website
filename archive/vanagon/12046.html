Subject: Re: Adjusting Valves

&gt;
&gt;I hate to ask this, but how do I do this on a 2.0L?
&gt;We have just been rolling the bus until we think they
&gt;are pretty close to TDC, and doing the feeler gauge thing.
&gt;
Jack up a rear wheel, put the bus in 4th. gear and turn the tire to turn the 
engine. I usually have all the plugs out when I do this, makes it easier. 
You can lie still under the beast and rotate the wheel, saves 
moving/walking, gawd I'm lazy. Your 2.0l has hydraulic lifters no?, if so, 
what you set is really an initial best position, the lifters will handle the 
'adjustment' automatically. tim s.
