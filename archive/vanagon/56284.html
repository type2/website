&gt;&gt;        In-class Assignment for Wednesday
 &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story.  The
 &gt;&gt;process is simple.  Each person will pair off with the person sitting to
 &gt;&gt;his
&gt;&gt;or her immediate right.  One of you will then write the first paragraph
of 
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;short story.  The partner will read the first paragraph and then add 
&gt;&gt;another paragraph to the story.  The first person will then add a third
 &gt;&gt;paragraph, and so on back and forth.  Remember to reread what has
&gt;&gt;been written each time in order to keep the story coherent.  The story is

&gt;&gt;over when both agree a conclusion has been reached.
&gt;&gt;   ----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted.  The 
&gt;&gt;camomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now 
&gt;&gt;reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he 
&gt;&gt;liked camomile. But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind
off 
&gt;&gt;Carl.  His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him 
&gt;&gt;too much her asthma started acting up again.  So camomile was out of
&gt;&gt;the question.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron 
&gt;&gt;now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about than

&gt;&gt;the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom
&gt;&gt;he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago.  &quot;A.S. Harris to 
&gt;&gt;Geostation 17,&quot; he said into his transgalactic communicator. &quot;Polar orbit
 &gt;&gt;established.  No sign of resistance so far...&quot; But before he could sign
off
 &gt;&gt;a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through

&gt;&gt;his ship's cargo bay.  The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out
of 
&gt;&gt;his
&gt;&gt;seat and across the cockpit.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt 
&gt;&gt;one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who
 &gt;&gt;had ever had feelings for him.  Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its 
&gt;&gt;pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4. &quot;Congress
 &gt;&gt;Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel.&quot; Laurie read
&gt;&gt;in her newspaper one morning.  The news simultaneously excited her 
&gt;&gt;and bored her.  She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth -- 
&gt;&gt;when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree, with no 
&gt;&gt;newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of
 &gt;&gt;innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her.  &quot;Why must one
 &gt;&gt;lose one's innocence to become a woman?&quot; she pondered wistfully.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Little did she know, but she has less than 10 seconds to live. Thousands
 &gt;&gt;of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership launched the first of

&gt;&gt;its lithium fusion missiles.  The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed 
&gt;&gt;the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left 
&gt;&gt;Earth a defenseless target for the hostile alien empires who were
 &gt;&gt;determined to destroy the human race.  Within two hours after the
 &gt;&gt;passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth,
 &gt;&gt;carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet.  With no one
to 
&gt;&gt;stop them they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan.  The lithium
fusion 
&gt;&gt;missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded.  The President, in his 
&gt;&gt;top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the
&gt;&gt;coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion which 
&gt;&gt;vaporized Laurie and 85 million other Americans. The President slammed
&gt;&gt;his fist on the conference table.  &quot;We can't allow this!  I'm going to
veto 
&gt;&gt;that treaty!  Let's blow'em out of the sky!&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is absurd.  I refuse to continue this mockery of literature. My 
&gt;&gt;writing
&gt;&gt;partner is a violent, chauvinistic, semi-literate adolescent. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yeah?  Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts at 
&gt;&gt;writing are the literary equivalent of Valium.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You total shit.
