&gt;are these sealed beams halogen?

all 1986-1991 vanagons, the ones with the squared headlights, use a
replaceable halogen bulb ... i think it's a 9004 or something like that.
used to be hard to find, costs about $20 each.

so you don't really even have &quot;sealed&quot; beam headlights.

now, the 80-85 vanagons had the round headlights, and thus had the old
sealed beam headlights (required by u.s. law at the time).

but the 67-85 buses CAN retrofit the Cibie Z-Beams or Hella or Bosch halogen
replaceable bulb lights, for brighter and better night vision. it ain't cheap
and if you break a reflector, it's even less cheap ... but imho it's better
lighting.

however, running that extra ground wire directly from the battery to the
headlights, even if you keep the old sealed beam lights, can help.
