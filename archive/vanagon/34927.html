Anyone have any data, pictures, or whatever of large-animal-impact
resistance add-ons for a microbus?  I'm thinking that something like
that would go well with the safari windows on the Wombat ('58), as
well as playing with the minds of other motorists in the area.

Yes, it's Friday, and yes, this is silly, but I am actually moderately
serious about it.
