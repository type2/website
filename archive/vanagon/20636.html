Right on, a fellow low brass player.  My '71 bus has come in real handy  
in hauling my tuba(s) around for gigs--and for TubaChristmas in Denver 
it's nice to be able to fit (pack) seven big guys and horns.  My best 
friend, Joe, has a '70 bus and does the same.  Although I try to avoid 
campgrounds when at all possible, I have played in a town park or two 
with various groups.
