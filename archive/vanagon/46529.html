The Westy interiors I mentioned are available from Recycle Auto Parts,
4944 Pearl Street (or PO Box 4428), Boulder CO 80306.  Their number is
303-443-2887.  Interiors are shown as $300.  Pop-tops for '68 and
later are around $250.  They have one top for pre '68.  I may be
getting that one sometime soon.

In general, these guys are pretty knowledgeable, and have quite the
stock of parts.  They get vehicles that have been wrecked, and pull
all the useful bits off of them.  They don't have the shift rod
assembly I need, though :-(.
