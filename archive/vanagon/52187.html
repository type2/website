Subject: '66 Transporter Offer Suspended - Please Read

Holy cow, I set off a bomb here. As of now I have twelve people interested
in the Transporter and parts I advertised, and I have yet to notify the
seller that I've heard from anyone. Therefore, as of 3:00 AM Eastern Time
Sunday, November 24, I will no longer be accepting interest emails, and this
will last until I can get my dad's friend in touch with the dozen people
looking to buy this stuff. Sorry to disappoint anybody, but I'm the only
connection between this guy and cyberspace, and I don't want to overwhelm him.
