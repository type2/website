Subject: Burning Plastic.

Most people following the list who have some common sense have simply started
deleting all these messages, but for some reason there are a few who continue
posting about it even today!!!  
Please ... this is obviously an off topic discussion. Please do NOT discuss it
on the list any more.

Thanks.
