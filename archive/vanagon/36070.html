Subject: Cooling flaps

Following the strong urging of the list, I today installed the  vanagon
engine compartment seal  that I recently got from Busboys(complete with 10%
list discount). What a pain especially when the tin edges are boogered up
from prior engine work. I understand now why so many buses are missing their
seals. Anyway I feel much better now and hope that the 81 breathes better as
well.

Now the question. There has been a thread the past few days on the operation
of the air flaps and the thermostat etc. My uneducated observation while
working on the seal tells me that I have flaps but no thermostat and control
cable working those flaps. The spring is in place and under tension so I
assume that the flaps are being held in an  &quot;open&quot; position. Is that a
correct assumption and if so, now that we're into near spring weather is that
an ok situation ?

Thanks,

Weston
