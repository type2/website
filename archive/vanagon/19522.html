Subject: Re:a racial issue??????

&gt; Neil Wigley says,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I agree that the man's behavior was unconscionable, but, &gt;again, I don't
&gt; &gt;think race has anything to do with it. Nor should it be &gt;reported by the
&gt; &gt;narrator.
&gt; 
&gt; It made the story funnier and besides it's a common stereotype that black
&gt; guys like to drive those big cadillacs.  No one is trying to make a racial
&gt; issue out of it except for you.  Get a life!
&gt; 



	I agree.
