Sure, I considered it.  Then I realized that I was the administrator...
&lt;chuckle&gt;

&gt; to ask or answer questions with a group of people who won't say, &quot;jeez
&gt; Alistair, can't you think of anything else but your van?&quot;

Jeez Alistair, can't you sty on the topic of vans?
&lt;just thought might be refreshing&gt;  I too get that all the time -  &quot;you 
really like that van don't you?  That's all you ever talk about&quot;

&gt; Happy Hogemanay to you all!
Ok, enlighten the idiot.  What's Hogemanay.

No one even bothered to ask me what &quot;Nice Driveway&quot; was all about.
No one even laughed to indicate they got it.  
Not even off line.
I think I'll go balance my checkbook or something fun like that. &lt;groan&gt;
