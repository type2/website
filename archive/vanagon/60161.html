Hi Peter, I have had a similar problem with my instruments, if you &quot;follow&quot;
the wiring harness under the dash,  just to the right of the steering
column, there is a connector that is specifically for all of the
instruments. There is a multiple ribbon connection which pushes on to the
connector, you may find that this has become dislodged or loose as it did
in my case. You just need to push it back into place or fiddle with it a
little to make sure that it is sitting correctly.

&gt; Hello listees, 
&gt; Here is an &quot;anyone else out there had this&quot; question:
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed just the other day that my tach quits wotking and my eng. temp
&gt; gauge flashes when I turn on my lights. Using the dimmer dial for the
&gt; instr. lights I get half a tach reading and the temp gives another
&gt; result. Checked fuses, wires, connections, etc to a moderate extent, no
&gt; removal of anything but the dash cowling, and no results. The oddest
&gt; thing was when I removed the fuse for the instr. lights the tach worked
&gt; w/lights on and the temp gauge flashed to no end.
&gt; 
&gt; The film (plastic) holding the circuits for the panel seems to be OK,
&gt; just recently bought this rig and can recall it working fine previously.
&gt; 
&gt; I am also curious about the replacement of instrument light bulbs. They
&gt; are fixed in the white mount pretty securely.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there have a similar situation? Solution? Area to target?
&gt; 
&gt; Money to the list account from a quiet member, too.
