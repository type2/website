Subject: Re: Jetta/Golf/Cab mailing list?

&gt;Does anyone know if there is a mailing list or parts FS  list for
&gt;Jetta/Golf/Cabs???
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
&gt;chris

Yes, there is the VW H20 list.  Not nearly as busy as this list though, but
still helpful.

Send message to:

LISTSERV_at_SJSUVM1.SJSU.EDU

No Subject

In the body of the message:

SUBSCRIBE H2O-VW  your name


There is also the water-cooled VW newsgroup which is pretty active.

I hope this helps

James
