Subject: Re: cb range?


A always go by the &quot;seat of the pants&quot; figure - a watt per mile.  It's 
generally true as far as *REALIABLE* communications.  Everytime I say 
this, I get floods of stories from guys banging their fists on the table 
telling me about how they takled skip and all that jazz.  Being a Ham 
Radio operator, trust me, a watt per mile is the normal range.  In town, 
it may be reduced though due to buildings and such.  Do yourself a *BIG* 
favor and spend the $50 or so for a K40 antenna.  It recieves better, 
transmits better, etc.  Using an SWR meter, I tuned it at about 1.2:1 
across all 40 channels.  Even if you don't have the antenna adjusted 
right, I still got the absolute worst reading of 2.1:1

Hope I've been of some help...

Oh yes, with my K40, I generally get 6 to 8 miles reliably...

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Now that I've got my new cb toy, I was wondering what the useful working range
&gt; would be.  It's a 4-watt transmitter with a whip antenna, a bit more than 3 feet
&gt; long.  any ideas?  Oh, by the way, it's mounted on top of a bus :)
