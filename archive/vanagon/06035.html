I'm a violist.
I was a tubist in high school and loved it.
Mostly I play the button accordian, however. (German or Slovenian 
fingering, but no concertina).
Of course, I also play the guitar and piano enough to entertain my kids.
No wonder I don't have time to fix my van...
I've never done music for a living, and I've never (and will never) 
mechanic for a living.

And WHAT does this have to do with VWs, eh?  Did you know there are 
three Jerry's on this list with '84 vanagons -- two of them are the same 
color even!  23-skidoo!
