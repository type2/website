Subject:      Kombi? HA!

a little bit of light shines upon the meaning (or use) of the term: Kombi.

while browsing through a book about all the vw cars built from 1949-1982,
i ran across a description of the various models of the Passat sold in
north america (sold over here as a 'Dasher'). what caught my eye was the
description of '2-door and 4-door Kombi' ... which the pictures show as
what we would call simply a 'station wagon'.

now, the Passat Kombi doesn't look anything like the Type 2 Kombi, but
the bus was always sold over here as a 'station wagon', so i guess that's
what it generically means: station wagon.
