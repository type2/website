Subject: VW T-Shirts, last call

I hate to be a pest about these T-Shirts, but due to the amount of emails I
am receiving from various lists, I will have to unsubscribe for a while.  If
you are interested in this cool shirt, please email me directly at the
address below.  Thanks to all of you for the support you've given in keeping
my bus going!!!

I posted earlier that I had found some VW related nick-nacks.  Well, MANY of
you responded.  Instead of answering individually each of your emails, I'd
like to post the relevant information for getting one of these T-shirts.
Again, they have the VW logo in blue on the front (image is approx 12&quot; x
12&quot;).  It's a very nice Haines T-shirt and I wear mine all the time!  I am
assuming that an additional $2 should cover shipping just about anywhere in
the U.S.  So, if you are interested, here's the info:

MY MAILING ADDRESS:

Paul Smiley
P.O. Box 1308
Falls Church, VA  22041

INCLUDE:

1) Your name &amp; mailing address
2) Your size: Large, X-Large, XX-Large
3) Cash/check for $12 (XXL $14)
4) Email address or phone number (in case there's a shipping problem)

I check the P.O. Box every couple of days and will send it out as quickly as
I can via US Mail.  If you'd like to contact me directly, my email address
is psmiley_at_tmn_dot_com


Thanks and keep V-DUB'ing!!!
