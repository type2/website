Subject: Re: Sink cabinet for 71 Westy-how to find

&gt;I'm missing what I believe is a &quot;sink cabinet&quot; assembly for my 71 which is 
&gt;supposed to go right behind the fron passenger (U.S. :-)) seat - am I correct 
&gt;and does anyone have advice on how I'd go about finding one?  Anyone seen them 
&gt;anywhere, other than the obvious luck of stumbling onto one at a junkyard 
&gt;(which I've tried to do already).

Forget that thing, thats where the cooler goes!
