Subject: Re: 71 Part number help..

&gt;Hi there,
&gt;Well I was a lurker but now I'm not I guess. I have a question if 
&gt;anyone could help me. What is the part number for the break backing 
&gt;plates (rear) for a 71 Westy? What year busses will the part fit 
&gt;from?
&gt;I'm in Israel and I am going back to my bus (in Connecticut) in  a 
&gt;few weeks and I thought I might look for the backing plates over here 
&gt;(actually it wasn't my idea, thanks Joel)..
&gt;So if anyone can help me out.

Hi Jay,

All parts numbers listed below are from chassis #211 2000 001--up (starting
with 1971 model year).

Left Rear Brake Back Plate: 211 609 425 L 

Right Rear Brake Back Plate: 211 609 426 L  

Leaf spring adjust device, rear (holds star adjusters in place): 211 609 485 B
(This is probably included on a new back plate, but I mention it for those
looking only for this piece).

I called Mofoco and Rocky Mt and neither stock the back plates for buses.  I
haven't tried the dealer yet or NOS suppliers, but they might be findable
through these sources.  Recently a lister from the UK mentioned that he
bought some new backing plates for his 70 or 71, so they are available
somewhere.  If anyone finds a source/prices please post to the list.

Another 71 lurking in Connecticut, huh?!  I'm a white on red 71 poptop in
West Hartford.  Give me the secret vanagon_at_lenti wave if we pass.
