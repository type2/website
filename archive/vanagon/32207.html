Subject: Re: Running Boards on a Westie Syncro

&gt;1) Has anyone mounted running boards on a Westie before?

  Nope, have heard of step/board that fitted into FR/RR jackpoints. Old I
think, but I've never seen a pic. Liked the idea.  Do as sand tracks when
crossing the Kalahari or something.

&gt;2) What brand names should I look out for?

  HaHaHa What? You want one to fit!? 

&gt;3) Will it look stupid?  We still want to look good you know!!  ;-)

  Don't forget the little red and orange marker lights, fur sure eh!
