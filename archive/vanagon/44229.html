Subject: Re: 'blue dot' tail-light lenses

&gt;newbie question of the day... anyone know of a supplier of 'blue dot'
&gt;tail-light lenses? I've seen them on some of the vintage american classics,
&gt;but can't recall ever seeing any on an import. My OE lenses are chipped and
&gt;cracked, and I also need to replace the rear sidemarker lenses as well.
&gt;
&gt;thanks in advance,
&gt;

Charlie,
    JC Whitney sells Conversion glass lenses.  You have to drill a hole in
the existing tail light lens.  I hav'nt seen a source for complete taillight
lenses with the blue dot installed.  Many states blue dots are illegal.  
JC Whitney # 12DF3306U.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
