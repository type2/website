Hi, Matt.
 
 
	I am thinking that I have pretty much made up my mind
&gt;just to break down and get a GEX rebuild for my bus.  Does sound
&gt;like the way to go?
 
I forget what kind you have, or where you are. I haven't used GEX; I'm in WI
and did a rebuild with parts from MOFOCO in Milw. They were very helpful. They
also have rebuilds. I haven't heard bad things about GEX.
 
&gt; ...Also, would anybody either have the goofy little
&gt;blower things you need to make the gas heater work and the temp sensing
&gt;wiring harness?
 
What kind of heater do you have? I have some older Stewart Warner parts, and am
admittedly unfamiliar with them. I saw that in Hot VW (or the other one) there
was a short article on gas heaters and a guy that fixes them. Maybe someone has
more info. But if you have an older S-W, maybe I can help you. There is also a
shop named SIG's near Wisconsin Dells. I don't have his number on me, but it
should be in the archives with the subject VW guy in WI. He has a gas heater in
a '78.
 
&gt;Mr. Joel kindly forwarded a schematic for this some time
&gt;ago, but if I get this thing going again before winter, a heater would
&gt;be very, very good....
 
Do you have a copy of this? I can't find it on the archives. If you could
forward it, thanks!
