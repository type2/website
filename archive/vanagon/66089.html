 just replaced those goodyears with 205/65-15 p4000 pirelli's _at_ $65.00
each.  i know that they are not the same light truck rating but the
max inflation of 35 lbs gives just about the same load rating anyway.
i just put 2000 miles on them in 1 1/2 weeks at that inflation with no
ill effects.  the tires also ran cool to the touch at sustained 70 mph.

cheers
