Subject: Re:  Bus Art: paint ideas and designs?

&gt;how about like a greyhound bus?  an airliner of your favorite travel company?
&gt;shamu the whale on the side?  a big desert tortoise on the side? native
&gt;southwestern indian symbols on the side (it is a desert camper)?

Houston is headquarters to &quot;DOC&quot; (Doctors Ought to Care - &quot;...DOC is a
coalition of health professionals and other concerned individuals helping
to educate the public, especially young people, about the major preventable
causes of poor health and high medical costs. Our focus is the &quot;killer
habits&quot; with a particular emphasis on counteracting the promotion of
tobacco and alcohol...&quot;) They've painted their '71 to mimic the &quot;Marlboro&quot;
Adventure Team vans - red and white with giant lettering that says
&quot;Barfboro&quot; and in smaller letters &quot;barfing team&quot;.  [No flames please -
personal opinion aside, this is another paint scheme...]

Long ago I saw a white van (don't remember the make, probably not a VW)
with a Porsche 911 derivative painted on its side.
