Subject: Leaking auxiliary heater
Date: Mon, 4 Apr 94 15:04:13 EDT



In the process of removing the seats and carpet from my 84 Vanagon I
discovered that the auxiliary heater beneath the rear bench seat has
been slowly leaking antifreeze.  The two hoses appear to be in fine
shape as well as the heater core itself.  The leak appears to be coming 
from the little white threaded valve on the top left of the heater core
housing.  I removed the valve and it's gasket and cleaned them up.  This
has stopped the leak for now but I have yet to test it under pressure
with the engine running.  Is this a common problem?  Also, does the metal
lever next to the valve alter the flow of coolant?  If so which position
is open and which is closed?  If that is not it's function then what the 
hell does it do?

On a side note the carpet looks brand new.  The river of sludge that poured
out was quite disgusting along with all of the carpet shampoo residue from
years gone by that kept bubbling out.  A 1500 psi stream of water works 
wonders.
