Subject: Re: Box for luggage rack


I have a Rubbermaid box (2 clasps) that fits in the luggage rack w/room 
to spare.  $10. _at_ Home Depot.  These boxes come in many sizes, other 
companies make them also.  Send'em to a big hardware store.

&gt; I met some folks Saturday with a mint '85 Westy they bought new in Germany.
&gt; It has 160,000 miles on it but is in absolutely pristine condition. Wow!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, they are not on the list but we got to talking and they raised a
&gt; question I've been wondering about. Has anyone out there found a plastic
&gt; bin (with top) that fits smartly in the front luggage rack? They recently
&gt; bought a Rubbermaid they thought would do the trick but it was too long.
&gt; Like many of us, they have done the tarp and bungee cords/net routine, but
&gt; hope someone has a better solution. Any ideas out there?
