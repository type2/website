Regarding Steve M's story of the yellow convert.

I spotted a mint and white standard 13 window and an abandoned water pumper
Vanagon sitting next to a horse corral in Palm Desert a couple of years ago.
Both were in relatively great shape and complete. I also did a quickie
search to no avail. I wanted to hang out to wait for the feeding of the
horses in order to talk to the land owner etc. but time was of the
essecence. In other words, the wife was not up to baking in the sun for up
to 18 hours, we had no way to tow it home (on that trip), and that whacky
employer of mine probably wouldn't understand. The requisite note was left
in the mailbox. It was mysteriously missing the next trip through...
The hunt for the treasure is sometimes more fun than the restoration (if you
know what I mean).
