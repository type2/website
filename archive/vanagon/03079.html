Subject: totally bummed out, Rocky Mt. Mrt. Works
Well, along with others, I mentioned the &quot;15%&quot; sale at Rocky Mt. Motor Works.
I had contacted a guy named Rick who was real nice and sent a bus catalog on
so I could order. He told me to fax in my order attn. to him by Sunday night
and he would fill it first thing before they ran out of stock. Well the family
has been dying to try out the new camper and I've been busting my rear to get
ready for the parts, all needed to get are new beauty out on the road. We
needed around $400 bucks worth of parts but did manage to pull together a
little more than $200 for the order (not much to them maybe, a mint to us). If
you are al all like me by the time that order is ready you have every page of
the catalog memorized and compared every price with all the other mags and
catalogs you have collected, agony &amp; ecstasy. Finally the order was made,
Sunday night the sucker was faxed in. Monday I was already watching for the
UPS truck. They state 3 day delivery. Well my mistake, I should have called
first thing Monday. When I got the phone today they said they had never seen
my order. And Rick? Well he went on vacation this week. From my side it is
hard to believe the fax did not go through. I just feel lousy. Of course all
the parts I was trying to order are out, be a month before the restock.


Well they probably are good folks, there catalog is nice, but I feel bummed
and pissed. Id someone to be made at. Some of the stuff I needed isn't easy to
find elsewhere, and especially at 15% off. Oh well guess I'll just repack
those front wheel bearings this time rather than replace them. And maybe I
don't need a couple of those body seals just yet. Still, hate to by the engine
seal et. al. locally. If I can get it, man will they be prey. Guess I better
watch it the rest of the week, hope n the rest of you guys got better karma
going.

(By the way. What do you say is the minimum needed to pull the engine, replace
the trany, and not have to worry about leaks? Thanks)
