Subject: is it safe to heat w/ propane while driving?

I just snagged a coleman vented furnace from a wrecked popup trailer (the 
poor man's propex I guess).  I made a little metal template and a 
hanger for it and it slides nicely into the partly open window on either 
my 84 retro or 71 westy.  It works nicely while parked &amp; I was hoping to 
use it to heat the 71 for daily driving, but the guy at the welding place 
where i got the refillable 10# propane tank was really worried about the 
propane sloshing &amp; causing an explosion.  Does anyone have a take on 
this?  I have a regulator--the kind used for gas grills--&amp; like I said, 
everything is hunkey dorey when I'm not moving.  Is this guy paranoid or 
can I get something to fix this problem?  I never had any problem with 
&quot;sloshes&quot; while driving when I used a throw away canister on a Mr. Heater 
catalytic bolted to the floor of my old 73 bus, but I just don't feel 
like doing that anymore (something about being a daddy?)  Can anyone 
confirm/deny what I've heard so I can get some heat or forget about it?


Also, any suggestions on where to put a non-westy propane tank in a 
non-poptop bus?
Thanks

Chris
