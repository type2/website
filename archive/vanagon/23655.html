There's a local kid with a '67 bus that he's prolly gonna be selling in
the near future.

It had been stolen previously, and somewhat stripped.  I've helped him
get some of the parts, but he still needs some stuff,like a motor and
windshields.  He has a good steering box for it, just needs to be put in.
Bus has just a bit of damage in the pass/rear.  been fixed but needs to
be finished.  The rest of the bus is almost perfect and rust free.  The
nose has never been hit and is cherry!

Oh, and it needs and ignition switch, and a couple of other minor dohickeys
which I can't recall right now.

He has a 40hp for it that I gave him.  It ran, but kinda weak.

Its a camper with most of the camper stuff in it.  Sorry, no spice rack
thingy (RVB)

He's into it for about $600 or so.  His parents are making noises
like he should sell it 'cause they're tired of seeing it sit in front
of the house.
