Subject: Diesel Vanagon conversion project underway!

Well, I got the engine and tranny out of the van on Saturday.
All told, just over 4 hours to remove the engine/tranny assembly, and start
dismantling the exhaust system. I had to be careful with it, since I want to
reuse it later...plenty of WD-40 and the &quot;blue wrench&quot; (torch) got it apart.

I added some more photos of the project to my website as well. Be warned
though, I have not compressed the images! A few are approx 100k! Look at:

BTW, Does anyone know of a good shareware utility for
compressing/manipulating/formatting images?

Thanks!
