Subject: [FS] 86 Westy


While beginning a theraputic search for &quot;New Bug's&quot; replacement, I
went by our local VW dealer...nothing there interesting for me
other than a $20k Golf /// Cabriolet...I wonder if
I could get the laundry company to buy it, considering their driver
is now charged with driving to endanger?

Anyway...for you vanagon/westy wannabees...

'86 Westy camper, 99k miles, white, complete interior, screen on
poptop has a few holes, body looks straight, has A/C and 4 speed.

$7,995....but I think it could be had for less.

(508) 999-4573 - Dartmouth, MA
