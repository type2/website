Subject: carbon cannister baywindow busses

Folks, 
Has anyone replaced their charcoal cannister in their 72-79 bus?
Is there any need to replace this thing?
My bus has been smelling like gas lately, and before I drop the firewall
to get a look at the gas tank and tubes leading to it, I wanted
to know if my problem *could* be in the charcoal cannister.

So far, I've checked ALL fuel lines, and the filler neck, and the bus is 
not running too rich.

Any thoughts?
Paul
