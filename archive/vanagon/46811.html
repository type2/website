Well, this *is* a list for VW transporters, isn't it?  sorry, but I've
owned a '57 for twenty years, and it never was a good truck in any real
automotive sense.  Yeah, I'll probably get flamed, but I like the VW
despite the fact that they have problems cooling!  My old air-cooled
version *really* needed to be rested.  Often.  The water-cooled one is
much better.  I even run my A/C sometimes.

VW's were bad cars for many American drivers.  If you didn't adjust the
valves twice a day, and change the oil every 1200 miles (three times on
a cross-country trip?) they died short horrible deaths.  My '57 died
more horrible deaths, more times than I can remember.

They were cheap.  That's why people bought them in the first place.  Later
busses were not-so-cheap, and people's expectations seemed higher.  Well
I waited until they were cheap, and my expectations are based on driving
an even more flawed beast than a waterboxer for 20 years.

I think you need a sense of humor and realization that you drive a VW
just because you are a VW person.  An old Dodge van will be cheaper, and
probably have more luck with those who expect their van to actually reach
any particular destination.

We are driving up to Alaska in two weeks, perhaps we'll see them Inuvik folks,
but I *never* plan on being anywhere at any particular time, so I a
m not trying to meet their schedule.  Schedules, VW's and me don't get
along.  Last trip we spent several days visiting unscheduled repair shops
on an 8000 mile trip around the country.  It was fine, freed us from
commitments.

I guess I'll always be a VW person.  I'll probably not ever buy a new one, though.
