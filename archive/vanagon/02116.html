&gt; Seems a shame to have all those cubic feet moving across America just carrying

I'd be willing to draft a letter to VOA and VOC asking for sponsorship of 
this trip - we should consider shooting for the moon - and see what we 
come up with. Who knows they might cover some of the costs/ or provide 
accommodation at all the VW dealerships across this great continent or 
alternatively provide support (technical, moral, philosophical) along the 
way, especially if it is pitched as having some societal benefit (any 
ideas?).  Given that VW sales are in somewhat of a decline (flat in 
Canada) they might be very enthusiastic in their support to increase 
their profile.... then again...

At any rate lets hear from anyone interested in co-editing a letter - all 
ideas are welcome.
