Jim Davis asked about the above mentioned vehicle.

I saw one at the show in San Antonio 2 weeks ago, and I have to say I
was rather impressed with it. Some would say they weren't impressed, but
I was. Of course this one was probably the loaded one, with leather
seats, and plush carpeting.  I only wish that they put a larger engine
in it. It had the 5 cyl gas engine, though the owners towed(yech) their
Thing to the show, and won the Thing class. How could you not with a car
that never sees the road except from atop a trailer?

Cheers,

David
