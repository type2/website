Ok, so I finally put seatbelts in the bus!

I got a pair a Bug O Rama for $20.  Went and bought some grade 8 bolts
nuts and washers and set to work.  I think the grade 8's were overkill,
cause they are a lot stronger than the sheet metal they are going thru,
but oh-well...

My first mistake, which I didn't realise 'till later, was locating the
inner mounting bolt.  I forgot where it was s'posed to go (I had none to
start with) so I guessed.  The belts don't feel right.  I put the bold on
the horizontal shelf next to the spare tire.  I'm gonna re-locate it to
the inside front of the spare tire well.  And I've got a 1/2&quot; hole to
patch up now!

Uh, that was my only mistake :)

Also, the non-latch part of the belt really isn't long enuf, so it doesn't
reach to the middle of my lap, but is about 6&quot; off to the side.  I think
I'll end up buying another set, but at least I have something for now...
