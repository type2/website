Subject: Tales of Angst &amp; Woe

Yesterday Da Spouse &amp; I escaped Ackworth at 6:00 AM
bound for the kultchur and fast living of Iowa City.
Arrived around 9:00, ate good food, drank fancy-pants
coffee, &amp; bought enuff books &amp; CD's to sag the suspension
of the 79 Bus.  Left about 7:00 PM when the temp. was
about +5 F &amp; winds were gusting up to 40 MPH, which made
for an ungodly wind-chill.  But hey, we had the trusty (?)
gas heater going and all was fine until we got to the west
edge of Iowa City, a distance of maybe 4 miles.

The gas heater made some bizarre noises and went dead.  It
was dark, and cold &amp; I didn't feel like crawling around to
attempt to solve the problem.  So on we went.  The wind sucked
the warm air right out of the Bus in no time, and by the time
we turned off the Interstate at Newton we were frozen.  Stopped
for coffee &amp; really began to shake.  I don't know how cold it
was inside the Bus, but I do know that my coffee cup had frozen
dregs in it.  Finally got home and took turns standing in front
of the oven trying to warm up.  

This morning it was -10 F and I had to get my 15 yr. old dog
to the vet ASAP.  Take the Camper--the heater works OK there,
right?  Right.  Except it had a flat.  Take the Mazda!  Dead
battery.  Back to the Ice Bus.  It started right up, but it
was a very cold trip, not helped at all by the fact that Joey
died en route.

The moral?  Do not get smug &amp; ignore your regular heater just
because you happen to have a gas heater.  Our trip back might
have been tolerable had I not been lazy.  (I promise, never, never
again...)  OK.  I'm done whining now.  Thanks for listening.  I
feel better.

Mike &quot;Damn! It's cold!&quot; Wright
