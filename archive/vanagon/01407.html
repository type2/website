RULES FOR COLLECTING VWS
This article was first written in regard to antique tractors by Roger Welch
who lives out in Nebraska. However the similarity between collecting tractors
and VWs was too good to miss so his rules were borrowed and a few words were
changed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULE l-Collect only one make and model of VW, nothing but early beetles or
barn-door bueses, for example.  When all your VWs are the same color and
shape, it's harder if not impossible for anyone to figure out how many VWs
you actually have.

RULE 2-Never line up your VWs, ever! Nothing distresses a difficult spouse
more than seeing twelve old VWs lined up, looking for all the world like a
pile of burning hundred dollar bills. Scatter the VWs around, a couple behind
the garage, one or two in the garage, another beside the garage, maybe a
couple at a friends house, so that it is not possible for anyone (if you know
who I mean) to see more than two or three from any one perspective. Your hobby
will be less 'irritating' that way.

RULE 3-For pretty much the same reason, don't number your VWs, give them
names. You'd be surprised how much less trouble you will have if you talk
about &quot;Hans&quot; rather than 2216122.

RULE 4-Early in your collecting, buy an VW you don't want. Then sell it as
quickly as you can. Don't worry about making any money on the transaction, the
main thing is to buy an VW and get rid of it. Then you can say, &quot;Yes my sweet,
I do have six VWs in the garage while our car is out in the weather. That
doesn't mean I will always have six VWs. Remember the one I got rid of ? I'm
thinking of selling another one any day now, so we can put our car in the
garage&quot;. If you have a friend who collects VWs make arrangements for him to
drop off an VW now and again. That way you can say, if anyone asks, that you
bought it. Then have him haul it off again and say you sold it. With this
system you establish your reputation for moderation.

RULE 5-Pay for your VWs with cashier's checks,or postal money orders, or cash
which leaves far less evidence than checks drawn on the family account. Once
you have gotten possession of another VW and paid for it, eat the stubs.
carbon copes  or receipts immediately. Such things have a way of becoming an
embarrassment later,  take it from me!

RULE 6-Now and then buy a wreck for 'parts' even if you don't need the parts.
In fact you might consider hauling a wreck or two on the same trailer or
truck, whenever you haul home a good VW. This is called 'liability averaging'.
If your significant other says something about having enough money for yet
another VW, but not enough for a new refrigerator, point indignantly to the
VWs on the trailer-the beautiful one, solid and in running condition for
which you paid $1,500.00 and the rusted hulks you got for $50.00 each. Then
huff, &quot;Snookums, I got those for little more than $500.00 each and the one in
the back is easily worth $2,000.00. That s a tidy profit of $400.00.&quot; See7
Doesn't that make you sound like an investment wizard?

RULE 7-When things get critical. consider dragging home an VW without
transmission or rear wheels. If there's a complaint you say, &quot;VW? What VW?
That's not an VW! That's only a front end, not even close to an VW.&quot; Then a
couple of weeks later bring home a rear end minus the radiator, engine and
front wheels. &quot;VW? What VW? That s no VW, that's only a rear end, not even
close to an VW!&quot; However, don t try this more than once every couple of years!

RULE 8-Have a dealer or friend call you now and then when you're not at home,
and tell your spouse, &quot;Bob told me to keep an eve on the VW going at the
auction on Saturdavy but it sold for $5,000.00, and I know there s no way a
financially cautious and responsible guy like Bob would pay that much, so I
didn't even make a bid on it for him.&quot;  Not only will this make you look really
good. but the next time you buy an VW say something like, &quot;Luvi-bear, this
beauty only cost me S1,000.00, which means we are $4.000.00 ahead of where we
d have been, if I'd have gotten the one before. If I keep saving money like
this, we'll be able to afford to go on that Caribbean cruise next winter.&quot; If
you say it fast enough, it might just work!

RULE 9-If your mate insults vour work calling it &quot;Rustoration&quot;, laugh a
lighthearted laugh, making it clear that VWs are NOT to you what shoes
were to Imelda Marcos.

RULE l0-If your situation worsens to the point where vour mate asks, &quot;Who do
you love more, me or your VWs?&quot; Whatever you do, don't ask for time to think
it over!
