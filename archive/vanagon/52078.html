Subject: Re: diesel fuel line

&gt; While installing my rebuilt starter today, I noticed that the fuel line 
&gt; between the fuel filter and the injector pump was cracked where it 
&gt; mounted to the pump.  I tried cutting it and reattatching it but it was 
&gt; too brittle. The local FLAPS told me that it was &quot;too high pressure&quot; for 
&gt; anything they carried.  So I called VW.  The parts guy said that this 3 
&gt; foot plastic tubing would cost me $39.40!!!! He also said that it head 
&gt; &quot;special metal ends&quot; on it which mine does NOT have. SO my question is, 
&gt; would it be a problem to run a length of regular diesel braided fuel 
&gt; hose, like the ones that run between the injectors?  Right now I have 
&gt; some rubber non-vw hose which Ive clamped on. Its working fine now, but 
&gt; Id rather have the better line.  Any ideas?
&gt; Do any diesel owners have the linethat the VW guy was talking about?

My Jetta TD has the crimped steel fitting, but only on the pump end, 
the filter end just uses a hose clamp. Try going to an industrial supplier 
- I got some 360 psi rated fuel hose for about $3-4 /ft. Since it is 
suction, rather than pressure, a stiff hose is a must.
