Subject: Re:repairing twin solexes

&gt;have about an eighth of an inch of play up and down which is causing
&gt;me idle problems.  There is a place in town that wants $320 to
&gt;re-manufacture the carbs which includes re-bushing the throttle shafts.
&gt;The alternative would be to purchase a set of aftermarket carbs but


I still don't know why we don't have a DIY rebushing option.  My Solex carbs 
in a '65 Porsche can be rebushed for $25 using a kit from Automotion in CA, 
and a complete gasket kit is another $15 I think.  Anyone seen such kits for 
the bus carbs, seems to be a common prob?
