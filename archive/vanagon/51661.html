 Sears (is anyone cringing) offered tires (195 SR 70 14) manufactured by 
 Michelin, wearing their name &quot;Guardsman Plus&quot; for $44 a piece.  They are 
 double ply tires with a polyester cord, a wet traction rating of &quot;A&quot;, a Temp

 rating of &quot;B&quot;, tread wear of 320 (50,000 miles according to the associate). 
  They fit the specs for Vanagon Syncros in the tire book Sears uses.
 
 The associate offered the tires on sale for $41 a piece and if the payment 
 was on credit, an additional 10% off.  Total price - $161.00 including 
 mounting, balancing is $8.99 each tire.
  &gt;&gt;
Is that 195/70 or 75.  If it is 70, you your are driving on overloaded tires
that will fail dangerously.  Read the wieght rating on the sidewall.  When
using P-metric tires on light trucks, you must also deduct an additional 10%
from the tires indicated capacity.
