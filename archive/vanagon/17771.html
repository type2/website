&gt;&gt;Well in the Digifant system, all injectors spritz at the same time. (well
&gt;&gt;that is how it reads in the book?!). Seems kinda wasteful...

I once swapped the electrical connectors between cyl #1 and #2 of the injectors.
If the injectors are individually controlled this means both cylinders would not
get fuel at the right time. Well, the engine did not seem care. It idled as
if nothing happened. ECU only controls the amount of fuel to be injected but 
not timing, I think.

My old volvo 264 and 262c have mechanical CI system. The injectors constantly
inject fuel. I guess the fuel accumulates in the intake until the intake valve
opens and take them in, boom and gone...
