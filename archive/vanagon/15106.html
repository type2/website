&gt;	My 1985 Westphalia camper has been in the shop at ANTONION 
&gt;VOLKSWAGEN dealership in Sunnyvale, California
&gt;James Cook
&gt;

Hi James, is there ANY form of 'official memo' available from them, or is 
this a case by case basis that the dealer must contact VW to ask for $$. 
Sorry to bug you on this, I have 2 wasserboxers that could use slight TLC, 
especially if it's free/20% cost.    tim s.
