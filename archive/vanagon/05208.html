Comments: I think this is one tire that the Bently manual recommends
 for my vehicle.  It's my benchmark tire that all others have been
 measured against.
Original tires were Continentals that only lasted about 25K miles.
Next a set of Goodyear radials were driven for over 70K miles.
A set of the afore mentioned Michelins were driven for ~50K miles.
I went cheap and put a set of Pirelli P3 radials on. These were not
reinforced and began separation of the sidewall/tread at ~20K miles.
Since then I have used the above mentioned Michelin XZX w/good results.

I live in Southern California where we don't have seasons like some
of you do.  I once read a post from someone in New York that stated
they got their dietary salt intake just driving down the road in winter.
