&gt; &gt;&gt;on my 82 Vanagon is for?

&gt; i have a strange something like this in my 75 deluxe camper, what the hell is
&gt; it?
&gt; avery
&gt; 

I think the one on the '75 was the outlet plug to power an small air compressor
for inflating the tires.

I don't know on the Vanagons if it's the same thing or not.
