Subject:      RE.: Oil Pressure Gauge . . .



Just catching up on the mail I noticed that David points out that you can't
lactate the oil temp at the pressure gauge. I have heard this before, and that
this isn't event the best place for the pressure gauge, but I also ran across
the suggestion in a Bus Boys catalog that you could use the combo pressure
gauge and and a temp. gauge in the t fitting they sell. They also have a nice
little plate that lets you mount three gauges in that space below the radio.
Could you follow up David, thanks.
