Subject: rad hose vs. muffler pipe ?


The nightmare begins...   I need to replace one of the long steel pipes in
the crewcab, rusted beyond belief, don't know how it was holding water.
Anyhow. OEM is vinyl coated steel, and is $220!!  And in typical VW style..
the newer plastic pipe is not backwards compatible!!  SO, off to the muffler
shop I go, (called all FLAPS for hose that diam: NA)   Anyone see any
corrosion/other probs using galvalume muffler pipe in stead of OEM or
rubber? Reply ASAP, this will be a done deal by the end of the day.  many
thanks, tim
