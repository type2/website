Subject: Propane setups

Howdy Volks,
I  am trying to setup the interior of my Westie,  and need some 
 opinions or experience. I am building my own cabinets and want to 
 include a sink, water tank and icebox, with the idea of maintaining a 
 large open area in the center of the Bus.  I am really turned on by 
 the thought of onboard propane to run a small catalytic heater or 
 stove in the winter (never sleep with these on!) but don't want to 
 cart around the tank and stuff year round. What I am thinking is to 
 run tubing to several points or a manifold and out to a port(?) on the 
 outside of the van, this way I could throw a large bottle on the rack 
 on top during cold spells, drive to were ever,  pull it down and 
 attach it when we stop. Would this work? What sort of coupling could I 
 use on the outside? Do they make a kit for this?

Thanks for your input
Clay

PS Just a note on unvented heaters- 4 people are dead in a small town 
 south of here due to an unvented propane space heater in a cabin, it 
 will happen faster than you think!
