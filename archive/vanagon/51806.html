Subject: Re: (intro) forgot ...


&gt; ..to mention my 1984 Rabbit.  Got it as a shiny baby and it still runs -
&gt; though it can't keep an alignment for beans and is now wearing through tires
&gt; in 6 months.  Any advice?  I'm thinking a good source of cheap used tires is
&gt; the way to go.  Cyndi

Ball joints are a possibility, and the cheapest and easier part to 
replace on the front end. I did my Jetta for ~ $50 - alignment was 
fine before, but steering was vague on sweeping corners. New ball 
joints helped a lot. After that, tie rod ends and A arm bushings are 
next, but harder to do, and more money...
