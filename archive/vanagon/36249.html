Subject: Paint Color '81

I have seen a list of available colors for each year, somewhere, does 
anyone know where it is? My Westy was built  10/80 ('81 model?)
 and according to PPG it shouild be Carmel, for the model year 80 the color was 
Assuan Brown. Are the body colors by model year, or could I have the 
Assuan Brown since mine was manufactured in '80? Also PPG may have 
the colors wrong!
I'm trying to get some touch up paint.
Thanks
