Subject: Grendel: Tires


Used.  P185/70-14's.  $18 each, including balancing and new valves.  Rims
were $25 each at a local junky, one who takes plastic.  Tires are Michlin
(sp?) for two, 'Hercules' for the other pair.  Grendel's original five tires
included a 185/70-14 so I now have a full set plus a spare.

Engine is not a problem.  And now the tires are not a problem.  Lights,
brakes, steering, cabin heat, wipers.  Anything else?

One thing at a time.
