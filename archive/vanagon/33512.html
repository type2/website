Subject: Idiot Factor: Mid-Desert/June

The very patient Mrs. and I decided to drive the '57 Single to the 1994 SOTO
meet in Escondido &lt;near SanDiego&gt;/Classic Weekend from Phoenix, AZ. We're
talkin' June here. The usual drill is to gather the faithful very very early
in the morning and caravan across the desert in a manner similar to the old
pioneers. We all proceed along I-10 west bound until we reach Wintersburg
which just east of the AZ/Cali border. (BFE) A &quot;funny&quot; noise was coming out
of the engine compartment but we couldn't locate the culpurit. As soon as we
start down the on ramp the noise develops into a bag of cats and incoming
artillery. Boom, the alternator pulley turns into a &quot;bouncing betty.&quot; =(
A buddy of mine ended up driving into Blythe and then on to Bakersfield to
locate a replacement. After a 120 mile round trip in now blazing heat (I
mean, BLAZING heat)  and stupidly high price paid for a kew-el chrome one as
the only choice, we discovered that there was a junkyard just on the
otherside of the interstate that had hoards of bugs and buses of all ages.
DOH!!!! The trip and my reputation were a bit tattered after that. Needless
to say, I was relagated to bringing up the rear after that.
