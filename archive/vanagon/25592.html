&gt; i know, the '73 1700cc engine doesn't have a heat riser... I did make
&gt; sure that the engine had been tuned and the accelerator pump was
&gt; working. Any hints on this?? I've heard of a device that could be
&gt; attached to the carburator to provide additional heating... can anyone 
&gt; expand on this as to where to obtain it and how helpful it is??

I would bet money that your problem is the distributor.  I had the same
symptoms when I had the 009 in my '73.  I put the stock vacuum advance/
retard unit back in and it runs like a million bucks.

A wise person once said, &quot;Don't second guess the VW engineers&quot;.  I'm not
sure that's always true, but in this case, it is.  Having a vacuum
canister on your distributor is not going to rob you of power!
