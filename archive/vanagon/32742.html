Subject: Back Home Again (Ain't it Good?)

Que Paso, Bus Aficionandos (Fanaticos)?

Been gone for more than a month now.  Right before we left for Mexico I was
gonna unsubscribe from the list.  So, with all the packing, planning and
fifty other things to do, I forgot to.  Sorry, Gerald.

BTW, it wasn't a VW Bus trip, although we did rent a new Beetle in Mazatlan
(it was the cheapest car they had).  Reminded me of the old days, driving a
brand-new, air-cooled Volswagen!  Almost all the taxis there were either
Safaris (Things) or a newer, smaller variation of the Thing.  All were based
on the 1600 Type I engine.

We traveled mostly by train.  Went through the Copper Canyon.  South of
Mazatlan, the Beetle took us to sleepy little beach villages many gringos
apparently haven't heard of yet.  Next time we'll definitely take the VW Bus.

Hung out with local fishermen and Mexican families mostly.  One of the best
Mexico trips I've had.

The reason we didn't take the '79 VW Bus was that, while I had replaced the
engine and tranny with new units, the front end was shaky (as was my
confidence in the rest of the bus at the moment).

We've been back for a week now and, when it gets warm enough outside (50+
degrees F), I slip into my Old Fart brand jumpsuit and crawl under the bus.

The bus runs great, but the old problem crops ups again: it idles too fast.
I've checked and/or replaced all the vacuum lines, etc.  Still idles around
1200 RPM. It's impossible to adjust the timing to factory specs this way.  I
got rid of the EGR valve and capped off the connection to the intake
manifold, as it had rusted through in a couple of places near the exhaust
system.  Replaced the original exhaust system with a dual muffler quiet
pack.  The points and condensor were replaced with a Pertronix magnetic
points replacement module.  It seems to work fine except that the dwell is
set at a constant 59, not 47 or so, where I think I want it to be.  I tried
adjusting the &quot;air gap&quot; betweeen the magnetic unit and the rest of the
gizmo, but it stays at 59 degrees anyway. 

Anyone know whether it's possible to adjust the dwell with the Pertronix?
The scanty documentation that came with the Pertronix unit didn't mention
anything about this and many other things.

We drove to El Paso and parked the car in a guarded lot.  The first-class
bus ride (with movies!) from Juarez to Chihuahua was $10.  The train ride,
through the Copper Canyon to the coast, was about $20.  So, we were rico
Gringos, with the peso hovering around the 7.5 to 1 dollar zone.  Last year
at this time it was three-point-something to the dollar.  A good lunch with
a soda is usually about seven pesos (less than a buck).  A liter (una
ballena) of Dos Equis, Carta Blanca or Pacifico is 6 pesos (80 cents).  In
Mazatlan, the hotel on the beach with two double beds is $8 a night total
(for three people).  Unleaded gasoline (Magna Sin) costs about the same as here.

Good, though, to be back in the land where you can brush your teeth with tap
water instead of bottled water or beer!  Since I resubscribed to the list
last night, I got 130 letters.  Geeez!

Back to VWs: I'm intimidated at the prospect of rebuilding the front end.
I've got all the parts: new ball joints, tie rods, bearings, brakes,
hydraulics, etc. It seems that I've always avoided front end work, farming
it out to a shop or someone.  Really, how hard is it to do?  I mean, I've
replaced shocks, brake pads and repacked bearings, but should I let a local
garage deal with the ball joints, etc.?  I'm willing, I just don't want to
get stuck with stuck ball joints in the driveway.  (I don't have a hydraulic
press.) 

TIA for any help.
