Subject: Vanagon coolant leakage



Exactly!!! I just paid $$ for this work at the local dealer, because
I was too lazy to replace it myself.  In my cae, the hose attached to the
flange in question had a leak in it, and the dealer *casually* mentioned
that they replaced the flange also....  I wonder if there should be
any general warranty and/or recall condition that applies to this...

Then again, with over 106K miles, I guess most warranties can be expected
to go void  :-(

&gt;
&gt;   &quot;A damaged plastic coolant return flange located at the rear of the 
&gt;   right cylinder head can cause coolant leakage on 86-88 models.  The 
&gt;   plastic flange is close to the engine's drive belts and can be 
&gt;   damaged by a loose or broken belt.  Engine orverheating can also warp 
&gt;   the sealing surface of the flange, causing coolant leakage and more 
&gt;   overheating.
&gt;
&gt;   To correct (or avoid) these problems, replace the damaged plastic 
&gt;   flange with a metal coolant return flange, P/N 025 121 160 D, and 
&gt;   gasket P/N N 901 685 01.&quot;
