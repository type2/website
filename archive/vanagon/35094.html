&gt;
&gt;Bob,
&gt;
&gt;you suggested Aaron uses &quot;elephant's feet&quot; in his T-IV. I just wanted to 
&gt;remind you that I couldn't find any for that engine--although that 
&gt;shouldn't imply that they don't exist. :) 
&gt;

They exist.  The T4 engine I'm in the process of tearing down has stock
rockers stamped '7R  51' and a forge mark.  They accepted both Berg and NOPI
swivel feet.  I haven't tried them with the ball-type swivel foot from
J.C.Whitney.  

Even though the threads were the same I tried them by assembly, not just
inspection.  They went together just fine.

I wonder if T4 engines equipped with hydraulic cam followers use a different
ratio'd rocker, one having a different thread?  By measurement, these rockers
(from an engine with mechanical lifters) appear to be 1.4:1 (1.75&quot; to 1.25&quot;).
 Hydraulics usually build the ratio into the cam.   Mebbee? 

Sorry to be so mumbly.  I need more T4 data.

-Bob
