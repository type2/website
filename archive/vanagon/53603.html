Subject: 85 WEsty-2nd clutch bleed in 1 month?

Hi everyone - this is Jim Hall again, late of Minneapolis and was 
having clutch trouble right around Thanksgiving. Well, I followed 
list advice (THANKS ALL),had clutch bled and it worked fine til a few
days ago when same symptoms reoccured (hard shifting, not wanting to 
go from gear to gear w/out double clutching). I bled the slave 
cylinder this afternoon and am going out for the test drive now.
Could H20/air in lines still be the culprit? It has been just crippling 
cold here in MN as of late (a balmy 20 degrees today - hence working
on/under the van weather for these parts) Or should I be looking at
replacing the slave or master cylinder? The fluid was a really nasty 
dark color plus some air. I don't see any leaks around the master
cylinder (for what that view is worth) or at the slave. 
I've read every thing in the archives on this for the past 
few years last night. I'm back on the list now so post directly to
me or the list as you could see fit. 
&gt;From the looks of list entries this is happening all over the
place with this cold weather.
Thanks alot - Jim Hall -
