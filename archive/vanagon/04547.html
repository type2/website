Subject: Esp For Eurovan Owners

I've forgotten who owns the Eurovans or I would have addressed this more 
specifically.

I've just been made aware of a problem with the tires on my '93 Eurovan 
and I'm wondering if any others have (had) the problem.

I just got back off an extended road trip and dutifully went to have the 
tires rotated .... no problem there.

After I drove a few miles withthe rotated tires I was convinced that I 
had put tank treads on the van.

I took it back to the dealer and they recommended that I have the tires 
balanced ... I did ... no change.

One of the mechanics mentioned that my tires were &quot;choppy&quot; and had 
numerous flat spots.

After a long conversation about how and why, I was told that somehow my 
rear wheels were probably out of alignment. (I don't understand that part 
at all but ...)

The dealer wanted to sell me a new set of tires

Something in the back of my mind signalled me to check with the VW 
dealer; I did.

Once I explained the problem to the VW dealer's service person, the 
comment was &quot;Oh yes, we've noted some problems with those tires on THAT 
van. If you'll leave the van with us we'll do what we can to straighten 
the problem.

Well in the suddeness, I could not leave the van but plan to take it back 
on Monday or Tuesday. I've got about 28,200 miles on the van now.

QUESTIONS:

Has anyone else had problems like this?

Any idea why or how it happens?

Any idea about what I can expect from the dealer or VW USA?
