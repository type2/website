Subject: bash at martha's


OK, it's official:  the &quot;bash&quot; at my place is happening on Saturday,
March 19th, beginning at 5 p.m and going thru as late as any of
you like.  Below are people who indicated an interest in attending;
please confirm so I can plan the food amounts, and anyone else wishing
to attend, you're welcome, too!  I plan to make pasta to feed everyone,
and will supply coffee.  Guess the rest can be potluck - let me know!

If anyone wants to stay over nite, they can either camp in my driveway,
or slumber party on the living room floor.  Please let me know, too,
whether you plan to do this, so I can plan breakfast!  :)
