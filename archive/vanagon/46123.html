Subject: problems with holes


I seem to be having some problems with this engine swap, all having to do 
with holes.

First, on the exaust of my new to me engine there is that small hole 
sticking straight up which had a conection to connect a single carb, but 
I have dual carbs so, i'm not using this connection, how can I close up 
this hole, do they make a cover, or could I make one, out of some 
aluminum, or do I have to fill them likeon my old exaust which i'm not 
using because it has a hole in it.

Also cleaning the new engine I put rags wraped in plastic in all the 
holes, I used Gunk Engine Brite, a toothbrush, and a hose. It leaked 
some, not much but will this hurt me, do I need to rebuild and clean 
everything?

Finally, a simple one, there are two puposeful looking holes in my rear 
wheel wells, what are those for? Should I cover them?

One more, I almost forgot, how can I install a gas heater, the on I'm 
looking at has a factory installed hole in the engine compartment, I 
didn't see if it vented into the cabin or what.

Thanks in advance.
