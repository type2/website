Subject:      new vw/winnebago campers

just to give all of you an idea of how delightful it is to live in this
student-infested armpit of LA (Left Alabama), i got a letter in the mail
today from a vw-winnebago (yup. quite a coincidence, ain't it?) in Columbus,
MS ... about 60 miles from here, and only about half the size of this town.
he invites me over to see the new Winnebago (doesn't mention the vw) and
says he has THREE to choose from!!!!

what the hell. how's he gonna know that i can't afford one. :)
