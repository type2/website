Joel, or any one else interested. I tried out two of the three
suggestions and came up blank. Here's what happened: tested the cold
start valve as per the Haynes manual. After the ignition is turned on
after 5 or so seconds the light connected between the two points
slowly dims signalling the cold start valve has shut down as it
should (this was done only with engine cold). Now the interesting this is that I couldn't repeat this
procedure; maybe it only works once when firing up?

The other test was on the aux. air regulator and as per Haynes the
vacuum slowly diminishes as the engine heats up. But there was
something I didn;t expect, in order for the engine to run I had to put
my finger over the hole of the intake bellows which goes to the main
air intake and sensor (the other end of the tube from the aux. air reg.). Is this normal. In other words should the
engine only run when this is closed or sealed to the air regulator?
BTW putting the finger over the air regulator end does slow the engine
a bit.

ANY ideas so far?

The next thing on the list is to check for air leaks. I did check fuel
pressure at the take up and there was no difference whether the vacuum
was connected or disconnected (26 psi both ways) is this bad?

Also scraped many leads and connectors....
The vacuum gauge registers a slight late ignition delay but I am
positive that this the timing is correct. The gauge which serves as
both a fule pressure and vacuum tester may not be the greatest.
