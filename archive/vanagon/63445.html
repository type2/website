Subject:      Company Webpage &amp; Vanagon Dealer Dashtray/Cupholder

OK, I've got a bare-bones, but informative home web-page up for the
company now.  Put it on your Web Browser for future use.  More stuff to
be added later as well as an on-line catalog throughout the month of
August.

URL is http://www.c-zone_dot_net/jim96003/oldvolks.htm

For those on the Vanagon list that were discussing what the Dealer
Dashtray/Cupholder looked like from the factory, I uploaded a color
scannned jpeg image from the brochure to a separate URL.  It's the best I
can do at the moment.  I may upload a larger scan tomorrow for a better
view.

URL for that is http://www.c-zone_dot_net/jim96003/cupholdr.htm

It's linked to and from the home page address given above as well.
