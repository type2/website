Subject: Re: VW Micro-Bus Repair Books

&gt;	Can someone recommend a book specifically geared toward repair
&gt;AND maintainence (sp.) of older VW vans (like the micro-bus)? 
&gt;	OF MAIN CONCERN is the fact that I'm NOT mechanically 'informed'-
&gt;so it'd need to be like one of those 'VW's for Dummies' or 'Idiot's Guide...'

'VW Beetle and Transporter, a guide to purchase and restoration' (or
something like that) by Porter, published by Haynes Books. This has lots
of photo's of mechanical and body work restoration and loads of useful 
tips and advice. A lot of it is biased towards bugs but it is still 
relevent, and there is stuff in there that you won't find anywhere else 
(like replacing the front panel or retrimming your interior).
