Derek-
Thanks for asking such pertinent questions about the Syncro fender
rubbers.  I have a few of my own:
I have a slate-grey 86 Syncro GL, and WHITE RUBBERS would look just
terrible.
a) Are there black ones available?
b) What exactly are they made of?....plastic or rubber??
c) How exactly do they attach?
d) Where can we see a picture/ read a description of them?
e) How long do they tend to last?
d) Has anyone done business with Zeidler successfully before??

I apologise if these points have already been discussed, but I just
bought a Syncro and have just joined the list...bear with me.
