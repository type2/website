Subject: Blood trail - Need 1600 case (L.A area)

Greetings,

After rebuilding the guts of my '71 1600 SP, 
a few mechanics and I have determined that the
hideous trail and pools of blood I'm leaving 
all over southern California are coming from 
a crack in the case.  So...anyone know of any
leads to a reliable replacement in the greater
Los Angeles area?

My current engine is of the 'B' series, and I've
heard here that they are known to be more brittle
than others.  Any suggestions on what I should
look for?  

Much appreciation,
