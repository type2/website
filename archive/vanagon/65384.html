&gt;Greetings all,
&gt;I am heading out the door to the Burning Man fest north of Reno.  Hope
&gt;the bus does well.  Should be interesting and hot.  Got the water and
&gt;all.  I will report on the trip next week, anyone going look for the
&gt;blue vanagon westy w/ list sticker.  See YA.  Ken.

Ken and Bob Emery and all the others who attended Burnin' Man,

How was it?  I visited the burnin' man web site and am very curious to hear
the stories.  Any trip reports out there?
