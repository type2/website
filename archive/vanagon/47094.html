Subject:  Coolant Temperature Gauge Light flashes
          intermittently / continuously

Flashing coolant temperature light may be caused by:
- Low coolant level.
- Coolant level indicator.
- Electrical connections on gauge.

* Check coolant level, top up if necessary.
* Check coolant level sensor for continuity.
* Check for loose connection of wiring at terminal 14 connectors of
  instrument cluster, nuts of temperature gauge, ground connection
  to body and engine ground.  Repair if necessary.

If temperature gauge light still flashes:
* Replace low coolant level control unit
