Subject: Re: Westfalia Noise

I don't have a Westy, but I have a similar problem with noise. My solution
was floor carpeting. I bought a 9' x 12' remnant and used the leftovers
from carpeting the rear compartment as insulation/soundproofing for the
interior panels. Home Depot sells carpet pad adhesive for $5/quart, of
which I used maybe 1/4th. If you aren't particular about color/design, I
would say to get the thickest shag carpet you can find (you don't see it
anyway, unless you like that sort of thing :)). For the roof and kick
panels, I used 1/2&quot; x 4' x 8' sheets of styrofoam, which has really good
insulative properties, but I'm not so sure about its sound deadening
qualities. I'm thinking about fastening the tarboards salvaged from the
engine compartment of a baywindow bus to the ceiling of the engine
compartment of my splittie to further reduce engine noise. Bob Hoover has a
sermon on insulation that you might want to check out.

&gt;I have had some success at reducing noise levels in my 84 Westfalia.
&gt;I bought 6 sheets (app. 4x6x0.5&quot;) of closed cell neoprene sold for sound
&gt;insulation at a cost of $120.  I used this to line much of the body panels
&gt;and doors and also the rear cargo area and under the rear seat.  In the
&gt;last two areas I doubled the thickness in most areas and sandwiched a layer
&gt;of aluminum foil between them (on advice of a manual about sound proofing
&gt;aircraft that came with the foam).  I also put two layers on the underside
&gt;of the engine cover (you have to make some cut outs to avoid putting pressue 
&gt;on some components). I have also lined the floors and also the front part
&gt;of the poptop roof that is exposed when the roof is down (this has the 
&gt;advantage of preventing condensation on the roof as well as keeping in
&gt;heat).  In addition to the foam I have packed fibreglass insulation into
&gt;as many spaces as I can reach easily (much cheaper than foam but probably not
&gt;as effective for sound insulation).  Finaly I have used canned foam to fill
&gt;in some of the major body pillars.
&gt;
&gt;The result?
&gt;
&gt;Well it neither sounds or looks like a mercedes! But it is a bit quieter.
&gt;Engine noise is very much reduced and doors sound &quot;dead&quot; when closed.
&gt;I am sure it is also alot warmer/colder as a result of the extra heat 
&gt;insulation.  It is still not quiet though.  I am thinking of putting some
&gt;sound insulation in the wheel wells since alot of sound is coming from the
&gt;tires.  Any more ideas?
