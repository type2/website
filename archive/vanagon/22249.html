Subject: Re: sway bar or stabilizer?

hello
a quality aftermarket anti-sway bar is one of the least expensive and most
effective ways to improve the handling of a vw bus. particularly on pre
vanagon models in which the center of pressure is drastically in front of the
center of gravity (ie when in a cross wind the vehicle has a dangerous
tendency to anti-correct itself and get blown in the direction of the wind)
later models ala vanagons better addressed this problem by pushing more
weight, hence the center of gravity, to the front of the vehicle. I'm
babbling again sorry... any way aftermarket sway bars available from witney
et al  are an excellent investment. they have a substantially beefier cross
section than their stock counterparts. to achieve true farvergnugen i also
recommennd the addition of rear anti sway bar. the combination of the two
causes the veihicle to understeer just ever so slightly allowing one to
actually accelerate through a turn and stay on the road. perhaps not what you
want for your son, but the difference in driveability/rideability is truely
undescribeable. the vehicle will handle much better in xwinds and at highway
speeds. as far as your stock part breaking, you've got me there. the front
sway bar was designed to keep the front wheels more or less coaxial (except
while turning:)  by definition it is a structural suspension element subject
to a great deal of torsional force. does the break appear to be a twist break
or a shear break. please e me i'm curious; the stockers are pretty wimpy but
i've still never seen one break. i imagine repeatedly hitting curbs or
parking the vehicle off plumb could contribute to long term fatigue but i
would be more inclined to think that somebody (not necessarily your son) 
probably hit something with it  (like a parking barrier)???
please feel free to send mail directly to me should you have further
questions or comments.
remember free advice is worth every penny
