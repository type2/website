&gt; pretty neat.

	The Neuspeed city lights are $24.95.  They only work with H4 bulbs
though, so unless you've done the South African headlight conversion, or
live where H4's came stock, they won't work for you. All that they are is 
something like a flashlight bulb mounted on a metal ring that goes
between the H4 and the headlight reflector.  The flashlight bulb sits
right below your normal bulb.  Then you splice the wires into your parking
lights.  The metal ring may be able to be modified to fit the normal 9004
Halogens, or you could duplicate this idea yourself by making your own
ring or drilling a hole through the back of the headlight reflector and
mounting the little bulb through there.
	The city lights look really cool, especially around twilight.  Of 
course everything looks really cool around twilight;)

&gt; Thanks
