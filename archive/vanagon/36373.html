Subject: 1980 Vanagon Gas Heater

I've finally pulled the Vanagon out of the garage and starting getting it
ready for spring. My 1980 Vanagon has a gas heater in it. I never drive it
in the winter. I've had very bad luck with gas heaters in the past. I was
thinking of taking it out of the Vanagon and unloading it. It will serve no
purpose and only add extra weight. 

I was looking at the Bently manual and it looks like the gas heater is an
intergral part of the whole heat system. I don't want to disable the heat
from the heat exchangers. Anyone have any ideas on this subject?
