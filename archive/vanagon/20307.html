Subject: transmission front mount
Date: Thu,  6 Jul 1995 11:33:05 GMT

This is directed primarily to those bus owners of the 1968 to 1979
group, though I suspect that the same kind of thing could happen in
all years.

I noticed a week or so ago that the shift lever was a little loose,
well, not loose really; but I could feel the whole engine or maybe the
transmission move when I let out the clutch. Kind of like when the
upper two bolts that hold the engine case to the transmission bell
housing are missing. So I checked. All four bell housing bolts were
good and tight. And the rear engine mounts are fine. So, what is the
problem?

I drove for a few more days. Then it dawned on me to check the front
transmission mount. Sure enough, the upper of the two studs was
missing along with its nut, and the nut on the lower stud was also
missing. Scary! If the shift linkage had come apart, I think that
the front of the transmission would have fallen on the ground.

I replaced the missing stud and nuts using plenty of locktite. Works
great. No more feeling like the bus is going to fall apart.

Anybody else have an experience like this?
