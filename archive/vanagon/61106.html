Subject: 1986 Syncro headliner replacement advice/wisdom sought!

Dear list members:

I bought an 86 syncro some weeks ago and I am washing the uphostery,
the rugs, etc.  The car last worked on a ranch and is very dusty!

I want to remove the headliner to get at the dust behind and above it.
The headliner itself has lost its elasticity and has yellowed.

My questions are these:

(1)  How does one remove and replace a headliner ** neatly ** ?
(2)  Where can one get a good price on a replacement headliner?
(3)  Are there any special warnings/advice you might offer?

Thanks very much,  Stop me before I ruin something!
