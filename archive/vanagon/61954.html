Cory,

The piece you describe is the pressure regulator, so sounds like you need
to get it replaced  or rebuilt,  BUT - before you do, try taking a metal
thing that's not too heavy - like the end of an adjustable wrench, and
banging on one of the pipe connections at the end.   May unstick something
(you have nothing to lose with the regulator, but try not to damage the
compression nut...).

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;	I ran into a problem during my recent trip to New Mexico.  When I
&gt;try to use the propane to power the fridge propane leaks out of the grey
&gt;metal piece down by the propane tank.  This is the piece after the main
&gt;valve that is concealed by the black plastic cover.  The propane leaks out
&gt;of a round hole, mabye 1/16 of an inch in diameter.  Bentley does not
&gt;discuss the propane tank other than removal/installation.  So my questions
&gt;are, what is this grey metal piece where the leak is coming from for?
&gt;Have any of you had this problem?  And what can I do to fix it?  I am not
&gt;currently able to get at the archives so forgive me if this has been
&gt;covered in detail.  TIA.
