Subject:      No water indicator lights.

Hello all. My water level indicator lights (below the stove) do not
light up on my '85 westie. The lights for the battery indicator and
fridge pilot light work fine. I did the little test described in Bently
and I couldn't get any of the water level lights to light. Bently says
this might be a bad panel. Question 1) for those who have one working,
does the red water level light when there is no water in the tank or
must there be some water to get it to light? Question 2, anyone know
where to get a new panel if it is indeed the problem? (Cringing) How
much would one of these cost?

Thanks
