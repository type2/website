Subject:      Programmable Intermittent Winshield Wiper

Can anyone help me with this one?  I have a '93 EV with programmable
intermittent windshield wipers, and think they're great.  Before
'92, VW used the fixed delay intermittent relays.  The only
difference between the fixed and programmable types is the relay ( I
verified this by swapping it with the one in my '90 Vanagon ).

So I ordered the relay. 357 955 531, replaced by 1HM 955 531,
replaced by.... 1HM 955 531C.  To make a long story short, the 1HM
955 531C  is a fixed intermittent relay.  It works that way in both
the Vanagon and EV. Does anyone know where to get a programmable type
or its part number?

Thanks.
