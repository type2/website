Subject: 84 Westy emgine missing/fuel starved

Hi,  &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; is an 84 Westy with 170K miles on original engine,
resident in San Luis Obispo, CA.  We just completed a 2500 mile trip
throung Ca and OR.  While in Hood River, OR she started miss firing and
hesitating intermittantly.  It got worse but not so bad that we had to do
much except to check plug leads etc.  I decided that we had picked up some
bad fuel and topped up with fuel and the problem went away as we drove home
without further trouble.  This included a long stretch of Highway 5 in &gt;100
F temps.

On arrival home the problem has resurfaced - intermittent miss firing and
occasional difficult to start. Also cuts out while idling sometimes.  This
has been going on for about a week now.  I have checked the plug leads,
checked the idle stabilizer and am about to check the fuel flow.  Of course
this morning she is running fine!

Any thoughts on what to check next?  I cannot decide if it is fuel or
spark.  I have Bentley so I can refer to that if advised.

We were hoping to go to Kings Canyon this weekend as a last fling for the
summer but not unless we find the problem.  Any help appreciated.  TIA.
Don
