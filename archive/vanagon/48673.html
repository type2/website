 Has anyone had any experience in moving an inoperative Vanagon a couple of
 hundred miles using a Tow Dolly with the rear of the Vanagon mounted on the
 TD axle and the front wheels on the road surface?  The Vanagon is without
 engine, without spare tire and with one rear tire of questionable
 character.

  U-haul tow dolys work great.  I would leave the rear wheels on the ground
for balance.  I once towed front end down and it was a bit unstable. Remove
the rear drive shafts if needed,(auto matic or trans not supported).   Make
sure the surge brakes on the dolly are working.  They actually tow quite easy
this way.
