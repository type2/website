&gt;  ...    manual I have indicates that all European and UK Type IV engined

would you believe that NOTHING in any of the books even mentions sodium-
filled valves? (except that one little paragraph in Bentley). notice that it
mentions ONLY the exhaust valves.  said exhaust valves were almost always
the ones to break first (especially on cylinder #3, on the beetle engines).

&gt;  Incidentally, they are also the only models to have exhaust afterburning
&gt;  courtesy of air injection. Is there a connection? Were Sodium cooled valves
&gt;  just a fad? Do all the European buses use them, even though they have never

i think it was just an attempt to solve the old beetle engine problem of
#3 exhaust valve breaking. and they found out that the Type 4 engine didn't
really need them (and therefore some costs could be eliminated by getting
rid of the more expensive valves). it may be that fuel injection came along
about then, and with more control over the mixture (i.e., idiot-owner won't
be dorking with it as much), they could keep the temperatures more closely
under control.

NONE of the german books even mention sodium, so i have to assume (?) that
they never used them.

&gt;   - I'm probably the only person on the planet who's curious about this.
yes, but we like you anyway. :)
