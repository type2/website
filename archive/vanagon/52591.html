&gt;I just came in, after letting the engine warm up to the point where the

&gt;and coolant was leaking at a radip rate from the right side of the 
&gt;engine. FIF.
&gt;
&gt;Could a bum water pump be the problem? 

Doubtful.  The waterpump is at the left/rear of the engine.

&gt;How can I tell ?  what should I look for?

Remove the engine hatch.  Clean things up and look for leaks from the top -
there are several hoses &amp; connections that could be leaking.  If you don't
find it here, look around from underneath.  If you still can't see the leak,
remove the sheet metal under the right head and look some more.  Look
carefully, a small leak can run around from the top of an object (like a
cylinder head) and drip off the bottom &amp; thus look like a like from where the
drip is, instead of where the real leak is.

Cross your finger &amp; pray it's not the cylinder head gasket leak!

Good luck,
Jim Davis
