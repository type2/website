&gt;    &gt;........
&gt;    Hey you guys,
&gt;    
&gt;    Just order something from them, i.e., send them some $$$, and they'll be
&gt;    glad to pay attention and send a catalogue with the order.
&gt;    &gt;........
&gt;
&gt;Since I am probably one of several who only
&gt;knows of them from this list and only knows
&gt;how to reach them via their non-functioning
&gt;AOL account, perhaps you could tell me what
&gt;the physical address is?
&gt;
