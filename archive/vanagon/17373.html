Subject: RE: Make A Wish

I know that Lars posted that this is a farce, and now I feel like a fool for
perpetrating something that should never have happened.  I deserve any flame I
get, and as Gerald pointed out, could be doing a disservice to Craig or his
family, or as Lars pointed out, the hospital that is still getting the get well
cards.

I am sorry and promise never, ever to post anything that I have not personally
verified, even if I trust the source, as they can be duped just like I was.

Again my humble apologies,
terry
