Howdy Volks -

I know it's not Friday, but I won't be here, I'll be skiin' with the kids. 

Whilst perusing the most important section of my local newspaper, I 
happened upon a cartoon involving a VW Bus.  The artist resides in my 
neck of the woods, I called him and was given verbal permission to 
scan and post his cartoon.  However, not having a site to post it on, 
I am offering a scanned version of it for anyone who wishes.

The cartoon is called Roadskill and involves the antics of a squirrel 
attempting to cross the road of life, and the things that happen 
along the way.

We see -
A VW bus approaching with the squirrel in front talking in a monologue 
&quot;Certain types of cars have very predictable driving habits!&quot;  
side view with the squirrel in the lead 
&quot;for instance, take the VW bus . . &quot; 
rear view with a variety of bumper stickers, Save the Whales, Beam Me 
Up, No Nukes, Free Peoria, Grateful Dead Skull, Peace sign, squirrel 
safely to the side
&quot;they always veer to the left!&quot;

He is always on the lookout for cartoon subjects, and having had 
several VW busses in the past can relate.  If you have any VW bus 
ideas for him to ponder, drop him a snail mail.  I'll post any more 
VW ones that crop up.

Drop me a pmail if you want a scanned version of the cartoon, just 
let me know what version you want, GIF, JPEG, etc. I can convert to 
a variety.  As a GIF it's only about 26K.
