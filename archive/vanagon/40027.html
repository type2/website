Hi all

Steve asks:
&gt;&gt;'6? Series IIA SW - factory fitted Lucas immobiliser

&gt;Is this by chance a Sunbeam Alpine or Tiger? If it's an Alpine, then it
*snip*

Whooooops. I didn't know there's a lot of &quot;Series x&quot; vehicles out there,
referred to as such. This one's a Land Rover. I'll change the .sig, maybe,
make it clearer :-)

I don't know which year it is, exactly, 'cause these things were shipped in
boxes and assembled locally. So LR UK don't know. But my brother has the
original papers somewhere, only problem is he's in the UK right now. Ah
well. :-)

&gt;BTW, any part from Lucas has a good chance of becoming an &quot;immobiliser&quot;,
&gt;usually fairly soon after it's installed. Over here, Lucas is referred to
&gt;as the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;.   :^)

Yup, that's the point. This LR is a chassis, firewall and axles under the
washing line, an engine and gearbox in the garage, body panel's in my
brother's semi-SO's garage, no wiring to speak of. But the spirit of Lucas
is in there somewhere :-)

Keep us updated on that vibration.

Wouter

remains a thing apart, unique unto itself. Most of us make life's journeys
without understanding that the journeying is a separate thing.&quot; -- Bob Hoover
