Subject: Bike Racks
Date: 19 Sep 95 20:10EDT

Related to the recent survey on bike racks, I'm wondering if
anyone is or has used a rack on the FRONT of their vans--more
specifically, on the front of one of the newer vanagons with
the black front bumper w/molded plastic valence underneath.

I've got an 89 Westy with such a bumper, and it occurred
to me that this might be the optimal placement for a bike rack
for a number of reasons: (1) the roof is just too darn high
for me to be climbing up there all the time, (2) a rack on the
back of the van means that the bike gets incredibly dusty on
dirt roads, and (3) you still have to take the bike and rack off
the van in order to get into back.  I'm lucky enough to have the
screens that go on the back hatch, front windows, and sliding door,
so if the skys look clear, I leave everything open at nite (summer)

I know the bikes would take a lot of bugs if on the front end
of the bus, but thats nothing compared to the dust and inconv.
of sticking them on the back.  So does anyone have something on
the front of their vans?  I've seen one on the front of an
82, but the rack was bolted to the front bumper and straped
to the roof rack.  I can't do this because of the valence panel
below the front bumper.  Any suggestions?

thanks
