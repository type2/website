Subject: '71 distrib. driveshaft install. quest.
Date: Sat, 9 Sep 1995 00:48:36 -0400 (EDT)

Hi y'all,

'71 1600dp

Tonight I got the heads, rocker arms assembled, adjusted the valves, and 
put the distributor driveshaft down into the hole per Idiot's guide 
instructions.  The engine was at TDC for the #1 cylinder, and I oriented 
the shaft such that the slot would be parallel to the rear of the engine 
(perpindic. to the crankcase seam) like the sketch shows, narrow side 
toward the rear. It popped down in there and rotated with the engine 
when I turned the pulley.

HOWEVER:  It was not _EXACTLY_ parallel to the rear like the sketch 
showed, but was parallel at about 18 degrees before TDC...not really that 
much.  Should I be concerned?  What is happening here?  I pulled it back 
out and tried again, but it goes to that same position.  Insights would 
be greatly appreciated!  I'm waiting for an answer before I proceed, so a 
quick answer would be great.
