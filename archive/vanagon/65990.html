Please add my name ARK &quot;THE HEATERMAN&quot; MIRVIS to the list.

The nickname &quot;THE HEATERMAN&quot; came from a club fellow, who found out
about my gasoline heater training and experience streching for over 30
years. This experience benefited folks who were freezing for many years
before. I can be of help, particularly at this time of the year for
owners of air or watercooled Vanagons.

I can be contacted (201)398-6363 (New Jersey). Leave the message.

Ark Mirvis  &quot;THE HEATERMAN&quot;
