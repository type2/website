Subject: WTB: Vanagon Westfalia

Although I haven't completely given up on buying a local '86 Westy that 
I have been looking at, I would like to see what else is out there.

I'm looking for a Westy Vanagon in excellent condition, or one with some 
well defined problem that is otherwise in excellent condition.  I would 
like an '86 or newer (2.1 l engine), but would consider older if the 
condition and price are right.  My only firm requirements are:

- Full Westy camper
- A/C
- Located a reasonable distance from Raleigh, NC (a day's drive or so 
max)
- Gasoline engine

Bill
