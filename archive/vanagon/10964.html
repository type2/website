Subject:       ANOTHER coolant bleeder scheme

I just did this yesterday and I like it-- alot.  Even better than the 
breast-pump idea :)

Take a generic windshield washer pump from Kmart, one with hose
barbs for the in/out.  Hook a section of tubing from the 'out'
nipple and put it on the barb on the pressure cap.  There is a
one-way valve on the cap that allows flow of coolant INTO the
reservoir but not OUT until 16 psi is reached.  Hook another section
of tubing on the 'in' side of the pump and stick that in a jug of anti-freeze. 
12V is readily available at the big wire on the alternator.  Follow
the coolant bleeding procedure pretty much by the book except now
you can leave the engine off (after running the engine to collect
air at the normal high spots) and pressurize the cooling system with
a continual supply of antifreeze!  Bleeding works like magic!!

One caution.  Those pumps, I believe, can develop high pressure (tho 
low volume so one has quite a bit of time to work with) so don't 
leave it running while you go for a smoke.  Use your noodle.

On a sadder note:
Due to the high volume of (albiet wonderful) mail, I am switching to 
digest mode  :(   I just don't have the discipline to stick all the 
mail in a &quot;folder&quot; during the day and read it when the work-day is 
done.  Reading it during the day was getting to be an addictive 
affair.  If I post something particularly brilliant that you need 
more info on RIGHT away, email me direct... I don't see THAT 
happening too often!  Anyway, so long and thanks for all the fish.
