Subject: I'm Stuck!

How DO you do it?

You keep popping in my head, no matter the situation, location, etc.  Cut 
it out, will you?  I find myself regularly looking like the cat who 
swallowed the ol' mouse!

Thanks for resending my message - did I really say that I sat back and 
pondered all the men in a daze as I am a she-goddess?  My dear boy, (oops - 
sorry) My dear man, I think you threw that in there as a joke.  I would 
NEVER sit back and say that about myself.  Pretty cheezy.  If, in fact, it 
DID come from my fingers (really, I know I didn't say that - TOTALLY NOT my 
style!), I apologize for the horrible way that sounded.   And, after all 
this, it was the message I sent you before the one you returned to me that 
had me wondering - I really was shocked at your response to it, which is 
why I wanted to re-read it. . .anyway, we've gone way past that issue so I 
guess it's time to drop it. . .

Groovy - I would be thrilled to have you here.  Really, YOUR schedule, ok?  
I am completely available!

Back to what I opened this with - as I stood at the sink in a towel this 
morning, struggling with the dishes (I ended up leaving them!), I half 
expected to turn around and see you in the doorway.  Wild deja vu!

I can't possibly reveal my extremely cool AOL trolling name.  Suffice it to 
say, you would be really proud of me, and shocked at the responses it's 
brought me.  It's a great hook.  I can just sit there doing nothing and I 
get pounced on by the AOL wierdos.  It's funny.  I have noticed a change in 
the overall &quot;mood&quot; or &quot;atmosphere&quot; or &quot;personality&quot; of AOL - when I first 
signed on, it was fun, exciting, a little mysterious - everyone was very 
respectful.  But now it seems there is this huge paranoid thing - people 
are so concerned with their anonynimity that they are paranoid to 
cyber-talk with total strangers (I must admit, I got a little paranoid from 
one person too - he really freaked me out and though he told me he was in 
Tennessee, I could swear he was someone I knew here.  Ha!  I ended up 
signing off.  Then I laughed at myself &quot;LOL&quot; for being such a dork).  I am 
thrilled to be your teacher.  I can hardly wait.  Watch out though - I WILL 
troll the cyberworld and pounce on you when you least expect it.  You will 
love it. Guaranteed.

Well I still can't get over your interest in wooing me on my birthday.  For 
the zillionth time, I will tell you you are incredible, wonderful, amazing 
(go on, Christen. . . ) - and I realized another reason why I think so - 
because you are able to make me feel so good about myself.  YOU, my 
darling, are the one who rocks.  Thank you.

I loved the giant &quot;CABO&quot; thing - you have a program that does that, right?  
I can't imagine you doing that in your spare time!  You wooed me with a 
giant &quot;Bella&quot; like that once - I loved it.  So I'm sorry you had to deal 
with my bitching about Cabo.  I do know how to do the bratty thing,eh?  ;)  
Actually, I was more concerned with being totally clueless and flying into 
Mexico alone (dumb American tourista) with boxes full of meeting stuff on 
top of my own - the Mexicans know a good prey when they see one - I 
remember the Mexican cab drivers and airport staff scaring me even when I 
had my dad's arm around me and my bro' on the other side.  I'm also playing 
up that concern a little so I don't lose that full day of beach time (I 
need to be tan for this friend of mine who is coming up to see me for my 
birthday - my ghostly pale skin would frighten him away right now).  BIG 
brat.  Ha!  

I asked my dad about the MG stuff again - he said he was looking into this 
huge MG parts/info catalog.  He threw it away by mistake, but is trying to 
locate one again through his crew chief dude (total dork).  Hey - he got a 
2nd place last Sat. in Pococno, PA, and a 5th on Sun (he would have gone 
for it on Sun, he said, but it was pouring rain and he has trashed the car 
every time he's raced there, so he decided to take it easy).  Cool.  My 
poor mom was alone on Mom's Day!  Did I tell you the funny &quot;little brother&quot; 
story about Mom's day?  The sunday BEFORE mom's day, my bro' and I were 
e-mailing on AOL and he wanted to be sure I had sent something to her for 
Mom's day.  I said not yet, it's not 'till NEXT sunday. . . his reply, 
&quot;Glad you told me, I was going to bring a card and flowers over for dinner. 
 I'll just wait till next week. . . Awww shit, Chris!  These flowers will 
be dead by then!&quot;  So I told him to bring them to her anyway.  Cute, eh?  
That ol' Pocock charm. . . 

Yippee - I really am psyched to give you the AOL tour!

Have a supremely groovy day. .  hope you get some sun down there today!

Christen
