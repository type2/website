&gt; &gt;        Ok, who's gonna run out and put a Cummins in their bus? Steve?
&gt; &gt;Anyone??
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Size-wise, I believe a bus fits better inside a Cummins Diesel.  :^)
&gt; 
You may be right... My father-in-law has an MCI bus with a Detroit 
Diesel in it. The thing makes a ChevyV8 look like a lawnmower, and 
his is only a V6!! (some 8 or 9 litres, but still only a V6). And it 
gets 10 mpg on the highway....
