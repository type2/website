From: ygardner_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Yvonne Gardner)

Does anyone know where i can get a under the dashboard cover for the
steering column, for a VW Vanagon Syncro 87.  I've tried to get it from the
factory but came out empty handed.  I live in CT so if ya could I'd sure
appreciate it. 
 
P.S. If you know of any real cool VW sites or ones which can help me find a
calalog that I don't have to pay for send them to me at my Email address.
