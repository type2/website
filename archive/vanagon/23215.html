Subject: Isn't that 5', 33&quot;?

	Folks,
	People have been insulting the persons, music and fans of
various composers and performers for a whole long time. Don't like
John Cage/Grateful Dead/Phish/Tammy Wynette/etc? Don't listen to 'em!
But I'm confused- the famous Cage piece where you *don't* play the
piano for a fixed amount of time is &gt;5'33&quot;&lt; by my recollection- was
there a 45 rpm version that played in 4'33&quot; that everyone but me
knows about? 

	VW content: The music that many of us enjoy as we drive our
vehicles, or ride on the Seattle-Bremerton ferryboat, or listen
to the night-sounds at a primitive BLM campsite, is a collection
of random rhythms which our minds give form and shape to. Cage tells
a great story about watching people swimming through a glass wall in
a swimming pool of some kind, and hearing music and seeing a relationship
between the music and the swimmer's movements. And then discovering
that the swimmers couldn't hear the music!

	Somewhere there is a border between beauty and art, between
something that simply *is* and something that represents an attempt 
to communicate. For some of us, its boring. For some, that's where God is. 
Some think the whole world is God's communication with us. There is a
rhythm to nature- to dust on a window or clouds over Kansas on a spring day.
For me, the sound of my family's 68 Bus being downshifted is as much
the music of childhood as James Brown or Vaughn-Williams.
