&gt;providing their services free of charge.  The truth of the matter is *SOMEONE* 
&gt;has to pay for the runing of the lists, and that someone is not you or I.  The 
&gt;University of Minnesota allows Gerry to run the V_at_L list.  Ken has to pay for 
&gt;running the Type2 list.

not off this list anyhow :)

&gt;&gt;Gee, weren't we lucky that Gerry didn't have any 'plans' for vanagon_at_lenti!
&gt;Tim, whether you like it or not, there are people out there who profit from
&gt;VW's.  

no sh*t?

So I guess the next time you drop into Tom Fitzpatricks barndoor page you'll
send him a few bucks, same for Tom Forhans page, same for Jim Clarks tent
page. Sorry for the pages I've omitted folks.  Some of us do things out of
kindness and enthusiasm and share freely.  I didn't propose putting an
access charge on the 'Digital Bentley' concept did I?? yet that's going to
take some effort and I'm not whining about 'recovering my costs' nor are
those who offered to help out. Jesus H., if that's life to you, nickles and
dimes, then keep it!  And send me $10 to defray the cost of the computer I'm
typing this on since I only bought it to send messages to V_at_L because I
don't do anything else with it at all, yeah right.  Good night.  tim
