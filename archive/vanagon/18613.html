Yo kids,
got a little bored and decided to let the web worm do a search on
'Volkswagen'...one of the results (and there were several) was the
Geneva auto-show at
   http://www.infodesign.ch/AutoShow/Premieres/VW.F.html
with a picture of the new Ford/VW van (minivan? this thing is small!).
An added bonus for the fracophones amongst us: it's in French.  For the
English translation, use
   http://www.infodesign.ch/AutoShow/Premieres/VW.E.html

And there's more:

I left off some of the ones we know about from regular list postings.
This should keep you busy for a while...

Joachim
