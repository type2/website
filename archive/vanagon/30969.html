Dittos, Bob.

I think I am the luckiest air-cooled VW pilot around.  My wife has tolerated
my converting our entire fleet to air-cooled VWs and even encourages me
when I mention adopting others.

In our little collection, we have two daily driven Buses and only one Bug.
I have been hankering to add another Bug, but did't know why until Bob
enlightened us with his VW knowledge.

I'll let y'all know when I find the next Bug.

Richard
