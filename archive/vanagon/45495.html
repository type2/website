Subject: Re: Starter repair:replace wire to solenoid

I had problems with my starter solenoid.
My fix was to wire a second starter switch on the dashboard. So you can run a
second wire in parrallel. THis means that you have to hav e  atoggle switch
on the dashboard. On the left had side of the steering whell there already is
a hole in the sheet metal just just have to drill though the padding.
