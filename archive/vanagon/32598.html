Subject: re:ROUND GIZMO TO LEFT OF HEATER CONTROL

Weston wrote something about the silver socket, which I wont repeat
because he can't seem to turn the caps lock OFF.

It is a secret!!! ;-). Only those who do not keep their caps lock OFF at
all times while writing messages on the 'net are not allowed to know
about it.  Seriously though, it is considered yelling if you type in
caps.

For your edification it is a 12 volt socket. You can find items for this
mainly in Europe, but if I'm not mistaken there are some companies that
sell items for it in the US.

Cheers,

David
