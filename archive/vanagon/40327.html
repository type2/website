Subject: 2nd call for '79 parts 

Again I say that I am about to strip &amp; ship a bunch of good (OK, useable)
parts from a '79 that is about to be cubed.

The list so far:

PWIES_at_LOYOLA.EDU - Sliding door mechanism
                   '79 exhaust (maybe)

Rodney L. Boleyn - Cargo Door glass

Sami Dakhlia -     Dimmer relay
                   flasher relay
                   clutch and pressure plate
                   First call on dash knobs

Brian Verbeek -    Headliner pole end gaskets

Brian M. Miller -  EGR Valve off engine

Still to be claimed is the rest of the FI geat, the ('79) heater boxes, a
good (stained) grey center seat, a complete (all the bits are there) AC
system, a second set of sliding door parts, a rebuildable 2L block, both
(brown) front seats, and the back seat (also brown) a decent back bumper, a
decent (beige) back upper lid w/heated glass, a rust free drivers door
(blue/white), and a rust-free cargo door (blue/white).  After this weekend,
offit goes to Toyota-land. (recycle city).  I am willing to remove and ship
smaller bits, but would request that things like the doors and engine block
be picked up.
