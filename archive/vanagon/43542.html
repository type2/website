Subject: radio in 67 westy..

Hi all,
 I was wondering if anyone has experience 
installing a stereo in a '67&quot;? nothing fancy am/fm 
and cassette.. now for the tricky part...
I have what appears to be the original speaker and
mount inside the dash, which I removed, and it 
seems to be a 5 in speaker..so.....
does anyone know of a stereo and speaker that will
fit &quot;without&quot;  major modifications?

TIA
Tim Mckane '67 westy (jane)
