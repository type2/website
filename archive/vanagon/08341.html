&gt;only if you get five more buses. :)

I'll work on five more Internet people. We just got local access here in a
few of the rural towns of Siskiyou County.  To find five more busses with
Internet access will be a long term goal.  But I accept the offer.  My
concern is, by the time that I bring five more people on-line, that the
volume will be to much for me to handle.

How about CA.MTN  for all those who take great joy in living in the
mountains and still drive their _powervagons_?
