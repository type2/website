&gt;Pull out dipstick.  Oil to TOP of dipstick.  Odd.  Well, let's clean
&gt;it off, and check for real.  Back in and out.  OIL AT TOP OF DIPSTICK!

Any chance your fuel pump has developed a hole in its diaphragm,
and is draining gasoline into the engine oil? I've seen this happen
on both VWs and Fords.
