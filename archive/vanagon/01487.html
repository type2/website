Subject: Re: hydraulic valve lifters?

OK sounds good in theory, but what is &quot;adequate&quot; pressure to keep the 
lifters fully functioning at speed and idle? - 10 psi?, 45 psi? Is higher 
pressure better and if so why not take efforts to increase it, ie. by 
installing better pumps, oil cooling systems  etc? DC 


By the way no one has given me the definitive answer as to whether 
synthetics are appropriate for air-cooled engines. I have heard pro and 
con. What's the scoop?

&gt; This is what I believe about hydraulic lifters.
&gt; 
&gt; They provide some cushioning effect to reduce impact and wear on rockers, lifters
&gt; and valve tips. Tappet clearance is totally eliminated. The hydraulic lifter also
&gt; self adjusts. The engine will run quieter and the valve train will last longer.
&gt; It eliminates the need of valve adjustment. Valve opening and closing is more
&gt; accurate. Engine performance is always at the best.
&gt; 
&gt; It works like a pump. when it is fully pumped up it will work almost like a solid
&gt; lifter. It will firmly press against the valve tip but not firm enough to push
&gt; the valve off its seat, which would cause the valve to overheat and warp.
&gt; 
&gt; However, if the car has been sitting around for too long (sometimes could be just
&gt; a few days or even in one day) the lifetr might collapse. When the engine is
&gt; stationary half of the valves are compressed and partially opened. This causes
&gt; the compressed oil inside the lifter to leak out. Cars with a lot of miles tend
&gt; to have worn lifters and will leak faster.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not a problem though. Once the engine is started oil will be pumped
&gt; back into the lifter again. It might take up to 30 minutes to fully recharge
&gt; all lifters. Do not drive the car if lifters are still clicking loud. the noise
&gt; will go away eventually. Replace dirty engine oil with fresh one if it takes a
&gt; long time to recharge the lifters. Once the noice is gone take a 5 minute driv
&gt; to fully recharge the lifters.
&gt; 
&gt; Lifters can go bad if they do wear out and can no longer withhold preasure.
&gt; This seldom happens really. Kepp enging oil clean is the key to keep them alive.
