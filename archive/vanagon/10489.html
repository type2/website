&gt;  I do have a couple of Q's for the list since I am a virgin at working on 
&gt; the fuel injection system in these buses.
&gt; 
&gt;  1) What is the best book to get to find out how to work on the FI?

Already answered by others better than I could.  I have never gotten past 
&quot;Bentley&quot;.

&gt; 
&gt;  2) Is the fuel pump supposed to start working when the ignition is 
&gt;     turned on or just after the engine has been turned over?

The fuel pump works from key on to key off, *but* it gets power from
different places depending on whether you are running (key in &quot;on&quot; 
position) or starting (key in start position).  This changover is
accomplished by the &quot;double relay&quot; mounted on the left side of the plate
separating the fuel tank from the engine compartment.  I &quot;tested&quot; mine by
disconnecting the starter(at the motor), crawling under the car, and
having a friend do the switch while i held the pump (a cylinder over the
left rear wheel). 

&gt; 
&gt;  3) Should I scrap the FI and get a carb (or two)?

I recommend against it very strongly I have put 80K trouble free miles on 
my '78 with nary an FI problem.  Once working these are as bulletproof as 
any VW system (don't ask about my starter problems{grrr}).  Of course, YMMV!

&gt; 
&gt;  Well this is most of it for now, I need to get this bus on the road.  My 
&gt; friends are starting to think they will be driving me around forever.  I 
&gt; have a '73 Camper that I have been tinkering with forever. I plan on 
&gt; putting in all the Westy camper stuff that came out of my dad's '73. (Yes 
&gt; he has one too.  Everyone in my family has a bus or a split.) He took it 
&gt; all out because he didn't want to &quot;carry around all that weight.&quot;

Any Westy-stuff you don't want.... don't throw it away.  I am in DC and 
looking ....

&gt; 
&gt;  I enjoy reading all that goes on on the VANAGON list, even though my 
&gt; wife thinks I waste too much time at the computer


This, I think, comes under &quot;Nothing is more boring than watching someone 
use a computer&quot;
