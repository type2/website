Hey now,
        I guess I might as well say hi also. I'm Eddie. I'm a voice major
at UT Austin, transferred from Los Angeles last year. Can't wait to go back
to No. Cal.  Grew up in San Diego, was in LA for 4 yrs, will settle
somewhere north of Marin.
        I got my '70 Transporter from an impound yard, $150 with the #3 rod
thrown through the case. Had a badly rusted '69 Ghia at the time, with a
new engine &amp; tranny. Pulled the engine and some other parts, sold the Ghia
for $100 to a friend (he wanted to resto). Been driving the bus as a daily
driver for about 2 years now, including the move to Texas. Eventually I
want a '67 or earlier, but my '70 is cool for now. The PO was in an
accident, the big panel behind the driver has a 1.5 foot gash in it. The
PO-or some moron-didn't even pound it out, just threw on a ton of bondo and
primered the whole thing. Therefore, I don't think I'll ever do a full
restore on this one-just keep it in decent mechanical shape.
        If you couldn't tell from my previous post, I'm also a Deadhead-and
very sad that the rumors of an Austin show did not come to pass with Jerry.
He was always the one that got the most feeling out of me at shows. Dancin'
to Estimated is cool, but there was nothing quite like a heartfelt Morning
Dew or He's Gone. An interesting side note-I understand that Jerry didn't
want to play Stephen because he had &quot;bad vibes&quot; about the song. Jerry's
funeral was at St. Stephen Episcopal. Coincidence? Premonition?

        My # is 512-416-7980 if anyone finds themselves in need of help in
the Austin area. How about some one compiling all the phone #'s given and
making a list of Vanagon contacts for those road trips gone bad? Or local
flavor, for that matter? Just my $.02... BTW, I'm looking for a sunroof or
ragtop Ghia in the Austin or surrounding areas (Houston, San Antone,
Dallas). Needs to be around the $1k area, and restorable. With or without
engine. If anyone knows from whence it may come, kindly send thy message.
Thanks for all your help and advice-I do appreciate.

Peace,
