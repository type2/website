Subject: Re: Valve Propane Tank

&gt; OK.... I have to have at least a new fill valve on my '85 camper.  Is 
&gt; this a part that is available at any gas bottle supplier or is it one of 
&gt; those dreaded OEM things?  Is there a source for new tanks that is not 
&gt; VW? If so, does anyone know how much? I have 1-1/2 weeks to put this 
&gt; thing together before we leave.  Anything I order from the west coast 
&gt; will take at least 8 days. Appreciate your suggestions.

I called the local RV place 6 months ago to check on this, and they 
quoted me ~$450 cdn for a new tank including valve/reg. Turns out 
mine is fine - I just repainted the tank &amp; re-sealed the reg joints. 
I think the dealer is the last place to look, since the tank was 
not added by VW.
