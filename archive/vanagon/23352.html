Subject: Propane

Those of you who know me know that I am a safety nut. But let's keep this 
propane danger in perspective.

--Propane actually has _less_ energy per gallon than gasoline. Yes, it 
can cause a horrible accident, but so can gasoline, natural gas, or 
cooking grease.
--Like gasoline, propane fumes are heavier than air, and will collect in 
low places.
--All approved propane devices have automatic safety devices to cut off 
gas in a flame out.
--Risk assesment is a very personal thing. But, with almost all of the 20 
million RVs on the road travelling with their gas on (for hot water, 
fridge) how many accidents have been made worse by propane on. IMO, if 
this risk were significant, 2-way fridges would not be made, and the gas 
would automatically by shut off when travelling. The RVIA code is very 
strict, but does not prevent propane while traveling.

That said, everyone should make their own judgement of risk vs. benefit.
