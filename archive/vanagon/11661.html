Subject: Re: more tidbits,(f) Fiat 850

&gt;I test drove a Fiat 600 &quot;sedan&quot; years ago. It was a used one for sale in

My mother had one when my brother and sisters, and I, were infants and toddlers.
I remember one time when we were speeding down the freeway, and I think it
was then that I established a relationship between how fast we were going,
and what that dial in front of my mother meant.  The red pointer was all
the way over to the right, which would place our speed at about 80 mph.
