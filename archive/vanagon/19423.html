Subject: Broken Vanagon slider handles

My wife and I just decided to add to our VW &quot;collection&quot;.  We are looking
for a reasonably late model passenger Vanagon.  We are noticing (as we did
when we started looking for our camper bus) that the majority of Vanagons
have broken slider door handles (the outside one).  Can anybody tell me why?
I'm sure we're not imagining this, I'm talking about over 50% here.  How
much do they cost?
Any hints on mechanical things I should look for?  I've been following this
list for a few weeks, and have seen talk of bad head gaskets.
Does anybody have A/C?
Is the Vanagon a good road tripping vehicle?
