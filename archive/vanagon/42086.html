Subject: Sweating W/O Air conditioning

I am going to put an extra window unit where the stove is.  The smallest
window A/C unit I could find was 5000 BTU.  Does any one know if a smaller
unit is manufactured and if anyone has ever done this to a Westfalia?  
I wonder if it is possible to convert my factory air to run on the 110v
so I wouldnt have to get an extra A/C unit at all.  With the heat and humidity
in FL it feels like 120 degrees, even at nighttime.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks a lot.
