Subject: Re: '56 kombi - transmission:...

bus boys my be a reputable company but through my experience I still have not
received a catalogue which was ordered 7 months ago. Sorry to bitch on my
first posting but every dealing with a west coast company or club(i.e.
S.O.T.O) has resulted in problems. Since joining SOTO I have received 5
newsletters in a year and never received some t-shirts i ordered over a year
ago . SOTO is supposed to be the leading club club on type II;'s but I have
found NEATO a lot more responsive and informative.I have tried to talk to
David Heard but he has not responded. If you have any comments please poste
them.
