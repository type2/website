Subject: Parting out Syncro :-)
Date: Fri, 16 May 1997 17:56:58 -0400

To all,

	Here's the scoop... 87' Syncro Vanagon, 120k, no engine, slight front end
damage (about 5mph collision to drivers corner), small crack in windshield.
Everything else is there and appears in order and good shape. The center
driveshaft looks in excellent shape and probably is not the orginal. Over
all the van looks like it had been pretty well cared for. It hasn't been
parked long and the engine was removed because it needed a desperate
rebuild. Instead of reinstalling, the owner put the engine in something
else???.

	Here's my deilema, I am going to buy this creature and strip it down. It
is actually a good resto candidate, but I just don't have that kind of
money right now. Unfortunately, the owner wants a pretty penny for the van
and I'm looking for someone who needs a hard to find part or two. 
Personally, I don't really need any of the parts, but I want to sell my
syncro sometime soon and would like to have some good replacement parts to
add along with the deal to sweeten things so-to-speak. 

	So If any of you non-syncro owners want to add a second gas tank, or any
of you syncroites want to store some more parts in your attics, get back
with me soon. I'm going to act on this thing soon and don't want to totally
drain my bank account :-)
