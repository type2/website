Subject: Re: Syncro Handling/Sway Bars

I feel that my syncro handles great on or off road!  Mine already has a 1 
inch sway bar on the front, and the springs/shocks combo makes the ride 
very firm and controlled!  one of my favorite moves is to get some joker 
in a fast car behind me on a wet cloverleaf-type on ramp and sandbag it 
until the joker is right behind me.  After i floor it I usually dont see 
them again.  

ps I have michelins ( i forget which, too many cars) and they seem just fine
