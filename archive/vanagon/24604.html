Yep.  I managed to lock up the driver's side wheel on my '72
bus.  It started pulling left, I figured the calipers weren't
releasing all the way (which maybe was also happening, come to
think of it), but it was the bearings slowly seizing up.  Within
10 miles, it was pulling too hard to keep steering straight.  I
can't remember if the stub axle had actually twisted off or if
it was just a scorched mess, but it was definitely seized up
when everything cooled off.  I bought a used stub axle in good
condition for $25, installed that with new bearings, etc., 40K
miles ago, and haven't had any problems since.  (I'm better
about keeping things greased, though...)
