Subject:      Re: Yokohama Y370 vs. Y356

&gt;        - tread pattern
&gt;        - the Y370 is a non-reinforced sidewall 8-ply
&gt;        - the Y356 is a reinforced sidewall, comes in 6- or 8-ply
&gt;
&gt;        Anyone out there using a Y356? Please respond with your
&gt;        comments and I will add those to the Y370 and Michelin rants
&gt;        and raves.

The Y356 is/was available in both 6 and 8 ply C and D raters, for
quite some time it was the budget leader tire in 185R14 for the vans,
I think about $40 and $50 respectively from Tire Rack for years,
but it is a TERRIBLE tire.  It is a highway rib tread design, ie
looks like a Mack truck tire, it has no sipes running perpendicular
to the tread to channel out water, sort of like a 70's bias ply tread
design.  Unless you live in the desert, largely to be avoided, but it
is an exceptionaly smooth running long lasting tire for the reasons
that make it horrendous in the wet.
