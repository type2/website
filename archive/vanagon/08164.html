&gt; stay now and just delete the stuff I post- that ought to cut the list

thanks for your thoughts, bill.

but as far as deleteing any messages from the list, well a good analogy 
might be thinking of the list as being like a realy good batch of herbal 
bread. since violet and i both bake, we both like to try out a special 
batch of herbal bread once in a while.

the list is like this in that herbal bread is made up of many 
ingrediants.

the main ingredients for bread are flour, water, and yeast.

for the list it would be our vw busses, and what we have to do TO them 
and what we like to do WITH them.

now what it is that makes herbal bread different than regular bread is 
the fact that you add selected herbs and spices to the basic bread mixture.

and for this mailing list the herbs and spices are the secondary comments 
and completely off topic discussions that go on in the group.

as anyone that has tried make herb bread knows, it is easy to make a 
batch of herb bread that is almost, or even completely inedable by useing 
herbs and spices that SEEMED like they would go well together.

yet on the other hand some combinations that come about by accident, or
&quot;wild eyed caution to the wind experimenting&quot; with things that would seem
to have nothing to do with makeing a good herb bread, turn out to be the
finest things you have ever tasted. (and usualy you wish you could
remember just WHAT you put in it so you could repeat the performance). 

and so i think of this mailing list as being like a realy fine batch of 
herb bread. and to change any aspect of it would alter it to something 
else completely.

and so i will be thinking of the list once in a while. and thinking of 
this list will be like the smell of bakeing bread, something i find very 
pleasent.

and, like the smell of freshly baked bread means that there is something 
very pleasent nearby, and available. the thoughts about this list will be 
pleasent, and reminde me that it is nearby, and available.

thanks to you, bill, and thanks to everyone else for makeing what would 
have to be an award winning batch of herbal bread that can be enjoyed by all.
