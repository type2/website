Subject: Re: more '89 saga (A/C)

&gt;Well, they didn't replace the *entire* A/C system. New switches, new
&gt;compressor, new in-line 3A fuse for the compressor clutch.

A call from our buddy at the dealer says that the fuse should be a 10 or 12
amp (I don't know how or why it could be both).  I'll try a 10 first
(although the 3 that I put in has survived so far).  BIG amp spikes?  Seems
odd...
