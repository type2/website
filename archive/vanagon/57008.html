Subject: Shaky Front End


I've got a '80 Vanagon L Camper and yesturday and today I have felt a 
wobble or shaking from the front end.  It almost feels like the one of 
the tires is wobbling.  I stopped driving it in fear that I'd do damage.  
Though now I don't know if it's smart to just drop it off somewhere and 
say &quot;let me know what's wrong&quot;, or if I can do it myself.  I get so 
uneasy going to auto places.  Kind of like hiring a lawer, or finding a 
doctor.  I guess I value both my money and my bus a lot.  

Any suggestions on what the wobble may be would help me pinpoint it 
before I take it somewhere.  

Thanks,

Kyle
