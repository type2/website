Subject: Re: VWs in Hollywood [was VW sighting (Field of Dreams)]


&gt; 
&gt; &gt;        Sorry if this is basic information, I just saw Fiel 
&gt; I have been making notes in my sketchbook (I often sketch when I watch TV
&gt; or whatever) whenever I see VWs in movies...
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what I've seen so far...
&gt; (This list isn't as cool as I'd like it to be, but who has time for this
&gt; stuff... ;]  )
&gt; 
&gt; *** Lots of screen time:
&gt; Tapeheads--the main characters drive around in a Thing
&gt; 
&gt; Slackers--one of the charatcters takes some girls to a gig in his white bus
&gt; 
&gt; Fried Green Tomatos--what's her face rear-ends a red bug convertable
&gt; belonging to two young females
&gt; 
&gt; *** VW Sightings in movies (quick peeks...)
&gt; Broco Billy-- bug on the road after scene &quot;may I touch your breast...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Chuck Norris Film (title unknown) -- Chase scene, many Westfalias and a bug
&gt; are featured in one chase seen, sumo wrestler type bad guy picks up bug
&gt; (literaly) and threatens driver
&gt; 
&gt; Breaking Away--used car lot has two bugs for sale
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. No--bug in parking lot at start of film
&gt; 
&gt; Live and Let Die-- Bug on street in New Orleans funeral scene.
&gt; 
&gt; Bikini Car Wash (USA up all night movie...I love bad films...)--Cal type
&gt; bus gets hosed down by a couple of bimbos.
&gt; 
&gt; That's all I have for now.  If you ever see an aircooled in a movie, even
&gt; just for a second, please let me know....



&quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; -one of the high school Surf dudes drives 
a splittie...

....Uh....&quot;Herbie&quot;.... or is that too obvious

There was some movie about a gang in L.A. &quot;Las Ondas&quot;, a gang member's 
brother drove a splittie...
