Hello all,

	Excuse me for being a little uninformed. Can someone tell me what a &quot;Syncro&quot; and 
&quot;Westfalia&quot; are? Also, did all years come in a camper? When did the original &quot;Bus&quot; halt production? 
Is the &quot;Vanagon&quot; an improvement over the bus that you wouldn't consider owning a bus? I am just 
atarting to look for a VW van of some kind but I don't know what I want or whats good to buy etc. I 
would appreciate it for any input on these questions.
