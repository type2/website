Subject: Embarassing moments/My rear wheel ...

  At lunch yesterday I was stopped at a traffic signal.  Just as the traffic
light changed, a wheel rolled through the intersection at about 5mph.  Everyone 
around was dumbstruck. This is the kind of thing you see just before the caution 
flag is waved at a racetrack.
  As I drove through the intersection I noticed the source of the rolling wheel.
A '71 VW beetle with the top down and resting on the left rear brake drum.  The
driver was either hanging his head down or tuning the radio.  Forgot the lugnuts.
  This was just after reading the vanagon.digest and the two threads about &quot;My 
rear wheel  ...&quot; and &quot;Embarassing moments&quot;.     :-)

Jack  '73 Westy            Is it Friday yet?
