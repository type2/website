Subject: Sway bars VS camber compensators



I'd like to try out either a sway bar or a camber compensator on my
'66 bus.  Handling is already reasonably good due to a ball jointed 
'68 front beam but I'd like to get the back end under control in crosswinds.

I know what a sway bar is, but what is a camber compensator?  Is it different 
from a sway bar?  Are either of these likely to help the crosswind situation
on a swing axel bus?

Thanks,
...Markus
