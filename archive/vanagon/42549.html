&gt;I recently put in an external oil cooler and replaced a piece of missing

&gt;running around 160-190. Are these too cool? I am running 20w50 for oil. 
&gt;Should I try 10-40 or 10-30 to get the temps back up? Or should I be 
&gt;happy that the temps are so low. I have heard that too cool oil temps are 
&gt;hard on the engine.

This is the ideal temp range for the air cooled motors.  Almost impossible to
achieve with type 4 types.  The sticker on your engine usually calls for
range of 138 to 168,(ha-ha).

Don't worry, be very very happy.
