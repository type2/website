Subject: Re: Vanagon A/C 

I have a number for reference purposes as my 90 A/C has just been repaired
and recharged with a new compressor to boot.

In the sun, and when it is 90 degrees outside, the A/C duct shows a
temperature at the outlet of 34 degrees F. 

If your late model Vanagon A/C cannot achieve at least 39 degrees in the
same conditions, then it isn't operating at its peak, and might need a
recharge, a new receiver drier, or other work. 49 degrees in the same
conditions is the absolute hottest you should tolerate. 

I have been measuring my A/C ducts for years so I have a good handle on this
one.

These temperatures are for when you are driving on a highway. It is possible
that in stop and go traffic the numbers will go higher, but the Van should
never get uncomfortably warm. My van used to get uncomfortably warm in stop
and go driving around the city, but I now know that the A/C system wasn't
working right then cause it always stays cool now. I thought the system just
couldn't keep up.

If you have A/C and it seems marginal, then this post is just to let you
know there is hope out there if you would have the system attended to.
