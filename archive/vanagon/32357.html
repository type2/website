I dunno.  Sounds like the idea I has when I was a kid:  Why not hook a 
generator to a motor, and run the wires from the motor back to the
generator...  Start it up, and it should run forever...

Maybe you could put a flywheel on the blower fan, and then you could get
some momentum built up from the carb sucking air thru it, then turn the
blower off and it would run by itself for a while!

Or maybe...
