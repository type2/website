Subject: Timing puzzle


    Hi all,
        
            There's been a lot of mail from people with timing 
problems recently. Well here's another one. I have a 1971 bus, which 
at some point has had the engine replaced, I think from a 1600 
Beetle. The engine number is AD212000'ish. According to the Haynes 
manual the AD series engines prior to AD290000 are timed at 5o ATDC. 
However the pulley on the engine is the type with three notches which 
I think are TDC, 7.5o BTDC and 10o BTDC. Has anyone any idea what the 
engine should be timed at? The distributer is the type with the 
single vacuum connection. TIA

                                Cheers
                                        Jon
