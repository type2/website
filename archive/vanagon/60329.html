Subject: Anyone try Bosch Platinums in their EV?

	
It's time to change plugs in the EV...and I've used the stock 4 prong plugs the last time...but I want to try the Platinums this time around. I've used the Platinums in my other cars and have been impressed, but am unsure about putting them in the EV, considering the bizzare design of the factory plugs.

Anyone with an EV use them?? Comments?

Thanks.

Ric
