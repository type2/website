&gt;what the MultiVan version consisted of ?

My recollection (getting dimmer by the minute) is this:
The Vanagon Multivan was a model variation in 1990 &amp; 1991 model years and
consisted of an interior that had a table and rear-facing middle seats like
the 1987-1989 Wolfsburg editions.  Also it had a Westfalia pop top making it
kind of like a Camper w/o the camping stuff.
