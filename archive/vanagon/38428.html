Subject: Re: Sunroof Question: Part II


&gt;Could you get a Deluxe w/ a sunroof and no roof glass?
&gt;------
&gt;
&gt;no
&gt;
&gt;I suppose theoretically you could get a hard top deluxe ordered with a
&gt;sunroof, but there is no number for that body type, and i think it highly
&gt;unlikely.


Never say never. Just about everything was an option and even combinations
that are supposed to be impossible managed to sneak out of the factory.
BTW, while we're talking about wierd combinations, did you see the picture
of a '63 bus with a sliding door in V*lksw*rld a while ago. At least I think
it was a '63, it was definitely earlier than '67 when these were supposed to
be first available.
