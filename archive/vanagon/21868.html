Leaving out most of it.  Think about the economies of the various 
countries you named.  The Asian mainland countries had their economies 
destroyed by various wars throughout this century.  With bad economies 
the cost of labor is low.  In the '50s stuff from Japan was in the same 
category as the rest of Asia.  Now its economy is strong and is not in 
that category anymore.  With bad economies there isn't much chance for 
the local companies so the biggest employers will be foreign.  The 
biggest reason for a foreign company to build (or purchase from a local 
company) in one of these countries is to get lower cost of labor.  Those 
that are skimping on labor are probably skimping elsewhere as well thus 
the low quality isn't the fault of the individual Asians as much as of 
those 'hiring' them.  Its not jingoistic once you ponder about the real 
reason for apparent low quality.
