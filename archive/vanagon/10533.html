My brother saw a bus &quot;with a lot of windows along the top on its side&quot; 
along Hiway 101 yesterday--the same (unfortunate) accident?

&gt; Saw a news last night about a VW bus involved in a fatal head on accident.
&gt; The bus appeared to be of 70's. The accident happened on a Bay Area highway
&gt; in California.
&gt; 
&gt; The left front corner (driver side) was severly ruined. The driver door was
&gt; missing (probably torn by rescue workers to get the driver out). However, 
&gt; the driver's cab of the bus seemed remain intact. The bus was still on its
&gt; wheels. Have no idea how badly the driver was injured. But by looking at the 
&gt; damage I believe the driver should be OK with moderate injuries only.
&gt; 
&gt; Not so lucky with the other car though. If not mistaken what I saw on my TV
&gt; was a small Japanese car. The car was torn into pieces. The front axle with
&gt; engine was seperated from the rest. The passenger cabinet was totally exposed
&gt; and fractured. It's unbelievable... There were 2 fatalities reported.
&gt; 
&gt; It was an awful accident. Don't know which car was responsible. One thing for
&gt; sure is that VW buses are safe besides the the special taste driving in them.
