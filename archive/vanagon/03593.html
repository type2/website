Subject: Ball Joint Question

Wel, the front end of my 73 is lying in my basement in bits.  I got the
axle beam sandblasted and TIG welded and now I'm in the process of putting
it all back together.  I figured that while the torsion arms are lying
there on my bench would be a good time to lube the ball joints, but I see
they are the 'disposable 'kind, ie; no grease fittings. &quot;As far as I know&quot;
the ball joints are not in need of replacement, and seeing as how
replacements cost CAN$40 up each I'd rather not.  What's the net wisdom on
lubing ball joints - I thought of squeezing in some grease using a syringe.
