Subject: Re: bus racing

     &gt;&gt; &gt;  The other wonderful idea along these lines would be to
     &gt;&gt; &gt; find a drag strip and go on 'grudge' night- match-race vans, for 
     &gt;&gt; &gt; the slowest 1/4 miles they'd ever have recorded!
     &gt;&gt;
     &gt;There is a drag strip in Union Grove, Wis that will let anything 
     &gt;race.(as long as it passes inspection)  I have always wanted to race 
     &gt;my covertible.
     &gt;After I fix my the bus-movingandstopping-bits I think i will take my
     &gt;camper.
     
     Hey, I was at Santa-Pod raceway a couple of weekends back and I took 
     my '64 Deluxe on the strip. Stock 1600cc single port, and I got a 1/4 
     mile of 25 seconds with 47mph on the dial.
     
     cool,
     
     Lee.
