Subject: Re: Trip to South America


I'm cc:ing the reply to the vanagon list. I'm sure people on the list
have lots of advice on what VW bus to take to south america. There
was also a recent thread on going to tierra del fuego in year 2000,
including a discussion of the difficulties of passing the darien
gap with a vehicle.

Regarding diesel Westies:

   From: J Anderson &lt;spruce_at_m2.sprynet_dot_com&gt;

   If you don't mind me asking how much did you pay and in what condition,
   rust, miles, what worked, what didn't?  How is the hill power?  There is
   someone in Attleboro who has one, with 35k on a new engine, but he wants
   $6500 for an 82, which seems like alot.  The gaseater heater leaks, there
   are a few tears in the top, but supposedly no rust, original paint.

$6500 sounds expensive. &quot;blue book&quot; price in my '93 edition is $4500.
I bought mine for $3000 four years ago, condition as mint as you can 
possibly demand from an '82, but it had a few mechanical and
electrical problems which would have been expensive to have a mechanic
fix, but I could fix relatively easily myself (fried blower, and
messed up lights and similar small things). Thus the price lower than 
&quot;book value&quot;.

   Did they come as a 5 speed?  

Yes, but this is probably hard to find in NA. Common in Europe.

   How is the hill power?

Not impressive. More like a truck or bus than a car. After having
learned a little &quot;diesel driving technique&quot; (basically simple:
conserve momentum, accelerate well before the hills, right gear...)
keeping 50-60 is no problem on most &quot;expressway grades&quot; Country
roads in hilly terrain often means 3rd gear and 35-45 during
long upphills.

   Did they have a synchro version using a diesel?  

Yes, but not in NA. They are common in Europe.

   I was concerned about parts for the Vanagon, but if we go VW, I am thinking
   that 
   the Vanagon is the right choice, because the car feels safer, is more
   roomy, and 
   does much better in crosswinds.  The range is better for the diesel and if
   I add
   an extra tank which may be possible I would have a 800 mile range, which would
   allow us to really get off the beaten path without carrying jerry cans.

Personally I would consider an early 70's bus for a south america
adventure. The better handling in the vanagon is not so important if
I'm going to drive slow anyway. The bus has a slight edge off road,
and the 1600 upright must be the most widespread engine in the world.
With a bus I would also be more inconspicous (at least in mexico and
brazil), while the square vanagon immediately advertizes &quot;gringo&quot;.

   Parts could be a problem though, so I need to keep it simple, like no power
   steering, no AC.  The windshield is the only part I am really worried
   about.  Diesels can be fixed almost anywhere.

Mechanics in the outback are usually very creative when it comes
to fixing things when spares are unavailible. Windshield breaks
in the middle of argentina -- get closest fit possible from junk car
and seal the gaps with whatever material is availible. Problem
is of course that with precision machined parts (ie in engine and
injection pump) the &quot;creative approach&quot; is not likely to work.

   One last question, what color is the interior?  Did the 82-83 come in
   anything but the woodgrain.  I am partial to the white formica in the later
   models, but this is only a minor point.

Thankfully I have the white interior in my '82. I think I have seen
both the simulated wood and the white in early eighties. Pictures
are avilible under the &quot;luxurious living..&quot; link on:

There are also some testimonies from other diesel fanatics on the
&quot;testimonies..&quot; link.
