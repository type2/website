Joel said:
&gt; it's remotely possible that you have a bad motor mount and some whirling
&gt; part of the engine (like a belt or some such) is whacking on something
&gt; else as the engine tilts during accleration. the cv ought to make
&gt; tok-tok-tok or knok-knok-knok noises. imho.  sort of. maybe.
I hadn't thought of motor mounts... The noise is a knock-knock, which 
increases in volume as the throttle is pressed. Going up a hill is 
very loud, coasting was fine. It *seemed* to be related to road speed 
not engine speed, although I can't be certain. Noise went away 
completely after 15 minutes of highway driving, so now I can't really 
check it again. 

&gt; anyway, if it is the cv joint, it should do it worse in reverse, and on
&gt; hills and on curves (where one wheel has to rotate faster than the other).
That's what I thought, but someone told me the inboard joint would 
only be affected by acceleration &lt;?&gt;

&gt; good luck. &gt; joel
&gt; p.s. me personally, i'd go for the Lobro. they are original equipment on the
&gt; buses. and you might ... just might ... get away with cleaning and regreasing
&gt; and new rubber boots.
I would, but if it's the inner, I've already done that one 2 yrs ago, 
which means the outer is still stock, and soon to go also. And I hate 
CV grease... :(
