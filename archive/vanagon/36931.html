&gt;    I now have 5000k on the rebuilt motor from GEX (1600SP) and #4 is a 
&gt;     low 105 PSI.  Motor is HARD to start, cuts out while running, runs 
&gt;     rough, blah, blah.  So, I called GEX on friday and explained that this 
&gt;     head was cracked around #4 valve guide when I got it but on the advice 
&gt;     of GEX at that time and my own impatience at getting the bus ('66 
&gt;     standard/camper) on the road so I could put my Moto Guzzi down for 
&gt;     extensive repair, I put it together and crossed my fingers.  Stupid!!  
&gt;     Before installing I photographed the cracked case and sent pics to GEX 
&gt;     with a cover letter.  
&gt;     
&gt;     Ok so here we are 5000k later and the motor comes out again (I'm 
&gt;     getting good at this!).  I'll pull the head tonight and inspect and 
&gt;     send back to GEX regardless, due to the crack.  I'll also be looking 
&gt;     at rings, etc.  My hope is that I can get a decent head this time and 
&gt;     that I won't have to mess with htis again for a long time.  While I'm 
&gt;     waiting I need to replace seals in the tranny and rebuild the 
&gt;     starter/solenoid.  Stay tuned for the story on how GEX handles the 
&gt;     problem.

If the crack you refer to is a normal one that occurs around the valve seat,
it is probably not cause of low compression.  You should have a leak down
test performed to determine source of leakge before dissasembling engine.  I
would be careful about blasting GEX or any other vendor unless I was
&quot;Absolutey&quot; sure they did wrong.  I would not want to be defending myself for
slander.  Many things can and do happen to rebuilt engines.  Especialy air
cooled.  Many low compression problems are caused by the heads not sealing to
the cylinders.  Worn and warped cases will cause the cylinders to not sit
perfectly parelell.  This will cause these failures and most people don't
think to check this.
