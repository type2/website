&gt;I'm trying to adjust my spring plates to level the bus, but I need to remove
&gt;the emergency brake cable so I can move the bearing housing out of the way.
&gt;I've got the brake shoes off and the cable disconnected at both ends, but
&gt;what I really need help with is how to get the cable &quot;housing&quot; (the outer
&gt;part of the cable) detatched either from the backing plate or from the
&gt;metal tube it's connected to at the other end.  Bentley and Haynes don't
&gt;really show that part and I can't figure out how it's supposed to
disconnect.
&gt;Thanks!

I'm not sure about your '71 but on my '72 they slip out and in of the
backing.  That could be because, I think, they are the originals.  The old
Bently (hard back, color wiring diagrams)  that I'm using from the library
shows a clip (Number 19 in Figure 8-1 on Page 23 of Chapter 8).

Hope this helps.
