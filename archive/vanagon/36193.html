Subject: Horn wire connection to steering column

I traced out the circuit for the horn in my '73 camper and
found the open circuit at the base of the steering column.

There is a brown wire with a female spade connector dangling
near the steering box.  This is supposed to connect to a male
connector that is very hard to get to.  I could not see the
male connector at the base of the steering column from under
the car.

I tried to gain access from inside the cockpit by removing 2
screws that hold down a metal plate.  The steering column has
a plastic sleeve around it to prevent grounding to the metal
plate and the frame.  The metal plate seems to be held onto 
the steering column by the plastic sleeve.  I know the connector 
is &quot;right under there&quot; but I could not get to it from the inside 
of the van.

I did not want to bust the plastic collar to get at the connector.
Intuition tells me that part is either obsolete or expen$ive.
There must be a trick or special tool that will allow access or
removal of the plastic sleeve.  Do you squeeze it and then slide
it up the column or something?

Does anyone know the trick to reattaching the brown wire?
