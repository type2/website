  My '85 Westy's got 153K km on it now and has run like a charm since
I bought it in Halifax last year (when it had 123K km on it). The engine
appears to be in excellent shape and has only failed to start once
when it got so cold here in T.O. that there wasn't much point going to
work anyway (nothing that a little gas line anti-freeze couldn't fix).
My exhaust pipes are reaching the end of their life span, but the
body's in great shape. I've been wondering myself about what sort of
mileage (kilometreage) to expect from this baby. I use her as a daily
driver right now, but I think that I'm going to use her much less next
winter when I move back to Waterloo...
