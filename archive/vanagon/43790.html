Subject: Ben &amp; Jerry's VW event info request

Hello,
        Does anyone out there have info on the Ben and Jerry's VW event
this coming weekend?  I have a chance to go and I need to make plans
quickly so that I can hit the road ASAP.
        If you have the location, dates, and times, I would be very
appreciative if you could forward the info to me.  I am currently not
signed onto the list, so a post to my personal address will be required.
        Thanks for the help, and I hope to see some bus folks out east.
dave.
