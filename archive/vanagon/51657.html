&gt;     Tom,
&gt;     
&gt;       Here's my input from a West coast perspective--usually higher than 
&gt;     East coast, $8K would be a real good price.  $10K would be average 
&gt;     retail.
&gt;       Ask when the heads were last rebuilt--they usually need them by 115K 
&gt;     mi.  It could cost some significant money if they need to be done.

&gt;Hello volks,
&gt;     
&gt;What is a good price for an 86 westy GL(its the full camper not a 
&gt;weekender).  Its in good shape ie: body straight-no dents, small surface 
&gt;rust on front spoiler and inside front doors, 115K, interior very clean, 
&gt;engine runs good. 
&gt;     
&gt;Also as this would be my first vanagon westy, what things should I be on the 
&gt;look out for?  Any particular quirks or problems with this year or model?
&gt;     
&gt;Thanks :) 
&gt;
