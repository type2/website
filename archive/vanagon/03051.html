&gt; 
&gt; Well, I have a problem with my oil overheating.  Still.  After all the
&gt; things I have tried to solve the problem.  I don't really know what
&gt; else to do at this point, so I am considering an aftermarket system.  I
&gt; agree that the stock cooler is woefully small.  When my bus gets warmed
&gt; up the oil pressure will slowly drop and begin to fluctuate (this may be
&gt; a separate problem, I know).  Eventually, the pressure will drop to a
&gt; point where I am no longer comfortable running the engine.  Allowing
&gt; the engine to cool restores the pressure, so I must conclude that the oil
&gt; is overheating.  Cylinder Head Temparature remains rock solid at a
&gt; comfortable temperature (???), usually around 200-250 fahrenheit.
&gt; I just changed my oil and put in straight 30 weight instead of the
&gt; 20-50 I normally use.  The pressure goes down a lot faster now.  Ugh.
&gt; I'm gonna give synthetic a try next oil change...

Whoa...I did not know you had low oil pressure problem.  Are you sure?
Make sure the sensor and gauge are working properly.  I don't know how
you test them, but be sure you're that's correct.  After that I would
check out the pressure relief valves.  I don't remember what you drive
but you may have one or to of these valves that determine whether or
not oil will be channeled to the oil cooler or not.  If it uses a
spin-on filter, then be sure to use the right brand of filter and not
that cheapo brand. ;) For summer time, I think your temperature gauge
sounds about right.  I have to assume your engine seals/hoses are in 
good shape and &quot;doing their thing right&quot;.  Oh, make sure the fan belt 
is at the proper tension too.

Hope this helps,
Steven
