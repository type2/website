Subject: Re: 914/6 motor

Here are data for Porsche 914/916 from a couple of issues
of Porsche Panorama ('85 &amp; '94):

914/4 (Porsche in US, VW/Porsche in Europe) '70-'76, 115,000 produced.

914/6 produced '70-'72, 3351 made/1788 imported to US.
      engine: same as '69 911T--2.0 liter 110 DIN HP.

914/6GT produced '70-'71.  Under 500 made.  Won GT class at '70
        Le Mans.  Dropped in 6/71.

916 to have been the street version of the GT.  2.4L 911S 190HP
    engine.  13 prototypes in '71-'72.  


In another place, Bruce Anderson, Tech Chair of PCA, says it is
&quot;easy to rebuilt 914/4 2.0L engines to 130 HP&quot; and he recommends
that over trying to beef up 914/4 1.7 or 1.8L engines.  He says
to use European heads, higher compresson p&amp;c and Webers.  The
stock 2.0L engine had 95 HP in '73-'74 and then 88 HP in '75-'76.
