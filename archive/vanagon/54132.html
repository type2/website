That's correct...the 370 doesn't come in the 205.  I spoke with Yokohama
in Dallas and they said it was not available.  The only 205 LT I was
able to find locally here in Seattle was the Michelin MXL.  I have those
on my Jetta and they are one stiff loud tire! On top of that, I have
found, the rain and snow traction is marginal. I wouldn't recommend
them.

&gt; 	Does Yokohama make a 205/70 R14?  The Y370G is a 185/70 R14 isn't it?

&gt;you're right,   Y370's are  in that one size only.  I looked through the
&gt;light truck Tire pamphlet from Yokohama &amp; didn't see a 205/70.  The nearest
&gt;one was an LT195/75R14 8(D) 5.5 inch rim width.  Max load _at_ cold pressure
&gt;(lbs) is 1710 _at_ 65.  The model number is Y356.
