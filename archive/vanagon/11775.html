Dave K. and Dave S. mentioned that no. 3 is still furthest from the fan in
the last of the air-cooled engines, so even though it isn't blocked by the
oil cooler it still may run &quot;hot&quot; relative to the others (in theory); I am
sceptical but you are right about no. 3 being the early warning cyinder. If
the temp ranges between the four are different, you would expect no.
3 to be the highest... the big question is would the gauges we have be
accurate enough to pick up this difference.....?  .....DC
