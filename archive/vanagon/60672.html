Subject: Re: engine stopping (thanks)

I wanted to pass on my thanks to all of those who responded so quickly to my
stalling plight.  I just discovered after reading through the previous
owners service records that this is a repeat problem.  The previous owner
spent hundreds of dollars at Eero VW in Juneau on a new coil, and
alternator.  It appears that they did a lot of disconnecting and
reconnecting of wires.  The service report says that the problem occurs when
the car is &quot;wet&quot;.  This is exactly what happened to me.  It was pouring on
the day of the shut down, preceeded by several days of unusually sunny and
warm weather where I had no evidence of a problem.  I do not know if this
additional clue helps isolate the problem further, but I think you have
pointed me in the right directon with the air flow meter, fuel filter and
possible shorts.

You folks are great
