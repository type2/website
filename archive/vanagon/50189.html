Subject: &quot;House Tags,&quot; &quot;Motor Homes,&quot; and Insurance

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Listees,

Prompted by the discussion on the list about motor homes, house tags and
insurance, I called my insurance carrier here in Texas, GEICO, and
explained that upon registration of the vehicle, I had failed to specify
that my Vanagon was a Westfalia,&quot;a motor home' and certified as such by the
California Department of Motor Vehicles in the state in which I bought the
vehicle. There is even a tag on the front door post declaring that the ID
decal is the property of the State of California. I've seen similar posting
by other states, but I never paid much attention to them. I told her the
vehicle had beds, refrigerator, stove, running water when it was parked and
a &quot;personal convenience,&quot; as necessary.

The nice lady on the other end of the line said she'd call me back, and
late this afternoon, on the same day I inquired about the definition of my
vehicle for insurance purposes, she researched the topic and telephoned
with the pleasant news of a reduction in premium of about 45 percent for
the year.

I registered the car as a private vehicle, not unlike my &quot;regular&quot; car, so
appearantly the Texas DMV is not involved in the definition of a Vanagon as
anything other than a motor vehicle.  I have not researched the &quot;open
container&quot; ramifications of my windfall, but I feel certain that any rural
justice of the peace would accept the definition posted on the door frame. 

Now, for all of you guard house lawyers, here's the question, &quot;Is the
Westfalia, for purposes of &quot;a man's home is his castle,&quot; a &quot;home&quot; or just
&quot;wheels?&quot;

In any case, I suggest that each Westy (camper, retrofitted-do-it yourself
vehicle) owner check with his insurance carrier BEFORE querying the DMV,
Highway Patrol, Department of Public Safety, or any other organization
which issues license plates. I chose not to muddy the water by inquiring of
the authorities if there were a classification of licenses in Texas for
mobile homes.  If there is, I'll let others worry about it.

 A refund is in the mail.
