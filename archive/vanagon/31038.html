&gt;No, No, No Steve! You are half correct. Max did drive a Sunbeam Tiger but
in some episodes or some season &lt; hard to tell in reruns&gt; DID indeed drive a
Ghia Convert.  I noticed this while I owned my long since gone '70 Ghia
'vert. I still would love to drive either one again.

&gt;&gt;Didn't Maxwell Smart drive up in a Karmen(SP) Ghia during the
&gt;&gt;opening shot of &quot;Get Smart&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Nope-- that was a Sunbeam Tiger. Same size and weight as a Ghia, but
&gt;with a Ford 289 V8 engine under the hood. My dad used to say you could
&gt;remove the drive shaft from that car, and drive it around powering it
&gt;with the cooling fan...
&gt;
&gt;And, adding injury to insult, Agent 86 crashed it into the rear of
&gt;a truck every episode (shudder)
