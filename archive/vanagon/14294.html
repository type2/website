Thanks to all for the information about the &quot;S&quot; switch.

At least now I know why I have not missed using it. And will not miss using it in the 
future. :)

Speaking of a &quot;sport&quot; characteristic for the transmission in a Eurovan with a 
Weekender Package reminds me of the race between the tortoise &amp; the hare. Not only 
did the hare &quot;know&quot; it was going to win the race but it figured away to not be too tired 
for the after-race partying and celebration. The hare rode on the back of the tortoise 
until they got to about one inch from the finish line. Then the hare jumped off and let 
the wind resistance hold back the opponent. :)

Martha: How does it go -&gt; &quot;We don't need no steekin' SPORT switch&quot; &lt;-
