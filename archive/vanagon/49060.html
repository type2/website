Subject: Subaru 3.3litre 230HP wasser

OK folks, power lusters etc.  Posting in rec.4x4 showed a Subaru SVX with 6
cylinders and 24 valves, and KEP lists the adapter plate for it same as one
for 2.2l Subaru. It makes 230HP, and a newer version with 280HP is in works.
Engine is 21&quot; long, may just fit! Having more than 2.4x the power of a VW
wasser box would be amazing, up there with the 3.2l Porsche conversions of
MSDS, likely way cheaper, plus heat!  Anyone ever seen an SVX in a junkyard?
Please say yes.  bye, tim.
