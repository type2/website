I have ordered the Bus Boys catalog as well, and have yet to receive it
or have my check cashed.  I did order their Vanagon front floor mats and
I couldn't be more pleased with them.  Heavy grade rubber, cool Vanagon
motif in the center and they fit like a glove.

With regards to West Coast Metric, I have their catalog at home and I'm
at work. :-(  I can't remember if they stock the head gasket sets or not.
I'll bring the catalog in with me Monday and let you know, unless someone
beats me to it.
