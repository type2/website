Doug,
   Good show man!! I have to drive through that neighborhood everyday,
both ways. It is not a place that anybody without weapons should be.
I got my wife a cellular for christmas so her beltway commute would be
safer. My advice to you in the next circumstance is to let your ride 
block traffic on the hiway (50) and let the cops call you a tow!
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER get off the hiway in that hood! what a shame we live
like this.
