Subject: friend's '84 keeps stalling

Hello,

my friend's problem sounds like what many of you waterboxer owners have
described: sporadic stalling associated with the electronics of the
air-flow box. I visually inspected his ECU, but couldn't find any loose
solder. I'm going to suggest that he buy the auxiliary wiring harness (p/n
025 906 302), although I have second thoughts: from the archives I got the
impression that after turning off the ignition, the engine will restart
right away. My friend's '84, however, sometimes refuses to start for
almost half an hour, then will run normally. 

Any thoughts or opinions, anyone? (Wild guess: O2 sensor needs to cool off?)

TIA,

Sami ('75 Westf.)
