Subject:      FFFriday FFFollies: repeat for the summer

since it's getting into summer time and a lot of you will be taking to the
road in your buses of various conditions, i thought perhaps it would be
a good idea to repeat a little poem from last year ...     :)


Tales of the Workshop
by  Robert W. Service-Advisor         :)

The Rules

When they step up inside, as you go for a ride,
And the first thing they see are the tools,
Then they'll ask with a smirk if you do your own work,
Cause they have no idea of the Rules.

For it's Tried and it's True: What you carry with you
Will help you get back; and it's certain
What you leave back at home, as the country you roam,
Will not help on the road when you're hurtin'.

As you go through the years, you will learn from your tears
All the tools you will need on the road,
And you increase the weight, in attempts to cheat fate,
Adding more and more tools to your load.

So the bus weighs a lot. Even more when you've got
All the spare parts your money can buy
Hidden under the seat, stacked so careful and neat,
In the hope Murphy's Law won't apply.

Now, it's sad, but in trucks, fuel economy sucks,
And gets worse with all that piled aboard.
But the point we make here is that gas ain't so dear;
Don't let tools and spare parts be ignored.

And since Murphy still lives, and he seldom forgives
No matter how much you have pleaded,
The Rules make it plain, but we'll state it again:
Carry with you whatever is needed.
