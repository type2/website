Subject: Vanagon Tent-clues to origin?

     
     I might be looking at a tent in the next day or two and was wondering what 
     the distinguishing features are that might indicate whether or not the tent 
     is :
     
     1. westy original or &quot;aftermarket?&quot;
     2. made for vanagon or breadloaf
     
     The person that has it now bought it used and doesn't have a clue.  She 
     mentioned that she had trouble with the connection to the bus, both the 
     raingutter attachment and the rope for sealing the fabric tunnel to the 
     van.
     
     Also, she had it stored and couldn't recall the color.  She did mention 
     that the frame was external.
     
     Any help would be appreciated.
     
     Thanks,
