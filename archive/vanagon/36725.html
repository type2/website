Subject: re: '82 Diesel Smoke

Hey Duds,

I thought the burp of smoke was normal when doing a cold start?  If it 
clears up, what's the harm?  Just wondering!

&gt; rough.  After running a few minutes it clears up and
&gt; warm he runs fine.  I suspect a faulty injector,
&gt; however, I don't have the special VW tool that Bentley
&gt; recommends for testing.

&gt; Try loosening one fuel line at a time at the injector - if you can 
&gt; loosen one of them with no difference in the idle, then that injector 
&gt; is bad.
&gt; Note: You will only need to loosen enough to release the fuel ressure 
&gt; - don't loosen too much!
