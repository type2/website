Subject:      interesting government documents ... on the web

you Eurovan owners might want to look at

http://www.customs_dot_ustreas_dot_gov/imp-exp/rulings/hqrule/hqcr1925.html

and Vanagon folks (later models) might want to look at

http://www.customs_dot_ustreas_dot_gov/imp-exp/rulings/hqrule/hqcr658.html


... and then ask yourself why the government put those pages out there.  ??
