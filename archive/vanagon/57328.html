Subject: Re: Berg Short Shift Kit in Syncro

     I finally ordered and installed a Gene Berg Shift Kit in my '90 Syncro 
     Westy. I'm happy to report that the installation was a snap (following 
     the directions religiously) and now my pride and joy shifts like a 
     dream! It truly is amazing what a difference it makes! 
     
     For those interested the correct part number is, GB6785.
     
     My thanks to Tim at Berg's for researching the compatibility issues.

     Has anyone ever installed Gene Berg's Short Shift Kit in a Syncro or 
     know if it's possible? I called and asked the folks at Gene Berg but 
     they didn't know. Maybe someone's tried it (?).
