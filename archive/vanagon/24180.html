Subject: Re: Rolling Stone VWUS/Jerry Garcia Ad

&gt;While at the Lawrence, MA VW show Sunday, I overheard a conversation
&gt;regarding an ad in the next issue of the Rolling Stone from VW US.
&gt;
&gt;Aparently its a line drawing of the front of a Splittie with a tear
&gt;rolling out of one side windshield
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

actually i think it was rolling out of the headlight if it really matters
