Last night I recieved the new outriggers from Das Bulli.  BTW - there
are supposed to be 6, not 4, outriggers.  2 long ones on the front 
and 4 short ones in the back.  The length difference is because the
frame is not straight, but actually bends just aft of the middle.

So I got the new inner wheel well plate that I just fabbed welded in,
and then welded the frame rail to that, and then the outrigger welded
on between the frame rail and the inner rocker.

I woulda welded on the rear outrigger, but there was this pesky piece
of solid metal left from the original one (the nerve!) that I had
to cut out, made more delicate by the fact that the e-brake cable
tube runs right across it, and I don't want to damage it.

Steve Johnson came over to scrounge some parts and take his very first
welding lesson, and that pretty much wrapped up the evening...
