Subject: Re: I need help! I'm about to shoot the syncro

&gt;| I have a problem with my syncro. The thing vibrates at about 45mph on 
&gt;| up. I removed the drive shaft, It checked out O.K. Without drive shaft 
&gt;| installed, there is no vibration. HMMM?

	Sounds like you need a new driveshaft or to find a place that will
rebuild the Universal joints on each end (very very hard to find was the
consuses of the list).

&gt;| (Valentines day) We got snow, and I got stuck ( I forgot to mention that 
&gt;| I just bought this thing. I'm familiar with 2wd Vanagons. Never owned a 
&gt;| syncro) Real wheels spin, nothing happens up front.

	Did you reinstall the driveshaft?

&gt;|  Am I correct to 
&gt;| assume that I have a problem with my front diff.......possibly my 
&gt;| viscous coupling?

	If you have reinstalled the driveshaft, it would be a fair assumption
that either the VC or some other part of the front diff is hosed. I am not
sure how to figure out if it is a diff problem or a VC except by opening
things up.
