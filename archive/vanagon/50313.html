Subject: Re: Clutch cylinder rebuild kits?

Yes, both clutch master and slave cylinder kits are available,
but not easily obtainable.  I've rebuilt both.

As to the slave cylinder, the price differential between the
rebuild kit and a new cylinder is around $40, so going with the
new cylinder makes sense to me.

&gt; weeks readying her for the camping this weekend and boom
&gt; pedal falls to floor.  Inspections shows cylinder pumping
&gt; nothing, removal shows internal corrosion (not too bad)
&gt; and seals shot.  I hope to take the '85 cylinder out and
&gt; swap tomorrow morning when I get light, if I can figure
&gt; out a way to bleed it myself.  I guess its MityVac time.
