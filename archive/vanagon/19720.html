&gt;&gt;    If you could live the extra height as a fixed item, this would be a
&gt;&gt;wonderful camper. I want one for christmas.

My 72 camper has this boat top option.  The head room is great and at one
time there was a upper bed in it.  So far the i have found only to real
problems.  One is gas milage, but this could be due to really nasty engine.
 Two, is I can seem to find a place that has a garage door that is tall
enough to put it in.  It would be nice to have the removable boat version I
read about earlier.
