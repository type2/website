Subject: Battery diodes

The 82 Westfalia has a way of &quot;monitoring&quot; the state of the battery - a
switch with three dodes is located on the stove panel. Ours no longer works
-even though the battery is fully charged. Does anyone have any ideas on
how to fix or check the switch/diode set-up?

Thanks - David C.
