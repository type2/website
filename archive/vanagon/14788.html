Subject: 73 bus for sale

A friend of my sister's is selling her bus, and I told her I'd post it to 
the list.  I only know what my sister told me her friend told her about 
it.  I've never seen it, so I can't vouch for it one way or the other.

Location: Mission, B.C. Canada (about an hour east of Vancouver)

'73 VW bus 'camperized' 
runs well, aircared [passed the BC emissions testing]
some surface rust, has a bra 
Orange colour, black seats, interior in good condition
rebuilt motor
$2500 CDN obo

I don't know how many miles it has on the rebuild or overall, whether 
it's a westfalia or some other conversion.  Any further inquires should 
NOT be directed to the list or to this account; instead, telephone the 
owner directly:
