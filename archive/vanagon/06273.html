&gt;&gt;&gt;Anybody else have any good bus-ice-and-snow anecdotes? 

Best &quot;not to be repeated&quot; effort on my part was on a highly crowned ice 
covered road, a shortcut from the local ski area. Knowing the likelyhood of 
someone being hung up in the snowbank in a set of S bends I approached 
cautiously, 20mph max. Not one but two vehicles stuck, on either side of the 
road, with a little space between them! Ah-Ha I can make it, followed by 
uh-uh better not do it, so I gently pointed the '71 Westy at the snowbank, 
since braking was just a concept. Well, the passengers wheel touched the 
bank first, and stopped dead. The back of the bus pivotted around 
gracefully, initiating a 360 that brought us round to that little gap 
between the cars. I drove through while graciously waving to the small crowd 
that had fled to the top of the snowbanks when they realized what was going 
on.  No applause, just a lot of stares.    tim s.
