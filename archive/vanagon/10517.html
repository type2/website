Well, there was an article on just such a replacement within the past 6
months-- in Hot VW's I believe.

As will probably be repeated over and over, consult the Idiot Manual by John
Muir for the best, easiest to understand and follow instruction.

I sympathize, as I will do the same to my '62 Kombi this spring. Lemme know
how it goes!
