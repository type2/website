Subject: VW's for sale: EV and Bus

Local paper had a couple of VW's some of you might be interested in.
Both numbers are on Bainbridge Island. Other than that I know nothing about
them, although I could be persuaded to take a look this weekend perhaps.

they are:

1993 VW Eurovan Westfalia Camper. Great condition, only 17K miles.
Cooler, 2 beds, built-ins. $19,000 obo. $10,000 less than new.
206-780-5218

1977 VW Van. new tires, strong engine. $1200/obo. 206-842-1162.
