Subject:  pilot bearing r/r (more help!) addendum

i forgot to mention in the previous post... in addition to heving no
resistance on the clutch pedal and the slave cylinder not returning all the
way,  the van won't start now, it just turns over slowly.

thanks for any help, 
matthew (81 adventurewagen)

p.s.-  just sent the (wrong) parts back to parts place...will post my luck
with getting a cash refund.
