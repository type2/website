&gt; The O2 light came on on my 85 van last week. It has 150K on it.
&gt;  How do I shut this off?  At what milestone was this supposed to come on?

Paul,

The O2 light comes on every 25k.  It indicates that its time to replace your
O2 sensor.  Change the sensor and then reset the light.  The reset switch is
on a small (3-4&quot;) located under the steering column area inline of the
odometer cable.
