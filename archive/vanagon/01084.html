&gt;&gt;ok, folks. there's entirely toooo many 'Unknown buses' out there. i
&gt;&gt;know a bunch of you are Bus-Wannabees, but that only accounts for about
&gt;&gt;ten of you. howzabout you new folks letting me know what model and year
&gt;&gt;bus you are driving. and what city/state you are located in. just for
&gt;&gt;the sake of ... well, i don't know. curiosity? :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;joel
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;OK Joel, here you go:  I've got or JUST got rather a '87 Westfalia and
&gt;since I see from your list the &quot;87s are the most populus I just had to let
&gt;you and the others know that I have &quot;one&quot; also.  So far it's doing it's
&gt;job.  Broke the ignition key off in the gas cap, VW wanted $10.00 for the
&gt;key but got one at the local locksmith for $3.00 and he freed up the stuck
&gt;drivers door lock for free.  Then there's the exaust leak the just got
&gt;worse,  seems to be coming from the joint between the manifold pipes and
&gt;the right angle pipe to the muffler.  Two simple, little, ordinary
&gt;gaskets, $10.00 each, plus tax !!!!  Whoa, hold on here, what if something
&gt;really important breaks ?????  I don't want to know the answer to that one. 
&gt;Well, I'm up here in Carp, Ontario, Canada that is.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Frank  (also MGB bitten with  a '69 and  a '73 roadster -  plus a dead 85 
&gt;jeep cheerokee)
