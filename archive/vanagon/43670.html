Lemme see, they are gonna follow a man w/ a good political reputation 
with a good looking 67 Beetle.  Now, when I had my Beetle I was 
constantly being stopped by people who wanted to tell me how fondly 
they remember THEIR Beetle and others simply wanted to offer money 
for it.  Somehow having a 67 Beetle follow the chap doesn't sound 
like a smear campaign but more like political assistance :-)
