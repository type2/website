     I would think they would be obligated to perform the work irrespective of 
     the owner or the age of the vehicle.  At least that is the experience I had 
     with 12 year old 1975 Volvo I once owned.
     
     The dealer actually pointed out the fact that my car hadn't received the 
     work, which involved replacing the fuel tank and filler spout, and took 
     care of it immediately.

Is there any way to deterine if a particular vehicle has or has not been 
serviced for factory recalls? Does VWoA keep a database that they will 
check for you?
     
Will VWoA perform free recall work only for original owners upon receipt of 
recall letter?
     
Thanks,
