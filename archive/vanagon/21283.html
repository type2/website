Subject:      vw bus/vanagon/eurovan rentals around Disneyland

somebody posted this a while back: don't know if it's the same place as
the American Safari Rent-A-Camper ...

VAC Group                              Westfalia Rentals

(714) 497-0626
         Prices:
         $62/day for Standard
         $72/day for Luxury * (I have to laugh; and I quote:
              'Luxury vehicles are newer models equipped w/
               water-cooled engines')
         Three days min.; 100 miles/day free w/ 1,000 free miles max.
         per trip. $0.19/mile over free miles.
         Additional camping set (includes sleeping bags, sheets,
         pillows, cases, hand towels, bath towels, cook set, utensils,
         cutlery, plastes, cups, can opener, matches, &amp; first aid kit)
         $50/trip.

another alternative would be to fly into Albuquerque, NM and drive the
rest of the way (giving the kid a wide-eyed view of the mountains and the
desert). :)  &lt;and, no, i don't have any idea how far it would be!&gt;
