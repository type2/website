&lt;&lt; Tell me more about your improvements to the air conditioning of 
 your westie
 		I am very interested in doing something to make summers 
 bearable in my 86 westie &gt;&gt;
Dave, I lived until recently in the foothills of San Diego where temps were
regularly over 100 for 9 months.I bought a universal evaporator/blower
housing from my wholesale a/c supplier in Sacramento and placed it up over
the glove box area.I bought 2 more vw fesh air vents and installed them along
w/ the orig modified fesh air vent in the dash..I installed a 3 spd blower
sw. to control the front unit.I spliced in the
low side line back to the compressor w/ a tee and high side to the receiver
w/ a tee.I then replaced the Sanden SD08 compressor w/ a Sanden SD10 which is
10 cft versus 8 cuft...20% more capacity and only 11mm longer.You must do
some fabrication to the plastic a/c housing and foam seal the unit under the
dash.You also need a tool to crimp the ferrules on the hose connections to
get a good pro job,( a good a/c shop can crimp all the connections once you
have them in place) and of coarse need to evacuate and recharge system(again
an a/c shop can do this).I works great...you have a front unit blowing
rearward...and the orig. westy rear unit blowing forward.Before I did this I
used to roast in the front seat w/ all the glass, now my wife makes me turn
down the front unit which works independant of the rear, cuz it is so
cold.This takes some time...2 days and tinkering.. but it is a nice
install.It doesnt take away from the glove box and the 3 air vents on the
right side look like a factory job.
If anyone else out there in the group is interested I will get the part#s and
supplier address and write a tech article How-to for the archives.See ya.
