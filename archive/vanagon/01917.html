	Jeepers, the mail system on Victoria freenet has been
	down for a week. Its pretty frustrating reading the
	incoming mail and not being able to butt in.  Kinda
	like keeping your mouth shut in a company meeting.

	Anyway, let me add my bit...

	carb synching.
		
		Make sure that all of the hoses assoc. with
		fuel/air system are good.
		Check central idle air and fuel adjustment
		screws to see if they really work. Sometimes
		the central idle system fuel shut-off solenoid
		sounds like its working but isn't.
		Any play in throttle shaft?
		Points and timing ok?

	I have spent/wasted lots of time snynching my 72's
	carbs. Finally got old Werner, the aircoolled guru,
	to do them right. He had no CO meter (by the way,
	somebody out there must know how to take the mV
	signal from an oxy sensor and use in place of a
	CO meter), but he got the beast running smoothly.

	Oil

		For some reason I have 10W-40 in my jetta
	powered van. I don't like it and am changing to 
	Mobil-1 this weekend. Reason? the new engine runs
	hotter than the old diesel, (I have to get an
	alternator cooling duct/shroud from a late model
	Audi to keep it cooler), and I notice a definite
	loss of pressure when the needle creeps past the
	LED in hot idle situations. I theorize viscosity
	breakdown. BTW, the previous owner had put in a
	switch to turn on the rad fan, I used only on
	slow steep hills last summer with the diesel.
	I rewired to the stock situation and the fan
	does come on now when the needle is halfway
	between the LED and the far right. It is 
	important that there is NO air in the cooling
	system as the thermo switches are at the top of
	the rad - in &quot;air&quot; if not bled!


	My van is Alpin Weiss (these German names for colours
	both attract and repel me - maybe reflective of the
	ambigious relationship my ancestors had with the
	Hun!).

	Joel, the colour code is L90, for your dbase!

	Phew!

	Have a great weekend,

	Alistair
