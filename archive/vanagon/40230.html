It was a good show indeed, thanks for the report sean.  Don't forget 
about the nice type 3/4 in the parking lot.  Sorry to those of you who 
were supposed to meet us at smith's vw, but alas he stiffed us and was a 
no show.  I wandered around in me list t-shirt, but only got one 
comment.  It was a nice starter and has me looking forward to the other 
summer shows.
