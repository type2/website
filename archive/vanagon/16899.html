So Rich Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt; The first time I had the brake pads replaced was at 100K (bought it at 95k).
&gt; The dealer did the work and used whatever the dealer uses. Right away the
&gt; pads started leaving black dust on the alloy wheels which had not happened
&gt; before. For the next 37k miles, I have put up with the awful black dust on
&gt; my nice allow wheels. :-(

I've had brake dust from day one of owning my van and have never heard
of other pads that don't.  I really prefer OEM brakes for all of my cars
since they seem to work the best.  But it ain't no fun trying to keep
those alloys clean.  So I know what you mean.

&gt; Well the pads started squeeking a little the other day, so I am thinking
&gt; maybe I will change the pads this time, especially if you guys can tell me a
&gt; good brand/type of pad to buy that wont garf up my wheels and will not
&gt; squeek excessively.
&gt; 

I used some of that anti-squeal/squeek goop on the back of my pads and it
seems to keep them from making any noise.  You might try it on your next
pad change.
