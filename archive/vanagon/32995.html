Subject: FS 87 Getaway Vanagon, Vancouver

&gt;From the local paper;

87 VW Vanagon Getaway, slightly raised roof, new motor, alloys, blue. 
$6800 Cdn.  604-434-6053

Called the owner and it turns out that the motor is one year old, 
from VW, and there is *no* interior in the rear of the van.  The 
conversion I guess is only half done, my impression was that the 
Vanagon was gutted for the conversion, and the guy stopped after 
doing everything but the inside.  No fridge, no bed, no 'walls' (I 
think he means the interior walls are exposed).

Anyways if anyone wants to complete a custom camper, it could be 
worthwhile for you.

Usual disclaimers apply.
