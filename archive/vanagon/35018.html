Hi, my name is Dean Anderson,  I am co-owner of a shop called Bus Farmers.
My two partners
are Art and Todd.

I have a 

        '64 21-window, 
        '60 standard bus, 
        '54 panel, 
        '62 double cab, 
        '65 standard bus, 
        and a '65 bug

And I'm always on the lookout for pre '67 bus bits

Thanks to my computer geek friend Thom (thom_at_calweb_dot_com) for setting this
all up for me!
