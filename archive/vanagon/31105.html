Subject: RE:EV Bentley manual next summer


Well, I guess Bentley is up to their usual tricks. When I bought
the EV in 2/95, they said...&quot;The EV manual will be out this
summer&quot;.....when I called back a year later, they said... &quot;The
EV manual will be out this summer&quot;....and so on..and so on...
