&gt;  Can I cruise at 65 with no
&gt;worries?  Can I go faster (downhill with a tail wind :) )?  Please let
&gt;me know what you think.
&gt;
&gt;TIA,

Hia Matt,
I had (have) a 74 transporter (panel van) with the 1.8l engine (dual
carbs).  I took it on a trip from Northern Ontario, Canada to Los Cabos,
Mexico about 5 or 6 years ago.  I cruised at about 65 most of the time, and
lots of times a bit faster.  I never had a problem and the van made it all
the way down and back without missing a beat.  I found leaded gas in some
places and thought I would give it a try. . . never ran better! (maybe just
my imagination)

On my return trip, we were cruising along a long flat highway in California
or Nevada, or somewhere, it was a nice warm night and I broke my speed
record with it (actually my buddy was driving).  My old record was about 93
mph, and he buried the needle (the needle started jumping after about 97
mph)
That, of course is only what the speedo said.  No Idea if I was really
going that fast, but the whine and reverbs coming off the old 1.8 pretty
much confirmed it.  I wouldn't recommend holding it for very long if you
are going to try, but it sure cleans the crap out.

My trip totalled 8000 miles (under $500 in gas) in about a month, and the
engine ran fine for a couple of years after that.  Too many startings in
-40 degree weather eventually took its toll.

Is the 2.0 fuel injected? If so, are they governed?  I don't know much
about them.

I now drive an 85 transporter with a 1.9 wasserboxer (fuel injected), and
kinda miss my old 1.8 :~(
