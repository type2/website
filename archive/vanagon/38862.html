Subject: rusted brake bleeder valves


Hi,
	following advice from experts on the list, I have
changed the hoses that lead to the front calipers. However,
I can't bleed the brakes because the valves are rusted in 
place. Trying to open them with a 7mm wrench, the wrench
eventually turned around the piece.. Does someone have a
gpood idea how I can resolve this? I have to get it done
tomorrow because I need the van to pick up friends in 
Paris on Friday! 
Thanks a million!
