Subject: sliding windows in an 84
Date: Fri, 1 Jul 1994 10:19:53 -0700 (PDT)

Hello,
	My sliding side windows are making all sorts of horrible noises
now that the tiny bits of plastic that these things ride on have fallen by
the side of the road.  I went into the dealer and started to describe the
tiny bit of plastic and the parts guy said that when VoA discontinued that
part, he bought as many as they would let him.  Unfortunately, he ran out
of these things last year.  Does anyone know of a supply house that has
these darn things?  I'm using popsicle sticks right now to keep the
windows from rattling so much.

Thanks,

Alan Laird
