 but on a more technical note.. anybody ever have reverse shut the
&gt;engine down. Of course i just plucked the wires off the tranny but i'd like
&gt;to get my backing lights back sometime.  Is it a sensor or a short (getting
&gt;around to checking sometime soon)?????

I seem to remember the same thing happening  to me a few years back with my
'74 camper. I think(it's hard to remember) that I had connected a wire on
the coil backwards. Reverse would turn off the engine. Once switched back
things were fine. Somebody else figured it out for me.
