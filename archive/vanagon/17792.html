Subject:      rain-x

rain-x works pretty good, but there are a couple of things to beware of:

- your brain is processing a whole bunch of visual signals while driving,
and one of those signals is the water on the windshield ... with rain-x,
the water is acting in a manner suggestive of a much slower speed! so YOU
think you are traveling slower than you really are. this can be dangerous.

- do NOT ever put this stuff on the inside of your windshield!  it causes
all sorts of rainbows and glare at night when the oncoming headlights are
viewed through the windshield.

- BUT! it works great on outside rearview mirrors! keeps the dew/snow from
sticking. also on side windows and rear windows in winter/damp weather.

- also be careful NOT to get the stuff on your paint.
