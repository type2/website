Subject: June Bug Jamboree

For those of you wondering where the June Bug Jamboree flyer/entry forms 
are, they will be mailed next week.  I finally nailed down the graphic 
artist who does our show flyers, posters, and t-shirts (*very* busy guy, 
but he donates his services to the club, so I can't complain).  We pulled 
an all night session and got everything done.  The shirts this year are 
even better than last year's (for those Mid-Westerners who know what I'm 
talking about).  Very &quot;kewl&quot;.  If anyone would like a flyer, just send me 
your s-mail address.  If you can distribute several to friends, let me 
know.  Thanks for your patience.  :-)

   Don't forget:  Busses on '66' in Springfield, Missouri, June 14-16
                  June Bug Jamboree All-VW Show, June 15th.
