I just bought an AC Delco battery for the Vanagon at a cost of 65 CDN
(Price Costco). The Interstate gave out about two weeks ago (its weak
state  led me to believe the LEDs on the Westy were defective - they aren't).
I have had a CTC battery in there in the meantime. Unfortunately the CTC
has the incorrect depth (7&quot; max) so I had to leave the battery cover off -
this allowed fumes from the gas tank to enter the vehicle - annoying and
dangerous. Anyway the Delco fits, its cheap and its maintennce free.



Also as of this moment - I am painting the poptop of the Westy and
installing new rubber. Rather than go for gelcoat- here is what I did:

a) remove front carrier - wetsand with 320 and then 600  - wetsanding is
crucial to prevent &quot;pilling&quot;. Sand to a smooth surface.

b) patch any cracks with combination fibreglass resin (for strength) and
aluminum bondo (for flexibility). Apply externally (do not take internally).
Sand if necessary.

c) Two to three coats using interlux semi-gloss boat topside enamel.  I
found the glossy to be just that - with the possibility of &quot;blinding&quot;
oncoming drivers. Use the finest brush possible. This stuff goes on thick.

d) The main top can be painted while attached. I was able to spread myself
across the surface to both sand and paint hopefully not creating any cracks.

e) apply new rubber all around.

f) seal with silicone clear caulk (to prevent rusting of trim).


Results - 10-20% improvement in fuel economy (much smoother surface);
increased cooling of interior (due to reflected heat); can now flip van
upsidedown for quick crossing of Canal.


Bye - David C.
