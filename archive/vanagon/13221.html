Subject: '85 Vanagon CV probs.


	Muir mentions some sort of open washer/circlip type thing that 
should be on the inside of the CV's.  I'm replacing both of the left side 
joints on my '85 Vanagon.  I've got everything off the axle-shaft: outer 
circlips, the joints themselves, and the boots, I just don't understand 
about this inner open washer he's talking about.  The procedure says you 
need this washer so that you know how far to slide the new joints onto 
the axle-shaft.  Is this clear what I'm talking about?  Anyway...my 
joints didn't have these inner open washers.  I'm wondering how I'll know 
how far to slide the new joint down the shaft?  Any advice?
	Also...the old boots didn't have any clamps holding them in 
place, but I bought clamps with the new ones.  Is this right?  Any help 
is appreciated.  PLEASE e-mail, as I'm not on this list and only read the 
old archives.  Thanks in advance!!!!
