&gt;&gt;Maybe it was the word volatile that tripped you up. Seriously there is
&gt;&gt;engine starter fluid in a spray can that is *volatile* but not necessarily
&gt;&gt;explosive. This is ideal for finding leaks in manifolds especially with FI
&gt;&gt;systems. The technique was used by both VW mechanics in the bay area when
&gt;&gt;we had the engine checked out and I have also used it. I would not
&gt;&gt;recommend liberal doses nor spraying on the exhaust manifold. Your two
&gt;&gt;other options are: a) using a long hose and &quot;listening&quot; for leaks as you pass
&gt;&gt;the hose around the  engine compartment (I also use this to tune dual
&gt;&gt;carbs by listenting to the pitch of each carb). The hose isolates your ear
&gt;&gt;from other engine noise; b) random tightening down and replacement of
&gt;&gt;hoses - good luck - DC

If a particular area is suspected to be leaking this starter spray is indeed
an ideal way to identify the leak. AS long as the amount of spray is small
and away from ignition and exhaust areas it is probably not going to catch
fire. Spraying water, as mentioned by Dean, is probably a good idea to trying
to identify the leak area. Starter spray is then used to narrow down to where
exactly the leak is. Humm... should have learned these net wisdom earlier.
