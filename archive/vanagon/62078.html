Subject: Gas tank leak

Well, I think my tank has sprung a leak.
I filled my 84 up with gas on saturday night, went and paid the bill and 
when I walked back to the van, gas is dripping from the tank.
I looked underneath and gas was dripping from the back end of the tank, 
in the middle.  I looked like the gas was dripping down from the top of 
the tank as well.

Guesses on the source?  I was sure it was a leak on the top of the tank, 
until I read the archives and guess it could also be a hose fitting on the 
top of the tank.

What to do?  I suppose the thing to do is wait till the tank is near 
empty and take the tank off and take a look.  Is this a big enough pain 
that I will want to have spare gaskets to put on when I take the tank off?

If the tank has a hole, has anyone had the tank succesfully patched by 
welding?  How much should I expect to pay for a new/used tank?

Thanks in advance

Blake
