Subject: RE: Shifter Jams--Thanks, Richard!&quot;

Well my shifter ball that pops out of the linkage cup problem is 
solved--thanks, Richard.  I read your response on Sunday night and the ball 
popped out Monday morning on my way to work.  I didn't have the 1&quot; washers 
but I did have a 1&quot; nut that was about 1/4&quot; thick in my toolbox.  It works 
fine now--can't even *make* it jam if I wanted it to.  Thanks again.
