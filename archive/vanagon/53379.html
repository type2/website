Subject: Re: How to remover pistons from wasserboxer?


&gt; I have the engine cases unbolted but can't see how to get the pistons or 
&gt; rods out to seperate the cases. If this involves removing the piston 
&gt; pins, what is the best way to get very dirty pins out?
&gt; 

Well Bentley details a reamer to remove crud and a number of special 
pullers that I don't readily see how you could do without due to the 
damn water jacket.  Anybody with easy suggestions would sure be 
appreciated.

For parts Fast German Auto (advertises in A/C mags) seems to offer
kits, bearing, pistons, liners etc in the $650 range if I recall but 
I can't find any ads around.
