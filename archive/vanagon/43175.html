Subject:       Stoopid Parts Stores [f]

I LOVE parts stores that tell you they have the part you're looking 
for and when you get CLEAR over there they really don't have it.  

Yeah I like that.

I also love parts stores that when you state you want a 1.5 pitch tap 
and you get over there they really don't have a 1.5, but rather a 1.25 
pitch tap and THEY JUST ASSUMED that I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT AND THAT I REALLY MEANT A 1.25 PITCH!!!

Yeah, I REALLY LIKE THAT!

*** RANT MODE OFF ***

I feel better now.
