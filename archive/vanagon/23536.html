Subject:       [F]riday Gripe.

So there I was, out on the freeway;
I drove fast, thus, I was not in my bus.
Ahead of me pulled onto the freeway;
Mr. Policeperson in his UHP Camaro.
Not that my tax money buying a Camaro is bad;
But what happens next gets me mad.

Mr. Policeperson pulls over a car.
For something or other, probably legit.
No this poem follows no rythm or rhyme.

It seems that EVERY TIME, without fail;
This happens to me.  
The person in front of me SLAMS ON HIS BRAKES.

Why in the hell do you slam on your brakes!?!?
When the police officer is stopped on the side of the road!??!

So I rant and I rave, and I pass this bufoon.
Only to get stuck behind the truck in the fast lane.

Such _is_ life in the fast lane...
