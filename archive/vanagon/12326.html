Subject: RE: Broken Speedo

Only thing unique is that the speedo went too -- usually just the odo dies.
My experience -- and other posts -- indicate that only VDO speedo repair
places can get the parts, so it doesn't matter how easy or hard it is.
I've seen speedos in wrecking yards priced from $10 to $180, so shopping
is definitely in order.
Good luck!
