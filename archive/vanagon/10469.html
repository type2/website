So DerekDrew_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; Joel suggests that I might want to replace my fuel filter if I ran gas with
&gt; water in it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Why?
&gt; 
&gt; Does the water sit in there or wouldn't it just come out eventually?
&gt; 
&gt; Does the water somehow ruin the fuel filter?
&gt; 
&gt; Derek
&gt; 


I'm not sure I'd replace the fuel filter.  First, because they're so
damn expensive.  Second, I would think that the engine would just
burn off the moisture.  And any particles associated with the water
would/should be trapped in the porous material in the filter.  

Am I missing something?  Joel?  Anybody?
