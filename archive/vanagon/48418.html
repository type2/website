Subject: Dust in engine area - can I reduce it?

Lately, as the camping areas around here fill up, we've been moving further 
away into the woods to find some privacy. Around here, that means 
logging roads, which means *dust* (in the summer anyway). I mean 
*real* dust - last time out the back bumper had 3/8&quot; of dust after 2 
hours of driving.

What I'm not crazy about is the amount of dust covering the engine 
area. Is there anyone way to reduce this without affecting cooling, 
or is the best idea to just degrease the engine regularly?
