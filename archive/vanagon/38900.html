Subject: Update: Nudist Goat Farmer's 59 Panel

Hi All,

After nearly 3 years of doing nothing with my 59 Panel and its 1/3 welded 
on roof, I finally took a day off from work and finished the welding.  
This Panel was found at a nudist goat farmer's place about 5 years ago.  
It had been sitting since 1968 under a cottonwood tree that had deposited 
many large limbs on it (see at the techie ftp site if it's still around: 
jc59panl.gif).  Anyways the dents in the roof led to a roof that was 
beyond repair and a fairly virgin body.  I meticulously removed the roof 
from the drip edge up and did the opposite on a 67 Bus.  The two mated 
pretty well and on the back part I was able to mig weld up the old spot 
weld holes from the bottom up.  It worked out okay, esp. knowing that the 
whole thing will never be perfect. Maybe soon I'll have a runing, 
licensed Splittie to drive to Buses by the Arch!  Wishful thinking, but 
who knows?  8-)
