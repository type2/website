Subject: cc'ing the heads

Well I finished cc'ing the heads.  I had to fabricate a plastic disc 
to cover the deck volume to measure the chamber volume.  I took a 
peice of scrap &quot;250&quot; (1/4 inch) plaxiglass and turned it on a lathe 
such that the diameter was close to 94 mm.  I also took and end mill 
and made a counter bore in the center to accommodate a syringe 
septum.  This turned out to be too excessive. I found that air 
exchange is better facilitated without the septum in place.  I coated 
the deck face with a thin layer of petroleum jelly and layed the 
plexiglass chamber cover over it.  This fits snug, but not tight.  I 
carefully measured 20 cc (mLs) of distilled water ('cause I had some) 
and injected this into the center port of the cover.  I did this 
again.  (total of 40 mLs).  Using a finer-scaled syringe with a 
needle (curved to 90 degrees) I carefully injected water until there 
was no water trapped beneath the cover.  The results for the four 
chambers:

48.8, 49.4, 49.6, and 49.0 mLs.

Next Step, pull engine, remove old heads, estimate deck volume and 
calculate compression ratio....
