Subject:      Re: Vanagon Ignition Timing

Advancing the timing this way causes two problems.  You increase the
possibility of engine knock and you also increase the production of NOx.  VW
sets the timing to reduce the &quot;Peak Flame Temperature&quot;  and uses the 3-way cat
to control this most harmful emission.  This is the emission that the EPA
tried to monitor with centralized emissions testing.  It is only produced when
an engine is under load.  Hence, the need for a chassis dyno or test equipment
that can be carried in the car.  We will probably be getting this in New York.
 Most other car manufacturers use an EGR valve for this purpose.  VW chose to
save money as we don't need the performance,(ha).  The other concern, is that
with the timing advanced, less air is needed to maintain a set idle speed.
This raises CO and HC emissions drastically.  If the cat is working, you may
not see this, but measure the emissions before the cat and you'll be amazed.
Especially during warm-up.  In my experience, at least 7 out of 10 Vanagons
that come to me with a marginal failure can be corrected by properly setting
the timing and idle speed.  To set the timing properly on the 2.1 liter
engine, all you need to do is disconnect the temp. sensor for the computer.
This will cause the timing to default to its baseline setting.  When done,
reconnect the sensor, shut- off and restart the engine and you should be set.

Hope this helps,
Dennis.

PS.  I have written a coupe of articles on Emissions systems,  if anyone is
interested, I can E-mail them to you.
