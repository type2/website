Subject: Travel Eqpt. Co. in Elkhart, Ind. conversions????

 Howdy there. My newly acquired '67 camper was converted by Travel Equipment
Corporation, out of Elkhart, Indiana. I was just wondering if anyone had heard
of them, and/or seen any other conversions. It's not a bad job, but I do want
to replace the bed and rear cabinet with a Westy bed, (anyone got one?) because
the one in there is pretty rickety.
Anyway, thanks, just wondering...
