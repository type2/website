Subject:  Sucker for the '57 23-Window!

Well friends...

I bought the '57!!!  It is beautiful.  I was told the paint needed to be
redone, but it is acutally in good shape.  The paint job is the original
colors, Chocolate Brown on the top, and Salmon on the bottom.  It looks
fabulous!  It has the jail-bars and everything.  The roof-liner doesn't have
a single tear in it!  Wow.  And the canvas sunroof is in good shape.  It even
has a new '67 tranny with the high gear ratio!  Has all the chrome!  And
bumper guards!

Only major drawbacks:  It does have an engine, allbeit blown up.   
                       The driver rear conrner window is cracked!!!  ACK.  A
                       guy will sell me one for $100!?  Is that outrageous?
                       I know you can't buy them from aftermarket places!
                       Ouch!
                       It is missing the chrome for the engine vents.  Anyone
                       know where to get this stuff?

So.  I am extremely happy today!
