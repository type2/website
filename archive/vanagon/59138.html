Subject: Dash blower install...

I will be helping a friend of mine install the dash htr/def. blower assembly
in his '80 Vanagon kombi  ASI Camper.  Obviously since it is a kombi, it
didn't have the blower.
I have stripped a few vanagons in the past and have removed the dash blowers,
but have always destroyed the dash in the process, since that was the easiest
way to get them out, and they were just vans that were getting junked that I
didn't give a hooty hoo about. 
Is there something in the archives, or does someone know of a easy way to
remove and replace the dash without destroying it?
Also, has anyone else with a Vanagon kombi (yeah, all 2 of you :&lt;)
retrofitted a dash blower into your dash? 
Is the wiring for the fan already there?

TIA,
chris
