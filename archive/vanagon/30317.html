Subject: Alternator &amp; O2 lights on

Yesterday, my wife was driving the Vanagon when the O2 light and
the Alternator light came on. She stopped and restarted the Vanagon
and the lights stayed on.

She now knows that when red lights are on, the vehicle must not
be driven. (Some of you may remember our broken fan belts, &quot;But
I thought I could make it home&quot; saga from the beginning of the 
summer.) 

So she called and I go pick her up. Quick check of the engine
shows no broken belts, nothing apparently wrong that I can see.

I started it and the two lights stay on. I let it idle for about 
a minute and I felt I could drive it the three miles home. Drive 
out of the parking lot and the lights go out. Hmm, that's interesting.

We make it home and eat dinner. I was perusing the wiring schematic
and see that there appears to be a common circuit to the OXS/CAT
elapsed mile counter. Maybe a short in this area?

I drove the Vanagon around the block after dinner. It had the 2 lights 
on when I started but they went out after a minute. This morning, I 
started it and the lights were not on.

Has anyone seen or experienced these symptoms? Answers and insights
are certainly appreciated.

Oh, I last reset the OXS milage counter at 94K miles, there are now 
117K on the van.
