Subject: Cold Starting tricks

Since it decided to hit -12 here in Denver over the weekend and since my
83 van has a problem with the starter solonid not engaging I took some
of the list information to help the situation. I took a small electric
heater and put it in the back of the van over the open engine
compartment. After heatin for 1 hour the starter engaged and the van
started.
In line with that what is the thought on heating the solonoid,
accessable from the engine compartment vs beating the hell out of it. I
realize changing the starter is an option but not at -10 to 0 degrees,
plus the local import parts house doesn't have one in stock ($138.50
exch.)
