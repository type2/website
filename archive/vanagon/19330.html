&gt; Next time you change your tranny lube, try nuking the lube before you pump
&gt; it.  Heats up a treat and goes through the pump like water.
&gt; 

Alternate tip: sit containers in hot water for a while, then use a
peristaltic pump (borrowed from the lab. Use a good big one with variable
speed, ie Watson-Marlow) to fill tranny. When I did this, its was so
relaxed an event that I could stand back and have a beer while the tranny
was filling.
