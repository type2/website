Subject: Re: axles r off...

Sean:
I'll start at splitting the reduction gear housing.  What follows is
how I did it...
Loosen the bolts around the RG housing by doing every other one until their
all loose.  Mine were not torqued dowm too tight and felt similar to the nuts 
holding the axle flange to the transaxle (suggested torque of 18 ft lbs). 
So their not going to be very tight.  Take these bolts all the way out.  To
separate, gently tap with a screwdriver on opposite ends on areas that offer
a surface that extends beyond the mating interface. I don't recommend prying
the halves apart by inserting a screw driver (or like instrument) in between
the housing.  Take your time, as the bearings are helping to keep these halves
together.  It'll come apart.  Some of the oil remaining in the casing will 
flow out - so be prepared. Once the housing's separated you will need to 
remove the upper outer bearing inorder to remove the axle.  Mine was retained
by a circlip (on earlier models I think the bearings were pressed in and did
not have this circlip).  If yours has a circlip-great!  You'll need a circlip
plier to get this off.  Once the circlip is removed, the bearing needs to be
pulled off.  These are on tight be not too tight.  I monkeyed around abit with
a couple of pieces of nylon strapping (about 1/2&quot;) wide which I worked behind
the bearing on each side of the shaft. I used this to try pull the bearing. 
This was tough going, and reluctantly I ended up using two screwdrivers 
(ends covered with rags) and SLOWLY, gently pried while frequently rotating
the bearing.  This worked as the bearing slid to the outer end of the bearing.
The next thing is to remove the reduction drive gear.  This just slides off.
To remove the axle from the tube/inner RG housing/inner gear assembly, I used
a block of wood and tapped on the outer part of the axle while holding the
tube assembly up.  A few taps with a hammer on the block and the axle was
freed from the inner bearing.
	I am just replacing the upper two bearings.  Their costs plus shipping
(next day air) from RMMW was $36.  This is for just one side.  Because of the
lack of bread I'm just doing the one side.  The other looks and feels like the
bearings are good.  I definitely can feel the difference.  I'm not even 
tackling the lower driven gear assembly.  If you need to replace this bearing
(i.e., the +$40 one you mentioned) it is necessary to gain access through a
plug in the rear RG housing.  My manual (Brooklands) suggest consulting a
VW agent.
	To remove the axle from the transaxle is quite easy.  The axles are
held internally by an internal circlip.  Loosen boots and axle tube retainer
(axle flange).  Remove circlip and rotate circlip and thrust washer from
side gear and slide down the axle.  The axle now pulls out as does (separately)
the side gear assemble.  Be careful not to loose the fulcrum plates in the
side gear.  Check your manual for clearence (Clarence) between the axle shaft
and fulcrum plates.  
Hope this helps...
