Subject: Mexican Busses

Hey now,
        I've got a friend who's very interested in the possibility of
scoring a mexican bus. He's got a family member that owns a condo in
Cancun, so he has an address for registration. So does anyone have any info
on the legalities of mexican registration? Doe the registrant have to be a
mexican citizen, or is an address all that's needed? Will he encounter
problems at the border, or in town (really officer, it's my Uncle's
bus...)?
        Anyone have any idea about what the mexican busses run for-either
in pesos or dollars(I can convert)? Any help is appreciated-&amp; if it works
for him, I might just be interested in doing it.

Peace,
