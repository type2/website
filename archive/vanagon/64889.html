Subject:      Hesitation

While driving at around 110 km/hr, the 82 Westfalia had a series of short
(1-2 sec.) hesitations, lasting around 5-8 seconds, as if there was no gas
getting through.  This repeated again about 10 minutes later, but these
were the only occurrances in the 3 hour drive.

Any ideas?  Is this is sign of bad things to come?

Thanks for any help.
