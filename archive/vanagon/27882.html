Subject: It won't even start.


Hi,
I have an 87 syncro van that has a slight starting problem (this is 
different from my previous post about cold starting, although this problem 
only happens on the first start of the day)

Some mornings I will go to start my van and almost nothing happens.....The 
dashboard idiot lights come on thru their built in test, and i hear a slight 
hum from the engine compartment, but no cranking of the starter.  I'll turn 
the key all the way off and back on and sometimes it will crank and start 
after a slight hesitation, other times nothing.  When nothing happens I just 
go back to the engine compartment and wiggle all the connectors and find 
none loose and tap all the black boxes.  Then, magically, it starts!

WHATSUPWITDAT?

thanks,
Fred Porter
