Subject: Re: Competent engine replacement in N. VA

We have a mechanic in Northern Virginia that we have used for years.  He's
Austrian and runs a very professional shop.  He's been very honest with us
and we've been really pleased with his work.  The only drawback is that he
sometimes takes trips to visit Austria, and although he has competent workers
in his shop we always make sure he is there to look at it if it is a major
problem.  His name is Laslo.
