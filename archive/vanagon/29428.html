&gt;While searching for tires in Vancouver I came across the following 
&gt;excellent deals.
&gt;
&gt;Continental Transport - New - $60 each installed.  Graysons Tire at 
&gt;Main and 2nd.
&gt;
&gt;Woosung (???) - New - $79 installed.  Econo-Tire in North Vancouver.
&gt;
&gt;I purchased the Woosung for the front two tires on my Westfalia and 
&gt;it feels like I've got power steering now!  Also I don't slide across 
&gt;three lanes anymore when it rains here, which is quite frequently.  
&gt;The Woosungs seem to have a half decent tread which might even be an 
&gt;all season capable tire.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone got a recommendation on a snow tire for my bus for when 
&gt;skiing starts?  I would like to find something somewhat reasonably
&gt;priced and somewhat durable also ( cake and eat it too.)
&gt;
&gt;You'll all also be happy to know that I brought back a personalized 
&gt;'ELVIS' license plate from Nevada.  Another cheesy souvenir for the 
&gt;Vanagon.  Now if only I could find those mud flaps which have the 
&gt;chrome lady on them - you know the ones the truckers have? (insert 
&gt;sarcasm here)

What do you mean &quot;when the skiing starts&quot;?  I've been 3 times already.
