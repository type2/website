Subject: Re: Hes..Hes..Hesitation Problems

&gt;on my '71 
&gt;bus. It runs fine except when I first start to press the gas coming out 
&gt;of a dead stop and shifting gears I get a hesitation and then it kicks in. 
&gt;I've set the timing,put a new fuel filter on, adjusted the points, and think 
&gt;I've adjsuted the fuel screw correctly. Could my my problem be in the 
&gt;vacum  lines?

You _could_ have a vacuum leak, how successful have you been adjusting the 
carb?  Are you running the stock 34-PICT-3?

I've been twinking with my 71 for about 9 mos now, just recently replaced the 
carb (still a 34-PICT-3).  I now am happy.

Prior to this I've played around with all the settings, tried different 
distributors, even replaced the intake manifold (suspecting clogged heat 
riser).  The 24-year-old Solex turned out to be the demon, partly due to its 
age and partly its design making it susceptible to this problem.  Which brings 
up my next point, don't bother rebuilding the 34.  Buy a new one if you decide 
to go this way.  $120.

Like I said, after 9 mos. of frustration, I'm happy with mine now...
