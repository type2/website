Subject: Re: poptop gasket

Bruce and listees,

I bought and installed the aftermarket replacement gasket from BusBoys
and am very happy with it.  The old one will just keep getting worse and
worse.

&gt;         The rubber gasket on the poptop of my '84 Westy has started to
&gt; droop. The loose area has grown from about six inches to 18 inches in the
&gt; span of a month. I need to stop procrastinating and do something quick.
&gt;         I'm trying to decide whether I should: 1) try to glue the offending
&gt; area back up with the thought that the rest of it will remain intact; or 2)
&gt; punt and buy a replacement now.
&gt;         Any suggestions from volks who have been in the same situation?
