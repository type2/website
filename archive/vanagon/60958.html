Subject: How to change ATF in 90 Vanagon

Anyone know what interval you are suppost to change the tranny fluid in a
90 vanagon with automatic transmission?

I can't find any reference to frequency of ATF change in my owners manual
or Bentley.  I also can't find any info in Bentley as to how to go about
it.  Is there a filter to change?  Does the pan have to be dropped?  There
is no drain plug, right?
