So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, but this song has been in my head for well over a week, and its time 
&gt; to get it out!  It goes to the tune of that ridiculous song about leaving
&gt; a cake in the rain, blah blah blah.
&gt; 
&gt; {
&gt; Someone left the bus out - in the rain,
&gt; and I don't think I can take it,
&gt; cause the seals they didn't make it,
&gt; and I don't wanna clean that mess up, again!!!!!! 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh no!!!!!
&gt; }
&gt; 

Thom,

I suggest you check your self into the nearest mental hospital.  You've
definately gone off the deep end!  ;)
