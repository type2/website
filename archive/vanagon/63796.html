&lt;&lt; Carter does know their VW Vanagons. They also know just how much $$ they
 can get away with charging for used ones. When I was first looking for a
 Westie I spent some time in their lots but the sticker shock almost sent
 me into a coma. But I digress. &gt;&gt;


Right on!!!

When I decided to look for a Syncro Westy, I contacted Carter Motors and
asked them to notify me when they found another one.   They called me to look
at a 90 coming in from Florida with 68,000 miles.  I asked them how much they
would be asking for it and they said &quot;about $25,500&quot;.   I was shocked, but
they said they would have no problem getting it from someone else if I wasn't
interested, and appearantly they got what they asked for it.

It took a year, but I found my '87 at a dealer in Corvallis, Oregon for
$14,500.

However, there is a place called Woodinville Automotive near Seattle, that
searches the U.S. for Vanagon Westies and will do a custom search for a
Syncro if you have the bucks.  They quoted less money than Carter VW, but if
you really need one and don't have the resources or time to find one, they
could come in handy:
