Subject: re: 87 HELP

Hi to all--

Well, in regards to my horrible loss of power problems that I already
posted, so far so good with the new coolant temp. sensor.  I have driven
the van twice, first a relatively short 50 mi. round trip, second
approx. 140 mi. round trip.  Both times, all went well.  However, in the
past year, I've had periods of up to 3 weeks of good operation.  Thus,
I'm holding out on a final verdict until Christmas!  I'll update
everyone one way or the other by then.

Thanks everyone for all of your help!!
