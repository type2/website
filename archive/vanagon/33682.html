How long has this '62 been sitting?  If you've been driving it around then
use a bigger screwdriver (or pry bar). You can also use a screwdriver to
pry the end of the shoe up and out of the adjuster  (my favorite solution).
The spring should pull it all the way back from the drum.  The drum will
come off and you can clean the crud out of the adjuster's hole and
reposition the shoe.  If the bus has been sitting around for a few years
that's a different problem requiring a different solution.  Good luck!

&gt;Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt;1962 Kombi
&gt;
&gt;I got the rear hub/axle nuts undone, but the hubs won't come off because the
&gt;brake adjusters are seized up, I can't slacken the brakes off enough...
&gt;
&gt;The adjusters are soaking in WD-40 overnight &amp; I'll try with a bigger
&gt;screwdriver tomorrow (my cheapo one bent like toffee on them). In the meantime,
&gt;any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Also, anyone in the UK know of a good, fast mail-order place that stock '62
&gt;brake parts? All VW shops in Bristol say pre-'64 is too old for them to get.
&gt;
&gt;Also, what's the correct pressure for the tyres?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Sarah
