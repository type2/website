1974 Westfalia VW camper van for sale. 

Orange and beige paint, with orange canvas (canvas has a few small tears, 
easily patched).  20# propane tank (vented) and 5000 BTU propane catalytic 
heater.  Sink and icebox.  4 speaker, AM/FM cassette.  Upholstered seat/ 
storage box between front seats.  Body is in good condition.  Booster 
springs in front and rear.  Orange privacy curtains all the way around. 

I have a dash clock that I will install, and it will have new inspection 
stickers this month.  

150,000 miles, with an engine rebuild. 

Single carbeuretor 1700cc engine (the hard-to-sychronize dual carbs were 
replaced).  Runs like a champ! 

My wife and I have had this camping several times this year; we just want 
to upgrade to a newer Vanagon model. 

I know the previous owner paid $3000 for this about 3 years ago, so let's 
start the price discussions there.  I've only put about 2000 miles on it 
since I got it, and I've done a lot of work to it (I installed the stereo, 
the sink/icebox, the jump seat, the front booster springs, an ignition 
switch, a speedometer cable, etc.). 

Thanks, 
--Dale
