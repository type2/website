Subject: Re: question about van shopping

&gt;
&gt;I'm in the market for a used Vanagon, which will be my first, and I have 
&gt;a couple of questions for you seasoned veterans: 

OK

&gt;1) I can spend $5000 including tax. Do you think I'll be able to find a 
&gt;van that feels new to me, is an '86 or newer, and has &lt;100 K miles?
&gt;

YES

&gt;2) Would it be better to buy one with a rebuilt engine or at least the 
&gt;heads redone, assuming that it usually needs to be done somewhere around 
&gt;100.000 miles?  Or if it has had this work done is it a sign the little 
&gt;pup has been driven too hot and other things will go wrong?
&gt;
a)GO FOR LOW MILES, AND SAVE FOR THE INEVITABLE.
b)NOT ABSOLUTELY

&gt;3) I heard there is no &quot;Idiots Guide&quot; for the Vanagon-is this true? I had 
&gt;one for a Rabbit and for a Toyota truck and I saved myself big bucks with 
&gt;the easy instructions.  
&gt;

YES, BENTLEYS GUIDE

&gt;4) Lastly, does anyone have Vanagon to sell me that is within a couple 
&gt;hours of Seattle?  
&gt;

IF YOU TRAVEL  BY CONCORDE, THEN MINE IS AVAILABLE ON THE EAST COAST!


&gt;Thanks!! 
&gt;
SORRY, NOT MUCH TO THANK ME FOR.     tim s.
