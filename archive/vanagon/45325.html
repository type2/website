&gt; Possible solutions:
     &lt;snip&gt;

You forgot:


* Park it under an avalanche. (free but voids warrantee)

* Put one of those curved carnival mirrors in front of it, so it looks
  lower when you sit in the driver's seat (free unless you get caught
  stealing mirror)

* Fill it with oak firewood ($100/cord)

* Lease it out to Steven Spielberg for next &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; movie
  (they'll pay you, maybe)


In the spirit of helping a fellow VW'er...   ;^)
