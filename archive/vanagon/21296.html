Subject: Re: Power Brake Booster 71 Bus

Thanks to all who replied with advice on resurrecting my power brakes.  

For replacing the godawfully expensive VW power brake vacuum hose,  Eugene
suggested neoprene hose as a cheaper alternative and someone said they used
heater hose with no ill collapsing effect.  I looked around at my FLAPS and
found out that 'round these parts the neoprene hose is special order.  Gates
makes a &quot;light duty&quot; 1/2&quot; or so inner diameter hose for $2.70/foot packaged
in 3 ft quantities.  You can buy larger quantities (over 3ft) cut to order
at only $1.75/foot.  It doesn't have the nice woven cover and wire wrapped
around it like the old VW stuff, but it is THICK and looks like it will do
the job.

A new booster from VW (211 612 103) goes for $400+!!  Someone mentioned a
place that might sell rebuilt units for $125 (but I'm still waiting for
address/phone info hint, hint).  The concensus is to get a good cheap unit
at a junkyard.

Also, I looked at the fiche at the dealership and discovered that the
protective rubber bellows that covers the vent side of the booster is no
longer available. I don't really need one, but this seems like a part that
should be reproduced somewhere (WCM?).

The check valve is still available from the dealer, as someone pointed out,
for $12.

Thanks again.  Looking forward to that feeling of power!
