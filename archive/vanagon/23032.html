Subject: '71 bus, camshaft prob. diagnosed?
Date: Fri, 18 Aug 1995 15:21:29 -0400 (EDT)

Problem diagnosed but not solved yet... opinions requested...

My problem was that after installing a new camshaft and turning it with the
crankshaft, there were 'tight spots'.  The camshaft would lift out of the 
bearings a bit even while rotating the engine _forward_.  I noticed that 
there were marks on the new camshaft near the front edge on several teeth 
in two different areas. These areas were 180 degrees apart.  I replaced 
the old crankshaft and the same story.  I switched them back and forth a 
few times and realized that if I lined up the dots on the shafts properly 
on the OLD shaft, the assembly would turn SMOOTHLY.  Put back the new 
camshaft, lined up the dots,  the assemlbly would turn ROUGHLY. Put back 
the old camshaft, DON'T line up the dots, the assembly would run 
ROUGHLY.  OK, you get the pattern?.

Very close examination of the crankshaft timing gear revealed a very 
subtle widening of teeth on the front ends of the teeth, corresponding to 
the marks on the camshaft. Could it be that the last rebuilder of the 
engine hammered the timing gear onto the crankshaft and flattened the 
edges of the teeth just enough to ruin my life for a few days?  It could 
not have been me or the mechanic who pressed it on for me
or it would have had tight spots on both camshafts in all situations.

I _know_ I should take the crankshaft back to the shop and have a new timing
gear pressed on...BUT I am in a desparate hurry.  We are trying to sell our
house, and the realtor tells my wife that the two old dirty buses completely
filling the garage MUST go, even if it means putting them in storage!  
Neither buses run. The engine is somewhat of a Muldoon anyway, the 
crankcase was borderline as was the crankshaft.

Can I go with the tight spots and hope that they 'wear in'???

(I _promise_ to do the next one 'right'! :-))  I need to get 10 or 20 K 
on this engine.

Thanks for any input, and thanks to Veeduber Bob for the _many_ 
paragraphs of help.

Mitch
