Q:  How many internet mail list subscribers does it take
 &gt;&gt;       to change a Vanagon taillight bulb?
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;   A:  1,331:
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;           1 to change the light bulb and to post to the mail
 &gt;&gt;             list that the light bulb has been changed
 &gt;&gt;          14 to share similar experiences of changing light
 &gt;&gt;             bulbs and how the light bulb could have been
 &gt;&gt;             changed differently.
 &gt;&gt;          7 to caution about the dangers of changing light bulbs.
 &gt;&gt;         27 to point out spelling/grammar errors in posts about
 &gt;&gt;            changing light bulbs.
 &gt;&gt;         53 to flame the spell checkers
 &gt;&gt;        156 to write to the list administrator complaining about
 &gt;&gt;            the light bulb discussion and its inappropriateness
 &gt;&gt;            to this mail list.
 &gt;&gt;        41 to correct spelling in the spelling/grammar flames.
 &gt;&gt;        109 to post that this list is not about light bulbs and
 &gt;&gt;            to please take this email exchange to alt.lite.bulb
 &gt;&gt;        203 to demand that cross posting to alt.grammar,
 &gt;&gt;            alt.spelling and alt.punctuation about changing
 &gt;&gt;            light bulbs be stopped.
 &gt;&gt;        111 to defend the posting to this list saying that we
 &gt;&gt;            all use light bulbs and therefore the posts
 &gt;&gt;            **are** relevant to this mail list.
 &gt;&gt;        306 to debate which method of changing light
 &gt;&gt;            bulbs is superior, where to buy the best light bulbs,
 &gt;&gt;            what brand of light bulbs work best for this
 &gt;&gt;            technique, and what brands are faulty.
 &gt;&gt;         27 to post URLs where one can see examples of
 &gt;&gt;            different light bulbs
 &gt;&gt;         14 to post that the URLs were posted incorrectly, and
 &gt;&gt;            to post corrected URLs.
 &gt;&gt;          3 to post about links they found from the URLs that
 &gt;&gt;            are relevant to this list which makes light bulbs
 &gt;&gt;            relevant to this list.
 &gt;&gt;         33 to concatenate all posts to date, then quote
 &gt;&gt;            them including all headers and footers, and then
 &gt;&gt;            add &quot;Me Too.&quot;
 &gt;&gt;         12 to post to the list that they are unsubscribing
 &gt;&gt;            because they cannot handle the light bulb
 &gt;&gt;            controversy.
 &gt;&gt;         19 to quote the &quot;Me Too's&quot; to say, &quot;Me Three.&quot;
 &gt;&gt;          4 to suggest that posters request the light bulb FAQ.
 &gt;&gt;          1 to propose new alt.change.lite.bulb newsgroup.
 &gt;&gt;         47 to say this is just what alt.physic.cold_fusion
 &gt;&gt;            was meant for, leave it here.
 &gt;&gt;        143 votes for alt.lite.bulb.
