To which I reply:

AAARRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!

We're in the process of converting our network address to a new set of
numbers, for various reasons that I don't feel like going into at the
moment.  So far, everything's been fairly transparent.  However, it
looks like it's broken our web server pretty severely.

The underlying problem is that the server depends on being able to
translate what address you used to contact it back into a host name,
so it knows what part of our file archive to show you.  Unfortunately,
the one thing that isn't working yet (because it depends on people
outside of our control to do something) is the mapping from address to
name for the new network addresses.  Thus, the server can't do the
translation, and therefore doesn't know where to find the file you
asked for.

This is two problems:  the lack of ability to translate, and poor
error recovery on the part of our server.  I'll try to get the latter
fixed ASAP, definitely by tomorrow.  The former I can't really do
anything about, unfortunately....

My apologies for the inconvenience.
