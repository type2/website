Ohhhhhh... I'd just LOVE to have a 20 year old Transit.

When I was young, I had to get up half an hour before sunrise,
lick the cesspool clean with me tongue...nail a set of wooden
wheels to my feet and skate four hours up hill to work....

Then nail the wheels to my head, because my feet were broken
up, coast down hill to home, which was a torn up paper
bag, and my dad would beat me about the head and body
with a 2x4 while singing &quot;Kliener GTI&quot;...


Ric .... with appologies to Monty Python
