Subject: Re: Trip Report: Bay area and beyond

me&gt; sending off these trip reports. The camp hosts, Mr. and Mrs. have
me&gt; generously agreed to let us use the ranger's telephone to connect
me&gt; to AOL and
     Whoops!! That should've read Mr. and Mrs. Steve and Jean Fuller-drop by
and see 'em up at Stillwater Cove campground if you can, there here 'till the
end of September.
Peace,
Eddie
