Subject: 87: coolant temp sensor for syncro
Date: Fri, 7 Jun 1996 14:50:21 -0700

I'm having a difficult time finding a replacement for the coolant temp 
sensor on my '87 syncro. The VW part (025 906 041-A) doesn't fit my rig. It 
appears that I have a slightly different thermostat housing. The standard 
part is larger in diameter and is held in with a clip. My part screws into 
the housing. I've talked to two dealers and one reputable shop and nobody 
has seen this situation before. The part number on my part appears to a be 
Bosch part number, it is 0 280 130 026. Anyone encounter this before? Any 
idea why my syncro would be unique? One strange clue is on page 24.49 of 
Bentley where there is a diagram of how the sensor fits into the thermostat 
housing. It says the retaining spring is not used on syncro vehicles. This 
implies that syncros have a different sensor and thermostat housing. But 
everyone tells me this is not so.
