Subject:      FFFriday Follies Failure??? :(


hear i sit, all down-hearted,
'tis Friday, and i can't get started,
a story, joke, an ode or pome
i need to write, a little tome
of wit or wisdom, mirth or glee,
but nothing bubbles up from me.

am i so burned from Friday's past
that nothing's left in me at last?
no more lame verse to mock our cars?
no stupid songs unheard in bars?
with wrinkled forehead o'er mine eyes,
my tortured mind doth seek the prize.

a silly song? no, not again.
a sonnet, then, from way back when?
an ode, perhaps? nah, that's too long;
you're better off with silly song.
oh, fuddled mind! am i too beat?
is nothing left that ain't repeat??

oh, well, it's not the worldwide end ...
i guess, next Friday, try again
to see if verse or song is writ
continuing this Friday shit
of Folly Funnies on the List ...
and hope today it won't be missed.

unca joel :)
