Subject: Want to buy a EV/MV like mine??


Ok for all of those who were drooling over the prospect of buying my EV this 
summer (when I was suffering from Synchro-envy), my local dealer has a 1993 
White EV/MV like mine for sale. It has the table, the rear facing seats, 
ABS, etc...etc...about 55K miles. The dealer wants $14,900 for it...and I 
know they usually inflate their prices about $1k or $1.5k or so...

If you are interested its at Pearson-Miller VW, Rt6, North Dartmouth, MA
(508) 999-4573...ask for Ken.
