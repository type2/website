Subject: Re: '56 kombi - new security system

Thom, I had a similar problem with my '65 micro a while back, except that I had 
to turn the lights on to start it. Sometimes, once it was running I could turn 
them off (Never did try flashing them....). Othertimes it died when I turned off
the lights. (Kind of a cool way to kill the ignition)

I could never figure it out, and finally got pissed one day and rewired the 
whole section under the dash and into the fusebox. I didn't mess with the 
battery cables, just wires under the dash and behind the front kick panel (does 
'56 have kick panels?) Any that did it...problem gone.

-Erik.

&gt; &gt;I had the same problem in my '70, and it turned out to be a bad 
&gt; &gt;starter-battery cable--the cable had corroded out from within the plastic 
&gt; &gt;sheath, thus invisible.  Replaced it as well as both ground straps.  
&gt; &gt;Archetypal old-guy mechanic told me the headlights &quot;heated up&quot; the wires, 
&gt; &gt;allowing for greater conceptual continuity.  (OK, I made that last part 
&gt; &gt;up, but it did fix it)  
&gt; 
&gt; I already replaced both the + and - cables.  However, the cable that
&gt; goes up to the front is a little shaky looking.  Bit more of a job to
&gt; replace though :(
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if this cable being putzoid would have anything to do with the
&gt; previous problem, whereby the bus would cut out when I turned the
&gt; headlights on, _or_ I would be driving along and everything would just
&gt; die...
