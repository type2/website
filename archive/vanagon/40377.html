Subject: Oil in exhaust

I noticed sprinkles of oil exiting my exhaust pipe just the other day.  It
seems to only happen when the vehicle is cold.  The vehicle is a 1980
Vanagon, w/ a 2 bbl Weber.  Could the valves be maladjusted?  Whatever it is,
its probably expensive.  

The vehicle runs superbly, with the exception of a heavy appetite of engine
oil.


I would greatly appreciate your thoughts.

Stuart Bear
