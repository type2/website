Subject: Re: Help! Flashing Temperature LED

&gt;&gt; This morning it was colder than most (25=B0F). Starting my 88' Westy
&gt;&gt; (water-cooled) was no problem however the Temperature LED would not stop
&gt;&gt; flashing.

&gt; maybe your anti-freeze was frozen!

&gt; No-joke this happened to me!    Eric Zeno

Hmmmm, Eric, maybe you added a little too much of that &quot;Pbgh&quot; water..........
