&gt;Yes, why?? Is there a particular weakness and low survival rate with that
&gt;model year?

my personal feeling is that it was the first year of completely fuel injection
and people were somewhat leery of efi back then ... same thing with 1983
models: first year of water-cooled, and people just didn't buy them &lt;check
out the stats below&gt;:

  56 Microbus    1    68 Bus    4    80 Vanagon    8    92 Eurovan    1
  57 Microbus    0    69 Bus    4    81 Vanagon   12    93 Eurovan    8
  58 Microbus    2    70 Bus    9    82 Vanagon   15    94 Eurovan    0
  59 Microbus    4    71 Bus   15    83 Vanagon    3    95 Eurovan    1
  60 Microbus    2    72 Bus   10    84 Vanagon   11
  61 Microbus    3    73 Bus   11    85 Vanagon   18
  62 Microbus    2    74 Bus    5    86 Vanagon    7
  63 Microbus    1    75 Bus    4    87 Vanagon   12
  64 Microbus    4    76 Bus    6    88 Vanagon    4
  65 Microbus    1    77 Bus    4    89 Vanagon    5
  66 Microbus    8    78 Bus   10    90 Vanagon    9
  67 Microbus    6    79 Bus    5    91 Vanagon    5

nowever, if you notice, the 75's are not that much lower than 74 or 76 or 77.
and besides, we are dealing with a very skewed sample here: bus owners who
(1) have access to computers and internet, and (2) know about the list, and
(3) care enough (?) to stay on the list. ;)
now, having said that, check out these stats for ALL the buses i know about
(which is likely NOT all the buses out there) on the 'network':

  56 Microbus    1    68 Bus   12    80 Vanagon   14    92 Eurovan    1
  57 Microbus    1    69 Bus   11    81 Vanagon   15    93 Eurovan   13
  58 Microbus    3    70 Bus   24    82 Vanagon   28    94 Eurovan    0
  59 Microbus    5    71 Bus   36    83 Vanagon    6    95 Eurovan    1
  60 Microbus    2    72 Bus   17    84 Vanagon   16
  61 Microbus    3    73 Bus   31    85 Vanagon   28
  62 Microbus    5    74 Bus   15    86 Vanagon   13
  63 Microbus    2    75 Bus    6    87 Vanagon   21
  64 Microbus    7    76 Bus   17    88 Vanagon    7
  65 Microbus    5    77 Bus   16    89 Vanagon    8
  66 Microbus   16    78 Bus   23    90 Vanagon   14
  67 Microbus   19    79 Bus   15    91 Vanagon    6

here, the 75's low numbers are noticeable, as are the numbers for 1983.
but that doesn't explain the 88's and 89's and 91's.

i've tried to make some sense of it, and those model-change jitters are the
only thing i can come up with. but it doesn't explain all of the years that
are low.
