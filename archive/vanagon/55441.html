Subject: WTB: 86-91 Westy &lt; $5K

All,

Well, *sigh* it turns out that the Vanagon I was looking at isn't a full 
Westy, but instead a Weekender. I'm still looking at it, but what I 
*really* want is a 86-91 Westy. Doesn't matter if it's a syncro or not.
But it needs to have little/no rust and in generically good shape since 
it's going to be my daily driver for a few years yet.

I'm still in college and can't afford anything above $5K or so. I'd 
really appreciate offers (shyeah!) and pointers to some for sale, etc.

Thank you to all who sent material for the VW Win95 Theme!

- J
