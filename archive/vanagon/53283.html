Subject: Raceware Head Studs


Hi all,
	I have heard a lot about RACEWARE studs for the Wasserboxer heads.
Supposedly they have been able to stop the leaky head gasket syndrome.  If
(when) my heads start to weep I will try them.  But I was also wondering
if anyone out there has used these studs, and how well they worked?  Also
do you guys think that it would help to prevent/postpone the leaking if I
switched them out now?  TIA
