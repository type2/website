&gt; John Gladu asked about how to dispose of used coolant.  I encountered this
&gt; and called the wastewater people who do the Billings water.  At first the
&gt; guy wasn't sure whether there would be a problem or not, but that was when
&gt; he thought I might have a thousand gallons.  When I told him No, just a few
&gt; gallons, he said no problem, just pour it down the drain.  Anybody else
&gt; have experience on this?

Around here (Southern Calif) it is &quot;really really bad&quot;(tm) to pour anything
like anti-freeze down the drain, or on the ground.  Even the junkyards
have been forced by the state to provide pans to drain the stuff into in
the yards to protect the environment.  I always recycle it if it is
anything more than what gets spilled on the floor in the garage.
