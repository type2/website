Subject: taking the alternator out

Hi all,

Well, my alternator finally died.  It acted up a few months ago and
cleaning some contacts worked.  However, it is now putting out only 8
volts, so ...

Now I have not checked the regulator and brushes and that's my next
step.  But, it appears that I have to take the whole alternator out to
get that part off the back.  I could undo the top screw in the back, but
other things were blocking the other 2 screws.  So:

1)  Is there a simple way of removing the regulator/brushes without
removing the whole alternator?

2)  If not, or just incase they are fine and the alternator itself is
bad, What is the best way to remove the alternator?

Detailed instructions please, as you're dealing with a novice when it
comes to dissassembling!

Thanks!!
