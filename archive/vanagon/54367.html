&gt;Later, I purchased two tires at a &quot;reliable&quot; Goodyear dealer. It was not
&gt;until AFTER the tires had been mounted on rims that the dealer-person
&gt;told me they did not have the equipment to balance the tires.
&gt;
&gt;I'm now searching the are for some firm/entity with the equipment get
&gt;the tires balanced.

J.C. Whitney sells an adapter that allows older VW wheels with the giant
hole in the center to be mounted/balanced on modern equipment.
