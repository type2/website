&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a virus on America Online being sent by 
&gt;E-Mail. If you get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anything called &quot;Good Times&quot;, DON'T read it or 
&gt;download it.  It is a virus &gt;&gt;&gt;that will erase your 
&gt;hard drive.  Be sure to share this with others.  It 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;may help them a lot.
&gt;
&gt;This may be old news or totally worthless, but I 
&gt;thought I would forward it. Let the buyer beware.

Funny thing just happened.  The other list server to which I 
subscribe, Scuba-UK, had a similar warning.  Now, can those of 
you who profess to work with 'computers' :P tell me if it is 
possible for a virus to be downloaded on an ASCII line?  

I was going to ask this on the other list but I don't post 
there very much.  However, you lot *know* how weird I get!

*** Ennis, Ireland.  A weird place to live.
*** Viva the Bushrats!    ***   Go Dale, #3!
*** Leave Intel alone Thom.
*** They've suffered enough.    ;)
