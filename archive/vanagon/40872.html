Subject: Brazilian clutch parts
Date: Tue, 30 Apr 1996 10:40:43 -0500 (CDT)

I am about to order a clutch cover and a clutch disc for my '71 bus.  
I can get both pieces Brazilian for $40 or both in German for $71.  I 
believe that in some cases the Brazilian version is the same as the 
German one.  Is this the case here?  Thanks, Jim
