&gt; 
&gt; You may want to try some of the larger auction houses. It seems that the 93
&gt; EVs that were part of VWs lease program are starting to come &quot;off lease&quot;. I
&gt; was at the local VW dealer talking to the sales manager (trying to find a
&gt; hard date the Concept 1 was comming in....no I'm not trading the EV for 1)..
&gt; 
&gt; On his desk was a list of VW lease cars going up for auction at the Mannheim
&gt; Auction down in Pennsylvania. There were VWs and Audis of all types,
&gt; including EV CLs, GLs, MVs and Weekenders. Unfortunately there was no info
&gt; as to price, however when I pressed the issue, it seems that auction, EVs
&gt; are going for $11k and up.

Ric is correct, the Manheim auction is the place to go if you are looking 
for a VW.....it is located in Lancaster County.... in the Amish Country
