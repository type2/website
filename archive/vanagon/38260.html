&gt;Well, after many cold nights I finally completed my brake rebuild.  All new
&gt;wheel cylinders, shoes, and lines.  Repacked the bearings up front and am
&gt;preparing to drain/refill aforementioned transmission and reduction gears.
&gt;My question is: what size is that damn drain/fill bolt?  Is it 17mm?  That
&gt;number seems to stick out in my mind for some reason.  Where am I gonna find
&gt;that sucker?

Yup, 17mm Allen wrench.  I got mine at a large local hardware store, and
I've seen them at Sears.  As mentioned before on this list, a good
procedure to
follow is to make sure you can get the fill plug out before you go
and take out the drain plug :-)
