I'm told they do around 14 -16 mpg.  Cruise real nice at 70 mph.  I just 
obtained a 27' Tioga Arrow with the Ford 460, 4:10 rear and overdrive trans.  
It is getting 10 mpg.  Somewhat big and awkward to drive but it does have an 
awful lot of room and toys.  That price of $49k for the used one is 
ridiculous.  The local RV dealer by me quoted $46k for brand new 97, fully 
loaded including generator and roof air.  Even the TV and VCP was in there.

Do they become real gas hogs like the usual rv van conversions?  I got a
price of 49000 for a used '96 in Maine but wondered if I could keep it in gas!
