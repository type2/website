Me personally? I'd fly to California, spend a week in the SF area, buy a
GOOD/EXCELLENT late model air-cooled Westy  -80-83-  (as Joel says they have
some genuine advantages over the previous models) and pocket the 20 thousand
you have left over. And oh yeah buy a gas heater for it....
If I HAD to spend the 30 thousand then it would be on a 89-90
synchro...but who has 30 thou? DC
