Subject: Pillow Drop

To the 20 or so people who wanted to know the best solutions to the falling
pillow problem (from top bunk of Westy) here is the definitive list of
ideas/suggections.  No priority order.

1.  Sleep with head to low end of roof - uncomfortable.
2.  Velcro on corners of pillow attached to velcro on fitted sheet -
prevents snuggling and bunching of the pillow.
3.  Turning the fitted sheet head end upwards to wrap around the pillow -
makes the top bunk a little too short.
4.  Creating a net attached along the bunk head and about 300mm high held
verticle by two strings running up to the roof support frame - hard to
climb up and down over the net.
5.  Sleep on the lower bunk where you can reach over and pick up the pillow
- miss out on the sounds of nature!
6.  Make a long pillow the same width as the bunk and rely on my wife to be
the anchor - works fine most times but when it does fall the result is two
people awake!
7.  Steal partners pillow - many fights follow and at some stage someone
has to go down to retreive the dropped one.
8.  Always keep pillow away from edge - causes disrupted and stressful sleep.
9.  Use double sided velcro on head - must remember to remove pillow from
head before taking shower.
10.  Use extended sheet that wraps over pillow and returns down bed to be
under the sleeper - can easily get tangled up and strangled.
11.  Use a pillow slip sewn onto the fitted sheet cover - my pick for best
idea.
12.  Don't use pillow - and be prepared to drive with a crooked neck.
13.  Fill in the hole at the top of the bed with a removable panel - could
be great for a radio too but could be a hassle getting down during the
night, OK for you young folks.

Thanks for the input!  Great list of ideas.
