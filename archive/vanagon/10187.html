Subject: Re: Westy manuals

I'll be happy provide a copy of the parts catalog to anyone.  I will
demand something in return &gt;;^} My own bus prefs lie south of 1972, so I
wouldn't be interested in any lit later than '71.  No offense.... 

I hereby promise to go make copies this weekend (hey, I have no time -- 
can't read mail and news at work like you guys :-).

Looks like no more than 10 are needed...

...that's about 150 pages each, black print and line drawings on slightly 
yellowed (and real cool smelling) paper.  I don't even remember the going 
rate for copies, but this is a college town.  _We_ have 24-hour-a-day 
copy centers.

Note: the paper size is a little odd (like 10x12 or something), so what 
you get will be mildly reduced to fit 8.5x11 paper.
