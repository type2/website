I don't believe that any went into regular production.

&gt;There were rumors  that the first syncros were breadloafs, and I once 
&gt;glimpsed a picture or two. Finally, I have the evidence, a photo of a

&gt;4x4 breadloaf crawling up a snowbank. Several prototypes were built,
&gt;including
&gt;two Westies.
