Subject: Re: Bentley Manual 91 Vanagon

Maybe I'm lucky or something,  but when I purchased my '87 Syncro from the
VW-Volvo Dealer in Corvallis, Oregon last July, I just asked for the &quot;Shop
Maual&quot; which cost about $80.  I never knew who wrote it till I kept seeing
the subject pop up here on the list.

Yes, It was written by Bentley......   If worse comes to worse,  Call
information for Jack Scoville LTD. in Corvallis, Oregon and see where they
get it.  But first, check your local dealer.
