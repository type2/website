Hey:

My '90 synchro Westie came to me used....from Alaska, no less.  By amd large 
it is in good shape, leading me to beleive that all the wear the previous 
owner inflicted on the vehicle was accumulated in the front table (the one 
that plugs in behind the drivers seat).  So much wear, in fact, was 
acculumated in the table that the table finally wore out.  musta just sorta 
evaporated one day, right before she sold it.....8-|.....leaving the rest of 
the van virtually wear-free.

What I'm trying to say, is I need a front table for my vanagon.  Dealer 
wants my next 3 paychecks for the parts alone.....Have thought about 
fabricating what I can and buying what I have to (the nifty swivel joit at 
the top)  but the list opens up new possibilities.....anyone got an 
extra/spare/whatever, or know where I can find one?

My thanks to all in advance....
