Subject: Re: idle compensator circuit for A/C equiped Digijet

Hey,

Well, I solved the problem of my '87 Vanagon with the 1.9 Digijet stalling
whenever I turn on the A/C at idle.

I went to the junkyard and found a A/C equipped Digijet Vanagon and pulled
one of the little white box like things on the forward right hand side of the
engine compartment (has 2 vacuum hoses and 2 wires into 1 plug going into
it).  It's called the IDLE SPEED BOOST VALVE (your local VW parts guy will
NOT find it in the Vanagon fiche but he/she will find it in the '84 Golf and
Jetta fiche (they come in a pair mounted on a bracket - 1 for the A/C and 1
for the power steering) and they are expensive so I recommend the junkyard
for those so needing)

I hooked it up like the BENTLEY manual says (+ to the A/C compressor clutch
wire on the compressor, - I grounded to the firewall; and the 2 vacuum lines
I teed to either side of the AUXILIARY AIR REGULATOR (HAYNES MANUAL pg. #
24.24b).  Well it worked for me.

I got some e-mail question from someone when I started researching this a
week or so ago but NETCOM screwed up my acct. so I cannot retrieve their
address.  So if you're still out there I hope this helps.

See ya,

Perry
