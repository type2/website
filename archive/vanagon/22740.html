Subject:       aerodynamic headlight repair

Well, this is really just an excuse for an air compressor.

I just repaired a 'bullet' hole in the aerodynamic headlight of my 
Toyota (251,000 miles!) that had subsequently filled with water 
'cause i didn't get to it right away.  Here's how:

1.  If you see any moisture condensing on the lens there is ALOT more 
in there resting on the bottom of the headlight.  it must be removed 
to prevent halogen bulb shattering and fogging.  Remove the headlight 
and stick of piece of rubber tubing on the end of your air nozzle.  
Lock the lever down and set the air pressure to about 3 or 5 psi, 
just a nice, gentle air flow.  put the hose in the lens assembly 
where you took the bulb out.

2.  set a heat lamp up to shine into the front of the lens.  let the 
air flow and heat dry out the interior over-night.  i removed about 
1/2 cup of water this way.

3.  when the lens is dry seal the hole or crack with, ready-- Shoe 
Goo!!  it's clear, resilient, tenacious adhesion,  available, and 
cheap.  i equate this to the 'perfect' shim material as discussed in 
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance... anyone know what that 
material was?
