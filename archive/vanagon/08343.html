Subject: Was it mice?  

Remember our heater fun last weekend?  120 miles across
frozen prairie at subzero (F) temps?  It was the damned
mice again.  Thanks to you fine folks, I got it fixed, too.

Someone else on the list was having trouble with their heater &amp; described
our symptoms to a T.  Their fan was jammed, which blew the fuse.
So, I looked at the Bus.  Fuse blown.  &quot;Aha!&quot; says I.  So off
comes the shield, etc. &amp; lo!  The heater fan/impeller was barely
able to turn.  A little cleaning &amp; grease, (and a new fuse), 
and now it's fine.  Now there's a screen over the gas heater's 
exhaust, to keep the mice-bastards from hopping in at will.  Are
all these heater problems caused by mice?  Maybe, maybe not.
But it *is* really nice to make them the scapegoat.  And I can't
help but think all the crap they kept dragging in didn't have
something to do with this...
