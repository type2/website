Subject: Radiator Bleeding

Hello Listers-

I'm still going through my '88 westy I got this week, and have determined that 
there must be some of the &quot;bad&quot; antifreeze (w/ phosphate) in it.  I conclude 
this because it is green, and from going through receipts from PO where 
antifreeze was added at $13/gal (too cheap).  As I am planning a 500 mile trip 
leaving tomorrow, I have a few questions...

1.  Is this a critical thing, or should I just go on the trip and change the 
coolant after?

2.  If I need to change it before (ie tonight), could someone post how one 
refills/bleeds the system.  I've gone throught the archives which has lots of 
info on flushing and draining, but articles all end with  &quot;refill and bleed 
per Bentley&quot;.  I've ordered my Bentley, but don't have it yet.

Thanks for bandwidth...

david
