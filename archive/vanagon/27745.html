I know of two outfits in the Victoria area...

	Malahat Auto Parts - 478-4751
	
	I've only seen CIS engines used in their transplants. 


	Autospiel - 360-0173

	CIS and Digifant. 

I have no affliation with the former, but the latter is a friend and did 
my transplant. He also rebuilds syncro transmissions.
