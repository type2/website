Subject: Syncro-Tech. front axle Question


     I am putting together the front end to my Syncro and late
     Sat. night I looked at the Bentley manual,.. I'm not sure
     why at this point .... but found it to state somthing I didn't expect.

     When installing the outer front CV joint into the wheel
     hub Bentley wants the splines to be lock compounded to the 
     hub! Bentley manual state &quot;apply locking compound D6 around
     splines of outer CV joint in a bead approx. 6 mm (1/4 in) 
     wide&quot;.  My hubs had not been lock compounded in, the last time
     it was removed. I am wandering if this is nessasary? I plain
     more work in a year or so. This would make removal, real work.
     My Manual is a 1987 edition. Maybe this was removed from newer
     versions?   Anyone have throughts on this?
