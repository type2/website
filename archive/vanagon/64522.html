While on this topic I might as well ask if anyone has any advice on how to
fix the the inside lock.  The piece that you push up to unlock the door won't
stay in the up position, making it impossible to leave the door unlocked.
Granted this isn't a big deal. The PO stuck a wire nut in the hole when he
wanted to keep it unlocked, however, it would be nice to have it work the way
it is supposed to.  Oh yeh, I don't think that it makes any difference, but
just in case.  It's an 81 Westy.  Thanks in advance.
