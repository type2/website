I was trying to install the &quot;Poor Man's Air Conditioner&quot; fan in my '76 
Campmobile today, kept busy with that, didn't get it connected but it kept
my mind off Jerry's death. I'm lucky I haven't been bitten by a
crocodile, cause I've been in de Nile all day. But what you wrote is so 
on target (I mean, a '76 Camper? How can this person not be speaking 
directly to me?) that I've gotta face how sad I feel. Thank you.

&gt; My  heart is so heavy tonight.
&gt; If it were not for the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia I would not have:
&gt; -the intrest I have in VWs and my '76 Camper
&gt; -my girlfriend
&gt; -my BEST friends 
&gt; -lots of friends I have not met yet who wave or would stop if I was on 
&gt; the side of the road because they saw a Dead sticker
&gt; -the intrest in the varied styles of music that I do
&gt; -and lots more
&gt; 
&gt; Right after work today I went to he drug store and bought shoe polish. On 
&gt; the back window of my van it now says &quot;Jerry Garcia RIP 8/1/42 - 8/9/95&quot; 
&gt; and on a side window &quot;He was a friend of mine&quot;.
&gt; Please don't make fun, there are so many out there hurting right now.
