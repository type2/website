This problem sounds remarkably similar to one I had.  Basically, same 
symptoms and intervals and happened in Winter and Summer.

I discovered that by resecuring the plug harness to the coolant temp 
sensor on the water pump, the problem would go away.  I have a 
slightly hammered plug that I've never got around to replacing so I 
used a little locktite inside the socket and it has worked fine for 2 
years.

Perhaps your plug is making intermittant connections.  Also, there is 
a ground wire and terminal next to the coolant temp sensor plug and 
I've always wondered if that might be a culprit too.
