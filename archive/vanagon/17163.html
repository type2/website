Might I suggest that your fan may have been old ,faulty or misplaced .....

The one I had installed in my '71 bus made the difference between sitting
in a lil' blue oven (when stuck in traffic) and getting a nice breeze as
the fan oscillated by...     I was thrilled to have had it in there!

Of course, mine was mounted just behind me and over my head so I got
maximum effect from it....
