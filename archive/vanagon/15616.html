..Um... Lots.  For me at least.  Read about it in the forthcoming Big 
Tour Trip Report.  Suffice to say, on the dirt (roads?) of Mexico I was 
frequently glad that I had riveted my license plate to the front bumper, 
learned that the metal used for the pan under the pedals could be pounded 
back into shape, and was rather amazed to use the front bumper like a 
bulldozer blade crossing the more serious arroyos. Ground clearance?  I 
want lots of it!  Hell, I'd like to RAISE my next bus an inch or two to 
help me get where I wanna go.  
The sole undercarriage casualty of all this idiocy?  One split outer CV 
joint boot.  Oh, poo. :)


&gt; ... 4 million people can't be wrong.
No?
