Earlier I wrote:

1. People have been talking about converting buses to campers.  How/where
do I get started??

I must add that I do already have a gypsy tent that goes on the sliding
door.  I am most interested in the interior, although wolove to 
add a pop top if someone can give an easy way to do it. 
 
&gt; Did a '78 over, but I cheated and used real VW Westy guts from a junkyard. 

Great idea!!!!  I didn't even think of that!!!!  Now to find one in good
shape!!!

&gt;From the following, it seems as thougit might be quite difficult to 
add the pop top :

&gt; The real Westys used to have a double skin roof to beef up the ceiling 
&gt; cutout, busses don't, so fixing up beds etc. into the pop-top is a bit hard. 
&gt; The newer double bed models have a huge cutout, but I don't know about roof 
&gt; structure of them, anyone else help here?. It's dead easy to get the 
&gt; interior done over, in a weekend or two including the woodpanelling if you 
&gt; salvaged it. The roof is a different matter, woodpanelling requires the 
&gt; galvanized steel support channels be also salvaged from the junker. Any more 
&gt; roof work is scary, you'll at least have to cut a huge hole, bend some edges 
&gt; up, and mount the pop-top, (more drilling/screws).  or....

Anybody else have an easier way or am I stuck??

&gt;  Get a sunroof bus, buy two BIG luggage racks for front and rear, some 
&gt; plywood, and find a tent to cover the entire lot, attached to the rain gutters?
Maybe an air supported dome (Astrodome?!?!?).  :)  Maybe Ringling Bros.  
has some extras!!!!!    

Thanks for your help Tim!!!o

Ken

P.S. - I think thaa small carvan of bricks on the road wouldrow

the hell is going on!!!!y
