Subject:      Intermittant loss of power

I have a 90 westfalia that about once a month or so loses power after
running about 2 miles. It will slow right down and stall. i can always start
it right up again and it will run oK at an idle but backfire and stall if
given any gas. It will do this for maybe about 2 minutes then as it gets a
bit warmer it runs fine again an the problem may not happen again for weeks.
I have checked for bad grounds but all looks fine . I would be grateful for
any suggestions. thanks in advance.
