 I need some tire advice.  I have a 1980 Vanagon Camper, and I need to buy 
 two new back tires.
 On the front I have Michelin xch4's.
 I can get the Yokohama Y370's for $69.95 each from a local tire place.
 Also, he mentioned a Michelin XZ4 for $85.95 each.
  &gt;&gt;

I vote for the Y370's.  I'm still happy with mine since November
