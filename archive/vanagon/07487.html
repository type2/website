Subject: Syncro experiences?

     My family has outgrown our trusty 4WD Civic wagon, and as a fond
     former owner of an early Type II, I'm thinking about starting a search
     for a Syncro camper. I'm looking for general advice, such as

     1) Effectiveness of Syncro vice 2WD? We use the Honda extensively
     in snow, and for reaching remote trailheads for backpacking... not
     hardcore offroad, but some very marginal roads/tracks.
     2) Technical problems with Syncro vehicles? Anything special for
     a prepurchase inspection?
     3) any other things I should consider
     4) any such vehicles which might be for sale.

     Thanks
