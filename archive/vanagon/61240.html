Subject: Rear name badge and a euro-light question

     Hmmm-
     
     Seems that on one of my trips to Germany in the late eighties, I 
     picked up a rear badge for the Westfalia that said &quot;Camping&quot;.  If I 
     find it, I might have a &quot;Vanagon&quot; badge to part with.
     
     Do European-market Vanagons have any type of side blinker light just 
     aft of the front doors?
