Subject: '83 Westy w/o engine

Hello,

I have the opportunity to purchase a very clean, nearly unused '83
Westy,whose engine has been stolen, for a mere $400.   Is it possible to
convert this to a different engine than a watercooled vw?  Would it be
legal in California?  Any advice is welcome.  TIA.

Mark
