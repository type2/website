&gt; What an incredible coincedence, I drove this stretch of land this week-end
&gt; on the way home from Moncton, NB and there was very high wind indeed.
&gt; Coming over a strech called Folly Mtn, The wind popped my camper top with a
&gt; huge noise and wrenching sideways feeling. Not good, thought I.
&gt; The rubber Holders that fasten the top down had failed. They were 25 years old. 
&gt; Now the question is with what do I replace them? I used a hose clamp
&gt; sideways to hold it down and get it home.
&gt; Everyone should carry hose clamps.
&gt; I also noticed that the sliding bracket on the front drivers side had sheered.

Believe me, as one who's had first hand experience with wind and a fiberglas
pop-top, I am definately going to look into a more secure method of securing
that top other than the rubber holders.  If wind finds a way (wind and
water ALWAYS find a way) under that top, the rubber holders are just no good.
Anybody got alternate methods?
