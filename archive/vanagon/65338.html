I can probably host the page from a server I use hear at work. You may want
to check with the vanagon_dot_com webmaster. Maybe it can be hosted there. What
kind of computer are you on? PC or Mac?

&gt;I'm really smart about a lot of things. Cooking. Bosch engine management.
&gt;Corporate Communications Strategies for Fortune 500 companies.
&gt;
&gt;I am a complete dolt about the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;Now a lot of folks have been asking for the BIG posting I promised about
&gt;soundproofing/insulation/rustproofing VW's and I am working diligently on it.
&gt;It is now 5 pages in Word, and will probably come to an even dozen.
&gt;
&gt;I know there's got to be a better way to stick this fascinating tome out
&gt;there than e-mailing 12 pages of text to everyone on the list. Can some
&gt;kindhearted listee write or call and hold my hand through whatever I need to
&gt;do? (I washed this morning, I swear).
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, as always,
&gt;
&gt;gmbulley
&gt;fairfax, va
