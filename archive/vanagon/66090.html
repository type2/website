Subject:      Re: Rear Heater core leaking (help)!

IF it is the core, yeah, it'll have to be replaced to stop the leak ...
unless you do like i do and just don't use the rear heater. ;)

but for bleeding, there is a little screw-thingie on top of the heater
valve (core?) that is a bleed screw. this is what usually starts leaking
... the original ones were plastic. vw dealers are supposed to be able
to get a new bleed screw as a replacement part.

here's some tech info ...

from Service Bulletins, Model Year 1987
........................................................................
VW Technical Information
Group 80, Number 87-01
Date: July 31, 1987
Model(s): Water-cooled Vanagons, 1983-1985
Subject: Carpet wet by rear seat - heat exchanger bleeder screw broken

The plastic bleeder screw for the rear heat exchanger may be broken due
to seal swelling.
* Replace with an improved metal bleeder screw, Part number N 902 061 01.
  and new gasket, Part number 861 819 037.

Production Change:
Metal bleeder screw installed as of:
December 1984, VIN: 25 FM 050 887

as of 1995.04.04, this part number N 902 061 01 was invalid. the newer
part number for the Bleeder Screw, as seen on the 1993 Microfiche for
Vanagons 1983-1985 and Vanagons 1986-1991 is  861-819-039. the gasket
number is still the same. BUT the new Bleeder Screw seems to be plastic
again, not metal.
in fact, two reliable parts people have said that there were never any
&quot;metal&quot; bleeder screws ... only plastic. so apparently this tech info
is wrong. but a new bleeder screw might solve the leaking.
