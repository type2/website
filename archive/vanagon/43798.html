&gt;And it works fine. Have you tried leaving the stabilizer unbolted, and
&gt;just supported by its leads? Works for me...

Hello everyone,
     Supporting a electronic component by its leads is not a good idea.  It
does'nt take alot of vibration to break the internal connections.  An
insulating layer of plastic is normaly packaged with each TO036 type
component.  The center leg of the device is common to the tab.  In some
applications it needs to be isolated.  Also it is used as a heat sink,
Silicone grease or silicone heat sink compound is used under the tab.  The
tab takes the stress of  the device off of the terminal legs.
