&gt;I had a friend who went to Midas to get his GTI done...it was all crap! The 
&gt;mufflers were slightly different (for example the rear muffler has a &quot;dent&quot; 
&gt;in it to clear the shock absorber...the midas one didnt)..the system was put 
&gt;together using those cheap exhaust hangers you can get at any parts places - 
&gt;the ones with the long strip of perforated stees...a piece of cut up tire 
&gt;and then a u-bolt clamp...it vibrated, it sounded crappy...and probably 
&gt;because of the difference in backpressure, the GTI ran like crap.
&gt;

Been there/done that !!!.  Not only are they pure cr*p, but when you try to
get them (Midas, in my case) to honor their warranty you'll find out that
only the muffler is covered - not the lousy hangars ($10/ea) or the junk
tubing used (burns out in no time at all) - you can actually spend more on
the warranty than you did for the original installation !!!  (fortunately it
was on a '77 Rabbit, not on my beloved '87 VanGone).
