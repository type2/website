Sarah:
If I recall the details of your posting, you said that you had broken a 
piece out of the side of your crank pulley. A word of warning. If the piece 
you chipped out of you pulley includes surface area that is swept by the 
belt, it may lead to premature belt failure. I suggest that if you still 
have the piece, examine its inside surface to see if it is shinny.  If you 
don't have the piece,  you should remove the belt and examine the inside 
surface of the pulley to see if the shinny surface area extends into the 
boundary of the chip. If so, the side and perhaps edge of the belt is 
sweeping across the broken edge on each revolution of the crank. If it looks 
bad enough you might care to replace the pulley. If not, I suggest you file 
the broken edge smooth, and carry a spare belt and tools to change it.
Also, a much better tool to refurb the surface of points is a small flat 
file, or point file. Emery paper tends to make the surfaces convex  when 
they should be straight and parallel, and, worse yet, it sheds debris into 
the distributor.
Hope this helps. Good luck!
John S.
