Subject: 	Van at Viper Militia Place

How about that!!??

There was also a VW van sitting alongside the Branch Davidian farmhouse in
Waco before the place was torched by the ATF.  (you can see it in some of
the videotape taken before the fire)

Is this a trend?  

Or does VW ownership assure you of being considered a whacko in general?
