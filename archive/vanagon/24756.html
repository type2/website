    sorry, i don't see how this could be funny. i don't think its fair to
judge a group of people as a whole based on a single experience. that's
simply a prejudice. i firmly believe good and bad people occur fairly well
mixed on this planet and the idiots are not clustered in oregon. i'm really
disappointed nobody else has anything to say about this, REALLY LAME...
