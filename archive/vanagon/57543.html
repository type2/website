Subject: Re: Stock Alloy wheels ????


&gt;&gt;  What year or model Vanagon came with the 15&quot; alloy wheels????

&gt;An easy one!  NONE.

Oh boy, The Vanagon comes with 15&quot; alloys !after! '91. This was
because of larger disk brakes in the front. And the larger
disks (they are air ventilated) are need for the 100 kW engine.
Never heard of? Look at the South African VW factory.
