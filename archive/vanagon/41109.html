Subject: Automatic Phobia (Vanagon)

Hi all,

I recently acquired an 84 Vanagon that runs great, but does not move!  It 
has an automatic tranny that was run out of fluid due to a leaky 
gasket/seal and ceased to function.

I spoke to a local Vanagon addict and he told me to get it fixed as they 
are *great* trannies and even used in commerical vehicles in Germany.  I 
have always avoided automatics as I prefer selecting my gears manually, 
but I may may draw an exception in this case.  I originally bought the Van 
to strip out, but may wife likes it (a rarity) and I am thinking of 
rebuilding the tranny myself as I am a hobbist mechanic of sorts.  8-)

Any advice on rebuilding/replacing Vanagon automatics?  There may be a 
few in the local boneyards if mine is beyond repair.  What kind of costs 
can I expect??  Any input welcome.  Thanks.
