Subject:      Lack of BBTA Info/HELP WANTED

I feel pretty guilty over the confusion over BBTA facts; it's my job to
keep up the Transporter Trips &amp; Tours page and I haven't updated the thing
for months. It isn't even linked right now because there's nothing worth
looking at in it, really.

I just don't have time. So:

HELP WANTED -- Events Czar. The successful candidate will have a basic
knowledge of HTML (images and anchors, we'll supply you a template).
Involves scouring the net, magazines, flyers and rumor mill for Bus events
and posting relevant details to the type2_dot_com web page. Scanner helpful but
not required. Text processor that can save to an FTP server is a real help.

An couple hours a week should do it. The successful candidate is not going
to expect to get paid, either. ;)

I have a few more &quot;positions&quot; in mind, too, I have a plate that is too big
and stuff is not being done well because of my neglect.

Pmail. Thanks,
