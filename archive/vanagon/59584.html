It seems unlikely that 500 people will subscribe for $3.00 each.  When you
find out how many are willing, I will pony up my share, up to $50 US.  That
would be maybe 10% of what this list has saved me already, with more to
come as I get around to trying to put the engine back in my '81.  Came out
real easy, but getting it in is always harder...

&gt;I just want to mention that I'm willing to run the list, but I'd need to
&gt;purchase a machine and software (LISTSERV) to host the list, which would
&gt;cost approximately $1500.00.  Bandwidth is not a problem... my site has a T1.
&gt;
&gt;If folks on the list are willing to pony up an average of $3 apiece for a
&gt;host machine and the LISTSERV software license, I'll run the list.
