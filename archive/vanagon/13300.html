Subject: Re: King Of The Van Heap

&gt;The problem with this question is that it could cause some people to
&gt;proclaim that their year/model of van is King Of The Van Heap, thereby
&gt;introducing a no-win situation into the Vanagon list.

I really didn't want this to happen.  As I said in my original post, I love
the older vans, but I'm afraid that they would be too much maintenance.  At
least one response has said &quot;It ain't so!&quot;

I'm just wondering aloud... what should I do?

Getting a Vanagon Westfalia Syncro GL sounds great, though I doubt I could
find one.  Do the Syncros get lousy mileage?
