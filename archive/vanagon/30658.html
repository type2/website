&gt; &gt;The stock  gas heater is mounted in the left side of the engine compartment

&gt; I was at the local FLAPS reading the Haynes shop manual for
&gt; '68-'79 Transporters.  In the middle of the book is a cutaway
&gt; view showing the drivetrain and location of an auxilary gas
&gt; heater.
&gt; 
&gt; It's underneath, mounted just forward of the transmission, 
&gt; in-line on the ducting that runs from the heater boxes to the 
&gt; steel duct pipe under the cockpit floor.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember this is from a Haynes manual for bay window busses.
&gt; I've never actually seen a gas heater in a bus, so I'm a little 
&gt; curious.  

well i am more familiar with splits rather than bay windows (although i have had both), but thomas 
johnson described very clearly how the gas heater is installed. i have never seen a factory  gas heater 
installed

&quot;underneath, mounted just forward of the transmission&quot;
