Subject: Fantasy new discount parts source

&gt;but if list members were to accumulate enough orders 
&gt;to make this company's minimum order requirement (apparantly $1000, 
&gt;at least initially),

Jeez... I bet anyone who owns a water cooled VW van could *easily* qualify for
that $1000 minimum on the first order all by themselves.....
