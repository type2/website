To All:

A loose front tranny mount is also the cause of a host of 'mysterious'
electrical problems such as hard starting or an intermittant miss due to a
loose ground strap (which fastens to the tranny mount).  Because of the
geometry of the mount you often can't tell if the nuts are tight just by
looking.  Try them with a wrench.
