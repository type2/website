My opinions only of course...

&gt; We had just about resolved to keep fixing the 1988.
&gt; Having examined the Eurovan camper and been severely

&gt; Unfortunately, we reviewed the VW Web Site the other

&gt; modified long-wheelbase camper.
&gt; So, before I pony up Cdn $45,000 (which I don't have),
&gt; can V_at_L members advise me? 

Is this the Rialta with the 'big box' or the lengthened normal box?  I 
can't quite decide from your information.  At that price I'm guessing 
Rialta but I'm not up on the current exchange rate from our Yankee money.

&gt; Is the 5-cylinder reliable?

Other than the piston slap it sure seems to be.  Ours is still young though.

&gt; Is the front-engine design sorted out yet?  

Been doing front wheel drive since 1975 I believe and the T4 since 1991 
or 1992 I believe.

&gt; Is the 4-speed automatic any good?

I'm not overwhelmed by it.  It certainly works but I would have preferred 
to have the manual transmission.

&gt; Is the paint better?

Better than what?

&gt; Should I see my bank manager?

Can't really answer that for you.  We're thinking about getting a Rialta 
but had expected to wait for the VR6 in a year or so.  TO add to not 
replace our VW stable.
