     Apparently so, bizarre as it sounds. One of the things
     I like best about the Campmobile is that I CAN'T drive
     at breakneck speeds, and I find the I luxuriate in 
     traveling at more human (and SAFER) speeds. People 
     driving like they were the protagonist in a Hollywood
     chase movie boggle the mind... maybe a bumper sticker
     that read

     &quot;you could drive safely if it mattered... right?&quot;
 
     ?
