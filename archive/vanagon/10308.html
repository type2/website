So Al Knoll says:
&gt; For us normally proportioned gnomes (66&quot;) I find that there is no way to adjust
&gt; the hanging rearview mirror to give a view of the road contents farther back
&gt; than say 50 feet.  If I tip it up I get a fine view of the AC housing bits.
&gt; 
&gt; So for us normal folk, anyone over five-six is a mutant BTW, how did your solve
&gt; the lookysee through the back window problem?        
&gt; 
&gt; For us short folks the snow is always just a little deeper.
&gt; 

A few years back before I had the '91 Camper or even the '74, I was scoping
out an acquaintances '86?? or so Camper.  He had the same problem, so he
mounted one of those do-it-yourself stick on mirrors down low on the 
windshield and said he could see alot better.  For me, that leans toward
the tacky side, so I haven't done it.  I can live without it.
