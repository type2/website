Subject: 80 vanagon in junkyard, engine, trans, heaters etc.

Hey all, 
So I went back to the heroin junkyard today to check on the vanagon
engine for 100 bucks.  The rear wheels have been removed so I asked
the guy if there was any way to jack the rear of the vanagon up so I
could look under neath.  He said sure and proceeded to jump in his fork
lift and drive right smack into the back of an older westie sitting next to
the vanagon.  (I had just been thinking to myself that this old VW westie
had some pretty straight body pieces and some on the type 2 list could
probably use the rear door)  So he slammed into the old westie and just
kept driving to push it out of the way.  (TOTAL LACK OF RESPECT FOR
OLDER VWs)

So that is now junk too.  The rear door could be OK, the large pop top
fiber shell was rough but was there, the luggag erack gone.  It popped
open to the rear of the vehicle.    So then I inquire what he would want
for the gas tank. He said 20 bucks.  He then proceeds to drive the forks
under the van and destroys the gas tank. 

After lifting tyhe vanagon,  I look under the vanagon and see no oil
plug.  Explains why there was no oil.  I was able to turn the engine over 
by hand at the alternator.  Could feel compression and felt no grinding
resistance..  That is somewhat of a good sign. 

Also under the vanagon the exhaust system looks different from my 82. 
Should they be similar?  Main difference I could see was the catalytic 
converter was to the side of the engine and the muffler extended all the
way across the back.  Most tin waws present.  I asked him what all I
could get with the engine.  He said trans for 75.  Anyone out there need
this piece?  I did get in the vehicle and pushed the clutch in and shifted
into all positions.  (NOT SURE IF THAT MEANS MUCH)  He said I should
come out and strip off whatever extra engine stuff I want and it will be
thrown in and then they would pull the engine.  I want to try and get as
much of everything connected to the engine.  Anyone else have any
thing to say about that (other pieces to grab).  I plan to go out there
tomorrow and strip all the extras.  I imagine this place will cut the bus in
pieces to get the engine out if it is anything like what I have seen already.
 Probably will come with half a tranny still connected.  

So that is the progress for the spare engine and stuff.  Any one want
anything else looked at.  The vehicle has 115k miles.   It did have a BA6
heater still in.  They probbably would sell that for 20 - 50 bucks.  

All for now, more progress reports later. Ken  82 westie
