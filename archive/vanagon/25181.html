Subject: Re: VW Bus Reviews???

&gt;Today we have numerious magazines giving long write-ups on every new car
and
&gt;model available.  During the '70s was there such a magazine for original
&gt;model year reviews?  Something like &quot;Introducing the new 1978 VW Bus!&quot;  I'd

&gt;love to hear the explanations of the &quot;new&quot; features.  Any suggestions?

Road and Track published their VW reviews in a two volume set running from the
fifties to the eighties (maybe  there is a third volume by now) even includes a
comparison with a DKW van. I have copies of these volumes, and I can supply the
full refrences to these --- tomorrow (I didn;t bring them to work with me).
