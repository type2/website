Subject: Re: Craftsperson Tools

Thought I'd chime in on tools from my lurk here:

On the box wrenches the 17mm and 19mm come in handy also the big one to 
turn the crankshaft nut (21mm??) when adjusting points and timing and 
whatnot.

On the socket set I *highly* recommend splurging on a set of extensions 
of different lengths and a universal joint.  I agree with Joel that 
starting out with 3/8 is enuf to get started, but I remember buying a set 
where they throw in a 1/2&quot; rachet with a few sockets for not much extra and 
for the larger bolts you'll need the leverage.

I've also had good luck with Craftsman diagnotic tools: timing light, 
tach-dwell, compression gauge.  These are not, though, covered by their 
lifetime guarantee.

Cheers, Tim
