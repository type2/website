VW has made them and still continues with the Eurovan to this day.  A =
recent Hot VW's mag shows a 90 Synchro version.  Unfortunately they =
don't appear in the U.S. Dealerships.  Rumor has it that they are =
available in Canada.

On a trip to the U.K. Last year I saw a VW van slightly smaller than a =
Eurovan that had panel sides.
I don't know what it was called...
