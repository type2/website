So corbin blaine connell sez:
&gt;
&gt;I need to R&amp;R the wiper motor in my split window bus.
&gt;Could someone briefly describe this proceedure?
&gt;
&gt;It looks like its buried up against the front wall,  Must I remove the 
&gt;dash assembly or is there another way? (I suppose cutting a hole in the 
&gt;front exterior is another way :(    )

Ok,

	remove the screws/bolts for the dash tray - there will be some along the
top front of it and 2 17mm bots holding the dash tray to the steering
column support.

	Lower the tray slightly, be careful of the speedo cabel.m Remove the
speedo cable ifyou think it'll make it easier for ya - I never do though.

	Remove the wiper arms.A

	Remove the large nuts holding the wiper shafts to the body.  Save these
nuts!

	There is a 10mm bolt on the bottom of the wiper motot assembly that 
holds the whole shebang in _and_ is the ground pont for the motor.  Take it
off.  

	Pull the wiper assembly back towards you until the shafts clear the
holes, and then move the whole assembly left and right to clear the
dash supports.
	
	By this time you shoulf be able to get your hands on the wires.  Make
a drawing of how they went on, ande then remove them.

	Take the wiper assembly the rest of the way out.

	You can test the motor by hooking up a battery to it on the ground.

	New motors are available depending on the year and voltage.  '67
was a one year only, and the 12V 66's are also hard to find.

	Hope this helps...
