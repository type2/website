Subject: Gotta buy snow chains....

Hi folks,

Well, I guess I've waited as long as I can to go without 
show chains for the '91 Vanagon.  The tires are size is
205/70 R14 97R, RadialX Reinforced MXLs.  There, that's
a mouthful.  Anyway, can I just go to Pep Boys or somewhere
like that and purchase light truck tires or do I need to 
get some kind of special order?  Anything else I should be
aware of?

Thanks,
