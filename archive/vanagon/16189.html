Subject: Re: Saggy BUs + anti-sway

Sags in the front? My 71 Kombi sags a bunch in the back. It has anti-sways
front and rear, and though I don't believe they effect &quot;Le Sag&quot; I do call for
some supportive person to lay the foundation in me, a righteous act which
will supend my non-belief in anti-sway items. They are unmarked as far as I
know but were described by a pretty good mechanic as &quot;...big 'ol anti-sway
bars...&quot; Hmmm?
