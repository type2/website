Subject: Re: Advice needed: Accessory pricing questions? 

&gt;	Swivel Seat:  $420  (Is this worth it?  do y'all who have 
&gt;			it like it?  Or should I just blow it off?)
&gt;		Porta-Potty:  $125   (Is this necessary?  It seems like a 
&gt;					big space waster to me)
&gt;		Pop top:  $3250
&gt;		Sink/stove/fridge/cabinets:  $4750 (actually, this 	
&gt;			includes a lot more, so if the price looks high, 
&gt;			that's why--cutains, fire ext, carpeting, 	
&gt;			lights, water holder etc. etc.)
&gt;		Bra for front:	$125   (Do you like it?)
&gt;		Sun Roof:	$295
&gt;		Luggage Rack:	$125
&gt;		Awning:		$490	(Seems like nice to have)
&gt;		Tent for rear:	$325	(envelopes rear to extend 	
&gt;			back--also seems like a very nice thing to have)


With all that, you could have just saved yourself alot of money, and bought a
cheap mid-eighties westy, and thrown in the 2 person middle seat out of a 7
pass, and a bench front seat from a 9 pass, Then you would have a 7 or 8
passenger westy.....		

too late now, I guess....
