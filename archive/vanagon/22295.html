  OFFICE MEMO          Soggy seats and short trip report      Date:8/8/95

hi all
    My wife and three kids are on a 5 week-cut down-to-3-week (they're getting
tired) trip around the country in our '87 vanagon. She's been having a problem
that she can't figure out and asked me to ask you all for some input. the back
seat and floor are getting soaked most every day, also the cushion over the
engine compartment (it has the weekender bed). at first she thought it was
condensation coming from the ac, but it seems to be way to much liquid for
that. they got a lot of rain in kansas, but the van has never leaked, and the
problem was there before they met with any rain, although it seemed to
disappear for a while in arizona and new mexico. it can't be coolant, because
the van is not losing anywhere enough to account for it, and she's so
sentitive to odors she would know right away if that was it. she says this is
definitely water. it's not a camper- there should be no water anywhere in the
van.
    to be honest, i think i figured it out after getting off the phone with
her last night and laying in bed thinking about it. where can water be coming
from i say to myself? there is no water in the van. it has to coming from a
water source somewhere. doh! the icechest!! either they aren't closing the
drain or it's broken/cracked somewhere. but i promised her i'd ask, and in any
case it might be something else i haven't thought of and someone else has
experienced.
    she's got a lot of guts taking off for a few weeks alone with 3 kids (ages
3, 11, and 14) with tents for the older 2 and the weekender bed for her and
the little one. i'm also grateful for the vacation for me, coming home from
work every night to a quiet house. it's heaven, although i am missing them.
   BARSLEAK SUCCESS
    This van has 170k mile on it and had just started having the heads leak in
the last couple of months. it was losing quite a bit of coolant(400-500 ml a
week).i was more than a bit apprensive about sending them out with such a
potential problem, but i  bled the cooling system before they left and added
barsleak. amazing!! the leaks are almost completely dried up and they've only
lost a tiny bit of coolant driving from san francisco to la, through and
around arizona and new mexico(HOT!!), to texas, then north, and they're now at
mt. rushmore. yellowstone is next, then salt lake city, and then back home.
the van has given them absolutely no trouble except the soggy seat problem,
which probably is not the van's fault.
Thanks for any input and wave if you see them - gold '87 vanagon.
