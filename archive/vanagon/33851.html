Subject: Re: VW Questions

Fred,

In so far as I know, you may ask questions anywhere on the internet.  As to
getting answers, that's more of a problem :-)

The Vintage VW list pretends to cover all air-cooled Volkswagens.  The
membership tends to be younger than the Vanagon list.  The opinions expressed
on the Vintage list are also liable to be a bit more shrill, less polite and
wildly inaccurate, when compared to the cooler heads (and greater experience)
over on the other list.

With regard to your question about installing a '73 sedan engine into a '72,
there's really no problem unless you happen to be in California, where the
smog laws require the finished product of such a swap to reflect the later
model year's emission controls.

The alternator/generator thingee isn't a problem.  If you can tell me the
markings on the alternator I can tell you if you need an external regulator.
 If so, get it when you get the engine.  But if the alternator has an
internal regulator (all the later models do) the installation calls for
making up a couple of wires and splicing them into the existing system.  It's
an easy task, doesn't take a lot of tools and works beautifully.

The Vanagon list is located at lenti.med.umn_dot_edu  and uses ListServor for
distribution.  Address your subscription request to
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu if you wish to join the list, or direct your
questions to vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu.
