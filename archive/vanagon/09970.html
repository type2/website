Subject: 71 Westy- mostly apart

To all-
I've torn down the engine to the case.  Has a siezed #2 rod bearing.  
On the bummer list are:  Both heads have cracks in them, Pistons are junk.
2 push rods are bent, one so bad I wonder how the thing still survived.  

On the positive: Heater boxes are in good shape.

Thanks for the advice on where to shop.
I have one question:
on the case, under the oil cooler, there is stamped &quot;020&quot;.  I have a hunch 
that this means the case is line bored 20 thou. over.  Any one know if this 
is true, and does anyone have the stock dimension of the mains?  I could 
then measure and be sure.
thanks   
Chris Bridge
