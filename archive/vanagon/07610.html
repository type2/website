&gt; Dan Houg opens his heart....

&gt; Hello group-
&gt; I am soliciting advice.  All opinions welcome, from 'you're #$%&amp;ing 
&gt; crazy' to 'welcome brethren'     Here's my situation:
&gt; 
&gt; Currently I own an '85 Weekender.  Usual assortment of problems/joys. 
&gt;  I will be selling my 850 Norton Commando due to a longing to keep my 
&gt; skull intact for my family (2 young kids, fun wife etc.).  I am 
&gt; contemplating turning the money from the Norton over into an 
&gt; AIRCOOLED mid 70's camper while still retaining the '85 for day-today 
&gt; use.  The aircooled would be a long-term fixup project (something to 
&gt; tinker with).  
&gt; 
&gt; My question is this, and I know it's a very personal one but I'd like 
&gt; input... ** Am I getting into a continual nightmare of niggling repairs 
&gt; and nickel/diming me to death or are the joys of uniqueness, 
&gt; comaraderie (watercoolers don't wave to each other), worth the 
&gt; frustrations?**  I am mechanically able but with fairly significant 
&gt; time commitments.  Is it crazy to own one of each? Will you folks 
&gt; support me? Will you answer my newbie aircooled questions with the patience 
&gt; of an understanding parent?  Will Lassie ever come home?  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for listening.
&gt; Dan (am I crazy?) Houg       '85 Weekender and counting...
&gt; 
  
  You asked for it so here it is:

  First of all - Do not sell the Norton, you WILL regret it. Once you have
  motorcycles in your blood, they are there forever. I have 3 kids and just
  ride carefully - I'm a believer that excessive speed has a lot to do
  with the frequency of motorcycle accidents. Besides, having a parent who
  rides a motorcycle seems to attenuate interest in cycles by the kids. It's 
  them you don't want riding, right?

  Second: Everybody knows in their heart of hearts that all REAL VW buses are
  aircooled (that should get me in some trouble....). My experience, after 
  owning 3 campers: a '64, a '72 and a '74, is that the Type IV engine buses
  are mechanically very solid if every single piece of rubber in the engine
  compartment is changed once every five years. Almost all the problems I've 
  experienced have been due to a cracked rubber elbow, a leaking fuel line,
  etc. My '64 had an appetite for exhaust valves, usually breaking the number
  three, ingesting it into the cylinder, trashing all related parts and 
  immobilizing the vehicle. I have NEVER been stranded, knock on wood, by
  either of the other buses. 

  The wife and I have been living by an automotive philosophy which could be
  called the &quot;Multiple Heap Credo&quot;. The hypothesis is this: Several old cars
  will serve your transportation needs better than a smaller number of new 
  ones. Generally, one or more of them is running - When one won't start, you
  take another and deal with the first one when it is convenient for YOU.
  This automotive lifestyle allows you to have a variety of vehicles. The wife
  enjoys her '73 MGB most of the time. When she has to haul large quantities 
  of kids, there is a '77 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser Wagon. Said Custom Cruiser
  is also good for hauling plywood or trips to the dump. When we go out as
  a family, we take the '74 Westfalia - the hands down favorite travelling
  vehicle of everyone. We also have an '82 Nissan POS sedan for when the MG
  isn't running. I will also claim that all these vehicle save money. The only
  place you get nailed is insurance. We buy liability only at about $325 per
  car per year. Registration and tax cost is low because everything is old
  and most other costs like fuel, oil, tires etc. are usage based and the sum
  total of miles driven is similar to what would be accumulated on fewer cars.
  
  So, you ask whether an old bus would nickel and dime you? Yes it would, but
  the nickel and dime stuff are your ONLY expenses. There are no payments, no
  big registration bills, no big &quot;gotta keep it under warranty&quot; dealer service
  bills. You work on it when you have time and when you feel like it - not 
  because you need it to get to work.

  Go for it! And get the SO something she's always wanted. Then there will be
  plenty of cars around so when your kids need to use one, you won't be stuck
  at home.

  I realize that there is much more answer here than there was question. My
  apologies to anyone who has waded through it all. Sure beats working!
