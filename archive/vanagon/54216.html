Subject: no start, starter motor?, 91

Greetings all,
        It appears as though my problem runs deeper than I had previously
thought. Last week, I had posted that my Vanagon woould'nt start in extreme
cold temperatures, and I assumed it was simply a weak battery. My efforts to
get her started include: pulling battery and leaving in house overnight,
warming up motor with a 50,000 btu kerosene heater (outside temp never got
above 5F), and jumping battery with a running van.

After warming up engine (warm to the touch), I installed my house-warmed
battery, hooked up jumper cables to good battery, and attempted to start.
Result: cranked over v e r y  s l o w l y. All battery connections are clean
and tight, as is the ground between tranny and body. The tranny is automatic
so push starting is out of the question.

According to Bentley, these symptoms (slow cranking) suggest bad starter.
Can anyone confirm or deny this diagnosis? Does anyone have any tips
regarding replacement of starter? Bentley recommends removing axle, but says
its not necessary. Anyone have experience with this. Also, sources? NAPA
sells a rebuilt for $175! ouch.

Thanks for any info, Patrick
