Subject: Re: Bay Area drive-in night!

Well I'm too far away to come but maybe you guys should consider combining this outing
with the blow-up-fireworks-and-other-combustibles outing.  I remember some kids doing
this at a local drive-in when I was a kid.  We were laying on our blanket on the outer
edge behind a big pick-up when all of a sudden 3 sets of fireworks started going off.
They were the one that shot big balls up into the air and there were 3 sets going off
(one on each side of the lot and one at the back).  It was pretty cool.  As I recall
each one set off about 5-10 of these fireballs into the air above the drive-in.  In the
flashes of light we saw one of the employees heading our way so we high-tailed it out
of there and watched the remainder of the show from the cover of the trees along with
the guys who brought the light show.
