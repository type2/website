Subject: Re: Misfiring '80 fixed...I hope!!

&gt;Many thanks to all who responded to my plea for assistance.  On a
&gt;recheck of all the wiring while the van was running, I picked up the
&gt;cylindrical three-wire connector in the upper left corner of the
&gt;engine compartment, and ...you guessed it...a major hiccup.
&gt;
&gt;I noticed the connector had been taped with electrical tape by a
&gt;previous P.O. so I unwrapped it and the connections were very loose.
&gt;Closer inspection revealed the looseness was as a result of two
&gt;cracks in opposite sides of the female coupling, hence the tape!
&gt;


At least 80% of the time Maggie isn't running right either a hose or wire
(usually AFC related) has become loose or totally disconnected.  A thorough
check of the wires is the first step in any of my diagnoses; not seldom
I'll miss it as the culprit nevertheless!
