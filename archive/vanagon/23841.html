Subject: Clutch problems AGAIN!

Last December my dad and I replaced the clutch in my '84 Vanagon.  The 
seal was in pretty bad shape then, so we pried it out and I cleaned the 
place it goes by scraping with a piece of wood and some scotch pad and 
acetone until it came clean.  Now, it appears that that seal is leaking 
again -- this is my best guess as the symptoms are the same and there's a 
drop of oil at the front of the engine where a drop might fall out of the 
clutch housing.  I'm very sad and frustrated.  I would like to pull the 
tranny myself -- I don't think my dad's going to be very happy to help me 
again.  Has anyone had much success using a tranny jack?  Is this what I 
need? What might cause that seal to go again?  Did _I_ screw it up?  Is 
there any way to clean the clutch disk and use it, or do I _have_ to buy 
a new one?

Thanks for any help on this.
