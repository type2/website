I made my own for $1.00. Just regular pexiglass, will never break and looks
great. BTW I was supposed to send someone a template and when I lost my
files I lost their e-mail and address. Please send it again if you still
want it.

&gt; Subject: New Skylight anyone? $45.00 + Shipping
&gt; Date: Friday, May 09, 1997 9:33 AM
&gt; 
&gt; My skylight is all beat up and leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; I needed a new one and searched around all over the net.
&gt; My result is a new VW Skylight assembly. The best price I have found is 
&gt; $125.00 and up.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't need a whole assembly, just a replacement skylight.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I am nuts, but there must be some other folks who are in the same 
&gt; situation. 
&gt; 
&gt; That is well over my budget.  I found a plastic fabricator who will 
&gt; design a replacement skylight &quot;the acrylic part only&quot; in quantity 100 
&gt; units for $45.00 each.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there 99 others who need one?  It's a bit pricey, but much less than 
&gt; the unit.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems like creating a mold  and such is the bulk of the cost.
&gt; 
&gt; It will have a slightly different design:
&gt;  same footprint and dimensions
&gt;  stronger edges
&gt;  gray tint
&gt;  be made of PETG
&gt;  More shatter resistant than Acrylic
&gt;  non-yellowing more scratch resistant than polycarbonate
&gt; 
&gt; This is a call for interest NOT an order form!
&gt; 
&gt; If you are interested in a replacement /spare /whatever skylight at that 
&gt; price.
&gt; If I get &gt; 100 confirmations, we may be able to reduce the price some...?
&gt; please email me with the following if you are interested:
