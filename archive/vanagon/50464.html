&gt;      I have sitting in my garage a 1980 H2O Vanagon.  Here's the problem.  The
&gt; guy who owns it doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a new tranny.  I
&gt; checked the shift linkage and nosecone, and the C/V joints, all are OK.  There
&gt; is no forward movement.  Seems that the tranny is shot.  I looked around for a
&gt; replacement and the cheapest used I could find for this model is $425.  I was
&gt; wondering if an older Air Cooled BUS transaxle would fit.  I used to do swaps
&gt; in my Bug all the time between older and newer transaxles and all it usually
&gt; required was a nose cone swap.  Can I do the same with the Vanagon or is it too
&gt; different?
&gt; 
Call Weddle Engineering and request their flyer.  They have all the used
parts for converting an older Bus IRS to the newer style.  It'll just cost
you a phone call and they'll send it out pdq.  Their ad is listed in
recent Hot VW's.
