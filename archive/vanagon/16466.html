Subject: Thom's Leaving

Thom, if you're leaving, this is really a bummer. What about AOL from home? What
exactly is your boss searching on to spy on you?

Hey Mr Gerry, maybe we can have a &quot;stealth mode&quot; for the list that replaces the 
word &quot;vanagon&quot; in the address with &quot;unixadmin&quot; or some such crap.

-Erik, who'd like to have a 911 like Thom and be one of the cool kids.
