I think bus drivers are more aware that they are strapped to the front
like an Aztec sacrifice.  People in the beastie boats with 6 yards of
hood in front really don't give damn.

Also, I notice that the worst parkers are people are the people in the
beastie boats!

I parallel parked my '67 bus one time in San Francisco, by Fisherman's
Wharf with such speed and precision that I actualyy got a round of 
applause from both the spectators and passengers!
