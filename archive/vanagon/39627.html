Subject: Helping VWoA

Hi Volks,
   I've just been invited as a representative of LiMBO to join a host of
other prominate VW people at a meeting at VWoA headquarters in Auburn
Hill,MI.  Needless to say I'm excited.
    But I didn't write this to rub it in your face.  The purpose of the
meeting is to hear from some show promoters, the assorted national VW clubs
and VW publications to here what we have to say about what VW needs to
improve its image and hopfully propel it back into the statis it had years
ago.
    This is your chance to sound off on what you think needs improvement
and what you like about VW today, no matter how small you think it is.  I'm
looking for your imput so I can offer it to the big wigs at VW at the
meeting Mat 2nd and 3rd.  Please E-mail me directly at limbo_at_bcn_dot_net.  I'll
compile all your input and try to offer them to VW.  I hope you can take a
minute and write me.  This is the time.  I'll write in again a remind
everyone before I leave on the trip.  Thanks to all.  I hope we can make an
impact on the Volks at VW, because frankly I think if they don't do
something soon, VWoA might not be around to long into the next century.
Take care.
