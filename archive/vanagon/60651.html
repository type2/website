Subject: Re: Rear hatch lock revisited

Jeff,

On our 87, the drill is to put the rear latch key slot in the vertical
position.   Then when the looks are power-unlocked, the rear hatch is then
openable by just pushing the latch.  

 HOWEVER - sometimes, when I've tried to open by key (when it was in the
wrong position, or maybe when the power locks were in the locked position -
I forget),  I've had trouble opening it, with the symptom that it feels
like it almost catches, as you describe.    The solution has been to cycle
the power locks, after which it will open.    I have a dim memory that I
once tightened the external allen screws holding the latch assembly on the
door to fix it - so you might try that.   Otherwise, sounds like
exploratory surgery is indicated.

&gt;Thank you to everybody who responded to my question yesterday regarding
&gt;the lock on my rear hatch. They were all very helpful. After reading all
&gt;the responses, I did some further investigation and have some follow-up
&gt;questions:
&gt;
&gt;My van is a '90 Westy with power door locks. I noticed if the front
&gt;doors are locked the key will unlock the rear hatch. If the front doors
&gt;are not locked I can't figure out how to open the rear hatch, key or no
&gt;key.
&gt;
&gt;Any hints now, my friends? :-)
