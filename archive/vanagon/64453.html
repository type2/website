Subject:      Gas spill

Hello all,

Every time I fill the gas tank on my '84 Westy, gas shoots out before the
auto shut-off on the pump kicks in.  The main problem with this (beside gas
on the ground and on the side of my van) is that my tank never fills all the
way.  I only get about 3/4 of a tank before the gas spills out.
Anyone have any ideas on how to correct this??

Also, I'm about to attempt to take out the sliding door window to fix a rust
spot, any suggestions on the best way of taking the window out? I really
don't want to break it!

Thanks,
Mike D.
