Harry,

Thanks for the message on platinum plugs. How did you know you were getting 
excessive gap? I have 35k miles on my 90 and have not changed plugs. Seems to be
running well.

Since I have just gotten on this group, was the problem of &quot;carb icing&quot; with the
fuel injected engines discussed earlier? I had this problem and it nearly drove 
me nuts until a regional service rep let me know what was happening. Cleared up 
at no cost under the 50k mile pollution deal.

Anyone have problems with the rear heater in the 90? Found that it is made by 
some French outfit and looks like it. Rotten to the core!

Also experiencing a VERY loud noise from the radiator fan. Can't find any 
obvious problems like interference. Are the bearings a problem in the fan?

Good to know there is a vast amount of knowledge available here. BTW how do you 
get so much stuff on the net. This is a busy place!
