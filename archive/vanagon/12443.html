Subject: RE: V-6 Buick in Bus?

I've talked to the owner/driver of a 84 Vanagon/Buick V-6, but I didn't get
to see it.  He loves it (&quot;There are no hills.&quot;) but he would never do it
again.  E.g. distributor needed to move to the other end of the engine, 
otherwise it would sit right where the rear hatch latch wants to be.

He sold me the 2.2liter Porsche six I first put in my Vanagon; that engine
was in his '7x breadloaf when he was stopped doing 93 towing a trailer.
He tried to talk the trooper out it on grounds of impossibility, but the
trooper said &quot;Don't try to shuck me -- I heard that thing before you
shut it off.&quot;
