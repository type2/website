David Kao asks:
&gt; &gt;&gt;BTW when considering head replacement remember a factory VW rebuilt 
&gt; &gt;&gt;long-block is about $2200.  Labor extra.  That's the route I'm going 
&gt; &gt;&gt;when the time comes.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Is this rebuilt long block shipped from VWOA or is it done locally by
&gt; dealers? 

Done by the Big Boys, VWOA then trucked to the dealer.  
MediVan (a regional transportation provider, uses about 85 VW vans 
due to the interior dimensions) has reported very good results with 
the VW rebuilds for water-cooleds.
