Subject: HELP! ANYONE IN LA?

                                           11:10 AM            7/12/96

Sorry about the crossposting (why do I think a lot of mail is going to start
with this type of statement?  8)).

Another cry for assistance!  Is there anyone on LA who could check a split bus
for me reasonably quickly?  Its apparently in a shop in Compton.  Please email
me if you could help out....

Rob K.
