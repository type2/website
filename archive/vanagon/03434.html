&gt; More hints on the silver secret mystery:
&gt; 
&gt; I have an '82 Westy L, with the gas heater and green knob, and it ALSO has
&gt; the silver 12V connector.
&gt; 
&gt; My sister has an '80 Westy non-L, no gas heater, and she has the silver
&gt; secret, too.
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked at the wiring diagrams in the Haynes, Bentley and Clymer manuals,
&gt; and can't find a trace of it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
Have you perchance had an opportunity to use your silver secret? I am
convinced now more than ever that the silver secret had a production run
of three years (80-82) and appeared only in air cooled Vanagon
westies....but remain stumped on what its purpose might have been.....DC&gt;
