Subject: neat old bus manual find

Hi busers,

I was in a silly used bookstore/50s memorabilia place here in Ann Arbor
yesterday and found a book &quot;36 &amp; 40 H.P. Volkswagen Transporters Workshop
Manual.&quot;  It's a '67 reprint of a '63 book published by Scientific
Publications of Australia.  I paid $27.50, not too bad (my brooklands
reprint of an old English manual was $30 plus shipping); the guy who
had the shop said first editions of this book go for like $100.  Anyone
else seen one of these?

Anyway, it's pretty cool, has quite a bit of &quot;use VW tool 245a to
check the spring plate inclination&quot; but seems to have some more detail
than my Clymer and Brooklands and I don't need to wade through useless
stuff about ball joints etc. :-)  The photos are I'm sure lifted right
out of standard VW dealer shop manuals:  the guys in ties taking out
engines, etc.  (What, you mean you _don't_ wear a tie when working on your
bus?!).

Interestingly, it mentions a &quot;back up light&quot; below the driver's side
taillight,  with the switch in the shift rod.  I've never seen this in
an early bus, was it some kind of Aus spec?

My favorite sentence so far:  &quot;The closed body of clean and pleasing
countours offers extremely low air resistance.&quot;
