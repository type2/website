Subject: propane pilot light

So Kirk Evans says:
&gt; 	The pilot light for my fridge (84 westfalia), blows out
&gt; when I drive. Is this a safety feature, and if it is, how do I
&gt; defeat it. (don't worry I carry a fire extinguisher)
&gt; 		kirk
&gt; 

I thought you weren't suppose to drive with it on while driving and
were suppose to use the DC power to keep the fridge cold when
driving.  Works for me.
