Subject: Re: plan ahead for trip...

&gt;At least one person has mentioned to me that it is illegal to drive
&gt;in Canada without verification of autoregistration.  Can any of
&gt;our Canadian friends on the list, or Americans living near
&gt;the Canadian border tell us if/how that is enforced?
&gt;
That was me.  Give me a few days to make some phone calls, and I'll post the
information when I have it.

Michael
