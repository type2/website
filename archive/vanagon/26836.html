Subject: Re: Whooaaah Nellie!

&gt;Whooaaah Nellie!  I went to my FLAPS last night to price a
&gt;new O2 sensor for my 89 vanagon and they quoted me $120!!!!!!
&gt;Does that sound right to y'all?  I just put on in a friend's
&gt;car for 25 bucks!  Granted the one I priced last night was a
&gt;Bosch and his was some no-name-whatever.
&gt;
&gt;I haven't had the courage to look anywhere else yet.  Any suggestions?
&gt;Should I be scared to call around?

Yes it does sound right, as mine (for an '87) cost just short of $200 with
the mitigating facts that the bucks were Canuck and the location was St.
John's Newfoundland (which has to make it more expensive, right?). So
figure around $135 US equivalent. Sounds like I didn't get taken at all.
