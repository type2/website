Subject: Re: VW-'71 BUS-QUESTION ABOUT MOUNTING BOLTS

sm&gt; &gt;&gt;do I really need to get the upper left bolt on?
sm&gt;
sm&gt; &gt; I've never used that bolt-don't think I've ever even seen one
sm&gt; &gt;installed. 50k miles on 2 vw's, engine hasn't fallen out yet... I
sm&gt; would &gt;think that the rear engine support for '68-71 busses makes
sm&gt; this fourth bolt &gt;even more redundant than it normally is.
sm&gt;
sm&gt;
sm&gt; Yup-- until you hit that REALLY, REALLY big bump you weren't
sm&gt; expecting. Then you'll find out just how much VW engines resemble
sm&gt; aircraft engines. Obviously you haven't hit it yet, and maybe you
sm&gt; never will. What the hell, why pay an extra $4.95 for a lousy bolt
sm&gt; you'll PROBABLY never use?
sm&gt;
        Hmm. Hit lots of BIG bumps. Engine still there. How big a bump do I
need to hit before the 3 engine/tranny bolts and the 3 engine/rear-mount
bolts go? Just curious, _obviously_ I'll have to put that bolt in  before
that bump so my engine doesn't fall on the road... but in the meantime
$4.95 might buy me something more useful, like snake oil. How about some
bump size statistics for our brethren in pre-'68 busses? Smaller bumps for
them before the engine falls out? They need to know too, you know. BTW, is
this a big bump that'll bust my case? If so, who cares how many bolts I've
got...

Peace,
