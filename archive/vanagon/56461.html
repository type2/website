Subject: RE: Tranny synthetic oil? 

I've been using synthetic for the last 5 years,

No problems.

Added benefit of much easier shifting during colds weather (-35 F).

&gt;Guten Tag, all

&gt;I can't remember if this topic has been
&gt;covered or not, but what has been the
&gt;general experience with those of you
&gt;using something like, oh, say Redline MTL
&gt;in the tranny?  How noticeable is the 
&gt;change in shifting?
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
