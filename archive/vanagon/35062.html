Subject: NHVWC Show

Hi all!! Am now 4 days behind in reading the digests, but an anouncement.
Get those calendars out!
The New Hampshire Volkswagen Club will be having VW Show!! The date is
Sunday, June 9, 1996 at the Hopkinton, New Hampshire Fairgrounds, strangely
enough in Hopkinton, NH, from 9 am to 3 pm. As more details develop, I'll
post them for your perusal. If anyone has questions before, please feel
free to e-mail me directly. I'm a member of the NHVWC and will help you as
best I can!! Hope to see lots of you there and maybe, just maybe, my 67
Deluxe will be there too!!
        &quot;I go slow, therefore I drive my bus&quot;
           Mike Elkavitch
