Hello Larry,

I can't believe this is the second time I've agreed with you.  I have
ample funds, but no matter what other vehicles I may purchase my
trustworthy '86 Syncro stays &quot;still she dies&quot;.  Besides, I couldn't even
begin to explain to my dog, Tuge, why his favorite mode of
transportation wasn't waiting in the driveway.

I can understand why some folks question keeping a large 'wind hole'
with a tiny engine.  My point is that until one has made love, partyed,
and sat all alone.  Until one has written his/her poetry in a far away
place that only a VW van will take one.  If one has to explain it, there
is no explanation.  

God knows I've tried and cried.

'Nuff said.

&gt; &gt; Now, my question is, should a person sell what they _REALLY_ like just
&gt; &gt; because it is &quot;time to let it go&quot; (before major problems - like the heads).

&gt; Is there really anything at any price that can compare with the Vanagon
&gt; (Westy or Weekender)? Even if you replaced the engine entirely (VW H2O,
&gt; Subaru or whatever) every 5 years you're still ahead of the cost of a
&gt; &quot;new&quot; van (especially a new EV). Besides with a Vanagon you get to meet
&gt; such great people.
