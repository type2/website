&gt; I keep hearing about the 'heads' going on water-cooled 1.9 and 2.1 engines.
&gt;  Is it inevitable?

I think so, although can be postponed with regular coolant changes.
  
&gt;  My 84 GL has done 183,000 miles but a recon engine was put in 75,000 miles
&gt;  ago in 1991 (probably due to the head thing:-).
&gt;  Does this head thing re-occur regularly or is a once only fix?

I haven't heard of anything to indicate that the corrosion could somehow stop
after changing the heads.  The process should just start over again from
scratch.  Unless...... VW could have changed the metalurgy in the new heads
to make them less prone to corrosion. 

Todd Francis has had his heads (well, his Vanagon's heads) coated with a
ceramic material to avoid corrosion.  This process sounds promising, but so
far he only has 30,000 miles on the heads, so it's too early to tell.
