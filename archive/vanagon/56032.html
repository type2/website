Tim, maybe they didn't offer the '84 up Non-GL Camper in Canada?

There were &quot;standard&quot; Westy's up till about '83 or so here in the US that had
everything a full &quot;deluxe&quot; westy had (including the sink), except the stove
and the fridge. On the Standards the icebox replaced the fridge. This was a
practice carried over from the &quot;deluxe&quot; and the &quot;standard&quot; westy's of the
mid-to late '70's. 

In '84 they changed the interior and dropped the sink from the &quot;standard&quot; or
&quot;Non-GL&quot; Westy line.

that's not the case on the '84-up US spec non-GL campers. On '83 down, yes,
but on '84 up, no.

Not here in the US. 

&gt; The Multivans up here are badged with 'Multivan' on rear hatch.

the '90-'91 Multivans here say the same thing, but, the Multivan was only
offered '90-'91 here in the US.

&gt;Weekender was an option (not a production model) prior to '88, and no
&gt;'weekender' badge was on hatch, likely 'GL' only. 

same here.

&gt;why all the concern anyhoo??

what.... y'all ain't getting sick of this are ya????   ;&lt;)
naaa...
