Subject: I smell a PLAID rat

Just a little note, that might apply to a person on this list
or might apply to nobody and represent dumb coincidence.
Called to order the fabric today for those who have voiced interest.
Funny thing, out of the blue, somebody had called the Trim Shop
yesterday wanting to buy both rolls.  Now frankly the only
people in the world who likely know the Trim Shop has this stuff
read this list or remotely likely read it on the WWW page.
But I'm betting the person is on the list and wanted to sell it
at a substantial markup.  Unfortunately for them I guess they
had to arrange financing and were going to get back to the Trim
Shop, but I BEAT THEM TO IT, BOTH ROLLS, ALL MINE, and for exactly
what I paid plus shipping available to anyone on this list.
People have 30 yds spoken for, if anyone else is interested email
me now, as I am only going to take both rolls if I get orders
for 40+ yds, I have them both spoken for if I want them, they
are measuring them and will get back to me with exact amounts
Monday.  And if this drives the price up for me and the rest,
may the guilty party if indeed one of us have bad VW bus karma
for evermore.

John,
A bit bitter

OH PS, since shipping this stuff all the way to me on the east
coast sounds stupid only to ship it again, a lot likely back
to the other coast.  I'm shipping it all to a good friend in
Wichita, KS.  From there he will either drive it back to me
as he is soon visiting or he will send it out COD to everyone
who wants it.  Again for anyone just catching up, this is
indeed late 70's  Yellow, and Green on 2&quot; wide plaid with 0.5&quot;
wide orange and black.  (I checked a picture this is correct)
Is is usually stock in Marigold (Yellow) and some orange Buses
but would look equally good in any orange, and possible in
green buses.  After all if you can't have exactly what it came
with this is close as you'll likely ever find.
