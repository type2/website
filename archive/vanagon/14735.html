The only critical thing is to bleed the radiator, this should
solve your problems, pull the grill, it should be obvious how,
1/4 twist screws I think. lool on one side on top for larke
bleeder valve, looks like a tire valve but big, like an A/C fill
valve, press till H20 appears, problem solved. If you need manual
pages email me direct with fax no.

Should probably do with heater core open, use your rear heater
if it isn't locked to make do, we ran our '86 for a month with a
bubble locking the front radiator but not the heater, no adverse
affects, when they did the head retorque recall later, all was still
OK
