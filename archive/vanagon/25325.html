Subject: Re: 67' Bus Valance, What is this?

Rusty whipped out the big Dictionary:

VALANCE:
&quot;1. An ornamental drapery hung across a top edge, as of a bed, table, or
canopy. 2. A short drapery, decorative board, or metal strip mounted
especially across the top of a window to conceal structural fixtures.&quot;

It's a good thing that you didn't ask what a VW valence was.

VALENCE:
3. *Psychology* The attraction or repulsion that an individual feel toward a
specific object or event. 4. The capacity of something to unite, react or
interact with something else.

A straight honest answer is that I can only guess that the *Valance* might
be the 2&quot; strip of laminated fake wood that runs along the top of the
windows on the drivers side starting behind the driver's head and runs the
length of the bus back to the rear most overhead cabinet. This strip is
located between the edge of the wood headliner and the top of the jealousy
(*sp) windows.

*I always mis spell this word. Sorry.

&gt;What and where is the valance located on a 67' westy pop-top?
&gt;
&gt;I couldn't answer this question for my friend.  Thanks in advance!!
