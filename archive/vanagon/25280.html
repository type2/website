&gt;	But towing with all four on the ground, rolling, would seem to

The current plan is to attach a tow-bar to the front bumper and not to steer
it.

&gt;	Or does the Synchro manual specificly tell you to never coast
&gt;down hills or roll in neutral??

No mention of not coasting.  I think the warning in the owner's manual to
only have the Syncro only &quot;towed&quot; on a flatbed is assuming the only other
tow-truck option is two wheels raised and two wheel on the ground.  I haven't
seen a reasonable arguement yet to preclude 4 wheels on the ground (I'm still
considering SStone's advice).
