&gt;I just recently faced the same problem and, near as I can tell, you are out
&gt;of
&gt;luck.  The battery box is VERY small, only 7&quot; tall.  The ONLY battery which
&gt;will fit under the front seat is a group 42, which is NOT available as a 
&gt;deep cycle; only as a conventional starter battery.  
&gt;
&gt;I posted a query on this list asking if anyone knew where to get a deep
cycle
&gt;battery which would fit and got no responses.  The only &quot;fix&quot; is to get out
&gt;the old cutting torch and deepen the battery box.  For the moment, I just
&gt;gave
&gt;up and purchased a &quot;conventional&quot; group 42 battery.  If all goes well with
my
&gt;'80 Westy (a recent acquisition) maybe next year I will perform the required
&gt;surgery.
&gt;
&gt;

Actually,  agroup 41 is larger than a 42 and it will fit under the seat.
 Depending on how often it is drained down, will last about 2 years.  For the
extra capacityof a larger battery, I don ot think it is worth the effort.
 Remember that if you do modify the compartment for a larger battery, you
need to secure it in the box in case of rollover or something.
