Subject:       Bike Rack

Hey:

Well the time to move out to calif. is soon upon us and we realized 
we had nowhere to put the bikes. My question is, is there a bike rack 
that we can use for the Vanagon (84). I looked at the top mounted 
racks, but they were tooo expensive (or I'm too cheap) and the 
thought of battling Midwestern Wind gusts with an extra 3 feet of 
&quot;Sail&quot; didn't sound to  good. Area there any that will fit on the 
hatch area?

Thanks
Matt
