From: Richard Kurtz &lt;rmk_at_sky_dot_net&gt;
Subject: Bob Hoover's Sermons

Now that Bob and Grendel are safely back home, his fertile mind and
prolific keyboard ard active again, answering our many questions about the
meaning of life and especially about keeping our museum pieces running for
the remainder of this century or forever.

If you don't save Bob's epistles yourself, you can usually find the latest
additions on &quot;The Sermon's of Bob Hoover&quot; web page.  It is located at
http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/.  Read the account of Bob's &quot;Hair-Ball Run&quot;
to Washington State, to rescue fair maiden Grendel from wasting the rest
of her life culturing mushrooms in a field.
