Subject: Black spots on Carat alloys...solved!

Well, the mystery of the black spots (round bursts of undercoating sprayed)
on Carat alloys has been solved. 
Awhile back, I posted to the list to see if anyone elses alloys had this
affliction.
A couple listmembers replied to me and said their alloys were suffering from
this same epidemic, but the cause of the &quot;disease&quot; was unknown.

Well, common sense prevailed, an autopsy was performed, and the results were
amazing  (yeah, right...)
Anyway, the wheel with the black spots was in the spare tire carrier when the
vehicle was undercoated at the dealer, and undercoating shot thru the round
holes in the spare tire carrier, creating black circles on the wheels. 
The cure?   mineral spirits. 

Amazing what the human brain is capable of when you actually use it....  :&lt;)
