&gt;&gt;I've often wondered about this: Do Buses tend to get pulled over more than

     Hell yes!!

I don't mean really
&gt;&gt;obvious, Grateful Dead style buses, just regular ones.

     No such thing as a &quot;regular&quot; one -- you're obviously 
     a dealer if you're not driving a Caravan...

I'd hate to have to
&gt;&gt;deal with this, as I have been known to transport various &quot;magical&quot;
&gt;&gt;substances for friends.

     Take a tip from a viper, pal: don't travel with anything.

I like those Owsley Bear stickers, too, but I
&gt;&gt;wonder how many folks are hip to the meaning of them. . .??

     Every narc this side of Boston, for starters...

&gt;I have been pulled over several times in Utah by troopers who all say 
&gt; the same thing &quot;I didn't see your front plate so I wanted to check , 
&gt; by the way can I see your license and registration&quot; it almost sounds 
&gt; rehearsed.  I am not your typical 'dead head', short hair, 
&gt; conservative white male, and my van was a restored very clean 71 with 
&gt; National Guard plates.

    What they're trying to say is, &quot;Hi, we're immature, insecure
    white assholes and we need to roust your shaggy ass to provide
    ourselves with some sense of self-worth. Plus, we'll look
    busy and maybe we'll get another swell 2.5% pay raise this year!&quot;

The UHP has had a lot of success with profiles 
&gt; in catching drug runners on I-15 and I-70 but is taking a lot of heat 
&gt; from the ACLU for it.  Someone out there has a signature block that 
&gt; says something along the line of if &quot;a nation that sacrifices freedom 
&gt; for security achieves neither&quot;.  Amen brother.

    To live outside the law, you must be honest.
