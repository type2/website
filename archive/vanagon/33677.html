Subject: Re: drive it!

first of all,  the 54 kombi has been regularly driven for the past year and a
third,  over which time it has become more and more servicable as more bits
were fixed.    When we moved in the summer, we loaded tons of stuff in it and
hauled it to the new abode (6 miles each way).  It has 16&quot; wheels and tube
tires, original bumpers, semiphores etc.  But i live in a small town, and
only a couple times has anyone noticed how wierd it is.  Its just an old bus
that needs paint.

Before the move, it had a tarp over it (but was damp - this is western WA),
now it gets parked in the garage and only driven when its dry out.  else it'd
rust  :(.  I felt bad leaving it w/ just a tarp, but I had no choice.    Im
not paranoid, but i wouldnt want to leave it on a street in a big city.  Too
easy to had bits ripped off.   Dont drive around with good taillights in my
old 59, had broken lenses and they werent stolen.  (someone had put later
taillights in the 61 deluxe -DPO!)

Ive seen more rust appear on the 61 in the two years ive had it. - in this
climate garaging makes a lot of difference.

There is a beautiful blue and white 21 window ive seen in seattle
occasionally, which is all original and has been garage kept since new.   Id
rather see something like that than one restored.   And they drive it :)
