Well, actually, no.  Set it to pull air from outside.  As it goes over 
the coils, they remove the moisture from the air.  You are then blowing
dry air over the windshield.  The moisture evaporates (if liquid) or
sublimates (if frozen) much faster.

If you draw air from inside the car, it's partly humidified by the moisture 
from the breath of the occupants, as well as from the moisture on the 
windshield.
