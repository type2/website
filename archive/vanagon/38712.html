Subject:  FS 82 Westy diesel: Update


The diesel pump is now fixed (the shop was able to reseal the old one) 
and since it was a lot less expensive than I thought, I am able to sell 
the van now for $4100. 

In my last post I forgot to mention that the van also had a new exhaust 
system installed in summer of 93.

All the other data are still the same (see below).

&gt; Hi listmembers,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm back. Some of you will remember the questions that I had last year 
&gt; about diesels and air-conditioning (living in Dallas and having become 
&gt; father of twin girls last June).
&gt; 
&gt; The girls are the main reason why I am finally thinking about selling the 
&gt; westy before the summer. Here goes:
&gt; 
&gt; 82 Westfalia diesel, beige
&gt; 
&gt; 101k miles
&gt; 
&gt; Excellent condition, no rust, only dent is on front bumper under license 
&gt; plate (so it's not visible). Neighbors think it's only a few years old.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything works (even the gas fridge).
&gt; 
&gt; 5 new tires (Continental), 1500 miles old.
&gt; 
&gt; All new hoses in Summer 93.
&gt; 
&gt; Remanufactured cylinder head, new injectors, new glow plugs in January 95 
&gt; (at 96k miles). All new belts.
&gt; 
&gt; New starter (Fall 95)
&gt; 
&gt; Invested about $3000 since January 95 (tires, cylinder head, injectors, 
&gt; glow plugs, starter). Have all receipts.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now, the diesel pump has a very slow leak but I am going to have 
&gt; that fixed. The van will have a new Bosch diesel pump when I sell it.
&gt; 
&gt; Asking: $4800/neg
&gt; 
&gt; Without the new diesel pump: $3800
&gt; 
&gt; Please e-mail me directly (jrieger_at_mail.smu_dot_edu),
&gt; 
&gt; Joerg
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.:
&gt; Some listmembers (David Schwarze, Dean Aukes) have seen the van.
