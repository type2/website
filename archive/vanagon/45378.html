Subject: Rebulding a '74 motor


Ok, here's my problem.  My engine is about to die.  The valves are
clattering like crazy and it runs horribly.  I found an engine from the
same year bus at the
local junkyard for 450 bucks.  It has everything on it except the
carbs-including exhaust, alternator, cooling tin and everything else.
They also claim it has been compression tested and that it runs fine.  No
one knows how many miles are on it.

I plan to buy this motor, pull my old one and rebuild it while driving on
the junkyard engine.  Then, after rebuilding my old engine, I'll put it
back in and sell the junkyard engine.  Am, I crazy?  Has anyone had any
success with doing something like this before?  What are some things to
look out for on the junkyard engine that could tell me the condition of
the engine?

Thanks,
Craig

PS I'm sure once I start rebuilding my engine I'll have plenty more
questions aobut that as well, so start thinking of some answers now :)
