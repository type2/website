Gerry:

        Taking out the diesel motor connected to the tranny is the
only way to go, and quite easy too.

        I jack up the rear end about eight inches and put the rear 
wheels down on ramps which are about that height. Disconnect 
the gear shift rod, reverse gear backup light switch wiring, CV 
joints, and all hosing and wiring with respect to the motor. Don't 
forget the oil dipstick tube, by unscrewing it where it bolts to the 
metal elbow.  Put a piece of wood under the oil pan to distribute 
the load of the motor that will be pushing down on the jack that 
you are now putting under the motor. (The diesel oil pan is very
delicate, so the wood is a must! ! !  Unbolt the 2 inch diameter 
support pipes where they connect to the chassis, but leave them
connected to the support arms/motor mounts. While your assistant
operates the jack, you can hold on to the pipes close at hand to 
the rubber motor mounts and steady the mass as it is lowered. 
Leave the most forward mount on the transmission (which is 
pivotable) connected to the van chassis. This mount will act like a 
hinge and allow you to slowly lower both engine and tranny together.
When engine is on the ground, then place the jack under the tranny
and unbolt the mount on the forward end of the tranny.  When 
everything is on the ground, you can slide the motor out the back.
I can't remember if I had to take the engine support arm and pipe
off of the left side, and rotate the motor a little in order to get
sufficient clearance.

        Does you van have a diesel auxiliary heater? If so, I have a
few comments I'll make, on that conversion back to gasoline.

        Transfer your fuel pump over from the '84. The diesel doesn't
have electrical power for the gasoline fuel pump, I don't think.  I
suppose you can block off the diesel fuel return fuel line, as you
won't need that for the gas engine, will you?

        I suppose you will be selling the motor and tranny from the
diesel?

Good luck
