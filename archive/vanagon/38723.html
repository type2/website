&gt;Now, finally the question. What book do all of you on the list
&gt;recommend as the best all around book for the Vanagon. And next, what
&gt;book is a good one for under a zillion dollars (I expect the &quot;best one
&gt;to be way, way too expensive.)   8-)

Unfortunately, ther is no choice here.  Bentley is the only repair book for
wasserboxer Vanagons.  Unfortunately (again) they are expensive at about $70
to $85.

&gt;And another question.  Where can I locate these books?

A catalog company for car books, Motorbooks International (call the 800#
information operator for their number) sells them.  Also, JC Whitney at
(312)431-6102 sells them (no. 16BZ6901N) for $69.99 + significant shipping &amp;
&quot;handling&quot; charges.
