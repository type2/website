&gt; Bottom Line codes...
&gt; UP = country built for (do you mean US?)

After reviewing several of these, I believe the prevailing
sentiment is that &quot;U&quot; is for U.S.A. and the second letter
specifies the actual port of entry.  So far there has just
been speculation, but UH, UT, UL and now UP have been
mentioned.  Best guess is the port closest to the dealer
delivering the vehicle was specified.
