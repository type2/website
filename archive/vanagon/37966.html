Subject: BUG-OUT 34

Bug-Out 34 is being held on april 21, 1996 in Dinwiddie VA at the 
virginia motorsports park.  I'm organizing a group to head down from 
Fredericksburg VA in the morning.  All VW's are welcome.  If your 
interested in the caravan or are attending the show but can't make the 
caravan and would like to meet up with us at the show let me know and 
I'll send the details.
