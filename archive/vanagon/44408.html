Subject: new low milage gas

        Hi Yas

        Has any one here in California had any problems, 
        with the newly formulated gas in yer busses???

        Besides less gas milage!

        The rumer I know about, so far, is only with 2 stroke engines,
        lawn mower, blower motors, ect. The problem seems to be with 
        carberator componets, not bieing compatable with the fuel, 
        ( the fuel eats up the gaskets).

        The vary reason I'm asking this question, I adverted the dredded 
        engine compartment fire reciently. The carb. was leaking from the 
        float chamber gasket, I can't say the fuel is the problem, but....

        Dose any one know if this will be a problem with bus carbs. 
        Or is it not a problem, I have a 28PICT-1 with carb kit in hand.

        TIA          Laurie
