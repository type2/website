&gt;By CC to the list I am inviting any and all suggestions, advice, warnings

Actually, I prefer jackstands myself.  Not only are they adjustable, but
ramps can take some power to get up on them, not to mention the risk of
hitting the ceiling or garage door with the top of the bus.  Buy some good,
sturdy jack stands and you should be set.  One thing that I do that isn't
mentioned a whole lot is to shake and bump the bus a few good licks BEFORE
you get under it or take the wheels off.  If it's unsteady or going to fall,
THIS is the time you want to find out about it, and not when you're
underneath prying on your CV bolts with your hex/torx/3 square Craftsman/
SnapOn/Hazett wrench.  :-)
