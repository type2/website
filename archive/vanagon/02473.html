Subject: Re: aerodynamics; Skidplates

I *have* installed giant sheets of aluminum alloy under my camper, but not
for aerodynamics. I did it so I could bash down on top of rocks while four
wheeling and not hurt the underside. I think I had 3/8 inch thick sheets of
6061 T-6 aluminum sheets with countersunk allen head bolts. 

Any Syncro with the air dams on it isn't really an off road vehicle. You have
to remove the air dams from under the bumper.
