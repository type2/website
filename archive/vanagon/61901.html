Subject: Raised Roof on Weekender...(Fiberglass) OK?

Anyone having experience putting on and living with a raised fiberglass roof
with bed on a Vanagon, please let me know of your experiences.  I've looked
at putting on a poptop but it sounds pretty awful.

I've seen a few Vanagons with raised roofs a la North American vans, and
they look pretty stupid, but I really need an extra bed up top, and cannot
afford a Westy or Multivan.


I'd like to know about cost, (BC Canada) of having it done, how it worked
out, if anybody has a bed package up there, and mostly what does it do to
the van in crosswind situations?

Thanks

Ed
