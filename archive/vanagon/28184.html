Subject: Re: seatbelts + airbags

With all this talk about seat-belts, I thought this would be a good bunch to 
help me with a problem I am having with the local po-lice and my '65 Notchback.

About three weeks ago, I was pulled over for having a burned-out headlamp. Fair 
enough, it was definitely out and I was being a bit lazy about replacing it 
anyways. Part of the reason is that the 6-volt lamps are a special order item at 
the local FLAPS. While the officer had me pulled over, he decided to do a 
complete safety inspection. I dunno if this is for real, or just a way for the 
officers to get consent to look for drugs and guns,etc. 

Anyways, he discovered that there are no rear seatbelts installed, and wrote me 
up. I explained that the car never had *any* when it left the factory, and that 
I had installed the front ones myself. He said that they were required on all 
cars in MD, and wrote me a work order to install them in 30 days or my tags will 
suspended. I told him that I thought that the DOT did not require them until 
'68, but to no avail.

I have since replaced the burned out lamp, but not the rear seatbelts. I don't 
feel like installing them, since I rarely even drive the car (1500mi/yr avg) and 
carry passengers even less frequently. Anyone know where I can find 
documentation regarding seatbelt requirements? I did a lame net search under 
DOT, seatbelts,etc.._dot_came up with nothing good...any ideas?

Thanks!
