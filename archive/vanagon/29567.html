Without getting your hopes up, I've gone for 20 minutes easy before the 
clattering stopped. However, to tell what it is, you need to do a good 
listen with a long screwdriver or some stethoscope type device to hear 
WHERE the sound is coming from.  Are you sure it isn't a &quot;knock&quot;. Are you 
sure it's from the heads? See if you can give us a location.
