Subject: Martha's silver secret...

Martha, since you own an 81 westy do you use or have any knowledge of the
silver secret?

The hypotheses (top seven) thus far:

1. Small spare tire air pump plug;

2. Plug to heat coffee  that Germans don't drink while driving;

3. After market installation for seat heater/vibrator;

4. Small travel-light plug to read maps while driving;

5. Unused device used to plug hole where Diesel choke is;

6. Aux. Gas heater-related plug;

7. German trick designed to confuse simple-minded North American VW owners...
