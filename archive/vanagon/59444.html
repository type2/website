Subject: Recall info...

I was just at the local dealer getting a few parts and just for fun, asked
them to
run the VIN number of my (new to me) '88 Westy. Low and behold I found out
that I was inline for a free recall service &quot;PW&quot; The dealer did not know the
details, but said it had something to do with the fuel lines where they come
through the firewall. Does anyone know what this recall was for?

Thanks
Todd
