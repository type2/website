&gt; I get that &quot;clutch drag&quot; problem in my FIAT when its been stood for
&gt; a week or two. I don't think it's a problem, I reckon the gearbox
&gt; oil goes real thick if you don't use it for a few days. Coz the clutch
&gt; it engaged when you start it, the gears in the tranny are turning and
&gt; &quot;dragging&quot; the final drive gears round a little. It goes away after
&gt; a few minutes or so.
&gt; 
&gt; I always put the clutch down when I start the FIAT to give it a little
&gt; more chance of starting.

i've got a '73 128 parked just outside the window that i am sitting next 
to. it's been about 4 months since i started it, maybe i'll do that this 
weekend.

but yes, i always do that too. i think it is the gearbox grease, at least 
it seems that untill i drive it enough to warm up the drivetrain a bit it 
is quite stiff to start, or roll.
