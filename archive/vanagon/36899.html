Subject:  re:Correct tire pressure 

My understanding was that for correct wear, the tire had to contact the ground
in the correct shape. This shape is dependant on tire pressure and load, or
axle weight. IE: The pressure varies for a given load. And further to this, the 
vehicle manufacturer who knows the axle loads, and the type of tire specifies 
the correct pressure for that application. 

For example. My 86 Type II has the same tires  front and back, however, the
weight isn't evnely distributed. VW sez put 35PSI in the front, and 41PSI
in the back. Same Tires! I assume this is due to more wieght in the back.
Further I assume the wieght distribution is directly related to the tire
pressures. That is 35/46ths or 46% front axle, and 42/76ths or 54% on the
back axle.
NOTE: This is speculation, not known facts!

76 Type II/IV/VII


&gt;I recently put a set of 195/60 tires on my 74 Bug. The tire store siad the
&gt;correct pressure should be 32psi both front and rear. Handling was greatly
&gt;improved but ride was stiff and bumpy.  A  friend said to follow the
&gt;manufacture's tire pressure to provide correct ride and steering according to
&gt;the original suspension design. After resetting tire pressure the ride and
&gt;handling felt better. BUT THEN another &quot;expert&quot; said that using the low
&gt;pressure would result in increased tire and suspension wear. As I have just
&gt;replaced the entire front suspension I want to get the most life possible out
&gt;of it. I am now very confused ( my normal state) about what is best and I
&gt;would like to ask if anyone has any advice on the subject. I find the answers
&gt;to questions here to be the best in terms of honesty and correctness. Thanks
&gt;in advance.
