Subject: book on Bosch FI

I came across a good book on Bosch fuel injection systems this weekend:

How to Tune &amp; Modify Bosch Fuel Injection
Ben Watson
Motorbooks International
ISBN 0-87938-570-7
$19.95

Lots of theory as well as troubleshooting techniques. Includes a chapter on
L-Jetronic, the system used on Vanagons.
