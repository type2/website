&gt; &gt;&gt; Thats all I know.  On the slight chance that someone is interested, =
&gt; &gt;I'll
&gt; &gt;&gt; look into it and shipping.

&gt; Sorry All.  That phone # is (907) 488-7448.   I just talked to the fellow
&gt; who owns it and he said that the engine is there and untouched.  But the
&gt; passenger side is pushed all the way in to the center of the van.  He says
&gt; it is quite totaled.  I will look at it this afternoon and post more.

My bets are that if the engine and tranny are okay, that price is a bloody
STEAL!
