[lots about yet a third meta-list]

What you're talking about would be difficult and expensive on the server
side but is easy and free on the client side. Back in days of yore, when
the Knights of the Order of Geekdom were building the Internet, they
invented procmail. A procmail recipe that would filter all the cross-posts
from one list for people who were subscribed to both would be very easy.

Key &quot;man procmail&quot; or consult your local admin.

But: Mr. Skip Montanaro has graciously offered to carry the aircooled list
within the watercooled one on the web page. Those of you who cannot forbear
to read all this verbiage but somehow also cannot bear to open a single
additional email message, can read the whole shebang on the web page and
it'll still look like one list. Thanks, Skip!

Tonight we do the deed. Hugs are in order but goodbyes are not, in my
opinion. Thanks to Gerry for maintaining v_at_l all this time--it's been
better than a college-level course and it's meant a lot to me. Take a bow.

See you on the other side, folks. ;)
