Subject: gas tank

In my area(chicago suburbs) there are a few radiator shops which advertise
&quot;gas tank Renu&quot; which is a process which coats the inside of the tank with
some kind of goo which is impervious to gasoline. It's supposed to work
well (used in restoring old cars and stuff), but never had any personal
experience. I think a friend of mine had it done to a customer's 280SL-I'll
ask tomorrow.

Yours,
yug
