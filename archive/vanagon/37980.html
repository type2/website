&gt; While we're on the subject, i went to see another engine a few weeks back, it
&gt; was said to be a 36Hp but when i was there i saw it had a detachable
&gt; generatorstand. The case looks not the same as a 40 Hp 1200. I must add that
&gt; this engine has never been in a car, it's an industrial engine that powered a
&gt; waterpump or a generator or something, it had a vertex magneto ignition
&gt; (missing) and the generator is empty, it only holds and drives the fan. it is in
&gt; very good condition in terms of an undamaged case, straight tinware, complete,
&gt; and never been abused in a car, could this be the '59 intermediate engine i
&gt; heard about? VW stamped 122 in the case just before the enginenumber, the tag on
&gt; the fanhousing says Type 122, btw, the tag looks the same as in a VW car. All
&gt; tinware is green and that looks like the original paint.
