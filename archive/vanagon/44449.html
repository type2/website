  Vehicle is in fair condition and was a daily driver until it was taken off
  the road in July 1993 (it is not running).  Good for restoration or repair
  to daily driver condition.  1600cc Type I engine, recent shocks, some
  camper equipment (ice box/sink, fold out bed, cabinets - these items were

  registration) and may be viewed on weekends with 3-4 days notice.
  $700 / new owner is responsible for the removing vehicle
