Subject: Re: Noisy lifters

Justin:

I've encountered noisy lifters twice on my Vanagon, both times after
major engine work.  The first time this happened I just drove the
bus around for a few days and eventially the noise went away.

The most recent &quot;noisy lifter&quot; event was last week when I installed
a new engine.  I ran the engine at about 2,000 rpm for about 20 minutes
and the lifters filled up within that break-in period.

I was told that one way to help the lifters pump up quickly was to adjust
them to &quot;zero lash&quot;, which essentially means backing off the adjusting
screw 2 turns.  Then re-adjust once the noise goes away.

&gt; My van sat for a few weeks getting painted and now the lifters are making
