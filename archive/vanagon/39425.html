Wow ! According to Tom Czerniak, Dr. Jack Kevorkian drives a Baywindow...
I was pleasantly amused by the Deadheads/drugs/sterotypes thread of late
but THIS news...well... the possibilities are mindblowing!! (no pun intended 
:)


Let's not forget the terrorists in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, who
came at the good guys in a similar baywindow bus-- the ultimate
getaway vehicle!   :-\
