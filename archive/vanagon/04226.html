Just got home from an aborted trip to Busses by the Bouy....more on
that later....

However, as we were heading up to Maine in the EuroVan, the Boston
&quot;Classic Rock&quot; station began playing the Beatles &quot;Saw Her Standing
There&quot;....you know the one..&quot;She was just seventeen...&quot;

By my math this babe is now about 48 years old!!! Hell she's older
than Martha!!!   ;-)


One last musical observation....before I get off and crash...is it
me or is it getting just a touch &quot;indecent&quot; when you have a 50+
year old guy singing songs 'bout pickin' up sweet young things...
a la Mr. Jagger in his latest release &quot;Love is Strong&quot;...

then again, pickin' up sweet young things at the age of 50 is just
what the doctor might order....


COFFEEEEEEE!!!!!
