Subject: Re: Poor Gas Mileage

I just drove my 85 westy 1400 miles with it getting about 14 mpg! Not
happy at all. I replaced the o2 sensor about 3000- miles ago. It is
blowing black smoke and the power is about 2/3 of what it used to be. I
need to replace the cap and rotor and possibly the plugs. I just put new
wires (belden) on it with no noticeable improvements. Could bad plugs,
cap, rotor cause these problems. I have examined them and they need to be
replaced but they are not in horrible shape. It does seems to run worse
after it warms up. My o2 sensor may be the culprit. Any advice would be
appreciated. Thanks

I want my old westy back

Mike
