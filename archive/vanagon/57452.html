Subject: Check your work!!!!

  Howdy all. This is a happy ending to a boneheaded move. The moral of this,
and most bus stories is CHECK YOUR WORK CAREFULLY!!!!
  I posted earlier about how I had successfully replaced my starter, only to
have my fuel pump die. I suspected the fuel pump because absolutely nothing was
coming out of the pump, but there was some gas in the supply line.
 Well, I replaced the pump, and nothing...Began checking for clogged lines,
blowing out each one, and nothing. tried blowing up into the line into the
tank, and nothing. (Yes, I was VERY careful when doing this)
  Anyway, finally after 15 minutes of looking, I finally checked the line where
it exits the tank. BINGO!!!! Here's what had happened-
I have a manual '67 bus. However, I installed an automatic starter, so as to
avoid the bushing and all that stuff. Well, the automatic starter is about an
inch and a half longer than the original. With all the axles and heater hoses
in the way, I hadn't noticed that the end of the new starter had pinched the
fuel line where it exited the tank. Luckily, this happened safely at home, and
I quickly remedied the situation. I guess I should have figured something was
funny when it happened after I finished doing work on the bus, but I didn't...
Anyway, just a reminder to always check carefully around everything you do,
lest you pinch a fuel line, or wire, or something important.
Safe wrenching to all!!!!!
