Subject: Re: Aux solenoid/hot start fix article

&gt; Good points, all.  I think that the recommendation for the generic Ford
&gt; solenoid is due to the higher throughput amperage than that sustainable by
&gt; the Bosch relays.  In cold weather I would think that the starter could
&gt; pull =&gt; 50 amps.  Will the Bosch relay carry that kind of short term load? 
&gt; Anyone know the max starting amperage of a Vanagon starter? 
&gt; 
Mine was not even a Bosch relay, it was an auxiliary light relay made by
NightBlaster or some such for their fog lights.  Rated to 30 amps.  It's
done well for me, but I must confess I installed it in summer and sold
the bus a week or so ago, so I don't know how it would do in the dead of
winter but it did great down to 20 F or so.  Hoover once told me when I
asked him about this that the draw was around 30 amps.  I think the
Bosch relay is only fused for 15 amps and I haven't heard of anybody
having problems.


&gt; &gt;From an empirical standpoint, I've had the Ford relay in place for several 
&gt; years and the system hasn't hiccuped once.  I would think that if the Ford 
&gt; pulled the same activation current as the starter solenoid that I would 
&gt; have continued to have problems even after the modification.  Not trying 
&gt; to be contrary, just my observations.

&gt;From what I gather, it's not exactly the same; it's less but it's not a
whole darn lot less.  The relay is a whole darn lot less :) .  Perhaps
Bob can give us more specific values to work with because I have no idea
:) .  The Ford solenoid hasn't given me any trouble but I've only had
the thing for a few weeks, we'll see how it holds up.  I jsut don't like
the idea of anything for a Ford on my VW -- Ford does not impress me :)
..

&gt; 
&gt; I think we'll have to see whose solution is best over time.  For now, as
&gt; long as the system's functional I'd leave it in place.  My philosophy is
&gt; if it ain't broke, don't fix it...;)  YMMV, though, of course. 

Yeah, I'd say you're right.  It's too cold to mess with it now anyway :)

Take care and thanks for the response,
Sean
