Subject: Re: Trakka/ Eurovans

Trakka did Syncro conversions too, same swingout 'galley', nice concept.
They also have belly tanks for drinking water, and for shower water heated
by a coolant loop from the engine.  An Oz lister is touring in one right now
and said they'd been drinking green water for a while, thinking it was
algae, then the coolant loop broke wide open and the bright green water came
out of the taps. Turned out the drinking and shower water tanks were
interconnected, gack.  They are self sufficient units with the heater and
solar panels, for endurance outback travel.  The Eurovans are on-road
conversions.  tim smith
