WOW,

 We picked up TWO DIESELS! YES!, and 13 '82s!  I feel like I am
on a winning team. 

 NuBus is back &quot;home&quot; now ('82 diesel with blowed-up engine), and I
have received an estimate for engine replacement. I have located one
with 44k miles SMO (Since major overhaul), and have given my FLAG the
ok to swap 'em. I was gonna do it myself, but at $1K for the engine
and labor, I'll subcontract it out...(Besides, you can't replace an
engine from the back of a USair flight, and I spend my *life* on USair
flights)

 Joel, could you re-publish the &quot;Person-Email_Address-Year-Model&quot; list
that you did once before? The old copy is getting dated, and there has
been a great deal of membership activity lately.

Still the owner of a  '82 diesel
