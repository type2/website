Subject: Question re: engine removal

I am about to pull the 1700 engine from my 73 so I can overhaul it (inside)
over the winter.

Can someone confirm for me that it is NOT necessary to support the
transaxle with the engine pulled?

In the back of Muir,  I think it says that there is a transaxle support
above the back of the transaxle, but I can't see it.
