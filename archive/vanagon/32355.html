Subject: '87 Westy Stalling ?
Date: Tue, 9 Jan 1996 19:22:01 -0500 (EST)

My '87 Westy, has been having this anoying stalling problem for the last
month or so.  Yes, it's the same one that I just posted a note about the
head leaking so maybe there's a relationship.  However, the problem occurs
only whern mild and damp with slush out.  Otherwise at dry, cold
temperatures all is normal.  &quot;Usually&quot; the motor will stall soon after
start up, while driving at low speeds and by turning off the key and
restarting immidiately it restarts with no problem and continues on for
awhile and may stall again, sometimes several times before the symptom
goes away.  It never stalls when at highway speeds nor after having been
driven for a long period.  Seems to occur only during the first 15 to 30
minutes after being started unless taken up to highway speeds immediately.
I can make no sense out of this whatsoever and am hoping for some
collective insight here form you list members.  ?????

Cheers

Frank
