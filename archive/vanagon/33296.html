Subject: Easy Rider blues/Splits in films

I remember in '68 seeing Easy Rider and coming out thinking WOW and far out
and other such adolescent stuff..at least I think I remember it...someone once
said if you remember the sixties you must have had a bum life...
Anyway it was premiered on TV the other week so I video'd it and have just
(tried) to sit through it. Omigod! Crass acting, dreadful script, appalling
stereotypes...mind you the soundtrack was still ace (but if I wanna hear it I
use me CD) and some of the scenery was good, and the bikes were OK..for five
minutes. The only bit I really enjoyed was the sight of the deluxe at the
&quot;hippy&quot; (i hate that word) camp...how times change ....:(
seems I can't watch a movie these days without startling the family by
shouting 'Looka that Splitty!&quot;...and I almost got thrown out of the cinema at
the opening of &quot;Sneakers&quot; (interior of a Split)...do I need a cure for this
weird affliction or is this all that's worth watching on celluloid these
days...oh well...
&quot;My people were fair and wore stars in their hair, now they've grown old and
wear stars on their brow&quot; (bet no-one remembers that one!
PS Cee and I still dream that one day we'll mosey down the blacktop in the
land of surreal sunsets....! :) :) :)          Dave.
