Wendy,

Slick 50 is about as useful as Splitfire sparkplugs which are as useful, 
pardon the expression, as tits on a bull. Don't waste your money. Use the 
best oil you can, change it often, etc...and you should have no problems.

If you feel the urge to spend the extra $$$, send it to me c/o my 
Rebuild-my-56-beetle Fund.

;-)
