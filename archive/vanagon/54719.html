Subject: Re: Seat covers for 86 Bus Plus

Mark,

	I have never heard anyone use the term &quot;bus plus&quot;. Most of the list
refers to it as the &quot;weekender&quot; package. Actually, I like the term bus
plus better, but I usually call mine a Westy because it has the pop-top
(with Westfalia on the front and back). The rest of the interior is just
as you described. Mine also has a rear closet and is a syncro.
	Anyway, I've looked long and hard for seat covers myself to no avail.
One suggestion is to make your own. If you're not in to the sewing
thing, find someone who is. That way you have complete control over
color and material. You might even save some money. Demand for these
seat covers for these models isn't very big and I'm sure it would be a
special order item, if they're even made. Good-luck and post to the list
if you find them retail.
