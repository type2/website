&gt; I think we need a kind of Old Bus Recovery Squad, a group of us foolish
&gt; enough to respond to requests for on-site assistance with regard to
&gt; evaluating the mechanical condition of old buses, providing our skill and
&gt; expertese extracting said from bogs for the purpose of trailering, towing or
&gt; driving (shrill laughter) the wreck to where ever the new owner wishes to
&gt; commit mechanical seppuku.
&gt; 
Just this week, I somewhat foolishly became interested in a bus across
the country. I posted a plea for help, and was answered by James Brill,
a resident of that area. While things didn't work out, I think the
concept would certainly work. I have gone with several folks looking at
buses, and I love to do it. Anything to spread the buses around...
:)
I guess my suggestion is for people just to post where they are, and ask
for help in that area. Most likely, someone will respond.
I know I will.
Richard
