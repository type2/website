Subject: lucky for me a thread on overheating

Well all this talk about overheating could not occur at a better time. Last
night my wife drives home from work in her 71 super beetle (bertha) like
every other week night, except I was home (instead of working on my thesis).
My brother and I were working on the 59 single cab. I noticed a nasty smell
coming from the beetle and my wife said that bertha (the beetle) was running
pretty crappy. So I adjusted the carb and got out the strobe light and
adjusted the timing. I had did a tune up about 1500 miles ago but everything
needed adjustment yesterday.

Anyway heres the deal. This is a stock 73 engine with 34 pict 3 carb and
vacuum advance dist. I checked for vacuum leaks by the &quot;stethascope (sp)
method&quot; and didnt find any. the points, roter, etc. passed inspection. I
timed at 5 ATDC as perscribed by muir at 900 rpm. I let the old girl sit for
a while then started her up and she didnt want to idle on her own, then I
drove her around for a few miles to warm her up then checked the dipstick
(not my brother the one in the car) and it was pretty warm (I could hold it
but with some discomfort)

questions

1) why wont she idle
2) why is she hot

Please this is a serious plea for help

59 update

1) engine is in though we have not attempted to start s/he we need to get a
6 volt battery

2) 70 model gas tank is in

3) seats uppolstered (My brother did some very creative work with coffe bags
an we are going to leave it this way for a while.

4) window and door rubber recieved, still searching for windsheild glass,
should follow a lead tonight.

5) two happy crusty longhaired generation x'ers got a good nights sleep

thanks jason

the only vehicle I didnt mention was the 71 westy...It is just plain fugly
