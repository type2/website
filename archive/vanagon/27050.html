&gt;  &gt; This whole paint ball  idea is a little too intriguing, isn't it?!!?  
&gt;  &gt; I mean its a defensive move that has real possibilites...

&gt; Yes, it's attractive, but what I worry about is that when I draw a bead with 
&gt; the paint gun the target (who's a jerk or I wouldn't be doing this) hauls the 
&gt; .357 out from under his seat and lets me have it.

That's silly. No self-respecting carrier of a firearm would place it that
far out of control. He'll pull his gun out of his holster. It's a bad idea
to haul around firearms and elave them in the car when you aren't there,
and it's annoying to put it under the seat every time you get in the car.

&gt; He'd probably get off, too. After all, I pointed a gun at him...

Having been accosted by police because of paintball guns in the past, I
can attest to their validity as &quot;threatening objects&quot;.

Gotta love &quot;Catch-22&quot; laws like &quot;Disturbing the Peace&quot;. Acquitted.
