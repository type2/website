 It just goes
&gt;&gt; 'whir,whir' as if it had a dead battery (not the case) or was suffering from
&gt;&gt; vapor lock.  Anyone have any ideas?
 Wires were slowly parting, to the
&gt;point where they would work only when the temperature was cool.

What do you mean by whir whir?  Is the bendix engaging the starter? Or is
the starter just spinning without turning over the engine? Those solenoids
can be the source of such things. I don't know if the Vanagons starter
motor is a two part device where you replace the starter and solenoid
separatly or not. More guess than diagnosis, but I thought I chip in
anyway.
