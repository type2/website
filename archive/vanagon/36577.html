Subject:  spring break

Hey all,
I am leaving this afternoon for spring break.  I'm going home, but home is
six hours away in Johnson City, TN so this will be the maiden road trip
for my '78 bus.  Pretty much everything is working except for the turn
signals (I hope I can fix this at home) and the windshield washer.  I won't
need the washer today as it's a beautiful sunny day!  Great day to drive.
Thanks to everybody for all their help so far, it's made my time a lot
easier.  If I figure out this turn signal business I will post my joy to the list
:) .  I will be back the evening of March 10th but may subscribe from my
mom's account at home.  Take care everybody.

Thanks,
Sean
