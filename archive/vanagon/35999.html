Subject: Help with syncro driveshaft?


Hi..
I need some advice regarding u-joints and syncro driveshafts.
Both u-joints in the driveshaft of our 87 syncro went bad,
making it vibrate like crazy.
I got my friendly local mechanic to remove the driveshaft,
leaving me with one of the few 2 wheel drive syncros in
captivity (at least doesn't vibrate anymore). Anyway, he managed
to replace the joints but the vibration is still there. I asked
him to rebalance the shaft and he claims that this is
virtually imposible since &quot;no one&quot; has the yokes required
to grab the shaft and balance it.

My Bentley book says that the u-joints can neither be serviced
nor replaced and that the driveshaft should be replaced as a
whole. Is this the reason?

I remember that someone else recently ran into the same problem,
but can't find the posting.  What does the collective list
wisdom suggest? If the driveshaft does indeed have to be
replaced, does anyone know a source for new or used ones? 
(but then what we'll do in the future after *all* the junkyard
driveshafts have been used?)

TIA for all suggestions
