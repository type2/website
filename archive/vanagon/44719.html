&gt; PS: Do Type II's slide, or roll first? IF roll, which tire lifts first?
How do 
&gt;     you tell? How soon before the second tire lifts, and how do you
tell?;-)


They slide!!  I constantly scare the sh*t out of newbies in the 78 camper.
 The car has some understeer, especially over bumps, but a new sway bar
and shocks should help.  Ive never lifted a wheel in a bus (that I know
of) but my beetle always lifted the inside rear tire, and my brothers gti
really lifts the inside wheel, like 6 inches.
