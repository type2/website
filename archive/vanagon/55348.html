&gt; &gt;   Any advice much appreciated.  My head gaskets are leaking after an
&gt; &gt; overheat.  It's an '87 with 68K miles on it.  Should I kick down and do the
&gt; &gt; heads at the same time? The mechanic thinks it's almost always necessary.
&gt; &gt;  I've heard the contrary.

It is my understanding that VW heads are extermely difficult to shave even
by the best machine shops.  The Parts Place has an excellent description
of why this is so.  Please check before you have a shop shave down your
heads.  You may be sorry if you have this head job to do twice.
