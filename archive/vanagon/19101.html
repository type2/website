Subject:      77 comparison

thank you for all the help
the results from my price comparison request is
(remember 77 champagne edition 7 passenger in mint shape; $6500)
5 votes to expensive and should generally half the asking price
1 vote, i wish it were near me so i could buy it
1 vote, it is what it is and its worth what youll pay.

i have to agree with the latter
however with further consultation with my wife
i will be passing up this offer
thanks for the help drew.
all smiles :)))))))))))))

p.s. A PEDIGREE REFFERED TO REPAIR HISTORY WITH RECEIPTS!!!
P.P.S. i will be signing off for the weekend to avoid excessive mail
build up.  off to highgate...eeehaaaaa.
