Subject: Phoenix events??

All,

I will be passing thru Arizona this weekend in my new Vdub and would like to
catch any events in the area.  The magazines list an event in Phoenix the
weekend of April 13-14.  Someone told me there was a show this weekend.  Does
anyone know anything about it??  Anyone on here from the Arizona bus club?

Please Email direct.  ThatVWGuy_at_AOL_dot_com
