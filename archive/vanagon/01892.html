Subject: Re:  need hints to remove rear 73 drums

pull the two 10 mm bolts and bang the hell out of them with either a rubber
malley or (better) a 2 lb steel hammer with a piece of sacrificial 
lumber (2X4 works well) in between. 

If you can, back off the adjusters as far as possible (my guess is if the
drums are stuck so are the adjusters, however   :-(
