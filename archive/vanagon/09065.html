&gt;Hi, I'm new to the list. I desperately need a shop manual for my 1985
&gt;Wesfalia. I haven't bee able to find one anywhere. Who publishes one?

OWNERS MANUALS
   Volkswagen Product Service Publications    (800) 544-8021
   c/o Dyment Distribution Services           (216) 572-0725 8am-9pm EST
   P.O. Box 360740                            visa/mc accepted
   Strongsville, OH 44136

   order #     description                          price
   VOM CA-xxxx Camper (supplement to Vanagon) ..... $7.50
   VOM VA-xxxx Vanagon ............................ $7.50
          where xxxx is the year you want (1981, 1989, etc.)
   free index/catalog is order # VI
   free subscription to service bulletins (currently being issued) is
     order # VBS 88 (but you have to renew each year, and they don't
     tell you that it has stopped).

also check with the dealer parts dept ... some folks have gotten them there
for about $5!! &lt;obviously, a mistake!!! :) &gt;

and i've seen these guys advertise, but have no experience with them:
