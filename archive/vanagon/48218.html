Subject: Re: Carpet or Something else? (correction)

&gt;&gt;i just modified the interior of my 72 westy a bit--i moved the
&gt;&gt;sink/icebox unit to the right side.  the icebox now opens toward the
&gt;
&gt;um, make that the _left_ side.  thats always a tough distinction for me.


Yup, makes the fridge reachable from up front while driving.  But hey, why
didn't you put the rear facing seat where the fridge was, by the slider?
Works well, van seems bigger in back and easier to get into, and the seat
comes out with only 4 screws.  I just fastened mine down with fat sheet
metal screws through wooden floor and into metal floor.   Great for big
loads.  I carpeted the whole back after moving fridge, but before seat, so
with seat out it still looks 'finished'.  tim smith
