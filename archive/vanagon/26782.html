Subject: Re: Winnebago Rialta


I just want to address a comment that was made about the Rialta and
the &quot;demise&quot; of the Westfalia....

The Rialta is a US/Canada model only. The T4 &quot;Westy&quot; is alive
and well in Europe in a wide range of models...from the
&quot;Weekend&quot; package we had here back in 1993...to the poptop
full camper model, to an extended chasis, raised roof version
called the &quot;California&quot;.... unfortunately, we only get
the stripped Weekender and the Winnebago variations here.

As to the LT versions of the Westy...those have been available
for a long time now...almost as long as the LT has been in
existance (late 70s?)
