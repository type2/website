Subject:      Weakly Stats ...

well, i'm sending it out early tonight ... cause my alternator died
on me as i was turning into my driveway. :(  something had been making
sickly noises, somewhat akin to fan-belt-driven devices of some sort,
back in Ye Olde Engine-Land ... i wasn't sure if it was an alternator
bearing (cause of the &quot;howling&quot; aspects of the noise; and cause nothing
seemed amiss electrically) or the power steering pump. well, before i
shut it off, there were sparks (metal-to-metal kind) coming out of the
alternator, so i'm pret-ty sure that's the culprit!

that's the good news. :(  the bad news is:
(1) auto electric shops in this fleabag town can't even spell Bosch.
(2) the ONE possible alternator in stock at the FLAPS might not be the
    right one.
(3) all other possibilities are 60 miles away.

it's gonna be a fun day, i'm sure. $160-$270, depending on where i can
get it. :(

anyhoo, here's the Weakly Stats: for all you Unknowns (i.e., Newbies
to the list since last Friday, who haven't told me what bus you are
driving/wanting/pushing/pulling/watching-rust/etc), this is what
i &quot;do&quot; with the info requested in Gerry's welcome letter.
