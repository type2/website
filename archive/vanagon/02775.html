Subject:  79 bus

i am new to the air cooled world (have a 82 scirocco, it has been a 
very mixed reltationship) i plan on buying a bus.  so the other day 
i drove a 79 at it drove great, had plenty of power.  my only 
concerns were two: one that there was a smell, the engine, when the 
heater was turned on, two there was a slight ( a few drops) amount 
of oil leaking from were i presume the two heads are.  how serious 
are these two things?
