&gt;&gt; I had some fun this morning trying to rig my Polaris pool pump so
&gt;&gt; that it would help pump out the water from my sump.  After getting
&gt;&gt; everything hooked up right, I couldn't figure out a way to prime 
&gt;&gt; the pump which the Polaris must have. :(  I'm waiting for the traffic 
&gt;&gt; jams to dissapate before I go get a new pump.
&gt;
&gt;Don't you have a spare Type I engine you can rig to a pump?
&gt;Hang in there!
&gt;

See, this is an excuse to get an old Fire Engine Bus!  They came with w
36hp pump, that could be carried to the scene of the fire.  I came with
draft (draught, for you english kaniggits) from a water source!!
