Subject: Re: Thinking of Buying '84 Westy - Still

Thanks to all who have answered our many questions on the '84 Westy. 
 We're still not sure whether we're going to buy it or not (still 
need the compression test done), but we're now comfortable about 
what we need to know to decide!

If this one doesn't pan out, we are now hopelessly bitten by the 
camper bug!  We were driving in front of a friend, and a white 
Westy pulled alongside us.  Now our friend is teasing us for 
visibly drooling at the Westy! So - if anyone knows of any in the 
Washington DC - Virginia - Maryland area for sale. . . . ;^)

Cheers,

Debbie &amp; Howard Fleming
