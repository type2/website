hi,

&gt;       Is anybody going to the Bug Jam this weekend. I will be 
&gt;

I'll be there friday evening sometime. Not in my Van though as its not quite 
ready. (suffering from post lowering/smoothing etc). Watch out on saturdays'
RWYB for a peach/orange '66 1200 trying to break 60mph ET barrier down the 
strip. Previous bests are 58 &amp; 59.5mph!

Praying for a easterly gale....



Stuart,
