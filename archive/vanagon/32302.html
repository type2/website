Actually, the warranty has been gone awhile, but we did just finish paying
for it...
The same thing happened to my 90 GL, except mine went away from the drivers 
side....took mine apart to see the same guide hanging in peices....

I was able to get the window back up, and eventually I shall remove the 
support the gudie rests in, and epoxy (or something like that....) the guide 
back on to the regulator/support.  This WILL involve removing the 
support/regulator/whatever thingie, since the epoxy/whatever work will take 
place on the back/hidden side of the thingie in question.....Bentley 
procedure looks &quot;challenging....&quot;

Failing the eopxy cure, Looks like replacement....junkyard would be my 
suggester...

'90 Vanagon GL.

The passenger-side power-window thingy died with the window about two
inches from the top.  I was blocks from the dealer so I pulled in and took
the liner off of the door.  They had a window regulator in stock ($161US)
and I looked at it to see if I could tell what had happened.  The little
plastic wire-guide that goes at the bottom of the sliding-guide-thing had
fallen off.  I have all of the pieces and none are broken.
