Subject: Newbie WANTS an H2O Westfalia

I'm new to this list. I'm looking for a water cooled Westfalia on the
west coast. I live in Washington (Seattle area) but I am frequently in
the Bay area and will make trips into Oregon or towards LA in the next
few weeks. I would prefer Manual and any color but Gold (Bordeux is my
favorite).

I'm new to the watercooled generation and still trying to find out what
to look for and what to stay away from, so if anyone has too much
information and nowhere to put it, I'd love to hear it. FYI Most of my
experience with Volkswagens is cosmetic. I restored a `60 Westfalia from
the ground up about 7 years ago.

Thanks
Eric
