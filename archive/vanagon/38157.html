Subject: Rebushing carb throttle shafts
Date: Fri, 22 Mar 1996 09:24:20 -0600 (CST)

Also from Hot Rod:

Carburetor throttle shaft rebushing kits.  They list for Quadra-Jet 
and Holley for about $35 and then a 100 piece kit that has 10 sizes 
for $100.  If you knew exactly what size you needed you might be 
able to rebuild that unidling Solex for $35.
