Subject: More on GNATT and Busses by the Arch
Date: Tue, 7 Feb 1995 12:16:01 -0600 (CST)

Hi everyone,

Just got off the phone with Bill Baumann (?), the organizer of the
bi-annual Busses by the Arch event. He sounded very excited about the
prospect of having a *caravan* of out-of-state type 2s attend the event.
Unfortunately, BBTA will take place on Memorial Day weekend, May 26-28,
which is almost 2 weeks before our scheduled arrival in St.Louis (June
12th). What are the chances that we change our plans accordingly? 

Even if we do not get there on time, though, Bill thinks that we could
still meet up with local people. Some would probably be happy to offer
their backyards for camping. 

BBTA takes place at Zumwalt Park in O'Fallon, MO. It's heavily wooded and
covered with grass, not dirt. Last time, in September, 84 type 2s, mainly
busses, showed up. The main feature is the 90 mile sightseeing (and be
seen) drive through Illinois's prettier part. An award ceremony takes
place in the evening for best this and furthest that. There is a $20
charge per vehicle, that covers all organizational and rental expenses.

On getting the word out about GNATT: Bill suggested that we announce the
event in Hot VW, although the 3-month deadline may already be past. Of
course, we should also inform the chapters of LiMBO and NEATO.
