Subject: '89 Vanagon oil warning light


Hello everyone!                                                                 

I am getting an intermittant oil warning light coming on. However, there        
doesn't seem to be an oil pressure problem as my mechanic said &quot;if there        
was a problem, the light and buzzer would stay on&quot;                              

Any ideas or comments.
