&gt;It starts out with 2 lanes, then, unbelievaby, wides to 3 lanes.
&gt;When the next lane opens up on the right, I try desperately to get into,
&gt;doing about 40-45.  Nuh-un.  Mr Sport-Ute Nissan Pathfinder Badass slides
&gt;in, followed in kind by several of his similarly mounted brethren.
&gt;The freakin' LEFT lane was OPEN!

i've got one for you: similar situation (2 lanes, then 3 &lt;truck-lane opens
up on right, going UP hill.) ... as soon as i get into the truck lane, i
try to come over to the right, but NOOOOOOOOO .... little miss dufus has
decided that my bumper doesn't smell good anymore, so she's off around me
on the right.

well, that just frosted the cake for mr following-behind-her! he goes out
around on the left, into the on-coming DOWNhill lane, across a double-yellow
line, and passes both of us, making it three abreast for a few seconds.

have people just gone nutso or what? are they not taught the meanings of
truck-lanes and yellow lines anymore?? or is everybody just too damned greedy
and in too much of a hurry to even consider &quot;waiting their turn&quot; and being
a little bit courteous??

in the last 15 years in this town, the rule of thumb has become:
&quot;when you go through a GREEN light, look both ways first!&quot;

it's really amazing the stupid things people do. and i'm glad i have a car
that isn't fast enough to let me do most of those things. :)
