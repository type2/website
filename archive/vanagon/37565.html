&gt; Next portion:  GEX is a good company.  My last engine died on the 
&gt; freeway(it was about 10 mo. old from GEX--maybe 15K).  Had the van towed to 
&gt; Small Car Performance in Tacoma.  Don the shop guy called GEX and 
&gt; they talked about things unbeknownst to me.  End result:  GEX fired 
&gt; me off a fresh engine (same as the old one--2.0L), and are paying for 
&gt; 1/2 the labor and all parts.

I'm glad GEX replaced your motor, but does that make them a good
company?  Their engine did fail after 10 months, right?  I'd rather do
business with a company that offers no warranty but who's motors last a
long time.  :)
