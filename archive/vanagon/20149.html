Subject: Re: Blown Coolant Hoses

&gt;I  haven't had the problems you have had however I have noticed one thing
&gt;with my 87' Syncro.  There are a lot of hoses which i have found to be
&gt;chafing against brackets, and other things within the engine compartment.  At
&gt;Mike 87' Syncro
&gt;
Anyone had any of the metal piping bits go yet? Mine look pretty badly 
pocked, especially the big double unit over the engine nearest the trans. I 
am afraid to take it of and sandblast it, I think the rust is all that's 
holding it together.  tim s. ('87 syncro)
