&gt;seal off coolant from leaking to outside of engine. I can't see why these

the parts don't cost that much ... that has to be parts and labor for the
job at a dealer. a local guy did his own 84 bus and all his parts came to
only about $240 (not from the dealer, though).

&gt;I am also considering to tighten all head bolts to see if it can cure it.
&gt;Is this a good idea?

it's probably too late for that. just pray you don't have metal eroded away
on the heads ... cause then you'll have to replace them and they are very
expensive. :(
