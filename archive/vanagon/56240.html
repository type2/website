Subject: Re: lowest mileage

Really had to respond to this one!

My '91 Westy Greta - who I lost to an engine fire - was purchased 3/30/95 with
10,600 one-owner miles on her. She had been owned by a German stockbroker who
collected nice cars. She took me on camping trips to Canada in the summer of
'95 and 7 weeks west to 13 National Parks and many other wild lands in the
summer of '96. When she 'died' this past Nov 15th she had only experienced
25,065 miles. It does break my heart to think of all the places she missed out
on!

I am in the process of buying another '91 Westy (currently nameless) who has
been owned by an older couple as their third Westy. This one has 28,500 miles
on her, but I know she has made several trips to Montana to visit family.

I hope to keep her miles low but quality - that is she, nor none of her pre-
dicessors, will not be my daily driver. She is purely for pleasure and quality
time on the back roads and scenic byways. She will be driven for antiquing,
photography adventures, and camping trips. And when she leaves me - I will try
to insure that she goes home with another who truly cares about her welfare
as much as I do. For Westies deserve the very best of care.
