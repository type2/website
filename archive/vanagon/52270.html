Subject: 87 Vanagon FS or Part-out? Weekender

  Listees,

  I'm offering a Vanagon to you all to see if it gets sold in ONE piece, or
Parted-out?

  This is a Weekender, I think you call it, rear Jump seats with folding out
table.

  The engine is blown, Head-gaskets at least.   .
  Steering rack is leaky, 
  Bad rear tires
  No Rear Bumper
  Minimal body damage
  Cracked tailight lens
  Bad hatch struts

  There is only ONE of the rear facing Jump seats(The left side one).  Auto
trans.  Alloy Wheels.

  Please respond to my Volks-motorsports E-mail address!!!

  I'm going to put together a list of people that want parts, and I'm going
to put together a list of the people that might want it Whole!

  I'd Rather sell it whole!  e-mail me and let's see what happens!

  Kyle
