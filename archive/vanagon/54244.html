Subject: Joel, change the stats (sniff!)

Well, I've been in and out of contact with the list for a few months 
(that last semester in school can be a real time-suck!), but now I'm 
back and I feel it's my duty to report this stat change.

I've moved, for one thing. Count me among the Californians, now. San 
Jose, to be precise. And (and this is the hard part)--I have become a 
wannabus. Mabel and I had to part ways (yes, amicably) when I moved, 
mainly because I didn't have the fundage to get her here with me and 
my other car, but also because she and the CA emissions test/ 
inspection would _not_ have gotten along. I decided that even if I 
could scrape up the cash to get her here, I'd have a hard and 
expensive time getting her to pass.

So. If anyone happens upon a pristine (hey, just because I'm not in 
school doesn't mean I have time now:)) '71 pop-top Westy in the Bay 
Area, I'd sure love to hear about it...
