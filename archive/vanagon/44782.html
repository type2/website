Subject: RE: WTB CV Joint and fr. wheel bearings.


&gt;So my question is: Do these symptoms sound like a CV joint?

Absolutely.


&gt;Also, Bow Wow wants $80 for the CV and $10.50 for each front wheel
bearing,

JC Whitney (312-431-6102) has the CVs for $59.95 each, and the front
bearings for $6.49 (inner) and $5.95 (outer). But their shipping is kinda
high.

If I were you, I'd call around to many different aftermarket VW places
and import parts stores in the Seattle area. You'd be surprised how much
prices vary for the same identical item. And use a good molybdenum grease
on the CV before you install it, with a new boot.

R&amp;R isn't too hard-- I did mine on my old '69 bus in Colorado many years
ago. Get a good Allen wrench for the bolts that hold it on-- I broke my
ElCheapo, then got a Craftsman from Sears and had no further problems.
Take out all the Allen bolts on BOTH CVs on the same half-axle, and the
half-axle will literally fall off the car, complete with CVs. I remember
this well, because my chin was directly below it at the time, and those
CVs are heavy.   :-$

You don't have to replace all CVs at the same time like brake shoes--
just the bad one, if you can tell which one it is. I drove mine till
it failed, so that wasn't hard-- put it in gear, let out the clutch,
and I heard a loud rattle from back there and the bus went nowhere.
Get out and look underneath, you'll find one axle is turning while the
other isn't. Look at the turning axle, and one of the CVs will be turning
with it while the other isn't. The CV that's not turning with its axle,
is the dead one.

Or, if neither axle is turning, look more closely at either side of the
transmission where the axles connect to it. One side will be turning--
that's the bad one.

If you want to replace the CV before it actually fails (the intelligent
course of action, or so I've heard from others)... anyone know how to
spot which CV is getting loose? The torn boot is the most obvious clue,
of course. But if more than one boot is torn... this is a good time
to replace ALL boots, torn or not, since you're already under the car
with the right tools.

Hope this helps...
