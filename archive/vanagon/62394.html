&gt;would appreciate advice on differing brands, platinum vs. non (those that
&gt;advocate &quot;splitfires&quot; need not apply). My (original) air-cooled engine has
&gt;about 82K, runs about 120 PSI across; runs 30-40 weight straight viscosity
&gt;oil in summer. The van is used for some minor (3-5) mile trips during the
&gt;week, and can see 300-500 mile trips in 80*F ambient temps routinely during
&gt;the dog-days of summer. So some healthy spark plug advice would be nice.

Back when I was driving aircooled I found that Germany cars liked German
plugs. I have carried this education thru the years with all the cars I
have owned.
