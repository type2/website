Subject: Re: Vanagon Front Swivel Seat

&gt;I just removed the front passenger seat &quot;swiveler&quot; (for want of a better term)
&gt;from the '84 vanagon located in a junkyard in Rockville, Md. (Tim Smith -
&gt;tranny is still in the van, along with what's left of the engine) I will try to
&gt;get the swiveler under the passenger seat in my '87 van, which came without the
&gt;swivel seats, and report the results to the list. It looks like an easy
&gt;conversion but I've been wrong about such things before.

I think you are going to be wrong about this one, sorry, i tried the same
thing, i tried taking the swiveler out of a 83 (or so) westy and putting it
into my 85 GL (non-westy) and vw or westphalia seems to have welded a
mounting plate between the &quot;tracks&quot; for the swiveler to mount on, i thought
about modifying my setup but it was too much effort/im too lazy.  i was
lucky, the junkyard gave me credit and allowed me to return it, a friend and
i then bought a sofa/bed, and two swivel seats for a 78 dodge van.

seeing as you have a camper, maybe, good luck anyhow..
