Subject: Re: The Muir solenoid trick


I thought it was a ford.gm starter solenoid, not a bosch fog light relay! 
I've been running mine for about 7 months with no problems. The soleniod 
is an EXTREMELY common part everywhere; you should be able to get it at 
K-mart. (This assumes you're air-cooled; I don't know nothing' bout no 
wassercooled engin's.)
