Subject: RE: Porsche 914 List?

Send subscription request to &quot;porschephiles-request_at_tta_dot_com&quot;.  Request will
be read by human being; does not need to be formatted rigidly.  Volume of
that list is roughly equal to vanagon list, maybe bigger, so get your mail-
box ready.  And you'll find that those Porsche enthusiasts hate nothing
about the 914 except rust.
See you around both lists!
B.
