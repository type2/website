Subject: Re: Caravan vs. Vanagon

Confession:
    I have both.
Discussion:
   I bought a Plymouth Voyager because my old '72 bus somehow strangled
itself on the way up to Reno three years back.  I had to get the family 
back to civilization, so I traded it in on a V6 (3.3L) Plymouth Voyager
(aka Caravan).  Yes, it has *NICE* power, but it's too small for our
three kids (all now have long legs) and our camping gear.  I *NEED*
the entire roof-rack area whenever we go anywhere for more than a
day.
   So, now that I can sell the Voyager for as much as I owe on it
(after paying for three years), I bought a replacement:
       1986 Vanagon GL (2.1L, 96 hp)
   I haven't taken it on a trip yet, but it seems to go where I point
it.  It's geared very low 3500 rpm in 4th gear at 64 mph), but that's
fast enough for me.
   The Vanagon seems *EASIER* to drive for me, but then I'm used
to sitting on front wheels.  It's almost 9&quot; taller than the Voyager, and
like Steve suggests, the Vanagon could swallow the Voyager whole.
   Voyagers have other problems by the way.  They're known to 
*EAT FRONT TIRES* and many have transaxle problems at about
60k miles.
   I'm taking my Plymouth Voyager in for a checkup (50k miles), and
they'll fix the rear door latch free (class action lawsuits work).   Then
it's for sale, but I don't expect anybody here would want to buy it!
