rnic&gt; &gt; Texas is big. I mean really big. I mean so vast that you can
rnic&gt; drive for &gt; hours and still be there(apologies to Douglas Adams). 
rnic&gt; 
rnic&gt; You think Texas is BIG...well, you should keep coming north and
rnic&gt; take-in Quebec and/or Ontario...now that's BIG.

     Does BC, Yukon or NWT count?   ;-)  Northward HO!!! (but west first...)
Peace,
Eddie
