Subject: Bought the '87 &amp; Colorado shows

All,

Thanks to all those who answered my RFI's on the '87.  I just got off the
phone with the mechanic and he said everything checked out just fine so I'm
going to go buy it tonight. Soooo, add a '87 GL w/weekender package to the
stats!!!

Is anyone going to the either the Colorado Springs or Denver shows on Aug
10th &amp; 11th??  If so I'll see you there in my new Vanagon!!  (Medium blue
metallic w/Alloys)  Anybody want to camp together and talk VW's???????

Please reply direct - ThatVWGuy_at_AOL_dot_com

Thanks again,
Dan
