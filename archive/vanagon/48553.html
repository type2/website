Subject: vanagon antenna plug adapter?

Thanks to those who told me how to get the radio out.  I found four old 
coat hangers in the cabinet in the back, and they worked just fine.

So now that I can get the radio out, where can I get an adapter so that I 
can plug the VW antenna into my other radio?  There was a post about this 
a couple of weeks ago I think.  

Also, does VW or anyone else sell plugs that I can hook up to the 
speaker and power wires of my other radio which will mate with the ones 
left once I pull out the VW radio?  I can always improvise, but it would 
be nice to be neat for a change.

Thanks for the help.

david
