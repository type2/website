Subject: F.S. '85 Westy Wkndr. Wolfsbg. poptop Camper

Hey, folks,  I'm going to look at this one now,  I'll let you  know about it
when I get back. It's the Westy model without sink/stove, but it does have A/C
and a very large fridge (bigger than the full camper model, which won't even
hold two 2 liter bottles of soda)  It has 94k mi, and is a 4 spd. No rust and
new exhaust. He wants around the 4500 to 4900 price range, or best offer.

This would be good for someone who wants a camper, but also needs space inside
the van for carrying stuff. you can unbolt the jumpseat and fridge and slide a 7
pass vanagon middle seat into there and make it a &quot; 7 passenger Westy&quot;.  Great
model if you have a bunch of rug-rats.

stay tuned............

&quot;I'll Be Back&quot;
