Subject: fantastic '80 camper FS near SF


Listies:

For the first time I have just personally seen Bradley's '80 camper
he has for sale for $700.  Volks, this is a STEAL.  If I didn't already
have an '81 westy, I'd jump at this.  It's in wonderful condition     
considering it's age, and many of it's features were far better than
I had expected.  It would be a crime to let this bus be hacked up!

I believe that Bradley plans to part it out if no one has purchased it
by this coming Tuesday, when I undestand he plans on stripping the
interior and dumping it.  The van would not take much work in or out
to put it in very nice condition.  If I didn't already have 3 VWs, I'd
consider taking on the project myself.

Snoozers lose.  The early bird catches the worm.  Come and get it.
