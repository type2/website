This reminds me.  The shop manual for my BN-4 (early '70s) says that
the heater mounts in the ``forward luggage area''.  Since this is an
Nth generation photocopy, the photograph of the installed unit is
completely undecipherable.  Now, most of my experience is with
microbusi, but I've been in a 1971 a few times.  What, precisely, is
the ``forward luggage area''?

Thanks.
