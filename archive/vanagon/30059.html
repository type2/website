It varies from state to state.  However, the general rule seems to be
that when a vehicle becomes twenty-five years old, it can be
registered as `classic', `vintage', or `collector'.  The common
significance of this is that you get a different style of license
plate.

The varying qualities of such a designation may include lowered (or
no) emissions standards, different registration fees (may be higher or
lower), changed insurance rates, etc.

For instance, in the state of Colorado, what it used to mean (circa
five years ago) was no emissions check and slightly reduced
registration fees, paid five years at a time.  Now, it means the same
fees and time period, but you must pass an emissions test.  The test
is based on the standards for the year the vehicle was made (which is
the same rule as for vehicles with normal plates).

The reason for the five year clause is to discourage those with old
cars that produce huge amounts of pollution from getting around the
clean air act.  The theory is that the people with cars that old that
pollute lots won't be able to afford to pay five years' worth of
registration fee at one time.

So, what's the advantage of collector's plates in Colorado these days?
To the best of my knowledge, it's only not having to deal with
registration every year.

Interestingly enough, vehicles manufactured in 1958 and before have no
emissions test requirements, apparently because there were no
standards in place at the time.  What's even more interesting is that
they base the requirement on what year the total vehicle was made, not
what year engine might be in it.  Admittedly, VWs seem more likely
than other brands to have newer engines in them, but still....

This is a data point, if nothing else.
