Subject: Re: Syncro/Vanagon Stiff Shifting

For those who care...

I guess this applies to all vanagons. 

Spent a morning under the bus replacing every plastic component in the shift 
linkage. 2 slide mount balls, one U-joint, 2 bushes. Cleaned everything else 
up well then loaded moly-EP grease all over. Putting it all back together I 
tried for as much passenger side bias in the shift rod position as possible. 
This made sure that when I pulled the knob towards my side (1st/rev) it 
pushed the selector well into the transmission. 
        It all works now! New grease lightens up the feel of the stick and I 
can reach all gears without effort. Worth being covered in moly slime for 
the morning. Tenacious stuff. I hope this survives a few good rain storms 
however. White grease (in a spray) I used a couple of months back was 
basically gone, no trace!? It had worked for a couple of weeks. Maybe CV 
joint grease is better?
        Only components that seemed worn were one hole in one of the metal 
halves of the U-joint connector, it's still in there since it was $$ to 
replace, plus more days wait. The ball/socket joint right next to the trans 
weren't changed either. They are $$$. 
        As a quick fix for balky shifting I would try dissassembling all the 
linkage form under the stick back. Clean/degrease thoroughly then regrease 
and reinstall. This will tell you if you really need new bits. My U-joint 
connector was frozen almost solid, had to go. For around $20 you can replace 
all the plastic bits, well worth it IMHO. tim s.
