Audi
not just any car will do there is a particular make of automobile that
inspires your fantasies. you can just imagine running your hands across
her, buffing her finish,sliding inside and pressing on the gas pedal,
making the engine rev. indulge in your audi fantasies with other audi
philes and discuss maintenance procedures, parts sources, personal
experiences, and the latest audi news... 

This is as is from &quot; The internet &quot; yellow pages osbournes 2nd edition. I
havn't used the site but it may be worth checking out.
