Subject: Re: Empi/Okrasa stuff......what's it worth?

     You don't hear people asking &quot;how much for that Mona Lisa painting 
     mate ?&quot;. I think , judging by the prices people will pay in the UK 
     that the stuff you've got is worth &quot;a bit&quot; more that a tune up or 
     junked carb.
     
     I know a guy who imports stuff to England, you might want to give him
     a call,
     
     His name is Jon Abbot and his phone is +44 21 554 7963.
