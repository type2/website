Subject:      Newbie ISO Eurovan opinion

Hello all,
Currrently, my wife and I are almost ready to purchase a Eurovan from a
local dealership in Ann Arbor Michigan.  Here is the description:

1993 (of course) Eurovan MV 5 speed
17,800 miles
Loaded, $12,500
One owner, van is painted to match the Mobile home it was dollied behind

I would like to get anyone's personal opinion or experience with the
Eurovan.  To date I am on my 5th VW car (Type 3, Scirocco, Jetta Diesel,
Jetta GLI, Passat GLX), and I'm convinced there are no other cars that
compare (except maybe my 914).  Our family is expanding and we need a
bigger vehicle.

I am interested in any news I can get from the people on this list, as I
have no experience with the Audi 5 cylinder / Eurovan whatsoever.

TIA
