Subject: Re: Tan paste on inside of oil cap

&gt; I own a 81 Westy and was wondering if anyone knows the reason for the tan
&gt; paste that forms on the inside of my oil cap.  It seems to me I read
&gt; something bad about this years ago in Consumer Reports, in an article on how

OK after the last extended discussion which admittedly I did not pay 
good attention too I've been waiting for someone to bring this back 
up, sure we know its emusified oil/water, but why exactly is it there 
and more prevalent on the FI vehicles.  Answer is obvious to me, and 
running at warmer temperatures/longer stretches is a band aid not a 
solution.  I may be an idiot on this one too, but why did they get 
rid of the crankcase breather intakes with FI.  I mean the thing has 
the oultet back into the damn air intake, but how is water ever going 
to get out of the system once in without a filtered air intake, does 
the FI car have one? I don't know where if it does, somebody 
enlighten me, all in all it seems to me that it lacks a complete 
breather system like the carbed vehicles had.
