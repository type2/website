Subject: A/C Freon replacement update

Hi Everyone.  I was just catching up on some of my reading, and in 
the December/95 issue of European Car there was the following article 
on a new refrigerant for older CFC-12 systems.  The article is as 
follows;

OZ Technology, Inc, is nearing complete certification on HC-12a, an 
environmentally friendly hydrocarbon refrigerant blend developed to 
be an effective replacement for HFC-134a, and all other substitutes 
for CFC-12.  HC-12a is a direct drop-in replacement and requires no 
retrofitting or redesigning of the refrigeration system.  For 
distributor information contact:  OZ Technology, Inc., E. 6552 
Seltice Way, Post Falls, ID, 83854, ph: 208-664-6196.

Anybody on the list near this place to check it out???

Remaining hopeful...
Harry.
