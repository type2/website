&gt;In response to all the replies I received yesterday in regards to the 
&gt;cargo floor sections in my '66 MicroBus..

&gt;I did some more investigating on the Bus this morning.. it looks like it 
&gt;would be wise to replace the two floor halves, front crossmembers, and 
&gt;rocker panels.

&gt;Is this major work for a welder to do properly?  I know in a Bug it can 
&gt;be a pain in the ass to replace rockers and floors, but I have never done 
&gt;this on a Bus.

&gt;We have several VW Shoppes here in the Twin Cities area.  Should I &gt;use one
of these to have it done or take it to a welding specialist?

When redoing the cargo floor and rocker on my 65 bus, I bought the parts from
Mill Supply Inc. in Cleveland OH (phone 216-241-5072).  I suspect that these
are the same repair panels that everyone else has, though the quality has
been better than some I've bought and seen from elsewhere.
IMHO, the difference between the $25 floor panels and the $225 floor panels
is some hand work around the bottom latch.  The corrugations in the $25
pieces are a perfect match to the original floor.

At least on my 65 bus, there is a third part to the rocker panel assembly: a
sort of z-shaped panel that makes the rocker into two triangular
cross-section members (real stiff).  Absolutely no one that I talked to about
the inside part knew anything about it.  Maybe, it rusted into oblivion
before the rocker was replaced?  Absolutely no one had a replacement part for
it.  I had a local sheet metal shop bend a replacement &quot;Z&quot; for me out of 18
gauge steel.  He used a scrap of the original panel as a pattern.  I had to
spot weld some of the pieces together in reinstalling the rocker (yes, I
bought a spot welder).  I found the most time consuming part was matching the
seam marks at the ends of the rocker panel (a die grinder helped). 

An amateur (like me) can do the work if you take your time and think through
every step.  Anyone who has replaced a front floor of a bus can certainly do
the cargo floor.   Be careful when replacing structural members (like rockers
and outriggers).  Try to support everything  in the position and alignment
you want , before,  and during the r and r.  Cargo floors tend to sag a
little with time, so you may want to &quot;preload&quot; things just a little.
 Amateurs can make strong weld sooner than they can make pretty welds.
 Fortunately, the floor and rockers are mostly out of sight, so go to it if
that is your idea of fun.

The best suggestion for finding a shop to do your work for you would be to
find someone who is delighted with the results of a similar job, and have the
same person do yours.
