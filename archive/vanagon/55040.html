Subject: Re: RE&gt;Re: FWD&gt;Help!!! Broken down on a dirt road in Costa Rica!

Kirk,

Thanks for writing back.  I'm glad that your experience with this shop=20
has been so good, in fact, I have never heard of such excellent treatment=
=20
by an auto repair shop.  Talk about contrasting opinions!

Unfortunatly, what I spoke of really happened.  I saw the ad, drove to=20
the shop, told Roger what I was hearing and recieved the &quot;need a new=20
engine&quot; verdict when I returned.  The van was new to me, I had never=20
owned a VW before and was not very knowledgable about the internal=20
workings of its engine.  I wouldn't be surprised if my ignorance was=20
fairly obvious at the time.  Roger said it could be several things=20
including possibly valves, but a valve job alone was not offered as an=20
option.  He said that whatever the problem was it was internal and that=20
the engine needed to be pulled and disassembled, and that since it was=20
relatively high milege (115K at the time) it would be better to have it=20
rebuilt or replaced (which, if I really thought the engine needed to be=20
removed, I would agree with).

Obviously no one wants to hear that they need a new engine from anybody,=20
regardless, I needed to think it over and told him this.  He called a=20
couple of times to set up an appointment which I kept putting-off.  I=20
then had the vehicle checked out by 2 other reputable shops (including my=
=20
current one, Freds), both of whom concurred precisely, that it was a=20
valve lifter which sticks occasionally.  They both said that as long as=20
this tapping goes away by the time the engine reaches operating temp it=20
is only a noise if one can learn to live with it.  In fact, they both=20
suggested frequent oil changes to loosen up the lifter, advice which I have=
=20
followed and that has=20
resulted in this noise becoming more and more infrequent.  I have since=20
further confirmed this analogy in several books and posts on this list=20
and info in web sites.  Further, both shops agreed if I really couldn't=20
live with it, or if the sound started to not go away, that a valve job=20
would cure it completely, $5-700.  Apparently, this is a frequent problem=
=20
with Vanagons, I would be interested in hearing from other listees who=20
have experienced this syndrome.

Certainly the situation was subjective, I complained of a noise and Roger=
=20
suggested a route which would get rid of it, and he's right, a new engine=
=20
would get rid of the noise.  I did not disbelieve him at the time, it was=
=20
only after I did extensive research on the subject that I formed a solid=20
opinion.  Who knows, perhaps my engine will totally fail as he predicted,=
=20
it just hasn't happened yet in over 35K since my visit to this shop. =20
Since, I=20
have had major tuneups/inspections every 10K which include checking all=20
systems and a=20
compression check.  The van recieves a clean bill of health each time.

Coincidentally, it was very close to 2 years ago that this happened, it=20
is interesting that my experience apparently occurred very close to, or at=
=20
the same time as Roger was selling the shop.  I think of the reasons for=20
which one might sell one's livelihood, and money problems comes to mind.

Regardless, to set the record straight, while its true that I had a very=20
bad experience, you say that yours has been more then satisfactory.  This=
=20
gives some balance to the situation.  Moreover, the shop is now owned and=
=20
run by different people, which probably means that my past experience has=
=20
no bearing on the present situation.  Therefore, I would have to say that=
=20
as far as I am concerned, there is no reason why one shouldn't check this=
=20
shop out and form their own opinion.  In fact, now that I am informed, I=20
would probably give Gandalf's a second chance if I needed help and was in=
=20
the area. =20

Kirk, thanks for the objective response.  Take it easy

&gt; Kirk,
&gt;=20
&gt; This is not really an answer to your (friends) dilemna, but I had to writ=
e when I saw mention of &quot;Gandalf's&quot;  When I lived in SF I was attracted by =
their ad with the picture of the &quot;VW wizard&quot; in the yellow pages.  I had be=
en hearing a valve lifter tapping slightly on occasion while warming up my =
Westy, then it would go away and stay away.  As I have since been told by s=
everal reputable sources, including seeing posts about this on this list, t=
his is a common problem with Vanagons.  It can mean time for a valve job (e=
specially if the sound doesn't go away) but that is a worst case seanario. =
 Usually it is just a sound if you can live with it.
&gt; My point?  A Gandalf's mechanic (Roger I believe was his name, maybe even=
 the owner) told me I needed a new engine or a rebuild, no if, ands or buts=
 about it.  I doubted this, said I'd think about it and decided to pass.  I=
 then proceeded to gather the info mentioned above.  Roger even called back=
 twice to ask when I was going to schedule my much needed engine replacemen=
t.  Well, 30k later (which includes 3 road trips of 6k+ apiece, subjecting =
my van to torturous weather, altitude and hill climbing conditions), the sa=
me engine runs perfectly.  Sorry Roger, I don't think so.  Don't take this =
wrong, I'm way over it (for all I know these may be your friends), but that=
 was my singular, what I would call, very negative experience with this sho=
p. As far as I'm concerned, they wanted to charge me $3000. for unneccesary=
 work.  If my experience with them was supposed to be &quot;magical,&quot; then I wou=

&gt; As I posted earlier, I recommend Fred's Garage in Redwood City for Bay ar=

&gt; &gt; Serious question, dude-man.  Driving down a dirt road, no problemas, go=
ing
&gt; &gt; maybe 25 mph, and the car died suddenly, no sputtering, no nothing, jus=
t
&gt; &gt; dead.  Still have electrical systems, battery, etc., just absolutely no
&gt; &gt; ignition.
&gt; &gt; &gt; We've had a number of occasions where the car &quot;burps&quot;, and stalls for=
 just =3D
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; second, like what I remember you describing yours doing.  I've also hea=
rd =3D
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; someone who's VW used to crap out for 10 minutes, then run fine again f=
or =3D
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; month, when it would happen again.  We've been baking in the sun for ab=
out =3D
&gt; &gt; 3
&gt; &gt; hours, waiting for a mechanic to show up, and nothing's improved.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Question on my mind is primarily whether the &quot;computer&quot; could totally=
 die.
&gt; &gt;  Also, I've only checked the basics, like loose wires and made sure the=
 =3D
&gt; &gt; rotor
&gt; &gt; is turning.  What else should I be checking?  Since it was so sudden, i=
t
&gt; &gt; seems like it must be electrical, like a loose or broken wire or that d=
urn
&gt; &gt; computer.  Where is the computer, anyway?  Is it the funky piece next t=
o =3D
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; air filter?  What about the &quot;controller&quot; under the back seat?
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you can e-mail some response pronto, please do.  We're probably sp=
ending=3D
&gt; &gt; &gt; the night here, and can call in for messages.  If you can relay =3D
&gt; &gt; information
&gt; &gt; from Rodrigo if the need arises, that would be awesome.  Depending on w=
hat
&gt; &gt; the mechanic can find or not find, we'll just call Rodrigo directly, si=
nce =3D
&gt; &gt; he
&gt; &gt; speaks Spanish anyway.  I appreciate any advice you have.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers mon,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dave (and Whitney).... late-breaking update:  we got towed to a garag=
e =3D
&gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt; a German guy looked at our car and found only a little bit of testabili=
ty =3D
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; the ignition system.  It looks like we'll replace our control unit.  I =
=3D
&gt; &gt; called
&gt; &gt; Gandalf's to find out how difficult it is to get the part, cuz we're go=
ing
&gt; &gt; nowhere til we get it.  I'll keep you posted.
