Subject: Re: What is VW Karma?


Why to trash the wheel covers?

My rims are hold by MBZ bolts, also I'm looking for 15&quot; MBZ rims.
My cap of the expansion tank is made for MBZ. The Camper is
powered by AUDI (hopefully it works soon).

What I'm driving? VW Camper, MBZ, AUDI?

Nothing of all, it's a brick, I got to feel it on every side wind
and every pothole but I love it to go everytime and everywhere I
want to, specially on long holiday trips. And therefore I like a
brick. Who wants to ask which wheel covers I have?
