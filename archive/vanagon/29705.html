Subject: Re: engine removal 71 bus

I have seen this magnetic tool.  It works fine, and I think it is sold as 
a bug-pack.  Looks like a boomerang with a 17 mm hex in the middle.  I 
have used, yes really, a bit of chewing gum under the head of this bolt, 
then push it in real good.  You can also use a bit of that gooey stuff 
you use to stick posters to the wall.  Both worked for me.  

You can also put this bolt in first, then lower the jack a bit to bind 
the bolt, this works fine if you think to do it.

&gt; The problem I have is not with the bolt turning, but not staying still 
&gt; 'til I get the nut on. The clean thread trick didn't work for me last 
&gt; Sunday, hence the willing (?) volunteer lying under the bus. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, next time I pull the engine I'll look for a solution before I 
&gt; have to call for volunteers.
&gt; 
&gt; My VW MAN, Ross, was saying that he had a tool he got from somewhere that 
&gt; had a magnet on it that stuck to the body and held the bolt in place from 
&gt; above the starter. 
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, some time ago the magnetised tool went out of his workshop 
&gt; still stuck the the body of the last car he used it on.
