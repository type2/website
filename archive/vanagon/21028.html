We had exactly the same problem with our 82. The dealer wanted some
outrageous amount  for it and we could not weld it. We ended going to A+A?
autowreckers in Sunnyvale. They removed the manifold for us and charged 60
dollars. You want to make sure that the manifold conforms to your specs
(EGR and cat) because it will vary significantly over the years and states.

I would first check all the wreckers in the area for an exhaust system and
then go and look at the manifold and make sure it is the same and have
them take it off for you....
