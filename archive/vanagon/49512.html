Subject: Re: 90 leaking oil out of drain plug

&gt; ineffective grommet, or a stripped drain plug.  If its a grommet, no 
&gt; problem, but if it is a stripped drain plug (which I suspect), is 
&gt; that a big deal?  I understand that there are self-tapping 
&gt; replacements for this, but is that a big deal?  big expense?  
&gt; potential problem?  I'm holding this quick lube place responsible for 
&gt; it no matter what, but I thought I should check with you guys first.

                   a thread insert put in. This if done right
                   it better than new\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
