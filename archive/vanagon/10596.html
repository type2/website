&gt;the list, I'm definitely changing my fuel filter and staying away from BP.

try the same brand from a different station ... some stations are really
the pits and don't take care of their tanks! it MIGHT not be texaco, but
just that station operator.

&gt;It is a blue cylindrical thing. Any idea how much it costs and if an
&gt;after-market RV-type pump would work? Also, do these pumps leave any kind

check with these guys for a catalog and general idea of what it's gonna cost
to get things working again. you might also check and see if a generic
windshield washer pump could work ... they are 12v and much cheaper than
anything with the vw/westfalia name on it. :)
