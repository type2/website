Hello Folks,

It's me again; the original poster. Looks like it was the ECU. My rich
running engine problem went away once the ECU swap was made. It cost
$250 but I paid an additional $50 core charge to keep the old one so I
could fix/have another as a spare. Wish I had known about your offer
Bill but this way I can make it out for the big weekend$$$$$$

By the way, a shop that I've worked well with over the years confirmed
the bad ECU, all other work was done by me. It looks like my mod to
the the AFM worked just fine. Joel, (my mechanic, not to be confused
with our own living data base ;) said there was no difference in 
operation between the old and new AFM's (remember I shifted the worn
resistive substrate). So, I would still recommend it.

I hate to think about the amount of money I've spent over the last week
but on the up side; I'm building up an iventory of parts I can swap out
for fault finding.

 Regards running rich,
   One VW mechanic I know told me once that the most common problem
causing this is the microswitches next to the airflow meter. The meter
works but the signal isnt transmitted to the ecu. These were about 50$
to replace on my '85.
   By going thru the same problem, I ended up with an extra ECU for an
85 [digijet]- let me know if anyone needs one-I'll give you a good deal
on it!
