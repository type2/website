It probably has something to do with the way VW marketed the Bus back in
the '50s and '60s.  They did not market it as a van nor a mini-van, but as
a station wagon.  

I would have to agree though, that in concept, the VW Bus was one of the
first &quot;mini-vans.&quot;

&gt; 
&gt; Can someone tell me what the definition of a &quot;Mini-Van&quot; is?
&gt; 
&gt; A week ago, a headline on 5/12/97 &quot;The New York Times&quot; caught my eye and
I
&gt; fed a dollar to the machine to snag a copy.
&gt; 
&gt; It read: &quot;For Mini-Vans, a Mid-Life Crisis at Age of 14&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Hmmm...&quot; I thought, &quot;The Bozobus is 36...&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Why is it that the now-fifty-year-old product of Volkswagen is not
&gt; considered a 'Mini-Van'?  Is the Microbus too small?  Is the Vanagon too
&gt; large?  Every Type II (except for the Eurovan) is older than the vehicle
&gt; that one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; pretentiously calls &quot;the first Mini-Van&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm surprised that VW let this ridiculous claim slide by.
&gt; But, then again, I'm not...
