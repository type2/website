Subject: Dave Black's status

So Joel points his finger:

&gt;
&gt;David Black            *103 Wanabus                AZ.N Flagstaff
                             ^^^^^^^

I've been exposed!!

Well, I sat for several days in my garage looking at my Westy, listening 
to Bill Abbott's tapes, and reached the unhappy conclusion that at this
point in my life I don't have the time or the money to properly take care
of it, so I put it up for adoption.

So now it resides in New Jersey, awaiting restoration(!!) by a youthful,
exurberant (and presumably cash-flush) former (and future) listmember
Erik Burtis.  A difficult decision, made slightly more bearable by the
knowlege that it goes to someone who will do the things to it that I
wish I could have.

To all those who have offered advice to me in the past: a heartfelt
thank you!  Know ye that come September, when Erik returns looking
for advice, we will all be helping him to breathe life into MY bus!

For now, I am offically a Wanabuser.  It may be a while, but I'll
eventually get another one!

ps--when I am seriously back in the market for one, it will probably
be a late '80's Westfalia (with all the trimings!).
