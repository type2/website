To All:

Should you have need for a small pressure vessel, welding together a pair of
stainless steel mixing bowls is usually much less expensive than having
something fabricated.  You'll need to weld on plates for threaded fittings
but mixing bowls have a conveniently flat bottom; the task is easier than
working with a true sphere.

A pair of bowls nine and a half inches in diameter held almost three and a
half gallons and was subjected to pressures as high as 200 psi.

I have seen bowls as large as twenty inches in diameter but as their diameter
increases they depart from a nearly hemispherical shape.  Still, for low
pressure applications they do a good job.
