Subject: does the list think there is a market for this part?

i am thinking of reproducing a new part for VW's and i want to get all the
feedback i can from the list.

the problem:
	safari window latches where out after 30 + years of use.  the
base, which is made out of 2 piece, breaks.  the pot metal base and the
steal shaft get loose and either break or bend.  NOS right side complete
latchs are available for about $50 each.  left sides are obsolete and if
found, sell for about $100 each.

what i want to do:
	i can get the bases reproduced here in california.  they would be
made out of steal and be one piece.  the final produce would have a
quality chrome job (triple plated) on it and be EXACT repro's of the
original German latch base.  My idea is that people could buy my bases and
switch out there old loose units.  The projected cost would be about $25
each.  i think there is a need and a market.

What i need from you all:
	input.  what do you all think.  in your opinions, would this be a
price you would pay if you needed them?  anything at all.  any info, new's
ideas?  send any thought you may have.

thanks in advance.

Take care and God Bless
matt
