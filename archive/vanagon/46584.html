Mark McCulley wrote while speaking of water pumps:
  &quot;Replacement pump prices can vary from $75 to $175.&quot;

  How about different pump's flow volume curves?  I know that by running 
tighter impeller to surrounding case clearances, idle flow can be greatly 
improved.  Similarly, a little tweeking, and if the typical drag strip 
creativity were applied to water pumps that will fit where stockers do,  
I'll bet we could have about twice the flow from a bolt-on replacement 
part.  Does anyone know of functional differences beyond price and 
probable bearing/seal life expectancy?

  Please also include diesels in this consideration.  We use those pumps 
too.
