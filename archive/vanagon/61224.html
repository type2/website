 This also freezes the odometer.  I could use it for a while by pulling the
 wand out a little, this trick no longer seems to fix.

Can't help much on the gas guage but I had the same thing with the odometer
on the Syncro.  One of the drive gears for the trip odometer, which drives
the other odometer had slipped out on it's shaft.  I pushed it back over
(twice, didn't do it far enough the first time) last year.  Haven't had
trouble since.
