All I can say about this: Read your car instructions carefully!
You will read that it is dangerous to place young kids on the
passengers seat when your car is equipped with air bags,
specially if you use baby seats which are faced backwards.
This instruction is also found (at VW's) as a sticker on the
top frame rail at the passengers door. No chance to miss this
sticker while opening this door.

BTW: In Europe we have only small size air bags which are
only useful while wearing seatbelts and having head rests.
But they also are dangerous for young kids.

Did anyone hear about an incident in Idaho where a one year was
killed by the air bag in the passenger seat of a new Jetta?

A very tragic story, made even more maddening because airbags were
legislated into place with seemingly little research into their
overall effect on safety. And no doubt, auto makers like VW will pay
the price in bad press and law suits, not unlike Audi did ten years
ago. Just one more sad example where politicians mess with things and
everyone else pays....

(sorry to be so depressing, guys...)
