Subject: Re: Tranny synthetic oil?


&gt; Guten Tag, all
&gt; 
&gt; I can't remember if this topic has been
&gt; covered or not, but what has been the
&gt; general experience with those of you
&gt; using something like, oh, say Redline MTL
&gt; in the tranny?  How noticeable is the 
&gt; change in shifting?
&gt; 
4 points of reference from my personal experience:

'88 Westy, 170k on rebuilt trans, slight grind in 2nd when cold, 
MTL improved this, although still occasional grind on very cold days 
(below -10c) for first 1-2 minutes.

'89 Westy, 240k on original trans, regular grind in 2nd, adding MTL 
made very little difference.

'85 Jetta, 370k on original trans, regular grind in 2nd gear, adding 
MTL cured almost completely... (added MTL around 330k)

'89 Jetta, 250k on original trans, same story as above.

It would *seem* that MTL makes less of a differnce in the Vanagon 
trans, although I don't know why. It made a huge difference in the 
Jetta though.
