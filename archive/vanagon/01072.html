Subject: coffee maker for my camper?


Does anyone know of a supplier for a coffee maker for my
'76 VW camper?  Anything that runs on 12V DC would be great.
Alternately something that can boil water in a reasonable
period of time would work OK also, though I'd especially
like a coffee machine.

Thanks,

-Randy
