Subject: HELP advise on purchase of '70 camper

O.K. this is my first chance at moving up from the Wannabus list and  
I would appreciate some pointers and suggestions.

I left a message on an answering machine of a house that has and old  
camper resting away in his back yard.  He called me back last night  
and told me it is a '71junker he hauled home for parts to fix up his  
'70 that he says is in &quot;decent&quot; shape, and yes he would part with the  
two of them.  I am going to look at them tomorrow morning and really  
have a couple questions that I need help with.  He says the '70 has  
&quot;some&quot; rust, the battery compartment is bad, and the sliding door he  
says has a problem.  He describes it as there is an area on the  
bottom track where water has a hard time getting out and it needs  
fixed because the door will jump out there if you aren't carefull. 


Also he describes a rubber drive bushing by the steering box that is  
bad and needs replaced ??  


 I know the battery compartment goes, but is the door rail one of the  
soft spots that goes first or can I expect lots of rust ?

What parts from a '71 would be usable on a '70 ?

He says it runs good, swears it has only 36K miles on it, canvas top  
is good, has an ice box, sink, and stove, also has an extra more  
powerfull engine in his basement that would go, and the '71 would go  
with it for $1000.00

Please advise if you can, and other high dollar repair things I  
should look for.



Thank you,

Bart  bwinelan_at_alleg_dot_edu
