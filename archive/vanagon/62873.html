&gt;Good morning All,
&gt;I just received  a note from Helmut suggesting an inter-cooler for my 1.9L

&gt;never seen one.

 &gt;Does this pre-cool intake air to make it more dense? 

Nope - it *post* cools compressed air...it's a radiator (air to air)
installed between the compressor (turbo) &amp; the intake manifold.
