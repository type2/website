Subject: 21 window for sale

I saw the following on halcyon.forsale:

I have a 21 window deluxe Volkswagen completely restored for sale
Price: $12,500 obo
The only things I don't like about it are that it pops out of 4th gear
and has stupid lowpro 80 series tires on it. Other than that it is
PERFECT!
contact me at home 206-776-7456 or page me a 969-8386 or email me
at kaos_at_rainier_dot_net.
I NEED A HOUSE DOWN PAYMENT!
Mike.
