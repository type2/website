Subject: Re: ASCII air on Vanagon

Those Four dots on the left of lever 4 are actually six dashes (on my 
'85).  Lever 4 controls the four roof vents, AND the two door vents, ergo 
SIX dashes.  These only emit cold air, so when it's cold out, I have this 
lever permanently to the right (off).  These six vents are even 
controlled by the fan (provided it isn't siezed and the circuit works 
#*$$%*#).
To shut off outside air, I put L1 to the left, and L2&amp;4 to the right. 
When moving down the freeway, it does get a bit loud as the air getting 
rammed into the distribution box is trying to find somewhere to go...

&gt; Don't let the ASCII art scare you, it's just a poor
&gt; representation of the heater cable plate graphics.  The air
&gt; cooled folk seem to think that once you're cooking with
&gt; water, all your heating problems are over.  Actually, it
&gt; just means it's time to figure out what four dots is the
&gt; international symbol for.
&gt;  
&gt; Now, does anyone know anything about the (rarely used)
&gt; little sliding vents in the doors?
