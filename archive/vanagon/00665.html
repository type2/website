Subject: Re: Roll Call

1990 Vanagon Westphalia
vacation + commute

underpowered, should have a 5-speed transmission, difficult to shift to 2nd
expensive and flaky service, A/C dead
superb turning radius, fits into little camping spots under trees
carries all we need

vehicle to many of my happiest times.  My youngest child, now 10 (and friends)
and I love it.

Freeze these moments; I will wish I could come back to them in future.
