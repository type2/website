Subject: Re: 65 bus question

This is my first post so please forgive me if I get it all wrong. I am
looking at a very nice 65 bus camper. The person is asking 3500.00 for it.
There is no rust and it was painted a year ago. Everything works and the
inside looks good.
----------

this could be a fair price - if it is in really good shape.  A reliable, nice
looking, solid split is not easy to come by.

Do they have receipts for the motor - is it fairly new and built by someone
reliable ?  warranty?

is there bondo? use a magnet on the nose, etc. check for rust in front wheel
wells, and the rocker panels (at the bottom on each side)   windows seals
replaced?  look for holes under the front floor mat.   look under the bus at
the frame and jack points.

does it drive well?   lights and horn work?  stop well and evenly (no pulls)
.   the steering shouldn't have more than an inch or so of play.  shift
nicely and not pop out of any gears?

hope you are happy with it if you buy it.   :)
