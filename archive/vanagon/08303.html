So David Kao says:
&gt; 
&gt; I thought London is the fog capital of the world. Where in the world is
&gt; Manteca? Hmmm... Just wondering...
&gt; 

Manteca is in the armpit of California.  60 miles south of Sacramento
in the Central Valley.

I believe London fog is a different type of fog than that of the
valley &quot;Tulie&quot; (Thick as lard) fog.
