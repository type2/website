Subject: Update: Parting Out Syncro :-)
Date: Sat, 17 May 1997 10:41:56 -0400

To all,
	A quick update: the transmission and front diff are pretty much spoken
for, although I'm not sure what will become of them. If anyone is
interested in the shell when I'm finished let me know. I saw almost no rust
anywhere on the van. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Here's the scoop... 87' Syncro Vanagon, 120k, AC, no engine, slight front
end damage (about 5mph collision to drivers corner), small crack in
windshield. Everything else is there and appears in order and good shape.
The center driveshaft looks in excellent shape and probably is not the
orginal. Over all the van looks like it had been pretty well cared for. It
hasn't been parked long and the engine was removed because it needed a
desperate rebuild. Instead of reinstalling, the owner put the engine in
something else???. Did not get a good look at the interior, it was stuffed
with boxes. 

	Here's my deilema, I am going to buy this creature and part it out. It is
actually a good resto candidate, but I just don't have that kind of
money right now. Unfortunately, the owner wants a pretty penny for the van
and I'm looking for someone who needs a hard to find part or two. Syncro
gas tanks, center drivehhafts, skid plates are pretty hard to find.  
Personally, I don't really need any of the parts, but I want to sell my
syncro sometime soon and would like to have some good replacement parts to
add along with the deal to sweeten things so-to-speak. 

	So If any of you syncroites want to store some more parts in your attics,
get back with me soon. I'm not trying to make alot of money here, and will
be more than happy to spread the good fortune of this find along to other
listmembers. Make me an offer on the parts you want and if it's fair their
yours.
