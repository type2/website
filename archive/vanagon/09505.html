Right!  I forgot about that great 12v hairdryer.  The amount of
DC power consumed on this one trip must have been phenomenal.  Not
to mention propane.  Not to mention how it could give us all such
great things - like the ice cream bars David Schwarze kept in
his freezer (and I mean a REAL freezer!).

Steve:  face it, you married a camping goddess.  That Linda knows
how to rough it in grand style.  She had absolutely EVERYTHING anyone
needed, whether it be butter, eggs, oil, a twistie, dishwashing items,
etc.  We're going to set the next trip to HER convenience!

Speaking of which, in general people I think exhibited an interest
in doing this every 8-12 weeks or so.  Does anyone want to nominate
a place and time for the next one?  A suggestion for the desert
was made, but I can't remember for which one, or how far away it
was.

On the next trip, I'm going to enlist the help of the other females
to do a beer frisk - GAWD, you guys had SO MANY bottles.  How can you
drink that stuff in the cold?  I mean, there was glass and caps 
EVERYWHERE - that alley between our vans looked worse than skid row.
Disgusting!  ;)
