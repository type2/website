&gt;tires will not be P44's, but won't be Michelins either.  I've had
&gt;some white knuckle experiences with Michelins on sports cars in
&gt;the rain that made me loose bladder control...  =:-0
&gt;
&gt;Maybe the answer is to avoid European rubber...

In the FWIW department, I've heard (and had some personal experience)
that French Michelins are better than American Michelins.  My bladder
control experience didn't even happen in a sports car...just a Golf.
Sworn by P44's on my regular size cars ever since, and recently got
P300's for the van.
