Subject: Re: VWoA warranty - any recent experience?


&gt;
&gt;My 93 EV is coming up on the 2 year expiration of the date it
&gt;was &quot;put into service&quot; (as VW says).  I have until the end of October 
&gt;to get all my nit-picky things taken care of - or so I thought.  I
&gt;suddenly remembered that the warranty is 2 years or 24K miles, whichever
&gt;comes first, and I've just hit 26.2K.  What a sickening feeling.  Besides 
&gt;being mad at myself for spacing on the miles, I'm not too happy with the
&gt;2 dealers I've called 'cause they're not cutting me much slack.  They're
&gt;both giving me the same line : &quot;bring it in, we'll look at what needs work, 
&gt;then see what percentage VW will pay.  And by the way, don't put any more
&gt;miles on it, or the percentage VW *might* pay will go down.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Anybody been through something like this?  Is there a &quot;percentage they'll
&gt;pay formula&quot; anyone knows the details of?  They're being very vague.
&gt;

I just had my 93 EV in for replacement of the instrument cluster voltage
stabilizer. I had 28K on the odo.  I paid $7 + change, or 20% of the total
charge.  The service manager referred to it as VWoA &quot;good will&quot;.  Whatever
it is, it's OK by me -- many other brands you pay 100% after expiration of
warranty.
