&gt; Pardon me, but what is a &quot;wrench?&quot;  Where do I plug it in to make my bus go?

&gt; Oh...  I get it.  Never mind.  I guess I should go and wash or something.

While rotating the tires on the '85, I found this metal thing in the bag
with the jack.  It is marked &quot;10&quot; at one end &quot;13&quot; at the other.  Is this a
wrench?  Or is it some kind of magic de-tighten und unloosen device from
VW-GMbH?
