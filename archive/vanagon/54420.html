Subject: '86 heated driver's seat cold

Hello. My wife would like to keep her behind warm in the winter, but the
seat doesn't heat. My repair manual doesn't cover the wiring for the seat
heater, so does anyone know? Using my multimeter and scratching my head, I
seem to find an open circuit, if so, I suppose something has broken and
needs to be replaced. I haven't tried to take the seat apart yet, has
anyone?
