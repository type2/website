Subject: Michelin tire report (bay window/vanagon)

For those of you who are looking to replace those old Michelin XZX 185 R 14
reinforced tires:

Just bought a set of MX reinforced, Michelin's replacement for the XZX.

Thing is, not all tire shops know that the MX comes in a reinforced version.
To make things even more confusing, this tire also comes in a &quot;Rainforce&quot;
version, which could lead to all kinds of misunderstanding over the phone. I
simply called around until I found a dealer who knew the tire and had the
*reinforced* version in stock.

They're expensive: around $80/tire out here in California, on sale.

Cheers,
