&gt;This kind of speaks sadly of the direction VW has taken on quality when you
&gt;take the above into consideration.

while true, i think it is also indicative of the direction of engineering in
our modern world: just enough to get by. no more over-strength last-forever
tools or cars. just make it last until the warranty expires.

after all, if a washing machine lasts forever, you'll never need to buy
another one, would you? it's just the engineering of economics.

and very sad it is, too.
