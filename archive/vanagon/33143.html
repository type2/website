It wasn't a VW it was an Audi (hey it had a VW engine in it.)

Replacing rear shocks on the beast I had the car jacked up and was 
positioning a block of wood between the jack stand and the body when the 
jack slipped. Caught the index finger of my left hand between the block of 
wood and the body. Here I am home alone with my finger stuck under a car.

The jack was on the left side of the jack stand. I got the jack out from 
under the car (this was one of the silly jacks that look like half a 
scissors jack) and was able to get it back under the car on the right side 
of the stand and jack the car off my finger. Hmm finger felt a little numb 
but no obvious damage. So I finished the shock job. Returned the spring 
compressor that I did not need back to the rental place. Delivered the 
finger (with body attached) to the hospital. They xrayed the finger no 
damage. Just a little numb.

Now when I am going to be working under a car and nobody is around to drag 
me out I take a cordless phone with me.....
