Subject:      94 EV PS hose

So, a hose to the ps started to leak for me. It went leak in one of the
pressings to the couplings it is fitted with. It was a real pain to
change, and a good amount of hard words was neccesary. But now the oil
is changed in the ps, so some good came out of it. =


VW oil to the ps is very expensive, 130 SEK/lit, $16/quart.gal....
Wonder if ATF fluid could be used? Always uses it in Scania and Volvo
trucks, but I took no chances with my syncro.
