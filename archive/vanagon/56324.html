Sorry to bring this up again, I know much of this was covered not too 
long ago.  Didn't think I would ever consider an automatic, so I didn't 
read or save them.
My questions are about automatic transmissions in the 88 westies.  Are 
there any major problems with them; should I avoid them.  I realize it 
won't have the same acceleration as the 4 speeds, but are they painfully 
slow and sloppy?  Is it a 3 speed?  How long do they last.
