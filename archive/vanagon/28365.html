                Sometimes Things Happen Like They Should

        This morning I was on my way to work after breakfast with my Dad and 
brother (once a week) and I had turned on to the tollway frontage road 
northbound.  My traffic had to stop at a light, after which those of us 
getting on the tollway merge over one lane and into the toll gate.  I don't 
have a toll tag (automatic electronic toll charge card thingie), so I always 
have to stop to hand the attendant my 25 cents.  This seems to anger some 
people.  I guess they think that if we don't have a toll tag, we shouldn't 
be able to use the road.  This morning Beatrice ('73 Campmobile) and I 
seemed to anger a young professional in her Saab 900 Turbo.  As soon as I 
paid the attendant and started accelerating, she was on my tail.  There was 
no way she was going to enter the tollway with me, no siree.  So as B and I 
are going through the gears (rather nicely I thought), about a hundred feet 
past the toll gate she crossed all the white lines, over the smooth, paved 
drainage area and sped onto the tollway, into the middle lane and past me.  
As she passed me, I noticed that right behind her was a DPS Trooper (his car 
said so) with his lights on.  It took a few hundred feet for her to see him, 
but they pulled off to the shoulder together.  I pulled into the middle lane 
from the right lane before I passed so I wouldn't be a hazard if they wanted 
to get out.......
