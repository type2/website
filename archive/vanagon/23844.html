&gt;My suggestion for a motor transplant is to use a rotory engine from an RX7.
&gt;It is small. It pumps out a bunch of horses. It has a German heritage
&gt;(Wankel). OK, so it aint gonna be cheap.

Yeah, but it does it by turning 8,000+ RPM. Can the tranny handle it?

&gt;More speed = More money. More money = More speed. This is true except for
&gt;putting money in vanagon motors.

KEP refers to the souped-up VW engine as &quot;an expensive firecracker
with a short fuse&quot;. A somewhat self-serving statement, since you don't
have to buy one of their adapters to put it in. Still, the ubiquitous
air-cooled VW engine does seem a little tightly strung to me-- get
ANYTHING a little bit off (mixture, valve adjust, advance, oil level),
and the engine will quickly self-destruct in a bus unless you set it
back the way it should be RIGHT NOW. When I do that to my Mustang's
302, it just runs shitty, but still lasts 200K miles. Course, it
weighs 600#, too...

If you want lotsa horsepower, get something that was designed to
make lotsa horsepower. The VW wasn't.
