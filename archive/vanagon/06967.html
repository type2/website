Subject:      magazine article: adjusting water-boxer fuel injection

i can't find this article you guys were talking about. the only one from
Hot VWs that i've found is from October of 1982 called:

Fixen der Einspritzer: troubleshooting efi fuel injection.

it's a 3-part article (i have all 3) and is concerned with the D- and L-
jetronic efi in the first two parts and the CIS injection in the last part.
no digijet or digifant anywhere (cause they hadn't been invented yet).

sorry guys and gals. anybody else got that article?

joel
