&gt;Trying to remember my old '72.  It had lots of metal so you should be

&gt;I'd think the front bumber mounts could somehow be used on the bus, the 
&gt;bumber itself might be a little weak.  But I'm really only guessing.

Thanks for your reply, Bill. Just went to check and you're right about
there being a lot of metal. In particular, there is some sheetmetal
protuberance that is &quot;enveloped&quot; by the bumper, which looks like a good
spot and that David Schwarze pointed out to me.
