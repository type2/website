Subject:      vwoa strikes again ...

well, i'm not sure how to take this:

there is a 80-82 camper at the local vw dealer. it's been sitting inside
his fenced 'yard' for at least two years now. i tried several times to
talk to someone about it, but never found anyone who knew the story behind
it.

so finally, i went to the top: talked to the top-dog. he says it's a
salvage car. vwoa bought it back from the owner, and has stripped the VIN
from it. and they are letting it sit there (while paying the dealer monthly
storage fees) until they decide to come get it and crush it. :(

and all those camper parts are going to waste.

of course, they'd much rather sell you NEW camper parts ...

this does not make me feel all warm and friendly toward VWOA. :(
