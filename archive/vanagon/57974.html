Subject: recognizing each other at kelley park?


How about if all of us from the internet who plan to attend the
Kelley park function this weekend wear a small white bracelet
on our left wrist?  This could be simple, like just made out
of 1/2&quot; white paper and a little scotch tape, and we won't risk
missing each other that way.  I know it's a little dorky, but
otherwise, we have to look for cars, and ask at each stage, and
this gives us a better chance to meet everyone and use the time
visiting instead of searching.
