Subject: Friendly Waves

To All:

I'm thundering across New Mexico west-bound on I-40, puffing on my pipe,
sipping coffee from a metal cup.  White Vanagon blows by me doing maybe
seventy.  Woman driving, kid about a dozen years old with his nose glued to
the side window, big grin as I flash him a wave.  I see him turn to the
woman, talking with animation, motioning back toward me as the Vanagon zooms
on down the road.  

Passed them at a rest stop.  Kid waves like crazy.  I give him a beep.  No
sigh of the woman.  They pass me again, maybe an hour later.  Kid keeps his
eyes staight ahead.  When they pull in I see the woman lecturing the kid,
raising him up right, telling him the perils of friendliness and waving at
strangers.  They flew up the grade and I didn't see them again.  Arizona
plates.
