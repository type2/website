&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; 
&gt;&gt;         MY speedometer is not accurate. Can somone tell me
&gt;&gt;         if your tach is running 3,000 RPM in 4th gear what
&gt;&gt;         speed are you going in 4th gear. MY speedo. says
&gt;&gt;         I'm going 53 MPH.
&gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;


        Find someone with a GPS, they almost all have a spedo function built
into them.  I put mine on my dash one afternoon out of curiousity, when the
spedo said that I was going 55 it said that I was going apx. 51mph.

        It does seem to take the GPS quite a while to give a solid speed
reading so you can only test this somewhere that you will be traveling at
the same speed for several minutes.
