&gt;&gt;This may seem dumb, but ever since I've had my Vanagon I've wondered what 
&gt;&gt;that round silver thing under the clock, that looks like a cigarette 
&gt;&gt;lighter is.  I've looked through the books and nothing is mentioned.  
&gt;&gt;Could someone shed some light on the thing.   Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;This is definitely one for the FAQ.

I've added a section on the silver socket.  See the faq at
