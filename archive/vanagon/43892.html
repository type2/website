&gt; I have discovered that Kelly Blue Book publishes a volume for older vehicles.
&gt; The current issue is May-August 1966, '76--89 Cars and Trucks.  My credit
&gt; union has a copy that members can read, but not copy or remove from the
&gt; premises.

&gt;       Special
&gt;       Announcement

NADA also publishes their older car book, I think current one covers much
the same as this, only the last couple years of Bus are in it, my local
library keeps a copy try yours.
