Subject: Clutch replacement questions.

Ok. So, for the second time in less than a year, I've replaced my clutch.
I'm getting good at this, but I really don't WANT to get good at it.  I 
want my clutch to last.  
The clutch fails because the front engine seal fails.  I pretty firmly 
believe that the seal is failing because the crankshaft has too much end 
play.  (I measured it &lt;grin&gt;)
Ok. With a dial indicator, the endplay in the crankshaft (with all the 
shims in) is about .015 inches.  The wear limit is .006.  
My (and my dad's) question is this: The flywheel keeps the crankshaft 
from sliding back (FIF).  What surface keeps the crankshaft from sliding 
forward and has worn more than  .011 inch? (It's about .004 when it's 
new). 
Is this a reasonable wear? (165,000 miles).  The engine doesn't knock or 
make any other noises and runs decent.

Can I get shims which will work for this?  I have shims .011 thorugh 
.015.  Are there smaller sizes? Bigger sizes?  

Is it ok to put 4 shims?
Bentley says 3. I can understand not wanting fewer, but is more ok?

Thanks for your advice.  I'm going to collect lots of data, and then I'm 
going to do this all again.  Maybe even before I destroy this clutch.
