Howdy,

	I wasn't in a sanding mood tonight, so I did some sprucing on
my interior.

	I painted the flat areas around the cargo area windows, doors and
hatch with my favorite Krylon Battleship Gray.  Looks alot better in
there now!

	I also shot some undercoating in the doors.

	Does it make sense to put the undercoating in the doors?  It did at
the time, but now I wonder if the cost/benefit ratio is worth it...

	Also, for interior finish, in the cargo area, around the windows, 
I am going to put a layer of thin foam on the painted metal, and cover it
with VW-style vinyl (with the dots) Does this make sense too?  I thought
the foam (about 1/8&quot;) would give it a nice padded look without being 
bulky, and absorb some of the interior noise (of which there is
an abundance!
	
	Here's your chance to influence my bus!

Thom
