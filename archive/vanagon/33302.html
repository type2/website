Subject: '71 Ignt. swtch. chart (for whoever was looking)

Below is the ignition switch wiring chart from MY '71 Westy.  The switch is
a replacement from RMMW, but the wires all matched colors with the exceptions
noted below.  I can't swear that the PO didn't change any wiring, but it all
LOOKS original, with the possible exception of maybe the black wire going to
the light switch.  BUT, it DOES all work, including the coil getting 12V in
the start position.  :-)

   WIRE                  FROM/TO                         DESCRIPTION

Red/Black            from switch to starter         12V when in &quot;START&quot; position
Black                from switch to fuse box and
                     ignition coil                  12V when in &quot;ON&quot; and
                                                    &quot;START&quot; position

Red                  from battery to switch         12V at all times (straight

Brown/Blue(2)        door buzzer                    connected to GND when key
