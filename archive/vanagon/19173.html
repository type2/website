Subject: Re: Is owning a van probable cause?

So Ben Heavner says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm planning on driving my '77 non-hippie, normal colored, van from here
&gt; in Lubbock to Tacoma WA for school.  What are you all's experiences with
&gt; getting stopped/harassed by police for driving a van?  Being an 18 year
&gt; old male probably doesn't help... have any of you actually been pulled
&gt; over and serched for drugs?
&gt; Since I'm not the original owner (it is only 4 months younger than me),
&gt; should I worry about someone's stach hidden in the seat cushin or
&gt; something? 
&gt; Or is it stupid to worry about that since I don't use drugs?
&gt; 
&gt; Remember:  just because you're not paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out
&gt; to get you.

You're paranoid.  But stay on the interstates as much as possible.  The
locals in some counties still need the extra income.

Make sure you have enough drugs to share with the local officials. ;)
