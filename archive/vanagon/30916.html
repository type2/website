&gt;That's all I have for now.  If you ever see an aircooled in a movie, even
&gt;just for a second, please let me know!!

Also, in _How to Make An American Quilt_ (still in theaters maybe), Winona's
fiance drives an old Splittie bus which they use to make love in at the end
of the film (obviously, one of the _prime_ reasons to own a Bus rather than
a Bug. . .)

Often when I watch '60s movies on t.v., I look for street scenes showing
Bugs or buses.  Generally you can always catch one or two in the background
someplace, but they get rarer in the really _old_ movies (mid-fifties and
earlier.)  It's a fun late-night pasttime especially when the movie itself
isn't too interesting.  Of course, the _Woodstock_ film has more Bugs 'n'
Buses than you can count.  Here, the game to play is &quot;Guess the year!&quot;
