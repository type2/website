Having almost been in a situation where it mattered recently, I
observed that the generic American car that I was rapidly approaching
would probably be contacted bumper-to-bumper.  This being the case,
the concern is mostly the trunk trying to merge with the front seat
support.  Although it might not look to good on the skid mark test,
I've come to the conclusion that the best thing to do, if you know
you're going to hit with any significant speed, is to pull your legs
up.

Of course, if the other vehicle involved is one of those trucks that
doesn't have a bumper, but rather just a piece of angle iron thirty-
some-odd inches above the pavement, it doesn't matter what you do....
