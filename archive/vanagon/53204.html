&gt;        I am about ready to bring it to a shop so they can use the air guns 
&gt;      on it--if they are this stuck are the air guns likely to break a stud? 
&gt;      Can you replace a single stud?  Judging from the lugs nuts, it's not 
&gt;      going to be pretty getting the drums off either--so maybe the shop is 
&gt;      the best option.  Any advice on this situation?  
&gt;      
     Studs will not break.  Get a 4 way lug wrench. Stand on one end,
     as someone else pulls up on the other end. You can get about
     400 ft pounds of force like this. If it doesn't come off, most
     air guns will not work ether. The next step is a torch.

     VW, I have found, has a real problem with over tight lug bolts.
       I think this is because of the precision of the bolt rim
       interface, being to accrate. I always tighten mine by hand 
       or use a torch wrench.

      NEVER LET THE BRAIN DEAD CORNER MECHANIC TIGHTEN THE LUGS
      WITH AN AIR WRENCH.
