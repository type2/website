Subject:       Hi-Top Conversions - anybody????

Hello - can anyone help...
Restoring my friend's 1963 Kombi we came across a plaque which says 
it is a conversion by &quot;Hi-Top&quot; which nobody seems to of heard of.  It 
did have a &quot;pop-top&quot; which wasn't standard, but can anyone tell what 
was involved in this conversion or where it was from???
Thanks - this is just a question out of interest for my friend not 
out of neccessity.
By the way it is a UK conversion - 

cheers
