     Hi All,
     
       I tried this site before I found this list.  I posted a message in 
     the Tips section (this is were I saw similar requests posted) but did 
     not get a single response (in fact it is still there and unresponded 
     to).  Good idea on the format but not a very interactive site.  I have 
     since removed this book marker.  
     
     Regards,
     
     Vince
