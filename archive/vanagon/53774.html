&gt; 	Has anybody done any mild customizing to their Vanagons? I'm
&gt; looking for tasteful bolt-on dress up things like chin spoilers, ground

&gt; wheels. I've looked for cast wheels locally, and from the Tire Rack, but
&gt; the best I could do were older Mercedes replica wheels (uglier than my
&gt; current VW wheel covers) or the 5 spoke VW Weekender wheels (gorgeous, but
&gt; $500 cdn). Any bug meets I've attended have beautiful spltties &amp;
&gt; breadloafs displayed, but vanagons are just plain vanilla haulers in the
&gt; parking lot.

D&amp;W of Germany has some spoilers and ground effects, however they are very
expensive.  Good Luck.
