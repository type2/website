Subject: &quot;House Car&quot; tags

I live in southeastern PA and I have recently purchased an 83.5 Westfalia.  My 
question is, sometimes I see Westy's with &quot;House Car&quot; tags here in PA, or with 
&quot;Mobile Home&quot;, etc. on Westy's from other states.  My van just has regular 
tags.  What is the pre-requisite for these tags?

Thanks,
Bryan
