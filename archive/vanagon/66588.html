Subject:      Re: Replacing radio antenna

Leo,

 I removed mine, 91 Carat, by pulling the housing out from the top of the
fenderwell.

The trick is to eyeball the first of two uh er I'll call'em &quot;dull barbs&quot;on
the side of the housing base beneath the sheetmetal which hold the thing
in. Once you see the first one, rotate the housing until the barb is in the
12:00 position, pull the mast to the front of the van until the barb tip
clears the sheetmetal.

Next with  upward pressure rotate the housing 180 degrees and repeat the
procedure about seeing the barb and pulling the mast.

That should free the housing. To put the new cable in, if, and mine does
not, your cable dettaches from the housing your set.  If it doesn't I'd cut
the cable and try to use it to &quot;pull&quot; the new cable to the radio.

Hope I've Helped

&gt;Hello Vanfans:
&gt;I have an '85 vanagon with a fully retractable antenna housing implanted in
&gt;the wheelwell.

&gt;I've looked at it from many angles and I can't see the most efficient route.
&gt;Help.
&gt;What is the fastest and most efficient way to replace this antenna?
