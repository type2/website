&gt; A '83 water-cooled with 113k miles starts showing signs of
&gt; bad headgaskets. It will cost $1,200 to replace the gaskets.
&gt; Besides either selling it or replacing the gaskets, what
&gt; other reasonable option does the owner have? 

Do it yourself.  $1,200??  What a joke...  For $1,200 I would take my
van completely apart down to the last washer and reassemble it!
Get some manuals, leave your terminal running so you can run in and ask
Joel for advice, and replace those puppies.  Then take a trip to
Acapulco with the money you saved...
