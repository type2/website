Hello Dennis.  One thing to remember regarding tires for the Syncro 
is not only load rating, but also tire pressure.  Most tires can't 
take the 43 psi front, 53 psi rear pressures.  This is imperitive for 
proper handling and weights.  IMHO, I wouldn't touch a tire for a 
Syncro that wasn't a load range D, and couldn't handle the 
recommended tire pressures by VW.

Just my .02.
Harry.

&gt; Syncro.  The load rating is 96T. (1554lbs _at_ 35psi, 118mph)
&gt; 
&gt; Michelin MX-4 should be an excelent rain/touring tire.  205 is raised black
&gt; letters, 215 is white wall.  the 205 s rated 95T.(1490lbs), The 215 is rated
&gt; 96S,(112 mph).
