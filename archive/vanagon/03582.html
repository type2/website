 Hi,
	OK, I'm off the list (sob, sniff) while Judy and I take off for a year
or so round the world. I'll be back when I start working again, hopefully
kitting a breadloaf out with a flat six :-).

 Thanks for all your help, see you on the Transporter Trek!

	W.

PS. My email address should still work, I'll try to log on occasionally.
