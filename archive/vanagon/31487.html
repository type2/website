Volks,

I came across this poor guy on rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled, and I just 
had to take pity on the guy.  Seeing as it's the solstice season, I 
thought I'd report his problem here.  If anyone wishes to reply, BE SURE 
TO CC HIS PERSONAL ADDRESS, since I doubt (somehow ;-)) that he's a list 
member.
