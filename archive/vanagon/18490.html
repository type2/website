Subject: Re: bodega update 5/30

To the folks going up early Friday.  I have 3 comercial radios that I 
stole^H^H^H^H^Hborrowed from work.  I plan on following Martha, and we'll 
each have a radio, and I'll have 1 extra if someone else wants to join in 
on the convoy.  They're on the 155 Mhz frequncy, so should have about a 
half mile range.

Bradley
