Subject: 65 bus question

This is my first post so please forgive me if I get it all wrong. I am
looking at a very nice 65 bus camper. The person is asking 3500.00 for it.
There is no rust and it was painted a year ago. Everything works and the
inside looks good.

I am not sure the size of the engine but it has Dellortos carbs and dual
exhaust. The rear bumper is not orginal due to the exhaust.

I know nothing about these and I could be taken because I want a camper like
this. I have looked around on the net and the price seems high but then
again here in the east one does not find rust free VWs. My big problem is I
don't know what are the right questions to ask about it. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks
-Rick
