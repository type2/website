I haven't bought a new one yet.  I replaced mine with the one for the 
rear heater which I don't have.  Joel got me a new switch when he got me 
the new rear heater which turned out to be leaky (no fault of his, mind 
you).  The prior switch for the rear heater was melted the same way this 
one was.  Looks like it's going to be one of those things that I just 
always have with me in the winter.  Or maybe I'll replace it with a 
decent switch and mount it somewhere else.
