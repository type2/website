&gt;This is Jim, I'm confused!  Please give me yes or no answers to these 
&gt;specific questions.

I know you'd like just easy yes &amp; no answers, but some questions cannot be
adequately answered with a yes or a no.  &quot;Have you stopped beating your
wife?&quot; for example.

&gt;Can I put 205/70's on my diesel?  Some say sure, some say expect disaster.
&gt;I'm confused...yes or no.

This size tire can surely be put on your van, but the real question is can
they be put on your van's wheels.  A competent tire shop can look up the
allowable rim widths for each tire he sells and compare that information to
the width of your rim and answer this question.  It is likely that you have
5.5 inch wide rims and that 205/70s will fit.

&gt;Can I use a high load rated tire instead of a &quot;reinforced&quot; tire?

Yes, if the load rating is high enough.  Get the highest load rating you can
find, especially if your van is a Westy.

&gt;Will it handle okay if I do this?

Handling varys alot from one tire model to another.  Also, what you percieve
as &quot;okay&quot; is totally subjective.  The answer is probably.

&gt;Does the &quot;s&quot; in 185/75 sr 14 mean sidewall reinforcement.  I don't think 
&gt;it does but I've been told it does and it doesn't...I'm confused...a guy 
&gt;at a tire store said it stands for standard.

I think the S initially stood for Steel, as in Steel Radial.  Later, this
position in the tire number was used for the tire's speed rating.   S was
good for xx miles/hour, H for xxx miles/hour, V for XXX miles/hour, etc.  It
has nothing to do with sidewall reinforcement designation.

&gt;I've got four different kinds of tires on my van right now, a 185 xzx, a 
&gt;continental &quot;reinforced&quot; something or other, and two no name crap tires.  
&gt;One &quot;good tire is on the back left and the other is no the front right.  
&gt;My van drives like s**t.  Help me buy 4 tires that I can run out and put 
&gt;on this week.  Name the  brand you like.

I have the 6&quot; wide alloy wheels on both of my Vanagons, so my tire options
might be a bit different than yours.  Also, I use my Syncro for occasional
off-road use, so the tires that I have on it, may not be a good choice for
you.

On my 87 GL Syncro, I have BF Goodrich Radial All Terrain T/A tires in size
27LT-8.5/14.  (27&quot; diameter, Light Truck duty)

On my wife's 88 GL Wolfsburg, I have Goodyear Aquatread (the original model,
not their newer one) in size 205/70-14.  These have a fairly high load rating
but are not specially reinforced.

Good Luck,
