Subject: Need Microfiche Reader for VW parts films

Anyone happen to know where I could find a microfiche reader halfway 
cheap that will read the big VW parts films?

p.s. In the meantime, if you asked for a quote on a &quot;dealer only&quot; part, 
please be patient.  I'll have 'em tomorrow; doing it the hard way :(
