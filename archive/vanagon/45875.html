but not this elbow.

Hi Glen -
Your's is not the first request for this item, we've had a ton of 'em.  And
of course, every used one we've found as well has cracks forming on it as,
which would be expected after 15 to 24 years of use and exposure.  No dealer
in the USA is even stocking them anymore, so we're working on getting 'em
direct outa Europe if possible.  I've even gotta feeler working in Mexico to
see if they're the same on the Buses made down there and if we can get some
up here to keep the costs down (about $80US for this piece of hose if I have
to get 'em outa Germany!).  We'll keep you &amp; the list posted.  BTW this hose
fits 72-79's.
