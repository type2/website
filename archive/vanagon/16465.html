my shifter used to not feeel to good too...IT FIXED ITSELF !!!!!  the
procedure was as follows:

talk really nicely [read 'curse violently'] to your reverse gear while
pushing your van backwards.  go out to drive it one day and discover that
not only has reverse returned from the dead, but _everything_felt good.

simple huh?

btw my stearing is very light also.  one hand in parking lots even :)
