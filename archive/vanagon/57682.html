Subject: Re: Re:91 power window shot

I just took out the motor and cleaned all the rust out and then oiled it.  It
then spun freely, but sounds sick when in use.  It is still working after 3
weeks, but seems to be working at only 1/2 the power.  Greased regulator,
which seemed to help, but still is sluggish.  We are in search of a new motor
or one off a wrecked one.  Unfortunately they are in high demand.  Someone
recommended looking for an audi one.  Do the motors completely die or can
they become slowly weaker? ANy suggestions?  Dan
