Norman asked about &quot;stealth&quot; type type IIs...
&gt;I guess a bus with no badges doesn't have quite the same effect as an
&gt;MB w/o badges, eh?


When I was in Munchen about 10 years ago I visited the BMW factory.
The tourguide mentioned all of the different types of accessories
one could get on a BMW through the factory. He pointed out a car
without any type of &quot;model&quot; badging on it and said there was
a &quot;delete option&quot; package so you could order a car w/o model
badges. He said there were two reasons, one not to draw attention
on the autobahn from the boy racers, the other was to &quot;hide&quot; the
identity of the model from the tax authorities.

I wonder how many &quot;boy racers&quot; tangle with stealth Typ 2s??  ;-)
