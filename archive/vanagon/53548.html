&gt; Hi all,
&gt;          Well I finally crawled under the Westy to find out which water
&gt; hose broke that ruined my drive home from a Christmas Eve party,and left
&gt; me stranded on I5. It turned out to be a split in the plastic manifold
&gt; that 4 hoses attach to just ahead of number 1 cylinder. I have read many
&gt; times on the list about a plastic part in the coolant system that fails
&gt; and that VW made a metal replacement for. Is this the part that everyone
&gt; has had trouble with. If it is then something someone said sometime back
&gt; is wrong. I remember it being said that VW changed this part to metal on
&gt; the Syncros. Mine is a early Syncro and the part is still plastic. I
&gt; wish it would have been metal. If this is not the part that has been
&gt; discussed on the list, exactly wich part is it?  Thanks
    
   I am under the imppresion that this part in no longer avalable.
   It was problably changed ever so slitly in newer synros and
   can be modified to fit. Mine blow the plug off the end as I 
   was about to change the oil. Let us knoe what you find.
