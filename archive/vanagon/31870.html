Subject: Re: Front disks '71 bus

&gt;For what it's worth...my '71 with year old NEW front rotors with 
 the engine running has 1&quot; of movement on the brake pedal before
 resistance is felt.

 You might still have air in the lines...why not bleed the wheels
 again?  How long can it take?  and finally...invest in a one man
 bleeder...you'll use it the rest of your life on every car you own.
