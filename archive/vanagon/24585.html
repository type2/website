Subject: Need a speedo and SORRY

First...SORRY about my last post.  Trying to keep
too many balls in the air at one time as you can see.

Second....
&gt;This is for all of you that frequent the junk yards. I need a
&gt;new odometer/speedometer cluster for my '81 Vanagon. The speedo
&gt;works, but the odometer/tripometer is dead. Sure would like to
&gt;have an odometer/tripometer again, especially since my gas gauge
&gt;is flaky, and I was using the tripometer to keep track of when to
&gt;fill up the van. The only one I could find near Cleveland was
&gt;$250, which sounded high to me. Could one of you guys fix me up
&gt;with one? How much would it cost? Any help would be appreciated

DITTO everything she said except substitute '84 Vanagon and
VW dealer for '81 and Cleveland.  What is wrong with these
speedometer/odometers?  I bought my '84 with 35 miles on it
and kept track of MPG by resetting the trip meter every fill
up.  Now I'm telling miles by gallons of gas.
