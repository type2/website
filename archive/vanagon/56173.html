Subject: Re: wanna van

Seamus,
My name is Kenneth Winter. I have a 1987 Vanagon GL, Weekender,
non-popup, Wolfsburg Edition.  It is metalic Grey in color, with 110k on
it.  Power steering, mirrows and locks are on the van.  It served me
well through college.  I have three VWs and would consider selling my
van if I can find a good home for it.  
Call me at 1-800-264-6757 for more information.
Ask for me directly.
I live one hour North of Knoxville Tennessee.

&gt; I am looking for a vanagon for my younger brother.  He and i
&gt; have been sharing my 86', but now he is moving to connecticut
&gt; next week and wants one for himself.  I would appreciate any
&gt; info on vans in the charlottesville/northern
&gt; virginia/d.c/groton connecticut areas. I have checked the
&gt; classifieds, but nothing really good has turned up yet.  Thanks
&gt; sean for posting the dd.c. classifieds.
&gt; Any help is appreciated.
&gt; thanks in advance
