Subject: BN4:  metering vs diaphragm pump question


HELP!

i'm in the process of buying a BN4 long distance.  i wish to know 
whether it is the more modern one with the metering fuel pump or the 
older style with the diaphragm pump.  could someone tell me how i 
could verbally guide the seller thru this difference in terms of what 
they could describe on the heater they are selling?  i have the Espar 
literature on the metering BN4 so i know what that looks like but i 
have never seen the older style.

please post a copy of your response directly to me as i'm 
signed off the list whilst i prepare my trek to Canada.
