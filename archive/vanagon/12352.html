Subject: Re: List Bumper Sticker?

What a great idea!

YEARS ago, the net.folk on netnews.rec.motorcycles instigated a similar
idea and &quot;geeky' was born!
(Geeky was an ascii graphics deamon &lt;demon&gt; suitably biker-esque while
still being computer related... I.E. ascii graphics made him look pretty
goofy)   He has been described as looking like an owl on acid (!)   :-)

I believe it started out as a patch or pin (to be worn on a motorcycle jacket)
but grew practically into an industry!

Pins. patches. Zippo (TM) lighters license plate brackets, and more , were all
adorned with the &quot;Geeky&quot; logo...

I STILL have my old pin! (though I don't read wreck.motorcycles anymore as
they pretty much are still argueing the same points we were argueing 5 years
ago (!)    (sound familiar?)  ;-)  I'll bet they're still at it today!
&quot; Helmet laws! Helmet laws suck! Harleys!  Harleys suck! YOU suck!&quot;  and so
on and so on and so on...

I vote for an ascii graphic of a breadloaf with some smartass ^h^h^h^h^h^h^h^h
witty saying to follow!   :-P

Buz....

&quot;Don't honk.  I'm pedaling as gfast as I can!&quot;
