Subject: VW repair on the road

Some items I would suggest taking on a long trip in &quot;Old Faithful&quot;:

1.)  AAA Plus membership (100miles free towing)
     I broke down in an old subaru (darn head gaskets) in Williams CA 
which is a really fun place to be.  Luckily it was only about 100miles from 
San Francisco and we had AAA.
2.)  Generator brushes (much easier to replace than the whole generator.)
3.)  Save your old parts when you do a tune-up (plugs, points, cap etc.)


Old Faithful #2 has never actually left me stranded on the road despite many 
thousands of miles of motoring.  Old Faithful #1, my old '67 microbus did 
once. It was the generator.  She has the magical ability to stave off a
breakdown until I get to my destination.  Examples:

1.)  Generator brushes wore out.
2.)  Clutch throwout bearing holder broke.
3.)  Front wheel bearing race welded onto spindle.
4.)  #3 exhaust valve dropped
5.)  Oil cooler broke where it mounts to engine (Where's all that smoke 
coming from?)

If I were to go on a long trip I would bring enough tools to fix any of 
the five problems listed above.  As for special parts,
Old Faithful never breaks down more than five miles from a VW parts 
store.  If she did I would use the AAA Plus card for towing.
