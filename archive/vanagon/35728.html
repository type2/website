I met Jerry Jess at bad camberg - great guy. He's got one of those weird
Fridolins - rare even in Europe. He's got an amazing collection of things
(including &quot;rare' bits gleaned from the dump on NEATos tour of the Brekina toy
factory arranged when they were at Bad camberg! If you collect things he's the
Man! Not sure abiut his collectionof used T shirts tho' :) Dave
