Subject: M Codes and Baywindows

Hi folks,

I just aquired the microfiche for baywindow buses and while perusing it I
found a large M Code directory.  I remember a couple weeks back there was a
discussion about splittie M codes but I don't recall mention of later model
codes.  In my spare time I'd be willing to compile the codes off the
baywindow fiche and make it available if there is an interest.   BTW, if
this list already exists on the web somewhere let me know--I could spend my
spare time doing other bus relating things!
