All,

Yup, the weekly parodies are back! Sorry 'bout the hiatus - it was a rather
busy week/weekend for me. And something else: I've updated the Win95 VW
theme, version 1.1 of which should soon be available in the Fun Stuff
section of www.vanagon_dot_com: the update went out to Ron Lussier as this was
being posted. Enjoy, and keep the feedback coming!

- Jennifer

Fine!  BUT I be a hard core Pry My Mac From My Cold Dead Fingers Kinda Guy.  I
want Mac Version.  I want Mac Version.  I want Mac Version.  I want Mac
Version.

Then I can run it on my 5300 power book and enjoy while the Delorme Mapping
program is running whilst we travel.  I could even hook up the GPS and never
be lost, and still enjoy the VW theme.  But since is't only &quot;Win95&quot; (MAC 1984)
I don't get to enjoy it.    Have I bugged anyone enough yet to do a MAc
version??????
