Subject: Dunlop tires on Vanagon
Date: Mon, 14 Jul 1997 11:03:11 -0500 (EDT)


Since the DPO of my Vanagon chose to put the cheapest no-name
195/75R14 tires on three of the wheels of my '84 Vanagon, and a
studded (!) snow tire on the right rear, I knew I had to change the
tires ASAP. I called my wonderful Cooper Tire dealer (Vreeland Tire in
Parsippany, NJ) who has put tires on my Ford F150 and Saabs, and told him 
I needed four tires.

Since Cooper doesn't make anything appropriate, he recommended Dunlop SP5 LT 
tires, which actually come in the stock 185R14 size. These tires are six 
ply, high pressure, extra load tires, and are great! They run quietly, 
handle well, and are wonderful in the rain. I only saw Michelin and
Yokohama listed on the Vanagon_dot_com page, so you might want to add
these Dunlops to the list of appropriate-for-VWBus tires.
