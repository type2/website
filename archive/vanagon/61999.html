Subject: Dashboard

	I find the dashboard is too cluttered and not precise enough and I would
like to modify it does anyone have any suggestions on how to customize it,
eg. Oil gauge, Gas gauge, Temp gauge and room for CB instead of mounting
underneath, and more colourful lighting, lets bring these babys to the year
2000 technology.

	Serge..
