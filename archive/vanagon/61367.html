&gt; &gt;My wife and I are having a big outdoor party at our house this Saturday.

&gt; &gt;Dogs &amp; burgers on the grill, a couple of kegs, and at least one or two
&gt; &gt;Westies staying over Saturday night (along with their owners).    Starts
&gt; &gt;around 3 pm Saturday, and goes on late into the night (and maybe starts
&gt; &gt;again the next morning depending on how many stay over :)  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Do your neighbours know about this?

No, but they will... :)

(Actually, we're on about three acres of land, so the nearest neighbor
isn't all that close by.)
