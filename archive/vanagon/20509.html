Subject: Vanagon Tires (resolved)/cartoon

Thanks to all who responded to the question that I posed regarding the tire
issue. On Saturday I purchased four Bridgestones size/model: 8ply 185 SR 14
ST D. I tried to get the Yokohamas but couldn't find them and ran out of
time. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. First impressions are that
the Vanagon handles like a sports car, top heaviness and the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;
boat handling over steering appears to be gone. Stablity is much improved. I
feel like I must have been driving with the parking brake on with the old
UFO 14 C load tires. Down side is slight and will take the suggestion
regarding tire pressure to relieve the &quot;Riding like a truck&quot; feeling. The
current ride is a little more &quot;direct to the road.&quot; Over all I think the
change is a positive one. Thanks for the help!! This is a week for Rusty to
lurk. Super busy and looking forward to lots more of that good old &quot;Salary
job&quot; OT.
BTW:Look for the new Rusty VanBondo cartoon to be included in the NEATO
newsletter to be mailed to you later this week/ early next week. Subject?
&quot;Let's do a Resto- (We don't *really* value our marriage do we, dear?) =)
Talk about flame bait! I'm gonna take the phone off the hook during
August!!!! Yowzer!
