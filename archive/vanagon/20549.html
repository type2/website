Subject: Re: Baja Trip - Melling Ranch?



Mike,

The road(s) to the Melling ranch are unpaved, ford a stream when they have to
or branch up across high ground during floods.  None of the grades are steep
and the road is not rough, by Baja standards.  (I've seen a Corvette at the
ranch.)  But it isn't smooth, either :-)

Given the nature of the country, they would never turn anyone away if you
arrived without reservations, although you might have to doss down in the
patio.  Best bet is to write them (they used to have a state-side address, I
think in Chula Vista).  

Nice people.  Quiet country.  Good spot to unwind.

-Bob
