&gt; Did you use a new case?   A pounded case will transfer 20% of engine output

Ack!
	I should have pointed out that this is a type IV case, which is 
aluminum, not magnesium, and does not fatigue.  The bearings fit tightly
in their bores, just like they are supposed to.  I wouldn't have assembled
the engine otherwise.

&gt; Most line bore tools are the bar type and just make begger holes in the case.
&gt;  If the case was so whooped on to start with you have an incorect starting
&gt; point for the machine work.  If the axis of rotation of the crankshaft is not
&gt; in line and angled up correctly to the piston cylinders then that engine will
&gt; never have the output and will always overheat.

I had my machine shop check the bore and they said it didn't need an align
bore.  I trust them, but who knows?  I suppose it's possible they were
wrong...

&gt; That melling while a fine peice of machine work is no good.  The iron
&gt; casting's rate of thermal expansion does not match the Mag-Al alloy of the
&gt; case, so when your engine is warm oil leaks back into the sump from the high
&gt; pressure side.   

I wonder if this is a problem with aluminum cases as well as magnesium?

&gt; 		  It could also suck bubbles of air in on the intake side.
&gt; also the pressure can go way too high with a melling, too much is too much.
&gt;  You could have so much pressure that the stock relief valve will bypass the
&gt; cooler even with a hot engine.

Good point.  But the only reason I went to the melling was because of low
oil pressure before the rebuild (yeah, I was mighty suprised that the
rebuild didn't fix the low oil pressure.  Turns out the pressure dropped
because the motor was overheating!)

&gt; The stock pumps work fine, if you must get one from berg, they are stock but
&gt; the alluminum has been treated (anodized) to make the surface harder/wear
&gt; better. 

I'll do that next time around.  Thanks for all of the feedback, everyone!  :)
