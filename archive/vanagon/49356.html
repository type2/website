Subject: Im' in for it now!!

I just bought a 72 westy from a fella up the street... $900 CDN.  It was 
z-barted and looks to be in fairly decent shape. &lt; At least the rocker 
panels are solid!!&gt;  In fact I bought two for the price of one... the 
other the same vintage, for parts.  The engine is inoperable although it 
is unclear what's wrong.  But hey... he has a pair of motors.

I just thought I'd share this info with all you fine folk on the list...

the great adventure begins, and geeze, I don't know a thing about 
mechanics.  Yipee!!!!
