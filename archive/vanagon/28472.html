Subject: last panamint posting


Thanks Al, for posting all the goodies.  Am packed, ready to
go, and will leave--depending on my caravan participants--sometime
between noonish and dinnerish today.  Around 3-4 cars will be
in this caravan, or all catch up to one another tonight in Yosemite
in lower pines, near curry village.  Anyone else wanting to meet us
there, please do so.  From what Dave Kautz tell me, one goes thru
the reservation clerk there, and it may also be possible to leave
messages at that place.  

If I understand Al's post correctly, we may have trouble with
phone access at Panamint Springs.  I'll bring my cellular in case
to try it.  Because of the doubtfulness of connectivity, however, we
will not have the same nicety of the last trip, where there was a number
for you to call to check on location, timing, etc.   Just SHOW UP, ok?  :)

So, Kautz's, BradleyM, maybe Jeff Schneiter/Argo, and I will be at
Panamint Springs tomorrow (Friday) unless the roads are SO fast we
get there tonight, but not likely we'll drive past Yosemite.  So,
will see the &quot;rest&quot; of you Friday.  Bring neat stuff to burn.  I
think Sarah plans to sacrifice a pair of pants.  :)
