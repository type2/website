&gt;My '80 Westy had this &quot;Fukengruven&quot; bumper sticker - just like the

&gt;took it off!  Now that she's a worldly 6-year old, i wish still had it. Can
&gt;anyone out there tell me where to find one, or does anyone have an extra to
&gt;sell?

I saw a new one the other day... 'Fukenstroken' with the stick figure
experiencing self-pleasure :-).
