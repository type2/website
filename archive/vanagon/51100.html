&gt;Recently two of my OEM Conti's on the '93 MV we have turned up with =
broken
&gt;belts in the tread. I phoned Conti's 800 number (found under General =
TIre
&gt;in 800 information) and complained mildly and they replacedthem free of
&gt;charge with no treadwear considerations (Other than that there had to be
&gt;at least 2/32&quot; left). They claimed that these tires had a 4-year/48,000
&gt;warrantly against all manufacturing defects and road hazards. I've found
&gt;these tires to be good and reliable, but not particularly outstanding.
&gt;The originals were CS-21's; they have now been replaced by CT-22's. My
&gt;new ones handle better than the old ones, have a somewhat softer ride,
&gt;and are rated 240 A A (treadwear, traction, temperature). The CS 21's
&gt;were 200 A B. My tires had 35K miles when replaced.

I just put a set of Contu CT22's on my 93 EV and am pleased
-- especially with the price.  I mail ordered 'em from Tire
Rack and they were $60 apiece.  Shipping and local
mounting/balancing added a total of $61, so my net is $71.25
per tire -- not bad.  I like the performance of them, as
well.  My original Conti CS21's were shot at about 26k, and
I had a set of nonreinforced Uniroyals on for 30k -- OK for
highway driving but lackluster andling performance.
