I replaced the 4&quot; stock Blaupunk door speakers with 4&quot; JBL
performance/competition speakers ($70 made in USA - some non-comp JBL's are
cheaper, less range and power handling, and made in China). They sound
great and handle the power and volume.  They also deliver some really good
bass and exceptionally crisp treble.  I replaced the rear stock speakers
with a new set of Blaupunks, and they pretty much suck.  They're muffled
and have no crispness in them at all.  Now I'll have to find some JBL's
again.

Whatever you replace your stock 4&quot; speakers with be certain to check for
window crank clearance and that the speaker cover doesn't smash into the
side of the dash.  I've seen vans with larger speakers that didn't account
for these differences.
