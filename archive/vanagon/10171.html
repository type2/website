Subject: NW gathering / Say &quot;HI&quot;

Well, hey, I guess I'm a maybe, too. A day-trip would be 
best for me, since I never can tell about my schedule.
I might be able to get away for a weekend, though.

BTW

I'm new to the list (courtesy of Rick Gordon)
so, I guess I should introduce myself instead of eavesdropping on
everyone's conversations...
