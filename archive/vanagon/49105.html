I have a '77 Camper with a unknown year possible new, not rebuilt 
Mexican 1600 engine in it.

I put a new Carb and Distributor on it and it seems to still just lack 
any and all desire to go up any hill.

I am sometimes reduced to 40 MPH on the shallowest of grades.

I have two things.

One is I am not 100% positive the mechanic I had do the work got it 
perfect. He wouldn't have duped me, he's a friend and really a 
mechanic, but not a VW guru. What I am seeing is hesitation and flat 
spots. This is my first Carb car so my first inclination is I am not 
driving right or possibly as I have seen in other threads the timing is 
off. I told him it should be 7.5 BTDC for the 009, like my FLAPS (Bow 
Wow in Seattle) told me.=20

The other thing is I am considering a new engine block. A bigger one 
obviously to help with the hills around here. I haven't tried to 
approach the mountains yet. The '77 had a 2.0L in it and I have seen 
new blocks for under $1000 in the VW Mags. I was hoping to go back to 
at least a 2.0L maybe a little bigger depending on money.

Any suggestions?
