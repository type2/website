Subject: EV Piston Slap Questions

I know that this has been covered before but I need some questions
answered.  Hopefully some of the been there, done that's can help me.
I made an appointment to take my 93 EV to the dealer next week for a
possible piston slap problem.  Symptom is the van sounds like a diesel for
about ten minutes after starting.  My questions are:

Can someone confirm that the head needs to be pulled to confirm or deny
that piston slap exists?  What are the other symptoms of piston slap?  Is
bad compression one of them?  What about the head and pistons indicates
that piston slap is occurring?   What is the typical compression for an EV?

Finally the dealer told me that the 5 year/50K powertrain warranty only
applies to the original owner.  I bought mine used from a dealer so I may
have to hope that the gods look kindly upon me.  I want to have all of my
ducks lined up before I meet with the dealer.

Thanks in advance
