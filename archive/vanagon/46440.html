!!BLINK!!

i just remembered...the other day, when i drove the bus, with the EVIL 40 
horsey in it, and it ddint quite make it..&lt;the rings on 1 shot to shit, 
and took the side of piston with them, and was about to on 4, and welded 
the cylnders &lt;both&gt; the the heads..&gt; say one bus on the way up before 
engine stoped due to the oil blowing in the carb &lt;from crankcase 
breather&gt; and they waved...


then, on the way home, and the enigne finially when to caputeshitnhell 
and wouldnt run no more, TWO VW's passed, me while on side of road. w/ 
hazards on..and a bug behind me w/ oil and bits of engine all over the 
front of it..(friend followed me home to make sure i made it. didnt.) one 
that passed was, get this! A SPLIT! oh! i twas a bit pissed!!! then a 
late 60's bug.

Neither one waved, stoped or anything!!


anyway...

of course, on my way up, i passed a Vanagon on side of road, he was just 
putting the spare on. i honked, waved and began to slow, on I-520, and he 
waved and then waved m on..so i went..he seemed to hae it under control, 
with a old ford minitruck in front, and a 80xs station wagon behind..



anyhow..that  engine...

havent had a car in two months!! sucks.

;excuse weird things. at a friends computer, and i think the dansh just 
kicked in.


odd....

&gt;         To change the subject a bit, Why don't Vanagon drivers wave?
&gt; Whenever I take the '72 camper on a trip, air cooled people wave (and I wave
&gt; too).  When I drive my '82 no one seems to wave, why?  I've tried waveing as
&gt; I go down I-5, people look at me like im a kook or something (please, don't

&gt; 
&gt;         Well, if you see a beat up '82 w/ a lot of antennas in the Siskiyou
&gt; Mts. Wave
&gt; 
&gt;         Oh, a couple of reasons air cooled drivers wave 1.  Its anothee one,
&gt; and it's running too.  2.  Shared pains and sorrows.
&gt;         I have noticed Vanagon drivers will wave in the middle of nowhere
&gt; and on dirt roads.
