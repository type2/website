Subject:      now HERE's a trip!!!

in today's post, i received my little mercedes benz club magazine (yeah,
yeah ... but One Of These Days!!!) and what with all the Red Rock and East
Coast Retry, i thought you might be interested to hear about the trips that
the Idle Rich and Stupid take:

Forty-eight states, ten provinces, three countries ... all in 31,153 miles,
127 days, and a 1995 Mercedes-Benz S320.  this guy buys a brand new $60,000
car and takes off on a four month trip!!!! not only that, but when he changes
the oil, he puts NEW oil and NEW filter, runs it 15 minutes, then changes the
oil and filter AGAIN!!!

now, if this had been a Vanagon Camper or Eurovan Camper or some such, i can
see taking off like that ... but a four-seater car??? sheesh!!!

must be nice.
