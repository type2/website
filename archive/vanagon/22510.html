I have a standard trunk-deck mounted bike rack, we used on the Jetta.  I saw 
one on a Vanagon recently, and after looking at mine, I realized that those 
things are adjustable.  The hooks I used to attach to the front end of the 
trunk deck can attach to the top of the Vanagon back door.  The 90 degree 
(approx.) bracket has pins in it that allow you to adjust it.  And the feet 
that used to stradle the top and rear end of the trunk lid are also 
adjustable, allowing you to open them from a 90 degree configuration to a 
180 degree config.  Take a look at a standard trunk-mounted bike rack, and 
see if you find one that is adjustable.
