Subject: Alignment problems

  I'm having a problem getting a proper alignment on my 85 Westie. 
The casters can't be adjusted because of spread in the tie rods 
apparently. The camber can't be adjusted either and I don't want to 
damage my new yokohama 370s. The guy where I usually have work done 
told me that super beetles have a similar problem but that he had 
never heard of it in a vanagon. Apparently the strut towers get bent 
and need to be brought back into specification. The guy at the 
alignment place said there might be a kit of some kind for bringing 
it back where its supposed to be. Also, my front end seems to be 
higher than in should be, I've been looking at other Westies and they 
don't seem to have the pronounced back end sag that my bus has. Are 
these related problems? Thanks in advance for any advice,
Rick
