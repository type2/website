     GOod Question!  I think mine is on it's way out. It has a small
     vibration at 35MPH only for the first 2 minute of running. After
     that you must stop for 1/2 hour to repeat the vibration. OH This
     is with the drive shaft out. With it in the vibration changes to
     45MPH, all the time.         Eric
