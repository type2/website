Subject: Antenna Mounting

I need to mount an antenna for our celluar phone.  I don't mind making a 
permanent job of it, so holes are OK.  Mag mounts don't seem logical for 
all the obvious reasons.

Any suggestions entertained.  I do need a good antenna, so 
recommendations that don't support a pretty good dB gain antennat will 
miss the mark, I'm afraid.
