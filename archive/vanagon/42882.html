So Mike said:

&gt;In 1949 Volkswagen imported its first cars to the united states.
&gt;That year they sold two cars.
&gt;
&gt;Wow I thought, how would it be to have one of those?  I assume they
&gt;were bugs!  So I would assume either they are wrong or else anything
&gt;49 and back are probably German sold models shipped over here.

Those two cars were shipped to the states by Ben Pon and sold to Max Hoffman
I believe, both were sedans.
