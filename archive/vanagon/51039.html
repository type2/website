:&gt;&gt;Well, all I got was a face full of dried up mouse poop and dirt when I 
:&gt;&gt;investigated the heater hose on my '75 westy. No keys though.
:&gt;&gt;

:&gt;from cleaning up around mouse poop. Seems that inhaling it can result
:
:Ahah!!!! so that's why he wanted us all to look into our heater tubes!
:Roy Robertson secretly wanted all of us type 2 owners who were stupid enough to
:rip our heater hoses apart - to die of mouse poop poisoning!!!!!!!
:
:just kidding, Roy  ya know, a little mouse poop humor.........
:4 days premature.....
