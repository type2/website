Subject:      Re: VAN Tires and Tim's EV Nightmare


I'm still looking for decent replacement tires for my EV. After owning
Goodyears (Invicta) and hearing NET discussions about how wretched
Michelins have become, I am finding I don't have alot of choices for
205-65-15's with a &quot;Reinforced Sidewall.&quot; Now I've heard nothing but
good stuff about Nokian Tires from Finland and even found a dealer in
Wisconsin who will mail them to me (the NRW M+S tire). The only prob-
lem is that these tires do not say &quot;Reinforced&quot; on them. Yet the Nokian
dealer looked up the 93 EV is his handbook and it listed these particular
tires as the right ones. I called two local VW dealers and they both
incanted &quot;Reinforced&quot; several times, &quot;because the tires you have on the
van say that.&quot; The Conti CS 21's I have have 5 plies on the tread and
2 on the sidewall; the Nokians are 4 x 2. So....who do I believe??
Is anything done differently to the sidewall in a reinforced tire??

BTW, the Contis are ok, but nothing special, as far as I can tell.

     My sympathies to Tim Parker for his EV horror story. I have had
none of these problems (knock on plastic) and they sound, as he suggests,
to have much to do with the terrible way VW USA is neglecting the vehicle.
In Europe these vans are everywhere and all dealers know how to service
them. The mechanics here have done ok but I kind of get the feeling they
work on it with one hand in the factory shop manual.

     In short this van is fantastic. It's the best kept (or should I say most
overlooked) secret on the road. Great heat, handling, comfort, space, accelera-
tion. It's the only European van on the market here and it's quality is second
to none. We test drove most of the others. THose who lamented earlier this
fall about the plastic on the newer VW's should check out their chintzy compe-
tition. Type I-III owners take note: if you can find and afford an EV, snap
it up.
