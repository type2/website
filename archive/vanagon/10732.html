&gt; 
&gt; great I have the same problem in my 70 westie
&gt; sam w
&gt; 
Am I the only one out there who reads these tales of gloom and thanks 
the stars that it isn't their ride, only to have the same thing happen
next month?  I pay more and more attention to all you all's wierd 
problems now that I realize my '71 will probably have the same thing 
sooner or later.  Just an observation, back to our regular selves.
