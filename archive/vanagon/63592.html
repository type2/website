Subject: 1975 Bus Owner's Manual FS

Hi all,
The other day I was at the VW dealer and they had a bin of old VW literature.
 One of the items was a 1975 Bus Owner's Manual for $5.00.  I certainly
didn't need one, but thought someone else on the list could benefit from what
I percieve to be a bargain price.  The book is in good condition &amp; for sale
to the first respondee at: $5.00+tax+US postage = $7.00.

Who wants it?
