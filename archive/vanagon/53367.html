Subject: V'gon Hand Brake Cable Q
Date: 20 Dec 96 05:45:28 PST

During my recent brake system repairs (master and rear cylinder 
replacement) I managed to shear off the adjustment end of the main 
cable from the handbrake to the adapter that goes to the rear brakes.

The nut came off cleanly on my parts bus, so I have another cable.

BUT I CAN'T REMOVE THE CABLE FROM EITHER BUS.

I had to dismantle the handbrake lever in the parts bus to get to the 
pin at the end of the cable.  As I tried to pull the cable out, it got 
stuck.  

Peering into the hole left when the handbrake and rubber boot through 
the floor are removed and the I see where the cable is getting stuck.  
There is what appears to be rubber grommet there above the gas tank.  

Bentley says nothing about the cable at all.  
Haynes just says to pull out the cable.

How do I remove the handbrake cable?  
How do I get it through the grommet?

Do I have to drop the gas tank?
(please tell me I don't have to drop the tank)
