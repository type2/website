Subject: EV trans removal

A list member has been having problems in a clutch job on a EV.

The mechanic says that the trans is &quot;stuck&quot; on the engine. I found out that
on the EV there is a pin or bolt that is used to hold the throw-out lever
and release bearing away from the pressure plate to allow for easier removal
of the transmission. They have done this but still no joy. The mechanic says
that there seems to be something else that is holding the trans on the
engine. It moves out about an inch and then will not go any further.

The VW books do not have any other tricks. 

My thought is that maybe the fingers on the pressure plate got really badly
worn out and then the release bearing got pushed into the fingers and now
will not come out. Has any one ever seen this happen?

Please post any help.
