&gt;All you Diesel-Vanagon and Wasserboxer drivers out there, how long after
&gt;you start your engines, does it take for the cooling fan to come on?
&gt;Particularly in springtime weather-- it's around 60 degrees here in San
&gt;Diego where I'm doing this.

	I have an '85 and it takes a while.  I had to wait in a queue
at the state run emissions testing station last fall (40 degree temps)
I kept the engine idling, with an ocassional blip, for 10-15 minutes
and all the guage did was creep up. the fan never came on.  The only
time I can remember the fan comming on was in stop or very slow traffic
in HOT weather.   From a cold start, it would have to idle a long 
time.
