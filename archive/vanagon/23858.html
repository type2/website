         Points-triggered CDI Module Back in Production

In April of 1995 I posted a sermon about the benefits of retro-
fitting an electronic ignition system to early bugs and buses, only
to discover that the capacitance discharge ignition module I had
been installing for more than ten years was no longer available.

With the help of Mr. Keith Gawlik, a subscriber to the Vintage VW
list, I tracked down the manufacturer's address and phone number
(see 'Good News About CDI Modules') and was told the unit would be
back in production in August or September.

I checked with Mrs. Eileen Iles at Universal Corporation on 30
August 1995 and learned the popular 'Baja' model points-triggered
CDI module is back on the shelf, available for immediate delivery. 
The price is $84.95 for the basic 581 model, $89.95 for the more
water-tolerant 'Baja' model.  The price is for single-unit sales
and until the item is returned to the J. C. Whitney catalog you may
purchase directly from Universal (730 Independent Avenue, Grand
Junction, CO 81505, tel (970) 242-5267).  

For those who didn't follow the original thread, installation of a
CDI module, silicone wires and a set of platinum spark plugs will
virtually eliminate ignition problems in an early bug or bus, and
eliminates 90% of your tune-ups as well, since both plugs and
points will last well beyond 25,000 miles.  At the same time, the
improved efficiency of the CDI module should show some improvement
in your fuel economy at highway speeds.  Best of all, if you have
an ignition failure, unlikely with the module from Universal Corp.,
you can return to your stock ignition configuration simply by
reversing the plug in the CDI module.

The original posts are hung out on the 'sermon' page.  A CDI module
is one of the few things you can bolt on to a VW engine that really
does make things better.
