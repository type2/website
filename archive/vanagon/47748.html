   Simple... SOmeone put DOT 3 brake fluid in your system. Vanagons
   require DOT 4.   DOT 4 brake fluid has a higher Boiling point
   (or temperature range). When you got the brakes hot the fluid boils
   which is now air in the lines.. = pedel to the floor.

&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 
&gt; Scenario:
&gt; While coasting down a steepish dirt road carrying a moderate load, 
&gt; braking now and again, trying not to ride the brakes, the pedal suddenly 
&gt; became very soft, and braking power greatly reduced.  This lasted until I 
&gt; reached the bottom of the hill, 3 miles or so.  At the next stop, the 
&gt; brakes seemed fine.  There was an odor burnt something afterward.  Since 
&gt; then, the horrible squealing of the brakes experienced first thing every 
&gt; morning, has vanished.  No other problems for 2 days.  
&gt; 
&gt; What happened?
