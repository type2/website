For those of you interested in tents for you vans, I bought a Eureka tent 
last year for my Eurovan.  It is a Eureka A.V.T ( All vehicle tent ).  It 
is designed for vehicles with a rear hatch.  The tent has a back door with 
a chute around it.  The chute extends over an open rear hatch and allows 
entry into the tent through the back door.

What I do is set up the tent along side my sliding door and pull the chute 
inside, fastening it to the top with bungee cords.  Works great, just have 
to watch your step going in and out.  Just disconnect the chute and you can 
drive away.

The tent is 9'6&quot; x 9'6&quot;, center height of 7'9&quot; and weighs about 25 lbs. It 
is nylon, has a floor and also has a optional screen enclosure for the 
front awning.  It is manufactured by Johnson Camping Inc. in Binghamton, NY

If anyone wants to see it I can email you a picture or two, or send them to 
someone with a web site.
