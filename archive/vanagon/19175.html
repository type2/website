&gt;I'm planning on driving my '77 non-hippie, normal colored, van from here

&gt;old male probably doesn't help... have any of you actually been pulled
&gt;over and serched for drugs?
&gt;Since I'm not the original owner (it is only 4 months younger than me),
&gt;should I worry about someone's stach hidden in the seat cushin or
&gt;something? 
&gt;Or is it stupid to worry about that since I don't use drugs?

I'd rip the interior out, dash and all, tear all the upholstery wide open, 
probably cut open the rocker panels and any other sealed compartments. Check 
the engine sump, inside the valve covers and engine tin. Don't forget the 
tires and battery! Gather up anything that even looks like drugs, then mail 
it to yourself in Tacoma, but get someone else to address the package so it 
won't be in your handwriting. When you get there pretend the package 
couldn't be for you, offer to return it to the postoffice immediately. Drive 
into the countryside, you got lost right, fake an accident, and claim that 
every thing in the van was flung out the windows. Don't forget to break all 
of them as part of the 'accident' Bury the package near the roadside, and 
when things have cooled of a bit, 3-5 years, go back, ingest everything you 
put in the package and ask yourself, why!
