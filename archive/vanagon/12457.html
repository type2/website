Subject: Re: Puddles inside the bus

&gt; It rained last night and when I hopped into the '74 this morning I noticed
&gt; a puddle of water on the floor in front on the passengers side. Window open?
&gt; Nope. Went looking around on the outside and found - Yikes! - RUST UNDER THE
&gt; WINDSHIELD!!

LOL!!!

Sorry, :-), but this describes my bus exactly.  Water runs in from around
the windshield, down the front of the bus behind the dash, and onto the
floor.  The floor is not rusted where it puddles (just a few pits), phew...

Age and the bus, in salty ol' New York... say no more...
