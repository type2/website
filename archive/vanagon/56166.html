Subject: Re: the '82 Diesel Westy Rolls again....

&gt;&gt; One side question:
&gt;&gt; To get at the two other glow plugs, looks like I'll have to remove
&gt;&gt; the Diesel injector pump.  any hints, insight there???
&gt;
&gt;I've done it a few times now - you're right, it's nearly impossible 
&gt;unless you enjoy skinned knuckles and swearing...
&gt;
&gt;Last time I did mine was during a head gasket job, so it was easy. If 
&gt;you do remove the pump, remember the timing should be adjusted 
&gt;afterwards. 
Remove the injector lines to access the no's 1 &amp; 2 glow plugs. It's not
that difficult to restart the engine when you've only removed the lines. We
used to check glow plugs by removing the injectors. This accomplished two
things. We were able to inspect the end of the injector to be sure nothing
was wrong there and clean it while it was out. And then we would check the
glow plugs while installed. You'd be surprised at how many of them would
check good with an ohm meter but when you would look at the brightness of
the glow while glowing there was definitely something wrong with the plug.
Probably on it's last leg. Living where we do if we had any doubt it would
be replaced. Also drained the fuel filter on any diesel that was in for
service. HTH
