&gt;      Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt;        This may seem like an obvious question to most of you but, how is a
&gt;      Westy Weekender different from a Westy.  I have not seen a Weekender
&gt;      in person yet.

Vince,

My understanding is the Weekender is a GL with a fold down back seat
that makes a queen size bed.  It's not a Westy.
