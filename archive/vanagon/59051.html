Subject: Re: Oil Filter

Pfunky_at_aol_dot_com says:

&gt;I've heard that an American V-8 sized oil filter will fit on my t4 &gt;mount, giving me an extra bit of oil, but fer the life of me can't &gt;remember which one Don said it was. Can anyone help? pmail &gt;Pfunky_at_aol_dot_com Thanks. 

I strongly recommend that you don't use anything other than the proper
(preferably German) oil filter on a t4. These filters include an oil
pressure relief system to bypass a clogged filter so as not to starve
the engine of oil in such situations. Your engine doesn't need any extra
oil. In fact, be careful not to overfill the sump or your oil
temperatures will increase 20 to 30 degrees F.
