Subject: 95 EV Camper Prices?

Asking this for a friend who is thinking about purchasing a 95 EV Camper.
The local dealer is 'dealing' on the 95s and one can be had for mid 27K.
Is this a good price?  I  think list is approx 31K?
Question she wants to know - anyone know what a used 95 would cost 
(as a reference to few if any that can be found in the papers here). 
Please email me directly as there isn't any sense flooding the list w/
this.  Thanks.
