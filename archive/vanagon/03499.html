Subject: doughnut spare gas tank

The other day I opened my spare gas tank after driving around and it had
become heated due to the passage of hot radiator air passed it. It sort of
exploded gasoline all over my shirt and pants. This is the round 1 gallon
tank I got from JC Whitney that goes in the spare tire up front.

I am worried that this is not safe and that we need to lay some kind of heat
barrier material over the spare tire to keep the heat away from the tank. Any
ideas?
