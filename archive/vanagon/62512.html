This it too good- I'm going post it on the list.

&gt; &gt; Um, the later, I think. BTW, can you mix the propane with the feon, or
&gt; &gt; do you have to evacuate the feon first?
&gt; 
&gt; In support of your position, I recently came across a letter as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This discussion was hashed out years ago on sci.energy.  Here are some
&gt; &gt; of the points:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  No one disputes that that hydrocarbon refrigerant is explosive when
&gt; &gt;     mixed with air in the proper proportions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  However, it takes a gross leak in an air conditioning system to get
&gt; &gt;     enough hydrocarbon refrigerant into the air to get to an explosive
&gt; &gt;     mixture.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3.  Refrigerant leaks are normally very slow on air conditioning systems.
&gt; &gt;     These leaks are so slow that you won't build up an explosive mixture
&gt; &gt;     either inside the passenger compartment or a closed garage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4.  You can get a fast leak if you are involved in an accident.  But
&gt; &gt;     even if you have a fast leak, you need to have a fairly optimum
&gt; &gt;     mixture of fuel and air to get an explosion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5.  There is enought (flamable) oil in an A/C system that even
&gt; &gt;     a system with only R-12 can have a leak which will burn like a
&gt; &gt;     blow torch, producing chlorine gas in the process.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 6.  If you are talking about a major accident, you need to keep in mind
&gt; &gt;     that you may have 100 lbs of flamable gasoline, 8 lbs of flamable
&gt; &gt;     engine oil, a few pounds of flamable brake fluid, some flamable clutch
&gt; &gt;     fluid, etc.  Cars are rolling bombs, even without any A/C.  A few pounds
&gt; &gt;     of flamable refrigerant may not be a significant additional hazard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 7.  If you do put hydrocarbon refrigerants into your A/C system, clearly
&gt; &gt;     label the system so that someone servicing it knows that hazard which
&gt; &gt;     may exist if the system is opened up (large leak).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 8.  The propane/iso-butane mix is a better refrigerant than R-12, and will
&gt; &gt;     give better cooling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 9.  If you are not comfortable with it, don't do it.  But keep the the
&gt; &gt;     scare stories in perspective.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 10. I believe that pure hydrocarbon refrigerant substitutes are not
&gt; &gt;     &quot;approved&quot; by EPA.  But there is no environmental problem with them.
&gt; &gt;     The EPA is responding to pressure from the automobile A/C servicing
&gt; &gt;     lobby, and imposing regulations outside of their proper area of
&gt; &gt;     concern.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I personally subscribe to the conspiracy theory between Dow Chemical, The EPA,
&gt;  and the Automakers.
