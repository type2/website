Signatures traditionally should be limited to 4 lines, plus a 'separator'
line.  (My sig may be five... I forget.)  Signatures are also intensely
personal, so please remember that it's only my opinion that yours is,
indeed, too cluttered.  You may wish to leave your snail address off.

The pictures are generally stolen or created.  I have one of each.
