Subject: Automatic Choke ?(added info)

As a recap. I own a 76 bus, and the automatic choke is definitely not working
properly. When the engine is off the coil in side the the auto/choke should
be tight so that the flap is closed. However, it is not. In fact it kinda
sits in the middle, not fully open and not fully closed. When you start the
engine it snaps tight for about a second and then resumes its middle
position. What seems stanger still is that when I manually move the coil to
increase the RPM's when warming up, I have to push it in the direction of
uncoiling the coil. Or opening the flap as it is supposed to work. My Dad
suggested that perhaps the coil and flap are somehow reversed, thus uncoiling
it actually shuts the flap. Either way, the coil really does not move in any
direction on its own. Is there any way to fix this? And is it something that
I can tackle myself?

Thanks in advance for any information on this.
Bryce
