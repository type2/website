Subject: Ecu &amp; Idle Stabilizer

FYI,

After hearing about the recall concerning the ECU and Idle Stabilizer, I
contacted VW of America today.  It seems that the original owner had this
service performed early in 1987.  However, the customer rep said that if I
still have a problem with these parts, take the van in to the dealer and have
them check it out.  If they are bad they will pick up the tab.  The dealer
seems a little leary about this.  I told them I want them to check both the
idle stabilizer and the ECU. (I've had a bad idle for some time, can't pass
emissions, have replace just about everything else, and recently smoked the
cat.)  I get the feeling they don't really want to spend the time to &quot;check&quot;
these parts, since it seems they are more into part &quot;swapping&quot;.  However,
 I'm bringing it in next week and will keep you all informed.

Mike
