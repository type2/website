Gentle People (and Ric...)

My wife and I are having a marital dispute, and it involves her front
window in NuBus ('82 Bunker Consumer)...

The problem is that I will not let her roll-down the window, and the
reason is that when she does, the window &quot;disconnects&quot; from the
regulator, and falls down into the door.  

This happens because the small square (~1 inch x 1.5 inch) plastic
piece that attaches the window bracket to the &quot;up-Down&quot; action of the
regulator is broken. When it disconnects, I have to take the door
apart to temporarily re-connect the window to the regulator.

My first solution was to remove the crank-handle from her window. She 
now cannot roll the window down, and the problem seemed to be solved :-)...

Now, Kelly is whining about it being 'hot', and she wants to open the 
window. When I looked at the fiche for the part, the only part is the
entire regulator. I JUST NEED A 25 CENT PLASTIC PIECE!!

So, if anybody has this small plastic piece from an old Vanagon regulator,
I will gladly offer a trade....A fine Convex Computer hat or coffee mug
in exchange. The hat is black, and does not show the grease, which makes
it a perfect addition to the bus-owners wardrobe. 

Humbly,
