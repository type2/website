&gt;It's time to have my 60,000 mile service performed on my '86 Westy. Are
there
&gt;any preventative maintenance things I should have done or checked beyond the
&gt;standard items in the manual?
&gt;
&gt;

Replace water pump or carry spare.  Check all belts and hoses.  Flush brake
fluid.  Change transmission oils and grease CV joints.  Change pwoer steering
fluid also.
