Subject:  Speedometer Noisy

Speedometers with a spring loaded magnet shaft bearing are in
production as of:
   4.90   VIN  25 LH 071 889

Does anyone know a common failure/problem that would cause a speedo to click 
constantly while driving? (needle bounces also) Current mileage 92,000. 
 Should I replace(new/used), or tear into the speedo head?  Are these 
speedos unique to vanagons, or are they the same as in some other VW's?
Thanks,
Pete
