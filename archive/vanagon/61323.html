Subject: Re: VW PARTS AND PRICE FIXING!!


[very interesting and to the point rant deleted]

&gt; believer in the free market system. I will immediately, and with great
&gt; pleasure, file suit for damages against any entity, anywhere in the
&gt; country, who tries on any level to exert influence on the pricing or
&gt; availability of Volkswagen parts to this list or on my website, and will
&gt; also report their attempts to both the Federal Trade Commission and the
&gt; appropriate state authorities.  I know who you are.  Consider this fair
&gt; warning.  Any further attempts, no matter how subtle, will result in swift
&gt; legal action against all parties involved.  Just try me.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, sorry for the rant.  Now back to our regularly scheduled program,
&gt; already in progress ... :)
