&gt;Any other ideas?  Anyone else with like experience?  It's not a normal
&gt;maintenance item to check the bolts, is it?

Yes, it is.  Every time you're under the bus.  And have your next engine
properly balanced.  The engine/tranny interface is a prime nodal junction for
harmonics set up by an improperly balanced engine.  Often times folks buy a
long block, stick on their flywheel and go.  Massive imbalance.
