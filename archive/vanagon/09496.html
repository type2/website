Subject: Leaking Head Gasket

I have an 87 Vanagon Synchro with 49000 miles which
is slowly leaking coolant out the head gaskets.

My local mechanic says that it is head gasket replacement (~$750)
or engine replacement (~$3900).

Any pointers to the accumulated wisdom on the subject?

Any likelihood that VW might 'help' with the problem?

(caveat: I was not too religious about replacing the coolant
every 2 years.)
