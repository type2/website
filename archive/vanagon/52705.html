Amen!  I thought that mine were just difficult to turn and that there was
something wrong with them.  I too would like to know if there is any way to
make them swivel easier.



&gt;I knew about the oil filler extension tube, the stove cover/drainboard, and
&gt;the swivelling front seats.  What I want to know is, where do you store the
&gt;gorilla required to swivel the dang things?!?
