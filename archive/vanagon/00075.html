Subject: Re: getting archive files from vanagon mail list

Jim,
Ok. I think I got this working.
To get the archive so far for April, you'd send the following to
listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

get vanagon vanagon.94.04

I had a vanagon in lower case one place where it needed to be upper case.
next month will be
get vanagon vanagon.94.05
Etc.

Let me know if it doesn't work.
Thanks,
Gerry

&gt; &gt; I get the same response if I use &quot;get listproc/vanagon vanagon.94.04&quot;
&gt; &gt; I just tried &quot;get vanagon 94.04&quot; and got basically the same error.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any ideas?
