&gt;Does anyone know anything about a accessory dual cupholder / knicknack holder

check around in K-mart and Wal-mart and Auto-Zone and places like that. you
probably will have to modify it a bit.

i mounted some on the plastic console panel just in front of the gear shift
lever. you water-cools had better remove the panel first (cause there are
some water pipes behind it and you do NOT want to drill a hole in one!). :)

&gt;&quot;He who has the most cupholders wins&quot;

88 GL with 9 cup holders. do i win??? :)
