Lynne, 

One approach to finding the right place to restore your bus might be
to contact the people who sell the best body replacement panels and see 
if they deal with any commercial outfits in your area (though, if you 
are going to have a full restoration &quot;done&quot;, you might consider anywhere
in the northeast):

Das Bulli Haus
18 Ward Lane
North Franklin, CT, 06254
(203) 642-7242


Good luck,
Tom F.
