Subject: Inuvik Mead request.

That subject line probably doesn't make sense.  I couldn't figure 
out how i wanted to say that i have a request for someone that is 
going to Inuvik.

If someone is willing, i would like to give a few bottles of a
raspberry mead, or honey wine,  for y'all to open when you reach
your destination.  I can't be there in person but i can offer
something that i have made myself.  It is a homespun product from
honey that i produce and berries i've grown.  I would be honored if
a glass was poured in a final destination toast.  

I think mead would be appropriate for this adventure.  It is one of 
the oldest drinks known to humankind and has accompanied the best of 
men and women on their adventures to the unknown.  It is the drink of 
Kings and Queens-- and i know of no other group that so regally fit 
this description.  Toast yourselves, peer up in the sky towards the 
northern lights, then close your eyes and drink....

then let the Pagan rituals begin!
