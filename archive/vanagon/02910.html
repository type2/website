Subject: Re: '84 Vanagon, Help!

&gt;     My '84 Vanagon camper has this problem where every 30,000
&gt;miles or so the head gaskets begin to leak, causing gas buildup in
&gt;the water  cooling system.  This first appears as a rising coolant
&gt;level in the overflow tank next to the oil dipstick. Next the
&gt;dashboard heater quits because it fills with gas.  Finally (about
&gt;2K miles later) the leaking gas literally blows coolant out of most
&gt;of the cooling system and the temperature sensor begins to signal
&gt;imminent meltdown!

I had exactly the same failure mode, but only after 115k miles.

&gt;     This has happened to me three times now.  I travel alot, and
&gt;so have talked to mechanics across the country. They imply it is a
&gt;common problem, that VW doesn't really admit it exists, that there
&gt;has been a service bulletin on it, that the only thing you can do
&gt;is remove the heads and install new seals ($2K!).  

Why $2k?  I had my one head seal job done by the local dealer who cut no 
corners and it was about $900 with tax.  My response is that if it is fixed 
correctly it will last more like 100k miles.  My office colleague with and 
'85 GL got 85k miles.
