&gt;  The mod is to have 2 handbrakes side by side. They can be grabbed
&gt;  together as an emergency/parking brake.


Sam,

I vaguely remember seeing one of these dual handle hand brakes on a 
&quot;VEEP&quot;. Basically it was a modified bug chassis with a pseudo jeep body 
on it. A friend of mine installed these two handbrakes as an after 
market item. It was kind of cool (okay it was dumb), we'd scoot down the 
freeway making lane changes with one brake or the other.

My guess is that it'd work for a bus as well. I'd check in some of the 
off road magazines that have a VW bent to them. Perhaps you'll find one 
there.

Cheers,

Bren
