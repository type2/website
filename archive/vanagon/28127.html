&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hello all.........
&gt;
&gt; When I start my engine after it has sat all night (ie. a cold start) it will
&gt; not stay running unless I keep slight pressure on the gas pedal.  It will
&gt; also stall while idling at a stop light.  This behavior continues until the
&gt; engine has warmed up, then it runs fine.
...
&gt;  -do these symptoms really indicate a bad temp sensor?
&gt;  -did I get the right sensor and am I just blind?
&gt;

The digifant ECUs have a self test built in them, at least for the '88
California Golfs and Jettas. I would suspect the others have the same
firmware with different lookup tables. The Bentley manual details the
set-up and the codes.

Hope it helps, Peter
