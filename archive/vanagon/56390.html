Subject: Itle help please!


Just wondering if anyone would be kind enough to explain how to set my 
itle.  I know that you turn the screw, but thats about all I know.  I'd 
like to check it to see if it's right, and be able to set it myself.  If 
you don't mind explaining it to me then send me an e-mail.  thanks!
