Subject:  help -- easy question :)

Hey all,
Well, I am continuing to see if I can find the cause of my mysterious turn
signal problems on my '78 bus.  

For anyone who has missed it so far, my turn signals and flashers do
not work.  For all practical purposes, the relay is not switching when
either switch is moved to the on position.

So, tonight I chased ground wires down under the dash in an attempt to
find out the cause.  I found out something interesting:  When one of the
ground wires was pulled off of the ground surface, the problem
continued unaffected, i.e. it is doing the same thing as when it is
supposedly grounded.  This leads me to believe that I have a bad ground
somewhere.  

I traced a ground wire to the rear of the instrument panel, which I then
pulled off and proceeded to clean up nicely.  This did not fix the problem. 
Then I traced the wire that's connected to that ground wire over to the
hazard flasher switch.  I cleaned that one up all nice and shiny but still no
luck.  I took off the steering wheel in search of the turn signal switch
ground but found none.  Am I correct in saying that the turn signal switch
grounds through the hazard flasher switch?  The only ground wire that
runs up through the steering column is the ground wire for the headlight
dimmer switch.  And of course, the one for the wiper switch, but that
one doesn't concern me right now.

Are there any grounds I've missed?  I'd like to remove the ground wire
from the relay console to clean it up.  Can I just pull it out or is it
permanently fastened in there?  I couldn't easily get it out when I tried -- it
didn't want to go anywhere.  

Are there any other grounds in the turn signal/hazard flasher system that
I need to attend to?  Looking at the wiring diagram in Bentley I don't see
any and I also didn't see any under the dash.  

Could my bad ground be located elsewhere, like one of the bulb sockets?
It wouldn't be one of the front ones as the parking lights and front side
marker lights still work.  All the bulbs are good.  I know because I've
checked them by plugging them into other sockets where they promptly lit
up.  How would I check the bulb sockets for a bad ground?  I have a
multimeter and a test lamp.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks a lot in advance,
Sean
