I recently saw one in Arizona that currently belongs to Jerry Jess. He had
the vehicle imported from Europe. Although it is pretty rusty he plans on
doing it up right. The front end and the length and overall width looked to
be similar to a squareback, the height and rear of the vehicle looked
similar to a '68 bus. Sliding doors were there too. Funky, very funky!
