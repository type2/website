Subject: Re: Braking for Possum (it's Friday!)

Actually, if you check out the famous &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; they'll tell you to
stop and capture the poor little guy (should be easy if you scare it enough
it'll play dead) then feed it some milk for a week to really tenderize it.
 This apparently makes for some wonderful possum recipes but I've never tried
it and, most likely, never will. 
 Bon appetite.
