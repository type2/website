  Well, I have the type 1 tranny ('70) and a type 4 engine ('78) and it went
  for three years with no problems. Prehaps I was just lucky? 
  
  Yes it did rev pretty high on the motorway, but overall it did slightly
  better mpg than the original 1600 and the bus went up hills far better.

  Anyway, the engine died last summer (pushrod broke) and is still waiting a 
  rebuild :(
