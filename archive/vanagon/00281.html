&gt; &gt; I've got an '85 Westphalia. I've used the refrigerator a lot over the

&gt; &gt; I've had RV places take the frig. out, clean it, blow out the little tube

&gt; &gt; whenever I take it anywhere, which is that it was badly designed in the

&gt; That's strange.  There really isn't much to them.  You must make sure gas is
&gt; getting to the burner.  Is the burner clean.  The burner must have adequate
&gt; oxygen to burn.  Are the vent tubes clean?  The last thing is the igniter.  Is
&gt; is sparking correctly?  

It is strange. I feel like those times where you call software tech 
support and they run you htrough a loop and end up saying it's a hardware 
problem, whereupon you call the hardware tech support and get the reverse.

The refrigerator will startup, run a few minutes to 15 minutes, see a 
light in the little window n the frig. Then it just goes out. It seems 
like gas is getting there. I get it up at the stove too.
