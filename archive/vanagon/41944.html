Subject: ???SAN DIEGO N. CO. EUROVAN SINGLE CAB SIGHTED???

     I was driving home from work this afternoon when I saw what I thought at
first was a
vanagon single cab truck. It was obvious to me as the truck came closer that
this was definately not a vanagon but rather a eurovan. In case anyone else
living nearby in North County has seen this beast, I spotted it in
unincorporated Vista near the outskirts of San Marcos headed east on Buena
Creek Rd. (perhaps an agricultural vehicle?) Anyway, this was unquestionably
a eurovan, but what I would like to know is if this is a factory option for
the U.S. or was this an elaborate hack job? The truck was a grey/beige putty
color and had the customary drop side gates. From the front, the car looked
100% factory with perfect VW detail. Even the back of the cab and rear glass
looked perfect; quite an elaborate peice of work for a hack job on a brand
new car. The rear however looked somewhat less refined having no sheet metal
below the bed save two Rube Goldberg type rear fenders that resembled either
hammered dog shit or something from a high school remedial level metal shop
class project (the choice varying based upon the sensitivity of you the
distinguished reader and the whereabouts from whence you hailed). The bed
itself and the drop gates had a very definative VW appearance. The look of
suprise on my face must have been pretty good because I saw the driver
chuckling at me.

Has anybody else ever seen a vehicle like this or is anyone aware of its
existence? I would be very interested in finding out more about the
availability of such a vehicle. The last I knew was that unreasonably high
trade sanctions against this &quot;commercial&quot; type of vehicle priced this model
out of the reach of most buyers in the U.S. market and that
VWoA had opted to not even try to sell here. My curiosity and I would be most
appreciative if anyone having any information about this vehicle would kindly
choose to pass it along our way. TIA
