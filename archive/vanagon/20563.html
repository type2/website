Hey!

	I ran more CLR and brake fluid thru the lines tonight, along w/compressed
air (125PSI) and got a little more crap out of the lines.

	One interesting tidbit which I have'nt fully interprested is that the
brakes seemed OK until I bled the front ones (when I was all done)
then they started acting funny again!

	I think I should just give up and replace the lines.  I looked at it, and
it doesn't seem to be too difficult of a task after all.  I wonder how they
get those frame-grommets on, tho...

Thom
