Subject: List Stickers

Sorry to bug the list about this...

Can someone tell me the address &amp; info to get a list sticker for our 
new '88 Westy? We're leaving for the Oregon coast &amp; Napa Valley on 
Apr 13, so I'd like to have one, just in case we bump into any crazy 
listmembers.... :)

Thx,
Shawn
