Subject: Re: Wannabus to Gottabus:  How To

I don't know if what I know about buses qualifies as 'skill' but I am
game.  No one would want to buy a bus from the rust belt so this is a
dubious offer at best.  I did offer to look at one recently for
someone but it sold before I got the chance.  I am in Lincoln,
Nebraska.  Dead in the middle of Denver and Chicago, three hours from
KC.  If someone happens to know of a bus around here that needs a
looking over give a yell.  I need all the hippie karma points I can
get.  Jim
