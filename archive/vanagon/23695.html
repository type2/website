I have the same problem. I've taken several vans apart for parts and all of 
them leak from the rotten filler pipes.  I was going to try the following to 
fix the problem.  Get a piece of exhaust pipe with the same OD as the filler 
necks on the pipe and them have it bent to the same shape as the original rubber 
hose but a little shorter at the ends.  To mate the pipe ends together I was 
going to get some of that straight filler hose that you mentioned and put a short 
straight piece on either end to mate it to the existing fuel filler flanges 
and then squeeze them down with hose clamps.  If I couldn't get the muffler 
shop to give me a piece with the correct geometry I was going to get a piece 
of that corrigated pipe and bend it myself.  I would then insert a piece of 
metal pipe in both ends to match the OD of the fuel tank and pipe flanges and 
have it brazed in.  Then use then same rubber hose and hose clap idea to 
install.  I haven't tried it yet but it looks doable at present.

Thanks for the tip about the spring

&gt; Okay, so I got the fuel tank cover off and replaced the hose on my '73. 
&gt; It was a pain, but it had to be done. One problem. As some of you know, 
&gt; you can't get a new fuel filler hose. (Unless someone knows of a source 
&gt; -- I couldn't find any), and so the best second choice is to find a place 
&gt; that has fuel filler hose and buy two feet (at $15 _at_ foot) and then cut 
&gt; off about 7&quot; or so. 
&gt;     The problem is that the original is L-shaped, and when you bend a 
&gt; piece of straight hose, it kinks. Kink your garden hose once and see how 
&gt; much flow you get. So I took the biggest spring I could find, and rigged 
&gt; it with another piece of stiff wire down at the end that had to be kinked 
&gt; on the inside so the hose couldn't close off all the way. 
&gt;     This worked, sorta'. Now when I fill up, the pump nozzle has to be 
&gt; set on the lowest setting or it quites right away from the backflow. 
&gt; Bummer. Takes a while to fill up. Of course, now I can actually fill up, 
&gt; and there are no fumes in the van, and no gas leaking all over the engine 
&gt; compartment from the massive leaks in the rotten hose. But it is slow to 
&gt; fill.
&gt;     Anybody got any fixes for this?
