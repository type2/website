&gt;Okay here's the saga. Throw out bearing goes bad, engine comes out new

&gt;to replace blown one from hooking it up wrong when engine went back in. Car
&gt;starts but won't shift w/ clutch. Engine back out, new pressure plate in,
&gt;engine back in. Car starts, shifts, but generator light comes on.  Terminal
&gt;on generator spins around, loose wire inside and a lot of play in generator
&gt;shaft (bad bearing). Generator out, rebuilt generator in. Battery way low,
&gt;jumpstart - engine cranks slowly. Very old battery - new battery goes in.
&gt;Car cranks for a few seconds then starts - immediately dies. Try cranking
&gt;again, battery acts as if it is severely discharged, car cranks a couple of
&gt;times then stops and clicks. HELP!!!

Sounds to me like you either have your battery connected in reverse, or
the generator polarity is reversed.
                                   
If the battery is installed correctly, take it out and charge it on a
battery charger. Connect a load, say a headlamp bulb across the battery.
Does it work for quite a while?

Battery is OK.

You should be able to repolarize the generator by touching a jumper from
the positive side of the battery terminal to the armature of the
generator for an instant. (NOT LONGER). The momentary surge of field
current through the field winding will polarize the generator correctly.

If a you run a generator in reverse polarity for any length of time,
serious damage can result, including regulator contact damage.
