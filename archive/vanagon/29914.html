Subject: Re: Vanagon lifting,

John,

&gt;OK ignore my last mail, when you said you had raised the rear with
&gt;the plastic inserts, and I got the 2 springs and shock I naturally
&gt;assumed that you had raised the standard coil shaped one and that it was
&gt;the rear.  I figured the syncro had a fully suspened strut independent
&gt;suspension like my syncro quantum had.  Of course it actually has much
&gt;the exact same Vanagon rear suspension coupled to what is little more I
&gt;see now from Bentley than a standard (although beefy) front wheel drive
&gt;car suspension.  Now HOW DID YOU PUT THE RUBBER SEAT UNDER THAT REAR
&gt;ELLIPSE SHAPED PROGRESSIVE SPRING.  I can hardly see how you might have

I added extra rubber seats *over* the rear spring, not under it. I added
several rubber seats above the rear spring with exactly the same part number
as the 1 rear seat over the rear spring the van has in stock configuration.
I did not send you one of the seats for the rear spring as I used them all
raising my van. I believe I have three or four seats per spring now over
each rear spring. As I have raised the rear of the van now successfully I
don't need to alter this setup. It works great. The reason I sent you the
rear spring was merely to get the measurements so that if I make custom
springs later I will know the specs on the stock spring.

&gt;done that sucessfully, as if you supported the outer larger coils you
&gt;lost half the progressive loading nature, not that I don't figure with
&gt;the weight of you Westy the few lower coils are not always in coil bind

The rubber incert that goes over the rear spring is flat, unlike the rubber
spacer I sent you, which is to go over the front spring. Since it is flat
(except for a small molded place for the spring end to sit into) it affects
first the end of the spring, not the outer larger coils. 

&gt;anyway.  I'm figuring in the back a better safer bet would be a couple
&gt;of aluminum spacers that move the whole thing flat up, with a hole in
&gt;the center for the raised bump stop seat.  And on this note does the

Sounds like a nice idea, but the rear setup on my van works well, and so
does not need modification at this time.

&gt;rubber spacer not move the spring above the bump stop seat?  For the

The bump stop seat above the rear spring is something like 2&quot; or 3&quot; long
(about the size and shape of a 1/3rd big coke can)--more than enough to keep
the spring seated even though with my rubber I have moved the spring away
from the vehicle body. 

&gt;front I'm talking to 2 companies about the fully adjustable fully
&gt;threaded shocks as replacements, either this option or secondly a

I cannot believe that any company makes something like this that would fit
my car. If you find something, I will be amazed.

&gt;modified version of the current shock moving down the lower mount that
&gt;clamps over the bottom of the shock and current mounting eye for
&gt;rigidity.  

You mean, something that effectively extends the length of the shock at its
bottom by the desired about (roughly 4.5mm, by the way [1-3/4&quot;]). I imagine
such a thing would look this: 

--at the bottom end it would look like the bottom of the shock does now (a
round tube shock mount) 
--at the top end it would flare up into two metal flanges which would bolt
on either side of the bottom of the shock.

You could imagine this as consisting of two flat pieces of heavy metal about
the same size as your typical VCR remote but half as long, and with holes
drilled in either end 4.5mm apart. You bolt the bottom ends of these metal
pieces into the lower control arm where the shock used to be and then you
spread them out enough so you can bolt the shock into their upper ends. For
stability, you have a round tube of steel on the bottom separating them.
This round piece of steel need not be welded on to them although it could be. 

When we last corresponded, you were concerned that such a setup might not
work because this &quot;lower raisemount,&quot; if I can call it that, might wobble in
its perch, possibly wobbling over to the side. I think such side to side
wobbling could be eliminated by cutting the metal so it fits snugly into the
hole in the lower control arm. I can easily measure the size and shape of
this hole. It bears a similarity to the size of the end of the shock which
it is designed to contain.

Now, I have some concerns about this myself because if this metal piece ever
broke there is a strong possibility the car would go out of control and
crash if it were on the highway. This one metal piece would be supporting
the roughly 1,000+ lbs that comes down the front springs--and much higher
loads over bumps, of course

Secondly, I have the concern you expressed about effectively lengthening the
driveshaft under an unladen condition. Still, the Lower Raisemount seems
like a cool idea, and one I would already adopted if I had figured out how
to engineer it.

An alternative that would raise the vehicle without lengthening the
driveshaft would be to make a piece of metal to go between the front spring
and the flange on the shock. The surface is irregular in that place and so I
wanted to know if you thought such a piece of metal could be fabricated
based on looking at the shock/spring combination I sent you.

Yet another alternative would be to have new springs manufactured based on
specifications I would provide the spring manufacturer. I was planning to
supply specification data based on what you reported to me with your
machines on campus.

&gt;However of critical importance, any idea how much clearance
&gt;between the driveshaft and the shock body?  I'm sad as I had really

The driveshaft passes to a distance of a couple of inches of the lower
portion of the shock as I recall. I can measure the distance tonight.

&gt;wanted to snap up the '87 recently mentioned on the list but Tom got it

I missed this gem entirely.

&gt;before I had a chance as a spare for conversion.  I need to actually see
&gt;one in order to get a better feel for what will work and fit most
&gt;effectively.

Well, perhaps I will send you a bunch of photos of the area from a
collection of photos that I have around here somewhere.

&gt;BTW Derek, did you once have front wheel bearing problems? I think
&gt;you may have but you still had/have your extended warranty, I just
&gt;mention this becasue after looking at things in Bentley if you ever need
&gt;to replace one again I'll lay 10 to 1 odds that you can use the &quot;on the
&gt;car&quot; bearing puller available for FWD VW applications, I can't remember
&gt;the manufacturer but Parts Place rents it, if you ever have need bear it
&gt;in mind, I did the front and rears on the Quantum with the puller which
&gt;likely saved me $1000's of labor.

I never had bearing problems so far but I am intrigued to hear about this
bearing puller. My manual states that the bearing is automatically destroyed
when it is removed from its housing.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Derek,
&gt;Just wanted to keep you informed, got the springs and shock
&gt;lthis past Monday, tested the rear but I now understand you dilema
&gt;on the front, I had no idea it was like this.  I have to make some
&gt;modifications to test it for rate but am going to be able to tinker
&gt;about the university a while after my job starts so I'll get to it in
&gt;mid December if you don't need em back immediately.  Plus I'm

no hurry. I still have to send you postage for the return trip (I'll have
you send em to DC).

&gt;considering ideas on the lift conversion, that rear system is so
&gt;standard a custom fabricated fully threaded model could probably be an
&gt;&quot;off the shelf&quot; type thing, but alas for the front I don't know plus
&gt;from the Bentley can't entirely picture how the front suspension all
&gt;fits together.  I'm also going to note that data we get from the front
&gt;rate won't be totally realistic as by the nature of both varying coil
&gt;and wire size that spring is highly progressive (nonlinear) in rate.

I am guessing from reading this that you got the position of the front and
rear spings reversed. The rear spring is quite separate from the rear shock.
The front shock is shaped like a round cylendar. The rear shock coils become
smaller at either end, so it is shaped more like an elongated pumpkin.

&gt;Of course in the van a few of the coils are supported further changing
&gt;things but the only way I can devise to test is the whole spring, but
&gt;conversely the rate that it will stabilize out to after the &quot;small&quot;
&gt;parts are compressed is probably near correct when in situ.  I also ask
&gt;you this, if a sensible method of raising the thing involved permanently
&gt;modifying a set of shocks would you consider it? 

Sure, I could modify a set of shocks if there were a reason to do it.

&gt;In retrospect I believe
&gt;your spacer on the bottom has the most merit, but has some great
&gt;complexity as something is going to have to be welded to, and the shock
&gt;body isn't likely an option.  Another question, how far shot is the
&gt;shock you sent, seems to really cavitate when you change direction, and
&gt;on this subject, I assume then that these were never gas charged simply
&gt;hydraulic.  Anyway I'll be gettin back to you.

The shock I sent you has about 50,000 miles on it but is installable in my
car if one of my current shocks goes bad.
