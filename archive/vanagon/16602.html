&gt; 
&gt; HELP my heads have been deemed non-rebuildable by a local machinist
&gt; 
  Have heard there are some new welding alloys that may be able to
  save those aluminium heads that were destined to be doomed.
  Can any one who had experience with these new rods elaborate.
  What are the success rate of these welds.
  I believe companies like Eutectic may carry them.
&gt; He is afraid of the dreaded &quot;dropped seat syndrome&quot; and believes at
&gt; least two of the exhaust valve seats must go----  also a couple of
&gt; little cracks there which are no big deal to weld (he says.)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway that place in St Louis says no problem-- for a mere $169 EACH
&gt; they can have me back on the road with all new seats and all new 
&gt; valves and all new guides.  Sounds OK.  New (Brazilian??) heads are
&gt; evidently available for $325  EACH.  Ouch.  

 Maybe they are the guys that 	are using the new alloys.
 
&gt; But to get to the point-  any recommendations on good rebuilders
&gt; or sources for new?  I heard that an article relevant to this 
&gt; topic appeared in the April issue of one of our fave mags-

&gt; anybody read it and care to summarize?  it's already been
&gt; replaced by the may issue.
 Which mag are you referring to?
