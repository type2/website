&lt;&lt; And to all - please state the year of your Type 2/Vanagon/Eurovan when
 presenting a future problem for us to comment/suggest on (Although most
 do, some don't).  It makes life so sweetly simple (and I won't get
 headaches when reading the post &amp; replies).&gt;&gt;

And while I realize it is a rehash of a previous thread, include your
location, too.
A &quot;Cold Start&quot; problem in Chicago would be under vastly different conditions
than a &quot;Cold Start&quot; problem in San Diego.
