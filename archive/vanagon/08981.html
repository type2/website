Hey!  12 of you still haven't signed up to bring goodies.  If you don't,
you can't have any boillibase with garlic, although that will just mean
more for the rest of us.  The biggest disadvantage of all, however, will
be that you have to sit there and drool while the rest of us eat that
bus-shaped cake Mr. Fitzpatrick is slaving away on.  C'mon, enlist!  :

Those refusing to respond, will be put in charge of:

lavatory cleaning (and with this group, that could be SOME chore)
group leader assistant to Jeff for nite hike looking for wood-elves
saxophone patrol at the hootenany
cleanup crew at the oil change seminars.

Hop to it!
