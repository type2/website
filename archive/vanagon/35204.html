	That's kinetic, not potential. :)  When you suspend the 'roo bar
from a great height, preparing to drop it on the head of the person fancying
installing it on a SUV, *then* the bar has lots of potential energy.

	Well put, Andy!  I saw a sparkling-clean brand new Land Rover the
other day (parked downtown doing some shopping, naturally...) and the
monster 'roo bars on the front of it had peeling paint &amp; tons o' rust
poking out.  Must have sustained damage during one of those crazy holiday
shopping sprees. :-P

	My wife has found that the squareback's front bumper adequately
protects her from road signs and parked Toyotas.  She's not yet tried it
out on livestock of any kind. :-O ;-)
