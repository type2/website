Subject: Solar cell trickle chargers

My brother parks his car for weeks at a time, in an outdoor parking lot
at school. He has been having trouble starting it recently, 
sue to bitter cold and a slightly discharged battery.

Has anybody been using a dashboard-type solar cell trickle charger?

I have seen them at JC Whipme, but I was wondering if there was
anybody more (ahem..) respectable that you dooodz could reccomend.

I was hoping for something that is cheap (less than $50), enough
to keep a good battery from croaking, and can be removed when driving.
