Subject: PNW Gathering of the Vans?


Well, the holidays are over, the weather still sucks, but the days are
getting longer here in the great Northwest. And there is another school
holiday coming up the Monday after next weekend - Mr. Kings birthday.
Anyone interested in using this 3-day weekend for a local gathering/party?
I'm still thinking of going out to the coast, but I'd consider Deception
Pass too. More hiking at the coast - maybe head down to the Hoh for a day
if the NPS reopens by then! A longer drive though.

I'll bring the new van so you can all rag me about having heat &amp; room to
move around in. (As long as I get to rag you about the number of spare
parts you're carrying!)

Next 3-day weekend for us happens mid-February. Presidents day or something
like that.
