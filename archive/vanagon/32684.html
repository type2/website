&gt; &gt;ok. since it's friday, i'll ask:
&gt; &gt;why is the gesture of the extended middle digit called &quot;the bird&quot;???
&gt; &gt;doesn't LOOK like any bird i ever saw.  you ever see a bird that looked like
&gt; &gt;that? not me. anybody ever heard anything about the derivation of that name?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Excellent question!  Originally the &quot;bird&quot; flip (originated in Italy in the
&gt; late 1500s) consisted of the thumb, pinkee, and index finger, thus
&gt; resembling a bird's &quot;foot&quot; and hence the name.  As generations used and
&gt; reused this great tradition various derivations arose, leading to much
&gt; confusion, especially among fellow bird watchers and early orinthologist
&gt; clubs.  In late October, 1788, a select group of European diplomats gathered
&gt; in Paris to universalize this profound expression of anger.  After much
&gt; bickering between the Italian and German delegates a physical fight ensued
&gt; between Alfredo Romeo and Gustov Grundig which resulted in Grundig cutting
&gt; off all of Romeo's fingers except the middle.   The gathering was postponed
&gt; till later the next year, but events in Paris prohibited a second meeting.
&gt; So that's how the modern usage of the middle finger came about.
