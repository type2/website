Jesse,

Sorry for the bad info and any trouble that I might have caused(I'm just
another crack pot on the list), The voltage I really measured was  .55
volts (approx. half a volt dc), not 5.5(five and a half), I hope this
didn't make a bunch of people go out and measure the O2 sensor voltage.

I have used the same fluke digital meter for 8 years now and can't think
why I was seeing 5.5 volts.

all the other stuff was true, promise.

&gt; Jesse,
&gt;
&gt; On my 86 water-cooled I was having very similar problems, the o2 sensor
was
&gt; the culprit, your symptoms would show up in the winter and when ever the
&gt; van was driven in the rain, I finally got out the squirt bottle after
&gt; various suggestions from fellow list members and doused all the wiring
&gt; hoping to see the light show. It was relayed to me that if any ignition
&gt; wires were bad then they would short to ground when wet, no luck on the
&gt; simulation. Until I sprayed the top of my o2 sensor, then the van idled
&gt; lousy, but upon start up would be semi normal until the o2 sensor dried
&gt; out,  then normal. the sensor is an after market one that was recommended
&gt; to me, doesn't have the heater wires, yours may be a single wire design
&gt; compared to a three wire design. To check the effect of the o2 sensor, I
&gt; connected my + lead on the volt meter to the sensor connection (when the
&gt; van is turned off) still connected, the neg. lead goes to  a grounded
spot
&gt; anywhere. the results are:
&gt; van running at idle approx. 5.5 volts dc(varying up and down a bit, less
&gt; than 1 volt), spray the top of the o2 sensor and got water inside, =drop
to
&gt; less than one volt, van running rough. I found that if the voltage was
&gt; below 4.2 vdc then the van would idle really rough, as the water dried
the
&gt; voltage would rise, letting me know that it responded to temperature and
&gt; water.
&gt;
&gt; I cannot vouch for the correct voltage measurement, cause I don't have
that
&gt; factory $265.00(can) o2 sensor.
&gt;
&gt; this all might not be your problem, but my eyes were opened to the need
for
&gt; a working o2 sensor.
&gt;
&gt; just my o2cents worth

&gt; &gt;&gt; Cold starts are fine
&gt; &gt; idles erratically if left idling for a few minutes, eventually stalls
&gt; &gt; drives fine at highway speeds
&gt; &gt; stalls when slowing down to a stop
&gt; &gt; won't start right away after stall
&gt; &gt; will start when left to sit a few minutes
&gt;
