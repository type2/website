Subject: talk me outta this...

I am *this* close to putting my Westy up for sale.

This afternoon, it sits in my driveway, dead, once again!

It's got maybe 200 miles on the engine.  This morning, I was headed up
Oak Creek Canyon to work, and the rat-a-tat noise I've been whining
about for the last 3 months started fading away, until I actually could
not hear it over the wind noise (a very nice day in the canyon!).  Man,
I was happy!  I figured whatever it was must have wore itself down to
the point where it didn't make any more noise.  I was going to check
the oil at work for any metal pieces/shavings, then I was sure to be
home free!  BUT, as I started down shifting to start the climb out of
the canyon to the rim above, the noise suddenly returned with a vengence!
Clackety-clackety-clack!  I zipped into a turnout and turned the key off,
and as it wound down, I could hear a sound like that of two gears trying
to mesh unsuccesfully (like when you accidently shift into reverse at 40mph;
'cmon, you know what I mean!).  I got out and popped off one valve cover,
and while turning the crank with a wrench, I see NO valve train movement!!
It appears that the crank no longer turns the cam.  Broken cam gear?
Broken cam?  I don't know.  Maybe I don't even want to know.  For the
right price, I could easily be persuaded to join the ranks of the 
bus wanna-be's!

For this week only, members of this list could get a very clean, '71
pop-top Westfalia, with a new (refurbished) top, new canvas, new tires,
not much rust (CA car, don't ya know), new non-running engine (FWIW),
for say, $1300.

DON'T make me an offer!!!

As it turns out, there may be a ray of hope for me yet.  A guy I work
with, who lives in D.C., has a 'new' engine (in pieces) out of a bus
that he's going to *give* to me!  I don't know much about it beyond
that, but for the price, I'm not asking!
