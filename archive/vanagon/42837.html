Subject: 3rd. Bug in Penuelas Puerto Rico

Next Sunday start the season for VW shows in Puerto Rico. This time everybody
is going to the south of the island, to the town of Penuelas famous for the 
huge amount of buggies (of course the beach is about 10 minutes from that
place). We will see and admire the last restoration projects and meet old
good friends. This is a day where you can take the family and have a lot of
fun ( nice cold b...s). We are planning a caravan from San Juan to cross the 
island. I have friend that will travel in a cherry 62 Crewcab and of course
I will take my lovely 78 Westy.  I wish you guys could enjoy this trip with
us (to far ah).
Peace to all,

Angel
78 Caribbean Westy
85 EcoVanagon GL..
