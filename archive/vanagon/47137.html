Subject: Re: That '87 for sale in Los Banos

&gt;He's asking $7900, and the place is called &quot;Foreign Auto&quot; in Los Banos.
&gt;The owner (Steve?) was real nice.

Westfalia Weekender??  If this has a poptop, rear bed/bench and two rear 
facing single seats it's a Multivan. Excellent choice, all the Westy stuff 
you need without the price!! Add a full kitchen later if you happen upon a 
deal. $7900 seems a bit high those repairs total $500 +/-.


&gt;find and examine a TriStar...

hah, take a camera please if you find one, preferably a video camera and 
lights and shoot every corner of the undersides.  They have extra gussets, 
welding etc.

&gt;
&gt;Does anybody out there know if there were any Single-cab Syncros ever
&gt;produced for Canada?  Any of you Canadians ever see any single-cabs

I think they were, read a review of an Australian one, but never seen any of 
the 'transporters' (panels/crews/singles) in Syncro trim.  Haven't seen many 
single cabs now you mention it.  Owasco VW in Whitby Ontario was/is? the 
biggest vanagon/Eurovan etc. dealer in Canada.  Ask them, or phone VW Canada 
in Scarborough Ontario.  Both are very near Toronto (area code 416)   tim
