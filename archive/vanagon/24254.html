Subject: Re: Info Wanted: '66 Bus Cargo Floors

     John,
     
     &gt;To me, it doesn't look too serious.  However, I do need to buy two 
     &gt;new floor sections (about $220.00 from Wolfsburg West).
     
     wow, $220!!! the repair sections (the corregated sheets) should only 
     cost about $25 each max!
     
     &gt;How hard/expensive will this job be?  I do not have any welding 
     &gt;experience and will have to pay someone else to do it.  Should I find 
     &gt;a VW shoppe that can handle it or can a welding shoppe do a decent 
     &gt;job?
     
     if the rockers are ok, then it's simply a matter of cutting a 
     rectangle out of the floor to remove the rust, cutting the repair 
     panel to fit your new hole and welding it in.
     
     any auto shop should be able to cope with this knid of job.
     
     Lee.
