Subject: Re: 87 syncro found - help

OK, best I've seen was '87 Syncro for $2500US with heads shot and removed, a
tow-away, in good shape, one owner, 85K miles, new exhaust, brakes and 4 CVs
You figure it out.  A rebuilt 2.1 will run you $3200 at least since you
don't have a core (ie$600 trade-in) So at least $3200 + labour.  Finding a
good junkyard one used would be wiser.  
        How about considering an Audi 5cyl 130HP transplant? Several
interested parties would be just itching to try this on a Syncro, me
included &lt;g&gt;.  We may be induced to contribute somehow, (moral support and
beer?)  Tim Smith
