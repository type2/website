3M makes some good stuff that comes in a red tube.  It was purchased at 
my local auto parts store.

&gt;         Just curious as to wether or not anyone has ever taken the rubber
&gt; trim off their pop top and re-glued or adhered it? I dont want to have to
&gt; buy a new rubber strip, and its in great condition, but the glue is drying
&gt; and crack and making the rubber peel in places.
&gt;         If anyone could suggest a glue to use or has any tips Id love to
&gt; hear em. As usual. :)
&gt; 
&gt; BTW my van is running ok now...seems fine, although I would really like
&gt; some gauges to help me out. As soon as I get that Bentley Im going to work!
