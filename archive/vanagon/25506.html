Subject: Rebuilding 74 Westy


I have recently bought a 1974 VW Westy 1800cc. It is my fist VW. I have
rebuilt other engines in the past, but the VW engine is a little
different than all the ones a have rebuilt.  I am rebuilding it so that
me and four of my friends can take it to California this summer.  Being
that I live in Gainesville, Fl. this will be quite a trek. I am looking
for a reliable mail order catalog, but I have not found one that
specializes in Westy's. I need everything from engine parts to seat
cushions. Any recommendations from all of you VW veterans out there about
rebuilding procedures, hints for on road locations to stop on the way, or
anything else would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Woody
