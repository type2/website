Subject:      Syncro ride height data collecting...

Hello Listees.   It was pointed out to me that the place to measure
from isn't that clear in my previous note.  I'd like to add to
Derek's definition that the measurements should be taken to the
wheelwell lip as this is a constant part of the body without ridges,
and is pretty much inline with the axles.  This is the part of the
body that folds under into the wheelwell.

 &quot;The measurement is taken by measuring the distance between the
 wheelwell (lip)  and the center of the wheel.&quot;

 I just measured to the centre of my hubcaps.

  right front   46.5 cm (this measurement is correct!)
  right rear    45.5 cm

  left front      45.0 cm
  left rear       45.0 cm

  Our van is currently loaded for camping with full propane, food,
 and full tank of fuel.    Just missing us, water, and some clothing,
 and fresh foods.

Thanks again, folks!
Harry.
