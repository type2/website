Scott,
Congratulations on your brilliant choice of Vanagons.  I too bought an
86 syncro GL a few weeks ago.  I posted the same question a couple of
weeks ago, and got a great reply from Joel Walker on this list.

Here is his reply:
&lt;it's called &quot;Insert for Owner's Manual: 1986 Vanagon/Transporter,
Syncro Model&quot;. in english. :) printed 4.86, part number 000.5608.14.23

check with these folks. if it's still available (and it should be ...
they still have 1975 manuals!), they should have it.

Out-of-Print Service/Owners Manuals
Volkswagen United States if it's still available, they'll send
it to you. $10 each.  1-800-544-8021&gt;

I called this number and was told that one would be sent AT NO CHARGE
within a couple of weeks!! It has yet to arrive... but I have high
hopes.

Thanks again Joel
