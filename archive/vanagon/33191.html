Subject: Batteries: snowdrift plus adding a 2nd...

Hi Folks

I'm looking for some help if anyone's experienced the sort of thing I've
got going on now in my '77 breadloaf Westy...

We had some serious snow here this winter (NJ), and when I opened my
engine compartment, I've got a pile of snow about 6&quot; high sitting right
on my battery!  It blew in from the cooling vent on the right rear side
of the bus.

Needless to say, I'm not interested in trying to start it like this.
In fact, I'm replacing my battery over the weekend - the battery in
there now is a no-name and I want a heavy-duty Die-Hard or Interstate.
Before I buy the new battery, I'm looking for suggestions for keeping
the snow off the top of my battery.

I'm also looking for suggestions on connecting the second battery - the
PO had removed all traces of it...  If anyone has a Westy 2nd battery
wiring diagram, it'd be a big help!

Please reply or at least Cc: me via direct email, as I'm on DIGEST mode.

	Thanks a million!

		Jay
