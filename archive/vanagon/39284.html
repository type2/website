&gt;On school buses....Claraw_at_aol_dot_com, you mentioned you saw a school bus
&gt;with a VW Bus welded on top?  What show did you see that at?

When I lived in Ft. Collins, CO many years ago, there was a guy with a
splittie, don't know what year, who had the front ten feet or so of a Lear
jet fuselage grafted onto the top. I never looked inside, but I assume the
bus top was open so that you could stand up inside the bus and look out
through the Lear's windows. Otherwise, why would he...

Now *that* looked weird.
