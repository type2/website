&gt;Here's what we do:

&gt;10 cup perker, try less if smaller), then fold each corner of the paper 
&gt;towel over the &quot;spike&quot; in the center, punching a hole in each corner so 
&gt;the whole package lays flat in the basket.

Jack,

What does the paper towel do?  I assume just make it easier to clean.
