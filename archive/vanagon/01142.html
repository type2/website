Subject: propane or electric?


I've got a '66 Westphalia, and I want to replace the block-ice 
refrigerator with either a propane or DC unit.  Both types of units seem 
to cost the same amount of $$$.  I hope some of you might opine on which 
setup is superior.  Three questions weighing heavily on my mind right now 
are:
1) How many hours of use can one expect from a 20lb. propane tank, or a 
charged deep-cycle battery?  (oh, and what is the going rate for propane?)
2) Is it feasible to use one of those small camp-sized propane heaters as 
a supplemental heater during those excursions taken in cooler climes?  
3) What additional components are required (besides a deep-cycle battery) 
to create a functional power supply, and is it feasible to self-install 
them?

I'm going to decide one way or the other by Tuesday, so any info before 
then is appreciated.

BTW, the boneyard at Austin Veedub is first-rate... where one has the added 
benefit of watching F-16's zoom overhead at 200' as they perform 
touch-and-go's at Bergstrom AFB.
