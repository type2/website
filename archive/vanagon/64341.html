Subject:      Setting fuel mixture

I was wondering how to set my fuel mixture on my air-cooled vanagon? Do you
turn the screw clockwise to lean up the mixture or counter clockwise? I dont
have arrangements to set it using any computerized means, so I must adjust
and measure the results by driving the vehicle,and re-adjusting again until
the proper &quot;feel&quot; is achieved. The mixture screw is located on the AFM unit
itself. I am unfamilliar with the later model water-cooled vanagons and am
not sure they are set up the same way. I had a shop set my timing, and they
told me they could'nt continue as my AFM was &quot;dead&quot;. I had a freind test it
and it is &quot;live&quot;. Is this shop trying to rip me off? That is why I do not
trust local shops here in AZ.

Please send to me directly, as I'm not currently a subscriber.
