Subject: Re: Idiot factor

I once towed a $150 junk Bus with my (former) *very* nice '77 Bus with a 
chain looped around the (flimsy) rear bumper.  After lurching all the way 
home my bumper was pulled out in the middle and two softball sized dents 
were made by the ends of the bumper into the body at the lower rear 
corners.  Just great... a $150 Bus and $300 damage to my good one.  I 
have since bought a tow dolly.  I'm still and Idiot, just not as often. :-)
