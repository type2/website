I waffled:
&gt;&gt;My fuel consumption was 38.5mpg, with about 50 miles of city 
&gt;&gt;driving included.  (can't wait to read the replies to 
*that*!)

... then Joachim joined in a verse ...

&gt;P.J.,
&gt;would that g in mpg be Imperial or US...?   ;^)

&lt;evil cackles escape from the Bushrat, happily hunched over the 
keyboard&gt;

Heh heh heh. I *knew* someone would ask about that.  It's 
imperial.  Bigger gallons.  (heh heh heh, again.)  I don't know 
the conversion rate to US gallons, but it is 7.34 litres/100 
kilometres.  Yes, 1991 was an excellent year ...  :)

&gt;Joachim
&gt;'90 GL (gas/essence/Benzin/petrol and definitely not 
&gt;38.5mpg, Imperial or US or otherwise)

&lt;with a last twisted chuckle, the Bushrat presses the SEND 
button&gt;
