&gt;Where&quot;s the radiator bleeder located on the radiator of my 82 diesel vanagon??
Top of the radiator, behind grille, passenger side. Could be a 13mm headed
bolt with a cut down the side to allow air and coolant to escape without
completely removing the bolt. Or a bleeder that looks exactly like a brake
bleeder, it is one.
&gt;Can i use a oil cooler off a gas gti/gl jetta to replace my leaking cooler??
If the hose line up propery you can use it.
&gt;thanks for the much needed help????
