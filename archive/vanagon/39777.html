&gt;
&gt; I have a feeling that my  steering 
&gt;box is on the outs.  If anyone has any ideas on 
rebuilds/solutions, or one sitting in 
&gt;the shed, please let me know.
&gt;Thanks.

I have a good steering box from a '76.  I'm not sure if it is the 
same as a '72.  Maybe someone on the list can tell us.
