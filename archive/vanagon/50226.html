Subject: Re: Car jack or axl stand

Clarification requested:

Use a jack stand ---  car jack? or &quot;axl&quot; stand?  ;-)  I assume you mean
axl stand.  

For me, I've had a personal tragedy re: a friend whose van (GMC
behemoth) fell on him, killing him.  Since then, the only time I'll go
under a car is... almost never...  When I do go under a car, I first use
the emergency/car jack, then I support it with $15.00 pair ($15.00 for
both) of 3-ton stands  that I think I bought from a Costco or Price
Club.  Hopefully three stands are better than one :)

Yup, sometimes I think _I'm_ paranoid, but then I remember my friend who
died trying to save exactly $8 dollars by doing an oil change himself.

Just something to think about...

&gt;&gt; One quick question.  I'm slowly building my collection of tools.  As
I go to
&gt;&gt; check for wheel bearing problems tonight, is it safe to put the van
up on
&gt;&gt; the car jack while I work on it, or do I need to get an axl stand?
BTW, is
&gt;&gt; axl the correct spelling?  What an odd looking word.
&gt;
&gt;Tim,
&gt;
&gt;Use a jack stand, it's much safer, place it under the frame. 
&gt;
&gt;Also, axle has the e on the end (I had to look it up to make sure)
