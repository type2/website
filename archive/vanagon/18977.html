&gt; reassembly), a new circlip, 90 grams of CV joint lubricant, and a
&gt; new boot clamp.  J.C.Whitney's kits are from Meistersatz, the
&gt; German company that supplies VW with your original boots.

A great sermon Bob but are you sure on this fact?, last time
I ordered a boot from Whitless, admitedly 6-7 years ago it
was a real piece of shit, now I know that some of there stuff
is much better quality recently but I personally won't take
the chance on boots.  Flip side though, front discs for the '76 were 
OEM Cofab as were their HD shocks last year which impressed me.
I get my boots from a local import supplier and they are
very nice quality though not OEM, have had a set on my aunt's
'78 Rabbit for 7 or 8 years so I keep using them.

Just a thought.
