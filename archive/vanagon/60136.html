&gt;I'm going to PA this Saturday after I help my Dad rig his new yacht
&gt;(yaught) ...whatever.  I'll take the Syncro (if it's still for sale) for
&gt;a test drive and inspect it.  I'll post all the findings Monday night
&gt;when I get back.
&gt;
&gt;It's an '87, 103,000 miles, cream with tan and grey &quot;4WD&quot; graphics and a
&gt;cloth tan interior, alloy wheels, new rubber, diff. lock,  $6000 asking
&gt;price.
I stopped by and saw it on Friday, although no one was there.

Looks nice, interior nice (brown/tan interior--not the real light 
tan/beige, a more medium color) no visible damage inside or outside, 
exterior nice with &quot;Synchro&quot; pinstriping. Nice alloy wheels!

BUT:
1) oil sludge/film (not thick) on the bottom (back bottom, where the 
muffler is) of the engine(may not be a problem, oil level was fine, this 
is probably from crankcase vent)
and
2) coolant tank was empty :-(  (this is the license plate tank--I 
couldn't see the other one). I didn't see any coolant stains on the 
heads, though. maybe it's just a leak in a hose or the radiator, or just 
time to fill it, but the tank was dry--I looked inside.

Sorry, no one was there so I couldn't start it up or look further at the 
engine. But I live only a mile form this place, and I pass it every day 
on the way home, so I should be able to catch someone there. They don't 
keep very regular hours...
