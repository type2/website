&gt;&gt;It has always seemed to me that &quot;just&quot; leaving the car in gear on a hill

&gt;Having seen a bus that went over an embankment after the seemingly good 
&gt;parking brake let go just enough to let it roll, I don't really care what 
&gt;long run damage may happen.  If I'm on a steep hill, I'll risk the 
&gt;long-term damage in order to avoid the short-term damage of my VW hitting a 
&gt;wall!

I think that the point is to use both.  And in San Francisco, you need to
curb your wheels by law.
