Subject: Re: oxygen sensor test

Now I could be wrong (rather easily), but from what I recall reading the
archives and such, the computer is suppose to ignore signals out of
range as being 'bad' from the O2 sensor.  I believe that 0v AND 1.5v are
both out of range.  Thus, the computer was SUPPOSE to ignore them and
continue to behave the way it was.  If I recall correctly (it's been a
number of months since I read it), the signals from the O2 sensor are
suppose to be in the neighborhood of .4 to .6 volts.  My memory is a
little foggy on this, so maybe you ought to check the info for yourself.
