Subject: Second Battery Charging....kinda long

All,

After reading the article in the archives about second batteries, and
charging them, I have a few questions, which I am sure were answered a
few months back, but at the time I did not have these questions, so I
did not pay too much attention to them :-(.

I will be using an isolator system for charging the batteries, as they
appear to be the easiest for a relative novice such as my self.  There
were 2 types of isolator arrangements, the first being an &quot;active&quot;
isolator, and the second being &quot;passive&quot;(?) isolator.

The active isolator(for those who don't know) has the alternator hooked
up to the secondary battery, with a relay running to the primary battery
to allow charging when necessary. With this system there is a (according
to the article) 0.3v-0.5v drop accross the relay that cannot be
compensated for.  What effect will this have on the charging of the
primary, will it charge slower, or will it not charge completely?

The other (passive?) isolator setup is a separate lead running to the
spare battery with a relay on the second lead. This has a 0.8v drop
which can be compensated for by attaching the voltage regulator on the
other side of the relay, thereby fooling the alternator into putting out
the extra voltage required.  I have a 79 Westy, and unless I am mistaken
the voltage regulator is built into the alt.  So how would I compensate
for the voltage drop here.

The reason for these questions is that I have the Deluxe Campmobile, and
one of the &quot;extra&quot; features of the Deluxe is that the spare battery can
only be charged from shore power, through this great little panel above
the fridge, and if I plan on camping in the sticks for more than 2 days,
the battery will be drained with no means of recharging it.  What I want
is to maintain the ability to charge from shore power, as well as from
the alt. when running.

I believe there was a company mentioned that specialized in this sort of
equipment, but in a fit of house cleaning, I purged the message, if
there was such a company mentioned, would you kindly forward the info.

Cheers,

David
