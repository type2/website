&gt;      I'm a tad upset about having some jerk glued to my rear
&gt;      bumper AND I STAND ON THE F*****G BRAKES!!! Then give
&gt;      them a nice smile and wave, knowing that they've soiled
&gt;      their shorts in fear of running into me.
&gt; 
This is the trick I learned from my drivers ed. instructer (In Clovis, New
Mexico even)  Instead of actually stomping on the brakes, I let off the
gas and turn on my hazards.  Idea is that tailgating asshole will suddenly
believe that (with my sudden decrese in speed and apperance of tailigts)
that I actually &quot;STOMPED ON THE FU#$$^%&amp;_at_ BRAKES&quot;  Tailgater either panic
brakes are kisses ass good bye.  Moral of story:  Local law enforcement
type witness event and wants to pull me over for dangerous stunts on
highway-I smile innocently as I explain that i never hit the BRAKES, I
just turned on my hazards (which are still blinking) because I was
concerned that the guy fast approaching from the rear couldn't see me...  

&gt;I'm in the market for a bumper sticker advising tailgaters that          
&gt; tailgating will not make my car go any faster...

add to it another bumpersticker pointing out that it takes a real stud to
pass a VW camper, you stock car stud you.
