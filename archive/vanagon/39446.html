Subject: AAA info request..



My advice would be to boycot the AAA.  I was a member for a few years
when I had a 76 bus too old for my insurance to give me towing cover.  Now
I have  nice &quot;new&quot; 84 westfalia I have had the pleasure of dropping my 
membership.  IMHO the AAA is a backwards anti-environmental pro-gas guzzling
pressure group.  They are against any increases in auto related Tax that
might actualy force us to pay the true environmental costs related to driving.
They actively oppose the use of public money to fund alternative transport. As
a dedicated auto user I do not feel that they represent my interests.  Read
their newsletter if you doubt me.  I complained about their policies several
times but of course did not get satisfactory answers.  They are very usefull
but I am glad not to have to be a member!
