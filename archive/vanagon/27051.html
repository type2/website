 &gt; &gt; Yes, it's attractive, but what I worry about is that when I draw a bead 
with 
 &gt; &gt; the paint gun the target (who's a jerk or I wouldn't be doing this) hauls 
the 
 &gt; &gt; .357 out from under his seat and lets me have it.
 &gt; 
 &gt; That's silly. No self-respecting carrier of a firearm would place it that
 &gt; far out of control.

Of course. but who says that the tailgating jerk is a &quot;self-respecting carrier 
of a firearm&quot;?  If he were a reasonable human being he wouldn't be tailgating 
us...

 &gt; &gt; He'd probably get off, too. After all, I pointed a gun at him...
 &gt; 
 &gt; Having been accosted by police because of paintball guns in the past, I
 &gt; can attest to their validity as &quot;threatening objects&quot;.

Yep.  We've even had kids with squirtguns shot and killed by police officers 
who thought the all-too-realistic toy was real in the dark alley.

I promptly threw away my black squirtgun that looked remarkably like a 9mm 
Beretta.  All my kids squirters now either don't look like real pistols or are 
bright neon pink or green.  Preferably both...
