Well, I have the bus in the garage and removed all the gas from the tank. 
Will be taking the tank off to have it cleaned at a radiator shop. Up in 
the front, behind the grill I noticed a fan which I assume is for fresh 
air in the interior. Behind the fan is what appears to be a radiator?? 
Anyone know what an air-cooled vehicle is doing with a radiator in in?
