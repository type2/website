Thought all you folks out there would get a kick out of this, and maybe 
some of you will have a better idea of what it actuallyy is than I do.  
Usual disclaimers apply, of course: just saw the ad and thought it 
sounded like fun.

1989 TRISTAR, rare, 1 owner, 35,000 mi, collectible, EPA sticker for USA, 
only 19 built in N. America, fact. mags, pw, pdl, ps, GL'd, exc. cond.
$39,500  Call (604) 756-0571 Nanaimo, B.C.

Photo: Real big double cab P/U, with &quot;4WD&quot; in big letters ahead of the 
front door.  My guess is this is a synchro double cab version of the 
Volkswagen LT, the mutant vehicle that looks like a vanagon but is about 
1/3 larger in every dimension.  From what I can see in the photo, it 
looks very clean (sano!), very mean.

At the current exchange rates, $39,500 CDN works out to about $28,800 US.

But you can't sleep and cook in it, so I'm keeping mine.
