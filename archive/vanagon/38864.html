Talked with a Schwimmer driver once, old WWII German guy living in a 
splittie bus in the Spanish Pyrenees Mtns.  He said they were terrifying to 
'drive' in the ocean, he had been in Greece in the war.  Wave would rush 
towards the Schwim., tower overhead, and at the last second the vehicle 
would bob up the face of the wave then surf/plow down the backside.  Said it 
scared him everytime he went in the water.  Probably great in lakes/rivers 
:).   Tim Smith
