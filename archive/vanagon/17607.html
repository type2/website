Subject: A very cool trick for sealing fresh air hoses to the tinwork

        Well, as we are all in the sprit of overheating our little jewels, 
here's something that I learned today.  I had been meaning to replace my 
fresh air hoses, but have been waiting to aquire some seals for the fresh 
air hoses.  I stopped by a local VW mechanic, and he told me this:  use some 
small vaccum hose, slit it lengthwise and make your own.  Well, I find that 
7/64 ths is a real good size to use.  My old hoses would wear right through 
in no time because I have an extractor exhaust system.  No more!

Cost something like $.75.  My tip: cut them a little linger than you think 
you'll need, they stay put with no adhesive.   

Also, My wife and I washed the bus today.  Didn't know it was _that_ white.  

and, we found curtain material which is striped, not plaid, but the color of 
beige matches the insides perfectly! and is only $2.00/yard!

Too cool.
