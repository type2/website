Subject:      '85 Starter Selnoid

Hey everybody I have an '85 with lots of miles on it. The only major
problem is that the starter selnoid tends to stick (I think) and it won't
start. I used to be able to free it by

1) Slamming my door while turning ignition key
2) Moving gearshift from 1st to 2nd while turning ignition

Unfortunately now it's getting a lot harder to get it started...it
requires a little banging with a hammer on the starter to free it. Does
anybody know if there is a way to clean it out or something?

Any suggestions are appreciated!

Aaron
