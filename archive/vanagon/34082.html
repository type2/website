    Just saw the movie Mr. Holland's Opus.  Good movie!!  Anyway,  in front
of the Holland's apartment and later their house is a very nice looking
21-window.  It is red and white and looks great except for the dent in the
front drivers side.  Also Mr. Holland owns a Corvair which stays in the
family for about 30 years.  Hope I didn't ruin it for ya!:)
