Subject:      if you people don't stop moving around ...

ok. a busy day in the stat dept. more people getting on, and some dropping
off. it's a sad day for the 1973's ... they are down by 2 now. the 1971's
are in the lead still. :)

just in case anyone wants to join in the ruckus, here's a list of the
folks who i have marked as 'unknown'. if you'd like to let me know what
model/year bus you have (or if you'd rather be 'classified' as a Wanabus
... haven't got one yet, but thinking about it) ...
