Subject:      '90/'91 Adventurewagon lust

I owned a '68 westy for a long while, had something of an (early) mid-life
crisis and bought a Miata a few years back....a fun go-kart, and quite
a blast on back roads, especially after driving a van that had the
aerodynamics of a toaster :-)

But now the thrill is gone.  Now I've come back to my senses and am lusting
for a VW camper conversion once again.

But I haven't found exactly what i want yet. I'm looking for a
**'90 or '91 Adventurewagon** conversion, perhaps a syncro (?).

I've talked to the fellow who did the conversions, but haven't quite
yet hit the mark yet. So if You hear of a **'90 or '91 Adventurewagon** for
sale (preferably in CA or the Western US, but hey, I might be up for a
cross-country trip again!) please let me know.

Thanks,

Stephen
