Subject: Road Trip From Hell



To All:

This is part sermon, part saga.  I'm not sure which part is which.

I had to make a trip to Modesto, four hundred miles and change from my home
in Vista, near San Diego.  Weapon of choice was my 1967 baja'd beetle, mostly
because it's faster than the '65 bus and gets better mileage.  The bug has
one seat.  It is heavily modified.

Left Vista at noon on Tuesday, arrived in Modesto about eight hours later.
 Weather was hot (90+) for most of the trip.  Average speed was high (80 to
90).  Combined with a lunch stop and a couple of 'comfort' stops, block-speed
worked out to about 60mph, fuel consumption a little better than 20mph.  No
problems noted although oil temp ran about 240 -- 20 degrees higher than
normal even for hot weather, and pressure about 40, 10 pounds lower than
normal.  Oil was 30W, a change from the usual 20W-50 in anticipation of the
hotter weather in the Central Valley.  And yes, it did get warm.

Driving around Modesto I noticed a new sound from the passenger-side front
wheel.  Checked the bearing and found it failing.  Cleaned the hub, replaced
inner &amp; outer but was forced to re-use the old oil seal, unable to find a
replacement.

But the problem wasn't with the bearing, it was with the spindle.  Before I
acquired the car it had suffered a spun outer bearing on the right front
spindle.  Apparently the long high-speed run up highway 99 had allowed enough
motion between the race and the spindle to wear it below spec.  That's just a
guess; I carry a lot of tools when I travel but no precision instruments.
 But the new bearing was a loose fit.

Shopped for a replacement spindle at all of the local junkyards.  Found some
nice buses including a pair of Westies (Pic &amp; Pull, near Empire, east of
Modesto) but only eight bugs, only one of which had spindles I could use and
of course they were already gone.

Decided to head home early, take it slow.  Big mistake here was to elect to
travel south via Interstate 5 instead of highway 99.  I-5 is pretty barren.
 Departed Modesto about 6 pm Friday, counting on low speed,  the cooler
evening hours and the slightly higher elevation of I-5 to keep the bearing
cool.

I spent nearly five hours to travel a couple of hundred miles south, stopping
frequently to let the bearing cool, repack the thing and so on. I had one
canteen of water (a gallon), used it to cool the bearing, repacked it twice.
  About 11pm  I knew I wasn't going to make it home on the spindle/bearing.
 Called home, told them I would be late.  Repacked the wheel bearing and
headed east, hoping to reach Fresno about 100 miles away.  Made it, or at
least close enough to count, but it was the middle of the night (temp still
in the high 80's).  I flaked out in the bug for a couple of hours, parked
outside a junkyard.  (There's a fore &amp; aft shelf instead of a passenger seat,
long enough for a stretcher.)   Local activity -- and the heat -- woke me up
about 6 am.  When I dismounted the wheel to repack the bearing, the cage came
apart.  So I went ahead and removed the spindle.  I wouldn't be able to drive
the bug but neither could anyone else.  

As luck would have it, the yard where I'd parked didn't have any air-cooled
VW's and no bugs at all but they put me onto one that did and a customer
offered to drive me other there.

I figured out what tools I'd need, made up a pack, put on my straw hat
(standard Baja-issue), slung the pack over one shoulder, canteen over the
other and started The Great Spindle Hunt.

I didn't have any luck finding a spare spindle around Fresno but picked up a
new set of bearings and an oil seal.  It was Saturday, hot -- over 100 -- and
busy.  I was wearing levis, boots, long-sleeved khaki shirt and a lot of
grease.  People were surprisingly kind; I had to pay for only one ride. The
costume may have helped, or perhaps it was the temperature -- 105 at one
point in the afternoon.

Finally located a spindle near Madera.  Hitched a ride and got there just
before they closed and was allowed to borrow a jack to facilitate removal of
the spindle; I had a small floor jack in the bug but didn't add it to the
pack due to the weight; I was giving lessons in sweating as it was.

Got back to the bug about seven thirty, called home -- they were getting a
little nervous.  Got the spindle installed, did a rough wheel alignment using
two pieces of plastic water pipe as a gauge.  Couldn't do anything about the
camber but got it close enough to work. Cleaned the hub with gasoline (the
bug carries 25 gallons), got everything back together, started home.  

Pretty dopey from the heat &amp; work; probably a little dehydrated even though
I'd downed at least a gallon of fluids during the day.  Kept the speed down.
 Got to the top of the Grapevine about 1130, called home to tell them I'd be
a little later than expected.  It was cool up there, 4,000 feet above the
valley floor.  Had some coffee from the truck, smoked a pipe.  Dismounted the
wheel to check &amp; adjust the new bearing.  Couldn't find the metric allen
wrench for the spindle nut.  Had to empty the whole damn bug, search
everything before I found it in the pack.  (I used a piece of nylon luggage
with a shoulder strap as the pack to carry the tools when I went hunting for
the spindle.)  Saw that as a sign; put all the tools back into their proper
places, re-packed my bag, taking the opportunity to change trousers.  But I
only had the one shirt, now a bit the worse for wear. (I'd left them hanging
back of the shop when I loaded the bug for the trip, drove off without them;
washed the one I had every night I was in Modesto.) 

Motored on down the mountain just in time to run into a freak rain storm
crossing the LA basin.  Lotsa lightning, heavy rain.  Engine ran fine but
started having some electrical problems, apparently due to a slipping fan
belt.  (The engine has no cover; if it rains, it gets wet).

Kept it rolling; there's really no place to pull off until you get across LA.
 Pulled off near San Onofre, adjusted the fan belt.  Ruddy moon just coming
over the mountains to the east, rising up through layers of clouds.  Odd,
fitful puffs of wind.  It started to rain again as I neared Oceanside.

I arrived home at 3:34 having been awake about 22 hours.  Total miles
traveled, 923 to make-good a distance of about 870.

If you want to lose weight, buy a Volkswagen.  I lost eight pounds in two
days :-)  

If you live in Modesto, forget using America On-Line; local access is only
2400 baud.  (Sandy Eggo runs 38,400.)

If you travel for a few days, remember to No Mail the Vanagon list servor;
musta been a couple hundred messages in the mailbox when I turned this thing
on.

Always carry a spare right-front spindle :-)
