&gt;&gt;Haven't followed the thread, but JCW has &quot;Urethane Shift Coupler Kits for 
&gt;&gt;$7.59 for the 68-79 and $13.95 for the 50-67. Page 4 of current (expires 
&gt;&gt;March 31) VW catalog. I'm ordering mine today (because I need it) and 
&gt;&gt;I'll be happy to report on quality to the list if desired.
&gt;
&gt;The urethane coupler kit I bought for my '71 from JCW was from Bugpack.  It
&gt;included the cage and the urethane bushings but not the pin and retainer (I
&gt;reused my old one).  I recall seeing the pin/retainer in the RMMW catalog
&gt;and I believe the kit they sell includes everything.  My new coupler has
&gt;worked well now for over 1 1/2 years.

I got one from RMMW and it did indeed include everything.  (Mine was for a
T2; I'd assume the T1 would be similar.)  Works fine but I don't have that
many miles on it.
