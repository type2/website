Don't count on any parts for your '74 engine. The busses built 
down there never used the pancake engine. I wouldn't venture too far 
unless you have emergency cash or time for getting parts from the States.

&gt; 
&gt;  	i am planning to travel in mexico, central and south america in my
&gt; 	74 camper, how's the availibility of engine parts for that
&gt; 	year?  i am now making a list of things to buy for my trip
&gt; 	if you have any suggestions please share!
&gt; 	i am doing the following things
&gt; 
&gt; 		1)i will try to buy as much oil before i leave the u.s.
&gt; 		
&gt; 		2)phase II tool kit
&gt; 	
&gt; 		3)talking on the internet about what makes a vw  tick
&gt; 	
&gt; 		also, i have only owned my vw for 7 months now and 
&gt; 		haven't had any major problems, but i plan to take 
&gt; 
&gt; 		about a month and check the brakes, steering, and 
&gt; 		engine, (possibly remove it to fix that pesky
&gt; 		oil leak).  
&gt; 
&gt; 		this is my plan i hope it comes works out.
