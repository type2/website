Subject: Re: Yokohama Y370's $

&gt;&gt; Does anyone have another source where I can get them at a better price?
&gt;&gt;  Maybe I need to go to Montreal and get them for $109 Canadian :-| ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;Probably doesn't help much, but I got mine for $108 CDN (actually 
&gt;paid $80 after trade in allowance of old tires). That's in Vancouver, 
&gt;BC though.

&gt;I just kept calling places until I found one that knew this tire and 
&gt;had them in stock. It helped that the owner of the shop drives a '67 
&gt;bus, and knows them well.... ;)

I'd love an excuse to visit Vancouver again, beautiful city and great folks.
 We visited in 1991.  However I know my tires won't make it.  The rest of the
van has been good to me though.  I'll keep at it :)
