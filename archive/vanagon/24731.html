Subject: Timing on 1600DP
Date: Wed, 13 Sep 1995 11:20:40 -0500 (CDT)

I was wondering about the timing on my '71 bus.  This is a stock 
1600DP with an 009, single QP and Weber progressive.  I am running 87 
octane fuel in it.  I have it set at 28 degrees total advance at 3,000
rpm.  I am at 1,100 feet or so.  In all those posts I saved about 
timing the only one I found pertaining exactly to this is that I can 
run this advance with 89 octane and that I sacrifice power for engine 
life going with less.  Should I do that?  Run less advance that is?  
BTW, it runs very nicely like this.  It seems on the edge of not 
passing the dipstick test but I expect that right now since it still 
has less than 200 miles.  Thanks, Jim
