Subject: Stock Oil Cooler Source?
Date: Mon, 19 Jun 1995 15:22:32 -0500 (CDT)

I am in need of a brand new stock oil cooler for my '71 bus.  The 
prices I see from all the major sources range as much as $40, which is
a big chunk of change for me now that I am selling books and cd's for 
vw parts.  :)  So, where is the cheapest most complete setup.  I need 
one with all the seals and such included so that the chances of me 
messing something up are as low as possible.  I will pay a little more
if I know the source is reliable.  Thanks, Jim
