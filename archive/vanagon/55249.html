Subject: Re: Auto Transmission Blues 90 Carat

&gt;My 90 Carat with 106K automatic trans is starting to act peculiar.  I
&gt;had it serviced (fluid and screens cleaned), but no help.  Symptoms are
&gt;when shifting from 2nd to 3rd on low level of acceleration, seems to
&gt;shift to 3rd,  then release and apparently head back to 2nd.  Engine
&gt;revs like it is almost in neutual.  After a few seconds, it goes back to
&gt;3rd and seems OK.  Under hard acceleration, it shifts as expected/as is
&gt;should.  No other funny noises.  Has anyone else had this?  Am I looking


I was/am considering doing the same flush/screen work (on Audi and crewcab),
but was advised by a friendly (but British car) mechanic that all new ATF
will clean out the clutch packs too well and they will then slip.  Also...
there is a gear pump inside the trans to power the pistons/actuators that
work the brake bands for controlling shift.  Maybe something is 'too clean'
in there now? Now a lower pump pressure?  I think the bands are adjustable
somehow.  Did you put in synthetic ATF? Please post your responses to
me/list? thanks, Tim
