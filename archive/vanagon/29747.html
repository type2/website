&gt; &gt; I was under the impression that I could 
&gt; &gt; remove the drums without removing the 46mm nut.  Is this true?  
&gt; 
&gt; NO! You have to remove the nut. Get the right tool and use a hammer
&gt; on the tool as well as a long breaker bar. 

I don't have any problem with getting the two piece drum
apart, but I take it apart rather frequently as I prefer adjusting
the brakes that way rather than trying to figure out which way
to hammer the star while lying on my back....:) Of course, If
I could get the star lubed so well as to actually being able 
to turn it without a hammer.......

Anyway, you might have to take off the hub to get the thing
apart the first time, but if you get everything cleaned up, 
you should be able to just take the outer part off in the future.
