Subject: The Unexpected trip (Final chapter)

The morning of my expected departure found four inches of snow in the ground, with more snow continuing to fall.  My niece (who is from Houston) had never seen snow, and was exstatic (sp?).  I on the other hand, was kinda concerened.  I had never driven Olga (my 71 westy) in the snow, and didn't have real snow tires.  The weatherman was predicting that the snow would stop by 10:00, so there was hope!!  

Believe it or not, the snow ceased to fall exactly at 10:00.........And started again at 10:10.  But after a great farewell breakfast with my family, I was on the road at about 11:00.

The wind was fairly calm, and I gotta say Olga handled great in the snow!  The Thruway was in excellant condition, just a bit wet as we retraced our steps back to Buffalo, then south to Cleveland.

Boringly enough, the trip was completely uneventful.  The weather offered the only interest, with snow, then rain, then snow then rain again all the way through New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.  I stopped for the night at a KOA near Columbus.  

Considering the night registration sign requested $25 for a site, I figured...Great, hot showers, and a nice comfortable bathroom!!!!   WRONG!
No showers, and the bathrooms were all locked.... But, I did get electricity and water for my investment.

I slept quite well that my second night in Olga, but awoke to find about two inches of snow on the bus.  The storm had found me again....After breakfast and a quick wash up in the cold water, I was on my way at 6:30 heading for home!!!

I must note that all this time I had NOT seen another bus on the road.  I had covered almost 2000 miles, and Olga was proud to be the only bus on the road.  I can't begin to tell you how many interesting stares, gawks, and unbelieving looks I got though... Especially from youngsters.

Then it happened....I was crusing through southern Kentucky, after visiting the Jim Beam distillery (which was quite interesting, but no free samples...other than the bourbon chocolates), when I saw approaching me ANOTHER BUS!!!  Olga and I were both overjoyed!!  I quickly reached for the headlight switch, and flashed as the approaching bus flashed back, and then was gone....

By the time I got to Nashville, the snow and rain had stopped, and sunshine greeted us as we hit I-40 for the last leg of our journey.

We had just puttered out of N'ville when HARK!! What is that??? ANOTHER BUS!!  This time it was in my lane...heading west.  I quickly overtook it (noticing that it had Virginia plates), and waved to it's only occupant.  She was going pretty slow, so I figured I would stop up ahead and see if I could be of any help.  The bus passed me by as I pulled in behind her, and we stopped together.  Her name was Deb, and she was on her way to New Mexico to visit her brothers.  She had left Hampton Virginia three days before, and hoped to make it to Memphis that night.  We talked for about half an hour, I provided duct tape so she could seal off the air seeping in through her louvered windows, and she repayed me with some great oatmeal cookies her mother had made for the trip.  I gave her some names of reliable VW mechanics in Memphis in case she had any trouble, and we were off again.  Unfortunately her 73 westy was only able to maintain about 55mph, despite its new engine, so I quickly lost sight of her in my rear v
iew mirror.  I hope she made it ok!!

Sunset found me pulling into my house in Memphis, with my dogs, new baby and wife to greet me....

Stats for the trip....2455 miles in 4 1/2 days.  Average mpg: 18.5
Oil consumption: 1/2 quart.  Repairs: None.  Other Bus sightings: 2

thanks for listening......
