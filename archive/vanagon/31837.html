&gt; Seriously, this feels like a great conversion to me, now that the throttle
&gt; is set up right. The Holley carb and direct exhaust may be helping the power
&gt; somewhat, tho I don't know what the engine was like before they were
&gt; installed. I believe the Vanagon may be lighter than an EV, and it has
&gt; a much shorter-geared transmission than an S10. All these add up  to
&gt; sports-car-like acceleration, though not like my old Mustang.

I'm sure you know I'm just joshing you back engined folks (I'll 
eventually get a splittie (23 deluxe is my dream)  And grew up with bay 
window campers.

The S10 is geared to use up its engine power way to early.  It can beat 
the EV from a dead stop but runs out of oomph right when the EV gets 
going.  EV is a autobahn runner compared to an S10 city hauler.  

&gt; Gas mileage suffers (17 mpg freeway), but this thing is a blast to drive,
&gt; and is surprisingly quiet. The heater out of a Volvo, beneath the back seat, 
&gt; kept me toasty in a snowstorm at night in the mountains north of LA before
&gt; Christmas. In truth, my old '69 bus with original German heater boxes,
&gt; did the same in the mountains west of Denver, in 0 degree winters, except
&gt; going downhill.

I get 20-23 in the S10.  18-20 in the EV.  Darned automatic...

Your Vanagon is probably quieter than my EV.  Plan on insulating behind 
the interior panels as the warranties all run out.

&gt; You pays your money and you takes your choice, I guess.

Unless I can get an affordable 'EV' T4 double cab Syncro somehow I hope to 
get a 'Vanagon' T3 Double cab synchro.  Also HAVE to get an old Vanagon 
and call it Kurt.  Maybe an old junker that I can convert into a 
playhouse/shed that the kids can 'have'.  Gee what am I a &quot;poor white 
trash red-neck&quot; wanting dead vans in the yard?  I did grow up in the sort 
of South. (Shenadoah Valley of Virginia)

I'm sure we've bored the other here quite enough though...
