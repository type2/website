Subject: Re: Replacing Fuel Valve Cable


&gt;&gt; On busses to about 63 or so, there was a pull cable located in front
&gt;&gt; of the seat to operate the reserve fuel valve.  This valve is a work
&gt;&gt; around for not having a gas tank.

&gt;A work around for no gas tank?  Is it like a wind up toy?  WHIZZZ....

It's like one of those toys that you pull the string on and it goes.
