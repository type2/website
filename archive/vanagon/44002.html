     Hi,  I'm unsubbing for 2 weeks while I take a much needed vacation.  
     We're piling in &quot;Horst&quot;, the '66 standard/camper with rebuilt GEX and 
     heading for Virginia.  The motor has 600 miles on it and seems to be 
     ready for a road test.  One oil leak below the oil pump which is not 
     getting worse.  Compression is good.  Oil temp is good.  Sounds good, 
     runs good.  We're off.  I'll report back in about 2 weeks.  see ya.
