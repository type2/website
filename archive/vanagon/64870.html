Subject:      Re: starting problems

Snip &lt;&lt;Needless, to say that was the end of my tests... can't test for a
problem
that no longer exists. Does the continuity test tell me that the switch is
good, or can there be other problem in the switch itself?  Any thoughts on
where to start my tests next time?&gt;&gt;

Try this: Have someone crank the engine and at the same time take a
implement of some sort and give the starter/solenoid a tap or whack. If the
contacts are dirty or mis-shaped the &quot;whack&quot; should fire the van right up.
This was the case with my 87gl syncro.
I had the starter replaced and have not had a problem since (a year or so).
