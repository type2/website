Subject: Broken antenna on 87 vanagon

add one to the &quot;failed stupid Vanagon tricks&quot; file:

I usually use a self-serv car wash, but decided to treat
myself to the luxury of a drive-thru carwash the other day.
(heck, it was only $4. w/coupon)

Unfortunately, I forgot to push the stock antenna down
first.... and it bent/broke in the process.

Was wondering what options I have for replacements? Is it easy
to install a newer, flexible and higher powered one? How much $?

any recommendations/sources appreciated.
