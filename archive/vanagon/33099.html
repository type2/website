I could also use some of the big &quot;Elephant Ear&quot; mirrors and I'm even
thinking of converting to a sunroof while its gutted if I can find a
suitable roof clip near San Diego.

Any helpful comments or suggestions will be coveted.

if you add on a sunroof top, add subfloor pans, or the bus wont be
structurally sounds.   You can buy repops from Das Bulli Haus.   (I am not
associated with)

all sunroof buses and doors on both side buses came with them
