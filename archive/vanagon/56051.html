Dereyk:

A good test to see if the vibration is caused by your wheels or tires is:

  1) Jack up either the front our rear of your bus

  2) Take one of the tires and spin it

  3) Take a white or yellow crayon, hold it very steady, and mark a line
     around the circumference of the tire close to the center of the tread
     while the tire is spinning

Examine the line you made.  If it seems to move side-to-side as it goes around 
the tire with respect to the tire's tread pattern, then you have either a 
defective tire OR a bent rim (wheel).

Repeat the test for all of your tires.

For the tires that seem to be wobbling, take a run-out gauge and repeat the 
above test, measuring sideways rim run-out.  If the rim is OK, then it's the 
tire.

For any tires you don't replace, check them for dynamic balance.  Any tire 
shop can to this.

NOTE:  When you mount wheels to your bus, follow factory recommended torques
       when tightening the lugs.  Over torquing will distort your disks or
       drums.  Most tire shops will over torque your lugs!.  This can also
       lead to vibration, especially during braking.

You might want to note that the Tire Rack sells OE takeoffs.  These are very 
slightly used original equipment steel rims that where removed when customers 
upgraded to alloy wheels on new vehicles.
