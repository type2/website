&gt;Do the air cooled vanagon engines have these little spray jets too?

i'm pretty sure that the air-cooled vw's do NOT have spray jets ... it's
pretty expensive (i understand) to design into the engine, and only folks
like porsche and such put them in. the vw's do have splash-thingies that
are supposed to splash the oil up under the pistons, though. at least that's
what i've been told (it's kinda dark and dangerous inside that engine when
it's running!!)

&gt;Also would it be outrageous to put the extra oil cooler for a vanagon in
&gt;the front grille a la porsche or wasserboxers?

one real big problem (that actually occurred on a 911 that was being
'upgraded'): the cooler way up front in the air-stream made the oil TOO
cool: it never warmed up. so they had to move the cooler to the 'normal'
porsche position which was inside one of the fender wells. i fear the same
might be true if you added a cooler on the front of a bus: what with nearly
15 feet of oil hose from the engine up to the cooler and the same again
coming back, you might well never heat up the oil.

also: how much extra oil would it take? :) you might be putting in 8 quarts
per change. and jacking up the front of the car to get it all out.

just some thoughts.
