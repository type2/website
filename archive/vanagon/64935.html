Subject:      PNW camping Sept. 13/14

Hello all VW northwestern campers:
        Only a couple of interested people responded against the eastern OR
camping site, citing distance reasons. Although these are completely
valid, majority rules, so as far as I am concerned, our first camping
trip will be to the described Union, OR site. I feel that we have to put
an end to this location ambiguousness, since it complicates the
organization process quite a bit, and we are only ten days away.
        So, anyone that knows will be attending please send me a note. It
doesn't really matter, because a bunch of us will be there anyway, but
since there is limited camping sites it would be nice to have a general
idea of the number of vehicles that are planning to show up.
        Vince and Jack: we can meet somewhere in Corvallis so I can join you.
Most likely, Kim will be interested in joining us with her '78 Westie,
too.
        I am posting an announcement in the CCC list, see if anyone is &quot;crazy&quot;
enough to join us...(Ron, are you coming?)
Hope to see a lot of you there!
Cris
Eugene, OR.
'91 Westie &quot;Fafner&quot;
'66 Kombi
'67 Deluxe (parts bus, no title) :(
