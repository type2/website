Subject: window tinting - I smell a FAQ

A nasty ol' FAQ...

While we're at it, what state has the strictest window tinting laws?

I'm sure that we all love to travel across state lines in our boxes, and no
one wants to get hassled over something dumb like tinted windows.  We can
tint our windows to suit the state with the strictest laws, or at least,
the strictest laws of the strictest state that we can forsee traveling in. 
Got it?

So let's post what the laws are pertaining to each of our respective
states, and I'll collect the data, and repost it.
Maybe we can even add it to the FAQ.
