&gt;Why do you need brighter headlights?  If anything, they need to be dimmer.

ooooooooh, but yooooooooo don't have the old style sealed beam headlights
of the older bus what was being discussed, oh turgid one! and, as everyone
who is anyone already knows, older buses need headlights as bright as they
can get.

&gt;I've gotten occassional flashing brights form others from day one. :[
&gt;And I know they're not miss-aligned.  Halogens just fool ya sometimes.

it's not the halogen part, cause i have 60W H4 bulbs in my Cibie Z-Beams ...
it's the lense pattern. and for some idiotic reason, the manufacturers seem
to be wanting to spray the light all over the damn place, instead of
focusing it out in front. my Z-Beams have a really nice pattern with a very
shape cut-off ... unless (1) i have my headlights on high beam, or (2) the
other car is a go-cart, or perhaps a porsche 914, my lights don't blind
anyone ... and they are halogen.

&gt;I've noticed that with other cars, even on sedan that are lower to the
&gt;ground.

that's the New Improved Standard for Automobile Vehiclular Forward Lighting.
section 7.23.A.14.i(x) says that the maker must illuminate ALL trees and
bushes within a 300 foot semi-circle of the front bumper, including ALL those
trees and bushes overhead. (See also Section 7.89.Z.01 (a), Recognizing and
Avoiding Falling Possums; see also Section 7.89.Z.02 (a), Recognizing and
Avoiding Suicidal Armadillos).

but anyway, more volts to the headlights means more safety for the driver of
the bus. all them yuppies in them little cars is wearing sunglasses anyway.
