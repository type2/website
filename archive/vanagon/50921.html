&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;        I called the &quot;VW dealer&quot; here in Traverse City, MI to check on the
&gt;cost of a rear heater core for my '86.
&gt;        When the parts guy got back to me he first apologized, I knew that
&gt;this was going to be bad news. Over $800!! We discussed the part, and we
&gt;agreed that that was what I wanted. It was NOT the whole box, just the
&gt;heater core.

They are mistaken (or crooks)--I purchased a rear heater core (part # 867
819 121A) from a dealer last year for $152.80. And I thought that was
expensive! No way this part is $800. Make sure you're just getting the core
and none of the ancillary bolt-on stuff like the shut off valve. If they
still want $800, call Camelback VW at 800.876.5199. Tell them you want the
Internet discount and I bet they'll send you one for less than $150.
