&gt; Hi All~
&gt;         Sorry to clutter this list with such a basic question for all you
&gt; pros. I am looking for a good source (ie name, phone or address) of a place
&gt; to pick up a copy of the Bentley manual. I have an '81 if that helps.

Try your local VW dealer or Bentley direct at 800.423.4595.
