Subject: Pete Sellers loves his Eurovan

I could perhaps learn to love the Eurovan's looks, although right now no other
van looks as &quot;right&quot; to me as the Vanagon (the only flaw of which is the
proportion of the tires in the wheelwells; another rationale for 15&quot; wheels).
But talk to me about performance.  How is it, stock, and are there ways to
enhance it, e.g. by using parts from something sportier that used the same
engine block?
