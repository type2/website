Hi Vern/Heather,

Check for water leaks, they seem to be the topic of the year!  There are
many FAR more experienced folks than I (on this list) to advise you
exactly where to start.  This should give you an area to concentrate you
attention and questions on though.

Yet, 55,000 miles does not seem like a great deal of mileage for an 87
Vanagon, I suppose you should try and verify this figure from smog
certs, service records etc (maybe you can get the price down
accordingly).

Best,

Chris Gibbs
