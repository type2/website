&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Yeah but when was the last time VW even one this one?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Back in 1985, the VW GTI was Motor Trend's car of the year.
&gt;

Exactly my point, and why, because a '85 GTI could probably have been
had in the $7000 region nicely equipped.  A friend bought the first
16V our dealer got in '87 for about that, hell maybe a bit more and used
it as a autocrosser because it had NO AC, NO SUNROOF, NO 20 WAY ASS
WARMING POWER SEATS, NO POWER STUFF, just the 16V, the GTI suspension
and the standard Recaro's.  It was a great car and at the time still a
great price.  This IMHO is where VW killed the Corrado, hoping the
exclusivity approach would sell enough cars, only topped out models were
produced, after horrendous '90 sales with left overs barely asking $1000
below sticker VW thought about base models sans powere equip and at the
time a lower entry model in the form of the 16V unit sold in Europe and
maybe Canada.  They did not follow up, sales dwindled to 16,000 over 5
years and so it ended.  Picking a favorite of mine, look at industrious
Chrysler importing the tri-star Eclipse/Talon/Pl what?,  OK cars by any
right particularly the top end turbo 4wd versions which will trounce a
VR6 Corrado without thinking, but for every 1 of those Tsi Gsx models
you see 20 base models that sold for $12k.  No exclusivity but
100,000's of units in the same 5 years, I would have preferred VW still
selling the Corrado by the tens of thousands and still selling it to a
little exclusivity.  And I guess my real point is do we hear the drums in
the distance for the EV in the same way, oh yeah bring out the VR6 model
charge $5k more than what the 5 cyl was going for and then POOF, big
VW van ceases to exist in America.
