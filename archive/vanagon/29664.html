Subject: '78 bus is missing

A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned a '78 bus that I found while driving 
around.  The owners sent me the keys via FedEx, but when I went to go get 
the bus, it was GONE!  The owners don't know what happened to it, but 
supposedly they called the police to find out if it had been towed.  I 
have not heard from them for 2 weeks.  

I received many requests for parts (about 20 letters), and I'll be happy 
to take care of these requests once the bus is found.  However, at this 
point the location of the bus is a mystery.  later.....
