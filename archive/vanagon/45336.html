Subject: Transporter Camper camping equipment supplies info needed

Hi,
I write here via WWW, so please reply to me directly since I do not
subscribe to this group (I will when I find out how).
I just purchased 1973 VW Bus camper (not Westfalia but AST (ATS?))
which went through a major restoration by the previous owner.
The only remaining tasks are cabinets and fixtures (ice box (fridge?),
sink, heater, stove, etc).
Are there good sources of stuff like this?
I found in FAQ only one supplier, I called and left a message,
but I am sure that must be more.
Is fridge really worth the cost?

Thanks for your input,

Thaddeus Konar
