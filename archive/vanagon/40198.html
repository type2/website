Subject: gas smell part II
Date: Sat, 20 Apr 96 18:31:35 EDT

Hey all,
All right, following the advice of list members, I pried off the pie
plate in the engine compartment ('78) and didn't quite expect the ECU to
be right there but found the filler neck.  I didn't feel and gas on it
so I got up on the bumper and rocked that sucker hard (very full tank),
reached back in there and didn't find any gas anywhere.  Reached in as
far as I could, almost to the tank, no gas.  Reached as far up the
filler neck as I could, no gas.  So, that's not where my gas smell is
coming from.  Which raises the question, where the hell is it coming
from??

Possible leaky vent tube connection on tank??  

I checked all connections to and from the charcoal canister in the
engine compartment and everything seemed ok.  I don't smell gas in the
engine compartment, just inside the van in the rear cargo area is where
it's especially strong, although it does diffuse throughout the entire
van.  

Any other ideas folks??  I know you're full of 'em :)

Thanks in advance,
Sean
