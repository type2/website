Subject: Re: Wasserboxers with Gas Heaters?

Hi Everyone.  When we ordered our '90 Syncro Westy this heater was offered 
as a $1500 option.  We were advised to stay away from it as it was 
prone to problems, and would only run for 20 minutes at a time.  This 
was for camping, not necessarily for when driving.  I've seen one 
Westy with this option, and the owner wasn't that happy with it.

Harry.

&gt; There is a factory-installed gas heater in an '84 Westfalia that is in the
&gt; Roamin' Holiday fleet. It's a Canadian model (from Alberta), and I assume
&gt; that was an available option generally in Canada in that year.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know what type it is, or how easy it would be to transplant it into
&gt; another Vanagon. It works the same as the gas heaters in air-cooled models:
&gt; turn a knob on the dash, and after ignition the heater works for about 15-20
&gt; minutes, then shuts off on it's own. It does not have a thermostat.
