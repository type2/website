Subject:      Re: Audi 4000 gauge panel fits a Vanagon

Concerning the panel from an Audi fitting the vanagon I've looked at
several in the junkyards over the couple of days and haven't seen one
that would fit without some cutting.  these were out of Audis and Jettas
,did you take a bandsaw to the console or am I looking at the wrong
models. The one that fits is out of an Audi 4000s correct?
