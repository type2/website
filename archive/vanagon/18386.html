   take me a little while to redo the wiring on the `74, so I'm not going
   to do much to it until I get some response about the EFI...Are there
   any EFI gurus, or has everyone done the dual carb thing?

   I'm under the impression that the only '74 busses that had EFI were
   California automatic transmission models. You may have a '75? An easy 
   way to check would be the engine code. '74s had engine code AW and '75s 
   are ED. Another difference &lt;of no functional significance&gt; is the controls
   for the turn signals and winshield wiper were integrated into the 
   steering column in '75, '74s still had the seperate, &quot;clamp-on&quot; variety.

   The fridge, if this is a Westy, is electric only &lt;12v/110v&gt; in '74 and
   '75. The propane is just for the stove.
   
   What are your plans for this bus? If you are going to sell any parts off
   of it, I'm in need of the little fold up table and shelf unit that is
   attached to the fridge cabinet, if it hasn't been devoured by the
   sliding door already. Did either of these buses come with a westy tent??
   Coveting minds want to know....


   Best regards,
