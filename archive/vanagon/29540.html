&gt;Geez, how'd your poor friend get stuck with one of those lousy westy 
&gt;tents?  They're not worth a thing, but I suppose I could take it off 
&gt;his/her hands to save the disposal fee at the dump (but only 'cause I'm 
&gt;such a nice guy!).  ;-)  ;-)
&gt; 
&gt;Seriously, I don't have any idea what they're worth here.

I don't know what it's worth, but I'll buy it.

Have your friend e-mail me or you can e-mail me and I'll give you my phone
number.
