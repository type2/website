This morning, at about 15 deg F, the
'78 bus started sluggishly but, and
here's the thing, I couldn't get it
into reverse.  The pattern is, as you
know, down-left for reverse and I
could not do the &quot;down&quot; portion.  Well,
actually, I eventually did but at great
effort.  Really, it was the down that
I could not do.  Once rolling, shifting
was a little sluggish, but I am sad to
report that a 20 min drive did not
change anything with respect to the
no-reverse problem.

Might cold to contemplate lying in the
street doing major work, but what is
the diagnostic reading on this?

135,000 miles on it if that matters
payload is driver plus 300 pounds, ditto
