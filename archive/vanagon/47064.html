 Over the past month or so, my '87 (Syncro Westy) with 69k miles has begun
 running hot. Historically, the temp. gauge would sit right at the center
 (over the warning light) when the engine was at operating temp., and the
 cooling fan would only kick on in warm weather traffic. Now, in cool
 weather it's running 2/3 towards the top of the gauge, and the fan is
 coming on any time I'm not at highway speed.

Radiator simmply losing capacity(Internal film) or some how engine running
hotter due to some other cause (timing/mixture, etc).  The warm weather will
definetley add to this phenomana,(I can not spell).  Monitor the sistuation
and see what happens when temps get back to normal.
