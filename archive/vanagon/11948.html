Subject: Air leaks in ventilation system

Regardless of where I set the levers on the fresh-air and heat controls, air
continues to come through the vents in my '85 Vanagon.  Anyone else have
this problem? Will I have to go through what Gerry is going through with his
malfunctioning heater (i.e. dash removal, separating heater housings, etc.)?
