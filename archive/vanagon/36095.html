Subject: Why Vanagon Parts == $$$$

Latest greedy-dealer example:

The front rotors and pads on Syncro Larry's '87 are shot.  He 
calls dealer (just for yucks.) They quote $180, PER ROTOR. 
(This is the right ballpark: the dealer receipts from the POV 
of my '89 Syncro showed $400 for replacing both rotors.)

Larry calls old buddies at local shop where he used to work.  
Old buddy (wholesale) price: $30!!  Of course, they have to 
order them, but big whoop (local dealer didn't have 'em in 
stock neither.)  Two new rotors and pads for less than $100.  
Larry kicks in another $30 for goodwill, installs new brakes, 
satisfaction achieved.  Dealer rip-off thwarted.

Makes you wonder...
