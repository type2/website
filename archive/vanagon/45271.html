Subject: Stuck Clock, NH show

Hi all. After the long stretch of getting school over, I'm back , for a
while. Seigfried will bet bearing us to the Canadian Maritimes - New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island for three weeks next tues.
Can't wait!!! Now, I went to set the time on my digital clock, the one in
the middle of the dash cluster. I obviously pushed too hard on the little
button because now my hours keep blinking and I can't turn them off! Any
ideas? Second the New Hampshire VW Show is this weekend at the Hopkingto
State Fairgrounds. Camping out available Saturday night, the show is on
Sunday. Best way to get there? From the South, take I - 89 North from
Concord, NH and look for the signs, should be Exit 7 to Hopkington. From
the North, I am not sure. We hope to have signs coming off of Route 89. I
have only been there once so I am hesitant to give very detailed directions
and lose people. I - 89 is your best bet, look for signs, ask for the
Hopkington State Fairgrounds. Hope to meet some of you there!
