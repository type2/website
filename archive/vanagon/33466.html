remanufactured

&gt; the flick of a switch, announcing to the world my turns. . .and turning all
&gt; SuperBeetle drivers green with envy.  But no more.

&gt; P.S. Last month, someone stole the fuel cap off of my '79 Bus, so even
&gt; late-model Buses aren't immune.  (The #$_at_%! fuel cap?)
&gt; P.P.S.  Any suggestions as to how to protect semaphores from theft? Locking
&gt; devices, inscribed numbers, etc.?  Remember, old Buses got 'em too, I
think.

I came home once to find some Neanderf--- had taken the taillight lenses
off my 60 Singlecab while I was at work (daytime on a busy street!!).  This
after I had just bought them at a SOTO meet.  This was before any of the
repros were available, too!

When I put the new ones on, I soldered the phillips heads on the screws
flush, so you'd have to melt them clean to get the lenses off without
breaking them.  You might try this on your *next* set of  semaphores
(bummer, lenses were about 40 bucks, a lot less painful).  I wouldn't try
that on the gas cap, though. 8')

ouch!  what a nightmare

sometimes i'd get worried, parking my 61 w/ original safaris in the city....
 i've heard of glass taillights, vw symbols, safaris, ashtrays, etc. etc.
being ripped off, actually i got a phone call last week from a guy with an
original 56 23 window that his vw symbol had been ripped off, and windshields
smashed. 

 I'd have been a lot more sympathetic if he hadnt let it sit out in the rain
for years with the rear and corner windows smashed, and the water pouring in.
 the tail lights, reflectors, and brake light were all history too.  He wont
put a tarp on it, or sell it.   I hate that.
