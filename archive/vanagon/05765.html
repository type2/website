Subject: '80 Vanagon questions

I have an '80 Vanagon Westy and a number of questions-

1)I need to pull the engine due to low compression in #3, a mechanically
inclined friend, says the FI makes the engine run too lean especially with
an aftermarket exhaust.  Thus to solve any future problems and make it run
better (and cooler) rip the FI off and put on 1 two barrel progressive
weber (don't use a 2 carb setup because you end up with a right and a left
engine which are not always in sync).  Fast Freddy's quoted a price of $240
for a complete setup.  Has anyone made the switch?  Does this sound right?

2)I have some rust at the bottom of the left side middle window (above the
frig).  How hard is this to fix so it won't return, it seems common on this
model.  Any advice would be appreciated.

3)Best place to obtain miscel parts, a)both (F&amp;R) the bumper side guards
are missing from the right side.  b)the covers to the water and electical
inputs on the right side, and c)the emergency blinker dash switch.  Can
these be found anywhere besides the dealer if there, if so where?

4)There has been some talk about repacking CV joints.  How often is this
recommended?  I have owned the car 5 years and never done it.

Rick
