Subject: EV Winnie FS

FWIW local dealer at home just got in a '9? EV Winnie conversion.
The small one not the Rialta (one of which I saw today BTW south
of Cumberland MD, anybody passin through?) Anyway back to the EV
fully loaded camper conversion with all those neat LED bells and
whistles (you got nothing on my '78 I swear it, right) full power
package
(do they all come that way?) but 5 spd, 20k miles, white, has the
pull out awning? (again do they all come this way or is it optional?)
Looks nice clean he got it for a local interested party who I guess
backed
out.  Asked in passing and asking price about $28k they might dicker
pretty well on that, who knows I don't know if that is in line or not.

Located in Clarksburg, WV at Star Motor Company unfortunately
phone number is not handy.  They do have an 800 number so
try 800 info first.  Clarksburg in N central WV for anyone interested,
2.5 hours from Pittsburg, 4.5 from DC roughly.
