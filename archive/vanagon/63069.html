Subject:      Re: 1.9L TD update,`82 D-Westy conversion!

As per an article in &quot;european car&quot; (or was it &quot;vw&amp;porsche&quot; then), a
swap they did with a TDI block into an A2 Golf required clcearanceing of
the valve cover and to the hood insulation as the TDI engine assembly is
about an inch or so (to the best of my recollection) taller than the 1.6
assembly.

&gt; Well,
&gt; My new 1.9L TD finally arrived on Wed. I've been ohing and ahing ever
&gt; since. This is quite a spiffy motor, looks like it will just be a drop
&gt; in.
&gt; Modifying the engine mounts does not seem necessary, as is the case
&gt; when
&gt; using a 1.6L TD from a Jetta or Rabbit. The turbo is much smaller, so
&gt; it
&gt; appears there'll be plenty of clearance. The unit came with a factory
&gt; exhaust pipe which will have to be cut and redirected but no problem,
&gt; just
&gt; having the flange was more than I'd hoped for...
&gt;
&gt; Things to resolve: Air cleaner location and mate up to turbo.
&gt;                    Fabricate exhaust system
&gt;                    Pick-up tube extension for oil pump ( Scott Foss
&gt; has all
&gt; the above, for a price)
&gt;
&gt; I'm having my old DZ tranny rebuilt with 4.57 ring and pinion and
&gt; original
&gt; gearing. That should be as sufficient as any, short of a five speed.
&gt; It
&gt; should be back about Wed or so. Lots to do.
