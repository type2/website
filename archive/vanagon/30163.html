Ok, you asked for it! Here's a list of what's in the catalogue, 
part number and the price in Kronas (sp?). Anyone know the conversion
rate of Kr to $? I would suspect the price in France would be about 20%
more due to the VAT.

Underdash Console		kr950	120021
Top of Dash Console		kr210	120030
Ventshades			kr680	350200
Windshield Visor		kr2860	351900
Rearhatch Visor			kr660	351972
Ladder for Rear Hatch		kr1570	375110
Custom Grille Kit		kr750	844095
4 DE Headlight Kit		kr5990	041585
Rear Bumper Blend Kit		kr2390	806545
(this kit attaches to the rear hatch and eliminates the &quot;step&quot; on
the rear bumper)
Glass Sunroof			kr4390	351901


Interesting stuff. The only thing that is in the catalogue which can
be bought here is a pair of Hella 2000 rallye driving lights...approx
$125 for a pair.
