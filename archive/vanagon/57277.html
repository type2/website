 &gt;Jim,
 &gt;The previous mail on this is to long to post. 

You're tellin' me.  I had to type it!!   :)

&gt;Apparently we are talking Apples and Oranges (pun intended).
&gt;Is this stuff you are referencing physically orange in color. 

Yes.  I just took it to the kitchen and poured some into a glass.  Looks
pretty apetizing, like some orange flavored drink.  I think we may be talking
about Valencia oranges and Navel oranges.   :)

&gt;It is highly possible we have some &quot;newer&quot;
&gt;stuff here in the Houston area as about 99% of all this mess is made
&gt;within shouting distance of the Houston Ship Channel. The coolant I
&gt;investigated was supposed to last 7 years or 70,000 miles with no

That is clearly different than the &quot;460&quot; Prestone I have here.  4 years, 60K
miles.

&gt;degradation of the anti-freeze and anti-corrosion packages. Once again,
&gt;it is physically orange in color and 

Same color though.

&gt;it is marked -all over- the
&gt;containter with words to the effect &quot;Do not mix with ethylene glycol, or
&gt;basically anything except the 7/70,000 formula&quot;. So anyway, we are
&gt;obviously talking about different Phosphate-Free products from
&gt;Prestone.As well the parts counter help reiterated the warning as I
&gt;lugged 2 gallons up pay for. Sorry for the confusion.

The 460 stuff I have a gallon of here is about 1 year old.  I suppose the 770
stuff there may be a replacement product for the 460 stuff.  The 770 stuff
may be on the store shelves here as well.  I'll look tomorrow.  I wonder if
the 460 stuff will have the same problems as the 770 and they (Prestone) just
recently figgured this out.  I'll see if I can contact Prestone and see if
they can shed some information.

Thanks for following up on this and discerning that we were talking about two
different Prestone long life, phosphate free coolants.

Regards,
Jim Davis
