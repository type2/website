&gt; source telling him, &quot;just grab hold of the wires ... it won't hurt you!&quot;
&gt; &gt;ohyezzzz ... if they're arcing, you might be sparking, when you grab. ;)

&gt; The story reminded me of an incident that happened while I was working at
&gt; the local bicycle shop during my high school daze.  We were always playing
&gt; jokes and messing around as we were a fun loving group of hippie yahoos.
&gt; Being the wise person that I am now took years. I was really niave/gullible
&gt; as a kid. 

This reminded me of a joke I saw played on television - I think it was
for candid camera or something.  I know it's got nothing to do with
VWs, but it *is* Friday and Rusty started it!

I think the footage was shot somewhere in the UK.  There was this delivery
boy who always leaned his bike against a lightpost (which was a good 20 
feet tall) outside the store.  The bike was a ten-speed type.  One day
these guys drove up in one of those trucks with the scissor arm that they
use to work on telephone poles, and lifted the bike up above the pole and
set it down with the pole going through the frame!  I almost died laughing
when the guy came out of the store to deliver something on his bike and
tried to figure out how the heck that happened.  :)
