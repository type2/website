&gt;From: Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;

&gt;is that for real? i thought that was just a myth ... put out by the tire
&gt;companies. do the little sticky beasties really eat tires and rubber hoses?

I have read sometime ago about certain animals in Europe eating lower 
water hoses.  I guess when they are finished they have something to wash 
down the rubber.  Yum!


&gt;hmmmm. from porcupines to fried squirrel. are you sure it's not friday yet?

It's been a long week for me.
