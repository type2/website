Subject: Busses on '66' Flyers Available

If anyone would like a copy of the quicko-cheapo Busses on '66' flyer 
(with info and a map) send me your s-mail address.  Now if I could just 
get the graphic artist in charge of our professionally created June Bug 
Jamboree flyers to just get them finished before the show ...
