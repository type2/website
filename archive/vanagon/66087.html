Subject:      Rear Heater core leaking (help)!

Hi All,

The heater core under the rear seat of my 86 Westfalia is leaking coolant.  I've

taken off the blower etc, and isolated the leak to somewhere within the core
itself or the on/off valve (its not the tubing to/from the engine or around the
clamps).

Is replacing the core the only fix?  AND - if I do replace the core, how do I
bleed the air out of the system (also is it necessary to replace all the coolant

as per Bentley?? Sorry if this is obvious, I'm new to this :-)

Thanks in advance.

Jamie
