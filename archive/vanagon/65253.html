You don't need to do this at all!!!   Just mount it back about 5&quot; (you need
to drill new holes).   I've done this on two vans so far with totally
satisfactory results.   Looks fine.    I sent a prior msg about it, which
should be in the archives.

&gt;Well, I was one of the silly people who put a map pocket on the passenger

&gt;Phoie!
&gt;
&gt;I did some measuring, and I believe that if you cut away a small section of
&gt;the front of the map pocket away that you can provide enough clearance so the
&gt;glovebox will open with the door shut. I'm going to give this a try next
&gt;weekend, I'll let you know if it works.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else try this?
