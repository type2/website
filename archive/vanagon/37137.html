Subject: Aurgh! Vanagon climate controls make me mental
Date: Fri, 08 Mar 96 12:02:00 EST


Dear Vanagon:

OK, so I have only had my '89 Westie for two days, but you'd think that by 
now, having read the appropriate section of the manual numerous times, that 
I'd be able to figure out the convoluted climate controls.  No such luck, so 
I have a stupid question for those in the know:

First of all, my Vanagon has A/C but no auxiliary heater.  My question: How 
the heck do I get heat to come out of vent under the back seat?  The heat up 
front is just fine thank you, but those sitting in the back are finding 
their feet to be a bit numb.

Signed,

Cold feet in Canada
