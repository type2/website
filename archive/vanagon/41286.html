Subject: re: newsgroup

&gt; Ahhh!  I had no idea there would be so much traffic on this mailing
&gt; list. Is there any interest in switching over to a News group?  Has
&gt; this already been discussed?  I took yesterday off and had over 150
&gt; messages.

This threat inevitably comes back up.  No newsgroup.  We like it a
mailing list.

I'll second that! Just take a look at what goes on in 
rec.autos.vw.... &amp; you'll understand why. If Lloyd Parker ever found 
this list, it'd be doomed.
