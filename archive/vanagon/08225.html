&gt; 
&gt; I installed H4's on an '84 Rabid GTI I had with good results;
&gt; 
&gt; MUCH improved lighting-the fluting on the lens does an excellent job
&gt; of dispersing white light where you need it the most (immediately in
&gt; front of the car, and off to the passenger side of the road, where the
&gt; road signs typically are), and away from where you need it the least
&gt; (oncoming drivers' eyeballs).
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of caveats-check to be sure your light switch/relay can handle
&gt; the juice (if you opt for the 80/100W bulbs); my switch sort of, uhh,...
&gt; well,... let's just say I had to replace it...
&gt; I would probably recommend that you stay away from plastic lens covers
&gt; that you can get; I ended up getting cracks in both lenses (didn't
&gt; really affect performance, but still, it allows condensation w/i the 
&gt; housing.)
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, when I had 'em, they cut through the tule fog on Hwy 99 and I-5 like
&gt; a champ; I think you'll really like 'em, Thom.
