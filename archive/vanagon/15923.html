Subject: Repost: WANTED:71 Westy

I lost my beautiful 71 camper over the winter to the hazards of the 
road, and am looking to find another.  The interior and engine condition 
don't matter, but I would like to avoid as much body work (rust/dents) as 
possible.  If you have or know of a 71 westy that is available, and would 
like to see it go to a good home, please let me know.  It doesn't matter 
where it is is the U.S..
