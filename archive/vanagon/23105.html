&gt;I mounted 2 VDO guages in the VDO 3-hole bracket just between the steering

&gt;I think that's the only one I can't still see. Pretty neat, actually.
&gt;I wanted the gauges right in front of me and there they are.

Russ,
Whats on the back side of this 3-hole bracket?  Do the back of the gages and
the wires just hang out or is it enclosed somehow?
