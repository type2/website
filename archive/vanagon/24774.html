&gt; here's what i do in the tundra up here, apologies to the old timers 
&gt; that recall this thread last year.

Covering up the grille works for air-cooled VWs too.

I recall driving home from the Park City, Utah area in January.
We went around the back way through Heber City and on to I-15 south.
It was about -15 F. and the hot coffee I spilled on the dashboard froze 
before I could wipe it up.
The engine was running cold so I used Duct Tape to cover seven of the 
nine holes in the grilles at the air intakes.  With the reduced (cold) 
air intake, the engine came up to temp and ran fine.
When I got to Beaver, the snow on I-15 had melted and it was above
zero.  The duct tape came off the grilles at the fuel station.
