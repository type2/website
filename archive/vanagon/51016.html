Subject: Re: Water under back seat

&gt; Thanks everyone for you help with my propane tank problem and sticky 
&gt; locks.  Now another..  I have water under my back seat ('85 Westy&quot;)&amp; 
&gt; can't figure out where it's coming from. We recently replaced all the 
&gt; roof seals (Bus Boys-great seals!) I'm sure it's not coming from there.  
&gt; There is just a little in each channel along the sides. Any thoughts?
&gt; 
Are you sure it's water? Any smell of coolant? Leaky rear heater 
cores are quite common.
Another possibility is the fresh water tank somehow leaking -maybe 
try draining it &amp; see if the leak goes away.
