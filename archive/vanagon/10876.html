&gt;&gt;?? bentley is not much help, so i look at the exploded parts diagram ...
&gt;&gt;i don't see any 'gear box mounting bushings'. ?? do you mean those clamps
&gt;&gt;with the bolt through them?

Joel, thanks for looking up the Bentley. What I am talking about is
the rack &amp; pinion assembly that is fastened to a frame right behind the
spare tire. I looked down under the van this morning and yes it is
fasterned to the frame by FOUR bolts, two above and two below the thing. 
The Rack &amp; pinion assembly has FOUR holes with rubber bushings in the holes.
Four bolts go through these holes and fasterned it to the frame.

I think the rubbers serve as shock absorbers to protect the precision toothed
gears inside from hard vibrations. However, both my 83 and 84 show that
these rubber has shrunk and the rack &amp; pinion assembly waggles (left right
movement) when the steering wheel is turned back and forth both directions. 
This implies that the van can wander off the lane when driving against
wind. They do, both my 83 and 84 in fact love to do that.

&gt;&gt;if you mean the bushings around the bolts that hold the gear box itself to
&gt;&gt;its bracket, i would think that NO, you would not need to remove the box.

It appears to me that these bushings might be pressed in. They are supposed to
be very tight or the steering will be slopy (against wind).

&gt;&gt;if you remove the gearbox, why would you need to realign the wheels? all it
&gt;&gt;means is that your steering wheel might not be exactly horizontal ... 

To remove the assembly both left and right tie rods will have to be 
disconnected. This is why I think at least a toe-in alignment is required.
Again my question is if I need to remove the rack &amp; pinion assembly to 
replace the bushings. If yes, I am afraid an alignment (steering wheel,
and toe-in adjustment) is needed.

For vanagon owners:

Check out your rack &amp; pinion assembly of your vanagon, especially if it
tends to wander when driving against wind. Have someone rock one of the front
wheels, you will see it waggles.
