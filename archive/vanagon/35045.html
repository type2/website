Subject: Re: Fire Extinguisher Questions

&gt;The fire extinguisher I carry in the bus has expired and none of the
&gt;recharge services will fill it.  They claim new federal rules stopped that
&gt;practice a couple of years ago.  I am leery of their sales pitch for a new
&gt;one but I have no ideas what the codes mean in terms of types of fires.
&gt;Basically, what &quot;letter&quot; extinguisher should I be caring in the bus to
&gt;fight (heaven forbid) an engine fire?   My old unit is a &quot;B&quot; that I bought
&gt;at Kmart several year ago but it may have been wrong then and for the
&gt;entire time I carried it.  If someone knows, please along the information.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Skip


    &quot;A&quot; is cloth or wood fire, &quot;B&quot; oil or grease, &quot;C&quot; electrical.
     I always get an &quot;ABC&quot; but a &quot;BC&quot; would be alrighht. A type &quot;A&quot;
     is usually liquid and most uncool in electrical.
