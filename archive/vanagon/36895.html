&gt; &gt; ok, so we got YoMama who makes bras for 1950-1967 ... anybody got any
&gt; &gt; sources for bras for 1968-1979 buses, 1980-1991 vanagons, and 1991-&gt; eurovans?

West Coast Metric (1-800 247-3202) Sells Bras for all year buses
&gt; (except EVs) made by Covercraft. They even have the grille screens
&gt; included for the late model water-cooled Vanagons.
&gt; 
&gt; Also I believe Rocky Mountain Motorworks carries Wolf Bras for most year
&gt; VW's (1-800 258-1996) but I don't have the catalog in front of me at
&gt; this moment.
&gt;IMHO I don't like the look of bras on Vanagons.

&gt; 1973 Orange Superbeetle (Sport Edition)
&gt; 1981 Brown Westfalia Vanagon
&gt; 1992 Teal Jetta GL
&gt; Soon to have (1997-8) Black Concept 1
