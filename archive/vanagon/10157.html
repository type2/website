&gt;&gt; Joe's detailed parts manual.  Someone mentioned scanning, but mine's 17 pages
&gt;&gt; long and that seems kind of unwieldy:  too much disk space for all of them
&gt;&gt; on a server, too long to download, etc.  It's my suggestion we just stick to
&gt;&gt; &quot;old fashioned&quot; copies.  Maybe if we could get a list of who has what manual
&gt;&gt; for every year from, eg., '67-'79, we could put it in the FAQ?  That way
&gt;&gt; if people wanted a copy for their particular year they could just email the
&gt;&gt; appropriate person instead of one person being in charge of (and having to
&gt;&gt; deal with) all of it.  Just a suggestion.  What does everyone else think?

&gt;  I think we should xerox them and send them to Joel &quot;no shortage of shelf
&gt;  space here&quot; Walker. My guess is that he would actually read them and then
&gt;  regurgitate the pertinant facts contained within when questions come up.

YEAH!  And then we could have him set up a FAX-back system where we just
dial up and request the manual we need and it's automatically FAXed to us...
