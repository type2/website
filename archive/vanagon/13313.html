Subject: Re: optimal warmup time?*** long version***

&gt; &gt;I think we started this thread once, but I can't remember the
&gt; &gt;concensus, due to my alzheimers-senility, or whatever that disease
&gt; &gt;was I had.  Anyway, how long should I warm up my car?


	As I see it, there are two things one must worry about when 
starting their vw. 1)  engine life and 2)  environment.
 	Engine life:  The wear on the engine is greatest at start-up and 
decreases as the temp rises to that mysterious (for me) optimal operating 
temp.  Therefor, if you let the engine idle until it is fully warmed up, 
you minimize the wear caused by the rigors of accelerating a load. 
However, it also takes longer to warm up.  This means that the oil will 
not be warmed fully and contact surfaces btwn pistons/cylinders, 
mains/crank bearings, etc.. will not be properly lubed--as well, the 
contact surfaces distances from face to face are at a maximum at 
start-up which allows greater slop btwn parts. 
	Environment:  The catalytic converter and the combustion both 
require high temps to operate most efficiently.  First the cat;  this 
thing will not work when cold as the energy required to catalyze the 
conversion of hydrocarbons, COs and the others to water and O2, and?, is 
well over ambiant temps--meby 900-1200 F.  The combustion;  during warm 
up, the comustion of gas is very ineficient as it must first be 
completely atomized (a vapour) inorder to react with oxygen.  As such, 
much of the gas is going out the tail pipe and into the atmosphere--Bad.
	Fuel injection, e-control and smog controls go a long way to 
minimize this, but, the first one minute of warm up is equivilent to 14 
miles US of driving a fully warmed vehical (not my stats).
	Ergo, what do you do?  The oil that is in the contact area and 
bearings warms up very quickly as well as the surfaces themselve, the 
catalyst does not warm up nearly as fast nor does the fuel begin to 
atomize very quickly--especially on carboureted vws, so the longer you 
idle, the more you pollute (relative) and the longer idle the longer it 
takes for the engine to warm up. 
	So, I let my van warm up for 30 seconds or so then take off 
easy avoiding hills.
