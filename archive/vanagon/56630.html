Subject: Too hot or not?
Date: Fri, 28 Feb 1997 09:47:50 -0500

Thanks to all of you for the clutch help yesterday, the system had some
rather large air bubbles in it. Works like new now. My next concern is the
red light behind the coolant gauge. While the engine does get hot, the temp
has never went past the darn flashing light which at times appears to have
a mind of it's own. This morning it was on cold startup but went off after
I shut it down for about 10 seconds, only to come back on later. I have
never heard or seen the front radiator fan kick on, no matter how hot the
engine gets. Is there a way to test it and the controlling sensors? I
really love my van, and don't want to overheat it, none of the hoses or the
engine are too hot to touch. Do I just have a sensor sending false readings
or what?
