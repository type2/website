My joy was short lived.  I ran a whole bunch of errands, and it worked
perfectly every time.  Came home, parked it, putzed around for a couple
hours.  When I went to pull it in the garage, it did the same &amp;^$#_at_$!_at_$
thing again!

I think its the ignition switch: if I shake and shimmy the key, it worx.
