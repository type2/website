&gt; 	Friends,

&gt; 
&gt; 	Jean and I went up to visit my dad and step-mother a couple 
&gt; of weeks ago. Having had a very nice evening together, I felt that I
&gt; had shown or told her everything she needed to know about me, and 
&gt; asked her to marry me after we had driven back to my house. Where I actually
&gt; proposed was kneeling in the walkway betweeen the two front seats of
&gt; my brother and sister-in-law's Vanagon, which I'd traded my car for earlier
&gt; that day to haul rain gutters. :)
&gt; 

Did you consumate the engagement in the vanagon, too?
My wife of four years and I took our vanagon out for our honeymoon last
March, another vanagon romance...
