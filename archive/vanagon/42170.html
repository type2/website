KI&gt;YES!  Problem is I'll be off-line for some nine or ten days.  I'll get 

KI&gt;By the way I live some four or five miles from the Bug Out site.  Too bad 
KI&gt;I'll be gone or I could help work out stuff as the local boy...

KI&gt;bill and diane killian

Boy, does this mean bill gets to volunteer his front yard as a camping
site for anybody interested?  Everyone cooking out on his flower garden
when he gets back?  &quot;Yes friendly neighbor, I swear my good friends
bill and diane swore we could all set up our campers here, oh BTW do you
mind if some of us plug in over at your house, we got too many
in his porch outlets now, might trip a breaker, got to keep the beer
cold
and all.  Oh and you wouldn't mind if we use your uh, facilities now
and then
would you?&quot;
