Subject: Re: backfire!

could backfire result from air leaking past the intake gaskets?  I had
to remove the intake manifolds to get at the generator.  I did install
new gaskets.  I tried tightening the manifold bolts to an even torque-
though this was a guestimate at best since these nuts are difficult to
get at in my van ('65 deluxe with a '73 DP 1600).   christian
