Normal intuitive logic would dictate that this is correct but.....we are
talking about them funny looking furrin' boxes with the engine in the
wrong end!
 Our 85 had a similar symptom. After it was stalled (accidental rapid
release of clutch), it would crank and crank without starting. This would
also be accompanied by LOTS of gas fumes. To start it we would fully
depress the accelerator and then start cranking it.  The last repair I
remember doing, before the problem stopped, was oiling the advance
mechanism in the distributor. My theory is that the action of stalling
the motor, jammed the advance full on. This was too much (advance) to
allow the motor to start. Hence the flooding. By holding the peddle to
the floor you activated the full enrichment switch, which is parallel to
the idle position switch. Hence the brain thought it was still in the
idle position . This allowed extra air in to help with the excess fuel.
That's my story and I'm sticking with it!

PS Check the timing when it is starting correctly and compare it to when
it does not.

&gt;Phil, I'm not an expert, but I believe depressing the accelator to the

&gt;you want to keep your foot off the gas pedal. At any rate there is a
&gt;problem that I'm sure some one on the list can explain in detail.
