 &gt; Perhaps many of you already know of this site, but I was just
 &gt; clued into it, and was so impressed, I felt like sharing  :)
 &gt; 
 &gt; It's:  http://www.altavista.digital_dot_com
 &gt; 
 &gt; and is apparently the largest web index ever. 

It's a killer search engine, no question, but be aware the index hasn't been 
updated since December.  I talked to some of the guys who run it a day or two 
ago, and they get a query every 15 *milliseconds*.  The *index* file is 40 
gigabytes, and takes about half an hour just to *copy*, let alone rebuild.

They're getting some more hardware to make redundant servers so they can yank 
one, rebuild the index, and then swap in the new server.  Yow, bigtime stuff 
here.

Still *very* useful, especially for finding stuff you sent to mailing lists 
andhoped had disappeared long ago :-)
