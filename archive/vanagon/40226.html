Subject: Oil _at_##_at_$_at_Light on 

Hi all. I have finally gotten new plugs and a cap, rotor , coil and wires
into Seigfried. The reasons are long and not needed now. Anyway, he sat for
about a month while this took place. Now, I still have a hard start/crummy
running problem, but I am pretty sure that is the throttle area that needs
to be cleaned as per some previous posts. But the blasted oil light comes
on above 3000 rpm. It did not before. I put on a Mann filter(for real
vanagons) and that did not do it. Any thoughts as to why it was fine, then
sat, now the blasted (this is a family list) now comes on!!  am losing my
remaining hair. TIA
