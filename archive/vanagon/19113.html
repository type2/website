Subject: Vanagon Bentley Manual

When I bought my 84 Vanagon in 1985 I also bought the Bentley manual which
covers 80  through 84.  I think it has grown in size through the years.  My
question is: Would the later versions give my any more info about my 84
model?  My manual seems a little weak in some areas especially concerning the
water cooled engine.
Thanks    Bob
