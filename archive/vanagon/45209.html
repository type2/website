Subject: 71 Westy Seat Back Covers

Does anyone have for sale the back covers, for the front seats, for a
1971 Westy? They are the creme,tan color. My seats bottoms are pretty
good,but the backs are both patched in the corners as you get in.
Everytime my wife and I get in &quot;Chili&quot; we are reminded of the ugly at
just below eye level. Can anyone help &quot;deugly&quot; my seats' backs? Thanks
for your help and consideration.
