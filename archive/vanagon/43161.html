Subject: T-Shirts are Here!!!!!!!

Howdy all, this is probably my last post. You know how everything comes
together at the last minute, well, the list shirts FINALLY got back from the
printer today, and we're leaving tomorrow. So, I'll have them out in the mail
tomorrow morning. Look for them sometime next week. Thanks to everyone who
ordered, and if you missed out, who knows, I will probably be back sometime,
and do some more.
thanks to everyone, and I'll be seeing some of you lucky people on the road!
Many Thanks
peace,
Richard
