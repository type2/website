&gt;My exhaust system is shot and I need to locate some pieces. Everything from
&gt;the heater boxes back needs to be replaced and I've found most of the stuff.
&gt;The problem is that the crossover pipe is over $500!!!!! My Vanagon is an
'82
&gt;and looking over parts lists and such it looks like the pipe from a '79 Bus
&gt;is the same and it is half the price. Does anyone know the difference or
&gt;where I can get the pipe for less? Any advice would be great. E-mail me
&gt;direct if you would, and thanks in advance.

I belive your van has the O2 sensor.  If so, the pipe is not interchangeable
with the 79.  The right side heater box flange is also different.  If you
repalce the pipe, make sure the hangers are there to support the wieght.  If
not, the pipe will crack again.
