Subject: More tire considerations for Vanagon. (Works for Bus too)

Two more tire to consider for van.  Pirelli P400 APT.  The APT stands for all
purpose tire.  It is available in both 205 and 215/70-14.  I thas a real nice
raised white outline letter sidewall and look like it would work very well on
Syncro.  The load rating is 96T. (1554lbs _at_ 35psi, 118mph)

Michelin MX-4 should be an excelent rain/touring tire.  205 is raised black
letters, 215 is white wall.  the 205 s rated 95T.(1490lbs), The 215 is rated
96S,(112 mph).
