Subject: RE: Quality of Whitney parts


&gt;Someone once mentioned that they might be working on a list of parts
&gt;that are reported to be good from JCWhitney.

Hope he has lots of time to maintain this list-- on some parts, JCW
changes suppliers every other day, and quality can change accordingly.


&gt;I would like to
&gt;see some positive and negative recommendations about what can safely
&gt;be ordered from JCW and what cannot.

I got a convertible top for a '66 Mustang from them, Three years later
it's still solid.

Also got their 300W 4ch amp. When it arrived, it said 225W. Worked fine,
though, till I made the mistake of driving it with a &quot;high-power&quot; stereo,
whose outputs regularly swing below ground. Oops!

Two years later, ordered another 300W amp, hoping the product now matched
the ad. It didn't-- was exactly the same 225W jobber. Still worked fine.

Their folding 8x4 trailer kit makes a terrific trailer-- I highly
recommend it. Buy a light kit as long as you're paying their shipping
charges already.

JCW's heater boxes had no radiating fins inside several years ago when
I ordered some. Fine for California summers   :(

They have a fine selection of round 7&quot; headlights that bolt into your
VW-- from incandescents to standard halogens thru to replacable-bulb
eyeball-sizzlers. I've never had a problem with any of them.

My $.02
