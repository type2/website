 Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the '78 the best year for the late type
 II's (I know that's hard to say without comment).  I say that based on the
 availablility of the 2.0 engine during these years.  I understand that the
 hydraulic lifters are a benefit as well the exhaust system (which is still
 fairly easy to find vs. the '79 version).  I'm assuming that the version of
 automatic transmission used was improved from the first version a few years
 previous (just a guess).  I have been told that the fuel injection on the
 later models is also a benefit over the earlier buses.  If these are points
 of debate, please let me know (as well as any other suggestions you may
 have).  Around here buses are hard enough to come by and I want to make sure
 I get the best year I can.



  I'd say a good part of the reputation for desireability that the '78 bus
  has is based on the hydraulic lifters, for which '78 was the first year. 
  However, any type IV engine can be upgraded to hydraulics and many have
  as they were rebuilt. Some folks prefer the sliding side windows over
  the earlier &quot;vent wing&quot; type too.  I wouldn't put too much emphasis on
  the exhaust system since some '75-'78 exhaust parts aren't particularly
  easy to come by and expensive when you do. The pre '75 exhaust system,
  shared with the European market buses, is simpler and parts are still
  available.  

  To answer you basic question about which is the best year, my reply is
  something of a sidestep. My opinion is that these vehicles are all so 
  old now that the condition of what you are considering far outweighs the
  subtleties of the year to year changes. And as I pointed out with the
  hydraulic lifters, you can often fit a desireable feature from one year
  to another. Some caveats: If you are considering a westy, get the camper
  layout you want - the campers changed a lot more than the buses did. It
  doesn't sound like you are considering earlier buses with the type I engine,
  but that would be another thing to have your mind made up on in advance of
  shopping. 

  Finding a sound, straight, body with a minumum of rust is probably your
  best bet as a first priority - all the other stuff is much easier to 
  fix up to your liking.
