Subject: DMV Saga - Almost Over!

Howdy!

	Well, my travails with DMV are almost over.  I got my Historical
Vehicle Plates today - 712E is the number.  I wonder what my chances would
be of getting one for the Porsche that was 991T?

	Anyway, I say _almost_ over because I can still get a refund of some
of the $$$ I paid, but I have to do some legwork.
