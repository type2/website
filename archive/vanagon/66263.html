Subject:      CV Joint Frustrations

Listees,
I'm trying to replace two of the CV joints and four of the boots on the
rear axle of my '86 Syncro Westfalia.
How do I separate the CV joint from the shaft? I have removed the
circlip and tried both methods of separation: 1) used a drift and hammer
on the inner part of the CV joint to drive it off of the shaft and 2)
used a drift and hammer to drive the shaft through the CV joint. I got
1/16 inch movement and then nothing more. Should I just persist and
swear louder? Should I find a hydraulic press? What am I doing wrong?
Did I miss something?

I'm frustrated and about to give up on this CV joint project. Larry :-(
