&gt;You ever get heat in your bus?
&gt;
&gt;I bought the Thermal Systems but have never installed it and have pretty
&gt;much now decided to sell it and get a conventional propane furnace (mounted
&gt;where the small lower cabninet is).

This one factor is the only thing that held me back from putting in this
Termal Systems heater so I haven't bought one yet. I simply cannot come to
terms with where it might be installed. In the meantime, I rigged up some
Coleman Black Cat heaters (discontinued now) to use propane from the
existing tank. I screw these portable heaters into the propane system when I
want heat and move them around on the floor to wherever I want them
positioned at the moment. I can even move them up into the top bunk if I
want. They are not vented though, and after about 10 hours I notice my
carbon monoxide detectors go off even if I leave the window open. 

&gt;I could never find a place for the Thermal Systems heater that wouldn't
&gt;significantly compromise our use of the van. I'd also be constantly worried
&gt;that my dog would set herself on fire.
&gt;
&gt;Do you have any reccomendations on a furnace?

Some people on the list have claimed that you can install a conventional
furnace in place of the little utility closet to the rear of the
refrigerator but I have never found a model of modest amp draw (or even high
amp draw) that fits in that place. Cannot figure out which heater they are
talking about.

Gotta make posts to the list to flush these people out or disprove the
rumor. Martha's been harking in this direction, so gotta see what she found out.

&gt;Hope things are going well.

Quite well for me though it has taken some time to adjust to all the changes
in the marketplace. This Internet thing is a wild and wooly ride, as
everybody from Microsoft to Prodigy to AT&amp;T to Murdoch is finding out, much
to their dismay. The whole thing is playing in to my hands, though I have no
announcements at this time.

Glad to hear from you again. Too bad about the heater. I admire Dave Garth's
setup. Seen his web pictures?
