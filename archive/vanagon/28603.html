Mitch,

I didn't mean to set your hair on fire.  You're the mechanic-in-charge,  the
person closest to the task.  Whatever your decision, once it's made I'll back
you up ...  within reason :-) so long as I know you're aware of the options
and consequences.

Please accept my apology for the smart-ass content of my post.  

-Bob
