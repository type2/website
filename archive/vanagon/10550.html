Howdy y'all!

	I can now, with a straight face, say my bus is roadworthy.

	This past weeked I put on a new steering dampner, and front shocks,
and I prettied up the front wheel wells.  I also installed mud flaps -
and impulse purchase that I couldn't resist!  BTW - I welded the brackets
for the mud flaps on, and once I've got everything together, I'll rivet
the flaps to the bracket.

	(BTW _ I put on KYB GR-2 shocks on the front.  I put the cheap
stock-type ones on the back.  I'll prolly wanna get the GR-2's in
the back someday soon.

	Saturday I got a set of used Michelin MVX's/MVX whatevers, 185/65's,
which are a little meatier than the 5.15's I had on the fron of it
before.  Strangely enough, those old bias ply tires have a lot of good  
tread on them! (I kept the old tires to avoid the $5/tire &quot;disposal fee&quot;
which really means put them on the shelf and sell them to someone else.

	Last Friday I made another attempt at getting it registered, and it
looks like I was sucessful.  I now have a nice red number &quot;3&quot; on my back 
window.

	I even Rain-Ex's the windsheilds!

	Now you know you're a fanatic, when you drive your 
911 in the rain rather than get your new undercoating on the bus wet!
