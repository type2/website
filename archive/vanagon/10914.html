&gt;I have to agree with Sami.  There is nothing that will screw up a job
&gt;like cheap tools.  Those $4 socket sets are not worth ...
&gt;...                          Mac and Snap On are the best, but they are
&gt;really, really, REALLY expensive and you can't find them in stores.
&gt;Craftsman tools are almost as good and available at a Sears near you for
&gt;a lot less.  Crew-Line (Checker Shucks/Kragen) have a lifetime warranty
&gt;but they still break!  Okay in a pinch, though...

a word in your shell-like ear: be SURE that the stuff you buy at Sears
says 'Craftsman' on it ... otherwise, you get NO warranty of any sort.

while Sears Craftsman tools are not as good as they once were (imho), they
are still very good for home use. and the Sears stores don't move around a
lot (like the Mac and Snap-on dealer trucks!) ... and most of them stay open
til 9:00pm and on Sundays.  so, for the money and convenience, it's a pretty
good set of tools.
