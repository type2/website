Subject:      Air flow Sensor  85 Vanagon

With the cover off the air flow sensor the arm jumps around, but when I close

off the crarkcase breather tube by pinching it the arm becomes relativly
steady.
Is this normal, or am I just off my feed.LOVE  MY VANAGON but it always needs
something.  Thanks for list and help.
