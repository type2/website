Subject: insulation for Westy pop top


In a German Westfalia catalogue I saw a neat piece which goes around the 
tent part of the open pop top. It's like a large blanket or something 
which helps insulate the open top in cold weather. Trouble is, they want 
close to 600 Marks for it, about $ 400. 
Does anybody know if that part is available in the States, from an 
aftermarket supplier perhaps? Or, even better, does anybody want to sell 
me a use one? I am also looking for one of those guards for the top bed that 
prevent pillows (and kids =:O) from falling down.

Thx,
Joerg
