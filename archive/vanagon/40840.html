[Classifieds from Hemmings not quoted]

Maybe it's my imagination, but these seem to average out higher with each
succeeding month. I'm noticing it in the classifieds in the local paper,
too--aircooled prices are going through the roof. Right now there is an
*incomplete* '73 Beetle project (not a vert) asking $2500 in there, and an
early Squareback asking $3500 (!). This is not a VW town, either.

Is anybody else noticing this or is it just a pretense of mine? ;) Maybe
we're getting fashionable? If we are I will have to sell both of mine out
of disgust.
