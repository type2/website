Busses By The Arch (to the tune of &quot;Battle of New Orleans&quot;)

On Labor Day Weekend we took a little trip
     Along with all the Busses to the mighty Mississip'
We took a little tuna and some old magnesium
     To meet our fellow Bus-Folk in the town of O'Fallon

Well..we...arrived quite early and the Busses kept a comin'
     There's more here now than there was a while ago
And pretty soon they all began a runnin'
     On a long caravan to the river (which was low)

So they loaded the Splitties
     And they loaded the Breadloaves
     And they loaded the Bricks
          (Tho' some, they would not go)
They pushed them all aboard that little ferry
     Bound to cross the river (Break the record? Sorry, no)

Once we got across the river and onto higher ground
     We circled 'round Bill Bowman and said &quot;Lead us back to town!&quot;
Our gauges and our dash lights, tho' they do not make a sound
     Are busy trying to tell us, &quot;Your cores, they're melting down&quot;

Well...he...told us not to worry -- that the trip was nearly over
     We're going to have a picnic and it's sure to be &quot;Big Fun&quot;
We'll vote for all our favorites, as they're parked out in the clover
     And the drive back will be cooler (from the setting of the Sun)

So they jumped in the Splitties
     And they jumped in the Breadloaves
     And they jumped in the Bricks
          (Even water-cooled's were parched)
They headed back toward the campground in O'Fallon
     To have more fun at Busses By The Arch
