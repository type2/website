Subject: Really COLD starts

Hi all.

I'm waiting for the weather to warm up so I can do some work on my van
(install used engine).  It's been too cold to start working outside ( -41
before wind chill (yes minus 41 degrees)).  I live in Northern Ontario
Canada.  40 below is 40 below celcius, farenheit, same thing.  It was only
a couple of days, but we usually get about a week of that stuff near the
end of January.

The first year I had my van (85 transporter), I was coming home from work
at about 5 am, 40 below and my oil light came on.  I pulled over to find my
oil all up my back door and in a puddle underneath.  Scared the heck out of
me but it ended up it was only the oil filter gasket had blown out.  Quick
change that afternoon and all was well.  I still had to walk home though (3
miles).


Anyone know what weight of oil is recommended when hell freezes over?


There was some talk of block heaters on the list a while back.  I couldn't
live without one.  My 74 transporter had one as well.  Every bug I ever
bought had one too.  They are actually &quot;oil heaters&quot; on the air cooled
ones, and the water cooled one is the same only bigger.  It basically is an
element in an aluminum block that bolts to the bottom of your motor and
keeps things toasty.

When I first got my water cooled it didn't have one (I bought the van in
Southern Ontario).  A cold snap set in and I was stranded.  To get to the
dealer to buy a block heater (an hour away) I had to use an old trick my
grandfather used to use when he worked in the bush.  When the skidders and
dozers wouldn't start, they would light a fire underneath.  Not so
dramatic, I filled an enamel pan with hot coals from the wood stove and
propped it up on boards until it was close enough to just warm my bottom
(my engine bottom ;~)  ).  After three hours and a bunch of refills, old
unfaithful sputtered to life.

I thought that this is maybe what caused my filter gasket to go, but almost
on the exact same day, one year later, and almost in the exact spot. . .
(play twilight zone music now)  it happened again.  It was later in the day
and I got a ride that time.  I was even using lighter oil.  How light can I
go at 40 below?

The next year the van was parked for January, and this year I'm replacing
the engine, so I don't have to worry, but we still have a couple of months
of winter left.  If anyone has cold weather experience with their vans or
any recommendations, let haul, I'ld like to hear from you.

And does Propex make an industrial size heater? Ha, kidding. My BA6 will
melt plastic (left a cassette by the floor vent).


Thanks

still looking at an 86 syncro

Does really cold weather affect VC operation in a Syncro?
Any other list members live in the North?
