&gt; I got the Bentley manual and lo and behold there is an idle adjusting 
&gt; screw!  I had assumed that since the idle was digitally stabilized that 
&gt; it would not be adjustable.  I have since trurned the screw a couple of 
&gt; full turns counter-clockwise and the idle is back to spec.
&gt; 
&gt; I figured that the next thing would be that it would not idle at 
&gt; start-up.  So far no problem.  Now it hasn't really gotten very cold down 
&gt; here (Atlanta) yet so I may have some cold start problems or rough idle 
&gt; on warm up when it does but right now it seems to be working fine.
&gt; 
&gt; I did notice something on cold start that my Jetta used to do (also an 
&gt; '85 model) the OXS and Alternator LED lights do not go out until you rev 
&gt; the engine above 1000rpm, something I have always heard is not a problem 
&gt; and has been corrected in later models.
&gt; 
&gt; I do plan on changing out the O2 sensor and changing the oil and coolant 
&gt; when I get back from vacation over Thanksgiving.  The coolant is, of 
&gt; course, bright green.  I just hope I can find all those bleeding screws 
&gt; and get enough coolant in without the air pockets.  Will be reading the 
&gt; manual and the FAQ carefully.
&gt; 
&gt; The only other problems I'm having are with the starter solenoid, 
&gt; occasionally it is not engaging the starter and the front end squeaks a 
&gt; bit and I here this when manoevering into parking spaces--this seems to 
&gt; be coming from the steering.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, the mileage isn't as bad as I thought it would be--getting around 
&gt; 17mpg in town with some freeway driving.  Looks like I'll just have to 
&gt; get used to that, the Passat gets around 24 in town and 35 on the 
&gt; highway.  I suppose I expected a little better out of the Vanagon.--

I am unsure exactly if your model year has one; but in order to PROPERLY
adjust the idle you must first bypass the idle  stabilizer (green or black
box beside igniter). To do this you must remove both plugs from the
stabilizer and connect them together. Otherwise any attempts at adjustment
will be improper...and you may experience fluctuations in idle speed.  DC
(also proper idle adjustment should be done with a timing light and tach). DC
