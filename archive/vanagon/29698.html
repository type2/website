Subject: 21 windows-a-rolling 

    I had a '67 21 window a few years ago and my bus would 
intermitently roll.
    Once I parked it on a hill in a residential area and  a friend and 
I went to a friend's house for about 15 min.  He and I started to walk 
back to the bus and on the way we noticed the bus was coming to us.  
Now this street had cars parked pertty densly on it (otherwise I would 
have parked closer).  As she picks up momentum I start running for 
cover.  All of a sudden the bus veered to the right, in between some 
parked cars, right for the living room of a house; and crack it hits a 
tree, thank god.  Now here is the cool part; the bus hit the tree on, 
in my humble estimation, the best possible spot, on the front bumper 
where there is the vertical bumper from which the tubular piece comes 
(well you try to describe it!)... Just a ding (:D 

    The moral:  Never get your bus alligned so when it rolls it will 
miaculously miss everything, or, fix the brake before you live the rest 
of your life wishing you did because you killed someone.  This 
experience is darkly funny, honestly it scaerd the shit out of me.

portholes nor a priceless sun roof.
