Subject: Re: Oregon Bashing

Regarding Oregon bashing.  The other day I saw someone's comments about how
they couldn't understand why we won't let people pump their own gas in Oregon.
One of the reasons we keep the &quot;safety&quot; regulation on the books that
prohibits individuals from pumping their own gas is that we Oregonians don't
want ourselves or our guests to this state to have to get out of their cars
and deal with the smelly (fumes) business of pumping one's own gas.

Not only that but we don't have any of those ridiculous self-serve stations
where you need to get out of your car (hopefully in the rain) and give
someone sitting in a cashiers window a deposit in order to activate the gas
pump should you wish to pay cash.  Not only that but for some reason Oregon
doesn't have a sales tax.  Yet another reason why Oregon is a nice place to
visit.

So the next time you see someone with a cigarette in one hand and a gas pump
handle in the other drive away quickly to Oregon.  Oh yes, gasoline doesn't
cost any more in Oregon than it does in Washington or California.

&gt;I interpret all (or at least most) of this as &quot;all in good fun&quot;.  The great
&gt;thing about life is we are all intitled to our own interpretation....
