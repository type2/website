Subject: Snow!!!!!


On the way back to the ol' lab tonight I saw something that
britghten my somewhat dismal week....

My poor Van has been sitting at home all alone waiting for me
to come back and put a new engine in it, so I took particular joy in
this.

Some 20something preppy little puke had gotten his CRX stuck in 
the 6 inches of snow that was in his driveway.  One of his friends
was leaning on a shovel watching him spin the tires off trying
to rock free of the drift.  Another was making sure he didn't
get hit by traffic.

On a bad day, a Volkswagen would have never gotten stuck in this :)
And secondly, why didn't they shovel him out?  Living in the country
taught us to always have a shovel, and be prepared to use it............

Also, to Mr. Wright:
	Is there some guy out in the middle of nowhere that has some kind
of VW shop?  We saw one when we took Hwy92? to Council Bluffs on a bike
trip a few years ago(camped out in Indianola)

Gloatingly yours,
Matt
