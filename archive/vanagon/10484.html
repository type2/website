in tom's defense, the gender confusion is due to the fact that the address
he is using is that of his &quot;partner&quot; (is that the p.c. term to use?)

&gt;This is just a little confusing with a guy named Tom posting with the
&gt;name of Rachel.  How did your parents dress you?  Gender confusion
&gt;aside, I too would like a sample copy of your newsletter.

&gt;Echoing a couple of previous posts I too welcome you officially to the
&gt;freak house.  :)
&gt;
&gt;P.S.  Thom, we all still love you AND your '56, even if it isn't the
&gt;oldest on the list anymore.  Make that twice, there is that guy in Oz
&gt;that hasn't figured out to get that '54 home.  :)
