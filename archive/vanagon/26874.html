&gt;         Is ONE DAY PAINT any good or do you have a better suggestion.

&gt;         against peeling, fading etc. including my bumpers and wheels
&gt;         for $600.00.  What do you think?

    Have they SEEN the bus? My wife gave my a gift certificate
    for paint a year or so back, I was not impressed at all with
    the quality of the paint. It looks good superficially (and
    thank God it's not that weird yellow color any more) but
    I think I'd be a lot more inclined to take a day off and
    head to Tijuana for cheaper work of the same quality...
