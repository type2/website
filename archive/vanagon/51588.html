Subject: Re: Sacramento VW Shop?

A Sacramento Vanagon Engine place?  You kidding?  Check AVP.  There has
been so much discussion over whether you should have AVP or Mark Stephens
do your mail-order rebuilds, with the consensus coming to AVP, that it
seems crazy, living in the same place, to consider anything else.  Anybody
have problems with AVP? (Did I screw up the name?)  They really love you
to take your whole car to them for the work, even though they also
mail-order (at least they did a year ago).
