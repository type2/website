Subject: Chrome bumpers

-- 
MZsI must apologise to the list for  a slight error I made when I
announced that I had two new bumpers for sale. 
I do have them, but they are both front bumpers!
They are brand new, but I do not have the rubber strips.
I will sell them for $100.00 plus shipping charges.
             Thanks,  Jay
