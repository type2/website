&gt; Hey:
&gt; 
&gt; Well the time to move out to calif. is soon upon us and we realized 
&gt; we had nowhere to put the bikes. My question is, is there a bike rack 
&gt; that we can use for the Vanagon (84). I looked at the top mounted 
&gt; racks, but they were tooo expensive (or I'm too cheap) and the 
&gt; thought of battling Midwestern Wind gusts with an extra 3 feet of 
&gt; &quot;Sail&quot; didn't sound to  good. Area there any that will fit on the 
&gt; hatch area?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

I oicked up a Kmart special about a year ago.  One of the strap on the
car's trunk variety.  This bike rack rides ok on the front of my 85 Westy
and great on the back.  My wife (of 4 years) and I took our honeymoon in
the van with two bike riding on the back.  This rack does not interfere
with the operation of the rear hatch(If you don't mind lifting the extra
weight)
Price for this jewel.  About $28.
