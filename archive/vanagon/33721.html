Subject: Brake drum removal.

Chances are you have a lip on the inside of the drum.  The brake pad will not
move past this lip.  Try this to remove stuck brake drums.

1.  Use WD-40, or the like, and spray on thouroughly.  Use compressed are to
blow the WD-40 into crevices.  Repeat a couple of times.  Let sit overnight.
 Then try turning the star wheel.

2.  Use a hammer-puller.  It bolts on to the lug nuts and the handle slids
back and forth.  As you slam the hammer back a few times, it will pull the
drum off.

Good Luck.
