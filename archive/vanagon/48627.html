Subject: Re: Use of Tow Dolly to Move a Vanagon

Jim, my syncro owners manual warns not to tow with 2 or 4 wheels on the
ground.i would fear some damage to the viscous unit due to the fact that the
rear wheels will not be supplying the torque to the coupling but rather they
would be driven by the front?Just a thought.The 2wd vanagon has no
problems...Ive towed mine on all 4s for 400mi or more.
