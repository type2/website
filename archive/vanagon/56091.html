Subject: Re: Bike rack over rear window? 

&gt;&gt;Also, it came with a Yakima bike rack that has the support braces resting
&gt;&gt;on the rear *window*. Don't know if I like that.... Has anyone had


I use a Rhode Gear rack on the rear hatch. It works same/fine, aside from
access, but I really don't like having the rack and bikes hanging off two 1&quot;
wide nylon straps.  Maybe it's different mount from the Yakima?  I've also
had it up front, resting on bumper and strapped onto front body.  Better
mount but bike wheels are TOO close to ground for driveway ramps etc.  Bye, Tim
