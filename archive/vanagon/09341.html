Has anyone had any experience using synthetic oil
in their manual transmission? I have an '87
Westfalia and I'm thinking about using Redline MTL.

Redline also makes a product called Water Wetter that
is supposed to reduce friction in your cooling system
so that the engine cools more efficiently. Anyone
tried this?

I use Redline in the transmission of my everyday car
and it has improved the shifting, especially on very cold 
mornings.
