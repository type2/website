Subject: Re: Speaking of Windshield Wipers...

I put trico snow blades on and found out they don't work very well at
high speeds, over 60 MPH.  I didn't have that problem with the regular
bosch blades.

If you haven't done so already, put Rain-X on, it really works.  I drove
my ex 70 westy for months with a dead wiper motor through downpours with
no problem even at night.

&gt; Mine SUCK!  (Pardon my French, Phillippe)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm real dissappointed in the windshield wipers in both my 87 and 88
&gt; Vanagons.  They seem to smear, or chatter or both and just do a poor job in
&gt; general.
&gt; I've swithced wipers by replacing the assembly sometimes and replacing just
&gt; the rubber insert at other times.  I've tried Anco, Trico (sp?) and right now
&gt; I've got fancy &quot;Tripledge&quot; wipers installed that have multiple ridges on each
&gt; wiper - supposed to be made of silicon for ultimate wiping.  They're just as
&gt; bad as the rest.  They do have a lifetime replacement warranty though.  Just
&gt; send in the wiper and about $8 for S+H and they'll send you a new $10 wiper!!
&gt; Some warranty!
&gt; 
&gt; I've checked to see that the wiper sits square against the glass, it does.  I
&gt; also theorized that the wiper wasn't pressing against the glass hard enough,
&gt; so I removed the arm and shortened up the spring attachment clip to get a
&gt; little more spring tension.  This did not help.
&gt; 
&gt; No, I'm not just overly wiper-sensitive, I've driven in plenty of cars where
&gt; I rate the wipers as just fine, but not my Vanagons'.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt;
