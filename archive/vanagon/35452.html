    Thu, 15 Feb 1996, thorsland_at_bigvax.alfred_dot_edu asks:
    &gt;Has anyone out there been able to go  
    &gt;one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
    &gt;without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?

Had this baby for 8 years and there must have
been a &quot;good year&quot; mustn't there?

In the past year I've had to drop the engine
to replace the heads because the bolts rotted
off and the exhaust system disconnected.

Right now, I'm waiting for an axle beam...
