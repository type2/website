Subject: propane toilet!


Saw this on my boat mailing list, and thought it might be of
interest to some of you:

 I'm not sure this will help but:  Storburn International Inc., 200 Lee 
Ave., PO.O. Box 521, Paris, Ontario N3L 3T6.....Tel: 519-442-4731 Fax 
519-442-7551.

Produces a propane fired toilet &quot;system&quot; - dessigned for cottage, cabin, 
mobile shelters, etc...as per the brochure...it is self contained and all 
you need is a vent and hookup to a propane tank.

the model i have a brochure for....model 60k specs are listed below.  I'm 
not sure if this system is adaptible to all boats but should IMHO work 
fine for some with a bit of space.
Top of unit is approx chest height.
Unit Dimensions:  17 3/4&quot; x 31 1/4&quot; floor area, standard seat height.
Unit Weight:      approx 170 lbs. (may be a big factor for boats)
shipping carton dimensions:  approx 20&quot; x 33&quot; x 55&quot;
chamber capacity:   3 gals
gas rating: 40,000 btu 
standard gas control and connection
flue connection: 6&quot; male collar. standard taper
ignition:  piezo type 


This type of system is &quot;supposedly&quot; approved by the Canadian Govt. 
meeting sanitation and safety codes.

The price sheet is from 1992:  # 60 KP storburn toilet....2150.00 (US).

As described in brochure: Storburn pollution free toilet.
no electricity, no water, no holding tanks, no plumbing, no moving parts, 
no freeze up, burns either propane or natural gas.
Sanitary:  the toilet reduces untreated human waste to sterile mineral 
ash and harmless water vapor. because each incinerator cycle sterilizes 
the entire storage chamber destroying all odor causing bacteria, the 
chamner never requires washing.

Guarteed odorless: design eliminates foul odor problems that are 
characteristic of other systems. written guarantee &quot; toilet gives off no 
foul odors inside or outside.

Non polluting - toilet is self contained and does not discharge any 
effluent into the soil or harmful gas into the atmosphere. all remains 
after incinerator cycle is sterile ash.

efficiency - under ideal operating cnditions a full 100# propane cylinder 
will burn 16 max capacity loads (approx 600-960 loads) depending on 
ambient temperaturs, ration of solids to liquids and other variable 
factors. More efficient to burn full loads rather than partial as takes 
virtually the same amout of fuel to preheat the combustion chamber under 
all load conditions.   Can be installed in virtually any heated or 
unheated building

Capaicity: can be used 40 to 60 times in succession before incineration 
is neccessary.  

Operation: add packet of anti-foam, close and lock unit, light pilot,
automatic shut off at end of cycle.  burner cannot be activiated while
unit is in use. system must be closed and locked before incineration can
take place.  cycle takes up to 4 1/2 hours if chamber is full. 

forgive my long winded reprint but thought some of you might be intereste 
din this product.  The organization i work with (the Hudson River 
Waterway Association) is considering something along this line to open a 
wilderness campsite on a ecologically sensitive island.
