Subject: bug o' rama report

        Bug O' Rama was &quot;ok.&quot;

        We went the night before and camped out ($25 to get in w/camping!)
and so O got first dibs on a lot of stuff.  Bought a set of deluxe trim,
including the short piece, another set of '51 plates, and a mish-mash of
other stuff.

        Up bright and early the next day.  Went on an orgasmic spending
frenzy.  Bough: NOS fuel reserve tap, NOS barndoor reflectors, 25 hp oil
filler, 2 H4 headlamps, ambulance fan, crank-start crank and nut, a couple
very early jesus handles, a set of NOS deluxe trim end caps (haven't even
been drilled), NOS barndoor cargo latch, barndoor starter button, DKP
accessory light, safari window shafts, 1-eyed duck, and a few other misc stuff.

        Stuff-I-wanted-but-ran-out-of-money: NOS bus semaphores($400);
Blaupunkt picnix radio (1 for $250, 1 for $400)

        Stuff-I-wanted-but-the-guy-was-on-glue-and-wanted-too-much-money:
NOS barndoor rear apron, missing the tab for the latch, and dented a little
bit ($500!)

        Briefly checked out the car show; only 1 bus there that even got my
attention: a 1955 fire truck.  It was barndoor in the front end, with a
later back end (factory, not hacked), ambulance hatch, ribbed semaphores
(why?) and other cool gadgets, including the 36hp pump, hose, and a
westfalia trailer!  Nice looking car from a ways back, but when you get up
close, a lousy &quot;restoration.&quot;  I don't see why, if you pay $10k for a car,
then go to restore it, you can be too cheap to spring for new window rubber,
and instead get paint all over it...

        Drag racing types were kept amused by 2 wrecks, due to the wind.  I
thought the earth would tip the way everyone rushed to the track side when
the heard him crash.  I did my part for world stability and helped hold down
the other side...
