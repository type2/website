&gt; Hello Michael,
&gt;
&gt; You wrote, about patching window holes cut into a van:
&gt;
&gt; The 'panel' is actually the skin part of a complex of vertical and horizontal
&gt; ribs spot welded to the panel.  If you try to take the whole panel out, you
&gt; will also have to cut or chisel out every one of the spot welds on both donor
&gt; vehicle and your van -- not a job to be undertaken lightly.  The alternative
&gt; could be to weld in just the parts that have been cut away, or to put in
&gt; somewhat larger patch(es) that make it easier to hide the seams.  It is going
&gt; to take a lot of labor to make the patches invisible.
&gt;
&gt; I have a '65 camper conversion on a van body.  It is fairly nicely done, and
&gt; the camper windows are stainless instead of aluminum, but the windows are
&gt; just shoved into pretty ragged holes cut in the van's sides, and I have
&gt; thought seriously about patching in regular bus window openings.  I have the
&gt; parts to do the job, but haven't taken the plunge, yet.  I guess one
&gt; horizontal seam line should go on the belt bulge.  Maybe we could hide the
&gt; upper horizontal seam just under the rain gutter molding.
&gt;

I think this depends on the person's skills with welding, as to whether he
should do it or not (or have it done professionally).

Taking out the entire panel would be a lot of work, but can be made simpler
by:  carefully determine excactly the limits of the panel, and cut it out
within its edges, leaving a spot welded &quot;rind&quot; of the panel in place.  This
gives you easier access to the spot welds that might be hard to get at.  I
wouldn't chisel the panel out OR the spot welds.  I'd use a sawzall (or
other brand equivalent) to hack the panel out (thus not deforming the
surrounding metal), then use a drill and bit just larger than the spot
welds to drill them out (or most of them, sometimes you have to finish it
off with a couple taps with a chisel).  This will minimize deforming the
metal the panel attaches to that remains with the van.  When you cut the
replacement panel out of the wrecked van, cut into the area OUTSIDE the
edges of the panel, and do the same drilling of spot welds at home as you
did before.  All these &quot;extra&quot; steps may sound like a lot of work, but it's
well worth it.

If you have some welding experience, it's not too difficult to make &quot;new&quot;
spot welds by welding through the drill holes, preferably with a wire arc
welder, but doable with a gas welder if you're careful not to overheat the
panel (this can be pretty hard, though).

I've done a few &quot;patch&quot; jobs on various of my own cars in the past,
including buses.  I've ALWAYS found it much easier to replace the entire
panel as above (unless the damage is relatively minor) than to patch the
panel and hide the repair.  Large, flat or slightly curved sheet metal
panels are very hard to keep that way when you weld within them.  &quot;Spot&quot;
welding the flange at the edge of the panel is much easier, and looks
better if you're trying to restore the car.  You will need a lot of small
c-clamps, or sheet metal vise grips to align the seams, but take the time
and save finish work later on!

Cheers, troops!
