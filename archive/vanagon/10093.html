Pat, Joe ( and all other Westy manual owners):

why don't we pool our resources, and make copies of our manuals, and trade
with each other. In my humble (as compared to Joel's) data summarizing
skills I surmize the following manuals are currently owned by the following
subscribers

Pat Walsh- 78' Westy manual
Joe Clark- 68'-72' Westy Manual
Michael Heron- 1967 Westy Manual (approx. 40 pages tres detailed)

i like seeing Westy manuals from all years :):)

&gt;&gt;&gt;On Sat, 14 Jan 95, Pat (&quot;Got any 12V stickers, man?&quot;) Walsh
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;walshp_at_ippdsgi3.nawc-ad-indy.navy_dot_mil&gt; drooleth:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wow!  What a score on that parts manual!  If you're taking requests, I'd
&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly appreciate a copy too.  It sounds chock full of the minutiae
&gt;&gt;&gt; detail-obsesive owner/restorers such as myself covet.  (&quot;Hi, my name is Pat
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I admit to laboriously peeling the interior stickers from Westys in
&gt;&gt;&gt; junkyards and to picking up used trim screws from junkers instead of using
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;newfangled&quot; unoriginal ones from the hardware store.&quot;)  I could give you a
&gt;&gt;&gt; copy of my '70 Westy manual (covers '71 too, I'm told), or volunteer to type
&gt;&gt;&gt; up a summary of the changes shown through the years as indicated in your
&gt;&gt;&gt; manual (for inclusion in the gopher).
&gt;&gt; Joe Clark respondeth:
&gt;&gt;I feel your pain, Pat.  Have you ever found yourself up to your neck in
&gt;&gt;fire-ants, trying to remove a siezed do-dad from a rusting hulk in a
&gt;&gt;tick-ridden junkyard, and said to yourself, &quot;God I LOVE these cars!!&quot;?
&gt;Nope, can't say I've encountered fire-ants but last year I was in the nether
&gt;reaches of a junkyard and the weeds and grass were so high I had to climb
&gt;onto the tops of cars a couple of times to get my bearings as I searched for
&gt;the front of the lot.  The most amusing yard, though, was one some friends
&gt;and I went to as teenagers.  The owner was apparently a farmer, as there were
&gt;(BIG) pigs roaming the place.  No sign to that effect, we were just startled
&gt;to round a corner and come face-to-snout with one.
&gt;
