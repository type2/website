&gt;I don't know if polishing compound will take care of the groove in my

you might try talking to one of these rock-chip-fixit-places. i seem to
recall something about them being able to polish out small stuff ... if
your scratch qualifies as 'small'.

&gt;Also on the subject of windshields, what can I do to eliminate/minimize
&gt;fogged windows?  Does Rain-X work inside as well?  Do those anti-fog
&gt;cloths really work?  Anyone?

well, from personal experience, DO NOT use Rain-X inside! it makes all sorts
of wierd rainbo defraction patterns (or whatever the hell those things are)
.. and i don't smoke anything. ;)  there is supposedly some stuff made
specially for the inside, but i've never tried it after my bad experience.
by the way, if you decide to try it anyway, it's a bitch to get off. :)

    I've been trying the Rain-X anti FOG on the inside (it's supposed to
    work on the inside) but it needs to be dry when applied and my '69 KG
    leaks so bad that the inside of the windows haven't been dry for weeks.
    BTW, it doesn't work very well when applied to wet glass.  Seems to work
    pretty good on the rear view mirror, though...

    BTW, my '75 Van is loaned out right now, but I'll be getting it back
    soon.  It leaks too, but not as bad, if anyone is interested I'll let
    you know how the Rain-X Anti FOG works when used as per the directions.

    Also, while I'm here, Anyone have a source for a gasoline heater for the
    Van?  If mine was warmer, my wife would drive it year round instead of
    insisting on a &quot;new&quot; (she wants an 80's Volvo wagon) car.  Is there a
    FAQ for VW or even VW Van Heaters?
