Subject: Re: Fiberglass body parts, anyone?

I would be very interested in a front spoiler for my 91.  Actually, in the
area of add-on body panels Zenders used to sell a really nice kit of
ground effects for the vanagon.  It would be nice to reproduce some or all
of the kit.  Zenders no longer makes it and the last time I checked it
was extremely expensive.
