&gt; This is a tale of two heads ;-).
&gt; The heads arrived but the shop owner was concerned that there may be 
&gt; some cracks in the heads.  He said the area between the valves or near 
&gt; the plugs was where he has found them before.  Cracks in this area are 
&gt; an early step to dropping a valve into the cylinder,  very bad 
&gt; happening.  Under a magnifier there was one suspicious area between two 
&gt; of the valves but it was not obvious.

   cracks in this area are useable!
