Subject:      Westy pop-top conversion

Does anyone in the Seattle/Pacific Northwest area know of a person/body
shop/business that has successfully transferred a Westfalia pop-top to a
non-westy body? I have an '89 GL and the complete steel and fiberglass
roof from an '85 Westy that I'd like to have installed. Anyone?
