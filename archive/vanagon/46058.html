Subject: oil

Asked about Kendall oil _at_ the FLAPS, they pointed out
an additioned rating beyond was Castrol had. They
also pointed out the same rating on the house brand 
oil, which they said was Valvoline.

Any difference? Should I stick with Castrol? Is Kendall
worth the money?

Opinions welcome.
