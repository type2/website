&gt; What issue of European Car was that diesel engine swap from?

Sorry if I confused you, the article described an 1.9 IDI &lt;-&gt; 1.6 L swap,
not a TDI swap.
My assumption is that it is useful for the TDI swap also. However swapping in a
turbo you also have to worry about 1/ Room for the turbo. With the tilted
engine
installation the turbo point down. I'm sure room can be arranged, but that may
require some cutting, and/or rearranging of the engine cradle and tin under
the engine.
2/ Reroute and redesign intake and air filter. Again the limited room
poses a problem, as there is not much room between the current
air cleaner and sheet metal.

I don't know what issue the article came from. Jack Ewald faxed it to me.
Jack is on vacation until March 15 but you could email him and ask:
