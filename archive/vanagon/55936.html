Subject: Test driving '87 syncro - what to check?


On a lark I'm going to test drive a '87 Syncro. It's on a small-time used
car lot, price in paper is $5999. I have not seen it and I imagine it's
thrashed.

What to check for?

Vanagon items:
	head leaks
	coolant leaks
	what else?

Syncro items:
	viscous coupling (turn tight and listen for what?)
	cv joints - where and how?

I don't expect to buy this vehicle unless it's WAY underpriced. But I have
Syncro envy and want to learn about them. Any pointers will be helpful.
