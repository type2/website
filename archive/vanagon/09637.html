&gt; A friend of mine is curious about converting a diesel Vanagon to gasoline
&gt; power. Hasn't somebody on the list done this? Is there some info in the
&gt; archives? Same friend is also curious about turbocharger kits for the diesel.

for anyone who is interested, i have a couple of magazine articles about this
and for the price of an email message (be sure to include your address and
zip code, boys and girls!), i'll mail you a copy of them.

as to the turbocharger, there was a fellow who wrote a couple of articles in
the VWCOA Autoist about doing just that ... he loved it, but it was a bit of
a headache for his mechanic, as the manufacturer of the kit hadn't really
intended it to be used on vw buses. he finally got it all sorted out, though.
what about the possibility of taking a turbo diesel engine from a jetta??
might it not fit?
