Subject: Barndoor roof...

     well when I got home from work last night, there it was...
     
     ...the biggest parcel ever. I had the front 12 inches of a Barndoor 
     roof section sent through the post.
     
     It's pretty well rust free and it'll be going on to my '67 pickup as 
     part of my many retro body mods, cool
     
     just had to tell you all :)
     
     Lee.
