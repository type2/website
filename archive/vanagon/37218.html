Subject: Re: DMV


&gt;I have a '68 Bus which I want to use the engine and part for my '69 Westy.
&gt;I have a stack of papers for both (titles, bills of sales, etc) Problem -
&gt;
&gt;I can not register the '68 because it will not pass smog the DMV tells me I
&gt;can junk it but then I would have to surrender the title.  But what happens
&gt;if A) I want to put it back together or B) when I want to get rid of the
&gt;'remains'?  Also, the DMV tells me that I can not transfer title or
&gt;register the '69 because it has no engine.  I just want to little slips of
&gt;paper that have my name on them.

Oh what joy it must be to live in Kalifornia. ;)

I'm probably missing something, but why are you telling DMV about the 68 at
all? Sure, it's some sort of Federal felony to replace a 69 engine with an
identical 68 engine, but nobody *here* will tell. ;)

If I remember right, you were posting the numbers a while back from a
compression test that indicated excellent rings but you had symptoms of a
sloppy valve guide. In the 68. Is that right, I'm a little hazy? This is
why the 68 won't pass smog?

So switch the engines out, and when you do it, bolt a couple rebuilt heads
on the 68 engine. If you're really broke, just do the one with the loose
guide. We're talking about ~$150 for both of them. That should smog easily.
You don't even have a charcoal canister in the 69, right? You'd have to
smell like burning tires to fail smog in that, I would think.

To get rid of the corpse of the 68, do what all other mass murderers do;
cut it up and distribute the bits. ;) I have a 68 wish-list myself, let me
know if you're going to part it out.
