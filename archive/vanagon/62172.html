So why does my van die when out in the rain? can be driving along nice
weather, gets good gas miles, pass into the rainy area and the performance
just sucks, will have to pull over because of a loss of power, keep
revvvving the engine and it might come back to where it sounds like a
normal engine, other times it just drops like someone turned the key
off(although this only happens when my wife drives it?)

Just had a tune up, that got me new plugs, new filters, new cap n rotor,
and $100.00  less in my pocket.

Any suggestions appreciated.
