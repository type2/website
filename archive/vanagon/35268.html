Subject: Re: Subaru 2.2 in Vanagon?

&gt;It would probably be quite hard to come by one of the new 2.5's 

Note I got from a non-listie said Kennedy considered the 2.6 to be maybe a
bit rougher than 2.2 due to longer stroke?  Talked to KEP yesterday, forgot
to bring up this point.  Their kit is NOT ready yet, but the jigs for
crossbar and muffler braces are made and they are ready to go into
production.  She said the engine simply looks way better in place than the
vanagons, 'clean and simple without all the piping everywhere', there's
hope.  The main holdup is that they want to get the kit smog approved, and
are going to have the first prototype certified next week.  They are perhaps
going to provide full conversion kits?  They are lining up engine sources in
Colorado snow country.  Tim Smith
