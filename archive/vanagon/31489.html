&gt; If anyone out there has the Tom Wilson book &quot;How to Rebuild your VW

&gt; don't have this book...and my friend who does is away on holiday.

Joe,
here is the quote (pp.134-5):

1. Torque one head to 15 ft-lb. Torque the other head to 15 ft-lb.
2. Torque the first head to 20 ft-lb. Torqur the second head to 23 ft-lb.
3. Torque the first head to 23 ft-lb. Retorque the second head to 23 ft-lb.
4. Retorque the first head to 23 ft-lb.
5. After several minutes, repeat steps 3 and 4.

The previous sequence is for all type 1-3 engines with 10mm studs, and 
all type 4s. Types 1-3 engines from '73-on with 8mm studs should be 
final-torqued to only 18 ft-lb. Over-torquing these engines will only 
result in stretched studs. Engines with 10mm studs and case savers can be 
safely final-torqued to 28 ft.lb.

[Then there are 2 graphs A and B showing the tightening sequences. The 
caption says:] Begin torquing on all cylinder heads by snugging head nuts 
to 7 ft-lb using pattern A. It helps compress pushrod tubes so torque 
readings won't be artificially high. Final torque sequence at B is 
different from initial tightening pattern. Crisscrossing distributes 
torque evenly across head and pattern is same for all heads.

Graph A:	7   5 6   8 &lt;-- upper studs
		4   2 1   3 &lt;-- lower studs

Graph B:	8   2 4   6
		5   3 1   7

[End]
btw, torque for rocker arms is 18 ft-lb.

Have fun!

Sami
