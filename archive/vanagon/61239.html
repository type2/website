     Todd asked-
     
          I was driving at lunch and noticed that the speedometer had 
          stopped working.  Speed was stuck at 0 - though I did not think 
          to look to notice if the odometer was working. 
     
     A helpful passer-by suggested rapping the instrument console.
     
     You might also check to see that the driven end of the cable is 
     correctly seated and fastened (I believe this is in the left front 
     outer bearing dustcover, right?)  It should have an &quot;E&quot;-clip on the 
     end.
