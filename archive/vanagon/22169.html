Subject: '62 Kombi Report

Well with the able help of Greg Merritt ('71 Squareback) I got
my driver's door on and reasonably aligned, and my driver's side
window in.  The window was a snap, took 10 minutes.  The rubber
was pretty big and easily went around the glass, then a cord
into the groove, some dish soap on the rubber that was going
into the car, he pushed from outside while I pulled the string
out.  Bingo!   Very easy.

With the driver's headlight in now and the front bumper on too, from a 
certain angle it looks almost like a bus!!!!

My cargo door hinge plate saga continues:

I loved the vacuum cleaner idea but didn't think it would
work--there are some odd projections inside the pillar and
also the odd shape of the plate and position of the holes (and
how small the holes are) made it seem unlikely.  I
did, using wire hooks and lots of time got one of the plates
up to where I could see it--and it was trashed.  One of the
threaded holes was OK but the other was totally twisted and
unusable and unrepairable.  So I've abandoned the idea
of fishing out and reusing the old plates.

Greg (I met him via the VW lists--isn't the internet grand?)
also has access to a machine shop here at UMich so we're planning
to mill up some replacement plates, glue hooks to them and then
ingeniously (I hope) thread them through and into position.

More to come . . . .
