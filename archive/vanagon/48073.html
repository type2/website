Subject: Re: GEX rebuild/tappets

I have a GEX rebuilt engine also and I am wondering if the noise I am
hearing is the Tappets as Douglas has discussed. The engine ticks
occasionally when climbing. I was first told that it was the CV joints,
but after close inspection the CV joints were found to be in good shape.
I went for a second opinion and a well trusted shop said that they
couldnt hear the ticking, it doesnt do it all the time, so he suggested
that I use only 91 octane gas, previously I was using 85. SO I did this
and the ticking has stopped for a month, then last week climbing a pass
on the way to Steamboat the familiar tick returned.... ANy suggestions?
And how much to replace the tappets? It is an 82 with hydraulic lifters......
THanks
