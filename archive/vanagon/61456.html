Subject: New syncro 16&quot;

In Europe (and maybe the rest of the world) VW sells the Eurovan with a
syncro package. I am not sure if it is up to the old syncro as far as off
road capiblilties are concerned, but it is probably not up to the 16&quot;
vanagon syncro's stuff.

VW could try and take an Audi drive train and put a box on it and get a
syncro van. Imagine a cross between a Eurovan and a V6 Audi wagon. They
could beef it up and make it good for off road. But VW has orders to reduce
the number of vehical platforms. This would increase them.

The best way to get a good 16&quot; off road van would be to send the Eurovan
back to Styer (sp?) in Austria and have them come up with the neccessary
mods to make the Eurovan into a true off road stormer.

Now if only I could figure how to reply to Good Fuart :)&gt;
