&gt;I think thats another urban myth.  Its never worked for me.  last time I i
&gt;tried, I spent more time making the appointment than i did carrying it
&gt;out.

Last time I needed DMV services, I made an appointment, but decided to go
down without it, because it was 2 days from the day I made it and I didn't
want to wait.

What I couldn't figure out was how to cancel it! That's probably why no one
was at the window the last time I was there...
