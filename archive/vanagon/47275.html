Subject: Re: Bubble in cooling system? '87 Vanagon

&lt;&lt;Still looking for recomendations for VW mechaniocs in Northern &amp; 
central New Jersey! Bill&gt;&gt;

Is Russ's German Auto Repair still in Middlesex, NJ?  He was 
wonderful...address is Lincoln Blvd.  Check the book.

Also, one on the Pennsylvania side, down Route 22, I think you spell his 
name &quot;Russe&quot;.  Another foreign car guy -- we bought our '83 Vanagon from 
him.

My local mechanic takes care of my van just fine, although it's only a 
Mobil station with lots of great mechanics.  They're in Lawrenceville, 
off of Route 1 and 95.

Nancy
