Subject: '73 Westie for sale

I have acquired (from my son) an orange, 1973 Westie camper.  The body has
no rust or dings.  Top is in good shape except for the seal.  Interior very
good, with the original fabric, etc.  One cabinet latch is broken, and the
faucet/pump is missing.  AM/FM cassette, auto, tires old, but with quite a
lot of tread.

The negative is:  compression zero in 3 and 4, 30 and 50 in 1 and 2.  Will
need a  rebuilt engine.  Was running until a few days ago.  I would like $600

I am in SE Arizona.  E-mail if you want more info.

Thanks,
Bill			(Bill_at_freeholder_dot_com)
