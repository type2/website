Subject: vapor lock (not)

Well, thanks to the list support and some struggling on my part, I tracked
down my supposed vapor lock type behavior to a bad fuel pump!  Flow was
down to a trickle before the pressure regulator.  It looked a lot like vapor
lock because it ran fine when it was cool (at night) and only appeared after
about 20 miles of driving in the sun.  I, however, could see no reason for
vapor lock to appear so totally and suddenly.

This is good news because it's solvable.  I got a replacement for $140 in
Logan, UT and I'm back on the road.  Took it for a 40 mile test drive and it
behaved perfectly.  Hopefully I'll make it to CA in time for the wedding. 
After the wedding, Martha's!  I'll keep you all posted as appropriate.


We're off.
