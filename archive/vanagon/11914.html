Subject:       A big vanagon.lenti thanks...

At the risk of embarrassing Michael Heron of Toronto, I would like to 
extend a warm 'thank you' to him via this list.  First some 
background:

Michael helped me in obtaining the spare Westy seat I had submitted
a post for weeks ago.  Michael posted an ad from the Toronto paper
noting the seat for sale. I called the gentleman that was
selling the seat but he did not want to fool around with sending it to
the States, this is understandable as it is no small feat boxing,
transporting and mailing a 90 pound parcel.  This elderly man kept
asking, &quot;don't you know ANYBODY in Toronto that could help you?&quot;  I
didn't. Except for Michael, whom I DIDN'T know but I asked him to
help me anyway because, well, because I wanted that seat sooo bad! 
To make a long story short, Michael drove to the guy's house, paid
for the seat with his own cash, held it for me, crated it, shipped
it.  Had his wife running around paying UPS vendors.  Put up with my
posts and questions.  He did everything.

Michael's generous help is, to me, is an example of the highest pinnacle of assistance 
we all can do for each other.  It is what makes reading this list a 
pleasure, for we are NOT just cybernauts -faceless names 
communicating but never connecting.  We are a group of real 
individuals sharing knowledge, tragedies, successes, camping trips, 
beers, spare parts, and flannel.  

Here's to you Michael... May I someday have the privilege of 
returning your good will.
