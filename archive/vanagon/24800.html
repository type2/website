Subject: Re: Diesels

	The V.W. Diesel engine is one of the strongest engines ever made,
as long as you follow some simple rules, oil changes, oil changes,
oil changes, and a few timing belt changes in between. As with all
diesels they have very good tork, but I wouldn't buy an accurate
watch to guage those long trips with. The performance would be
compairable with the 1600 cc. air cooled. I have been looking for a
good used diesel camper for a few years, but they are few and far
between. Somebody knows a good thing when they see it. I own a 81
Jetta Diesel with close to 400,000 miles on it and it still gets 45
m.p.g.'s Can't afford to get rid of it.
