Subject: Re: Chassis motor number

Every time I keep looking around my bus for the chassis number, I can not
find it! Am I blind or something? The only thing I could find vin-number
plates are on the right verticle of motor cover, right side of air cooler,
and right side of front passager seat. Am I overcoming something?

you got it.  the chassis number is the VIN number  (except when they used to
register the vehicle to the engine number.    i recently got a 59 deluxe that
was registered to the motor number - a 36hp that is long gone.   it'll be fun
switching the title to washington state  i'll gave to write to wolfsberg to
verify the numbers.)
