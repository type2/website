Hi Kirk.  You're not supposed to drive with the fridge on propane or even
your LP bottle turned on!!  BAD!

Use DC power only while driving.  It's a bit of a hassle, but it sure is
safer!

Thx.

 	The pilot light for my fridge (84 westfalia), blows out
 when I drive. Is this a safety feature, and if it is, how do I
 defeat it. (don't worry I carry a fire extinguisher)
