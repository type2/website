Subject: RE: pre-coffee whining

Since I live and commute in the Santa Cruz Mountains on the California coast,
there is an etiquette by which we two lane road drivers attempt to co-exist--

If someone catches up to you, you are considered slower traffic, unless there
is slower traffic in front of you. Slower traffic will pull out at the first
available paved, wide spot on the shoulder in order to maintain good vibes with
their fellow commuters and prevent the white knuckle drivers from doing
anything dangerous.

It turns out that, although I am not (read can't be) a white knuckle driver 
in my old '64 Camper, it does handle well enough that I end up passing about 
as many people as I let pass (this is probably due to the fact that the 
median speed is about 35 MPH, so I am typically in a good power range in 
third gear).  BTW, I am one of the fastest, white knuckle types in my POSF
'Stango, but I pay the price in brakes and tires which only last 6 to 9
 months on the 'Stango compared to 4 to 8 years on the Bus.

I wish everyone would be as considerate of the faster traffic as I am in my 
Bus, we would all get to work smoothly and less stressed out.  I now let my 
wife drive when we carpool (99% of the time), as my driving, along with the
slower traffic stressed her out as a passenger, and while I don't like her 
white knuckle ways, I can sleep or not pay attention to it and thereby 
arrive work refreshed and ready to read my mailbox.

--Terry '64 Camper &amp; I think the Eurovans are a sellout to the Mini-vans 
                     that lack the uniqueness of all previous Type II's.

P.S. POSF=Piece of Sh*t Ford
