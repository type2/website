Subject: FOR SALE: '76 Camper

A few days ago I started a thread on rec.autos.vw with this opening paragraph...

&gt;I will be moving from the Boston Massachusetts area to the Bay Area of 
&gt;California soon.  I would like to have my '76 Camper Van shipped 
&gt;across the country on a truck.  I am hoping that some of the people in 
&gt;this group can offer some advice.

Well, I am grateful to all who replied.  I certainly did get some advice.  
Aside from learning about California emissions and other CA DMV
regulations, I received the following advice...

&gt;save yourself the shipping costs and the $300 dmv penalty
&gt;(not to mention the humiliation of garage mechanics refusing to work on
&gt;your rusted out east coast car) sell it before you leave

&gt;David, unless you are really attached to the bus, I would sell it.

In light of the overwhelming &quot;sell it&quot; response, I am (reluctantly) going 
to sell it!  Here are the details...

*** The bus is in Famingham, MA (Boston area).

*** It is a 1976 VW Camper Van with a gas stove, sink, and refrigerator.

*** It is NOT a &quot;rusted out east coast car&quot; (although by west coast 
    standards any east coast car is probably considered &quot;rusted out&quot;).
    It does have some rust, but for a New England car it is in
    amazingly good shape for a car half its age.  This is probably due
    to the fact that I never drove it in the winter and the previous
    owner only drove it through two winters.  I have owned it for the 
    past four and a half years.

*** The interior is in excellent condition.  There are no holes in the
    canvas and the beds (two double beds), carpeting, etc. is in 
    like-new condition.

*** It has about 140,000 miles on it.  The engine runs well and has alot
    of power (relatively speaking).

*** I have service records for the past 16 or 17 years (somewhere).

*** I haven't priced campers in New England for quite some time so I'm
    not sure how much to ask for it.  Why don't you call me and arrange
    a time to see and drive it then you can make me an offer.

*** If you have any questions, please call.

*** My numbers are:
    (617) 965-6920 x2368 (work)
    (508) 877-4732 (home, before 10pm please)

P.S.  Thanks to Joel Walker for putting me in touch with this mailing list!
