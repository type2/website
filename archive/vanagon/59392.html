Subject: Re: Need Westy sliding door screen

Give Cloyce Buchanan a call at 910-769-2427.  He's the owner of Triad 
Magnetic Van Screens, 4155 Friendship-Ledford Road, Winston-Salem, NC 
27107.  I bought some front window screens fromom him a few years back 
and they were inexpensive and worked well.  I know he sells one to place 
in the sliding door.

&gt; Do any of you fellow Vanagon listers have experiance making/buying one of
&gt; these? The bug screen would be used while the sliding door is open saving
&gt; wear and tear opening/closing the door while camping. Any information would
&gt; be helpful.
