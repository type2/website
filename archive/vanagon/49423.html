Subject: eurovan/winnebago

Hi to all VW enthusiasts,

I've hear lots of bad and a little good about the Eurovan.  

But... I am looking for something between an RV and a Conversion Van so that
I can travel in some comfort and not have to stay at motels and eat at
restaurants all the time.  About the only vehicle that I know about that
fills this requirement is the VW EuroVan camper.  I was talking to a dealer
yesterday who mentioned the marriage of Winnebago and VW in the latest
camper incarnation.  Does anyone know anything about these puppies.  Like:
how long have they been made?  are they any good?  cost?  availability of
used ones?  should I buy new if I can afford it??  If they used to be lousy,
are they better now?  etc., etc.?

I am especially concerned about their reliability, as this has been a huge
question about the Eurovans.

I really need some help here, so any and all advice on the specific question
of the VW/Winnebago vehicle or potential solutions to the general question
of what is a good vehicle to buy for &quot;camping&quot; would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dale (dgoodvin_at_ups_dot_edu)
