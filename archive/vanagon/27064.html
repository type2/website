Subject: Re: NEVER Get behind a VW BUS source

I spoke to Fred who makes the magnetic signs.  He has a bunch of them.
They're around 3&quot;x3&quot;:

     o  Never get behind a VW bus
     o  Bus Junkie
     o  Vanagon Junkie
     o  Bug Junkie
     o  VW Junkie

He sells them for $3 apiece, 2 for $5, and the entire set for $12.  He also
sells the T-shirts mentioned earlier:

&gt;Author:  KDISSE (INTERNET.KDISSE) at HR
&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine has designed and produces T-shirts for Vanagon
&gt;&quot;Junkies&quot;.  These T-shirts were a big hit with Vanagon owners at
&gt;Buses By The Arch over Labor Day.  They have been designed
&gt;from genuine VW line-art.  One style pictures a passenger and the
&gt;other pictures a Westy with top popped.  Both graphics illustrate
&gt;water-cooled  Vanagon with alloy wheels.  Both T-shirts also have
&gt;&quot;Vanagon&quot; across the bottom in matching font to the Vanagon rear
&gt;hatch nameplate. High quality 100% cotton white T-shirts were used
&gt;and the silk-screening is in blue.
&gt;
&gt;If you are interested send a $15.00 money order for L and XL
&gt;or $16.00 for XXL to:
&gt;     Fred's Sign Shop
&gt;     Randolph Road
&gt;     Detroit Lakes, MN  56501
&gt;     218-847-3973
&gt;
&gt;This is the &quot;Fred from Minnesota&quot; that has contributed numerous articles to
&gt;the LIMBOTransporter over te last several years.
