Subject: ever taken a cat on a camping trip?
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 1995 15:27:15 -0600 (CST)

Maria and I are in the process of planning our next camping trip that
should take us from St. Louis to the Great Lakes, Quebec, New England and
down the East Coast to N.Carolina. 

This is our dilemma: we adopted a declawed cat, that as far as we know,
never ventured outside a home. We could ask friends to take care of him in
our absence, but we're also thinking about taking him along. Before we
spend any time getting him acquainted with nature, we're wondering if
anyone on this list has had any experience with taking a cat on a camping
trip and would like to share it with us. (No worries: either way, we'll do
whatever is in the best interest of the cat!)

TIA for your opinions!
