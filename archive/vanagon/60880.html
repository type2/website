Subject: Re: Eurovan malf FIX

         I have been thinking about the recent posting about the Eurovan AC
clutch failure causing loss of use of the van. Looking through the Factory
manual from the dealer shows that there is a way to run the car WITHOUT the
AC compressor.

         On cars without AC (?) there is one less idler pully, the forward
one, and a shorter belt. Try this:

1. Remove the front idler pully. 
2. Remove the AC compressor. I know this will mean loosing the charge but   
that will have to be done to fix the compressor anyway.
3. Get and install a shorter belt.

          This way the car can be driven while the AC problem is sorted out.
