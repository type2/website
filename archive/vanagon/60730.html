 BatSubject:     Statz?? and Syncro front shocks????    5/30/97    12:21 PM
Ok, I don't know about you, but I can't read the Statz for beans.  It's the
part about &quot;where you all tell me you are&quot;.  I think it's standard
abreviations for states and countries, but the alphabetic order seems hosed,
or do we just have a lot of canadian listees???? (Where the heck is
CAN.ON.OTT, CAN.BC.VAN etc. etc..., anyway??)

ACTUALLY - I'm hoping there are lots of Canadian vanogoners, in fact, I hope
most of them have Syncro's.  And do we have anyone in South Africa?? and how
about the members in Europe/England/the Nordic countries etc???

I'd like to ask you to call your local or not so local favorite
dealer/aftermarketer/shop/whatever and track down what the correct front
Bilstein shock is for a SYNCRO Vanagon, vintage '84 or so on to '91.  I'm
getting some info here in the states, but so far no confirmation that such and
such a Bilstein is the correct one for the SYNCRO front.
 
The front shock for the SYNCRO is different because it has a spring perch on
it.  The standard Vanagon front shock does not.

Let's see if we can nail this one down for the archives.  I know I can buy
OEM, several places have offered, but I want the better Bilstein.

Lacking the above requested info, I am talking to Bilstein about the
situation, and may be able to identify a shock that is close.  If that ends up
the way of it, I'll let the list know what I came up with.  Bilstein offered
that if I measured diam, length, spring perch diam, etc, he might be able to
adapt an existing unit for me.

If I get correct info for the front Bilstein, I'll pass that on to both the
aftermarketers and the list as well.
