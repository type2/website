Subject: Power steering fluid on 85 vanagon?
Date: Tue, 22 Apr 1997 09:52:29 -0400 (EDT)

Greetings-

My power steering has started griping loudly whenever I turn 
corners tightly, and I was wondering about the power steering fluid, but
as I have not yet been able to pick up a repair manual (and I dont
have any originasl documentation) I'm not quite
sure where the fluid goes. There is a tank on the rear passenger
side of the engine compartment that is low, but it is labeled &quot;ATF OL&quot;. 
Anyone more knowledgable of these worldly things able to shed some
insight? 

On another melody, anyone have a way of stopping all those d***ed
parkinglot dings from marring the side of the vanagon? Where
I'm at, the people are more likely to open their door three or four
times into the side of your car for the hell of it then they are
to actually be careful to watch out for other cars around.

Ciao
Geosh
