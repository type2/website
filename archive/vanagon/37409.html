Subject: RE: BG gasoline Supercharge


Over the weekend, I had a clogged injector (good spark, new wires, new 
platinums) in #2 that caused alot of vibration and loss of power.  Dumped a 
11oz can of BG-44K into a full tank (20 gal.) of premium and ran at higher 
rpms and it cleared up within a quarter to 3/8 of a tank.

|Can anyone tell me what their experience is with this stuff? I'm told it
|works well in cleaning injectors, 2 bottles to a half tank. Pour it in,
|drive about 20 miles, let it sit overnight, and drive as usual.
