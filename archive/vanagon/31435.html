Subject: Re: Emissions shuffle - quick fix for test


&gt;What numbers did they report by the way?

The passing inspection was as follows:
HC  (ppm):  176 / 91 idle   (limit: 220)
CO (%)      0.09 / 0.52 idle (limit: 1.65)

However,  in order to get these passing emissions figures the mech had to
tune down the engine so severely that it barely runs now -- it takes a long
time to warm up and I find it dying out at every stoplight so I have to
re-start it on the go.  Not to mention the jumping and skipping as I go into
higher gears.  I ameliorated it a little this morning by fiddling with the
idle screw and the mixture-control screw. . .should be okay till next
Tuesday when I bring it in to have the proper jets put back on.
