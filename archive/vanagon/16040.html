&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I believe you should make VW pay for the entire repair. Just print out about
&gt;&gt;25 tales of wow over these head gaskets, go through the FTC arbitration
&gt;&gt;program, and you should be able to get this whole job done for free an a VW
&gt;&gt;dealer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Seriously.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;And if you are under 50,000 miles VW will pay for the whole thing no
&gt;&gt;questions asked. For other mileage up to around 100,000, VW will pay a part
&gt;&gt;of the repair no questions asked. But by going through the FTC program you
&gt;&gt;should be able to get this thing done for free.

Derek:

I am a 2nd owner of my 83 westy with 60k miles. Am I eligible to ask VWoA
to pay the cost of repairing the head gasket problem?

The westy is 12 years old now but with 60k miles only. I believe I have
bills from the previous owner that show the westy had the problem at about
40k miles. The dealer had attempted several repairs with no success.

Thanks.
