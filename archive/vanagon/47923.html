&gt; Particuarily several that venture down into Baja.  And I mean way down,
like
&gt;on the order of 20+ hours down.  These are nasty looking and performing
&gt;machines.  Big block turbo diesels,4WD, modified Heavy duty suspensions,
Full
&gt;camper layouts with microwaves, TV/VCR's, External showers, extra fuel tanks
&gt;and winches. 

&gt; Although they like the Euro they said it the ground clearance is too low to
&gt;go deep into Baja.

Having spent the winters in southern Baja since the early '80s, I agree with
the author that you can't beat the Westy for all around functionality. When I
head south in October, now, it's in a motorhome, draging my '82 Diesel Westy
behind. I just can't seem to let it go. I commute back and forth between
Conception Bay and the States in the Westy.That's 700 miles for about $15 in
fuel. I also make numerous side trips all over Baja in the Westy.

I digress. What I was planing to say was; you can go to Baja in any vehicle.
It makes no difference what it is, as long as it's in halfway decent shape.
Having a Westy though is the best way to go.

When I was a kid, I had a '61 Westy that i sold in '67. After I sold it, I
had dreams about it from then on. I dreamed I still owned it but forgot where
i parked it. Oh well... the dreams stoped when I bought the Vanagon Westy in
'88.

Party on VolksFolks,
