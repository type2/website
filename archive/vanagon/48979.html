Subject: HELP! 90 Overheating on Road Trip

Help!  I'm on a road trip, en route to the Boston to New York AIDS ride, and
my 90 Westy's temp idiot light keeps coming on about every 115-120 miles.  I
didn't bring along the Bentley and have no more ideas.  Can anyone suggest
anything?  I've got plenty of coolant and the fuse to the radiator is OK.
Its never done ths before.  I stop for five minutes and its OK, then get
back on the road, set the cruise for 65 and in about 115 miles it does it
again.  I sat in a parking lot trying to get the engine temp to raise and
the radiator fan didn't come on...any suggestions?

I stopped by a friend's place in Ithaca to use his computer, so if you have
and suggestions, e-mail me back at rrw2_at_cornell_dot_edu, since he's not on the
list.  And if there is anyone between here and Boston that might know how to
troubleshoot it, I'd be REALLY glad to hear from you!

Thanks!
Ian Webb
