Subject: speeds in eurovans.
Date: Fri, 30 Sep 1994 14:07:51 -0500 (CDT)

Just as an aside, the top speed for a Vanagon and Eurovan is roughly the
same.  I have an '84 Vanagon and my parents have the '93 Eurovan.  The tach
runs roughly the same rpms at speed in 4th and 5th (Vanagon, Eurovan
respectivaly).  The redlines aren't much different.

When coming back from Minoqua (northern Wisconsin) to Madison we were going
with traffic at 80-85 mph all the way (happens to correspond to 4500rpm or
so).  We were carrying 4 people and camping gear.  Not many hills, but the
Van hummed along just fine.  We still had pedal left, so the thing would
have gone all the way up to redline, (it's not drag limited, suprisingly!)

I have driven both vans and observed that the tach is approx the same at
different highway speeds, sooooooo, whatever :-)
