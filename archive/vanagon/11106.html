I was thinking I might go buy some tools soon and wanted some 
advice.  I have been getting by with a little help my friends but it 
has to stop.  I am busy working and saving money so that I might buy a
new motor.  I am planning right now on building this myself.  They 
have, at Sears, this huge metric set for something around $100.  Just 
sockets and ratchets if I remember.  It has 1/4&quot;, 3/8&quot; and 1/2&quot; 
ratchets.  This seems like a better deal than the mongo huge sets with
metric and american sizes.  Yes?  Also, what should I have in the way 
of open-end wrenches.  I already have the 6-14mm sizes.  Finally, I 
will need a torque wrench.  Assuming they come in sizes, what size 
drive do I want for this?  TIA, Jim
