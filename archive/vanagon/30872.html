Subject: VWs in Hollywood [was VW sighting (Field of Dreams)]

Dave writes:

&gt;        Sorry if this is basic information, I just saw Field of Dreams
&gt;today for the first time and Kevin Costner drives around in a red VW
&gt;bus.  I read the book that this movie was based on (Shoeless Joe
&gt;by Ray? Kinsella) a couple of years ago and really liked it, so I never
&gt;watched the movie because I didn't think that I would like it as much.
&gt;All in all I thought it was a pretty good movie.
&gt;FWIW,
&gt;dave.


I have been making notes in my sketchbook (I often sketch when I watch TV
or whatever) whenever I see VWs in movies...

Here's what I've seen so far...
(This list isn't as cool as I'd like it to be, but who has time for this
stuff... ;]  )

*** Lots of screen time:
Tapeheads--the main characters drive around in a Thing

Slackers--one of the charatcters takes some girls to a gig in his white bus

Fried Green Tomatos--what's her face rear-ends a red bug convertable
belonging to two young females

*** VW Sightings in movies (quick peeks...)
Broco Billy-- bug on the road after scene &quot;may I touch your breast...&quot;

Chuck Norris Film (title unknown) -- Chase scene, many Westfalias and a bug
are featured in one chase seen, sumo wrestler type bad guy picks up bug
(literaly) and threatens driver

Breaking Away--used car lot has two bugs for sale

Dr. No--bug in parking lot at start of film

Live and Let Die-- Bug on street in New Orleans funeral scene.

Bikini Car Wash (USA up all night movie...I love bad films...)--Cal type
bus gets hosed down by a couple of bimbos.

That's all I have for now.  If you ever see an aircooled in a movie, even
just for a second, please let me know!!

Regards,

J89
