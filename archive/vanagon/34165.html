Subject: Interesting Discovery about my '54
Date: Tue, 30 Jan 1996 22:36:53 -0800 (PST)

I was putzing around with my '54 bus tonight, and I started playing with the
clock.  I set the time to high noon, and noticed that there was a knurled
ring underneath the clock body, so I turned it - its a windup clock!

For some reason I assume it was electric.  Are all deluxe clocks
windup, or are the later ones electric?

Kind of a cool feature.  I'd been wondering what it mean by &quot;8-day&quot;
