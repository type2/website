Subject:  Good News Story? 

This is good news? New engine at 18K!! Never stranded in 38K! JEEZ!
The only time my Tercel failed  was a 5 minute intermittant 
problem that occurred at just beyond 100K miles and I was really miffed
that the  piece of S**t failed so early in its life! Had it needed a tow, 
I would have been really mad! The 'ignitor' in
the ignition was replaced, and the problem never re-occurred
This is the only part other than brakes, exhaust that has been replaced.
Of course at 110,000 miles, its just getting broken in.
You guys seem to have a bent view of RELIABLE?

&gt;On the matter of EV (Dis?)Satisfaction:
&gt;(to add to Ric's comments)
&gt;
&gt;I have to add we have been very satisfied with ours.  at (almost)
&gt;39,000 miles, it has never left us stranded -- the engine was replaced
&gt;at 18,000 miles, but that was to fix a long-term problem, the piston
&gt;slap.  The vehicle has put up with four family members, one (BIG)
&gt;yellow Lab, and three PA winters.  It steers as tight as it did the
&gt;first day, and feels pretty much the same.
