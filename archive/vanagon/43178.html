Subject: Re: Rust remover/preventative recommendations? (fwd)


&gt;Of all the rust &quot;preventaive&quot; gizmo's i have used i have found the POR 15
&gt;to be the best stuff out there
    &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;POR (paint over rust) is NASTY!!!! It contains incocynates (sp?) which by
&gt;their name implies that they have carcenogenic properties. As such you
&gt;should get some PROPER breathing apparatus and paint in a WELL
&gt;ventilllated area.


Hmmmm... wasn't it MIC, Methyl Isocyanate, that leaked out of the Union
Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, killing 2000+ people just by touching them?
I wonder if it's related to the stuff you write about, give or take a
few spelling errors. If so, then if the stuff gets loose in your garage,
I'd say cancer will be the least of your problems.

Wonder if it can be made to work selectively, on car thieves?   :-S
