Subject: Re: 1980 Vans and color

YES! There is a direct relationship to year(s) and color. Although any
specific color may be used in multiple years, you can distinguish a 
range of years that a certain color was produced. I have studied this
issue - although not in a perfect research method. We could probably
build a list, by year of colors produced - at least for the US/Can.
vehicles.

My '80 was 'pumpkin orange' although the title/reg listed it as 'brown'

&gt;From the '88 brochure I have and the color chart of that year I can report
that the Vanagon cam in 4 colors that year:

	Flash Silver (so did the '90 &amp; '91)
	Toronado Red
	Blue (I need to look at the brochure for the exact name - med dk)
	Pastel White

	The first three of these were metallic paints. The white was not.

&gt; Someone asked about the difference in the 80 and 81.  It made me wonder.  
&gt; I have a '80 Camper, and it is light blue.  There is another vanagon 
&gt; camper in town similar to mine and it is light blue too.  
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if their is a relationship between the year, model and 
&gt; color of the vans.  I realize that some have been pained.  
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any thoughts?
