Subject: Camping at Disney World

Has anyone ever camped on the Disney property (at Fort Wilderness, not
actually _ in_ the Magic Kingdom, although that would be interesting if you
could drive your VW that far.) Is it decent? It's expensive--$42-$49 a night.
Was it worth it?

 PS-Disney World in FL, not Disneyland in CA )I don't have time this
vacation to drive that far).
