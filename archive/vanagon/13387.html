Subject: Re: Reinforced sidewall tires

Hi, it's report card time for the subject.

Thanks for all the suggestions. I got my tires from Price Club yesterday
afternoon finally.

I headed for Price Club after reading some comments from the list about
Uniroyal Laredo LT 195/75R14. After lunch I decided to get them. But
When I got there I found out that they have Michelin XCH4 195/75R14.
It's a 6 ply tire with max pressure at 55 PSI, 5 PSI higher than the Laredo.
And it's actually a few bucks cheaper. The Michelin appears to be better
tires. I paid $245.25 total for 4 tires. I have 34 PSI for front and 36 PSI
for rear. The ride is great. I think it is actually better than XZX. I'll
never consider XZX any more in the future.

I did not call Discount Tire again. They did not offer to beat prices from
other competitors here in the SF Bay Area. I am happy for the Price from
Price Club. I don't know anywhere else offers better prices in the area.

Thanks again for all comments/experiences/suggestions. With the new tires
and appropriate pressure on them my steering wheel suddently became a piece
of cake to handle. My wrists were near the brink of wearing out with my old
XZX. What a difference it makes with new tires.
