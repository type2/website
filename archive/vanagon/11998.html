Subject: leaking valve cover gaskets

Hi everybody,
I did a major tune up on my Camper ('76) and noticed that the valve cover 
gaskets on both sides were leaking. So I bought new ones and put them in 
after adjusting the valves. After I got to work this morning I checked 
the valve covers for oil again and they were wet again. With wet I mean 
they are not leacking in a way that oil drops down.
So is there any remedy for that? Or is this normal and nothing I should 
worry about? I'm still on the steep part of my learning curve regarding 
VW vans....
I'm also in the process installing an ammeter and I am wondering what the 
best way is to run cables from the engine compartment all the way to the 
dashboard and back. Under the carpet? Behind the cabinets?
Thanks for any help.
