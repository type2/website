Ron,



Glad to hear you're pleased with your Paulchen.  I agree, they're worth 
every penney.  I recently adapted mine to carry my fly-fishing kick-boat, 
fully inflated.  It's quite a site, with the two pontoons projecting 
vertically above the roof line, but works great.  



BTW, where did you get your van cover?  I've been thinking about getting 
one, but haven't been able to find anything specifically for the van (I'e 
got a Westy, incidentally)?
