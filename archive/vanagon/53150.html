Subject: Re: returned home from- Getting away

&gt; Sorry, I meant the 86 GL that's for sale.  I may have found a 87 Syncro
&gt; not too far from home though.  Sorry for the confusion.  8-)
&gt; 
   Cool.. After this week, all the work I have into my 
          syncro payed off!

    The 86 GL For Sale:

  Well , It's my baby.... But no AC, no 4x4. So the syncro, with AC
         replaced it. Now I only drive it once a week, to keep
         rust off the rotors and stuff. It has about twice the HP of 
         my stock Syncro. I have done what I call &quot;Super tuning&quot;
         on it. I will have to work on the Syncro for the next
         year or so to make It what this Vanagon is....
