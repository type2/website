Subject: no charging when hot


I've got an '84 vanagon that's got an electrical charging problem.  The
charge idiot light comes on after about 15 minutes of driving (OK when
cold).  Thought it was the voltage regulator... replaced it, no good.

Is the alternator going bad?  Where to find one?

Thanks,
