&gt; I have one of these covers, but thought it was for using only
&gt; while washing the car to keep water out.  Are you saying I should
&gt; keep it on there all the time except when the propane is in
&gt; use by either appliance?

Right on Martha!  (Okay, I think I beat this one to death...) 

According to my manual it's for keeping out dirt as well as
rain and car wash water.  It seems to keep the bugs out too.
