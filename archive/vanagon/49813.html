&gt; &gt; My 85 Westy has been diagnosed  with a leaky head gasket thru a pressure
&gt; &gt; check followed by a visual check. It looks like this will be an expensive
&gt; &gt; repair although the repair costs seem to vary quite a bit depending on wheter
&gt; &gt; or not the heads are pitted. I am praying that the block is not pitted. I am
&gt; &gt; told but don't know why the heads/block cannot be shaved to remove the
&gt; &gt; pitting. I have the following estimates:
&gt; &gt; Dealer #1 - $1800-2400 assuming pitted heads and depending on repair of parts
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; disintegrate durring disassembly
&gt; &gt; Dealer #2 - $500-700 heads not pitted, up to $1800 if heads pitted
&gt; &gt; Local VW Mechanic - $1100 using an special sealant which seals the pitted
&gt; &gt; heads from an aftermarket guy in New Jersey
&gt; &gt; My questions are:
&gt; &gt; 1. Has anyone had experience with any kind of sealant that seals pitted heads
&gt; &gt; 2. Which comes first, leaking gasket or pitted heads
&gt; &gt; 3. If only one head gasket leaks, why replace both head gaskets at the same
&gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If the heads aren't pitted it's $5-700 but I don't know if they are pitted.
&gt; &gt; The special sealant saves money if the heads are pitted but it is also a bit
&gt; &gt; of a risk.
&gt; &gt; Anyone's experience on this problem is welcome.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; I have had this problem for about 2 years.  Now at 137k miles.  A good coolant sealant 
&gt; added to the antifreeze has bought me two years but I do face head replacement soon.  
&gt; My shop has indicated all of these engines they have worked on needed to replace the 
&gt; heads due to pitting.  The problem is the phosphate coolant we use rather than 
&gt; the not so common phosphate free coolant recommended by VW.  Rebuilt head have been 
&gt; quoted to me at $315 to $488 each which included new valves.  I suspect if you do not 
&gt; do your own work you would be wise to put in the rebuilt heads, paying for the job only 
&gt; once.  That is what I plan to do in the next few weeks.

Hi,

Another option is to send your heads to somewhere like RIMCO, who will
inspect/test your heads and repair them as necessary, including doing the
valves.   I had great luck with them, and saved a couple hundred bucks.
