&lt;&lt; &gt;From the archives:
 &gt;&gt;Unscrew your door sill and remove the carpet. Peak under the floor boards
and look for large flat plastic domes with Phillips head in them.  Carefully
cut the flooring parallel with the corrugation in the sheet metal with the
domes in it. This is to remove two strips same length as the floor rails you
scrounged.  Take out the plastic screws, bolt down the rails and slide in
your new middle seat.&lt;&lt;

I really don't know what all the confusion is.

You got a '87 westFalia, right??? (it's spelled with an &quot;f&quot;, not a
&quot;ph&quot;....look on your poptop...)

well, if you got an '87 westy, and want to put a middle seat outta a 7 pass
van into your westy, have you ever looked under the carpet mat in your cargo
floor?

you should have 2 filler strips in tracks in the formica floor, already in
there for this purpose. This is if you have a westy GL. (WWW's don't have
this)  
Remove the filler strips, and slide in the seat.

It MUST be rocket science....
