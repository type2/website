Subject: Road Trip!!

I will be leaving Indianapolis in a week or so for a road trip. I will be
accompanied by one of my cats, Shout.  I will be taking I-90 from northern
Indiana through Toledo and Clevland Ohio, Erie PA, Buffalo Rochester
Syracuse Utica and Albany New York and into MA. After visiting in MA I'll be
dropping down through Baltimore and into Washington D.C.  From there I'll be
following I-70 up through West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and finally back
into Indiana. 

I will be driving my 1980 Vanagon &quot;Roger&quot;. Hopefully I won't need this
information, but I'll ask anyway. Can anyone give me advice on the best (or
any) VW repair shops along the way?

I'll also be looking for Blues bars as well as Brewpubs. 

If anyone can supply me with info I will be eternally greatful.
