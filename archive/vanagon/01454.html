In regard to the question....buy 'em up quick. In the July issue of
Thoroughbred &amp; Classic Cars (published in the UK....excellent mag
if you are into those sort of thing...why is it that the Brits
put out such great mags (T&amp;CC, Your Classic, Popular Classic,
VolksWorld, etc)?) is the following:

Rick Cole's &quot;Gold List&quot;

Ten years ago when Ric Cole was a solo auctioneer, before becoming
part of the World Classic organization, he introduced his &quot;Gold
List&quot; of cars most likely to increase in value in the US market
over the following five years. Below is the latest list.

BMW 3.0CS coupe, 1972-74			$8 - $14,000
Forties &quot;woodie&quot; wagons and sedans		$22- $27,500
MGA roadsters 1955-62				$8 - $12,000
Mercedes-Benz 300 sedans, 1951-62		$8 - $15,000
Chevy Impala/Impala SS convertibles 1961-67	$10- $15,000
Jaguar E-type roadsters 1969-71			$18- $25,000
Alfa Romeo Guilia Spider 1963-65		$13- $16,000
Plymouth Fury/Sport Fury convertible 1959-64	$8 - $16,000
Mercury Monterey 2 door Coupe 1949-50		$8 - $12,000


and of interest to the list.......
