Joel: a good reason to get a tachometer. I figured that rpms roughly carried
over from the bug engine and since the KG goes about 3800 at 60, that's
what I assumed the Westfalia would do, but it sounds like the gearing is
quite a bit different....Thus far the oil pressure gauge has served as my
&quot;tach&quot; with 40psi equating to4000 rpms and so on......DC
