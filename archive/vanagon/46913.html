Subject: re: My bus parts Stolen!!

A few years back I was a park nature center, I parked by bus next to another
bus cause they looked so good side by side.
When we came out after the talk my bus was missing all those little chrome
clips that fit around the window trim...all of them!
I don't park next to other busses any more.
