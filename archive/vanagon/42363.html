Subject: Re: Red Light

ultimate test of my overhaul work. Got on to the motorway (about 5 miles from
home) and the generator light came on, i did'nt think the battery would get
me all the way so i took the next junction off and left it round my aunty
house. As i came to a stop and the revs went down the light flickered off.
and when it was idling it did not come on.
Any suggestions?
