It sounds like a 58-61 from the taillights and turn signals, maybe a westy
with the flip top.   Nice!

There is a body number on the passenger side behind the front seat, which
approximates the chassis number and would tell the year.  There is also a
plate there with the M-codes, which would reveal all. (if it has one, those
appeared in 1960, i believe)

BTW, the engine lid, above the liscence plate light, is it domed out, or
flat?
