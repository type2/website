I would like to add a comment- The Parts Place return policy is that
Parts Place will not pay for shipping for return of an item for ANY
reason. If an item needs to be shipped back, the customer pays. If
Parts Place sends you the wrong item, it is shipped back at your
expense. In addition, Parts Place will not send out a replacement
item unless 1- the original is returned, and once they receive it the
replacement will be shipped, or 2- Parts Place will charge the cost
of the replacement item to your credit card, and issue a credit when
the original item is returned.

Getting that wholy unbiased comment out of the way, I would just like
to add that if we recognize that our suppliers we use are just like
the ownership of our vehicles themselves, we will avoid any major
firestorms on the pros/cons of certain businesses. Some people
swear by volkswagens, some people wouldn't touch them with a 10 ft.
pole. In the same way, people have different experiences with
businesses.

Any flames or questions please reply privately.
