&gt;Sami, could you send me info on the catalog you have (or
&gt;place you said they were $35).  What a coincidence - just
&gt;yesterday I stopped by a VW dealer because my mud flaps finally
&gt;wore out and the rubber split in half (I only have them on
&gt;the front but rear mud flaps would be cool to have also).
&gt;The dealer wanted $90 each!  I laughed and walked out.

Ok, I got the 1994 West Coast Metric catalog (#10) and I know there's a
newer out there. But here's what it says on page 104 of the catalog and
page 8 of the July '94 price sheet:

211-805-L/R-BK, Mud Flaps, w/Hardware, Left and Right, Black, fits 68-79,
2 per car. $33.95

211-805-L/R-WH, Mud Flaps, w/Hardware, Left and Right, White, fits 68-79,
2 per car. $33.95

There's a small picture and the VW logo is on it.

Their phone #s are (800) 247-3202 and (310) 325-0005.
