I'd be happy to do it. 

&gt; 					And while thinking about it, I do not remember seeing 
&gt; where anyone has put information about this list or VintagVW on their 
&gt; page.  Maybe this would help others find this GREAT pool of knowledge. 

I'm not sure we can take many more people before:

1.  Gerry gets tired of people emailing him
2.  Umn decides the load on their machines is too high
3.  The list explodes

Sure, I would like everyone with a type II VW to be on this list, but it
just isn't practical.  I think we get plenty of new subscribers without
advertising on the web.  See, I'm greedy.  I want this resource.  I
have made a lot of friends on this list, and if it went away for
whatever reason, I would be devastated.  I'd rather not take a chance on
it going out of control like one of Bradley's campfires.  My two cents.
