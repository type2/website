&gt;or the signs folks used to paint on the farmer's barns and silos?
&gt;&quot;See Rock City&quot;, and that sort of stuff. i guess billboards kinda put

&gt;out of business ... or the lack of farmers nowadays. around here, we
&gt;had
&gt;one fellow with two large silos right by an old highway. Schlitz beer
&gt;paid
&gt;him some money and painted those silos to look just like two big tall
&gt;cool
&gt;cans of beer. quite impressive as you rounded the curve.
