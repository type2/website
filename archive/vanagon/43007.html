Subject: '84 westy F/S Toronto




Howdy Vanagonians,

This weekend, while getting together with fellow Torontonian
Vanagonian, Mike, We happened across a very beautiful 1984 Westy.

While we were checking it out, in awe of it's total absence of visable
rust, it's owner, Don, emerged from a house and informed us that he
was interested in selling it.

This van is clean!!!  The stove may have been used three times, but not
much more.  I couldn't notice any rips, burns or tears in the interior
with my short glance.  The owner claims that it's never had the dreaded
head-gasket-itis, and that it's got the right coolant in.

        1984 Westfalia
        Automatic Transmission
        appears to be in excellent condition
        150 000 km (or relatively close, I don't remember exactly)
        small patch on pop-top canvas is only visable damage.
        fairly new (passenger car type) tyres all around.

        He's hoping for $9000 Canadian...  But I'd bet we could knock
        a grand off of it.

If you're interested, his name and telephone Number are...

        Don Green
        (416) 954-1774

I'd be willing to take a better look at it for you also, if you had
specific questions that you needed answered.  Just E-mail me...





Cheers,

SStones,  Toronto Ont.
