Subject: linkage problems?
Well I done did it, I now own three bay windows. Went out and got the 69
campertonight. Before I tell of that adventure let me ask. If it will not
shift out of gear (1st) but the clutch releases when pushed in, could this be
a linkage problem?? Or is it the trany.

Well we headed out to look at the bus again, it was out in the semi-country,
in front of a suburban log-house. We looked, we hemed &amp; hawed, we wanted it
but didn't want hem to know it. Listed off all the problems, which wouldn't
have been so bad but they really are problems. Still, it was in a lot better
shape than those other two loafers. So finally we talked him into $400 cash.
We prepared ahead by going to the bank for our maximum of $200 from the ATM
yesterday and Maxed it out at $200 today. (that's because we bank with a
credit union in the capital city and the only local access is the ATMs--trust
me, it all comes together). So he takes the $400 cash and its ours. Only
problem is it will not shift out of first. So we take off, well, we leave. My
wife following me in my parents huge Lincoln Town car, her flashers on, and me
in my new camper, most of my flashers on. As we begin to toot along the two
lane semi-country road the rain comes, all day it had threatened. Got me once
earlier just as I was about to pull the engine out of the 71, wouldn't have
been so bad but for that stupid dog of mine that wouldn't go in out of the
rain, and me chasing him around the yard. Well anyway the downpour came. Did I
mention the wipers don't work? Also the reason we couldn't start it the last
time we looked at it was it was out of gas. So first stop, the gas station.
And you know that Town car always needs gas. As the rains continue my wife
runs in to pay only to find out this stop and go &quot;don't take credit cards
honey.&quot; So I sit in the back of my newly acquired home away from home while
therain pours and my wife runs to the nearest ATM. Ah, but no . . . We max out
on our limit for the day. So only after pleading and taking our six year old
son in and trying to look like a trusting family (I should have gotten that
hair cut and brought a change of clothes after crawling around inspecting the
camper). Fortunately the male manager wasn't there and they took pity on us,
till 4pm tomorrow. So we were off again, at 11 - 13 miles an hours, let me
think, I believe that makes it a two hour ride. Fortunately the latter half of
the trip was four lane, no cops stopped us (what insurance officer?), the rain
let up, and we are having a street rod convention with over 1,500 of them
roadsters running around, pretty, very pretty scenery. So my new baby is home
and hopefully I will be down to one bus in a few weeks. Take care
