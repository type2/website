&gt; Helmut,

&gt; I have a question that maybe you can help me with.  I'm under the
&gt; impression that you're in Germany, if so this is where you can be a real
&gt; help.  Of course if you're not...I feel rather dumb. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; When I was in Berlin in the summer of '95 I saw a couple of interesting
&gt; light set-ups on Vanagons.
&gt; 
&gt; I saw late model vans ('86 and up) with round headlights (in the US they
&gt; would've been rectangular) that weren't the normal 7&quot; (18 cm ?) but much
&gt; larger like 9&quot; (23 cm).  I saw these on all the police and ambulance Vans
&gt; as well as regular Vans.  What were these lights, and are they available as
&gt; a modification?  Or are they a government only type option.
&gt; 
&gt; A second set-up had the  normal round head lights but with driving lights
&gt; in the grille similar to the later model GTI's (up to '91).  Do you know
&gt; anything about these?
&gt; 
&gt; Both of these would be great light upgrades so any info would be really
&gt; helpful.  I'll be back in Europe this summer, but it's hard for me to get
&gt; good info since I don't speak German.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; James
