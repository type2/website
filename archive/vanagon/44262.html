Subject: Re: 78 Westy: Green plaid seat fabric



&gt;I am trying to locate some of the &quot;lovely&quot; 70's era bright 
&gt;green/olive green/yellow-orange/black plaid seat fabric
&gt;to use for rebuilding the front seats of my 78 Westy.
&gt;Anyone know of a source for this kind of stuff? TIA.
&gt;

One trick that I've seen is to remove the mattress from your &quot;bunk 
bed&quot; in the pop-top area, and cut out the fabric from the underside 
of the mattress (where it is never seen anyway, since it is pressed 
against the wooden bed frame).  Use it to recover your seats, and 
just sew any old fabric onto the mattress bottom.  Might be an 
option if you can find (or afford!) the fabric you want.

Also, I seem to recall seeing a post some time ago about a junkyard 
that had a bunch of Westy plaid mattresses in a pile, that could be 
used for the fabric.  Was it Campbell-Nelson, maybe??  You might 
want to check the archives.
