&gt; &gt; Gerry, The Control Freak.
&gt; &gt; Gerald Skerbitz &lt;gsker_at_med.umn_dot_edu&gt; U of MN Med School Admin 6-5379

&gt; How could anyone driving a Type 2 possibly be a control freak.  In a good 
&gt; wind or under the influence of a large truck in the adjacent lane, it's 
&gt; hard to believe we have any control at all. :-)
&gt; 

You people just don't get it. Jeez...

  When he said Control Freak, he meant we were freaks about Controls.
I have 4 heater levers, a fuel-enrichment plunger, a aux heater timer,
and all sorts of other controls. I love them all. We had a month long
thread on heater levers, and another month on the mystery silver hole
on Westies that people stick their key into by mistake, and another on
how to pump the ignition control on the ice-box to get it running...

  Do you see it know?

I hope I cleared this all up. Being a control freak is ok. It is not
a character flaw.
