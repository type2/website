Subject: lakeport/marin brewing/meeting time.update


Ken, Bradley, et al - Albrecht now thinks he can get away a little
sooner on Friday, so we are moving the meeting time at Marin Brewing
Company to 5 p.m., instead of 6:30 as earlier posted.  If Albrecht
is late on account of traffic, it's not like we won't have something
to do there.  ALso, we could (once he arrives) all eat dinner
together out - either there, or elsewhere.  Hope that suits - seems
easier than trying to bring extra food and cooking late at nite
by the time we get where we are going.

5:00 then on Friday, unless I hear to the contrary.  I talked to Bradley, btw, who didn't know the directions to
the place, only how to get there.  Ken seems to know where it is,
so Albrecht, I suggest you call the Marin Brewing Company in
San Rafael (phone info) and ask them for directions as to
the best way to get there from your area.  I earlier mentioned to
you the Richmond-San Rafael bridge, but upon rethinking, it may
be easier for you to go across the Golden Gate bridge from
your location.  See what they recommend....
