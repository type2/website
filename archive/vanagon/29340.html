Well, the highest mileage I've ever seen is 99,999.  Then it just rolls
over to 00000.  Since I'm not the first and only owner of any of mine it's
hard to say.  I know one of the POs replaced the tranny in the '66, and
now I've replaced it.  So, I figure that means my '66 probably has 300k or
more.
