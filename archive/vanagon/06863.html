Subject: 12/110V Refrigerator 4 sale


My van was equipped with a 12/110V (no propane) fridge which (after 
cleaning and testing, it works at least on 110 V, havn't tried it on 12V) 
now blocks valuable space in our storage compartment...

Since I either want to use the space in the van (and in the storage) for 
other things, and/or am going to install a propane operated fridge (when 
I have time, money, and the real urgent need for it), I would like to get 
rid of the old one...

I have no idea how old that fridge is (could be 14 years, was probably 
installed by Country Homes, CA when they converted the Van into a camper) 
and what the value is, so any offer that sounds reasonable to me is o.k.

Problem: it is not a very handy thing to ship, so you would either have to
pick it up in Davis (N CA), or I could take it along the first weekend in 
January 1995 (Pfeiffer Big Sur 'come together', still planning to go!).

Send me a mail (mgdoherr_at_ucdavis_dot_edu) if you are interested!
