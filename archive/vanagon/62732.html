Bob,
You may want to consider circulating engine oil after shutdown. There is
a pre-lubing device called the pre-luber that circulates engine oil
through all galleys the oil pump services and does this before (to avoid
dry starts) and after, this feature primarily cooling down oil cooled
turbos. If I turbo-ed an engine I would definitey go this way. This
system is employed by UPS for thier delivery vans for they have well
proven that the pre-lubrication vastly extends engine life. Drawback-
they are about $400.00. Type in Preluber into Alta Vista and you can get
all you want.
