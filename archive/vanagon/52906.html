Went to a self service junkyard today and much to my surprise there was
an 80 Westy  being parted out. The place is very cheap. Scored a trailer
hitch for $9.00. The place is in Richmond Va. It still has the engine and
tranny some interior parts are gone. If you have any Questions Email me.
BTW they usually sell any engine for $79.00 And doors are $29. AS you can
see the stuff is super cheap.
