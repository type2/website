Subject: You can't do that in a mini-van... [EV MV brag]

On a simple trip to McDonalds (that curse of having kids) I noticed two 
thing we could do in our Eurovan MV that you couldn't do in a mini-van.

1.  Pulled up to a drive through ATM.  My daughter also wanted to use the 
ATM.  I pulled up a bit further and she reached out the sliding side 
window and took care of her business.

2.  MickyD's was really crowded.  No tables.  Well just trundle on out to 
our own personal table in the MV.
