&gt;   Hello,   Anyone iterested in looking at and or test driving the syncro at
&gt; Strousburgh's in York for me . 

I passed the dealership on Sunday evening and did not see it there. 
Someone called from Ohio apparently and was interested.  It may be
sold.  If it's not, I will be in PA this weekend and could give it a
once over and a test drive.  I will inspect it cursorily but, I'll be as
thorough as I can.  I'll try to be objective....though I am partial to
Syncros.

I talked to the man and he says $6000.  I don't know how firm that is. 
I'm willing to help out as much as I can to find a home for this car. 
Apparently the PO was a little old man from Pennsylvania...go grandpa,
go grandpa, go grandpa go!...who died and willed it to a son that wanted
to get rid of it. (Idiot!)  

What I find out, I will post.  Anyone interested in a list of things for
me to check, just post it.  I'll check the basic stuff and the
drivetrain, body, brakes, compression, coolant, oil, etc.

						Later,
