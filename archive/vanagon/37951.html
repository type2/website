Hey all,
Regarding the planned trip on the Dempster Hwy.  Car and Driver magazine
not too long ago took a bunch of minivans up this very same road and the
resulting article made for very interesting reading.  Check the back
issues at your local library if you're going to go.  Also, bring lots of
spare tires -- I recall the C &amp; D folks going through MANY tires.  

Should be a cool trip.  Too bad I'm working this summer.

Sean
