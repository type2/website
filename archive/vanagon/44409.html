Hi Mike,

After my dealer installed $1,656.00 worth of parts and labor without
fixing the problem I had them to remove the new parts (air flow meter,
several temperature sensors,  TP switch, complete ignition setup, etc. )
issue a credit to my account and gave them a copy of Derek Drew's (our
hero)  document and I drove away a happy Westy owner again.

&gt;         Greetings once more. The van went back into the shop yesterday,
as
&gt; it puttered (for lack of a better word) out on me on Wednesday night 1km
&gt; from home. An older German gentleman in a well maintained Audi was the
only
&gt; person out of 50 or so vehicles that was kind enough to even stop and
ask
&gt; me if I needed a hand.
&gt;         The van seemed as if it was out of gas, or was not getting a
&gt; consistent fuel flow at all, but it was dark and I was tired, so
&gt; investigation was held off till thurs. It started fine the next day but
was
&gt; idling very rough so I called the shop that had done the work on it
earlier
&gt; in the week and they towed it in for free and spent all of yesterday and
&gt; most of today trying to figure it out.
&gt;         They suspected that a)it was eletrical or b) that there may have
&gt; been dirt/crud/water or something in the fuel that did not jive with the
&gt; engine at all. It seems fine now so I nor they know exactly what had
&gt; happened but Im crossing my fingers it never happens again.
&gt;         Anyhow We'll see how she runs this weekend and take it from
there I
&gt; guess. Its been a very trying week though with having to take her into
the
&gt; mechanic twice and all.
&gt; 
&gt; have a good weeknd all,
&gt;
