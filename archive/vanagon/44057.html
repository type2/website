Initial impressions:  Previously, I have only driven my '72 and '73 buses
so that is what I compare to.  This bus is geared slightly lower, the
brakes aren't as easy to push, the ride seems a little more truck-like
and bouncy, I've got more headroom (!), it feels more &quot;old fashioned&quot;
perhaps because of the steel dash and proximity to the front windscreen,
and its more fun!  (its hard to describe this *fun* factor but it is
definitely there, at least for me.)
