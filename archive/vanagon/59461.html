Subject: '81 heater cables
Date: Tue, 6 May 97 23:55:15 EDT

Hey all,
I have a quick compatability question.

I have an '81 Vanagon Westy.  It's air-cooled.  I'm going to need new
heater cables for it, which I plan to do this summer.  I am also going
to need the hardware that attaches the heater cables to the flapper
boxes and allows for their adjustment.  

The grand prize question is:  Are the late loaf heater cable adjusters
at the flapper boxes the same as the early Vanagon?  I don't imagine
that the adjusting hardware is available new, so I might have to ask
around for these parts.  Finding them would be much easier if I could
include loafs in my search.  Does anyone know for sure on this?  If you
have both an air-cooled Vanagon and a Bus, I'd be grateful if you
checked it out.

FWIW, if anyone out there has that hardware and wants to sell it or
donate it to the cause :-) please let me know.  To be more specific, I
have the cables and I have the flapper box.  What I need is the hardware
that attaches the cable to the flapper box.  It provides an adjustment
and I will need the nuts and bolts or whatever is used to attache the
cables to the hardware and the hardware to the flapper.  

I'm also gonna need new cables as mine are tweaked, so if anyone knows
of a good place to buy Vanagon heater cables, speak up please.  Ron?
Can you get those and how much?

Thanks all,
Sean
