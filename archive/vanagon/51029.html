&gt; RE:	Copy of: Re: Hidden Key &amp; Code
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;At any rate, I'd like to see the results of the great hidden key
&gt; &gt;search.

&gt; 
&gt; Well, all I got was a face full of dried up mouse poop and dirt when I
&gt; investigated the heater hose on my '75 westy.  No keys though.
&gt; 
*Careful* with that mouse poop! Seriously, someone died last year 
from cleaning up around mouse poop. Seems that inhaling it can result 
in some rare disease...

Probably a good idea to wear a mask whenever working around, which I 
often forget..
