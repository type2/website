Subject: 88 Westy Luggage Rack drainage

Hi all,

I've removed the luggage carrier from the top of my '88 Westy to 
replace the seal &amp; clean up some rust spots. (So far spent two nights 
removing all the old duct tape from the PO...) 

Anyway, I was looking at the way all the seals fit, and it appears 
that if the edge seal around the front &amp; sides were new and fit well, 
the only place the water could drain out from under the rack would be 
at the rear side corners. Is this the way it was intended? With the 
amount of liquid sunshine we get, I'm a little concerned that the 
water may drain to the rear &amp; soak the canvas if parked uphill. I was 
thinking of cutting a small slot in the rubber seal (just the rubber, 
not the whole strip) at each front corner. Anyone tried this?

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
