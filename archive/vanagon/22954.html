Subject: Syncro Tranny 

&gt;I'm having a difficult time getting into 1st (not ultra-low) from neutral
&gt;in my '87 Syncro. This makes town driving difficult, since I am using
&gt;ultra-low to 2nd gear shift to get moving. Any one else with this &gt;problem?
and a 
&gt;solution? Is my trans indicating it's about to go south for a vacation. &gt;I
suspect the problem is in the shift lever mounting up front, since I &gt;can get
into rev/ultra-low without pushing down on the stick. I've &gt;replaced one
plastic shift bush near the trans, but no great &gt;improvement. This never
happened in my '85 2WD, wah, why did I &gt;sell it?   tim s

Tim,

I had the same problem with my 87' Syncro just after I bought it
approximately 3 years ago.  The only way you could get it into first was to
push down on the lever and go.  The problem was with the the linkage
adjustment and not the tranny.  Follow Bently manual. Good luck.

Mike
