Subject:      oil leak

Hi all,

Now that the 1st has past and I've spent my paycheck on all the bills
already, I notice that my beloved vanagon has sprung an oil leak.

Not sure of the extent of it, just started today, but it left a nice
little puddle at the grocery store (maybe 5 inches diameter) and was
dripping after I turned the engine off when I reached home.
Approximately 1 drop every 5 seconds.  I checked the dip stick, although
the engine was still hot so it wouldn't be accurate, and I got oil on
it, but not where I'd like to see it (does it show too high or too low
when it's hot?)  No light or buzzer went off while driving.

Anyway, the drip emerges just about smack center under the engine.  Not
too sure where it starts.  --watch for technical terms-- the bottom part
of the big shiny thing at the bottom of the engine (may also be known as
the main engine part) had a thin coat of oil visible on the driver's
half of it as if the drip originated above it, on the driver's side,
somewhat towards the rear of the engine.  The top of the engine was oil
free so it wasn't splattering around while driving.  From the looks of
the bottom side, it doesn't --APPEAR-- as if the oil was dripping while
the engine was running.  There isn't any oil on the bottom/back of the
bumper or anywhere else that it SEEMS it could have gone if it was
dripping while driving.  There was also no smoke involved.

So, with this flimsy amount of information, before I bring it to the
dealer to be fixed (mine is reasonable most of the time), am I looking
at a major expense or minor?  It's time for the oil to be changed, but
doubt seriously that that is causing the leak :)

Thanks all!
