 Could having different tires in the front

Absolutely! You have to have all the exact same tires, definitely, on a
syncro. Some even say they have to have the same amount of wear on them too.
The cost of transgression is a fried viscous coupling. This means you have
to go to the bother of rotating your spare tire into the mix or it won't
wear like the others and will thereafter be damaging to use.
