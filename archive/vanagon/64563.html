Subject:      curtains for vanagon

Hello,

        Can someone suggest where I would find a good set of curtains for my
90 Vanagon ?  Are they sold by mail order ?  I didn't see any on offer by Bus
Depot on their website, so hopefully there are other suupliers.

        Any suggestions or comments are welcome.  Thanks !

-James
