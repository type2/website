Well, I went to the dealer and bought lights and the voltage regulator and
installed them all (about $30).  No effect.  So I decided to get drastic
and actually pulled the foil all the way out.  Sure enough, the $107 foil
had burned to save my 99 cent LEDs!  There is a trace on the foil
connecting pin 2 and pin 5 on the long connector, and it was totaly burnt. 
I took the wires going into the connector and connected them together. 
Now the temperature light continually blinks, and when I try to put my
brights on, they act like they do when the engine is not on -- they go
bright, but they don't stay bright.  The bright indicator does work.  BUT,
the dash illumination lights work &lt;grin&gt; Oh well.... Where is the relay
that controls the high beams?  Guess I'll go back to the fiche.... 

Oh, in desparation I paid the $84 and ordered a Bentley's.
I can't work without it.

Later,
