Subject: survey

My informal survey results turned up 9 responses.
5 said they didn't have the troubles I described, and
4 said they did.

The sample is too small to conclude anything.  
&lt;booo&gt; &lt;hiss&gt;  Get the hook!
However, since the sample is so small, I'd guess that it was not a 
widespread problem.  

Just a few people and most likely caused by resistance in the starter ground
circuit such as dirty contacts ANYWHERE between the battery and the starter
or too much draw somewhere else in the starting system (solenoid).

Later.
