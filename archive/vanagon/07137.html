Subject: Clutch problems: 1st, 2nd, ...
Date: Sun, 27 Nov 1994 05:23:18 -0700 (MST)

Hi folks,
A recent topic on the server is problems with getting 1st, 2nd, etc.
Well, although my vanagon did perform flawlessly to Red Deer ... 
(look on the map, it's pretty far north) till I put the oil cap on
incompletely (oil sprayed all over my rear, part 2), but my clutch -
transmission now begins to show problems.  Specifically, here are the
following symptons:
1st is hard to get ... and it always grinds when I try to get it.
2nd is getting harder to get
3rd ... 4th can be gotten with double clutching.
reverse: it got stuck there and would not come out for a while.
Sometimes I hit reverse trying to get 1st.  That's always a problem.
There is some leakage of (of all things, oil) around some type of thing
which is situated close to my starter motor.  It seems to be connected
to the clutch in some way.
Oh, probably one of the most telling symptons is this: the clutch does not
seem to fully disengage.
My wonderful mentor in things vanagon (Mark Johnson) says it's probably
the slave cylinder.  Does anyone else have ideas and also, where is a 
source for these things that won't force me not to eat for a while?
Thanks!
Stuart Hutton
