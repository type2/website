Subject: Do I have a CV joint problem?  82 Westy

I 300 yards across the San Mateo Bridge (the bridge is 7.5 miles long) 
when I got a flat tire.  The local transit authority insisted that I 
drive 3.5 miles to the nearest turnoff point.

I replaced the tire and within 50 miles was occasionally hearing a 
strange sound from the back of the van - ESPECIALLY when I make a right 
turn.

The sound is &quot;RrRrRrRrRrRrR&quot;.  Almost as if the tire were rubbing on 
something - but it's not.

QUESTION:  Are my joints bad?  Could my driving without the tire have 
done damage?  If it is a joint problem - do you recommend replacing all 
4 joints at the same time?
