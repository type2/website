Subject: Extended Warranty, Anybody heard of these people?

I got my Eurovan back at the end of August and roughly two months later 
recieved a letter offering an extended warranty on the van.  They 
offer different plans varying in cost from $400.00 to $600.00.  

Has anybody bought one of these, especially for a Eurovan?  The company 
offering it is AFI Management Comp. Inc.  &quot;A member of American Fidelity 
Group&quot;  if that adds any credibility.  Of course their correspondence 
only has 800 numbers and a P.O. Box.  (Do they not have a physical office???)
Has anybody ever heard of or dealt with them?

Now this is a van where a single caliper bolt is $8.50.

Any input would be greatly appreciated,
