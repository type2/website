Subject: how NOT to replace fuel hoses...
Date: Mon, 8 May 1995 01:58:06 -0500 (CDT)

Empty and drain your fuel tank before you attempt to replace them old fuel
lines!!! Don't relive my nightmare. 

I thought I had it all figured out when I finally decided to go ahead and
replace the last 2 segments: the one fron the tank to the filter and the
one from the pressure regulator back to the tank. Simply rest comfortably
under the tank, pull off the old hose, dexteritly hold the spout closed
with the right thumb, reach for the new hose, and then quickly push it
back onto the spout while leaving no more than a split second for gasoline
to escape. 

It just wouldn't work. The old hose was off and the new one refused to get
in place and the stuff comes gushing out all over my face and eyes and I'm
blinded, but I can't let go because another 9 gallons are still in there.
Half a gallon of gasoline later, the second attempt fails and I rest a
little, fighting off a panic attack. Then the third attempt fails, too,
and I'm *soaked* in gasoline. Finally the fourth attempt works, but, man,
I'm NOT proud of myself. I present myself with the &quot;Con du Jour&quot; award.
