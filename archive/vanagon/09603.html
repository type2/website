This is not a VW discussion so if you're not interested, hit 'd' now.

Well, if you haven't noticed in the news, we are getting quite
drenched out here in the west.  I would imagine most of the people
on the list that are on the west coast will not be coming into
work today due to the flooding.  I myself am typing this at home
on my crude but trusty VT220 and communication through a modem
that's connected to my workstation at work.  

I have to go out sometime today and get a sump pump and a heavy
duty backup pump.  

I had some fun this morning trying to rig my Polaris pool pump so
that it would help pump out the water from my sump.  After getting
everything hooked up right, I couldn't figure out a way to prime 
the pump which the Polaris must have. :(  I'm waiting for the traffic 
jams to dissapate before I go get a new pump.

Hope everyone else is okay.

Steven
