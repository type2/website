&gt; the alternator in my 79 is about to die.  I have called around to get
&gt; price quotes on rebuilt ones.  Pep Boys has one with a lifetime
&gt; guarantee for $62.  It is not Bosch, though.  Another place has a 
&gt; Bosch one for $131 plus $30 core charge.  I then called to get a quote
&gt; on a used one from a VW mechanic.  I told him about the Pep Boys
&gt; product and what it cost, and he basically screamed saying &quot;They
&gt; just keep breaking and cause harm to the fuel injection system.&quot;

I will never buy anything at Pep Boys again.  I've gotten too many
rebuilt parts from them in the past that have been worthless junk.
