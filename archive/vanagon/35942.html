I just got this:

&gt;Hello There:
&gt;
&gt;I was just looking at your web site this evening, and thought it was 
&gt;pretty cool what you have created.
&gt;
&gt;I am interested in knowing if you would consider letting us build a 
&gt;link to your site.  Maybe you have seen us or heard of us:
&gt;
&gt;			http://www.gexintl_dot_com			
&gt;
&gt;Please feel free to look at our site.  We are GEX International, 
&gt;manufacturer and distributor of VW high performance parts.  We are 
&gt;just getting ourselves linked up to all of the search engines, but 
&gt;already, we are getting lots of internet business!
&gt;
&gt;We feel that if we could build a link between our two sites that we 
&gt;would become a stronger force on the Internet, and give both of our 
&gt;sites more visibility.
&gt;
&gt;Please let us know if you would be interested in doing this.  If 
&gt;yes, we can do it for both of us right away.
&gt;
&gt;Hope to hear from you.  Please e-mail response back to 
&gt;dna_at_wesworld_dot_com.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a lot.
&gt;
&gt;Take care,
&gt;
&gt;Dawn Lambros
&gt;GEX International

Why would I want a link to GEX from my page?  I thought their stuff sucked?
At least I know people who told me their stuf sucked...

I wonder if Dawn is the betty they use in their ads?  Of course, she's been
in their ad since 197? !
