	Stuart,
	The chemical hand warmer idea sounds good! Remember, though,
that most plastic bags aren't actually solid bariers- moisture
and oxygen will diffuse across polyethelene. Use mylar or a metal
can and/or back-fill with dry nitrogen to be really sure one of
those chemical heating pads is out.

	BUT it sounds like a practical idea. Let us know if it
works!

	Bill
