It would really help if you said what year you would like them to be 
for.  I think are at least 4 different types of seatbelt latches that 
I've seen.  And I happen to have a couple from an '81 vanagon.

And while I have everyone's ear, it would be nice if people had thier 
vehicle, and location in thier .sig.  It reduces the guessing.  If 
someone needs help, I'm much more likely to offer my help (as in beyond 
Email help) if they're in the bayarea.
