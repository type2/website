Subject: Buy this Beetle, please!

Howdy all. I will spare you all the long sob story, but I shall just say that
an old girlfriend of mine, who decided I was unworthy of her company, has now
decided that her bug that I built for her is unworthy as well. Since I paid for
pretty much everything to begin with, she is selling it back to me instead of
someone else. But, with my own bus project, and the probablilty that I will be
traipsing about the country this summer, alas, I don't have time for it.
 Anyway, here are the details:
1969 Autostick Beetle, in Raleigh NC

good:
 new tires
 new brakes (completely)
 new windshieeld and seal
 NO rust
 only 1 tiny ding in the front fender
 nice paint

bad:
 she locked up the engine (hopefully rebuildable)
 autostick transmission
 some funky problem with the brakelight wiring.
 Upholstery was redone cheaply by PO, so it needs new seatcovers

Anyway, it is located in Raleigh, NC, and I am asking $800 for it, but that is
negotiable. That might seem like a lot for a car with a locked up engine, but
the body is pristine, and it will be an easy restoration for someone wanting a
classic Beetle. Anyway, I have to sell it soon, as I can't afford to have money
tied up in it, and I don't have a place for it.
Anyway, if anyone is interested, please let me know.
Thanks,
Richard
