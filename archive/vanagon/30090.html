Subject: Re: sport racks on Westys

[snip]
&gt;Why do you recommend the Thule gutter racks attached to the Vanagon gutters
&gt;and not the bolt-on fake gutters?  When I bought my Westy, it already had
&gt;these fake gutters attached.  I bought a Thule rack and am fairly satified.
&gt;You're right that it's difficult to put things on or take them off without
&gt;standing on something, but I have carried surfboards on the rack and you can
&gt;still pop the top without taking them off (kayaks also although I don't own
&gt;a kayak).  I also bought a ski attachment and can easily put skis or
&gt;snowboards on the rack without standing on anything.
I think the bolt-on fake gutters are fine for skis, boards, etc. but I
wouldn't want to put two or three kayaks (up there. Seems like too much
weight (and wind-induced stress) on the fiberglass. Am I being too
conservative? Is there a way to mount the fake gutters such that they
attach to something structural on the top (more substantial than just
fiberglass)?
