&gt;Thom - Just remember, if you remember the sixties, you
&gt;weren't a part of them!   :)

I didn't get it.  I was born in '67 - does that count?  I remember
going to Ocean Beach (San Francisco) as a kid, while my parents and
their buddies toked up, and they kept me quiet by feeding me cheap wine
which I would wash down with sand.  I remember that I loved to eat sand!
