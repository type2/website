Subject: Re: 1.9l Heads needed

Wow, AVP is on the list?!?

First Ron goes commercial, Bus Boys raises it's hand (so that all can aim
their catalog complaints) now I see a post from AVP!  All we need is Mark
Stephens to chime in...

So how about a discourse on your valve seats and Vanagon engine problems
and all?  Many past times there have been discussions on the list about the
merits (and demerits) of the three main Vanagon engine shops -- Fast German,
AVP and Mark Stephens.  Maybe you could do some Bob Hoover-isms about the
Vanagon engines since he really doesn't seem to love the Vanagon like he
does the old busses -- I *think* he likes the TypeIV engine &lt;but not the
parts prices or availability&gt; and doesn't like the wasserboxer.
