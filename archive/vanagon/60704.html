Subject: re: Spare parts in 2003

Hi Derek:

you wrote:
The big problem with spare part supply is mostly for the transmission pieces, 
right? 
Do we have reason to think that these should continue to be available from 
South Africa?

I can forward Ferdinand Piêch's office Fax Nr. to you if you want ...

You will propose this at that time and then SP will appoint you president of 
that division.

Good idea !! You are already looking forward to the discount for listees ? But 
I have well in mind what kind of expeditions you do with your syncro ! 
I would raise the prices for syncro parts a bit (let's say 200%) so that I 
will be able to afford a nice syncro then - because of my 1,000,000 $ annual 
salery. &lt;vbeg&gt;
For evry listee's adress they will pay me another 100$ so beware &lt;vbveg&gt;

Have to fix at least six free weeks a year - for syncroing on the SDP 
testing-area ! &lt;VBG&gt;

Wouldn't be too bad to work for them - they sometimes offer nice products 
indeed. 

Like they would have a nice range of potential 4x4 Van customers too, if VW or 
somebody else gave them a suitable basis to work on it. Only &quot;Van&quot; the are 
producing at the moment is the european version of the Chrysler Grand Voyager 
with 4x4 as well, but only for on-road use :-( 

So I'd prefer to be president a division where they make the combined Grand 
Voyager  with a Grand Cherokee chassis or the Mercedes Sprinter with a G-model 
suspension. 
Call it metamorphosis - department and give me 10% of the spare-part-dept. 
salery mentioned above and I'll do it.

(In fact I already worked for them indirectly - not on Transmissions but on 
sun-roof concepts ...)

Bye Tom N.
