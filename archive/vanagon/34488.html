Subject: Idle Selonid repair/Vent window 

Hi all. After a week of field testing a repair, I feel brave enough to post
it for your perusal!. About three weeks ago, I was backing up and hit a
snowbank, not uncommon here, the snowbank, not me hitting it!. Anyway as I
got to home, I got a lot of black smoke out the tail pipe and a real
stutter in the way the engine was feeling. Well, got up the driveway and
parked, not having the time or inclination to search and rescue. Remembered
this happened before when I munched the muffler hitting a low stone wall.
The O2 sensor had gone. Step One - got underneath and pushed the covering
wire back on. Okay that solved one problem. But now... the idle is at 2000
RPM and climbing....gosh darn, or words to that effect. Well, remembered
that my AAG (Awesome Automotive God) had suggested taking the idle selonid
switch, large cylinder right side of engine with wires going in from the
left and plumbing from the air cleaner/sensor on the right, and soaking it
overnight in carb cleaner, the plumbing side, not the wiring side!! I did
this covering about one half of the unit. Left in the solution over night,
took it out 24 hours later, timing is everything, and let it air dry for 24
hours. I replaced the unit and viola! Or words to that effect, it worked!!
The idle is now at a reasonable 1000 RPM, and I seem to have more power. I
have tested this for my beloved '86 Westy Syncro and offer it to the
masses. Now my question. The driver's vent window will not stay open,
pushed about 75 degrees to let a nice breeze in, at highway speeds. On
Prince Edward Island this occurred. We were cruising along and plop, it
closed. I can't seem to find any adjustment or other means of tightening it
down. Any ideas? Also I would like to find a shutter with cover for my
electrical outlet. Finally, any 67 squarebacks for sale/trade for a 67
sedan? I also want to thank those who send me messages on my previous
request. To those new syncro owners, it took us a full year to shake all
the problems out of Siegfried from the PO. Hang in there, they're worth
it!!
I bus, therefore I am
        Mike Elkavitch - 67 Deluxe Micro Bus, 86 Syncro Westy, 67 Sedan(new
home?), 91 Volvo 240 91 Explorer
