Subject: Re: California Emissions compliance in a 1990 Vanagon

&gt;While people are talking about emissions stickers...
&gt;Several months ago, someone mentioned here or on rec.autos.vw that
&gt;certain years of vanagons sold in Canada had both us and canadian
&gt;emissions stickers.  Apparently because they are already EPA approved,
&gt;it is relatively to import a Canadian Vanagon into the us...presumably
&gt;including Vanagon Single Cabs and Double Cabs.  Does anyone remember any
&gt;of the details of this?
&gt;

I have heard the same thing regarding late model Canadian/US Vanagons (fer
cripes sake, they imported so few of them, it'd only make sense to build
them to the highest common denominator), but have no more details.

What you can do however, if you find a vehicle that interests you, is call
VoA and give them the VIN. They will then tell you if the bus is okie dokie
for the USA, and send you the letter you'll need to get it through customs.
