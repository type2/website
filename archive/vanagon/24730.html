Subject: RE: Analog Mouse


&gt;I live in the middle of farm land, park my 84 GL in a
&gt;machine shed with a concrete floor.  Field mice are always a
&gt;problem in boxes (etc.) but last year they invaded my
&gt;Vanagon ventilation system.
    (snip)
&gt;The last thing I want to do is kill them and smell dead
&gt;mice.  I drive the Vanagon every day, apparently the warmth
&gt;attracts them.


We had that problem in the hills east of San Jose... until we got a cat.
Poof-- never saw/heard/smelled another mouse.

OTOH, we lost the opportunity to double the power of the engine with
a mouse treadmill... (sigh)
