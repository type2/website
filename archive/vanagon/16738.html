Subject: Re: Ethics / Radar Gun


&gt;&gt; &lt;i actually was going to buy a radar gun for this express
&gt;&gt; purpose!! until i found out how much they cost!!! :(  &gt;

Those of you who want it I will xerox and send a copy of the plans for this 
sort of thing. Beware! I believe you need FCC approval before you open your 
own Radio Broadcasting Facility. To cover K and X bands, on both 
polarization planes, you need 4 diode oscillators, $150 each, plus the rest 
of the components. PCB patterns are included, or you can/could buy the 
boards pre-etched. Includes wheel velocity pickups so you can set your 
apparent speed to some percentage of real speed, or have a constant output. 
You also needed a detector as an input trigger, to switch the unit on when 
police radar was detected, or leave it on fulltime. If I had a Ferrari and 
good roads I could afford this addition.
        Predating the LASER was the MASER, standing for microwave 
stimulation etc. Make yourself a MASER radar cannon, burn the receiver 
diodes out of the police radar units and do us all a favor. If you're going 
to all this effort why use it for defensive purpose, go for the kill. Beam 
me up Scotty.    tim s.


Regarding the ethics discussion, it's the owners call, so let it go. 
Sometimes my van is left unlocked, othertimes not. It is not for anyones 
convenience other than my own. I admire the notion of providing a safe haven 
for folks, but if you relinquish the notion of private property then be 
prepared to do so 100%. And be prepared to forgo your 'possesions' if they 
become someone elses. A locked strongbox in an otherwise empty van would 
incite anyones curiosity, and may lead to vandalism and/or theft.
        There is an experiment on the go in Holland to provide hundreds of 
'free' bikes for people to use, pickup and dropoff where needed. I doubt it 
will last long term due to peoples' need to possess things, but it is also a 
great notion.
