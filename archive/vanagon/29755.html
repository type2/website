 '54 barndoor standard:

He lowered it, to the ground.  Put in a bug transmission and
some type of adapter thingy.  Cut and turned the front beam.
Took the 16&quot; wheels, and had them cut and widened, to 6&quot;
in the front, 8&quot; in the back.  He's running 40 series rubber.

This is the same guy who, when I told him he was missing
his fresh air tubes (different bus) said &quot;So?&quot;

I thought that crap went out of style ,  until I saw a guy in town who pulled
out the original interior panels from his 65 micro, and cut out the metal
behind the front bench seat, and put in Toyota seats. Bleahh.  It looked
really nice, before he did that.   Wierd thing, the guy was really unfriendly
and stuck up too.  I'm always trying to meet more bus people,  and 99% are
friendly good vibe people.

Duh.   Lack of brain.   He's probably under the influence of the cheesy
photos in HotVWs and thinks a slammed sano bus with neon paint will catch the
hot babes, doooode.

Stupid too, with a barndoor, not just the hack job, but the next owner is
going to curse him, when they try to restore it.  At $100 a 16&quot; rim.....
     etc.   I have talked to some people trying to fix up some pretty
desperate old barndoors, too.

who's making bumper stickers?   How bought one that says &quot;Butcher a bus - go
to jail  It's the law&quot;  or  &quot;Friends don't let friends lower busses&quot;
