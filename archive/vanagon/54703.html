Subject: coolant leak

Hi All,
My 85 Westie is experiencing a coolant depletion from the resevoir behind the 
licence plate, it isn't causing the light to blink on the temp gauge 
anymore but did so at first...there are no visible signs of coolant 
leakage onto the ground and no loss of power or anything while 
driving. I'm considering taking it in for a full pressure test, also 
I'm only getting about 15 mpg...could these be the symptoms of an 
internal leak? Thanks for any advice,
Rick
