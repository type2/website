Subject:       Re: Rain-x

Hi Everyone.  I haven't use Rain-X, but I use a product called 
RainAway, by Wynns.  I use it on the all the windows, headlights, and 
mirrors.  I have been using this stuff since 1985, and have been very 
pleased.  I even wipe down the rubber on the wiper blades with it... 
you should see all the crap that comes off those blades!!  The 
windshield becomes absolutely streak free, and perfectly clear.  

I would think that if the windshield is still smeary, that maybe the 
wiper blades should be replaced.  I just changed my blades on the car 
after 7 years last year.  So, I guess this stuff preserves the rubber 
as well??!!

I usually redo the application every 4 to 6 weeks.  I live on the WET 
coast (Vancouver, BC), and I use the wipers a lot.

&gt; 
&gt; So has anyone ever had any good results with this stuff
&gt; on your windshield, I suggested that I and quite a few
&gt; of my friends had not on the corrado list, and nearly
&gt; everyone jumped to the products defense.  Personally I
&gt; find it to usually decrease visibility when using wipers
&gt; and lead to more streaking unless you do it nearly weekly.
&gt; I use it on side windows with great results, but never on
&gt; front or rear glass.  It's been a while since I've used it
&gt; on a windshield though so if I get some more positive reviews,
&gt; maybe I'll give it another go, the only problem is IMHO the
&gt; crap can not be removed if I don't like it so I'm stuck until
&gt; it wears off.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone with some thoughts?
