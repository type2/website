Subject: Looking for Camper EV?

For anyone looking for EV camper to purchase -- 


Saw what I assumed to be 2 white EVs, apparently campers because they appeared
identical and one had a  &quot;pop-top&quot; raised to the open position.   This was on
Saturday, 5/11/96.

This was seen from US 101 on the South edge of Santa Rosa.  These vehicles
were on a VW dealer's lot on the West side of the highway.  Since I was
driving, I only got a glimpse as we tooled on by.
