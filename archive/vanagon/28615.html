&gt; I guess I want some opinions on the AOL, compuserve, etc debate.
&gt; I'm only looking for cheap email, but web browser capability, and
&gt; a newsreader would be nice.  Somebody who has looked into this recently
&gt; give me an idea.

Check out thelist_dot_com.  If you can get there from where you are, I can
forward you a copy of the list.  It has all the known providers on it!

Peraonally, I would stay away from the McProviders.  You only get the access
that &quot;they&quot; want you to have, all digested in an easy to swallow pablum.  It
doesn't take a &quot;rocket scientist&quot; to use one of the other providers... :)
