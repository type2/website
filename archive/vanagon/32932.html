Subject: Re: synthetic oil...


 
&gt;  so i'd like to hear about you experiences with this,
&gt;  maybe i should go to a different weight of oil...

86 Syncro, engine rebuild (including new heads) 1/93, _at_ 83k miles.

Currently have 117k miles, and have used Castrol Syntec 5-50 since
the rebuild. The oil has been changed every 3k miles, no oil problems, 
including leaks. Lifters do not tick.
