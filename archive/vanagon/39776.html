Subject: '72 steering box

I'm not sure yet, I havn't had a chance to take apart the seeering 
linkage and wiggle the arm yet, but I have a feeling that my  steering 
box is on the outs.  I tried adjusting it with no luck.  All my tie rods 
are in good shape and I just got new lower ball joints about 250 miles 
ago but the bus really wanders around on the road.  The system feels 
pretty loose when I am driving and I don't think it can be totally 
atributed to the low profile passanger car tires that some one put on the 
front.  If anyone has any ideas on rebuilds/solutions, or one sitting in 
the shed, please let me know.
Thanks.
Ed.
