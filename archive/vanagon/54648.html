Subject: Kelly Park show date confirmed~ April, 97

The Golden Gate chapter of the VVWCA will host the annual Kelly Park show
near/in San Jose, California on Sunday, April 6, 1997. Time of the event is
slated for 9AM-3PM. I will provide more info as it becomes available and may
post an appropriate phone number once I get permission to do so.
The VanBondo tribe tenatively is planning on making the drive over &lt;in the
'67RFH&gt; with several members of a local Phoenix vintage club.
April is awhile away but I personally had to plan ahead to get &quot;parole&quot; from
my job in order to attend...
