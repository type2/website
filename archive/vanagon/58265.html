Subject: F.S.'86 Westy $1000

For Sale:
'86 Wolfsburg Ed. Westy Weekender (WWW) or technically known as the &quot;Non-GL
Camper&quot; 
4spd, a/c, cruise, 130k, Merion Brown (dark brown), rear wiper, p.s.,
foglites, poptop, sofabed, fold out table, cabinet in LR.
westy GL sink/fridge cabinet added in the stock location.
2.1 liter engine? blown.
Body and interior? the owner of this well used camper spent his winters in
Vermont working at a ski resort for quite a few years.
(to answer what you're probably thinking now ....yes.)
this would be a great do- it-yourself project for a listmember with not a
whole lot of money, who wants a '86 up camper that needs some work at a cheap
price. 
$1000 bucks.
