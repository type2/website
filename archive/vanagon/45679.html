Wendy,

There is no need to run the heat during the summer, unless you are cold.
This only works on water cooled beasts, as the coolant passes thru a heater
core where the vent fan blows the hot air into the cabin of the vehicle,
thereby providing some cooling effect to the coolant.  So leave the heat off
unless you like torturing yourself with heat.

The sulfur smell you are encountering is most likely some oil that has settled
on, or in the heat exchangers, and is burning off.  If it does not subside in
a day or so, start looking for oil leaks around the area of the heat exchangers
as it is dripping on to them.  I am having the same problem, so unless it is
something else all together, that is it.

Hope this helps,

David

Hi all, After my breakdown a few weeks ago, it took me a couple weeks to
feel okay and get my bus back on the highway. I had driven about 120 miles
or so, when I noticed the smell of sulfur wafting up through the defrost
vents. I had someone tell that it's a good idea to run some heat in hot
weather to draw hot air away from the engine (true? legend?).

Anyway, I didn't have any other problems; in fact it ran great, but I'm a
little nervous about *that smell*...

Any advice??? TIA


Wendy
