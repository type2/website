Thom,
I would be interested in a price breakdown of your entire
project.  I know that it would be a bit of a bitch to do 
but I'm contemplating something along the same lines that
you are doing.  ie: doing my own body work and painting.
So far I managed to fix the sliding door lock.  It wasn't
attached to anything and was just hanging there and 
bothering me.  I fashioned a rubber gasket for it by
xacto-ing a hose washer to fit and replaced the screw that
had worked loose somehow reassembled the works and now it
works!  I was so filled with my own ability that I started
removing the cedar paneling form the rear inside top to get
at the hole the PO had hacked into the roof in order to put
a vent in.  Daydreaming about learning how to do my own body
repair and everything.  Can you suggest a good read that would
inspire me to continue on?  --Ralf
