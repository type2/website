Subject: suspension and brakes upgrade for 84 vanagon

i have put a chevy 2.8l v-6 into my 1984 vanagon.
i need stronger brakes and a better suspension system.

i talked to the people at KEP and for the brakes they advised me to use the 
front disk brake setup on the rear wheels, but they only had experience 
with busses.  i forgot to ask them about the suspension.

i was thinking that maybe i should get 15&quot; wheels so that bigger disks 
could fit, but i am running BFGoodrich all-terrains to go through the mud 
and snow, and i don't think i can get 27&quot; tires for the 15&quot; wheels.

and for the suspension, maybe dual rate(like the dirt-track 
racing pickups) or variable rate(if they are available) coil springs with 
Rancho RS9000 shocks at all four corners.

what do all y'all think?
