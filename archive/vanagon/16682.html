Subject: Windshield washers

I got one of the readily available electric washer motors from yer basic USA
church of auto parts stores and epoxied it to the top of the tank and ran
the hose into the tank.  Switch goes on the dash and I got good washer
stream always.  Compressed air washers, what were they thinkin?  Sure,
endanger the integrity of your spare tire- (at least in the sedans and
squarebacks) whatever, just squirt some of this on your windshield.  

Don't even bother trying to get the right hose, even if you fix it it never
worked right to begin with.

Eug,
