&gt;From: David Schwarze &lt;schwarze_at_io.nosc_dot_mil&gt;
&gt; &gt; And BTW, why are those suckers so outrageously expensive in the first
&gt; &gt; place? It's just a bunch of pipes and sheet metal, isn't it? Not some high
&gt; &gt; precision performance part?
&gt; 
&gt; Yup.  Just a question of supply and demand.

Has anyone ever taken one apart?  I thought that the reason they were so
high was because of the way they are made.  From memory,  I think that 
it is casted with the heat sinks part of the pipes, welded and covered
up with sheet metal.  I don't know if the manufacturing process is what
drives up the price considering it is just pipes and sheet metal.
