&gt; &gt; 	Such a waste, it makes me sick to my stomach that such things go 
&gt; &gt; on in America.  I guess it is the unintended fualt of the legal system.  
&gt; &gt; Such vehicles could easily make the lives of some one less fortunet than 
&gt; &gt; us much better, esp the BMW.  They run the engines dry? ech.  
&gt;  
&gt; 	Walt, I've got to agree that its a waste, but the problem isn't
&gt; lawyers, per se. We, the people, sitting on juries and passing laws
&gt; and becoming judges, that is: making decisions, have created the system
&gt; we have. Lawyers are mouthpieces, advocates and potentially dispassionate
&gt; observers. Of course they piss people off. But half the lawyers
&gt; are on the loosing side EVERY TIME.
&gt; 	I'll argue that infotainment TV, from 60 Minutes to Entertainment
&gt; Tonight, is actually evil, if scape-goats are wanted...
&gt; 	But lots of companies won't sell damaged goods at any price-
&gt; some even destroy their R&amp;D prototypes after they finish getting loan-out
&gt; evaluations. MusicMan did this with some prototype electric bass guitars
&gt; about 15 years ago. On balance, this perogitive of property rights
&gt; is more a good thing than bad, I think.

	Your absolutely right, of course, we did create this system and 
we must live with it.  From my perspective, I don't see any real changes 
coming, at least in my life time.  As my dad said, and probably most 
others too,&quot; You (we) made your (our) bed, now you () have to sleep in 
it&quot;. 
	 The thing I lament though, is overall effect this has on our living 
conditions, especially in light of the &quot;new world order&quot; that is upon us, 
where we throw things to the crusher out of fear, even if it still has 
some positive value for someone or something(?).  How does this make us 
look to those people in other nations who are strugling to feed their 
people and take care of their homes?  I kind of fear that this built in 
fear in our litigiuos system will have a detrimental effect on us as a 
nation when those little countries grow up and start to really share the 
resorces--not just the tin from that westy, but also from the tooling, 
building, labour, packaging, and everything else involved in bringing a 
product to market.  blah blah blah.....  Then I've always believed that 
things will work out in the end so why worry?  I think I'll go home to 
the bed that I made, my own westy.

		BTW, sorry for the dribble, it is just my fear of the up 
coming GRE's.
