	hello everyone,

		i`ve been reading, watcing, observing and even sometimes
		replying on this newsgroup for about 2 months.  i have
		a problem imediately at hand.

		When i drive my baby, i &quot;feel&quot; as if my rear right tire
		is stuck, it started occuring right after i parrell 
		parked and hit the curb (not that hard mind you) with
		that tire.  Also my emergency brake has not been 
		holding lately. 
		Also we i turn the ignition key to the on position
		my rear right brake light stays on. i pushed the 
		brake pedal and both went on but the right just 
		stays on.  Somehow, my brake is stuck in the on
		position?

		i refered to both Muir and Benteley and will adjust
		and bleed my brakes this evening.  is there anything
		else i should do tonight or just do this and see
		if my problem is solved.

	
				thanks

					kevin 74 camper

		P.s.  hope to see everyone this weekend at the 
		      Ben &amp; Jerry`s VW show.
