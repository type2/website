Subject:      It's showing up in the template, too, Chris..

Fifteen seconds. Fastern blue blazes, ain't it? ;)

This is in the welcome file, too:

&gt;Your  subscription  to the  VANAGON  list  (No  title defined)  has  been
&gt;accepted.

I know how to fix it in the (mail) headers you asked about, and I know how
to kludge it here, but it's gonna pop up in a hundred other places--it
smells like something was left out when you ran the config program.

Somewhere there's an .rc file or an .ini file or whatever NT uses, the
variable in there needs to be changed, I think. It's probably called TITLE=.
