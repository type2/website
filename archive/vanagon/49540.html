Subject: '82 diesel, drive belt


        Has anyone replaced the timeing belt (Bentley calls it a drive belt)
themselves.  The local VW dealer service dept. is months behind and they
have already put me off twice.  

        I realize that the belt tension is very important.  Is the tool
recomended in the Bently book avaible, is there a better tension tool?

        I have also been told to replace the tensioner pulley when I do
this.  Is there anything else that I should keep in mind?
