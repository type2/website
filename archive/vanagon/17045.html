Subject: Alas, Van for Sale


I'm sorry to have to say that my 87 Vanagon and I must part ways. We have 
had many adventures together. I've owned her for six years, but I need an 
eight spark plugger now to pull a trailer. 

She's very clean inside and out and has been very well cared for. I have all 
the maintenance records. She just had her R&amp;P steering replaced, so that's 
brand new. She has recent brakes, battery. She has the &quot;weekend package&quot; 
with the fold down double bed, very comfy. Silver/Gray in color. She needs 
tires and has the expected leaking head gasket. 122K miles. Drive away. 

How about $4500. 

I'm in the Bay Area, California. Please email me directly as I can't read 
all the msgs. :-(
