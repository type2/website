&gt; OK, we love our '93 MV, at c. 25,000 nothing major has failed although a
&gt; fair number of interior bits have fallen off (and been easily re-attached),
&gt; but it's really not a  GTI Rick...........the &quot;design bogie&quot; was the Ford
&gt; Transit.....

EV handles well for a van but its not a sports car.  Handles far better 
than any mini-van (tall stationwagon) I've ever driven.  Handles nearly 
as well as my small truck even though its feet taller.  It handles VERY 
well  as far as I'm concerned.  Okay my old Chrysler Conquest handled 
better, so?

&gt; Rick's right, the OEM tires aren't great. Ours will probably last another
&gt; 5K-7K, but traction (wet or dry) is not great.

I love the Goodyears that came on mine.  Suckers don't slip wet dry or 
icy.  Don't know about the wear life.  Only some 24000 miles on the EV.

&gt; Rick under states the EV heating/cooling system: separate
&gt; blowers/exchangers/controls fore and aft, drive you out of the bus heat in
&gt; short order.....Surely Duane Moore up there in Alberta has &quot;EV heater lust&quot;
&gt; :)

S\Drove the EV up to the Poconoes this weekend.  Roasty toasty!  No 
sliding on the ice and snow either.
