Installing long block in the 81 westy.  Everything going reasonably well,
except the exhaust manifold didn't line up too well with the left head.
Eventually coaxed on.

Hook up all plumbing and wiring, and ready to start it up for break in.

DON'T TRY THE FOLLOWING AT HOME, KIDS:

        Cranked her up and it starts but is running very rich with thick
black smoke belching out of the exhaust, and is running very unevenly.

A day later I realized that I had reversed two electrical connectors -- the
one to the auxilary air valve with the one to the cold start valve.  As some
of you probably know, these two connectors are located right next to each
other and even have the same type of plug, almost inviting cross-connection.  

Swapped the cables and it ran like a champ.

What was it again that Muir said about labelling all the connectors as you
take them off?
