&gt;Any suggestions of where the leak might be coming from?  They tell me 
&gt;that the vent tubes in there feel solid so they don't think that the 
&gt;problem is coming from there.  And I don't think Caron will wear a gas

The best thing to do would be take the panel out and look at the tank.
 Getting it out will  not be easy but it can be done with a flat engine in
place.  You might have what I had on the '72, a dry rotted rubber elbow that
cost about $3 from VW (special order, of course).
