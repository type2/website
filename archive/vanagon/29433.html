Subject: ye olde PC debate

Darn those pesky progressives!  The English language should have stayed 
the same once Beowulf came out.  Those durned Normans had no respect for 
'traditional values'!    Smite them! Smite them all!

By the way, how would Grendel say:
I just bought a '71 Westfalia, and I love her!  Anybody got a spare rear 
bumper bracket?
