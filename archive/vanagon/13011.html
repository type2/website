When David S. and I visited his local VW parts store in San Diego, they
also sold me the same type of aftermarket seal and assured me that it
would be fine for an 82. I have not yet had a chance to put it on but it
does appear to be of high quality although of different design. They sold
me the front trim as well as the rear part plus instructions. The part
number is 231-708WCM. The instructions indicate that a thin film of
adhesive should be used on both the seal and the pop-top and that the seal
should not be stretched.

They don't mention any type of adhesive specifically, but I had good luck
with windshield cement - reapplying the old seal which now comes off :(  -
it is permanent though so you need to work quickly and accurately.

On another note - the weather is expected to get above plus 5 C tomorrow
and that means getting the Westy out of storage! First thing though is to
crawl underneath and find out exactly where the clutch fluid is leaking. I
have now checked the master cylinder and it is not leaking. The other
possibilities are the connnection between the felixible hose and the slave
or the slave itself. One sure sign of a leaking master or slave is fluid
in the rubber seal so I will be checking there as well. There has been a
lot of talk about rebuilding cylinders - this seem to be the best option.
The other item on the agenda is installing the thermostat that Norman Leong
sent my way. The thermostat will control the flow of oil to the second oil
cooler and help keep the temps between 85 and 95 C.
