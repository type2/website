&gt; &gt; 	I don't follow why this is such an absurd price. I sold a '91
&gt; &gt; 	2-wheeler Camper with 44K miles for $21K a few weeks ago. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	I'd  expect to pay $2 &gt; 5K more for a 4-wheeler.

&gt; 
&gt; Amazing.  Now I understand why twice, upon seeing my '91 Synchro
&gt; camper, folks have offered me &gt;$20,000 on the spot.
&gt; 

	Vern, I believe the resale value for the late model Camper GLs
	stayed high after the last unit was imported in '91 was due to:

	-No replacement in '92, '93 or '94 model years.

	-The unique position of the VW Camper in the marketplace.

	-The high cost of the '95 EuroBago camper along with the
	 perceived drawbacks of the EuroVan.

	-The romance attached to the rear-engined beast. 

The west-coast versions of Kelleys BlueBook and the yellow NADA book lists
the Camper high. I don't know about the east coast.......

The people that paid me $21K considered the EuroBago, but opted for a Vanagon
due to lower cost and romance, I believe.
