Jim,

I remembered the advice to do this, AFTER I had removed the torsion bar 
and spring plate. 

Bently says the spring plate should sit at a 23 degree angle to 
horizontal. Because I didn't mark the position of the spring plate I will 
have to break out the spirit level and the protractor. I don't have one 
of those bubble protractors shown in Bently.

My real problem, and the reason for the sag in my rear end, is a crack in 
the right rear torsion bar. The paint on the torsion bar was peeling off. 
The surface of the bar had a lot of rust pitting (sp?). I started to 
clean up the bar to repaint it and when I got to the last bit (of course) 
I noticed the crack. It is about 1/2&quot; long and about 4&quot; away from the 
outside end of the bar, at an angle of about 45 degrees and I can see 
hairline cracks running along the bar from each end of the crack. The 
crack has opened up about 1/8&quot; in the middle.

I am now on the track of a red torsion bar. There are three wreckers in 
this town and each has a kombi in it, one has two. None are the same model 
as mine, three are earlier and one is later. I have a '72 model with 
rectangular tail lights and the low front blinkers, but I know that my 
chassis is about 1&quot; wider than the earlier bay window VWs. I had one 
wrecker pull a torsion bar (after I explained to his man how to do it) 
from a later model (high squarish front blinkers) and the bar was green. 
I have now asked another one to pull a bar from an earlier bay window  
(oval tail lights), again after I showed him how to do it. I will have to 
wait to see what colour the bar is. 

I know that I can get one from Sydney for $35 plus freight ($15 - $25). I'm 
hoping that I can get one locally for the same price, without the freight cost.

Does anyone know what the differences are between the various colours of 
torsion bars as regards the different models of bay window VWs?

Thanks in anticipation.
