Mark Twain National Forest  or  Ozarks Nat. For  or  Ouachita Nat. For.

I can't decide which area to visit for the 4th.  Has anyone spent time
in these locations?   I am want to camp, mtn bike and white water raft.
Which of these area offer these activities?   The Mark Twain area was
suggested because of its closeness to ST Loius.   I thought I could
spend a few nights in St Louis and them travel to on of the forest
areas.   
Beside the Arch what else would you do in St Louis?
Music, Plays, Airplane Museums, Vw shows? 
Any suggestions will be appreciated.
