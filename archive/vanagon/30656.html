Subject: Soldering iron: a recommendation

With the discussion of soldering irons, I want to tell you about
one I keep in my toolbox that I highly recommend.

It is a butane powered &quot;pen&quot; style unit made by Archer. It is a
very convenient soldering iron to use because you don't need 110V
to run it.

I don't think this unit would have any residual voltage, but I've
never used it on sensitive electrical components.
