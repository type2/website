I hope that someone can clear up a little more confusion about these
tires:  The list has been recommending both Yokohama Y370 and Y370G
tires, but the ones that Sears got from the warehouse in Atlanta are
Y370B tires; The Sears tire guy says that the letter &quot;G&quot; or &quot;B&quot; isn't
important, is he right?  What is the difference between:

Yokohama Y370 LT195/75R14 (8 ply) part number 37047
Yokohama Y370G LT195/75R14 (8 ply) part number 37047
Yokohama Y370B LT195/75R14 (8 ply) part number 37047

besides the final letter in Y370?  I noticed that the Y370B tires
don't have whitewalls, but that's not important to me because I would
turn the whitewalls inside anyway.  Should I buy them?
