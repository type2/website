Subject: low compression on cylindar #3 of 2.1 liter


Wanted to post to the list my situation with one of my vans.  I did a
compression test on the 2.1 liter engine and got within spec readings on
cylinders 1, 2, and 4.  On #3, I got a low reading of about 15-25 psi.  I
tried the drops of oil in the cylinder and retested, but still got the same
low reading.  It sounds like a definate valve problem.  Perhaps a spring,
clip, or valve is damaged on the #3?  Has anyone else experienced this
before?  All mechanics I've consulted in the area want to pull the head of
r&amp;r the valves and the head which will cost about $500-600.  Of course this
may fix the problem, but it seems like it could be overkill.  Has anyone
just replaced the valves on one side of the engine and gotten the
compression back to spec?  Does anyone know the procedure and have it
written down for someone that hasn't done it before but they could follow
it?

Please reply directly to me as well as the list, my crappy email keeps
booting me off the list.
