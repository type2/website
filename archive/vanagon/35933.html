Who the Hell is Matty J.? you ask.

Well, He's the guy from the East Coast who's on a
tour to see how many vanagon list geeks he and is
girlfriend can meet.  He'll be in Sacramento on Saturday
and will be looking for a camper to purchase.  The only
trouble spot is that we're not sure how he should go about
registering it.  Should he go to to Nevada and register it
there?  Any ideas?
