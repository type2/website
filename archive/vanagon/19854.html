Subject: Ciao for now and European rentals

I'm off to Stuttgart this PM to spend 20 days in a new Eurovan Westy.
Probably hit Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, some of Poland, Slowakia and Cz Rep,
then back to Stuttgart.

By the way, for those who are interested in a not-too-expensive European
vacation, the rental rate for a Westy is DM 2740 for 20 days if you rent in
the mid-season. At present rates, about US$ 100/day. The type of season
depends on the province and its school vacation dates (vacation = high
season). For some strange reason Baden--Wuertemburg doesn't start its
school vacation until 26 July.

These rates are inclusive; you pay diesel fuel, and in the case of an
accident that's your fault, the first DM 1000. That's all. (That's enough).

The way to get the best rates is to deal directly with the firm in Germany:

        Deutsche Reisemobil
        22850 Hamburg-Norderstedt
        Segeberger Chaussee 3
        Fax: (49) 40-52-48-66-8
        Tel: (49) 40-52-01-84-71

Fax is best, because then there are no language problems (there's always
someone who speaks English). Yes I realize the tel. #s are unequal in
length.

Pick-up points are Hamburg, Berlin, Duesseldorf, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and
Munich.

No I don't work for them; this will be my second rental, though. Worked
fine last time.
