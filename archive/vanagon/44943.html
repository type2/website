Subject: Re: some big trouble with a locking gas cap

&gt;i've got a friend with '74? bug that has an aftermarket gas cap that locks..and
&gt;he has lost the keys to the cap...and is outta gas...what's the best way to get
&gt;the cap off without majorly damaging anything......i think i'll get rid of my
&gt;locking gas cap and find an original..what the heck can you do if the keys are
&gt;gone?

        Just drive it to the local locksmith, and they'll make a key for
about $15-20. Assuming of course that you have any fumes left in the tank.

Peace,
