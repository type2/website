Hello Jim, and everyone, and thanks to all that took the time to answer my 
questions, but Im not done yet!  I yet another question, this one regarding 
the diesel coolant tank.
 I have an '82.  The part # for the tank is 068-121-405B.  Does anyone 
know where one can be located?  The '83 has TWO part #'s, one is 
068-121-405D, Will this work in my van?  Ive located one for _at_1/2 of the 
dealers cost.  Someone I spoke with told me the &quot;B&quot; tank was a &quot;dealer only&quot; 
part. Any answers?
Thanks for your help,
Paul Cronin
'82 Diesel
