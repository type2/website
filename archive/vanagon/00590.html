&gt; This is exactly what my post recommended (2 4ga cables running in parallel
&gt; for EACH terminal). Another poster suggested using single 8 or 6ga cable;
&gt; we're talking liquid copper here. Your dealer was wise.

Ummm... that was me, and I feel I have to put in a word here to defend
myself.  Here is a quote from my previous article:

&quot;              ...  If it puts out 1200 watts that means it is requiring
more than 100 *amps* from your battery at full load, and probably at least
60 amps running the microwave (including conversion-related losses). I
would first check that you are using wire large enough to support a 100 amp
load (I would guess at least 8 gauge, probably 6) to hook it up. &quot;

I said to use wire large enough to support a 100 amp load, and proceeded
to take a *guess* as to what that would be.  I did not mean to imply that
6 or 8 gauge is the best choice, in fact I am all for overkill, and would
probably use 4 gauge like Werner suggested.  However, many foreign cars
use 6 gauge wire for their main starter hot wire, and I still think that
6 gauge wire can probably handle 100 amps with a reasonable margin of
safety.  I wouldn't stake my life (or even my bus) on it, nor would I
recommend that anyone else do the same.  In any case, the original poster
(Richard) did the right thing and consulted an expert.
