&gt; Has anyone tried this product? It is suppose to increase the heat transfer
&gt; properties of the radiator water and they claim up to a 30-degree drop in
&gt; water temp. Just curious if anyone has experience with this product.
Just bought some, will report results. Looks very promising if performs
as well as all the racers claim.
