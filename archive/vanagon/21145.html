&gt; flat out, no.  several reasons... first and foremost in  my mind is 
&gt; light quality.  i had the flourescent in my '85 and incandescent in 
&gt; the '87.  with the fl. light, everyone looked dead, it was VERY slow 
&gt; to start in winter (a relative term i understand), and hummed a 
&gt; little.  the incand. light is warm (makes one want to fool around and 
It is true that one of the lights that I got from Wall Mart did turn
a bit bluish during extreme cold (about 25-30 below) but it was on the
end of the circuit so probably there was some voltage drop in the cable
connecting the light.  However, I have not really had a problem with
the quality of light and dead looking people.  We often use these lights
to fully illuminate the camper while we play cards with our friends
in the mountains.  We could not afford to use the normal lights for so
long.  I also have two of these lights mounted over the engine so that
I can see at night when I have to stop and do something to the engine.
And, in fact, I do use these lights for reading without problem.  But,
maybe I am more tolerant of these lights than most people.  If I were
at home, I would only use incandescent lights since energy considerations
are not important.
