&gt; Stuart this is a common problem when temperatures are REALLY cold (-20C or
&gt; below), but its sounds like yours may be electrical. BTW I have a book
&gt; that describes a few noises that may help diagnose your engine noise if
&gt; it ever comes back...DC -- 
David, amazingly enough, Hey! you're right.  It is really*** cold out
there tonight!  That's where an electric heater comes in.
