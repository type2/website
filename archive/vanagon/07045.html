Subject: RE: 911 engine conversions

Dave Kautz asks about the flywheel and related parts.  This is actually the
easy end of the engine.  Kennedy Engineered Products makes flywheels with VW
dimensions except a Porsche center.  Pure bolt-in (and a BEAUTIFUL piece of
metal).  I'm using stock disk, pressure plate, trans, starter, you name it.
The other end of the engine, where you need to fabricate a hanger, is trickier.

Regarding the late 70s fit:  The Porsche engine is taller than the Type 4 pan-
cake, especially if you use a CIS engine.  On the Vanagon, all the extra 
height is within the bounds of the engine lid, so you need to modify an engine
lid, not the van.  The breadloafs either have no hatch over the engine (&quot;Gen-
tlemen, start your Sawzalls&quot;) or a hatch that I think may be too small.  So
you would need some bodywork on the back deck to get the extra inches of air-
space you need over the engine.

Your van's a little lighter and more aero than a Vanagon, tho': Could be hot!
