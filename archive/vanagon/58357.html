Subject: What's the size of the front table
Date: Sun, 13 Apr 1997 21:21:37 -0400

The 88 Westy that I recently acquired didn't have the front table or leg. 
I have acquired the proper 
post for the front table and a table for the rear (that I can use the
hardware from).  What I would like
to know is ... What are the dimensions of the front table that Westfalia
include with a camper 
package of this vintage?  I'll probably craft one out of plywood.

TIA
