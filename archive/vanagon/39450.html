I have seen this on dune buggies/Baja bugs, but never on a bus. Off the top
of my head, if I were doing it I would:

fabricate longer cables;
rig fairleads to bring the cables into close parallel;
fabricate new bottom hinge for two stock vertical bars;
new top plate to carry two ratchet bars;
new handles to clear each other.

A lot of work, but it could be done.  OTOH,  if I did such a thing, the
temptation to see if a bootlegger's turn was possible in a bus would be
almost irresistable &lt;grin&gt; but not too smart.
