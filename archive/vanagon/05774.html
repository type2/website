Subject: Re: '72 Bus Starter Problems

&gt; Howdy Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; My '72 Westy, Stimpy, is having problems starting.  When I get in and crank
&gt; the starter, it sounds like it or somepart of it is spinning, without
&gt; engaging the flywheel.  If I put Stimpy in gear, and rock it forward and

Sounds like either the Bendix gear (the part that engages the flywheel) is shot
or the solenoid is gone.  If the starter spins then you know it's good.  The 
solenoid is designed to push the Bendix gear into contact with the flywheel.  
If the solenoid's electromagnet's windings are shot or shorted then it won't
pull the iron core down to engage the Bendix.  

&gt; back (just a inch or two), it will then start.  I tested the battery at 

The other possibility rocking brings to light is that the flywheel itself is gone.
Over time the teeth on the edge of the flywheel can get ground down by engage-
ment with the Bendix gear.  Pull the starter and look in the hole in the bell housing
while kind friend turns the crank by hand.  If the teeth are gone in places, then it's
time to rent a transmission jack. 8(. So it goes.

&gt; the local FLAPS, but the result only said &quot;charge and re-test.&quot;  I went 
&gt; ahead and bought a new battery (the old one was over 5 years old), put it
&gt; in when I got home, and the exact same thing happens.  The generator light
&gt; doesn't come on when I'm driving, and I don't notice any other electrical
&gt; problems.  Any ideas?  I did a cursory examination of the starter/solenoid,
&gt; and didn't notice anything out-of-the-ordinary.  The solenoid was replaced
&gt; 16 months ago, but I suspect a different problem, since the symptoms are
&gt; different (Bad solenoid, nothing happens.  This time _something_ is 
&gt; happening)
