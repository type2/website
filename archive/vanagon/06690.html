Subject: Re: ASCII map, fish recipie

&gt; 
&gt; Why ASCII.  Why not a Web page with map of the world.  Click on a dot, get
&gt; full color photo of van and owner, click again for full scanned repair history
&gt; with receipts.  Other hypertext jumps for each cat, musical instrument, 
&gt; fish dish, flannel pattern.  C'mon Joel, it's almost 1995, and whatever we
&gt; *can* do, we *must* do.  It's the Internet way.

	Gee, Bill, that sounds really neat! D'ya think it can be in stores
by Christmas?

	Lessee,
	I've got two cats, a bunch o' guitars, drum kit, bass guitars,
more than one fish recipie, and FLANNEL SHEETS! Ah, wild youth!

	Pan Blackened Cat Fish, reverse engineered by W. Abbott:

	(You'll need a good stove hood fan and its not a bad idea to 
disconnect the smoke alarm.)

	Start some nice italian vegetables first- squash, onions, mushrooms,
that kind of thing. Now put a stainless steel frying pan on the big burner,
on HI.

	Open up the paper package the butcher put the fish in and lay the 
filets out next to each other. 
	Dust them with ground oregano so that they're pretty much green.
	Dust THAT with ground cayene pepper, and use a lot of it.
	Add black and white ground pepper if you didn't use much cayene.
	Top it all with paprika.

	Turn the fish over and do the same thing to the other side.

	When the frying pan is as hot as its ever going to get, TURN ON
THE FAN, then identify the outside of the filet (Its the smooth side, the
inside has a dent where the bones were) and lay the filets down in the pan,
skin side down. Note: no butter, no margarine, no PAM, no olive oil. Just
way-hot steel and catfish with an ablative coating of spices. Thats why
the oregano goes on first and the peppers outside. You'll get a little
fat out of the skin side of the filet, and that's all you need.

	Flip 'em after about 1 minute, or when the smoke thins. Cooking
time depeneds on thickness of fish, heat, etc. but the high heat sears the
fish juices in, so it doesn't dry out that easily. Maybe flip a second time
after 4 or 5 minutes, and maybe 2 more minutes on the original side and
you're done.

	Serve with Lemon or Lime quarters, and the vegies you started
first.

	Bon apetite!
	Bill
