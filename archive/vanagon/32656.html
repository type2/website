&gt; &gt; electric heater that is considerably more efficient and safe.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure it is, but you're lucky if it puts out 100 BTU.  There is no way you
&gt; can get any serious heat for a car from the typical 12V automotive
&gt; source (i.e. batteries and alternator).  If there was, they probably
&gt; wouldn't have come up with gas heaters in the first place.  :-)

Granted, I use an electric in my Thing and have been comfortable enough 
in the past.  I am, however, usually unaffected by cold.  I enjoy the 
electric much more than having the gas heater shoot a steady stream of 
plasma into my crotch (when it decided it wanted to work) and worrying 
that it might explode at any minute.  I have talked to others at shows 
who are satisfied with the performance of their gas heater, I do not 
share those views.
