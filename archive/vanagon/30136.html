Subject: 15% off


Yesterday's mail brought an ad for Rocky Mountain Motor Works, in Woodland
Park, CO.  You may recognize this name, as they operate several businesses,
the one mentioned above having to do with VW bugs.  They also own the BusStop
and businesses having to do with Ghias, rabbits, etc.  

At any rate, they seem to be having some sort of &quot;last chance&quot; 15% off of
1995 catalog prices, so it may be that their bus-stop cat. will be offering
that, too.  The card says to mention code &quot;P5&quot; before your order, and to
use their toll-free number:  1.800.258.1996.

Might be worth a try if anyone's interested in doing some late year shopping.
