&gt;Sears Trailhandler      195/75R14       6/C/50          Horrid 

Hey I like these tires, they do have a coarse tread pattern, not as smooth 
as the Continentals, but they handle fine on my bus, 2 on the back, 1 Conti/ 
1 Uniroyal on front, all LT tires. No squirming about, but the '85 vanagon 
will slide if pushed hard, we had a 'handling' discussion a while back re 
different years/models, so it's not just the tire to consider. another tire 
choice...

Uniroyal Laredo         195/75/R14      6/C/50          open tread all season
                                                        OK (lowish) noise
                                                        Handling ??, only 1
                                                        mounted, doesn't wallow
