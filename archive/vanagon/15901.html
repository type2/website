&gt;Jim,
&gt;
&gt;I don't have any info offhand, but I would start with a Hot VW's mag or a VW
&gt;Trends Mag, I'm sure there's a source, such as Fast Freddy or CB
&gt;Performance, that can get them.  It's true the shaft bushings wear, maybe
&gt;try it yourself?  Knock out the bush, install something from a metal supply
&gt;house and drill &amp; ream to fit?
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Eugene
&gt;

The two sources suggested are the one's I tried already. Point taken,  Thanks
