Mitch: My question to you is &quot;Did you remove the air-vanes that the thermostat 
controls?&quot;. If you did, find some old ones and get them in there! They are 
necessary! I have wired those things wide open with no apparent bad effects, but
on an engine that I built (my first one-at 15 years old!) I took the advice of 
the mechanic that told me to scrap all that stuff. Engine lasted 26,000 and died
due to chronic overheating. Always detonated like crazy on the highway. I 
learned.
