Subject:      radio codes

 SyncroBeast           radio codes
All of the radio's of this sort that I have had, 2, had a default code from
the factory of .....1432.  Sound sort of familiar, air cooled guy's? ;)  Yep,
it's the firing order for a type 1 beetle motor.

As to the new radio's.  West Side people told me that the default code from
the factory is coded in the numbers found on the white paper sticker under the
trunk carpet.  I saw it, I think it was in the upper right corner, but I was
not able to verify this.  Anyone have any input to this?
