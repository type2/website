Subject: Re: hot solenoid not kicking

I don't like being under the bus when it is running, either. My ignition
system had steadily deteriorated to the point at which I was flipping a
coin when I turned the ignition key (heads, it starts, tails, it doesn't).
This weekend I did the old &quot;replace the starter solenoid with a ford truck
solenoid&quot; trick outlined in Muir, and eloquently reiterated last week by
someone on the list (you know who you are). I mounted it behind (back is
back) the voltage regulator, made some solderless connections with #12
wire, and, one hour later.... no more starting problems! Well, it's only
been one day, but I was happy that I was able to fix it. Total cost
(solenoid + wire + connectors)= $15.00. In retrospect, it seems obvious
that a three-foot wire to the starter would work better than a 20-foot wire
of the same gauge, and that a cool solenoid would work better than a hot
one, but hindsight is 20/20.

&gt;&gt;Otherwise, if I'm not on a hill, I get underneath with my
&gt;&gt;trusting 14g wire with alligator clips on each end and
&gt;&gt;attach one end to the pull-off connector on the solenoid
&gt;&gt;(red wire goes to it), and touch the other end to the HOT
&gt;&gt;terminal from batter to starter- it should try to kick over.
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure this goes without saying, but look: this kinda stuff scares me.
&gt;I'm completely paranoid about having trucks drop on me (I don't even trust
&gt;jackstands, I put bricks under the frame after I get the jackstands
&gt;situated) and yet twice this year I've had the truck fall off a jack.
&gt;Thought the parking brake would hold it, it didn't, etc.
&gt;
&gt;When you jump the starter like this, your chest (or your head) is under a
&gt;drive wheel. Right? All you have to do is leave it in gear once, and you
&gt;become a casualty in a Roadrunner cartoon. If you won't fix the starter
&gt;right, at least squirm up from the rear to hot-wire it so you're not under
&gt;the wheel.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;sermon over. please help yourself to cookies and hawiian punch in the lobby.&gt;
