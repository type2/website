Subject: Re: Let's make this large list EASIER !

Glad I generated some respose.........
&gt;.well all that's nice and good but why don't you set it in digest
&gt;mode...if you can't handle 100+ messages...or get a better commercial
&gt;carrier?

&gt;jonathan :-)

OK, being relatively new, how does digest mode work- I thoght it just holds
the messages until you get to download a whole bunch?  Or does it remove
the &quot;tail ID stuff?&quot;  The doublereed (oboe-bassoon) list gives about 20
mss. a day, 1200 members- this list gives over 60-80, ands has 600 members-
very active!  It's not the on line time that bothers me (the mail manager
is very fast and downloads it all (even 200 messages come in in 15 min.)-
it's the wading thru and reading/choosing what is worth keeping or replying
to.  People who'd been on since beginning like to chat, which is ok, as
long as subject is clearly scannable even to naked eye....Granted my
suggestions look cumbersome, but it's just a starting point to make subject
heading more clear before one &quot;clicks&quot; on the message or tags it for
deletion,,,,,Some very good mechanics I know won't bother with this because
of its size, so I was just thinking of ways to make the HELP stuff stand
out better- like if you are a reply (suggestion) don't repeat the query
line, include RE before subject, please!  Thanks....MB in NJ
