Jim, it sounds to me that you have hot spots in your system caused by air
bubbles, sometimes you need to bleed the system for quite a long time
before all the air is out, especially one with a loop so long. If air is
trapped by the thermostat that could explain why it is operating
intermittently.....DC --
