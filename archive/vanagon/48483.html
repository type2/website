&gt; Hi Everyone.  I was catching up on my reading over the weekend, and 
&gt; came across this little piece in the July 22/96 editon of AutoWeek.
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Let's go the the scoreboard:
&gt; Percent of consumers who &quot;believe&quot; they have ABS on their 1991 
&gt; model-year vehicles -- but do NOT
&gt; 
&gt; TRUCKS:
&gt; Volkswagen Vanagon 92%
&gt; 
&gt; So, anyone on this list filled out a survey lately??

Not me.  Pretty sad... I'd be suprised if the 92% new if their
engine was in the rear...  ;)
