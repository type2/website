Subject: Bay windsheild needed


As I was doing the seal replacement on my windsheild I managed to break
it. I found one close but they want $80, and I really can't afford that.
So if you have any leads on one, please let me know. Also, any listees
travelling to Springfield that would be willing to look for one let me
know and we'll discuss the details. Thank you
