Subject: RE: odd brick


&gt;Driving home, I noticed a '70s-era brick with what looked to be almost a=
&gt; radiator along the front -- I guessed it was some kind of ventilation 
unit,=
&gt; it looked very good, like it had come from the factory that way -- anyone=
&gt; have any guesses as to what it was..?


Whaddaya mean &quot;almost&quot; a radiator???
