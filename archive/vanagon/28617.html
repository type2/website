&gt; &gt; The book I have, &quot;VW Transporter 1949-1967&quot; says they stopped using
&gt; &gt; them on the Euro busses in '62, which would mean that Euro busses
&gt; &gt; never had nipples... nipple lights.

&gt; 	My '62 RHD bus has the large oval rear lights and 'nipple' or 
&gt; 	bullet indicatiors as well, i understand that my bus is very 
&gt; 	early 1962 but i thought in this country they stopped using 
&gt; 	semiphores in 1960-61.

The nipple statement was kind of a ledge I went on on my own, not from
the book.  Several people have emailed me privately to suggest I might be
wrong.  Sorry about that.  But at least I got to use the nipple word!

So if liking the nipple lights means you were weaned too early, what does
liking semaphores indicate?  Hmmmmmm.  Do semaphores say &quot;Schwing!!!&quot; when
they kick up?
