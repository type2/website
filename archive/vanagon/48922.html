&gt;longer?  I checked and the only permanent drain on the battert is that 
&gt;LCD clock behind the steering wheel.  I figure that cant be sucking back 
&gt;much &quot;jusic&quot; or can it?   Should I just go get another battery &gt;  A

I had something very similar to your story happen to the Dub at about
100K miles. Replaced the battery and the new battery exhibited the
same behavior as the old one. Noticed that I could turn my heater fan
motor up and it would work - even if the keys were out. Got to looking
at wiring diagrams and discovered that there was a relay that is
supposed to disconnect the fan from current if the ignition is off.
Chased the relay down, and surprise - the contacts were burned shut.
That little motor sat there and slowly ticked over even turned down as
low as it would go. Caused the Dub to run her battery down about every
three to four days. Got a new relay and never had the problem again.
