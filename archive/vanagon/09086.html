Subject: cops and busses



&gt;   I haven't had a bus since '71 but I got stopped a few times in those days.


Hmmm.... memories of times past comes back.....
This reminds of the time I got stopped for speeding in my '82 diesel Westy...

Just kidding, folks....  I wanted to wait till April 1st to send this one out,
but couldn't hold it back any longer.... My wife and I have joked each other
much about getting stopped for speeding in the '82 diesel Westy...  It would
have been a great embarassment or achievement, depending on your point
of view, but never happened so far....

Wishing everybody a happy new year,
