&gt; I got to step in here on the oil cooling bit....the oil cooler was
&gt; put in to make the engine run cooler...it seems that the early
&gt; prototype 4 cylinder VW engines did not have an oil cooler and
&gt; relied solely on aircooling. Unfortunately, they had a life of
&gt; 10k miles or so. The oil cooler was added and engine life went
&gt; up VERY significantly. From what I recall, the oil performs
&gt; approx. 40% of the cooling on a VW engine.

All right, who put the damn double Re in the subject line anyway? ;)

Ric,

The older engines may have broken down more without the oil cooler,
but wouldn't that be due more to the oil breaking down because it
(the oil) wasn't being kept cool?  This seems much more likely than
a slightly cooler oil in a thin coat removing enough heat to cool
the engine compared to the amount of cooling air doing the job.
