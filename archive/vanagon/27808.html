&gt; More information about the splash pan phenomena is needed and welcome.

I guess I've thought of these as 'belly' pans.  Often they were 
discarded.  They're good to have as they help protect the master cylinder 
and cables etc. from exposure to the weather.  It also helps keep 
excessive drafts from finding their way into the cab.  It also helps to 
have the little square rubber biscuits for the clutch &amp; brake pedal and 
also the booty for the accelerator rod to keep out the drafts.  8-)
