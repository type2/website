Subject: Re: VW Customer Relations &amp; reality check

Hi,

&gt; Do they know what they are talking about? Do they really mean that
&gt; Winnebago is converting EV's or is there a 'transporter' out there?

 ??? and the difference would be....?
 VW has always called the type II a &quot;transporter&quot; &quot;Eurovan&quot; and
&quot;Vanagon&quot; are just catchy names they used to market them in the US.

  I have to say that I think VW are probably right in thinking that
there isn't enough demand for Westies in the USA to justify bringing
them in. The USA is a strange market, what with all the wierd federal
regulations and stuff, and VW's German production plants are pretty
badly placed to compete in the fierce automotive marketplace in the US
as they are relatively inefficient. The world has changed since VW's
glory days in the sixties and they havn't kept up with what's happening
in the USA. This is their loss as a company and ours, as customers.
 They still do OK in Europe, which is the market they design for: time
to emigrate...?

Cheers,
	W.
