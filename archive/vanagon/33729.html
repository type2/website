That kinda says it for me. It's independence: the ability to establish a 
base of knowledge from which you can diagnose and repair problems on your 
own vehicle...or at least develop enough knowledge to prevent becoming a 
victim. Older VWs, especially pre-72 are relatively simple. Even a 
mechanical idiot like me can learn enough to repair most components. They 
are modular; &quot;systems&quot; if you will. If I can't learn how to repair a 
transmission, I can at least buy one for $400-$600 and install it myself. 

Don't buy an older bus unless you're willing to invest the time to learn 
about it. Don't buy an older bus unless you can spend some time with it, 
learning what makes it tick...and what makes it stop ticking. 90% of what 
will keep your bus from breaking is knowing what it expects from you. The 
other 10% is actually delivering. 

Newer buses? I don't know. '71 is as far as I've gotten.

My opinion. 8) Joe
