Subject: Vanagon heater cable replacement
Date: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 12:28:39 -0500

Hey all,
I've got the cables to my heater flapper boxes working sorta well but they
don't like it when I move the lever only because I've got them rigged up
because the adjustment bolts/hardware (not sure what exactly goes there) is
missing.  

In the spring I plan on replacing the cables so let me ask a couple
questions:  

Do new cables come with the adjustment hardware that attaches to the heater
flappers?

How hard a job is it, i.e. where to the two cables merge into the single
one that goes to the lever in the dash?  I assume that I will be able to
just replace the two cables while leaving the single cable alone, is this
true?  Do I have to drop the gas tank or anything similarly hideous?

How much do new cables cost?  Anyone know of a source for them besides the
dealer?

Thanks everyone,
Sean
