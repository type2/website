Got my new tires at a first rate tire shop ($267 installed ) and they had a
very cool gizmo, a spin balancer.  Electric motor and wheel that they can put
under a tire (while it's on a lift) and generate about 50mph of spin.  Very
effective at finding bad tire balance or bearings.

If you haven't solved the problem, might give it a try.

(They found a bad front left bearing for me)
