Subject: Re: height question

I am currently looking to move closer to my work. In Phoenix it's almost
impossible to find a house with a garage. Finding one tall enough for two
Westies is totally nuts! I am having a tough time just finding a double
carport. At work, the parking garage claims a 6'8&quot; clearance at one entrance
and 7'0&quot; at the other. I have *roughly* measured the '83 Westy to be near
7'. The '67 should be slighty shorter. Sorry folks I'll park out side!!

&gt;&gt;  I know mine doesn't fit in my garage, which is 7.5ft.  The door over 
&gt;&gt; hang is a few inches low.
&gt;
&gt;My 72 Westy fits into my garage with one inch to spare.  Of course, the
&gt;Safare bubble top won't fit into any garage.  That's its main drawback.  :(
