Subject:      Removing Waves in Westy Molding

As others have said, the cure to removing the waves from the plastic
molding in the Wesfalia cabinetry is heat:
~^~~^~~  remove the molding (be careful not to damage the groove in the
wood edge),
~~~~~~~ submerge it in hot water (must be boiling hot)
                 or use a hot air gun (care that the plastic isn't
damaged),
----------- stretch and let  cool or better yet submerge in cold water
while holding it stretched.
________ when reinstalling, the hot air gun (applied lightly) helps in
shaping tight turns.

And it improves gas mileage by 1.6% :-)
