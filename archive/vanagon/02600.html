&gt; &gt;Ordered 2 of these yesterday _at_ $93.95 US mounted and balanced. According
&gt; &gt;to the local dealer, they are sold on an emergency restriction basis. The
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A piece or for the pair. I paid 61.00 apiece for them about 3 months ago
&gt; from NTW and they are readily available
&gt;

Where do you guys live?  Around San Francisco, few places seem to
carry them, and the few that do want about $100 a tire.  Tire Rack
is asking $85 plus shipping (when I called a few weeks back).
