	Alistair wonders whether the drivers of VW busses
account for their lower fatality rate.

	I've always felt that the loose nut behind the wheel
was the most important safety component. For example,
VW Jettas are simply Golfs with trunks. But they appeal to
a group of buyers who tend to be some combination of
older, female, married, chauffering children, etc., compared
to Golf drivers.
	No surprise to me that the fatality rate per 100,000
cars for Jettas is 1/2 that of Golfs. Can it really be the
trunk sheet-metal absorbing rear-end collisions? I don't
think so. The drivers are different.

	I think the Ford Thunderbird, marketed primarily to men,
and the Mercury Cougar, marketed more to women, would show the
same difference is fatalities- single car accidents involving
drunk 21 year old women are rarer than for similar men. Not to
be sexist about this or anything, but if you look at the
population, you can't escape noticing it.

	Re Transporters/Busses/Vanagons/Eurovans, I think you're
generally safer because you're above most likely colliders. Only
a big 4X4 is as tall, so the impact has more sheet-metal to
spread out over. Except head-on into a wall, a bus isn't
going to get crumpled-up into a ball. Sitting at the front
in the driver's seat, you occupy less of the length of the vehicle
than if you're at the wheel of a conventional car, because of the
seating posture, so you're less of a target from the side too.

	But in a straight head-one collision with a drunk in a 
3000 lb american rust-bucket, well, its not like a Mercedes or
a Volvo. So keep your eyes open, friends!

	Bill
