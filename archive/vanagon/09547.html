First of all, volks, sorry for not letting youse all know that I 
wasn't able to make it to Pre-Tour West #1.  I didn't really decide
for sure until Friday when I finally lived up to the realization that
after being in Wisconsin for 10 days (no, I didn't drive back!), I
really had to get going on my work backlog.  BTW, in Antigo, WI (in
any other winter, part of the frozen tundra this time of year),
pop. ~8300, I saw a vanagon and an early 70's bus.  I was surprised.

As for the second go-around, a get-together in AZ the weekend of Mar.
24-26 would be perfect for me, since one way or another, I will be in
Tempe for the Pac-10 Women's gymnastics championships.  It would 
probably be quite a haul from Palo Alto, but if there's gonna be 
bus phreaks there, it might be worth it.

I know this is unlikely given the weight that the rest of the California
crowd has in the decision, but that's my two cents worth.

The weekend before that would be better for me if it's somewhere
closer, but I don't know if I'll be free.  I might get to go to Texas
for the Women's swimming championships.  That's a big &quot;might,&quot; since it
depends on the Stanford yearbook coming up with the money to send me there...
