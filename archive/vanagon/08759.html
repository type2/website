&gt; &gt; Jim, it sounds to me that you have hot spots in your system caused by air
&gt; &gt; bubbles, sometimes you need to bleed the system for quite a long time
&gt; &gt; before all the air is out, especially one with a loop so long. If air is
&gt; &gt; trapped by the thermostat that could explain why it is operating
&gt; &gt; intermittently.....DC -- 
&gt; 
&gt; I like this suggestion--when you bled the system before,did you raise the 
&gt; front wheel off the ground 15&quot; (40cm)?  That has to happen, or you will 
&gt; never get all the air out of the cooling system.

I'm going to third this motion.  As Joel said, I just went through all of
this including replacing the thermostat twice, and after two months of
scratching my head, I finally removed my underseat heater which was
leaking VERY small amounts of coolant.  Turned out that that VERY small
amount was enough to put air in the system and make the temperature behave
weirdly.  Think of ANY place that air can get in the system and isolate it
BEFORE going to through the hassle of thermostat replacement. Also, the
bleeding procedure is deceptive.  Except when I flushed the system, I
NEVER had air at the front of the car.  After I removed the underseat
heater, the problem didn't clear up until I had driving for a while
revving the car on a couple of particularily steep hills.  The engine part
seems to bleed itself IF you have a sealed system the air heads out
through the expansion tank as it draws coolant in from the refill tank. 
But to properly bleed it, you REALLY have to get the front end WAY high 
so the bubbles all head up front.

By the way, I was not able to find a NON-VW thermostat that really looked 
exactly like the VW one.  What was in the car (and appeared to be working 
ok all last spring and last summer) didn't look exactly like the VW one, 
so I'm not sure why it was put in.  I bought one from NAPA that was the 
same as the one that was in there, but it wasn't listed as such.  I had 
to go through all the boxes to find it.

Gotta go!
