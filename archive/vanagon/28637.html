OK,

Now I'm sadly sure even now that this is primarily going to end up a
west coast thing, so before that happens, since the likelihood
of us east coasters having enough time to get out there, then
blow 3 weeks then get back is for most of us totally impossible,
I feel we need an alternative, and less we fail to get on the
ball I think we should start planning alternatives now.

Personally I see 2 good alternatives.

1. We make a top O the world east coast alternative up into
the Great White North on this side of the continent, don't
we have some Canadians up on this side to help organize?

or

2. We make a 2 week transcontinental US run out to Vancouver then
come on back, sort of a GNATT revisited for everyone who
didn't or couldn't (like me) get to it last time.  Plus we could
also pick up people from the interior who are going on the
trip as well and give them company on the way out.

Frankly I was tickled that my new job gives me a whopping 2
weeks vacation, we are not all self employed, or educators,
or just generally able to spare the 1 full month this would take
for us on this coast, and flying out and renting a vehicle just
doesn't feel good to me,  if I'm blowing my entire vacation in
a Bus it will damn well be my Bus, all $400 of it.

If we can get some good interest going on this now, I'm willing
to definitely help organize this time.  Hell maybe we would even
have a better chance of that Joel character going along, then he
could be kidnapped for the main trip.

My thoughts, not intended to take anything from the well
planned trip, I simply don't want to miss out again as circumstances
forced me to last year and I feel a lot of other east coasters will
be scared away by the time commitment as well.
