&gt;used auto-body seam sealer and closed the gap.  I don't know why I have this
&gt;gap, my '67 didn't; does anyone else have it?  BTW - The easiest

&gt;box of the system.  While I was in there, I painted everything real nice like.

Yeah, The Bozobus has this &quot;fresh-air-always&quot; system - there is no seal at
all on either side of the main box (not even close).  I was thinking of
using some of that expanding-foam stuff in there, but was originally
worried about the fumes if that stuff is burnt (something like either
phosgene or hydrochloric acid fumes).  Now, in a more lucid moment, it
occurs to me that if the fire has reached the front vent box, I have other
things to worry about other than fumes...

In the winter, I've been duct-taping over the entire screen area on the
outside to keep the wind-chill on the inside to a minimum. (The rectangular
plate on the air box has been off for quite a few years now. I think I
meant to replace the seal around the inlet/flap/door/thing).  I know I
bought a new rubber seal for it, but chickened out on the installation
because I'm allergic to rivets.)
