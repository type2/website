Subject: Eureka Springs, AR Camping &quot;Event&quot; Details

NWAVWA VW Show &amp; Swap, Eureka Springs, Arkansas

August 23-25.  Pool party and stuff on Friday night, show on Saturday, 
tour on Sunday (I think).  Call Michael at (501) 253-3350 (8 pm Fri - 7 
am Mon.) for more info.  

Now for the non-NWAVWA related info:

The LiMBO quickie Bus Camping Event will be at Beaver Park Campground 
(owned by the town of Beaver).  Rates are $6 for primitive, $10 for 
water hook up, $12 for water/electric.  First night's fee to reserve a 
spot.  Located 6 miles north of Eureka Springs on Hwy. 187, over the 
suspension bridge and down to the river/lake.  This is supposed to be a 
beautiful location, but lacks shower facilities.  You can use your 
receipt to get into the showers at the Beaver Lake Campground 8 miles up 
the road.  Call the City of Beaver for reservations (ASAP) at 501-253-5700.

Call Lance Moeller if you have questions (417-889-8813) or e-mail me.

See you at Busses by the Beaver!  (My wife already hates that name)  ;-)
