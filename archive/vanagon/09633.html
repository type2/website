&gt; Ok, here's the list I have of people in AZ:
&gt; 
&gt; (we might want to take this discussion out of the vanagon list
&gt;  once we know that all the AZ and/or NM people are listening.)
&gt; 
&gt; Dyer Lytle (Tucson) (me!)
&gt; lytle_at_noao_dot_edu
&gt; 
&gt; Todd R. Schroeder (Phoenix)
&gt; todds_at_sunnet.chotel_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Dave Phillips (Tucson)
&gt; phillips_at_aries.tucson.saic_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Dave Black (Sedona)
&gt; dblack_at_argus.lowell_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Seems like there was someone else over at UMC who was asking
&gt; me about carburation problems recently, can't find the mail file
&gt; tho....

There were two of us over at the U of A Radiology, but I have been 
laid off and lost my e-mail at that address. The two you are missing 
are:

Tim White
bonehead_at_gonzo.radiology.arizona_dot_edu

and myself, 

Richard Lamoreaux
lumpy_at_rtd_dot_com
'87 Weekender
'78 chicken coop.
