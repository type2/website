Chris;
I have pondered your dilemma since you posted it . My truck had about
four years or brake dust accumulated on the (steel) wheels. I went
through a box of Brillo pads and A LOT of elbow grease to get them
clean. I have always cleaned them like this until I replaced the pads.
The new ones evidently are made different. Unfortunately ,five years
later,  rust is starting to peak out where I wore the paint thin. I do
not know how your clear coat would hold up either. If you find a GOOD
solution let me know.

&gt;Hey all,  Need some advice on removing STUBBORN brake dust from alloy

&gt;Don't even bother suggesting stuff like &quot;Armor All wheel cleaner&quot; and 
&gt;the like.
&gt;Lemme just say I have even tried mineral spirits and a stiff bristle 
&gt;brush to no
&gt;avail. The damn stuff is on there like paint! 
&gt;
&gt;Anybody got any solutions of a solution that'll take this crap off 
&gt;without
&gt;eating up the clearcoat?
