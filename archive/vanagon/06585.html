HEY!!! How about splitting up the Washingtonians?
There's a much more major difference between W. WA (rain forests,etc.)
and E. WA (Desert, mostly, IMHO.) :^)

Eric Oster (ekoman_at_u.washington_dot_edu) could not think of anything
for this week...I own two busses, both mostly broken, one drivable.:)
