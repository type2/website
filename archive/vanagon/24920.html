So Scott Beckstead says:
&gt; I'm 6'2 as well and I really love the bay window I have.  In fact I 
&gt; almost wiped out driving my wife's Taurus the otherday because the mirror 
&gt; had gotten in the way and I am used to seeing nearly everything in front 
&gt; of me with out looking around obstacles. Splitties are still &quot;Way Cool&quot;.  My 
&gt; wife wants to get a split window westy now!  
&gt; 

I love my bay window too.  But I would love to have a '50's single or crew
cab.  Those are soooo cool, as Mr. Kenyon well knows. ;)

BTW, last weekend I got a double wave from a couple in a nice white EV 
Multivan passing me on Hwy 50.  We both were mutually admiring each others 
beasties.  Actually, I'm getting fewer waves from the split window owners.
Especially the younger crowd.  I guess they think they're way too cool
for us, ahem, older folks. (God, that hurts) :(
