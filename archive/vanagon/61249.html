HELP
	OK so we now have changed the temp sender in the thermostat on big 
sister (Elizabeth)'s 84 westie. Still the little red light is a 
flashing. That is untill we disconect the sender and off goes the 
light. Oh sure it takes a lot longer for the temp guage to make it's 
climb but the result is the same. While triing to locate the temp 
guage control unit(suggested by Dan Fuller Thx) sis noticed the large 
greem lake coming from the refill tank (poor girl her hair is starting 
to come out in handfulls).As stated before we have bled Betty way to 
many times to be funny anymore and I am afraid that sis may soon bail 
on repair and just start to groove on that funky little light.
	If anyone has any other ideas we would like to try them soon.(I mean 
SOON) Elizabeth has been at my house for a week and my wife is on the 
edge.

TIA
