Subject:      Re: Distributor Cap

Actually, it is a bad design in that normal dust and dirt cause premature
failure.  It has been updated on later cars to a conductive plastic cap.  The
later cap can be retrofitted to any Vanagon.  Make sure the cap you buy is
compatible with your existing wires or upgrade at the same time.  The caps use
either the normal sleeve or a pin.
