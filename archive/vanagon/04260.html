&gt; CRRRRAAASSHHHHttinkleeeeeeee
&gt; 
&gt; Up outa bed, yank back the curtains. The neigbhours white Vanagon
&gt; has been hit by a car, pushing it forward about five feet, into
&gt; the parked car in front of it. The right rear has been pushed right
&gt; in and the whole of the back is abit mushed. There is a new Fiesta
&gt; XR2 thing on the other side of the road, very badly damaged, but
&gt; the driver has done a runner. Ahh, a joyrider. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've tracked down a second hand screen for my bus, but my worry
&gt; is that this guy is going to do it again. As to the Vanagon, I don't
&gt; know whether it will survive, but one thing for sure; if you
&gt; own a bus don't bring it to Coventry, cause the locals will have
&gt; ago.

the way.
