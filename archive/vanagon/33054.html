Subject: Wanted:Syncro Westfalia

I just subscribed to this list and want to buy a Syncro Westfalia.  I am more
than willing to pick it up anywhere in the US and drive back to California, a
good excuse to break it in.

If you see something in your local paper or area please let me know.  

Has anybody driven one with chains?  I go boarding alot and do not want to
hassle with them.

Thanks,

Craig
