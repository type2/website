Subject: RE Portable CB

I was a &quot;Best&quot; yesterday.
1)  The counter person said they are closing out all their CB radios
2)  There were:
     a)  a GE &quot;emergency&quot; unit kit w/ magnetic mount antenna 40 channels 4
watts for $38
     b)  a GE portable hand held unit with equivalent features to a) above
also for $38
     c)  at least one dash mount unit, also a GE for about $38
     d)  a couple of other models by &quot;Cobra&quot; for $50-100.
