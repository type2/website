So Alistair Bell says:
&gt; 
&gt; I once had, but let slip away...
&gt; 
&gt; 				the manual for the fridge.
&gt; 
&gt; Its quite slim, so if anyone has it let
&gt; me know, I would love to get a copy again.
&gt;

&gt; 

I've got a copy, at least the Dometic one.  I'll have to
dig it up.  Let me know how ya want it.  FAX or snail
mail.
