&gt; I have one question;  is the dash fan used only for the side vents?
&gt; My Westy also sends out heated air at all times, but I attributed it to

Walt, by now you have heard multiple answers to your question. Since I
just got through renovating my 82 westy, here is what was found: 

1) top lever on dashboard controls: far to the right will send air to the four
vents on the horizontal part of the dash; but most will flow through the two
main vents at the front: why? because these are also hooked up to the
external air
flow control; in the middle - a combination of foot and dash air; far to
the left - air will also flow out the foot well in the cabin area. Now to
make it really confusing: this footwell vent and the two smaller dash
vents/defrosters accept only hot air (unlike the lager middle dash vents).

2) second lever from the top - heat control - far to the right max heat, far
to the left no heat;

3) third lever from the top - fresh air control - far to the right no fresh
air and maximum heat out all of the aforementioned vents; far to the left-
a mix of
warm/cool air out the centre dash vents and hot air out the footwell and side
defrosters (if you have your heat fully to the right);

4) fourth from the top - far to the left fresh air to the passengers out two
top vents; far to the right no fresh air to the passengers.

Now the two side vents on the vertical part of the dash provide only fresh air
which can be increased by the fan. These provide no heat.

All of the above assume you are moving at a reasonable speed. 

The fan (your original question) is inefficient for pumping hot air - and
works best when the fresh air lever is partially or fully open (which
means less heat). If you
want maximum heat at standstill out the footwell and side defrosters it
will be necessary to install a fan directly inline with hot air pipe from
the back. The alternator fan simply cannot push the hot air to the front
at low speeds, and the built in fan is not designed to do so. Early 80
models did not have the fresh air fan system and were simpler in design.

As for the vents in the door - they probably increase/decrease pressure
and improve circulation but do not vent hot air.

If  you aren't getting these kinds of connections adjustment can be
easily done at the dash (save heat) by removing the plastic vent cover in
the centre of the console and by removing the dash control facia. DC


PS I did install an inline fan and now have pretty good heat out the side
vents at a standstill. The other item when really cold is to block the
fresh air intake at the front.....and put insulation in strategic places.
