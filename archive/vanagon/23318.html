&gt; Hello All,
&gt;   Anyone know if the front bumper on the EV's can support the stress of a

&gt; put on and the adapter to put a winch on the hitch. Anyone with know how
&gt; in this area, suggestions are welcomed.

Yes I think a 4,000 lb. pull winch should be just about right for 
yanking the front bumper right off.


Seriously I doubt a 'bumper' could handle 2 tons on almost any vehicle.  
I think you'll need to somehow 'mount' the winch to put the stress on the 
frame.  I haven't looked into a winch fro the front of my EV.  But I did 
just put a hitch on the back that was rated to tow 3500 lbs.  I'd have to 
crawl under the van to see what a front mount could look like.  The rear 
hitch mounted using six holes already in the frame.  4 replaced shorter 
with longer bolts that also hold the bumper on and two are new 
additions.  Adding one of the new bolts is a challenge since the nut is 
behind a heat shield for the muffler.

The 3500 lb. hitch mount should handle most of what the 4000 lb. winch could.

I'm real curious about what you intend to do with an EV that requires a 2 
ton winch?  Running an EV through mud?  pulling out tree stumps?
