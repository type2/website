Tim, 

I have to change the outer left front boot on my syncro real soon. 

an you advise us as to whether to try to go for the special CV boots that
you have. Did you choose these? Is there an advantage to these over whatever
it is you would get from VW? 

Yes, the job looks like a pisser as you have to take the wheel off the upper
control arm to shift it out of the way. I will let you guys know what ever
it is I go through to do this on my own.

Derek
