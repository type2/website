&gt; A guy at the FLAPS has a set of pistons he says are for a 1700 - they are

&gt; 
&gt; What cc would this engine be with the stock crank?  He says that the stock 
&gt; 1700 is a 90mm piston.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone ever use these?  The bottom end should be strong enough since the rod 
&gt; journals are reduced for the 2000 engine.  Are these a good thing?

I don't think so.  It's true that they will fit right in and give you
1900 cc's, but you should see how thin the cylinder walls are.  I had
them in my bus when I got it, and guess what?  One of the pistons was
burnt.  I don't think they are a good idea.  I got the 1800cc set
instead (93mm) which was also a bolt in, and 30K hard miles later it is
still running strong as the day I put it together.  The thin walls on
the 1900 kit will keep the engine from cooling as well, and make it less
reliable.  If you want more displacement, get the 94mm (2 liter) pistons
and barrels and swap your crank and rods for 2 liter parts.  All IMO, of
course.
