&gt; &quot;GRADUATED TO THAT STAGE&quot;??????  Chris my friend, I unfortunately
&gt; graduated to that stage 19 years ago when I first pulled the engine out of
&gt; Bus sitting along side Interstate 5 somewhere... 
...SNIP 		  

YIPE!!  Most humble apologies from foolish grasshopper who has also... 
 BEEN THERE...on I-70.  

&gt; like to do it?  No.  I hate it.  I hate having gas sprayed in my face when
YIPE!!!  DONE THAT...

&gt;    I hate watching one of the engine studs snap off on a Sunday
&gt; morning and knowing that the nearest parts shop won't be open until 
YIPE!! CRIED OVER IT...         
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, it is easier than trying to change the oil cooler
&gt; gaskets with the engine still in the Bus
    NEVER BEEN THERE  ;) 

&gt; Geos or Datsuns?  Because I secretly love to work on my Bus and it is
&gt; the coolest form of transportation known.  OK, I know, I'm one sick puppy.
&gt; 

YEP!!  I'm right there, man...   especially like the part where it's 30
degrees, and the metal feels like  -0.  The flash light is getting dimmer,
... but you have to get the engine into the bus by daylight or you won't 	
BE going home for Christmas this year, but then you got the wrong oil pump in
there, and Christmas ends 12 miles later anyway...  			
SEEN IT  =:O&gt;-&lt;       	 
 
&gt; stripped nutted, German-Brazilian-Mexican machinery.  Think of me when all
&gt; of you are at the beach having a good time.
&gt; 
Again, as a fellow dirt diver, I beg your forgiveness for that awful 
assumption... I promise it will never happen again for a while.   

What are you people looking at ???  :)  

Chris,  '71 Camper/Bus/...      GOT IT...BAD!
