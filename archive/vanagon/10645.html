Well, I paid 1500 for my 78, which is mechanically good, but needs the usual
rust replacement panels. Front dogleg,rockers, and panel in front of rear
wheels. Parts locally altogether are 300 dollars, then the price of the 
body work. These machines are worth what you want to pay, they are quickly
becoming classics up here in Canada because of the rust. Most people
just part them out it seems, rather than restore them.I feel that if you
pay 2000 and really like it, then it is worth it. this is the third one
I've owned, and my favorite, because of the fuel injection, the doublebed
up top, and the swiveling front seat. I wish it was a deluxe with the
propane, but it ain't. Oh well, I bring along my Coleman, and I use lots
of ice. I don't mind. A word of warning however, if you do buy it, you
will find that you are hooked for life, and no junky ever had a habit as
expensive as a Van enthusiast with a Rocky Mountain Catalogue in front
 of them!!
Regards,
Let me know how it works out.
