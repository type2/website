Subject:      turbos? i gotcher turbos right here!

bill kennedy asked about turbo diesels ...

the german books i have about buses list several engine sizes for the
diesels and a couple of versions that are turbo-charged. somewhere i had
read/heard that a large percentage of the camper versions sold in europe
were turbo-diesels. since gasoline (benzine) costs so much more than the
diesel fuel, and turbo'd to get more power for cruising and climbing hills.
i don't think they would be any faster off the line, but would be able to
keep up the speed once they reached it. Turbo-turtles, you might say.
