&gt; i know where the lower anchor point is, but the upper part

Sorry I can't help you Norman.  I can sympathize, just a wee bit, though.
Mine broke, too, and fell on my foot one fine morning.  Was under warranty,
so I just complained and they fixed it.  But, of course, they caused about
a dozen more problems that needed attention later...
