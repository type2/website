Subject: Re: Fwd: Middle Seat for 87 Vanagon GL Westphalia Camper

&gt;  So, I assume it's a 1987 VanagonGL Westfalia camper. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Ok. I have spoken w another listmember w/ an '89 full GL westy and his
&gt; doesn't have the filler tracks in the floor either. 
&gt; 
&gt; But they did in '85 on the full GL westys. 
&gt; 
&gt; so somewhere between '85 and '87 the florr tracks were dropped (why, I don't
&gt; know - It seemed like a neat Idea to be able to pop out those filler plates
&gt; and slide in a seat, buy VW works in mysterious ways... (kind of like taking
&gt; away the glovebox on the first Jetta III's....)
&gt; 
My '88 Westy GL has the tracks. (Canadian model, although I doubt 
that makes a difference).
