Subject: Louvered Window Leaks

Greetings-

One of the louvered windows leaks in my '68 camper. The leak SEEMS to be
coming through a poor fit between the the lower louver and the tiny rubber
seal on the frame of the window. The window seal (the one that seals the
frame of the bus to the entire window) is the only part I can find in the
usual places; Bus Boys, West Coast Metric, Rocky Mountain MWK's, etc.

Does any one know where I could find the rubber stripping to repair the
window? Or is there a common place for these windows to leak that I have
overlooked, it is kinda hard to tell where the leak is coming from.

thanks,
Ken
