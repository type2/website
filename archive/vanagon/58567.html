Subject: Re: Cool Paint Ideas-camo paints

Ronny,
I was at the local paint shop supply store recently. While there I spied
that they sell the &quot;official&quot; camo paints by the quart and by the gallon. If
really interested I could get the specific names and manufacturers for you
as I get a chance.
Peace,
