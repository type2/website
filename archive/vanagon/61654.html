Subject: Re: 1.9 fuel injection / O2 problem

&gt;My 85 Westy is running very rich.  Symptoms are black smoke, poor gas
&gt;mileage and lack of power.
&gt;The following parts were checked by replacing with a known good part
&gt;fuel injectors (mine weep a little, but not serious)
&gt;coolant temperature sensor
&gt;ECU
&gt;Air Flow sensor
&gt;Oxygen Sensor
&gt;
&gt;The fuel pressure is OK (30lbs).
&gt;Fuel pressure regulator is OK.
&gt;Timing &amp; advance is OK.
&gt;cylinder pressure is relatively OK (125 psi on 1&amp;3, 150 on 2&amp;4).

&gt;&gt;Hi =

&gt;&gt;I had the same thing with my 85 westy turned out to be a bad wire going=
&gt;
&gt;&gt;from the o2 sensor to fuel injection computer. The wire is coax and was=

&gt;&gt;kinked by something in the harness, giving the computer the full lean
&gt;&gt;signal, so the computer responds with full rich.
&gt;&gt;good luck

&gt;&gt;

=46rom the O2 sensor to where it connects to the wire harness is a single=

wire (no coax).  From the connector to the ecu it is coax.  The shield is=

connected to pin 6, a wire from the air flow sensor.  I found the center
conductor of the coax is shorted (intermittently) to the shield.  Are you=

saying this is NOT OK?
Thanks
