Subject: RE:  Carpet availability

I know there was a post several weeks ago regarding seat uphosterey.  I 
wonder if any members have located a reliable source for carpet for 
Vanagons.  I know there are many companies that supply carpet for the 
busses, but I'm in need of a new carpet for an 84 Vanagon.  Thanks in 
advance for the leads.

Fred,

84 Vanagons
