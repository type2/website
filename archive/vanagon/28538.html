So thom fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  &gt;that a driving vehicle is worth something.  She also said that the appraisal
&gt; &gt;  &gt;company called around a couple dealers and that the going price for a mint
&gt; &gt;  &gt;one is $700, so mine must be worthless.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe you should tell them that you'll take a mint one, then.
&gt; 
&gt; Is that &quot;Franklin&quot; mint?  Double mint?
&gt; 
&gt; Thom
