Erik asks of Minnesotans:
&gt; Does anyone know of a cure  for these thermostats? Mine was broken when I bought
&gt; my '82 Westy. I replaced it and within 6 months I noticed that it was dead 
&gt; again. The failure is that the coppper bellows just stretch out permanently (no 
&gt; longer thermally activated). I guess its not a big deal in mild climates where I
&gt; am, but what do the eskimo-type folks do in Minnesota?

Buy Wasserboxers :)
