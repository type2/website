Subject: Update on Inuvik

I just spoke to someone at the Alaska Department of Tourism.  They told me
that though the Dalton Highway is open further north than it used to be, it
is still closed at the furthest northern point, so that a driver cannot
approach the Beaufort Sea.

Also, the idea of travelling to an oil field is not attractive to me :-(.

Northward Ho!
Ron
