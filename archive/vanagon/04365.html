For your info, Joel, and anyone else interested
in gas heaters:

Ark Mirvis, of Automotive Heater Technologies,
is at 31 Byram Bay Road, Hopatcong, NJ *07843*
(there was a typo on the ZIP code on the other
list). Phone is still 201-398-6363. 

He is in our neck of the woods (about 10 minutes
from us), so that wrong ZIP code stuck out like 
a sore thumb! Anthony has known him closely for
a few years and highly recommends his heaters.

Lori and Anthony Gelato
