Subject: Report on Mid-Atlantic Camp Out

We had nine buses show up, plus one wannabus. Three Syncro Westies, two 
Vanagon Westies, on Vangon GL, plus three breadload Westies. No 
splitties :-(. I must comment on the beautiful original breadload 
colors: a lime yellow/green, THE orange, and a deep sky blue. All in a 
row, they made the Vanagons look quite boring.

We were camping at Massanutten Mountain, in the Shenandoah Valley, 
north west VA. Weather was warm enough for plenty of swimming, nice cool 
evenings for sleeping. Seventeen adults with fourteen kids, nine and 
under! Kids rode bikes and played soccer in a meadow central to the 
camping sites. One family decided to stay an extra day, and they are up 
there right now, lucky folks.

Saturday noonish we took two syncros onto the Peters Run Trail, 
designated for 4WD vehhcles, but mostly used by motorcyles and the like. 
Before we went a ranger looked at the vans and told us we would not be 
able to finish the south end of the trail: to rough and rutted, and we 
would never make it over all the rocks. Of course we did, after stopping 
for a swim at a wonderful spring fed mountain pond along the way. Photos 
to follow.

Saturday night we had a potluck, and Sunday morning did a caravan down 
the &quot;hidden&quot; valley between the two ridges of the mountain: beautiful, 
unspoiled farmland. We finished up with a group photo op. 

All in all, a low key, relaxing weekend.
