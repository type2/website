1)  Thanks to Dave for the cool http site--I checked it out on Mosaic 
today.  Lotsa nice busses/vans out there.  Any room for my currently 
homely '70? :)

2)  I looked at the bumper sticker suggestions, and I'm wondering:  is 
anyone doing a tally of preferences?  I cheerfully volunteer to do so, if 
noone else has already.  BTW, I liked &quot;netsurfnugen&quot;.

3)  Also there is the &quot;Volkswagen AG&quot; home page.  VW features a few new 
models, but the text is all German.  Anyone want to translate (SStones, 
anyone??)?  

Last, but certainly not least...

4)  Thanks to Ric for posting the list of restoration manuals.  I have 
been looking without success for years for the &quot;VW Beetle and 
Transporter...&quot; restoration book, and thus finally ordered it.  Can't 
wait to get it!!
