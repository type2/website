Subject: Re: cheap fix to vanagon hesitation problem (harness fix)

&gt;from the mar-apr 95 issue of LiMBO:
&gt;
&gt;the first item to get ahold of is a Plus 10, 16-volt capacitor (Radio Shack/
&gt;Archer 10 MFD Tantalum Capacitor, 16 WVDC max.), 
&gt;value capacitor. 

&gt;VW latest suggestion is a 22MFD, Tantalum capacitor, 25VDC.

Wow, I wonder how Bob MacDonalds got a &quot;suggestion&quot; out of this from VW! Up
to now, it seems like VW gave no information on the auxiliary wiring harness
fix whatsoever. Now they appear to be handing out hints on how to reverse
engineer their own harness.
