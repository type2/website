Subject: new bodega news


I just talked to the ranger at the entrance kiosk of Bodeg Dunes
campground, asking him if he could help us in our quest to get adjacent
campsites.  Their official check-in time is 2pm, but he suggested
as many of our group arrive by noon as possible, and that they
would let us in early.  I realize that all of you will not be able
to do this, but if as many as possible do, it will help the cause.

If you have to arrive later, I again suggest giving your confirmation/
reservation number info to someone who is arriving early, so that
they can temporarily claim your spot (and return it to you)  :)
