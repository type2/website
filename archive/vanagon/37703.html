Subject: [T1] Removing front wheel cylinders
Date: Fri, 16 Jun 1995 03:05:48 +0000

Evening!

Since the rear brakes were in such sorry shape on the 67 Rusty I got bold
and took apart the driver's side drum.  Apparently a family of wasps made a
large nest in there at one time cuz it was full of dead bugs and paper and
crap.  Anyway, since I have it apart I planned on replacing the wheel
cylinders and such but -- how do you remove them from the backing plate?
Or, without going through that, should I just hone the old ones and rebuild
them?  They don't look too scored or anything but they did sit for 2-3 years
with little or no fluid in the system.

Wheel bearings:  Do I have to remove the inner bearings or can I just stuff
a bunch of grease in there?  The bearings don't look too bad but they list
for $7.50/ea from the Bus Stop so should I just buy new ones?  One more
question, can I use lithium grease or should I go find some moly grease...

Oh yeah, are the front shoes a different size than the rear shoes?  I bought
new shoes for the rear and compared them to the old front ones and the new
ones aren't as wide.  Should I take 'em back or what?

Later,

Bob J.
