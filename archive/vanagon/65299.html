Paul--

I just put a new radio in Vanagon. It's a Sony CDX-4160, which is an am/fm
single CD player. It has a removeable face for theft protection.

It's lists as 6 3/4&quot; deep. I bought it, mail order, from Nelson at
Crutchfield (800) 955-3000. Crutchfield lists the maximum depth of a radio
that will fit in the Vanagon as 6 1/4&quot; so I knew it would be a squeeze.

The space in the dash is limited, but by being careful to move the wires on
the back of the unit out of the way, so as not to squish them, the unit JUST
fit. I had to file out the corners of the original radio hole in the dash
slightly to accomodate the stereo.

I also removed part of the black metal bracket that holds the original radio
under the dash from behind. I took the pracket out and cut away the bottom
part with a hacksaw. The top of this bracket is used to hold a grill (looks
like a speaker grill) on top of the dash between the windshield and the ash
tray. So that top part of the bracket has to be saved and re-installed.

I'm still using the stock speakers, but the CDs sound great. It's great to
have good sound on long trips. I sort of spent more than I could afford on
this unit, but it's turned out to be well worth it. (Especially on my recent
6,000 mile trip out west.)

Let me know if you need any further info.
Good Luck
