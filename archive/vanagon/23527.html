Seems to me that if the gurus from VW thought they'd help, they'd be on the
vehicle. I'd worry more about making sure the thermostat works, that the
engine is clean, and that the fanbelt is good.

My '59 with a '65 1600 always passes the St. Muir engine overheating test
and I don't have any scoops.
