Subject: Oil Level

If you guys will remember my post about excess oil level about four months
ago I tested oil level vs. engine oil temp extensively and determined that
oil temp rises rapidly as you near the max mark on the dip stick and then
goes off the scale above the max mark.

Based on these tests I have determined that the engine doesn't like you to
fill the oil even to the max mark and I never fill it beyond half way between
the min. and max. mark.  Tests were conducted using a VDO oil temp gague I
installed.

To repeat the conclusion of these tests: never fill your oil to the max mark!


Sorry, it sounds radical and suspicious to say this, but there you go.
