&gt; &gt; ahhh what's the plural of you-all, anyway?

&gt; I was in Texas recently.  The plural is all you all.  Really.

In North Alabama, it's you's (sp?) all.  Some do not make a distinction
between the singular and plural.  When shopping, instead of the clerk
saying &quot;Have a nice day&quot; or something equally unfelt and untrue, the 
North Alabamians say &quot;You come back&quot;, &quot;You all come back&quot;, or &quot;You's all
come back&quot;.  There doesn't seem to be a relationship between the number
of shoppers and the response.

Don't know if things are different where Joel lives.  They're probably
all boning up on German for the Mercedes plant.  Does anyone know how to
say &quot;You all come back&quot; in German?
