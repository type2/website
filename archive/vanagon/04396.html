&gt; I've been coaxing my '81 brick's exhaust for about 10K miles now, but this
&gt; weekend a 1inch -square section of the crossover pipe blew out...the sides
&gt; of the pipe are just too corroded to hold in the gases! :-(    Anyway, I
&gt; called the dealer and found that they want $188 for the crossover pipe assembly
&gt; .. not sure how much things like the cat. converter will run.  My question
&gt; is -- are there any recommended aftermarket sources for VW exhaust systems?
&gt; I'd appreciate any leads.

For what its worth: the left side of our 82 exhaust manifold needed
replacing; VW wanted 400 for it. We found  a wreckers that would take the
part off intact and sell it for 75. My point is this: if the piece of
which you speak is cast iron then it is likely that a wrecker can get you one
cheap and it will be as good as new. If anything the Vanagon exhaust
system is pretty rugged so you shouldn't have trouble finding a used one.


Are you in CAL?
