Subject: Vanagon Stereo Upgrade Question

I want to replace my cassette/radio  with a dash mounted CD player.

Following Ajax' hints from a few weeks ago, I ordered a Crutchfield catalog
as basic reference material. After drooling for a while, I called the 800 number to find 
out what size reciever would fit in the Syncro Westie. The sales rep said I could 
not exceed 6 1/4 inches in depth. That pretty much excluded 95% of the head units
they had listed, including ALL the dash mounted CD players.

Who has been down this road before?  Is the 6 1/4&quot; restriction for real?

Thanks,

Tom F.
90 Syncro Westie
