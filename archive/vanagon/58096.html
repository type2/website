Hi All: In helping to perpetuate the EPA thread, I must defend the
thread as being on-topic. The thread started out as freon types and car
testing, both of which are instigated (questionably) by the EPA, and
both of which affect my cars directly. Examples were brought up by
knowledgable listees who have been affected by an overzelous EPA--those
were perhaps off point except to the fact of their absurdity.  These
examples should open everyone's eyes to the fact that some of the EPA's
ideas should be questioned.  Isn't it popular to say &quot;Question
Authority&quot;?

A point in fact and directly on subject:  Against my wishes, my 1965 bug
was retitled as a 1991 when I converted it to a dune buggy.  The vehicle
is street legal and there is no way I can pass emission standards set
for a 1991 vehicle.  We drove this buggy less than 200 miles per year,
mostly to local bug-ins, and since vehicle testing came to our city in
1993, it has been sitting in the garage.

At the present time Vancouver DOE is trying to decide how to eliminate
old lawn mowers, boat and motorcycle engines that are extremely dirty. 
Here they are asking people to voluntarily turn in their old machines
for newer, less poluting ones.  They especially like push mowers and
bicycles. (They started a rebate program here last summer for when you
turn your power mower in for a push or electric mower).  Noel,  where
will that leave your Guzzi?   See you at the scrap yard!
