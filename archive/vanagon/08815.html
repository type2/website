&gt; Its an interesting problem of personal freedom vs. the common good.
&gt; I think I am a pretty tolerant person, but when I see somebody driving
&gt; around with the seatbelt dangling uselessly I make a snap judgement as to
&gt; the mental capacity of said driver. Why don't more people wear seatbelts,
&gt; dip their high beams, align their lights, move into the right lane, signal
&gt; before turning (not just during the turn) etc.?
&gt; 

Simple.  Overpopulation.

When people do stupid things that put themselves or others in jeopardy,
it's becuase the victim of their stupid actions remain anonymous to 
the stupid.  The stupid might not cut off another car if it was their
daughter in the car behind them.  They might dip their high beams if it
was their grandmother they were blinding.  Common curtesy is non-existent
for people who treat other humans not as people, but as objects to move
or get around.

I think we all took psychology in high school or college, and read about
the experiment where the tester increased voltage to lethal levels to 
punish anonymous test-takers for incorrect answers.  People are very
callous and inconsiderate to those outside their &quot;personal&quot; society.

I think that the number of people each person can say they are &quot;related&quot;
to (such as the members of this list constitute a kind of &quot;family&quot;) is
so small when compared to the total number of people we are in contact
with, that nearly all the people we have close proximity to (passing
someone on the freeway, walking in the shopping mall, etc) are in fact
total strangers.

Thus, the people who piss us off by not using their turn signals, or
not flushing the toilet, etc., etc., etc., probably have some &quot;beefs&quot;
with us as well.  If only we could communicate these misunderstandings
between us, instead of stereotyping groups of people based on our experiences
with a few individuals.

&gt; Whew, I feel better now.

Hmm.  I don't.
