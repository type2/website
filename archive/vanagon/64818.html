Subject:      Getting to Fresno

We are planning a trip to Fresno from Port Angeles WA. along the coast as
far as we can before cutting inland.  We would prefer to return a different
way, perhaps through Union Oregon.

Any suggestions on campsites or roads that are must see or absolutely stay
away from?  Replies by email to earlsmit_at_islandnet_dot_com  much appreciated as
I don't always get time to read the listserve mail.
