Subject: '85 Starter Query

Lets see hmmn on the right list, oh yeah this one
leaks, uh, err, pumps water, just look at puddle.

Sorry but now for real question.  Starter died suddenly on
the '85, upon removal I could not dissasemble I mean rusted
together solidly, so local parts place say $96.40 lifetime
rebuilt, I say ouch but better than Bosch/Lucas rebuild so
get it.  Comes in I try to put in, no go.  Take back look carefully
at both, my origional (85 MT 1.9 BTW) has the 2 bolts in line
with armature, rebuild has bolts offset and further apart (which
I had figured out)  now funny thing is it looks like rebuilder
built starter on wrong cast mounting housing, cause part number
on the motor is the same.  So before I have him order another
someone want to tell me, is my origional correct, bolts about 4&quot;
apart and in line with armature or is something screwy (later tranny
maybe? but I have most records from new and no reason to suspect
this)

John
