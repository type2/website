Subject: Lost my Vanagon Headlights!!

A few months ago when I left work I noticed rather quickly that my
headlights did not come on when I hit the switch. The parking lights worked
fine. When I got home I checked the fuses, pulled the switch out, wiggled
the little relay things and when I put it back together, MAGIC! It worked!!

Well when I came home the yesterday, same story only no more MAGIC! Any
ideas? Is this a common problem?

PS: Does anyone else have this special Vanagon feature? I cannot lock the
driver's door by just pushing down the little knob and closing the door. I
have to use the key to lock it from the outside. It works if I am inside the
Van. I guess this way I won't lock my keys in the Van.;-)
