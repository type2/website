Subject: 914 gearbox in bus

Folks,

Can anyone tell me if it is possible to fit a Porsche 914 5-speed gearbox 
in a bay window bus with an upright motor?

914s are as rare as hens teeth in Oz but I believe that there are plenty 
in the States. Can you get reconditioned 914 5-speed boxes and how much 
would they cost?

By the way, a 26yo supercharged VW won the open (as in open 
wheeler) class of the Australian Hillclimb Champonships at the weekend. 
It beat a specially imported English car with a fuel injected 2 litre 
Vauxhall engine. A fuel injected 351 Chev came third.
