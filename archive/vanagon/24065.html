Well, just got back from the SOTO meet at Ansel (sp) Hoffman

Kinda boring, actually.  Seemed like most of the same busses, although
there was a '54 kombi that I would have loved to have!  Charlie Hamill
was there with his Ambulance.

There was also a '54 pickup that was pretty nice.

Seems the pattern is about the same:  The nice busses get there early, and
then about 11:00 or so the frankenbusses show up.

Managed to sell a set of wheels for $50.  I paid $40 for them, so I think
this is the first recorded instance where I actually made money buying
and selling parts.

There was one vehicle which I could only call the Abortion Bus.  It was
a '64 sliding door panel, with  a sunroof welded in, sorta.  Ya see, he
welded the cip in, but doesn't have the mechanism...  He welded a piece of
steel over the skylight window section, welded up the window on the rear
hatch, installed some highly modified caddilac fender skirts.  The bus
is chock full o' bondo.  It makes one nauseaus (sp) to even look at
it.

Another &quot;interesting&quot; bus was a '63 23 window that this kid picked up for
$200.  One word: RUST  Now I see how you mid-westerners and northwet and
easterners feel.  I told him I'd take it off his hands if he wanted to sell
it.

Everyone went to Pescadoes afterwards, but I went home and took a nap.

All spelling errors are a figment of your imagination.
