Subject:      Extra fuel tank (?)

while crawling around under the ol' girl, replacing all the rubber bits on
the fuel tank, I got to thinking .... how about moving the spare tire
'somewhere' else &amp; putting a tire shaped auxiliary fuel tank where the
spare was, &amp; tie it into the main tank with an upper &amp; a lower hose &amp; gain
another 10-15 gallons???
