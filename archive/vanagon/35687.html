Subject:  list stickers

Hey all

Well, despite all my bus's goofy electrical problems, something good did
happen today.  I got my list stickers!  These are very nicely done.  I put
one in the lower left corner of my rear window.  I was gonna put
another one on the windshield but I can't decide where it should go.

Sean
