&gt;From '74 on, westies had a double bunk up top. The roof cut-out was
enlarged from the sunroof size and a plywood base installed to provide a
flat surface. The bunk is hinged to allow full headroom, ( just over 1/3
of it folds back on itself), and is padded with 2&quot; foam.

It is a great addition IMHO
