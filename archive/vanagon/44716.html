Most people I know who have coolers in their engine compartment have the
hot side of the cooler routed out through the floor of the engine
compartment, which takes care of that problem.

&gt;If you put it under the van, it will get wiped off the first time
&gt;you go over something in the road.

Agreed.

&gt;I read a lot of posts about temps. These things were made to run in the
&gt;Sahara desert! Kind'a like the SW as I remember it! :&gt;) If your
&gt;timing is set correct, cooling system is intact, and you run good oil you
&gt;sould be fine.

If I may add one more thing,  &quot;And if your compression is not too high&quot;.

&gt;Remember, people will sell you anything. Even if it doesn't work.

&gt;Can anyone in the group find a referance to what a *HIGH* oil temp is?

&quot;How to Hot Rod your VW Engine mentions 270 as &quot;appalling&quot;, if I remember
correctly.
