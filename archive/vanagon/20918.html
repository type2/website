Subject: Bus Names

Hmmm. Lotsa mail about names, a subject of particular interest to me.

My former bus names:

'74 Westy--Ulysses (I liked Odysseus better, but it was too long)

'76 Westy--Hal (full name--HAL9000) This was the first van I had w/fuel
injection and the &quot;Brain box&quot; controller. It gave me quite a bit of trouble
for awhile. I always felt pensive opening the rear hatch for engine work.
You know,
 &quot;What are you doing, Dave?&quot;
&quot;I'm adjusting the points, HAL!&quot;
&quot;I'm sorry Dave, I can't let you do that.&quot;
&quot;I'm blowing the hatch, HAL!&quot;
And so on. He settled down after 6 months or so, and stopped catching on
fire and stuff like that.

Finally, my '87 Westy, formerly (infamously?) named &quot;The Great White Appliance.&quot;

For better or worse, his name is now Kalypso, Odysseus's ship in the
Odyssey. (you can make the ref to Jacques Cousteau too, if you want, but he
copied it from The Odyssey too).
Why the &quot;K&quot;? Well, current scholars say (argue) it should be a K, not a C.
Besides, it helps keep people from thinking he's named after the Calypso dance.

He still is occasionally called The Great White Appliance, though, and my
friend Kevin wants to make a vinyl Whirlpool sign to put on the rear side. I
dunno about that. 


Peace,
Dave
