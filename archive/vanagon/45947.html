&gt; I'd appreciate any leads on where to purchase a new heater motor.  The best

&gt; I've held off replacing my heater motor.  
&gt; 
&gt; Several years ago I looked into rebuilding these units, but was unable to 
&gt; find a source for bearings or brushes.  Doesn't seem like it is worth the 
&gt; effort to remove one just to lubricate worn out bearings.

I agree, it would seem unwise to do all the work, then have it fail 
again. On the other hand the fan in my '85 Jetta has squealed on &amp; 
off for at least 2 years now, or about 70k driven daily, with the fan 
*always* on. Since it takes 7 seconds (ok, maybe 10... ;) to remove 
the fan in a Jetta, I just oil it whenever it bugs me enough. (only 
had to do it about 3-4 times in 2 years...) 

I'm not sure how the fan compares to my '88 Westy though, since I've 
never *seen* the d*mn thing!
