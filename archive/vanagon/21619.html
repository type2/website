Subject: Syncro Popular, not! and H2O heaters

Syncro owners, alone in a crowd. I posted a note in rec.autos.4x4 asking for 
opinions on said vehicle, trolling for flame bait I guess. Two takers only, 
nice people, one South African who had pulled a loaded Syncro off a beach, 
and a former owner Jim Macklow of the list, also helpful. Nada mas! Scanned 
the 4x4 bio-summary, not a single Syncro, out of hundreds and hundreds of 
folk. Syncros are rarer than Hummers! Looks like any quest for spare parts 
may prove futile.

Phoned Webasto about my Syncros H2O engine heater. They'll send a tech 
manual, free, asap. I asked about 'domestic' hot water heating with mine, 
told it was a good unit for that, can take long duration switched on. They 
sell a higher output unit with dual level control, 8KW max. This is a lot of 
heat! And for around $2200 it's yours! I hope I can get mine running, hot 
showers galore, if not then that copper coil idea sounds way cheaper.   tim s.
