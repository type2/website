Collant bleeder valve

&gt; OK, so I finally got up enough energy to replace the coolant 
&gt; in my 85 Vanagon and have the following question about the 
&gt; air-purging procedure.
&gt; 
&gt; I have read Bentley's procedures for jacking up the front and
&gt; removing the bleed screw on the radiator, etc.  He also states
&gt; that the bleeder valve on the coolant hoses in the engine 
&gt; compartment should be opened.  However when I do this nothing 
&gt; comes out.
&gt; 
&gt; Is my bleeder valve clogged, or does this valve just open a 
&gt; passage to that little 1/4-inch hose that runs from the bleeder 
&gt; assembly to the adjacent steel coolant pipe?
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone who has done this knows the answer, I would appreciate
&gt; a reply.  I don't know whether or not to replace my bleeder 
&gt; assembly.  TIA!
&gt; 
Your valve is not defective, just unscrew it all the way and then 
gently *pull* back on the stem.  It will come out about 1/4&quot; or so 
more and prodigious quantities of air and  coolant will flow!  Things 
they don't 
teach you in school, eh?  Also, here is an easy way to bleed the 
system at the front of the van.  Take out the top radiator plug per 
coolant bleeding procedure but then attach a fluid recovery jar and 
 a vacuum source to the screw hole.  Suck out the air - keep refilling 
the coolant jug and you're set. Let me know if you folks want a more 
verbose description of this whole process.  It really works.
