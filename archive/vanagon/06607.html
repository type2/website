So martha rubin says:
&gt; Is there any way I can vent the existing westy stove thru
&gt; the existing &quot;refirgerator&quot; vent, so that, apart from depleting
&gt; oxygen supply, the stove would be a safe method of heating
&gt; the interior?
&gt; 
&gt; /martha
&gt; 

Well... if you insist on the risk of literally flaming yourself, 
the easiest way to vent for the stove is to just open a window 
an inch or so.  You're trying to bring IN more oxygen so that 
the flame does not deplete the oxygen for breathing.  

But if you get burned, I'm not cleaning up the mess.  ;)
