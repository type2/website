        It's probably something simple and less exotic like a generator 
mount/oil filler.

        It's been so long since I owned an early sixties bus, I don't recall if 
the mount was integral to the block or bolted to it.

An acquaintence of mine was telling me that his car pool partner has &quot;some 
old VW stuff&quot; that he was trying to sell but didn't know what it was worth. 
&lt; Schwing! ;) &gt;
This acquaintence said that this person has an old &quot;really rare&quot; intake 
thing that &quot;came off of an early 1960's bus. It was off of one of those 
really tiny motors, you know, it must have been one of those 1600's or 
something.&quot; (Right!)
The item was described as being a rectangular cast aluminum or magnesium 
&quot;intake intercooler looking box.&quot; For the life of me I can't imagine what it 
might be. I mentioned that (of course) I was kinda interested in seeing the 
item(s) for sale. (pant, pant, drool, drool) Supposedly this source has 
&quot;piles of trans axles and engines.&quot; I asked if this rectangle thing had any 
writing on it. Did it say anything like Judson or Speedwell? Did it have any 
rubber tubes and glass bottles attached to it? No answer...
     
Does anyone have any idea of what this could possibly be? I definitely 
intend to investigate but if history is an indicator, I would hesitate to 
bet my lunch on this acquaintences word or description. My only guess is 
that it might be either a T3 injector box (not from an old bus), a regular 
dual port manifold setup that for some reason is not disassembled, it is 
something thatI am unfamiliar with, or the fella was just out to lunch. In 
the last case I might stumble into other useful stuff just prior to Arizona 
swap meet season. :)
     
We'll see...
