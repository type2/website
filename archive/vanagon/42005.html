        Gerry Skerbitz said that he acquired an '82 Westy diesel 
for his wife for mudder's day.  Then I wept as I read he was
going to give that diesel the boot in favour of a gas pot!!  Those
diesel Vanagon's are rare anyway, but to convert to gas just
pushes the species closer to extinction......arggghhhh!

        What's the scoop, Gerry?  Does the diesel motor exhaust
bring out your allergies, or are you just frustrated with the
turtle power of that little powerplant?  Is the diesel on its last
legs anyway?  What would thrill me is to hear you were going
to put in a turbo-diesel (as I have done) in order to give some
dignity to diesel Vanagons.  Am I fighting a losing battle?
