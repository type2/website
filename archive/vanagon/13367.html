Ok, somebody please tell me if this is crazy.  I have a '71 bus with 
an engine that is un-rebuildable.  I say this because it has very low 
compression, huge leaks from a number of places, it has been severly 
overheated by me before I knew what I know now, and it has had bearing
knock for some time.  All of this adds up to a whole lot of new parts.
This lead me thinking about a Berg or similar but that quickly became 
cost prohibitive.  So I thought of building a motor myself from new or
reconditioned parts, mostly stock, from RMMW.  This got to be 
expensive and scary for a relative newbie.  Sooooo, RMMW sells GEX 
rebuilds.  I can get a 1600DP with a new case and heads and 
reconditioned crank, rods, etc for about $1010.  This is without my 
core going back to them and includes their 3/36,000 warranty.  I plan 
on installing a Bosch alternator, dual Kadrons, extractor w/single QP,
no heater boxes and an 009.  If I can afford it I will install
elec ignition later.  I know there are a million opinions out there, 
give me yours.  I am getting itchy to use all those tools I have 
purchased.  Thanks, Jim
