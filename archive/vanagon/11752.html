Subject: Re:heating 

&gt;I've been on the list for a week and can't believe the activity.  This is 
&gt;my first posting...
&gt;I am noticing a lot of concern about air heating techniques.  Personaly, 
&gt;I only experience these when traveling far from Tampa on the wrong 
&gt;seasons.  
&gt;I would like to sell my rear heating unit which I removed for space :] 
&gt;It should be more than perfect, It has been sitting for almost a year.  
&gt;Lasta time I used it was on that nameless storm a couple of years ago.  
&gt;It was helpful keeping me warm while fighting the violent crosswinds from 
&gt;Tampa to Washington...
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, if you are interested, I'm sure we can negotiate!
&gt;
&gt;Cheers

Uh, like a gas heater?  Or are we talking about something else?
