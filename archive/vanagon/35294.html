Subject: AFM 4 sale

     

     
     Hope I'm not violating netequitte, ......
     
     I have an AFM that I purchased cause the goffy mechanic was sure that 
     was causeing my motor not to run (the problem was the temp. sensor) I 
     picked this one up at a junk yard and it &quot;was tested&quot; by the folks 
     there with an ohm meter.  Don't know anything more than that.  
     
     The Bosch # is 0 280 200 028 and i'm asking $75 + shipping (which is 
     what I paid for it).
     
     cheers -
     
     john
