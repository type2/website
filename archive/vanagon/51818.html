Sean that sound low to me, were you driving into the wind or uphill?  I
get about 17-20 MPG on my 86GL, I got 22 MPG once with the wind behind
me on a real windy day.  I drive a compination of city and hwy.

Check your tail pipe and see how much soot there it.  With a good CAT
and O2 and all it should look pretty clean after a highway run.  If it's
black you're burning rich.
