&gt; I am to my last straw on my carb on my 71 bus so I am now going to

&gt; find a rebuild kit?  Also, I notice the price of the float is listed 
&gt; seperately.  Am I correct in assuming that I should go ahead and 
&gt; replace it at the time of the rebuild?  Also, Muir would have me 
&gt; remove the electromagnetic cutoff valve and the autochoke.  Ideas on 
&gt; this?  If removing the former is a good idea where do I get the plug 
&gt; he talks about for filling the hole?  I have pulled it and checked it 
&gt; and it does work.  Thanks for the help.  Any other advice about what I
&gt; should be looking for or doing while I have this thing apart would be 
&gt; appreciated.  Jim

  Have you checked _everything_ in the ignition already? Carbs are much
  less likely to fail than the more wear prone items in the ignition 
  system.

  You have probably already posted what the symptoms were and I apologize 
  because I don't remember. Carb problems, in my experience, go something
  like this:

    No idle, but runs great with the throttle open - This could be the pilot
    circuit in the carb or a manifold leak, like the rubber boots on the intake
    manifold or the power brake circuit. It can also mean that 12 volts is 
    not getting to the idle cut-off solenoid or the pilot cut-off solenoid. 
    I personally have never had a solenoid fail but have had the wire break
    twice.

    Big &quot;flat spot&quot; when throttle is opened suddenly - This is likely to be
    related to the accelerator pump circuit in the carb. A torn diaphragm or 
    a clog somewhere. A torn diapragm will usually also be evident as a gas
    leak from that part of the carb. More rare is that the little tubular jet
    from which the accelerator pump sprays the gas right down the gullet of
    the carb will come undone and fall in. Not so likely, but it has happened
    to me.

    No power and/or doggy running at full throttle - This is when it's like
    driving through molasses. Not missing or cutting out (see ignition), but
    it's got the slooooooows. This can be caused by insufficient fuel: the 
    main jet circuit, clogged fuel filter (remember, there is one built into
    the fuel pump AND one in the tank at the outlet fitting), bad fuel pump, 
    clogged vent in the fuel tank evaporative collection circuit, etc..

    I'm sure there are some other symptoms that I haven't mentioned, but these 
    are the ones I have experience with. 

    I don't agree with Muir on disabling the solenoid operated stuff or the 
    automatic choke. Living where you do in winter, you may need that choke
    more than Muir might have thought. Maybe a manual choke conversion kit?

    One last thing, a source of carb trouble can be excessive clearance 
    between the throttle shaft and the carb body due to wear. This would 
    show up as lousy idle. You can check for this by putting a few drops
    of thick oil on the throttle shaft to momentarily seal the leak. Repair
    requires having bushings installed or getting a new carb.

    Good Luck!
