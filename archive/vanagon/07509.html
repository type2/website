&gt; 
&gt; don't know tons about the synchro, but isn't it more like a limited slip
&gt; differential, rather than true 4WD? BTW I have heard that the Synchro's get
&gt; shocking fuel economy.
&gt; 

The Syncro is a true 4wd.  It has a viscous coupling which acts as the center &quot;differential&quot; and
keeps the front and rear axles spinning at roughly the same speed.

Fuel economy for my '87 is about 20 highway and 15 city (this is not a camper).  I know
my fuel injection system is not performing perfectly, so this will probably improve
when I track down the culprit in the engine compartment.

&gt; &gt;     My family has outgrown our trusty 4WD Civic wagon, and as a fond
&gt; &gt;     former owner of an early Type II, I'm thinking about starting a search
&gt; &gt;     for a Syncro camper. I'm looking for general advice, such as
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     1) Effectiveness of Syncro vice 2WD? We use the Honda extensively
&gt; &gt;     in snow, and for reaching remote trailheads for backpacking... not
&gt; &gt;     hardcore offroad, but some very marginal roads/tracks.

Very good for this.  The vanagon syncro is full-time, so you never have stop to engage,
or back up 20 feet to disengage.  Very good in snow (as Derek Drew will attest) with the
right tires/chains.

&gt; &gt;     2) Technical problems with Syncro vehicles? Anything special for
&gt; &gt;     a prepurchase inspection?

Trannies are weak.  Every part of the running gear from the transmission forward is so 
expensive as to blow your mind.  Checking dealer prices (there are almost no aftermarket sources):
cv-joint boot kits ($54 outer, $46 inner),  half-shaft (new) $1000, rebuilt transmission $3400,
front wheel bearing $300. (these are _parts_ prices)

I assume that the shocks for the front are also in the triple-digit range.

As with most full-time 4wd, the outside edge of the front tires get more wear than the rest.  Inept
alignment usually compounds this problem, so the inside of your front tires look new, while the
outside is worn down to the steel belts.

Since there's so few of them, very few mechanics know how to work on the syncro-specific areas. The
above prices give an indication of how painful a mechanic's mistake can be.

&gt; &gt;     3) any other things I should consider

They are so nice that even with the horrendous prices you'll pay when things go wrong, you'll
still keep on driving it.

&gt; &gt;     4) any such vehicles which might be for sale.

The campers are incredibly expensive, and demand justifies the high price.  I think they sell higher
than the new-car price they had originally.
