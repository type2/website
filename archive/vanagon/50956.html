Subject: Re: 87 Synchro CV Boots

I get my dealer-only  parts at Belmont VW.    They are generally pretty
good in the parts dept, but no special deals (no non-standard ripoffs
either).   Reliably get things they don't have in stock in 1-2 days.
Best non VW place I've found is Import and Domestic Auto Parts (IDAP) in
Burlington (272-0004).   They have really good prices on normal aftermarket
stuff.

&gt;I just bought and '87 Synchro, and an outboard front CV boot let go the

&gt;where can I get them?  Is there a split boot available (for a temporary
&gt;measure)?
&gt;
&gt;Also, where's a good place to get VW and Vanagon parts in the Boston
&gt;area?
&gt;
&gt;Was I surprised when I did a Net search for &quot;Vanagon&quot; and found this
&gt;mailing list.   Now I have something to look forward to when I check my
&gt;e-mail!
