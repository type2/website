Subject: 84 Intro, propane, airflow sensor harness

Hello,
I'm a new owner of an '84 Westfalia.  I've found this list and
the archives to be of tremendous value as I learn more
about &quot;Buttercup&quot;.  I have a couple of questions for your collective
knowledge...

1) How do I tell how full the propane tank is?  How long does a
   &quot;fill-up&quot; usually last..say if you let the fridge run and cook
   3 times a day?

2) I'm having some problems with intermittant engine cut-out/stalling, 
   and I'm thinking about trying some of the &quot;airflow sensor harness&quot; fixes
   mentioned in the archives.  There are two fixes mentioned: a) the
   $100 VW harness &quot;insert&quot; fix, and b) the &quot;capacitor across wires 
   2 &amp; 4&quot; fix.  Are these identical fixes?  I mean, is the $100 VW
   part really just a cap across wires 2 &amp; 4?  Since the FAQ mentions
   that the VW part does not have end to end continutity on wire 2 and the
   &quot;cap fix&quot; does have continuity I'm assuming these fixes do different 
   things.  Anyone have experience with this?

   Joel...I'm no longer a Lurking Grue.  You can add me to the stats!
