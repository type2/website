Subject: Begging for tent poles.

to All:
Once again, i'll bother you with my quarterly request for a set of tent poles, 
actually just the 4 corner 'birdfoot' ones.  if you have a trashed 
tent and want to re-coupe some $ out of it, talk to me.

Much thanx to all who(m?) have contributed their suggestions for 
fabrication of these buggers.  that will be a summer project one day, 
until then i'm still looking for the easy way out.  :)
