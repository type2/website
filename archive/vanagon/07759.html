Subject: '78 Westy manual ???

From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

A friend of mine recently got a 1978 westfalia, and is looking for the
camper part of the owner's manual only.(he got the tent too, by
the way- in *perfect* shape) I assume this would be the part
that tells about the stove, refrigerator, etc. 
If anyone has an extra to sell, or knows where he can get one, or would
be willing to copy yours for a couple bucks, please let me know at

rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu

thanks
Richard
