Okay I goofed.

BUT how much of the force needed to turn the alternator is mechanical and 
how much 'electrical'.

Bob's original point was that the alternator wouldn't charge the battery 
and power all the super spot lights.  That is not disputed is it?

At lower engine revs the turning of the alternator isn't enough to power 
all added equipment.  Suspect that the speed of the engine affects what 
percentage of the energy consumed by the alternator is elctrical and what 
is mechanical.

So now I'll shut up.

&gt; A simple non-VW experiment that can be run if you have a small permanent 
&gt; magnet motor such as used to power battery powered toy cars.  These, when 
&gt; spun, will generate electricity.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) With the motor disconnected from everything, spin the shaft
&gt;    with your fingers, and note how long the motor coasts.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Then, put an electrical load on the motor (generator) such as
&gt;    a flashlight lamp, or just short circuit the motor leads.
&gt;    Spin the motor again, and you'll find that the motor coasts
&gt;    far less, or not at all.
