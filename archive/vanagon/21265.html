Subject: Garage Door Tricks



To All:

Another common burglary trick is for someone working at or visiting a
residence to clip their own radio receiver to the two wires of the manual
control for the garage door opener.  They drive up, press the button of their
transmitter, causing their receiver to complete the circuit.  Your garage
door thinks the manual button was pushed and up it goes.  

If they're cool, the bad guys will splice the wires and only one cop in a
thousand would think of checking them.  If they're uncool, they just let them
dangle.  The bottom line is the same; automatic garage door openers are a
weak link in your security system.
