Subject:      another out-of-the-way junkyard for buses/vanagons

i went to a vw swap/sale meet today at a junkyard in Leeds, Alabama (about
30 miles east of Birmingham). for all you wannabee-bus-owners with lots of
ambition, he had a 1977 green (with original green-plaid interior) westfalia
for sale: $750. problems? well, yeah ... needs a fuel pump (car does not run),
cracked (not problem with visibility, but might not pass safety inspections)
winshield, cracked headlight lens, rusty spots all over (but did not see any
rust-through places). pop-top is dirty, whole bus needs cleaning up.

he had about 25 other buses of mostly 70's vintage, in varying states of
'junk'. several sets of the crank-out camper windows.

i counted 5 411/412 station wagens and fastbacks, 12 type 3 squarebacks and
fastbacks, lots and lots of beetles of all years, conditions, and colors, and
5 ghias.

also has a 21-window Samba bus with sunroof, no motor, lots of rust: $250.
and a 74 bus (no transaxle; has the motor) ... didn't write price down.

so for all you people within 50-100 miles of Birmingham, Alabama, he is:
Jim's VW's        (205) 699-5027 (ask for Jim)
800 O'Barr Road
Leeds, AL 35094

how bout it? anybody want to list other junk yards?

joel
