Subject: Mudflap - Big Bucks?

     Dang-
     
     I knew I scored a good deal yesterday, but I didn't know how much of 
     one.
     
     My local independent repair shop recently bought a BUNCH of odds and 
     ends from a defuct store in southern NM.  I picked up a set which 
     included the right-front and both rear mud flaps (the rear ones have a 
     VW emblem) new for an even $100 - now I've got a matched set.
     
     Before y'all get too excited, this was the only set I saw, but I'll 
     ask next time I'm in the store.

     BTW- is it mandatory on this list to give one's car a proper name?  
     
     &quot;I'm tryin' to think, but nothin' happens!&quot;
