Subject: 'Bye

Off to a conference on the west coast, then back home where it's finals
week, then :)  :)  :)  school's over.  I'm going to paint the Frau, send
Otto to the body shop, paint the house, and when not racing like a
jackrabbit on speed, just drive my Busses and read trashy novels.

See y'all later!  Back in June or so...
