Subject: Re: HELP!!-Pricing for '87 VW Camper

&gt;I found one!!!  I need help on it's value and what to look for.
&gt;
&gt;I have been wanting a VW Camper Van for over a year.  I just found out about
&gt;a '87 VW Camper van, GL model,  that is for sale 5 miles from my house in the
&gt;SF Bay Area.  It has only 39,500 miles on it has the pop top, fridge, stove
&gt;and sink, automatic transmission, air conditioning, cruise control.  It has
&gt;had only one owner and has been kept in the garage.
&gt;
&gt;He is asking $19,500.  Seems like a lot to me.  Is it?  What would you expect
&gt;to pay?
&gt;
&gt;I have never bought one of these before.  What questions should I ask about
&gt;the vehicle?
&gt;
&gt;I am going to see it tonight.  Any help or suggestions would be GREATLY
&gt;appreciated.  Please email me directly at:
&gt;

Unless this is a Syncro, the price seems way out of line, no matter how low
the mileage/good the condition (and even if it was a Syncro it'd be a bit
high for an '87).

If it truly is in &quot;like new condition&quot; I'd say a price more in the
$12,000-$13,000 range is more realistic.

Personally I wouldn't be interested just because it's an automatic. I think
the camper is too heavy/underpowered for AT (but I haven't driven one, so
if anyone has other experiences...). Make sure to take it up some long
steep grades and see how it handles them.

Also, make sure to get a good idea of why it has so few miles. Is it their
baby -  well cared for and used only for camping? Or was it abused so much
in the first year that it sat broken down in their garage for the past 7
years until they got tired of it taking up space and had some lowball
mechanic get it running on the cheap?
