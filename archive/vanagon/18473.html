Ben,

If you drill and tap your gallery plugs without tearing down the engine
you're running a terrible risk.

In Vietnam we performed some unusual service routines on aircraft engines
similiar to the drilling/tapping operation you have in mind.  We locked the
engine and pressured the oil system to 150psi, backed off the pressure after
the hole was cleaned up, turned on the pressure again as we began tapping.  I
can't tell you what a mess it was (plus the position we were working in) but
the operation was a success.... although it took the better part of 30
gallons of oil.

Why don't you try this:  center-punch the soft aluminum plug and a punch that
has an included angle that is nearly flat to swage the plug deeper into the
drilling.  I think this will result in a slightly tighter fit.
