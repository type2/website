Subject:      bike racks

what i've done on the EV is install a 1-1/4&quot; trailer hitch, then i have a
&quot;Hollywood&quot; bike rack that slips into it. The rack can fold down (although
it's a bit of a pain) but it had other features which made me choose it:
- you can tighten the piece that slides into the hitch, thus stopping rattles;
- there is a bottom bar which, when threaded with nylon straps, hold the
wheels;
- it has nice rubber cradles for the top tubes.

of course it does stick out a bit in the back - one has to be very careful
when backing up with this unit on.
