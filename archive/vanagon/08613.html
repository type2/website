&gt; 
&gt; I have to differ with you on the Type IV engine.  On my '74 the fan was smack
&gt; dab in the middle attached to the crank shaft.  But then again, I'm not sure
&gt; of the air routing/porting in the fan housing.  That would be the only other
&gt; obstruction flowing difference between cyl. #1 and #3.  
&gt; 
  Remember that the cylinders are not directly opposite each other. They have
  to be staggered a bit so that each connecting rod can have straight line 
  access to it's own journal on the crankshaft. The result is that cylinder
  #3 is further forward than cylinder #1, and therefore further away from
  the fan which is, as you recalled correctly, smack dab in the middle on 
  the end of the crankshaft.
