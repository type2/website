&gt; next: joel tells me _not_ to static time my bus.  muir says _only_ static
&gt; time it.  now joel isn't muir, but he seems to know what he's talking
&gt; about most of the time.  what should i do?  i understand how to static
&gt; time my car; should it be done?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You should do both. On type IV engines the static timing is almost invariably
  7 1/2 degrees BTDC. Do NOT static time at the setting prescribed for the
  running engine &lt;10 degrees ATDC for the '73, I think&gt;. After static timing,
  check the timing with a light and the engine running with all the tubes to
  the vacuum advance/retard unit connected. The timing should now have moved
  to the factory setting within a couple of degrees.

  Here's why I say &quot;do both&quot;. If your vacuum advance is defective or not hooked
  up properly and you set the timing at the factory setting of, say, 10 degrees
  ATDC you end up being 17 1/2 degrees retarded and you are looking right in
  the face of burned valves big time. Also, if you static time your bus
  at the factory setting for a running '73 you will get the same result! Not 
  a good idea.

  If you static time at 7 1/2 degrees BTDC, and your '73 doesn't move back to
  10 degrees ATDC when running, check the hose connection from the left &lt;flat&gt;
  side of the advance/retard unit to the carb and if thats okay, check that the
  diapragm unit itself is not leaking. 

  Bentley has a nice table which lists the amount of timing adjustment made
  by both the mechanical and vacuum devices. You can ascertain what the static
  timing should be by advancing from the running timing setting by the number
  of degrees listed in the vacuum retard column for your distributor #. I'll
  buy you a beer if it doesn't work out to 7 1/2 degrees BTDC. Both my '72 and
  my '74 calculated out to that although their running timing numbers were
  different and all the type IV engined buses listed there that _don't_ have 
  a vacuum retard are set at 7 1/2 degrees BTDC.


  Joel's right. Muir's right.
