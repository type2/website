Subject: Re: 83 wasserboxer swap?

&gt;the space without changing the inlet and exhaust. DMV are COMPLETELY
&gt;unhelpful about this- they won't even describe what *stock* is- they
&gt;basicly play dumb and tell you to put in the same engine it came with.
&gt;But you can call them and get a pamphlet. And if you're not in a
&gt;smog-certificate-every-2-years county, you could always Just Do It,
&gt;at least until it was time to sell the car :-)

What?  California DMV COMPLETELY unhelpful?  How can you say a thing like that?
