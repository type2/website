Subject: Where to keep my buds??



I'm hoping a good &quot;Subject&quot; will get good answers...we'll see. 

I'm a new bus owner (well, at least my wife is...;spankin' new '97 EV
Camper &quot;Happy&quot;) who used to be an old bus owner (I had several Type IIs,
but that &quot;old bus owner&quot; thing just doesn't sound right).

Anyway, I once had a lovely bud vase (which was an option on the Type
II) for putting fresh flowers on the dash (were you expecting
otherwise?) and I'm now wondering if anyone has seen a more modern (but
still attractive) substitute for Happy?

There's nothing like fresh flowers on the dash...
