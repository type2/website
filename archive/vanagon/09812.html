dave:

if you think seatbelts are an issue in 76' campers, try finding them in the
back of a 65' Westy- they ain't there! I had to install a seatbelt this
past fall so that our new baby girl (see sig.) could go for a ride in the
old bus too.

Re: Westfalia's- have you heard about Camp Box news- a publication that
Todd Swangstu (from Ohio) puts out. It is kind of neat reading aboout the
old busses.The publication mainly focusses on pre' 68 Westy's. If you want
to write to him i can get the address tonight. The publication is FREE.

&gt;&gt; well you have certainly taken it to a new level of detail dave! i was
&gt;&gt; referrring the info. more on a choice of appropriate beds than anything,
&gt;&gt; but i do enjoy reading a more detailed account of westy's through the
&gt;&gt; years. Somebody should really create a book profiling the evolution on the
&gt;&gt; various incarnations (Westy, Dormobile, Devon etc.) yjrough the years. I
&gt;&gt; know i would buy a copy!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I hope I haven't bored anyone with trivia. I ended up knowing more about this
&gt; that I would have otherwise liked on account of having three kids. Most
&gt; Westfalias built since '76 only have seatbelts for a family of four - hence
&gt; my more detailed survey of camper layouts and their passenger accomdations.
&gt;
&gt; I think a book on this is great idea. The last chapter of the &quot;VW Bus Custom
&gt; Handbook&quot; has some info, but it has better coverage of what was available
&gt; in Britain and there is no mention at all of some of the US built campers
&gt; like Safari, ASI or Country Homes.
