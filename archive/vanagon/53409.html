Subject: Tom Forhan's Party / Website update

Some info and pictures from Tom's Dec 14th party can now be seen at:

I did not get eveyone's name that was in attendance, so please feel free to e-mail me if it is missing or 
misspelled, etc.

Look for updates to the engine conversion and CV joint servicing pages in about 2 more weeks.


Thanks!
