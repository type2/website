Subject: My tire Q: Final decision

Ok, guys.  Thanks alot for your input.  I have finally made my decision.

Went ahead on ordered a set of Goodyear Wrangler GS-A's in a size of 
215/70x14.  They will be at my local Goodyear dealer on Wednesday and I 
will be having them mounted/balanced and the bus aligned on the same day.

Will post results.
