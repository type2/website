   Robb, 

   I'd recommend against copper tubing in this application. Copper is a poor
   choice where vibration is present since it work hardens and fatigues so
   quickly. You can demonstrate this to yourself by working a piece back and
   forth with your hands - it doesn't take long before is cracks and breaks.

   A crack in an oil cooler line could cost you the entire engine if it 
   went undetected for even a very short period of time. Stainless steel 
   tube, my good man, could be a very good investment here.

   Secondly, If doing an extra cooler, I'd put it in back and keep the lines
   as short as possible. Every bit of plumbing you add will have a pressure
   drop across it, and the cooler is in between the pump and the bearings,
   where pressure counts.
