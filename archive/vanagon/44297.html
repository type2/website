Subject: HELP--Snapped bolt in '84 engine block

Hi all.  

Well we made it to Oregon from Vermont with only my exhaust pipes blowing out
in Indiana.  Otherwise everything ran smooth.  The good news is that I had
already purchased the exhaust pipes in anticipation of the above.  The bad
news is that my brother snapped one of the bolts coming from the engine
block.  (We could never have gotten as far as we have without his brute
strength-these bolts have become one with the engine)  

Does anyone have any advice for us?  Is there any kind of tool that could
help us get the bolt out of the engine block?  There is about an 1/8th of an
inch of thread remaining.

If anyone can help me please respond directly to my brother's email as I am
currently off the list.  I have been suffering from vanagon list withdrawal
:(  Thanks in advance everyone.  I have been stranded outside of Portland for
a week with no wheels and am dying to explore the area.
