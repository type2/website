So Jerry Huff says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a friend that is looking into a '84 Weekender with automatic
&gt; transmission and A/C.  It has 143,000 miles on the original engine.
&gt; My friend has yet to see it but it is described as being in good
&gt; shape body/interior wise.  The guy is asking $3800.
&gt; 
&gt; Does that sound like a ball park figure?
&gt; 
&gt; What sort of mileage can one expect to get from a wasserboxer engine?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '84 Vanagon with 97,000 miles that I paid $2300 for.  It still
&gt; runs real strong and I felt like I paid on the low side for the shape that
&gt; it was in.
&gt; 

I would consider it a ball park figure if there is no rust and the camping
equipment is in good shape.  Check the fridge, stove, water pump, general
condition of the pop-top.  Weekender?  Does that version have all of this
stuff?  Or is it the Pop-top with 7 seats and a fold-out table?  Hmmm...
Check for cooling system problems like leaking head gaskets.  Ask the 
owner about it.  If he denies ever hearing of or never having problems,
I'd have my suspiscions and probably move on.  If the owner confesses to
having the heads be rebuilt, then I'd be more trusting and would consider
buying the vehicle.  Still $3800 is not too bad.  If this is the first
vehicle he's looked at, I'd look some more to get a good feel for your
areas market.

Good Luck,

Steven
