Ok, Ric, and Steven, you testosterone poisoned geeks are gonna get
klonked over the head by me and my cellular phone on the brick tour!
No, it is not a 900 number!!!!  What kind of girl do you think I am?
I converted to 976 LONG ago!

Just for that last round, I'm adding a parka to the long underwear
and flannel shirt with hiking boots.
