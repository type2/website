Please clarify for me whether we are to call on someone if we are
interested in a particular manual. I can see that Joel will be inundated
with requests. Does the process involve trade or payment? FWIW I have a
69 KG Manual, an 82 Westy Manual, including fridge and stove and  various
R and T Motor etc reviews of the KG, but not much for Westys. --
