Subject: Re: HELP - NEED YOUR ADVICE ABOUT BRAKE

&gt; My '66 Westfalia arrived today,

congrats!

 I would like to hear out your 
&gt;advices about front wheel brake, it is locked. I can't move it. I tried to 
&gt;bang on the disc brake wheel to loosen up the disc unfortunate it didnt 
&gt;work that way.

they have drum brakes all around.   either pull it with a tractor, or take
off the rim and pound around it with a hammer. 

&gt; Oh yeah its kinda rust and didnt run for 19 years. 

sounds like a great project.   i like the ones that sat a long time- hmm
 since  77  i hope no shag carpet (i make the VW sign as protection)    but i
bet the trans and front end aren't too bad.
