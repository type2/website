Subject: Bad Valves on on 84 Vanagaon

My Dad's got an 84 watercooled vanagon with 160k on it. It's in his garage
with two burned valves. He's been quoted $2,000 to get it fixed. 

Should he do it (and get another 30,000 miles on it) or sell it for
scrapmetal since everything else is just about to go bad?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks.
