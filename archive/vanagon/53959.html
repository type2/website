Jim,

Is your price from Camelback VW in Phoenix?  I think that the price for 
list members is 10% above cost.  I just bought a $14 expansion tank cap 
from them for $9.75 so the process works.  Even with shipping that should 
make a VW factory rebuilt competitive with the used engine which may 
influence you to keep the Vanagon.

Mike
