&gt;Can someone familiar with this problem post a picture of the offending

&gt;Mine are all clamped down. Now I think we're talking about the brass

Joe,

I've mentioned the following in a couple of my sermons but given the spate of
interest generated by the thread it's probably worth repeating.

The brass tubes pressed into the VW fuel pump and Solex carburetors have a
habit of working loose.  They appear to work loose more frequently when you
install a fuel filter in the line betwen the pump and the carb, a very
dangerous idea and one not recommended by any automobile manufacturer.  The
VW's fuel pump already has a filter, and the gas tank is fitted with a
strainer.  The troube is, no one bothers to clean them, or to maintain their
fuel tank.

The root problem is a rusty fuel tank or rusty fuel pipe.  The cure is to
eliminate the rust and re-seal the fuel tank.  I've a lengthy sermon
describing the process.

The problem with loose brass tubes is how to re-secure them.  The answer is
to make them larger in diameter by knurling.  You can do this using a file as
your knurling tool, pressing it hard against the brass tube while you roll it
back and forth on a block of wood.  You will emboss or knurl an impression of
the file's teeth into the brass.  This will increase the diameter of the
brass tube by some small amount.  Small, but enough to provide a good
interference fit when you drive the brass tubing back into whence it came.
 Before doing so, clean the bore and apply a dot of high strength loctite to
the tube.  (The green stuff, sometimes called 'Sleeve Retainer').  Prime the
hole so the loctite will cure quickly.  Strake the boss around the tube once
it is driven in for added security.

The sermon on making a bulkhead fitting for the fuel line where it passes
through the forward breast tin is also germain to this thread.

As to disconnecting the fuel line when preparing to drop an engine, the best
procedure is to clamp the hose before it is disconnected.  There are special
clamps just for tubing and Volkswagen used one of the more traditional
spring-clip types.  Most VW mechanics have one or two of them in their kits.
 Vise-grips, adjusted to provide about 1/16&quot; clearance will also work as a
fuel hose clamp.  I don't like the modern screw-type fuel hose clamps because
they take two hands to tighten.  The old VW clamp turns out to be the best
type for Volkswagens since you can do the job one-handed.

As a general rule, if you can indent the fuel hose with your thumbnail it is
elastic enough to withstand being clamped.  If the hose is so old it has lost
its elasticity, attempting to clamp it is liable to break the hose.  In such
cases the wiser course is to drain the fuel tank by syphoning, drain the
residue directly, and replace the fuel hose.  In smoggy climates the hose
will harden in as little as two years.

Attempting to plug a hardened hose with a pencil or fid will usually crack
the hose, allowing it to leak.  A bolt about 1-1/2&quot; long and of a diameter to
fit inside the fuel hose will provide a better seal although it must be
clamped in place.

Ideally, your fuel system should provide for a shut-off valve at the tank or
at the filter just down-stream from the tank.  Such valves and filters are
readily available and not to difficult to install on either the VW sedan or
Transporter.  

A filter should never be installed on the output-side of a pump.  The little
inline filters so commonly seen on VW's are as asperin to cancer and probably
cause more problems than they cure.  The added mass of the filter when filled
with fuel is probably a contributing factor in causing the brass tubing to
come loose.
