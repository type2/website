&gt; Of course, you might need a little more speed up in the frozen north
&gt; to overcome that thick oil.

You ain't seen nothing yet! Apparently temps get down to -30C around here
(that's the point when most Ottawans stop skating to work...).

 BTW I have
switched to 10w30 in anticipation of the season.

It may mean that over the short term, that I learn to park on hills. This
trick always worked for the KG when it wouldn't start....but I have heard
that push starting/roll starting a car with a cat can damage the cat
(something about raw fuel....) -- 

Thanks anyway for all the helpful ideas...DC
