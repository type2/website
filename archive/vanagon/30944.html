Subject: Re: repost: 71 camper for sale (IL)

Hey, I guess I have one of these very rare campers.  Mine is a 71,
westfalia hardtop and mine has air conditioning.  Orginal body in great
shape and runs well maybe I can ask 600.00 for it.

&gt;   1971 Volkswagon Camper, very rare, restoration halfway done.  Needs
&gt;   engine.    $300.00 firm.
&gt;       ---------------
&gt;   This bus is also known as a Westfalia Hardtop..  It does not
&gt;   have the regular camper pop up.  All parts are original,
&gt;   and it is a very rare car. Many new parts icl. battery,
&gt;   clutch, brake and accel. cables, recent brake and clutch job
&gt;    also has tires w/less than 75 miles on them with full
&gt;   warranty.  The engine has a rod thrown in it, but a rebuilt
&gt;   or used engine is easy to come by.  Many more new items
&gt;   put into this one.  call and leave message for Shelly at:
&gt;              1-(618)-867-2266.  (Illinois)
