Subject: Re: Antenna Replacement AAARRRGGGHHH!

Has anyone put in a power antenna in their vanagon?
Failing that how about one that maounts along the edge of the window frame 
for extra support. Or a hideaway one in the roof like my Honda ( I sold it OK!)
Stupidity and brush bashing have taken their toll on the current antenna.
