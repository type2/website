Hi, Richie, Buses should be pretty solid down in your neck of the woods, unless
they were from a coastal town, where the salt air could cause rust.  I think a
good &quot;starter&quot; bus for a young fella like you would be a '68-'71 Westy. (camper)
The engines are just bug engines, and they are alot easier to find/ replace/
work on than the '72-'79 type 4 engined buses. The '67 down split window buses
are cool, but parts are alot harder to find, and then there's the reduction
boxes etc., which can limit drivability.    I think a '68-'71 would be the way
to go.  Prices vary--- Often times you just have to be at the right place at the
right time.  Average prices for running driving reasonably solid  well used, but
not abused, '68-'71 Westfalias generally go from $500- $1500. more for nicer
ones, less for crappy ones.  Then again, you may just luck out and snatch one up
from the proverbial &quot;little old lady down the street&quot; that has that super
original low mileage '71 westy with the much sought after add-a-room tent (never
used, of course!) sitting in her garage, for only $300 bucks!

good luck and happy hunting........
