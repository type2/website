&gt; Mentioning that table, has anybody had theirs get stuck down?

Nope.  So far we've only had the occaisional bout of it NOT wanting to 
stay 'attached' to the wall while down.  Get a clunk, clunk as it swings 
a bit going around turns.  Its a little finicky about pushing in just the 
right spot.  Kids have more trouble than I do.

&gt; Right after I got the van, of course I was showing everybody all the cool 
&gt; things about it and went to pop up the table and it would not come loose.
&gt; 
&gt; It took a over a month of patient banging on the thing till one day, it 
&gt; just came loose like it was suppose to.  I haven't put it back down, 
&gt; waiting to check out exactly what holds it in there so well.  VW should 
&gt; have put a back door into getting that thing loose.

I'll check it when I get out to the van today.  Let you know if I see 
what might be your problem when I look at mine....
