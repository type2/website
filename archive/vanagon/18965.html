So Dan Houg says:
&gt; the Stove:
&gt; i like it.  made stir-fry for 9 on it one night!  

Dan, what kind of pan did you use to make the stir fry in?

Even though I have the inside stove, I still like to bring along
a coleman propane with a tank as I prefer to do my cooking outside,
Except when it's raining. 

&gt; the Sink:
&gt; use the sink for rinsing.   one bad thing:  the water faucet is 
&gt; nearly impossible to turn off with wet/soapy hands.  maybe ours is 
&gt; extra stiff but that knob needs a lever or a deeply indented grip.  

Mine's that way to.  Stiff and stubborn as can be.  The faucet handle
I mean!!!!   ;)   (Shut up Ric! You too Joel!)
