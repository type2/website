Subject: Towing a Bus

What is the best way to tow or generally transport a non running '73 bus
approximately 45 miles on mainly backroads.  I believe the bus is safe except
for the fact that the engine is dead.  I was recently pulled by a chain about
15 miles in a really beat up '73 bus and didn't feel particularly safe.  Once
I rented a type of trailer that just holds the front wheels, but the deal fell
through and I wound coming home with an empty trailer.  How do these trailers
work?  Any suggestions would be helpful.  If you recommend a rental item the
approximate rental price of that item would be nice if you know it.
Thanks
Brett

P.S.  I'm sure my girlfriend's mother will be thrilled when I tell her I'm
going to be storing another non-working bus at her house.
