This tale sums up nicely what I found out when I did my '56.  The Wolfburg 
West repro panels are crap.  I also used their hinge carrier, which was
1/2&quot; short, and their front floor pieces not only had the wrong angle, but
the holes from the clutch pedal and steering column were not even close - like
2&quot; off.

I get my panels from Das Bulli Haus from now on...
