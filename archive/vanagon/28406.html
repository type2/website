&gt;  Have you found any NOS 15&quot; rings?    Tell me if you find some, new or used.
&gt;  I want two more for the 61.

Let me put it this way.  I have a *friend* who has two 15&quot;
rings that he was looking to trade for something.  He wanted
some idea of value.  I said I'd ask.

My understanding is they are not NOS, but excellent
condition originals (not held on by hub cap as I
understand).  Should I call him tonight and ask if they're
for sale as well as trade?
