The TCVWC is looking for new members.  We meet at Westside Volkswagen located
at Highway 100 and Cedar Lake Road in Saint Louis Park.  Meetings are the
first Wednesday of the month (6 SEP this month) at 7:00 pm (1900 hrs).  Come
one, come all!!  The more the merrier!!!

1987 (drip...drip...drip) Syncro GL

P.S.
If you come tell 'em I sent you.  I do have a special interest in this.  The
member that gets the most new members gets something at the annual dinner in
January.  I don't know what it is, but_I_WANT_IT_!!!!!!!!! ;-)
