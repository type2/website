Subject: Power steering Fluid  for '90 Vanagon

 I am low on power steering fluid and the manual says to use Dextron to fill
up the reserve. Well that was good in 1990 but I don't think you can find
dextron now. All I can come up with is Dextron III ATF fluid. I assume that
this is compatible but.....Do YOU know for sure. Would appreciate a quick
answer so we can start driving the Van again.......Thanks Bill
