Tim Wise and SyncroHead,

Somewhere on this list, within the last few months, one of our members
contributed a detailed, hose-by-hose, account of sources and prices from
FLAPs and other nonVW sources.  If I remember correctly, he reduced the
usual $500 to $600 saga by about 75 per cent.

The account may be in the Archives, or our Hose Expert may see this message
and repost the information.

I think that I printed it and filed it in a cabinet in another location
which I can't access.  If you don't find the information, I'll look in
about two weeks when I return to my home.
