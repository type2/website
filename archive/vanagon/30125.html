Subject: Major Breakthough


TO: Anyone Interested!



	A major breakthough in 1 and a half years restoration of my '62
	camper was made this weekend. We (me &amp; dad) got it started and 
	drove it around the block! We could not get the engine started 
	with the van stationary so i pushed it and dad steered and just
	like that it fired up and off it went down the road. This was
	quite a feeling seeing it driving after the amount of work we
	have done on it, it must be the first time its moved alone unaided
	for nearly 13 years. Unfortunatly the work does not finish here, we
	can't get reverse gear for some reason which is a bit of a bummer
	so i am going to have to take the engine and gearbox out again this
	weekend (we only put them in a week ago) and see whats wrong.
	
	I hope to be driving it for christmas!! and its just started snowing
	in London.


Cheers,
