Subject: Re: Firearms and Inuvik?

&gt;VanBondo is not going on the Inuvik trip but had a random thought go off.
&gt;
&gt;Let's suppose &quot;someone&quot; wanted to pack while on the Alaskan Hwy. Let's also
&gt;suppose that it's illegal to carry firearms into Canada. How does &quot;someone&quot;
&gt;get the weapons (protectors of the ass) into Alaska? What are the applicabl=
e
&gt;laws? What permits are required?
&gt;I personally have as many weapons as I have skateboards...

Simple.  You get yourself a black powder kit from Cabela's or some such,
begin assembling it after you cross into Canada, and have it just about
ready as you cross the border into Alaska.  Then you hope you can buy some
powder, caps and balls in the far north.  Toss all the explosives on the
way back and disassemble the kit.  Of course if you get beset by bears in
northern Canada you'll be filin' and sandin' to beat the band.
  By the way, the NRA has a page of gun laws per state if you want to know
the regulations in Alaska.  And we need not &quot;suppose&quot; it's illegal to carry
firearms into Canada.  I think &quot;someone&quot; would find the Mounties
non-negotiable on that point.
