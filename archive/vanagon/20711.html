Subject: Type II model sighting

I'm not sure if this has been spotted yet, but my bos just brought this in to
me...

As seen in Hammacher Schlemmer (Mid-summer 1995, pg 26);

1966 VW Transporter Model is a detailed replica of the famous &quot;microbus,&quot; the
spartan but incredibly practical vehicle that faithfully served families,
delivery companies and communes of &quot;flower children&quot; throughout the 1960's and
70's. Officially titled the Transporter, it borrowed the same flat-four engine
design of the immensely popular &quot;Beetle,&quot; and although it had a top speed of
just 72 mph, it did have enough room for eight passengers and could also be
easily converted into a service van. Our 1:18 scale model is made of die-cast
metal and plastic with rubber tires. Rear hatch opens. 8 and 7/8 inches long.
65622M...... $29.95

Display case. Oak with clear acrylic cover for this model and other model cars
up to 12 and 3/4 inches long.
65623M...... $39.95

All that I can see interior-wise is the steering wheel so I have no idea how
complete it is. It's two tone, white-over-red, with white wipers, chrome
outside rear-view mirrors, bumpers, door handles, and hub caps (w/ the VW
insignia on the front and on the hub caps), and even white rims.

The front wheels are cranked about 20 degrees left so the steering might even
work a tad!

Looks pretty sweet.

Hope this piques someone's interest.
