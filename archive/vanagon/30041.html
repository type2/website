&gt;Are all, or mst diesels in older buses really that weak?  I would like to

&gt;I have to admit that the rumble rumble of those motors sounds really 
&gt;neat.  I was told that they are very underpowered. Is this true...diesel 

I own a diesel... ('82 - NuBus), and I have seen the best and worst
of the diesel....

The power is, admittedly, low. I can, however, cruise at 70MPH if I desire.
I also have some heat (the '82 gas burner is aircooled).

The diesel engine is the same one they put in the cars (Dasher, Rabbit), so
at 49 hp, don't ask for much.

I *do* get 30 MPG, and diesel is cheaper.  It *always* starts, even when I
lived in Upstate NY.

Down Side - 

1) The engines seem to last much less time than they do in Rabbits. 

2) Worn rings allow blow-by, and seals blow out.

3) not real easy to find mechanics.

4) Did I mention lack of power (You get used to it..really)

5) You *will* have oil leaks on the driveway.

6) You would become one of the &quot;bad boys&quot; of vanagon_at_lenti (no, not &quot;bad&quot;
like Ric is...not *that* bad...Jeez...he has a Eurovan....)

Anyway, just my opinion..NuBus us broken right now...I am a little down
on Diesel this week.
