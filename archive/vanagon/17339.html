     &gt;Apart from that it looks like a inofensive standard white/blue/red 
     &gt;camper, the only external difference being a porsche badge under the 
     &gt;VW one.
     
     I assume it's the one that is white with a blue and red strip down it.
     
     I've seen it a most of the family shows and I think it has a Porshe 
     tranny in it.
     
     Now you must have heard about my mate that's puttin' the 911T in his 
     23-window...
     
     We had to make some adapter bushes for the tranny spigot the other 
     day. He is putting the engine onto a 5-speed bus tranny with hydraulic 
     clutch. He had to get a bus flywheel redrilled to bolt to the Porshe 
     crank. The engine is as good as in now and uses Type III (I think) 
     engine mounts at the rear sides on to a plate that bolts onto the rear 
     of the engine. Oh, by the way he put a '74 chassis onto the bus body!
     
     Lee.
