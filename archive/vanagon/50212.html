Subject: heater boxes....


 anyone want or need 2 good used heater boxes?
 these are for a 1600 upright motor and still have 80% of the 
 gray primer still one them, they were not used for very long....
 i was saving them for myself, but i can't see any use for them in the
 near future....
 i also have a good used muffler for a 1600 upright, it's a little rusty
 but not bad, has lots of life left in it....i mean that it was good enough
 for me to save it...and that took some effort.
make an offer if interested...
patrick
