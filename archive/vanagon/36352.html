Tim,

You need to treat yourself to some fun reading.  You should get a copy
of the 'Idiot Book' and read the part about checking the electronics.
It's not that hard.  Muirs book gives you enough to get started checking
the basics which is usually what's wrong most of the time.  

You browse the book stores for other books that introduce you to electronics.
Maybe one of the Fuel Injection manuals would be good.  

You may even track down your troubles before the MG's do.  As a matter
of fact, I guarantee it.  ;)

Cheers!
