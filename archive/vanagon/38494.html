&gt; I discovered an easy connection for starting my '72 van from the

&gt; unit) and above that are 2 more connections that are verticle (not 
&gt; quite as large, but larger than most of the connections). If you 
&gt; jump the 2 verticle connections you will turn over your engine.
&gt; 

Then once the engine's upside down, it's easy to reach the starter...
