In a Vee-Dub Bus Again.
(to the tune of Wabash Cannonball)

&lt;chorus&gt;
Listen to the rattles, to the rumbles from the floor,
As we wind along the highways, through the hills and by the shore,
Hear that mighty little engine, as it screams against the wind,
A'Traveling through the country in a Vee-Dub Bus again!


Oh, the western states are dandy, so the western people say,
&gt;From the hills around St. Louie, to the Rockies, by the way,
But if you drive a Vee-Dub Bus, I'm sure that you will find,
The vista ain't so grand to you when numbness grips behind! :)

Back east, the states are wonderful, the eastern people say,
&gt;From the beans in Boston harbor, to Virginia and the Bay,
But people drive like fools possesed, like mountain goats and rams,
Your butt's still numb, and you feel dumb, in ten-mile traffic jams!

Down south, below the Dixon line, where temperatures can soar
Especially in the summertime, the heat you will deplore,
There's lots of folks to help you find just what you desire,
If you can understand their drawl, and light their butts on fire! :)

And way up north, around the Lakes, in Minnesota land,
They've smaller hills, and bigger farms, and lots of flatter land,
But it's not fun when summer's done, to stay beyond the fall,
Cause Winters here are quite severe on people, cars, and all.

Way out in California, where the earth plays Rock 'n Roll,
You can drive from San Diego's heat to mountain's that are cold,
Cause it's a state that's long and deep, with people everywhere,
And lots of Vee-Dub buses on the highways here and there.

Another state that's long and deep, the Lonestar stands alone,
&gt;From Marshall to El Paso, Amarillo, San Antone,
The roads are long, the cities big, and drivers are a fright,
They pass you doing eighty on the shoulder to the right!

Wherever you decide to stop for rest and gas to pay,
As you pull up to the self-serve pumps, the people seem to say,
&quot;Now, there's a bunch of crazies, old hippies, that's fer sure,
Still driving an old Vee-Dub bus, and fixing it by Muir.&quot;
