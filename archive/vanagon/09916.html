So David Schwarze says:
&gt; I think you meant the Chargers/Steelers game, right?  Who would want to
&gt; watch the niners?  What a boring team...   :)

David, 

You can't possibly believe for one instant that the Chargers are actually
going to beat the Steelers do you?  Regarding boring teams, yeah their
boring in the sense that they're always winning big time.  Oh well someone
has to do it. :p   

BTW, please scan those pics before I go home!  :)  I can't see them on my
dumb terminal.  

Also, thanks for checking the vintage faq site for me.  I'm on NTCA Mosaic
and can't seem to get the full page. :(

Cheers,

Steven
