Subject: Propane Tank Label

I suppose the truly paranoid could remove the label, paint the tank, and
then reattach it with silicone glue or some other moisture impenetrable glue.

But this idea that people are going to be checking the propane tank on your
van for the metal label is laughable. 

Next time someone checks for that label under my van, I hereby swear to eat
my wing vents.
