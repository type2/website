Subject: Transform?

Has anybody out there in Vanagon land ever dealt with Transform?  My '66 
stopped going backwards about a year ago and it is finally beginning to 
bother me.  Although it is against my credo to pay someone to 
rebuild a transaxle for me, I can't afford the downtime while I 
do it myself.   Any experiences -- positive or negative -- that you could 
share with me would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Tom
