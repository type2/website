Hi All,

I just wanted to post this.  I am interested in electric vehicles.  While in the 
library I saw a Volkswagen Bus that had been electrified.  The battery pack 
slide out of the area where you open the side door.  I was replacable so it 
could be changed out for charging or maintanence.  It slide out onto a special 
platform.  For what is worth.
