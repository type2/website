&gt;&gt;--Why is this thing so loud?
&gt;
&gt;It's just the resonant frequencies of surrounding objects reflecting the
&gt;ultra-quiet waves the VW exhaust emits, making the engine appear to give 
off
&gt;sound.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;--Why is this shifting thing so mushy?
&gt;
&gt;The shifting is actually very stiff, it's simply the geometry of the arm of
&gt;the driver relative the shifter that flexes the the bone of the driver's 
arm
&gt;imperceptibly that gives the &quot;mushy&quot; feeling.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;--Why aren't you out there working on my Honda?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The Honda doesn't exist.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;--Could you put air conditioning in this?
&gt;
&gt;Air is recirculated and conditioned naturally in the VW.  Cooler air can be
&gt;produced by driving through cooler climates.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;--What's wrong with it THIS time?)


It's not a bus-- it's a feature.   :^)


Or, if you like:

It's not a car-- it's a way of life.
