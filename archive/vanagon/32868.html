Subject: Re: Oil Warning Lamp (Was: CB Radio Oil...)

I find if I leave my 84 in the rain for a few days without driving
it, then drive it around the oil light comes on very dim for about
45 minutes or so.  I checked oil and the like and it's at a fine
level and circulating, so I'm not too worried about it.  Seems like
another phantom electrical connection.  Might put in a *real* oil
guage though....

&gt; I have found that transmitting a signal on the CB radio typically sets off
&gt; the little red oil warning lamp befoe the driver in late model Vanagons. Not
&gt; to be afraid, its just the CB; took me a few times to get the correlation.
