Subject:       1991 Syncro Westy for sale (CDN)

Hello everyone.  A few months ago I was trying to help a fellow 
member of the list locate a Syncro Westy.  He was looking into 
importing  a vehicle from Canada into the US.  He located a vehicle 
in the Seattle area, and then I believe unsubscribed from the list.  
I contacted the dealers in our area (Vancouver, BC), and left my name 
for when a good van showed up.  

So, without further delay, here's the info:

1991 Syncro Westy
120000 km (70000 miles)
cruise, A/C, pl, pw, diff lock
flash silver in colour
BBS rims with street  a/s tires
Condition:  rated 9.5 out of 10.. no accidents, original paint, etc.
$25,900 CDN

located at:  Westminster Volkswagen, Coquitlam, BC
Ph: 604-461-5000
Ask for Graham Turner.

Disclaimer:  I'm not affiliated with Westminster VW, but since the 
guy was very pleasant I said I would post this to the list.  He 
phoned me earlier about a Syncro pickup he had as well.

If anyone is genuinely interested, I can go and take a look at the 
van for them.

Harry.
