Subject: '82 Diesel, fuel, where did it go?


        A not so good thing hapened this week.  In Oregon it is unlawfull to
pump your own fuel (no self-serv).
        Due to a mis-communication (ya, right.  He didn't listen to me when
I said Diesel.  He also didn't read the Diesel Fuel Only sticker)my '82
Diesel got filled (he added apx 6 gal.) with un-leaded gasoline.
        Now I know that in a pinch I could have added a couple quarts of
non-detergent oil and been on my way.  But no, I told them to call a service
truck to drain my tank.
        I had my Bently book with me, that made the job a little easer.
After siphoning the tank the fuel line was removed from the bottem of the
tank untill no fuel came out.  After the tank was enpty (I banged on it, it
was empty) my guage still said it had about 1/4 tank left and when it was
refilled it took just under 12 gal to fill my 16 gal tank.  Where were the
other 4 gal hiding?
        It's run OK sense this happened, I am going to change the fuel
filter today.  The service truck guy said that this particular station makes
this same mistake about twice a month.
