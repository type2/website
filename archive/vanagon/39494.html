the distributer on my 60 crew cab is

	VJR 4 BR25

it is probably close to the same as the BR18 above.  my motor is the 
&quot;Bastard&quot; Intermediate motor manufactured around Nov. 1959.  if they 
followed a logical numbering system, then i guess that thom's unit was 
made some time befor that.

my bus parts book say's nothing about the BR18 distributor, so it 
probably was not offered on the bus.

take care and God BLess
