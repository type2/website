Subject: 82 Westy--Now I've Done It

Thanks all, for thoughts on this one.  

If this thing's a loser, I'm dead meat on a stick, because I bought it.  The
Absolutely Beautiful, Almost Mint 82 Westy with 138K miles.  I saw all the
service records (oil changes every 2K, everything kept lubed, etc. etc.).  I
guess, even if the engine goes before too awfully long, I won't feel TOO
bad, since the thing's in such beautiful shape. &lt;pant, drool&gt;

Engine compression is good (all above 100) appears to burn little oil, ball
joints are tight, brakes are good, CV's have been serviced...  Did I
overlook anything? Too late if I did...  :)

Related, we're going to sell Otto (can't bring myself to unload Die Frau).
1979, nice interior, body so-so, 166K, rebuilt engine &amp; clutch at 108K.
Sunroof.  Brown/beige.  Includes Campbell for Governor bumper sticker and
various college parking tags.  $1100?? I dunno...
