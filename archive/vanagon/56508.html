 The list manager can boot these guys off if they get to flagrant, and I
 trust his judgment -- and Ron's and Kyles, and BusBoys. I'm glad these guys
 are there -- they have the real expertise on this stuff that we all want 
 access to.  We need to make it worthwhile for them to be members of the list
 too.  Many of us don't know the front of a VW engine from the back, and are
 only info consumers.  We need to provide incentive for the info producers
 to remain reading all the posts -- there sure are a passel of posts on 
 this list!
