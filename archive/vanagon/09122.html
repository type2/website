Subject: BA6


	I just got my new motor from GEX in the old bus,
and got some new body panels for the rockers/fender.

A few things:
1) I hate body work.  I hate having weld splatter on me
and burn me, and I hate the smell of bondo and paint. ICK.

2) I forgot how damn cold the bus is.  its 7F here, and 32F
in the bus.  I have most of a  BA6 heater, but I don't
have the fan the blows the air under the seat, or exhuast
hosing, and some other misc crap.

Does anyone have any of this lying around?

Also, I forgot where all my vacum lines go (on a 77 FI 2.0L)
They either go to the air distrubitor or the throttle body housing.
I have all of them except for for the evaporative emissions
hooked up to the air distributor.

I would appreciate mail.  I have a amazing large amount of
digests to wade through....

Thanks
Matt
