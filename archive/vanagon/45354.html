&gt;Hi All,
&gt;  While adjusting the timing the other day I made a discovery I want to toss
&gt;out to y'all: It's an 1800cc\twin carbs engine, stock everything. Timing
&gt;according to manual is 10 deg. ATDC. That's the way I had it set until now.
&gt;I noticed though that it idles faster if I advance the timing a bit. So just
&gt;for the fun of it, I set the timing to 0 deg., and took it for a testdrive.
&gt;WHAT I NOTICED WAS THAT IT HAD A LOT MORE POWER THAT WAY. And I didn't
&gt;notice any knocking or overheating (I do have an oil temp gauge).

I run my bus close to 0 degrees as well.  It shouldn't hurt anything, as
long as the engine isn't pinging (it will be more likely to ping with
advanced timing).  The only time I set my bus to factory spec is for my
emissions check, which I no longer have to worry about since I live in
Texas.  Flame away, my bus still runs cleaner than 90% of the '73 busses on
the road.  :-)
