Hi Frank.  Thanks for the info.  I think I will write these guys and get them
to send me a catalogue.  It seems that everything for these vans costs an arm
and a leg!

Thx.
Harry

 &gt; Hi everyone.  The exhaust tubing (headers) for the Vanagon
 &gt; are horrendously expensive ($1400 in Can.), even the muffler is $600!!  This
 &gt; is unbelievable.  This is what my friend paid for his '88 a year ago at the
 &gt; VW dealer.  It seems that with the Vanagon, one MUST use VW headers and
 &gt; mufflers.  At the prices that VW charges for these parts, this is ludicrous.
 &gt; They should have been stainless steel from the factory given how these pipes
 &gt; are continually battered by road debris from the wheels.
 &gt;
 &gt; Does anybody know of a maker of an exhaust system for the vans (mine is a
 &gt; '90 Syncro) that makes a system from stainless steel?  I am trying to do
 &gt; some research before I am forced to buy more VW shares!
 &gt;
 &gt; Any feedback would be appreciated.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks,
 &gt; Harry.

 I don't know anything about stainless, BUT  there are much cheaper parts
 available here in Canada.    I went through this story myself a few months
 ago with my '87 Westy.  Canadian Tire has a muffler for $44.00 - YES  - I
 wrote $44.00 go check it out before you say anything.  They also have the
 tailpipe at about half the price of VW.  As for the pipes, gaskets,
 converter, hangers and any other parts check with: R.M.R. at 2495 Diab
 St., Ville St. Laurent, Qc., phone: 514-339-5722.  Their prices are much,
 much better than VW, AND the parts are original VW parts  !  Go figure.
 Anyways, good luck and hope you get through the exercise with ease.

 Cheers,

 Frank
