&gt;&gt; Question:  DId or do Campers come in only 1 color each year?

The '79 Camper was available in Sage  Green (P-22 model only) or Mexico Beige
(P-27 model only)

&gt;I've got a '78 with the original brown and white(top half).

I don't have a whole lot of info on pre-80 vans (only a 66 Westfalia and 79
Bus brochure), but I do have a 'Champagne Edition II' brochure from '78.
 Your '78 appears to be a Champagne Edition.  This is the only camper I've
seen that is not one solid color.  The other bus model shown in this catalog
is a non-camper, Fox Red over Date Brown, with three brown stripes along the
lower body.

Best regards,
Ryan
