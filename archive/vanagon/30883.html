Subject: Re: sunroof like in Jurassic Park


&gt;I really wish I had a sunroof to expand the angle of vision and double the
&gt;pleasures of sight-seeing. With a wide sunroof reaching far down towards
&gt;the windshield, we could see summets during mountainous drives.


Here in Pacific Beach (a Sandy Eggo suburb), there is a splittie
cruising around with no roof or windows. Zero, zip, nada, none. I
recall seeing something like this in a VW mag in the last year or so,
but it's great seeing one in the flesh. The ultimate roadster! And
it gets around the problem of trying to hang your elbow out those tiny
sliding windows up front.

I did something like this to a junker '66 Mustang coupe. Add a little
chrome here and there, and it looks quite real! Till it rains, anyway...
