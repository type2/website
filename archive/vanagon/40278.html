&gt; &gt; How interchangable/swap-able are the switches in the
&gt; &gt; master cylinder???  I was checking my connection out and

&gt; Pretty darn big window.  Something like 51-67, as long as you get push-on
&gt; and not screw-on terminals - they all have the same size thread.
&gt; They are something like $4 at Bugformance.

Great! Better than expected!  I figured $50 at the dealer, $30 at the 
FLAPs and $5 - $10 at the wrecking yard....  :)
