Subject: Re: Subject: 80 Vanagon Roof Racks??

I have an '81 Vanagon (Westfalia) - I'm guessing you're talking about the
poptop?

When I bought it, the guy threw in some racks that attach to the rain
gutters and lift the 1' or so to clear the poptop.  He used to carry a boat
up there and wanted a good solid connection to the steel.  They were made by
Thule.

The downside to this is that you cannot pop the top with the racks on.

Me, carrying windsurfing equipment up there, no boat, and wanting to camp,
wanted to be able to pop the top.  So I bought some Thule adaptor plates
that attach to the fiberglass poptop.  You drill holes in the poptop and
bolt these four 2&quot;x6&quot; artificial raingutters into the poptop.  You can then
attach any raingutter-accepting racks you want.  This seems like a pretty
strong connection to me.  Never any problems with leaking.

If I were starting from scratch, I would go with option 2 - get the
artificial raingutters from Thule and whatever racks you want.  

Hope this helps.

&gt;Does anyone know if there are roof racks for a Vanagon available and where?
