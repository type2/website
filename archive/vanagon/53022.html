Believe it or not:

The Camper runs 160 km/h downhill with tail wind. No problem
with the engine, but this was more than the tires would allow.

Regular cruising I did with 115 km/h because of fuel economy,
when I'm on hurry 130 km/h during a 500 km trip also no problem
(if the van allow this speed because of less power).

I have recently purchased a 1979 Westfalia with the 2.0 liter motor
and a manual transmission.  Becasue there is no tach, I have no idea
what a safe, long trip highway speed is.  Can I cruise at 65 with no
worries?  Can I go faster (downhill with a tail wind :) )?  Please let
me know what you think.

TIA,

Matt
