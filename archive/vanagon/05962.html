Subject:      for you camper types ...

in the new issue of VW T&amp;A ... er, TRENDS:

&quot;I am very pleased to tell you that our Westfalia Owners Travel Club is
expanding, and that we have started two new chapters.

One is in Newfoundland, and the other is in Ontario; and, of course, the
founding chapter is in New Brunswick that covers everywhere that the other
two don't ... including the USA.  We have quite a few members in the US and
some travel a lot down there.  We even have one member from Puerto Rico,
thanks to VW TRENDS.

I am enclosing copies of each card and we would be very appreciative if you
could publish them.  Our club is a Travel Club, we get together, as much as
possible, and take long trips at times, and some times just weekend trips;
but no matter where we go we are meeting new people, and really enjoying
our vans.

The club is strictly for Westfalia owners.  Thank you for the publicity that
you have given us in the past.  Happy trails.&quot;
