Subject:  re: Need Bike rack Suggestions

if you have a trailer hitch, a couple more ball-hitch mount bike rack
options are one from performance bicycles ($140, holds 3 bikes), or
graber ($70, holds two).  both pivot at the base so you can open your
rear hatch.  prices are approximate,  i have no experience with either
one (but i do want one).
