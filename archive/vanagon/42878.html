Subject: Beetles being GIVEN away -- READ THIS

Hey all,
MTV is having a promo in which a bunch of 1969 Beetles are going to be given
away.  These are Beetles which were used as promotional vehicles for Mug Root
Beer.  They're all painted up like that but they look REALLY nice as far as
condition.  Here's what you have to do.  Watch MTV (god forbid!) during memorial
day -- they're giving one away every hour -- and when they tell you to call and
give you the 800 number, call in and if you're the nth caller, you win.  Let's
all try to get these bugs rather than let them fall into the hands of teenagers
who don't know shit about air-cooled VWs and will inevitably trash them.

Let's get 'em!

Sean
