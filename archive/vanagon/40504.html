Subject: 71 camper advice

Hello,

I think that I am going to purchase a 71 camper. According to the owner it
has a blown rear seal (leaks oil), the taillights need work, and the
interior is missing some of the camping equipment. It has rust in the usual
places, behind the drivers seat on the floor (minor), behind both front
wheels in the wheel well and the rockers are very ugly. It starts right up,
but burns alittle oil. The whole thing (including the interior) is primer.
I think that it pretty solid underneath and the trans feels pretty good.
The PO fixed the rust by pop riveting on sheet metal and than putting bondo
over it (looks like he applied it with a popsicle stick ;-))It has been
sitting a while, but the engine compartment is clean and there is no rust
anywhere in or around the engine compartment. It comes with an extra motor
too! Since the only other bus that I have owned is a 78 I was wondering if
someone could give me some things to look at on this one.  Is there any
thing that makes this bus better than other years? Anything that I forgot
to check? The top is alittle ripped but nothing that can't be repaired.
Anyinfo would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
dave

BTW the price is reasonable
