&gt;TO: Mitch Delk &lt;msdelk_at_po8.pcmail.ingr_dot_com&gt;
&gt;I have a VW bus tent (came w/a 72 camper I think) Has been in basement
&gt;for years. Selling in garage sale this weekend if there is a taker.(dbout it)
&gt;If it does not sell, I will put it up for bids. I think everything is there.
&gt;Has tent, poles, netting. Looks big. Have not put it together. 
&gt;Am having yard sale so no time to deal with it.
