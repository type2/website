Subject: Re: Another Tire Q

In response to the numerous responses concerning my tire question, I have 
one additional question.

Will 215/70 14's fit ok on a Bus?  My '72 to be exact?  Would there be 
any wheel well clearances?  Or is 205/70 about as big as you can go?  
Would like to try some 215/70s from Goodyear (The Workhorse label) but 
would hate to have problems due to size.  

Thanks again!
