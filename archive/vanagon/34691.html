        I vaguely remember sleeping in this tent when I was about 11-12 ( =
mid-late 60s...)

        Is this like a Rarest of the Rare for Buses....??

Jon, Jon, Jon...
This is called a poptop, and the bus is a camper.  Westfalia, or something
similar if made by a different company.
I have a 79 Westy that looks similar(baywindow vs split) that has the same
top facing the other way.  The other tent, the one not on top was a VW option
that people pay good money these days to acquire(unless the seller does not
know what he/she has)


BTW, if someone has one of those nasty contraptions that hang off the side
of the body, I would be happy to give you a few dollars to part with it ;-)

Cheers,
