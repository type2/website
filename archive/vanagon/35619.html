&gt; Gadzooks!  A gas, I mean diesel, heater?  Can it be?  I guess the heater

&gt; feeding?  The PO told me the heater worked but that the heater fan was
&gt; toast.  Real shocker, I know.

No you should have a heater core also. Look for two hoses going up
under the dash. They are located a little to the right of the middle
of the bus. The heater core and the fan is difficult to access.
You have to take off the dash to get in there. It took me several
hours to change the fan. 

Actually, you probably have two fans, one in the diesel auxillary
heater, and one under the dash. Even if the under-the-dash fan is
broken you might be able to get some heat by using the auxillary
heater alone. Do you have the Bentley manual for the diesel vanagon? If not
I can copy the diesel heater section for you.

I don't have the diesel auxillary heater, but living in Rochester, NY
I often wish that I did. Once the engine is warm the heater output is
sufficient to heat the interior, but starting from around -10F or
lower it often takes 3-5 miles for the engine to heat up. 

Does the aux heater feed through the heater core? In my bus I can see where the
hot air duct is supposed to come through the sheet metal, but the hole
is welded shut. It looks as though the duct is supposed to go right 
up to the black plastic box containing the heater core, fan and
heat control flaps. If the aux heater indeed feeds through the heater
core it could be used to heat the engine quicker to reduce wear
and fuel consumption. With an extra coolant circulation pump the engine
could also be heated before starting.
