Todd,
I had the exact same problem about 8 yrs ago while trying to remove mine.
It seems that with age, the sides of the fridge stick to the sides of the
cabinet. I didn't see you mention the 2 screws on each side being removed,
however, if they were and you still can't get it out, try sliding something
VERY thin between the fridge and the cabinet. This worked for me and
afterwards I sprayed silicon lube on the surfaces to keep it from happening
again. Good Luck,
Bob Bellanca

&gt; My fridge is stuck!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Not wanting to be left out, I decided to pull my fridge and see why it
will
&gt; not work on propane, and why the fan I hear about never seems to run. But
my
&gt; plans were foiled when I discovered I can't get the fridge out of the
&gt; cabinent. Yes, all gas and electric lines are free, the door and trim
panel
&gt; removed, and the vent removed from the side of the van. The fridge
refuses to
&gt; budge in any direction. Up, left, right, forward.
&gt;
&gt; Any tips from the Domestic 182B sages out there?
&gt; I was thinking that plastic explosives might help....&lt;g&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
