Subject:  Type III trailing arm???

HELP!!!!  I'm trying to lower the front end of my ' 70 Squareback and am
having trouble loosening the right side lower trailing arm from the splines
that hold it in.  I've tried pullers, heat, air hammers, crowbars, liquid
wrench, and nothing seems to break it free.  I'm pretty sure that there is
some rust keeping it from moving but this is getting ridiculous. The last
puller I tried I  tightened it with a lot of torque, I measured it with a
torque wrench and it was 120 ft/lbs!!!!  Any help that anyone can give me
will be greatly appreciated!!!  Thanks.
