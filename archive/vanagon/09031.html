Carl,

I once used the wrong spec spark plug in an aluminum block motorcycle and 
literally burned a hole through the top of a piston.

If the plug you mention is longer than the others, as you suggest, you 
might want to double check that it is a spec plug.  If not, you might 
want to ask the person who put it in to pay for your overhaul (assuming 
that it was not, as in my case, the guilty party at the keyboard &lt;g&gt;).
