&quot;Guzzling various tasty brews and enjoying
the great outdoors to undreamed of heights....&quot;

Hey, Steve, we would be remiss here not to mention the meltdown of
the beer bottles.  I think I have some footage of &quot;the morning
after&quot;, from Friday nite's binge.  Some of you turkeys were &quot;seriously
blitzed.&quot;  Anyway, some geek had the idea it would be fun to
get the pitfire roaring to new heights, and decided to see if
they could melt glass.  Unfortunately, I missed this firsthand,
as I was busy for over 2 hours trying to take a shower, but the
results confirmed that you guys are all out to lunch.:)

At one point, I had 7 people total partying in my van, whle
I slept in the back well behind the rear seat.  


Ah.  What a trip!
