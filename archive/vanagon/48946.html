So Tim Smith says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;jim_at_atcweb.atc.1dc_dot_com &gt; will no longer work after Saturday. I will
&gt; &gt;officially unsub from this the vanagon and type2 mail lists as of 17:00
&gt; 
&gt; Just couldn't go cold turkey could you?  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Quick, where's the support group number!? Ah ha.. 1-800-van-agon, whew,
&gt; saved. &quot;I am an addict and my name is Rusty, help me&quot;  :) 

(in a wimpy-sniveling voice) Yesth... we can help you.  Our rates are
$10.00 for the first hour and then $5.95 every hour after that....  How
will you be paying?  Visa, Master Card or American Exthress?....
