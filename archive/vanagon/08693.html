&gt;I'm not sure I'd want ALL of the bus owners on this list.  Hell, it's hard
&gt;enough to get through it if you don't read it for a weekend or so.  Like

well, yeah, you're right. but it was a pretty neat thought. :)

&gt;Okay Joel, you get the goats and I'll bring the chickens... ;P

nope. not me. *I*'ll get the chickens. my old man barbecued my pet goat when
i was very young. :(  &lt;never did forgive the old bastard for that!!&gt; and i
really hate chickens: every morning, before i trudged five miles, uphill, in
the snow and mud, to school, i had to go 'slop the chickens'. no lie. 3,000
layers. chickens are filthy, disgusting animals that have no redeeming
virtues whatsoever ... except that they fry up nice for supper. so i eat
eggs of all shapes, sizes, flavors, and forms; i eat chicken in any receipe
found ... cause every egg, and every chicken dish means ONE MORE DEAD CHICKEN!
:)  &lt;sorry. got carried away a little there&gt;

&gt;Anyway, I thought that the FAQ list and the growing WWW/gopher stuff was
&gt;turning into the Next Generation Idiot Guide already.  Not to mention
&gt;this list. The online Idiot Guide for newer VWs of the 80's and 90's.

yeah, but not everybody has access to computers and internet and such.
i don't have any access to WWW stuff at all.

&gt;By the year 2000 will be starting the virtual reality idiot guide where we
&gt;are actually shown how to fix any part of are VW's.  Wow! Cool!  Ric could
&gt;literally show me how to undercoat the pan.

hmmmmm. hadn't thought about multi-media Idiot's Guide (does that mean a
Guide for multi-media Idiots? or a multi-media Guide for ordinary Idiots? :)

&gt;Martha could display her flannel wardrobe.

Victoria's Gossip? :)

&gt;Joel could walk us through a virtual library of VW goodies and  showing
&gt;us how to prepare grits in the highest Alabama fashion.

ha! grits. only good for stuffing dead chickens.
