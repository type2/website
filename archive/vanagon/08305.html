Subject: Smog pump wanted
Date: Fri, 16 Dec 94 12:22:01 PST

  Does anyone out there in breadloaf land have an extra or discarded smog pump
  they would be willing to sell me? Mine has developed a death rattle, I fear
  it's days are numbered and I have travel plans for right after Christmas.

  Thanks and gratitude in advance,
