Subject: RE: JC Witney liftgate struts for vanagon 


I noticed the same ad in the recent JC Whipme catalog, just after I 
phone-ordered a pair from Marin Motorsports (ad posted here by Joel 
a couple weeks ago). Mine arrived early this week ($29ea) and while 
not identical to the originals, appear to be made by the same German 
company. It took all of 5 minutes each to install 'em, and they work 
fine. It sure is nice not to have to duck when loading/unloading the 
back of the van...but I find I still do, without thinking, after two 
years of living with the incredible sinking hatch.

BTW if you do order the Whitney struts, let us know how they match 
up to the OEM version. I'm just curious to know if I got anything 
for my extra 18 bucks!
