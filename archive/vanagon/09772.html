Subject: [A] Camper woes

Hi all. We recently did a ring job and replaced the heads on my sister's

Camper's 1700 cc (type IV) engine. It has a 2bbl Weber carb on it, and

did run OK, despite having terrible compression on the cylinder 3/4 side.

After putting everything back together, we are unable to start the van.

There is good spark at the plugs, and it will start with starting fluid

and run for a few seconds (until the fluid burns off), but it never seems

to be getting any fuel.

This wouldseem (to me) to be a problem with the carb, but it was working

fine before the engine rebuild. There is fuel getting to the carb ...

 Any ideas anyone?
