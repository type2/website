Subject: Re: Air conditioning...in a 78 Westy? huh?


&gt;Though I'm not an expert, I didn't think they offred A/C on pre-Vanagon 
&gt;Westys.  Zowee!  I'll have to take a look next time I see my 79.
&gt;Chris &quot;the Ontario-an&quot;
&gt;79 Westy

I've seen A/C units in buses back to 1972.  The units placement have
been in 3 areas.

#1.	In passenger buses: above the front seats.

#2.	In campers: behind the front seats.

#3.	In both passenger buses &amp; campers: below the the entire length 
	of the dash.

These were both factory options and dealer options.
