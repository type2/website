Subject: Re: Speaking of heater fans...

&gt;....does anyone have any experience with the fan that fits
&gt;in the tube from the back to the front which is supposed to
&gt;help get heat in to the poor little bus (pre-80)? I know you
&gt;people in the temperate zones (read cold) don't care, since 
&gt;the darn thing needs heat to begin with, but you people in
&gt;the sub-tropics (AZ, SoCal, AL, NSW???) -- have you had 
&gt;any contact or thoughts on this?

Todd- I saw one of these on a 73 bus.  It was a in-line jobbie, a squirrel 
cage with a hose on each end.  Might want to check at a junkyard.
Hope that helps
