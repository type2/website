Barndoor fans:

	I have started a barndoor page!  Check it out, and if you have
any pics handy you'd like to add, or any trivia you think should go in
it, let me know!  Here it is:

ftp://ftp_dot_netcom_dot_com/pub/tf/tfab/barndoor.html

	I've also spruced up the rest of my web pages, and added more
pictures.  Looks like I'm gonna have to move to a provider with a more 
generous disk quota!  (and a _real_ web server...)  I have a couple meg
of bus jpegs now...

Thom
