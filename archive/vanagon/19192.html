Subject: Is owning a van probable cause? (fwd)
Date: Thu, 15 Jun 95 19:53:11 EDT

&gt; I'm planning on driving my '77 non-hippie, normal colored, van from here
&gt; in Lubbock to Tacoma WA for school.  What are you all's experiences with
&gt; getting stopped/harassed by police for driving a van?  Being an 18 year
&gt; 
Well, the only time I was ever stopped in my, non-hippie, normal
colored '76, (african red/pastel white, VW's best red ever) was
late at night while weaving back and forth trying to drive with
one hand and wipe a big enough hole to see through the windshield
with the other, being the day after New Years, and 1:00 am I figure
it was reasonable they thought I was drunk.  Yes sir officer, I'll
just sit here a few minutes and let her warm up before I continue
(yeah warm up, right).  I don't really think they have the image
they once did folks.  Oh, and I'm only going on the ripe old age
of 26.
