Subject: Lower Temp Thermostat

RE: request for part number of lower temp thermostat

I *think* but do not know for sure that the lower temperature thermostat I
have in my van is that sold by Neuspeed (1-800-423-3623) with a part number
of 20-8.170.03 (3 pole model) which turns on the radiator fan at 180 degrees
vs 197 stock. There is also a 2 pole model which I am not sure might be only
for vans without a/c. It is possible these thermostats won't fit. It is
possible that Neuspeed, which sells these things for VW watercooled sedans,
etc., will disclaime all knowledge of whether they fit the Vanagon.
