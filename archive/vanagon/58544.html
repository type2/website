Subject: Portland area vw stuff...

I see that some of you are from the Portland, OR area. My question for you
is in regards to VW clubs/enthusiast activities in the area. I am a Senior
in college at WSU and just landed a job down there, so I was just wondering
who to contact when I get down there.

Thanks for any info you can give!!!
