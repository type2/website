Subject: &lt;syncro&gt; Tierra del Fuego 2000 Trip

Hi,

I've emailed a couple who've driven the Darrien Gap from Panama to
Columbia several times.  They have a $12 'book' on the trip, details GPS
coordinates for trails etc.  Assured me it was passable in 4x4, and I
described the Syncro realistically (small tires/clearance/fording).

They've most recently done it on a 2x2 Rokon Trailbreaker
motorbike.Prime advice was that a powerful winch is the main
requirement. And the ability to carry sufficient fuel, as mostly only
pre-mix (oil+gas for outboards) is available nearby.  Gas runs $4/gal
and up. Trailer and two 45 gal drums may be feasible, up to the start of
trail work.

So...  How many Syncro pilots feel like going through this stage and
meeting up with the rest of the tour following the ferry to Cartagenia?  
This kind of expedition requires some leg work, sponsorship from 4x4
equipment suppliers and some promotional hype for cash/travel help.
Doubtful that VW would give a rats ass, maybe Steyr would help? A few
spare VCs would go over well. Good promotion for offroad tire company,
winch/recovery gear supplier.  Friend of mine has mounted several
successful ski trips to Chile/Peru this way, makes his living off the
films taken. Skateboarding the highest road in the world was not a
success however!

I figure 3-4 vehicles would allow a decent chance at this, but not
without a lot of gut busting work.  Not for the faint of heart or those
with time constraints.  (100kms _at_ 2-&gt;?? kms/day) != fun.  Any other
lunatics besides me considering this route?  Now you know why I wanted
the front locking diff, and the dual 2&quot; receivers I've installed at each
end of my Syncro.

I do have some concerns about ecological scars following such a trip.
I've seen what happens when others have followed me down some
grassy/muddy trails in conventional 4x4s.  The Syncro does tread
lightly, due to equal weight distribution and the drive system wheelspin
is minimal.  And I don't feel 3-4 vehicles would constitute the tip of
the iceberg.  Not likely we'd start a rush. Things heal quickly if
erosion is kept away, back walking the ruts in really helps control
water flow.  Please don't make this a list topic, flame me directly as
inclined.

Anyway .. I'll be waiting you all down there ... ;-)

And don't forget, we're expected for dinner :).
