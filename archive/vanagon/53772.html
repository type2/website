&gt; P.S. I have attached a small but strong magnet to my drain plug to
&gt; capture any metal wear.

Radio Shack sells two little bitty magnets (3/16&quot; dia., 1/16&quot; thick) for 
about $2.  These are *really* strong, and make excellent drain plug magnets.
I super-glue mine on, ro drill a shallow hole and inset them.  A cheap bit
to add to your bus.
