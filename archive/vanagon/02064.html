Subject: Re: Canadian Westy = DOT/EPA OK?

Paul, my experience has been in going the other way, bringing a California 
model into Canada, which came  in without a hitch (it was an 82 
Westfalia). On the other hand BC pollution laws are not as stringent as 
say California's (or wherever you live) so this will be the main sticking 
point (check for CAT, O2sensor and EGR valve). The other 
issue is duty, I believe you will pay higher duty (possibly 9% since the 
vehicle is neither US or Canadian made (free trade lives!) but you should 
pass the bumper laws because Canada has more stringent laws on that one 
(an NTB?). The vehicle will also be in good shape  no slat in BC but-make 
sure it has been 
safetied before purchase; this will ensure that you aren't caught doing 
any major mechanical work yourself. Regards - DC

&gt; My search for a Westphalia Syncro continues, and Joel has suggested that I
&gt; might get a better deal north of the border in Canada (specifically the
&gt; Vancouver area). I've checked out most of the issues involved in doing so,
&gt; and it appears to be no big deal, except for one item. So before I start
&gt; making a bunch of long distance phone calls, does anyone know if ANY 89-91
&gt; Westphalias sold in Canada meet US EPA &amp; DOT requirements?
&gt; 
&gt; I called VWoA customer service, but they need to know a specific VIN before
&gt; they can tell me anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
