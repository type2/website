Sorry to clutter the list with this reply, but I can't reach Tom direct.

&gt;How much does the boat weigh?

The boat is not large.  It's an older Dorset fiberglass 14.5 ft runabout,
outfitted for Scuba diving, with 50 hp Johnson outboard.  I believe it is
under 2000 lb. towing weight.  But, I am thinking ahead to the C-Dory I'd
really like to have for serious fishin.  Thanks for the reply and advice.
