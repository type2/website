I installed Bilstein shocks about six months ago and the ride has
never been better...it was a real and noticable improvement. Now I
need to replace the rear springs tho....fortunately I found a shop
that will manufacture them for two hundred a pair...much better than
the dealer's 319.00 a piece that I thought was going to be the only
option. The only drawback is that I will have to be without the bus
for two weeks. Go with the Bilsteins, they are alittle more expensive but
worth it.
Cheers,
Rick
