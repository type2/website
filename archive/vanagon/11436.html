Subject: [f] Friday poem, Help me!!!

HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP  --  HELP

Please PITCH IN and help me with this!  Contribute your own couplet (for
those of you who slept through English class, two lines that rhyme) and
maybe we can get Joel to be sweet and collect them all into one big
beautiful paean.  Joel?

   I think that I shall never scan
   A poem lovely as a van--
   A Volksy van that gets me there,
   And home again without a care.
