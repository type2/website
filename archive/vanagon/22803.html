&gt;Allen, 
&gt;Is there still a gathering planned for Hatteras this fall (creeping up upon us)
&gt;?   I'm interested.....

Christian,

I thought I would reply to your message as Allen can't seem to get
our sys admin to fix his email.  Yes a group of bus people/surfers
are going to be in Cape Hatteras September 4-10.  We are going to
go to BBTA in St. Louis September 1-3 then on to Hatteras.  Final
details to be worked out in the next week.  Look forward to meeting
you if you can make it.

How about the rest of you?  Anyone else interested?

Dave
