That is incorrect, I have seen numerous EARLY '81's - even a april '81, with
no plastic air intake grilles - still had the bus-like metal fins. I have
seen a November '81 with the plastic, so they must have changed it mid-year.
I guess August is VW's changeover year anyway - so It was probably changed in
August.
