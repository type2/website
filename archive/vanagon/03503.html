Ugh.  Rough.

It sounds to me like it's time to take a deep breath, 
grab a beer, and reflect.  

You obviously love NuBus to much to take her straight 
to the dump, so check things out--all the systems
other than the engine, I mean.  If the engine was
good, what would a similar VW cost?  Does it matter
what it would cost?  

Don't let your head decide--give your heart a vote 
too.  (OK, maybe your family as well...)

DON'T ACT TOO QUICKLY!
