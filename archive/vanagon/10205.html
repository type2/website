 va&gt; Michael Heron suggests:
 
 &gt; Pat, Joe ( and all other Westy manual owners):
 &gt; 
 &gt; why don't we pool our resources, and make copies of our manuals, and trade
 &gt; with each other. In my humble (as compared to Joel's) data summarizing
 &gt; skills I surmize the following manuals are currently owned by the following
 &gt; subscribers
 &gt; 
 &gt; Pat Walsh- 78' Westy manual
 &gt; Joe Clark- 68'-72' Westy Manual
 &gt; Michael Heron- 1967 Westy Manual (approx. 40 pages tres detailed)
 &gt; 
 &gt; i like seeing Westy manuals from all years :):)

I for one would love to get a copy of the Eberspacher BA6 manual (gas heater).
I've got the mondo big green monster (about 2&quot; thick) VW manual for 80-89
Vans.  Don't think it would be cost effective to copy and mail, but I'd be
glad to make copies of certain sections.
