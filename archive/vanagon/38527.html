Subject: Re: Advice needed on '74 Custom Safare


Hello folks,

I spoke with the owner of the '74 Custom Safare today, and here
are a few more details:

- The bus is an original Safare high-top, includes stove, fridge,
  and sink.
- Dave Schwarze asked about the serial number, it's 1087 (or close)
- Stock orange paint job.
- Repeats of no rust claims - &quot;original factory undercoating,
  you can tell because the seams are not undercoated - orange 
  paint shows through.&quot;
- Muffler may need work, makes a bit of noise
- Front brakes may need work, they grind a bit, although he
  thinks that it may just be because the bus has been sitting
  for some time
- Someone asked about the spare engine.  The story is that the 
  engine in the bus is the orignal, the spare was one that he
  got for free from another bus.  He rebuilt and re-installed
  the original so that the numbers matched; he is trying to 
  keep the bus as stock as possible.
- Same person asked about spare doors - they were pulled off of
  the same bus he got the free engine from.
- Body clean and straight, no bondo, one small ding.
- He has a number (read, yardful) of VW's that are in various
  states of restoration by him and his dad.  Mom put her foot 
  down, he likes to focus on Type III's, hence the bus goes.

I'm going to see it Saturday morning.  It still sounds too
good to be true, but we'll see then...

Any other comments/concerns/questions-I-should-ask are greatly
appreciated.

Feverishly studying Compleat's &quot;How to Buy A Volkswagen&quot; chapter...
