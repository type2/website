&gt;Please send me the name and phone number of the current owner, as these

Well, it definitely wasn't a barndoor. I was ignorant back then, but
not *that* ignorant-- it was a '66 vintage or so. Besides, the guy I
sold it to was a complete jerk (stole my hibachi) with whom I have
not kept up these many years.

Were the bolt patterns the same between 16&quot;-wheel barndoors, and regular
14&quot;-wheel splitties such as a '66? Maybe the guy *I* bought it from (got
it free, actually, sans engine) had the 16&quot; wheels sitting around and
didn't know what to do with them, so bolted them to this bus?

yes, the bolt pattern is the same as the 15&quot; and 14&quot; rims on buses through
'70.  and bugs through whenever it was.   My '54 came with 15&quot; bug rims.
   How many people have buses with the original rims on them?   My first
split, a '59, also came with 15&quot; bug rims, which all proceeded to go flat
within a couple months.  It handled SO much better when I put the tires off
my parts bus on it - 14&quot; rims with good radials, instead of cracked skinny
bug tires.  Probably was mix and matched glass belted and radials too, a big
no no.
