Subject: Re: losing power


Hi,

Sorry I didn't give enough information. The van was running quite smoothly,
just slugishly, no knocking or misfiring that I could feel or hear. Fuel 
consumption does not seem to have been affected but it's pretty hard to tell
because it was only about 50 km of a 1000km trip. Didn't see any smoke
in the back. Engine temperature gauge did not indicate unusual highs. The
van is running fine now as far as power is concerned. But I'm going on
a week long trip in a couple of weeks and I was hoping to have an idea
where to look in case it happened again. Could it have something to do
with fuel injection? Fuel filter? I could change the latter to be on
the safe side I guess..

Thanks,
Darie

&gt; The description is a bit to vague to guess at.  Was the van running smoothly
&gt; as it lost power?  Was it misfiring.  How was fuel consumption, any exhaust
&gt; smoke? Engine temperature?  Does the van roll readily in neutral?  How is it
&gt; running now? More data please!

&gt; &gt;there, after driving some 500 kms that day already. The van
&gt; &gt;started losing power. On flat road it wouldn't go past 60 km/h,
&gt; &gt;on an uphill, barely 40 km/h. The rpm's weren't going up either
&gt; &gt;so it's not the clutch slipping.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;after we let it sit all day and went to visit Paris, we were
&gt; &gt;able to drive 120 km/h again.
