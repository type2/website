Subject: Re Start/no start 86 - Upper screen repair

First, an apology to Sean, Joel and John for their help in trying to
diagnose my start no start problem. I misidentified the whirr noise, which,
due to the lack of audio facilities, was determined to be the dread starter
whirr. As I read you help messages guys, I realized that, I don't think is
the problem. The starter is engaging, just no fire. I pulled my cap and
rotor did the old file them down a bit and seems okay now. The plug wires
have &quot;white spots and corrosion&quot;(Bentley manual) and those may be the
problem. I will replace the cap rotor and check the coil.
  Thanks again.
        Now---- is there a way without removing the top on my 86 Westy to
replace the screen part? If not I will attempt to replace the whole banana.
Any ideas? Thanks for that.
        Finally, All of my dealings with list members and others in this
hobby have bee great. I hope that if someone is shorting or backing out of
a deal, they will spend a few moments reflecting on that. Hey, we're all in
this together - paraphrase of Red Green
