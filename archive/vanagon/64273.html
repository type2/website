&gt;Has no one replaced the rear speakers in their Westy?  I guess I

&gt;
&gt;Next question . . . Has anyone come up with a great place to put a
&gt;CD changer in a Westy?  I was thinking in the cabinet, under the
&gt;sink.  Any other ideas?

Steven,

I mounted my 10 disc changer under the middle shelf, beneath the sink
cabinet. Works great; buy some flex-loom cable covering for the patch
cables and controller cable and it will keep the
wires protected and out of the way.

Also, in replacing the rear speakers I just used a large screwdriver and
hammer to punch through the factory pieces of crud and mounted some nice
Polk speakers of the same size that fit perfectly.  You end up mutilating
the stock speakers, but save tons of time and headache as pulling down the
ceiling cabinet is a time-consuming job. The wiring is right there, you
just unplug the old (destroyed) ones and plug in the new.  Very easy. New
speakers back there make a world of difference-the ceiling box makes for a
good solid speaker enclosure.

Email me if you have any more questions.
