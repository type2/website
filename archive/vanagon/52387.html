Several people ahve asked me where to get the self vulcanizing tape
I used. David Raistrick in KC got quoted an unreasonable $60 for
a roll. I paid about $3 for my roll at a Clas Ohlson store in G\&quot;oteborg.
They also do mail order. Their web page is:
	http://www.clasohlson.se/
	http://www.aftenposten.no/web/clas_o/
The first one is in Swedish, the second is in Norweigian. I couldn't
find an English language page. Theu have a web on-line order form.
I ordered the catalogue.

The tape I use is:

Rotunda 2501
PIB self amalgamating tape
25mm x 10m (1 inch x 33ft)

Manufactured by:
Rotunda plc.
Holland Street
Deriton
Manchester M34 3GH
England

Clas Ohlson also sells the heated seat pads Martha has been talking
about:
230Kr about $32 for a thermostat (27-32 degrees celcius) controlled one.
cheaper for the non-thermostatic ones.

Martin's solution to cold seats: Strap half of a cheap insulating 
camping matress pad to the seat ($5-10 or get the same material
free as used packing material from a shipping terminal)
pad
