Subject:      Propane heater for under the rear seat

Hello all. As winter sets in here in the NW, I have been following the
propane heater discussions attentively.

It sounds like the heater people are talking about needs to be mounted
somewhere -- with the area behind the passenger seat being really the
only place with room. I would like to get a heater but I don't want to
sacrifice the seat provided by swiveling my passenger seat around.

I was thinking of a heater that would replace the mostly unused coolant
using heater under the passenger seat. Does anyone know of such a
heater?

Thanks much,

Scott Semyan
