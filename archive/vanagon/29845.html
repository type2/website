For Syncro owners amusement, I guess this one never won 'Car-of-the-Year'
(taken from the rec.4x4 group)

&gt;we had an 87 toyota 4x4 van, i learned to drive in it.
&gt;a couple of points:
&gt;the van seats 7 and holds much stuff, however, the rear seats suck
&gt;the ride is harsh, exspecially in the back, not much leg room.
&gt;the engine is a 4 cylinder, not enough torque for safe lane changes and 
&gt;tough on on ramps.
&gt;visibility is great from the front because you sit up high, however, its 
&gt;like looking down a bread box to the sides and to the rear.
&gt;without 4x4 engaged driving in the rain is down right dangerous.  the van 
&gt;is rear wheel drive and has little traction on wet roads.
&gt;the van tends to bouce over roads and feels unstable at high speeds.
&gt;shocks, tires, and parts in general are pricy
&gt;with window tint the van does look smooth.
&gt;look for dual heaters/ac, and overdrive.
&gt;good luck
&gt;i hated the van, but its the right vehicle for the right person

And my comments  &lt;not mine! TS&gt;

&gt;the van seats 7 and holds much stuff, however, the rear seats suck
I spent four hours in the back seat of a Toy 4x4 van and have no
complaints; while not perfect, I believe they are on par with rear
seats in general

&gt;the ride is harsh, exspecially in the back, not much leg room.
I have no recollection of this.

&gt;the engine is a 4 cylinder, not enough torque for safe lane changes and 
&gt;tough on on ramps.
That may be so with a tired motor or a heavy payload, however 'safe
lane changes' do not require all that much torque IMHO.  BTW, the van
I drove had an *inline six*, 5-speed, and OD.

&gt;visibility is great from the front because you sit up high, however, its 
&gt;like looking down a bread box to the sides and to the rear.
That would depend upon window placement, I believe

&gt;without 4x4 engaged driving in the rain is down right dangerous.  the van 
&gt;is rear wheel drive and has little traction on wet roads.
I noticed no such problems.  If the roads are slick, just put it into
4WD (thats why it is there! &lt;g&gt;)

&gt;the van tends to bouce over roads and feels unstable at high speeds.
I didn't nothce this on a six hour drive at 70 MPH, but the van *was*
loaded
