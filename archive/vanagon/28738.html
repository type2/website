Subject: Re: Odometer

&gt;Anyone know how to repair the odometer, mine doesn't work and the gas gauge
&gt;doesn't either.  Makes for an interesting trip.  If I need to replace the
&gt;speedometer how much is a new, used, overhauled one going to cost.  Does the
&gt;vanagon have a peculiar speedo or can it be replaced with one from another
&gt;type VW?  How difficult a job to drop the tank and replace fuel sending unit?
&gt;
&gt;Oil sending unit can leak oil.  Replaced mine and no more oil drips under the
&gt;van.
&gt;
Dear Pattie

I have a &quot;spare&quot; speedo that came out of a 80 Vanagon. Now I don't have any
real use for it because it won't fit our 87 Westy. I suspect it will fit
most early Vanagons. BTW does yours have a tachometer?. We are however
looking for a good glove box lock with a key that both fits and works &lt;g&gt;.
Would also like to have a new left wiper arm (with deflector).

Regarding your tank. It's not all that hard. Just common sense and
patience.... Make sure to disconnect ALL of the gas lines, return lines, and
all of the vent lines. You might want to also replace the rubber grommets
and &quot;O&quot; ring also. Lubricate the rubber parts with powdered graphite to
avoid binding. And start with an empty fuel tank!
