Wow!  My top speed of 90 was on a *steep* downhill of I-15, and only for
an instant.  At that rpm the motor sounded like it was about to fly
apart.  My top speed on level ground is about 78 mph.  How did you get
going that fast??  You must be running nitrous and using 275-80-14 tires!!
Or maybe you have teensy weensy little front wheels?  :) :)
