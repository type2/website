&gt;     The biggest concern though, is the oil pan on syncros.  Dry sumping is the
&gt;     obvious thing, and it is not difficult, however, you need a three
stage oil
&gt;     pump, run externally with a belt scheme, and the price of the pump
&gt;     is about $2000! Plus fabrication of the brackets, the new minimum
&gt;     volume oil pan, the pickups, the oil tank, the ss hose. Price
&gt;     advantage of the Audi or some of the v-6 alternatives is out the window!
&gt;     Mind you, these additional complication only holds for syncros, but that
&gt;     is what most interests me, and you, and several others on the list.

so those of us with 2wd vanagons are in luck? how much tilting is necessary?
