Subject:      re.:  list of things to bring



Steve Johnson writes concerning things to bring &quot;Duct Tape - Broken radiator
hose.&quot; This is not my problem, how about yours? Though I have held the bus
together at time with the silver wonder.

--Well I'm enjoying Meredith's new book on VW buses, thanks for the
recommendation. One problem though... my wife saw the blk&amp;wht checkered bus on
pg. 75 an insists that is what she wants. I about to do a body job but didn't
expect old Gus to have to wear check (guess its better that orange though,
eh?)

re.: the trip. Those of us with kids in school till May can't join up,
something to think about.

--and last, as to the the Westys that use to have beds up in the pop up,
apparently as they got older the beds began falling on those below. Defiantly
not a good idea for a regular bus.
