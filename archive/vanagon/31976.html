Subject: Fridge sight glass

An improvement in the flame viewing ability can be made by 
cleaning the glass window in the combustion chamber and polishing the 
interior end of the sight tube.  just rub the end of the sight tube vigorously 
on your jeans to clean and buff it.  

of course all this necessitates removing the fridge but you were 
going to get around to doing that anyway.
