&gt; Interesting to note that RMMW no longer sells GEX engines.

&gt; The pleasant lady on the phone at RMMW refused to say if there was a 
&gt; quality issue but did indicate that RMMW's philosophy regarding customer 
&gt; service and product warranty didn't quite jive with that of GEX.
&gt; 

Now *THAT* says alot about RMMW itself!  I visited them personally last 
summer and they really came across as nice people.  Heck, even a month 
ago I called every dealer in the mags looking for an AS21 case and the 
fella I talked to at RMMW actually went out to the warehouse and had the 
guy pull down ALL the cases and they found 1 left.  Now if that ain't 
breaking your back for a customer I don't know what is.  I know they are 
alittle high in price, but I have yet to get a defective item or one that 
I was displeased with.  It's all been good!
