&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My real question is whether I should replace the cable or tear apart  the 
&gt;&gt;speedometer.....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks!

Gerry:

The speedometer cable is like a gear with only four teeth and all 4 teeth 
engage with the other 4 in the speedometer simultaneously. Even with 3 teeth
gone it will still operate correctly. Check the teeth at all engaging
joints. If you can find all 4 teeth missing then it's the cable.

The cable is driven by the left front wheel. Check the center hole at the
axle cap. A circlip holds the cable at the hole. Make sure all 4 teeth are
present. The upper cable is $40 plus. Ouch!

The speedometer is magnetic induction driven. It is more likely that the 
induction is less efficient than when it was new. I believe that it is
adjustable. If you can find one (maybe from a wabbit) it is possible
you can find out how to adjust one without buying it.
