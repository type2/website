Subject: propane fill question
Date: Wed, 12 Feb 97 19:47:00 EST

Hey all,
Well, soon I'll get the propane tank on my '81 Westy filled.  

I want to make sure that I know the proper way to do it.  Here's how I
think it works, tell me if I'm right and correct me if I'm wrong.

1) make sure the on/off valve on the tank is off.

2) Remove the cap for the fill valve

3) Remove the cap for the teeny &quot;80% valve&quot; to the right of the fill
valve.  

4) Fill with propane until liquid comes out of the 80% valve.

5) Put the caps back on and pay the man.

Now, when you remove the cap for the 80% valve, does not gas come out?
I know there's a teeny bit of propane in there now (the valve installer
put some in to test for leaks).

I guess that's not a problem, but if it is let me know.  I want to make
sure that I know what's going on and I want to make sure that the guy
who fills it is doing it right.

Thanks in advance,
Sean
