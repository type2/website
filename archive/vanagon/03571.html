NuBus is still in Watertown. I was in NYC on biz. THEY (the &quot;bad&quot; people) 
used the time I was away to GANG UP ON ME.

My mom volunteered to forgive $4k in debt if I would buy a *Caravan*
(The thought is making me puke). This brought my wife, who was leaning
with the patriarch of the family (namely, Me), right over to the other
side. 

My Mom doesn't want the precious grandchildren to ride in the big-bad old
bus (Heck, they GAVE me the bus for pete's sake!)

Hoo boy. major damage control time...SPS hinted that it might be the
diesel fuel pump/injector. I have started putting that &quot;spin&quot; on the
damage. &quot;Yup, boy was *I* wrong. Just a Fuel Pump..No Problem...&quot;

p.s. Thanks to all for the kind words. I needed them!
