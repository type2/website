Larry wrote about possibly getting a &quot;Bad &quot; Rack and pinion?

  My experience has been that if you use the Factory Rebuilt racks (ZF Brand) that you 
rarely have a problem.  I've installed about 12-15 of the ZF racks in the last couple 
of years without a problem.

  We had a customer use a different rack (Installed while out of town) and that rack 
leaked within the first 2 months or so!

  I really like the way that the ZF rack is rebuilt, the seem to be the only company 
that &quot;Rebushes&quot; the rack too.

  I seem to be fortunate that I got about 15 of these racks recently, If anybody is in 
need of one I'm selling them for $450.00 and a $250.00 core.  P-mail me if you want a 
rack or need more info on ZF products. Power Steering PUMPS are availible from ZF too!
