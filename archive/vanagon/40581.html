Subject: Final Parts list and request for confirmation

To all who I have expressed interest in parts from the '79, the attached
list summarizes my understanding of who wants what.  Those items for which I
have received multiple requests have parenthetical numbers next to the
names, in order received.  

What I need now is confirmation that you are still interested, and can come
by on Sunday.  Upon receiving your confirmation, I will transmit directions.
If you would like me to mail the parts, and I have not indicated that I have
your address, please send it.

                               Steve Dolan

Footnotes:

* -   These parts are not shippable.  If not picked up Sunday, I will get 
      as many as possible back to my place to be held for pick-up.

** -  I have your addresses and will ship them. 

*** - There are two sliding doors. One is Blue/White, straight, and rust
free, though slightly scratched.  The other is Beige, straight, but rusty at
the bottom (multiple pinhole rust-throughs).  My intention is to strip the
Beige door for Paul and Rodney, and David gets the Blue/Whiteone intact.  If
those of you involved want to re-arrange this, let me know.
