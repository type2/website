Subject: Re: '71 rebuild questions


~~I'm doing pretty good on my rebuild; things were going
!!pretty smoothly, until last night.  I did the classic
_at__at_'drop the nut into the case' thing!  The engine is nearly
##complete, I'm adding the externals and tin.  The only opening
$$to the inside is where the fuel pump goes, and of course,
%%that's exactly where I dropped the nut!  Now, I can see the
^^darn thing resting on the distributer drive shaft, but on
&amp;&amp;either side it's a long drop to the depths of the case.
