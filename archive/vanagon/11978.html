Subject: 15&quot; wheels &amp; brake fluid leak


[sidebar - what a GREAT weekend in CA - zipped over to the coast for
two nights near Salt Point (~60 miles N. of SF) - clear, warm (70), BIG
stars, whales, wine, CSYN on the tapedeck, Kira the frisbee labrador on
the beach - it reminded us why we bought Cassie...we HIGHLY recommend
the Salt Point area]


[15&quot; wheel question]

We want to upgrade Cassie's appearance when we buy new tires in a few
months, so we're looking for after-market wheels. Tire Rack says they
have a wheel that will fit the Westy called the Borbet Type A - a nice
looking wheel. Only problem is it only comes in a R15 sizes. Tire Rack
says that an R15 tire can fit in the wheelwell of a Westy ok, etc.

Can anybody give me some guidelines/formulas to determine my options?
I understand that a larger wheel radius will/could affect the accuracy
of the speedo/odo, etc. - are there other issues? How can I tell what
tire will/won't fit? If the tire is too big, will it scrape the
wheelwell and/or limit my turning radius? Obviously, I need some help
understanding how to size a tire for a Westy. Any help is appreciated.


[brake fluid leak question]

Another thing came up during our trip - our Brake Warning light came on
when we were on the windy Highway 1. Luckily, I had Bentley with me, so
I learned a bit about the brake system, including the fact that the
brake fluid resevoir is under the instrumentation panal - German
engineering! So, yes, the fluid was low, but there was also a leak near
the brake pedal from what I believe is the (or one of?) master brake
cylinder - the leak is small, but noticable. Is this thing the master
cylinder? If so, does a leak usually mean a replace of the cylinder or
perhaps a loose screw and/or seal?

My plan is to buy certified VW brake fluid and top off until I fix the
leak - I believe this is safe as long as the leak doesn't worsen.
Plus, the Brake Warning light sensor is working and will tell me
when/if the fluid gets dangerously low, etc.


As always, I appreciate any help from the list - someday, I might be
able to provide answers for other people, but right now I'm in
learn-only mode...I could always offer advice in areas where I have
some degree of expertise - golf lessons, anyone?

Steve
