Subject: Re: Locking engine compartment latch?

these locking latches changed over the years (i.e. 66-79), although to the
uninitiated, they look quite similar. I happen to have purchased a few NOS
ones for a 71' van. Am unsure if it would fit your 76'. I know Rocky
Mountain Motorworks sells these. I believe the latch for your can would be
black plastic as opposed to the chrome on the older vans. You might try
buying one from a wrtecking yard and having it rekeyed at a locksmith.

&gt;Hi gang,
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone seen/made/bought a locking latch for the engine compartment
&gt;lid on bread loaves?  Everywhere I look, it's just an unlocked button
&gt;latch.  The mechanism appears to be significantly different (p &lt; 0.05)  :)
&gt;than the mechanism for the big rear lid into the passenger compartment, so a
&gt;simple swap is out, right?  This open engine compartment seems like a
&gt;security risk to me, leaving the engine open for tampering, and running a
&gt;risk of theft for the battery, tire chains, and other junk squirreled
&gt;away back there.
&gt;
&gt;What (if anything) have you folks in Netland done about this?  I'd feel
&gt;better not leaving my engine compartment unlocked.
