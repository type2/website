&gt; unfortunately i have the bare essential adventurewagen - only the high
&gt; roof and back foldout  bench.  you have seen perhaps the most
&gt; desirable vanagon i have ever heard of, IMHO. 

Me too.  I wallow back and forth between a synchro hi-top and an 82
diesel hi-top with a gas engine installed.  I saw a synchro hi-top for
sale on the side of the road in Alberta - should have stopped and looked
at it, even if I can't have it.  Waaaaaah!
