Subject:      Re: '86 GL tuning advise

I set the timing in my 1986 GL By ear, in a pinch. It ran great.
I forgot about it for 3 year. I don't feel this has done any
harm. As the matter of fact, It also ran much cooler! This may
effect the ability to idle properly.

&gt; I have done a complete tune up on my '86 GL. I found it difficult though to
&gt; determine the degree of timing advance using the methods described in my VW
&gt; mech's manual and here by list members. Using a timing light and adjusting the
&gt; pulley notch to what appears to 5degrees advanced of the block seem (2k RPM,
&gt; temp sensor disconnected) the van runs terrible. No power. with it advanced to
&gt; what appears to be 40-45 degrees advanced the van runs incredibly strong and
&gt; cool with no audible knock. In fact at this setting it is well short of where I
&gt; begin to hear knock under load.
&gt;
&gt; Facts:
&gt; 1. Van has 166K miles on it.
&gt; 2. I have been running 92CLC fuel just to insure against knock.
&gt; 3. My temp gauge indicates 1/8 inch below the diode after warm up(ie. 40min.
&gt; Dallas, TX commute in freeway traffic at 100F). My understanding is that running
&gt; hot is one of the danger signs of advanced timing settings. Is this true?
&gt;
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1. Can a knock be un-audible?
&gt; 2. What damage could be occurring when all seems fine.
&gt;
&gt; I wish to have my baby run fast *and* long!
&gt;
&gt; relative nubie, please advise of any offenses :)
