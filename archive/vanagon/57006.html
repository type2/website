Subject: Gas gage &amp; Air conditioning

   
Since buying my vanagon I have had constanct problems with my air
conditioning fuse going out and my gas gage not working. I have been told
that these are both related to a comuputer board. Is is a common problem and
why is it not covered by recall or my extended warranty. Any information
would helpful. I have a1993 Vanagon.
