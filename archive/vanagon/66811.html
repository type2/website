Subject:        Regulator source, Please

Hey,

        Who ever brought up the broken regulator on the propane tank, you
owe me!!!  Mine WAS fine, but now isn't.  I wonder if my bad luck was caught
like a virus?  Anyway, I need a source for a reasonably priced regulator.
Mail ordering is best for me.  Ideas?  Thanks

Eric
