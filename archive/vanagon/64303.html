&gt; Volks,
&gt; 87GL died today while driving under full electrical load: All lights,
&gt; radio and A/C full cold. Would not start immediately, but later would
&gt; and drove it home. Now foll items apparently out: A/C: headlights
&gt; (dashlights work)/.
&gt; Batt shows 12.48V when van off:
&gt; Batt shows 13.28V when van on.
&gt; Stereo and driving lights work, where to start.
&gt; Any tips appreciated
&gt; Regards
