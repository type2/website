Subject: RE: What next? ... GREMLINS STILL OCCUPY 80 CA VANAGON 

I had a problem like this twice:

	1.  The fuel tank was corroded and flakes where blocking the fuel intake.  When
	    the engine was off, the flakes would come loose and fall away from the intake.
	    Then it would start over after running for a while.

	2.  I frequented one gas station.  It turned out that they had dirty fuel because 
	    of a bad holding tank.  Fuel filter would clog after running for a week (about
	    4 hours).

Luckily, both of these cars had carburetors.  Hate to think what it would have done to fuel 
injectors!

You might want to look into these possibilities.

&gt;         My little problem continues... My van still shuts off after a
&gt;short time, usually less than 45 mins. It shuts off like I've turned the
&gt;key off-no misfires, sputters nothing it just shuts down, the alternator
&gt;lights doesn't even come on till the van comes to a complete stop.
&gt;        I've replaced most of the ignition components too many to list.
&gt;recently I finally replaced the fuel filter and it ran great (as usuall)
&gt;but after 45 miles it shut down again. BTW the filter was really clogged,
&gt;Ithink I'll replace it again. As always it started up after 1 hour
&gt;intermission.
&gt;        This weekend I'm going to remove the distributor and take a look at
&gt;the hall control unit wire that reside in the black plastic elbow and check
&gt;them out. I'm running out of ideas. since I've taken it to two vw shops(one
&gt;being the dealer! _at_#$%^%$##_at__at_!) and have gotten very different diagnosis.
&gt;        Are there any ideas ie. additional ground wires? exorcism etc.
&gt;All and any are appreciated.
