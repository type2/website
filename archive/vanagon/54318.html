Subject: Help! Flashing Temperature LED
Date: Tue, 14 Jan 1997 11:44:03 -0800

This morning it was colder than most (25°F). Starting my 88' Westy
(water-cooled) was no problem however the Temperature LED would not stop
flashing.

This was with the engine still cold.

I shut the engine and checked the fluid and the pump belt which both
checked fine. The temp gauge did not indicate that the engine was
overheating so I decided (since I was already late) to drive to work.
The entire way the Temp LED kept flashing although the engine was not
overheating.

When I got to work, I shut the engine, waited a minute and started the
engine again. This time the Temp LED stopped flashing.

Has anyone else experienced this problem? Could there be air in the cooling
system?

Help would be very much appreciated...
