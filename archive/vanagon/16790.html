&gt;seems that in New Jersey they have implemented a much stricter emissions 
&gt;test;  the kicker is that if you fail the inspection a second time
&gt;your car is essentially condemed!

I'm sure that for a finite amount of money you can find an understanding
mechanic. Have him check the emissions *unofficially*, for example. If
they are within lawful parameters, then you can ask for a complete
inspection. Else, vote with your feet and leave New Jersey. :)
