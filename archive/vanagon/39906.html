Well, I also forgot to mention the all-important pilot bearing.

Yes, it was toast. Looked dry as a bone, and those little needle bearings
inside, had a reddish sheen... something new in my experience. Didn't look
like rust exactly-- that's more reddish-brown. I'd say that little guy
got REAL hot a few times.

Also, the retaining edge (facing the tranny) was broken at one point, and
one of the needle bearings was missing. That might have happened when I
was trying to get the engine and tranny apart, by making them an offer
they couldn't refuse.

The pilot bearing wasn't jammed in place, or welded, or disintegrated,
though. Once the flywheel was off, the bearing came out with two firm
whacks with a hammer against the socket I was using as a punch press.
Time for a new one, obviously, and I will pack that sucker WELL with
moly grease before I put it in. Will also try to spin it on the end of
the tranny input shaft, to make sure there's no scoring, wear, etc.
The input shaft looked surprisingly good once I got the engine away
from it, but you can never be too sure...
