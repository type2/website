&gt; &gt;Anyone have any ideas why this seal continues to leak?
&gt; 
&gt; Seals need to 'weep' a bit to keep the edges lubed and working, but how much...?
&gt;  I can't guess either, but fluid making it to the ground instead of being 
&gt; soaked into the dirt on the tranny sounds like too much. Did you seat the 
&gt; seals well, no pinching/folds/cuts and tears? How long did this take you 
&gt; BTW, my '87 is leaking there also. TIA.    tim s.

I had this seal replaced by my mechanic. He is an extremely competent
mechanic and I trust his work completely. I think he charged me an hour's
worth of labor to do the job.

This seal has been replaced twice in the last two years. The fact that
it has been replaced twice is what causes me concern. I hope it is not
indicative of an imminent transmission failure.
