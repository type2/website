Hello All,

Last night, coming home I heard the &quot;sound&quot;.  I thought I was mistaken. 
Nope.  Oil is full on the stick and smells like oil-- no burned odor at
all.  I am merely a shadetree type but I Know the sound of a rod ready
to go.  

The point is that I bought a cheap rebuilt engine out of Canada.  I am
now paying for my decision.  Would love to keep my Syncro GL.

Can anyone on this list steer me to a competent engine person?  20k on
a  $3000.00 rebuilt is b.s. period.

Am kinda angry.  Promise to keep things down if anyone knows anything.

Lon T.
'86 Vanagon Syncro GL (used to be my pride and joy)
