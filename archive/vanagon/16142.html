Subject: Gas Tank Filler Neck Parts


    My '79 Bus has a smell of gasoline inside the van, especially it 
    when is filled right up with gas.  I have checked for leaks and 
    have finally found two:  1) The rubber piece that connects the 
    tank filler neck to the outside cap area, and 2) the rubber piece 
    of hose that connects the filler neck to the tank.  These are two 
    small leaks but they are likely causing the problem as there are 
    gas stains around the areas.
    
    I think that part # 2 above will be no problem to replace but my 
    parts outfit says that the rubber piece that joins the neck to the 
    outside cap area is no longer made.  Since it is split and leaks 
    fuel down inside when I fill up, I would like to replace it with a 
    new one .....or I am open to any other suggestions.  Who handles 
    this kind part and what cost if anyone does?
    
    Thanks in advance for any help that you can provide.
