Subject: Re: '90 GL: Want to add curtains


&gt;camper has.  I was appalled at how much material costs.  I needed 10
&gt;yards (to make double-thickness curtains) to cover all of my windows.
&gt;The nice material was all between $8 - $20 a yard.  Forget that!!!
&gt;You might have to look around a while unless you are willing to pay
&gt;over $100 for curtain material.

The previous owner of my camper made curtains by taking hand towels and 
cutting, hemming, and sewing one end of the folded over towel (about 1 
inch).  It took quite a few towels, but makes a nice, non-see thru curtain 
that insulates heat and cold well.  I suppose they could be gotten cheap at 
some discount store - I think that there are 2 on the sliding door, 2 on the 
back hatch, and 3 on the left side.
