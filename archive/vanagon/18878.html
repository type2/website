Thanks for everyone's comments, actually the silver solder
was not the problem but as someone told me the flux was.
I was working late at it last night and due to the time
I simply purchased some electronic grade silver solder
at Radio Snack, and since it had rosin flux, I figured
using activated rosin paste would be OK, it was not.  I
recalled using some before with an acid flux and upon
going to an auto parts store this morning and buying a
kit with liguid flux and solder for $5 experienced exceelent
results.  Thanks everyone who shared some insight, BTW the
spot welding idea is a valid possibilty to anyone who is
interested, I talked to a friend who used to tack thermocouples
onto steel in much the same manner, he used a big capacitor
and a wood pencil, sharpened on one end and bare on the other
for attachment of a lead as an electrode, worked well but the
thermocouples were very thin, like thick aluminum foil.
