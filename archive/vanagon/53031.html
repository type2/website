Subject: Re: 80 Vanagon Accelerator Cable Sticking

&gt; My acclerator cable is sticking when it is cold...Last year it never did
&gt; this (even at -30F).  This year it does it at any point below freezing...
&gt; 
&gt; How do I fix it? 

Hi Mark: It could be that one of the boots that protect the ends of the
cable have rotted or come off allowing water to enter the cable. When it
freezes the cable sticks. It is a fairly inexpensive and simple job to
change the cable.      Todd
