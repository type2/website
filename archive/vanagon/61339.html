Subject: Recent purchase...

Had a GREAT VW day yesterday....

	after a about a week of negotiations with a fellow in PA, a buddy and I
purchased a collection of VW toys thru e-page Classifieds...

	when the 4 boxes arrived yesterday we opened them with great
anticipation... The actuality surpassed our wildest expectations!!

	over a dozen major pieces in boxes, many unused and/or unassembled!

	The oldest toy is a &quot;made in Western Germany&quot; Tin diorama of a &quot;german&quot;
countryside with a service station in the middle of a 12&quot; x 18&quot; grooved
sheet... wind-up (very detailed) late 50s(Big window) Sunroof Beetle
drives around area guided by brass pin in grooves.

	Type II toys include 3 No #34 Splittie Campers (a low-rise roof w/amber
sunroof, a high-rise roof w/amber side windows and sunroof, and a lime
sherbert color flat roof with green tinted sunroof), a &quot;Bus Bomb&quot; model
(Caricature of Splittie Panel) and best of all 4 Plastic Barndoor
SingleCab construction vehicles (Dump truck, Wrecker, Cement truck and
Elevated platform truck)....

	Tons of Beetle stuff from '70s and early '80s...

	My buddy and I had a great time opening up and unwrapping all the
stuff... it was better than christmas!! because it was ALL VW!!

	125+ pieces in all...


	As today is my Day off and it supposed to Rain... I'll be going thru
the stuff today and inventorying everything to decide what to keep and
what to sell off at the Upcoming NHVW club Show...

	Tin diorama is already spoken for.... Type II toys are already added to
my personal collection	&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

	Take Care for today is Friday the 13th...
