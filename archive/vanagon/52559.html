&gt; and, for all i care, they can damn well take credit for the autostick!
&gt; which, btw, i dont think VW invented either..and, i doubt that the bus 
&gt; was the first small van, although i dont know my histroy of Euro and 
&gt; Asian cars too well..
&gt; 
I used to have a 1960 Mercedes 220S with an autostick.  It was actually
quite sophisticated (as you would expect from Daimler-Benz) with a fluidic
computer controlling the shift engagement points.  Mercedes called this
a four-speed on the column with an automatic clutch, but it was quite
similar to the later VW autostick, complete with a torque converter, etc.

I traded this Mercedes (with a blown engine) for my first VW bus -- a '57
singlecab with no third gear.  Good trade.  I drove that '57 for 20 years
daily.
