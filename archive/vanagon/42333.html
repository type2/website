Subject: (non-vw) Nash Metro help needed

If any of the Vanagon list members could assist me with sources of parts and
reference sources for Nash Metros please contact me privately.
Last evening I drove my *VW westy* down to a location where I helped my
brother-in -law purchase a '60 and a  '61 Metro! All I could see is somone
elses' Resto from Hell. =)
