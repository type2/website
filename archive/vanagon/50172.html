So John Brown says:
&gt; 
&gt; Someone on this thread mentioned a &quot;flue cover.&quot;  What are people using as
&gt; flue covers?  

That was me.  The standard ones that came with the van, fall apart from
getting too brittle in about a year.  The dealer wants $18 - $20 for 
them.  I've found an RV place in Sacramento that gets them for ~$5.
A while back, I ordered 25 of them and sold them at cost to several
members of this list.  If more are desired, I can order some more.
I was going to order more anyway.   I will require postage though
which is $3.  I was way short last time.
