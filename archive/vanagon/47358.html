&lt;&lt; 
 OOPS! Just broke the finger pull lever on the outside handle driver's door
(&quot;72
 Westy). Anybody got a handle? Condition of the chrome is unimportant; All I
need
 is the pull lever. 
 Alternately, anyone have experience with aftermarket items such as this? I
would
 consider a new one if I thought the quality would be at least as good as
what I
 have. 
 
 Thanks!

I have a used original in good condition for $18. Please E-mail if
interested.
Thanks,
Josh
