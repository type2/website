Subject: Re: Drivin' in Mean Wind

And there's a REALLY good reason they hate it.  I don't think the trucker
wants to be responsible for the mayhem that a blown retread causes when
it flies through your front windshield.

Tailgating trucks is a really BAD IDEA, don't do this.

Just look along the side of the Interstate some time at all the massive
chunks of rubber laying around and you'll know this is not an uncommon
occurence.

 &gt;    &gt; One trick to overcoming the mean head and side winds is to find a Big
 &gt;    &gt; 18 wheeler going the speed you want to go and tailgate him.
 &gt;    
 &gt;    In my more youthful days, I got a ticket for &quot;following too closely&quot;
 &gt;    for doing this particular action.
 &gt;    
 &gt;    I hear that the &quot;following too closely&quot; ticket is pretty hard to get.
 &gt;    I was driving a '71 at the time, and told the cop the truth, that I 
 &gt;    was trying to save some gas.  This happened in I-5 south of Mt. Vernon,
 &gt;    Washington, in 1982 (?).  Don't know if the cops are still so anal.
 &gt;
 &gt;uh, i learned this from my dad ('63 camper)
 &gt;and in my experience the truckers hate and
 &gt;will scrape you off somehow.  only once was
 &gt;it real meanness (last minute lane change around 
 &gt;construction).
 &gt;
 &gt;does work real well, though.
