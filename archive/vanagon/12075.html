&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;                         Direction of rotation is unimportant.  Also the cam
&gt;&gt;lobes have a constant radius over their back end (away from the raised part of the 
&gt;&gt;lobe used to actuate the valve).  This means that the valve lash reading will be constant
&gt;&gt;for about 90 degrees either side of TDC (crank rotation) for the cylinder being adjusted.

I had adjusted my (hydraulic) lifters for my 84 vanagon several times. 
I remember that if I turn the pulley 180 deg clockwise (from #1) to adjust
#2 it won't work. After looking at my bug engine's manual I realized that
I hade to turn the pulley counterclockwise. If what you said is true
then Bentley manual could have just said adjust #1 and #4 and turn pulley
180 deg then agjust #2 and #3. Well, this is just my point of view and
experience. You maybe right still. What do you net people think?
