Subject: 2nd Battery - Isolator Question

Just bought a 90 Syncro Westy (found on list).  It has a big deep cycle
marine battery as a 2nd and an Isolator to regulate charging.

Battery 1 is under driver seat
Isolator is under passenger seat
Battery 2 is in closet (currently powers stereo only -- but I would like to
get other accessories, etc on this one)

The Isolator sounds like a good idea -- but I am new to this and don't know.

I want the closet back and can put Battery 2 under bench seat -- but before I
do -- what do others do?

Thanks, James
90 Syncro Westy
