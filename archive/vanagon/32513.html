Subject: Installing Westy Interior, part I

hey now,

i'm gonna try to document the installation of the '71 Westy into my '74
Transporter, RuMbA. okay, soooo first the interior came from a '71 Westy
that looks like it's been in an accident. supprisingly, i haven't seen the
van in daylight but it looks like there is a big dent on the drivers side.

yesterday i got over to sean's shop and we looked over the interior. the bed
looked good, the table and chair were fine. the cabinet for the passenger rear
side was fine....the only problem was the ice box/sink. looks like there might
have been a leak on the fridge. decided to leave that out and wait for another
one that sean will have in a week or two.

now we got down to buisiness. took out the rear bench seat (anyone wanna buy it
from me? hint hint). first the floor bolts were taken out....this allowed the
seat itself to be takeng out. then we took the back rest out. here's a hint for
anyone doing a westy conversion: take out the metal thing that holds the seat
material BEFORE you try putting the rear cabinet in. you'll have to drill this
out because it's riveted in. we kinda got ahead of ourselves and had tried to
put the rear cabinet in without taking this out. duh!

okay...first things first. rear cabinet. it was evident that this wasn't going
to fit exactly right. if you ever get the chance, take a look at a '71 and a
'74. the '71's gas cap and intake pipe for gas is farther forwardthen a 74's!
this presented a little problem cuz the inside of the cabinet was curved for
the 71. so we had to cut and shape interior to fit this. no big deal, just took
some time. also, we had to shape the rear of cabinet a little so the rear door
would should. sanded a little corner down...looks very professional :-) also,
it will help if ya take the cover off the hinge of the rear door on the right
side.i have insulated curtains, so we left that on and just put the cabinet
over that. i'm going to do some work dividing the interior shelving...so stuff
won't slide around. it's a perfect fit now and it looks great.

next came getting the frame of the bed in. this fit exactly into where the seat
was. we had some thoughts and concerns on whether or not we would have to drill
and it turns out we did, and will. let me explain...the regular bench seat just
bolts to the floor. however, the westy bed attaches to the floor, the hump,
and the rear engine compartment. okay...we got the bed in which is a tight fit.
got it bolted to the wood frame..no big deal there. bolted it on the floor.
on the right side we had to drill two holes in the frame for the seat to attach
there. i believe it was two bolts. with this bolted we looked at the rear
mounts. sean's suggestion was to drill the holes and use sheet metal screws.
we'll do that later. looks like it will be way clear of the gas tank. for now
the bed is bolted solidly. i'm not going anywhere with this ice and salt so it
can wait. we tested the bed, comes out, goes back in. done with that!

okay, today i think we will get the jump seat in and possibly the table.
hopefully we won't have to drill for the jump seat but i think we might. in
about 2 weeks we'll put in the fridge. i think we might cut off the huge pipe
so as not to have to drill a hole that huge. i think it will work fine without
that. so we will just drill for the drain pipes. then mount the spare tire to
the front. also, i'm buying the westy's side windows. the roll out kind with
screens. i'm kinda concerned about that. will these '71 windows fit a '74?
what are some opinions on this? i like the idea of the screen windows. should
i put them in? oh, this reminds me that we still have to put the snaps in for
the mosquito netting for the rear door.

this whole process took us about 2 to 2 1/2 hours max. no real hassles, just
be prepared for tornados when ya think it's gonna be a breeze. i owe Richard
Palmer and Sean a big round of thanks and probably a couple rounds of beer.
interested guys?

i'm amazed at the space i have now. great storage, great utilization of
storage. i'm hooked. i had orginally planned on selling my van and buying a
westing but was convinced that with the excellent condition of my van this was
the way to go. i agree. oh man, then interior is beautiful. the only mistake
we did and it's repairable is put two holes in tn the head liner at the rear
of the bus. yikes! you'd have to see my head liner to understand. it's
immaculately beautiful.

i'm no mechanic but i'm learning. i think that's what having a vw is all about.
if anyone has any questions please let me know. i'll try to answer them the
best i can. hopefully this has been of help to some folks. i took pictures of
the process and i think we are gonna possibly have them on a website in the
near future.

till next time!
