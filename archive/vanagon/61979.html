&lt;&lt; Have you ever wanted to cover the cargo area in the back of your
 &gt;Westphalia,  above the mattress? I get uncomfortable when I park with
 &gt;something valuable sitting out in the open. I have the rear heater so under
 &gt;the seat storage is limited.

In my UK Caravelle/Transporter agent brochure for '88 there is a lockable
sliding vinyl cover in a track that covers the rear deck. It goes from the
top of the level of the back seat to the rear hatch.
