Subject: BRAKE for fun...

&gt;
&gt;but i would recommend REPLACING the brake fluid anyway, as soon as you can.
&gt;just for paranoia's sake. :) that way, you and your mechanic KNOW what's
&gt;in there, and that it is new and fresh. just a thought.

&lt;snivel, snivel&gt;  Yah, I *looked* (key word there, look, as I only
made sure that there weren't any leaks or anything--the brakes work
alright but as with any old vehicle (the Beast turned 20) one tends
to wonder...   So Joel, how do I REPLACE the brake fluid?  I have, as
I said, the 'bible' (note lower case my more religious comrades), 
Bentley, and Haynes.  Any anecdotal experiences appreciated as per
the usual coin...   With song praising and extolling your virtues,
natch.  --Ralf
