Subject: '65 project bus $450

Howdy there, I'm posting this for my friend Sean.
It's a '65 Standard bus, Sealing wax red &amp; grey, but the paint is rather
weathered.
Walk through (factory)
Body is solid,
good front and rear end
All the &quot;bits&quot; are there (speedo, lights, dash, handles, etc)

Needs:
engine,
brakes
windshields and 2 side windows
rear interior
paint

Anyway, for someone looking for a solid split on the East Coast to fix up, this
is a good one. He has Westy windows, if you wanted to make it a camper...
Please call Sean at 919-834-2800
He has another parts bus that I am posting separately, in case someone else
would want it.
