Subject: Circle The Great Lakes Tour

I'm about a month behind the planned pace for providing this information but, other 
than having to live with my damaged reputation, I've done all I can at this point.
I need some help to pass the word!!

I'm posting this &quot;status message&quot; on both the VANAGON and the THINGS list. Most of the 
respondents I had previously talked with were from these two lists. I would appreciate 
assistance from all of you to get the 'word' passed to a broader audience about the 
tour.

	the tour to Circle The Great Lakes IS ON AND IS A GO!!!

I have ... a definite route (generally as previously posted); a proposed sequence of 
things to do; a recommended list of places/things/events to see and I am researching 
places to stay at or near each location (list will include public camping, private 
campgrounds, &amp; hotels/motels).

The entire trip is planned for three weeks. Participants are invited to join or depart 
as their schedules will allow.

An issue I would like to get feedback about is WHEN to start the trip. (Participants 
are encouraged to respond).

I had been in contact with several, outside my family and dates were being discussed. 
Below are the options that had been 'sorta' narrowed ...

	There is a &quot;BUG Out&quot; in Springfield, MO with G.R.O.O.V.E.,
	a VW organization near and dear to my heart that will be held
	on the weekend of 14-15 JUN. I would like to attend that event
	then start from there towards Saint Louis then points northerly.

	There are some who wanted a bit of time after school ended to be at home.
	They wanted to start the trip from Saint Louis and points northerly in the
	subsequent weekend. 21-22 JUN (meeting/assembly 21 Jun, departing 22 JUN).

	A third significant proposal was to delay the entire trip until
	the August 2nd. There are social and civic events along
	the route that would be of interest using this time-frame.

As of this moment, I know of only myself anf two others who have committed 100%, to 
the trip; we are in agreement to start with the JUN 13-16 period. We have, however, 
all agreed that if there is a decent number desiring to participate on alternate 
date(s), we are willing to delay.

We need some feedback and commitment ... soon!!

After this, I will post a generalized scenario on the lists but will address to the 
individual participants, in detail.

Now ... the reason this has taken the curve as it is. ;-(

After my school's semester ended, our administrative staff 'decided' to switch over to 
Windows '95 and did a non-computer-professional's set of steps.

&quot;Murhpy&quot; was waiting for them all along the sequence!!!

Since I was spending so much time at school, I had transferred my information about 
the trip to a backup tape and took the material to load on my school/office computer.

I then 'learned' about the vast amount of fore-thought involved in this effort. 
Everything that probably could go wrong in the transfer between Windows 3.11 and 
Windows 95, did go wrong. As things started happening the working crew 'figured' ... 
perhaps they should backup the systems.

It seems they ran out of tape in the backup process.  By happenstance ... they found 
one more tape (on my desk) and used it to complete the backup process. (yes friends, 
the tape WAS MY BACKUP from home). It is at times/instances like this that my dearest 
tries to remind me that even 'thinking' about killing someone is a sin ....;-)

For my part in this mess, I was thinking I had the information on a backup tape so I 
began deleting stuff from my main disk.

I'm in the process of recovering as much as possible and will be back up in a week or 
two (I hope) and will be communicating again.

Please pass this as widely as possible.  Thanks.

Regards,
