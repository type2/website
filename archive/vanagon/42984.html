&gt;Style Regulator as it is a much improved unit.  I have maybe one or two Round
&gt;Regulators left in stock (price is $67.00)(and yes, it is no longer in
&gt;production because of current regulations deeming it to be unsafe as a
&gt;replacement,) and of course I stock the Square Regulator as well (price is
&gt;$86.80).  No modifications need to be made, the fittings mate right up.

This type of regulators are available in RV store near me for under $25Cdn. 
Made by same US company as makes the &quot;OEM&quot;. The square ones are obsoleted up 
here, NLA, and have moved on to a two stage type that is about 1.5&quot; longer 
than square type.  The copper pipes will give enough to fit.  No nice 
plastic box-cover however.  If anyone wants a box-cover the dealer has some 
left, $1.50 each.  
$87 indeed, harumph
