Subject: Restoration question.

All,

I have decided that it is time to take the Thing off the road and begin
a proper restoration of it (show quality, but I'll be damned if I chrome
any engine parts, and tow it anywhere). My question is this, I have
found some rust on the pan (whoa what a shock), is there a reason to
remove the body from the pan, or would that be overkill?

I will be doing a total rust proofing of the pan after I repair the
sections that need (you can do the Flinstone thing from the back seats).
The _at_#$_at_#%$!_at_#$#%$#_at_!!_at_$_at_#!_at_# PPO did an outstanding job of camoflauging
the rusting panels, and even painting over some rust so that it would
not appear until years later.

Also should I do anything special to the engine since it will be out
(storage wise)?

Cheers,

David
