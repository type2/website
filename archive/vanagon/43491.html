Subject: FS: propane tank for early Westfalia
Date: Mon, 3 Jun 1996 07:55:44 -0700

I was at a local wrecking yard this weekend and came across a propane tank 
for an early Westfalia. I'm not sure how early, but the style was different 
from any that I've seen. The tank was about 10&quot; in diameter and maybe 16&quot; 
tall with a flat base. Connections were on top of the tank. The tank looked 
to be in very good condition on the surface, but I didn't inspect it 
carefully. They wanted $100. If sincerely interested email me and I'll give 
you details about who to contact.
