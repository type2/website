Subject: Re: Need info on '88 Vanagon Syncro...

&gt;I have a buddy who is looking to buy an '88 syncro (65k miles, $10k).  


PDI pre-delivery inspection, make it a real good one, anything you miss 
that's bad/going bad will cost $$ to fix. Get professional AND experienced 
help. Experience in both Vanagons and Syncros ideally. If this is a 7 
seater, that price is way high, if it's a Westy grab it. IMHO!! That mileage 
is when bad things start to happen on all Vanagons. Check th exhaust. Check 
all drive components for torn rubber, oil leaks etc. Check the engine for 
H2O leaks. I kept mine on the dealers hoist for 1/2 hr, 'just looking'. Does 
it have the locking rear diff? A valuable US option that's broke on mine 
etc. etc. tim s.
