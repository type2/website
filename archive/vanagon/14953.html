Subject: Golf/Cabriolet owners only

Fool that I am, I've decided that owning a Vanagon is just not enough, and
am considering a purchase of a late '80s era Cabriolet (based on what I
want to spend, probably an '87, which would perfectly match my Westy
Syncro). For those of you who have lived with these cars, I'm wondering if
you could offer some advice as to what are the issues involved with them.

Are there years to avoid? Are there &quot;known problems&quot; with all years? What
needs to get special attention during an inspection? How many miles between
engines, clutches, trannys, should one expect? What are the costs of
rebuild, etc., etc., etc.?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

PLEASE REPLY DIRECTLY TO ME, NOT THE LIST!!
