Subject: Re: engine substitutions

&gt;
&gt;I have a catalog from Kennedy Engineering, and they suggest that there 
&gt;are a shitload of engine swaps one can make.  They say that the Subaru 
&gt;1800 engine is a terrific fit, and it is smooth and quiet.  Obviously 
&gt;some modifications would need to be attended to, but I have seriously 
&gt;thought of making the swap as soon as the stock 1600 grinder I have in my 
&gt;camper finally gives way.

I suspected this, since I had heard that Subaru based their engine on the VW
design.  Does it just bolt in?  What do you do about the water cooling?
