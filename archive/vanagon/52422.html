&gt;   I can't wait for time to go by and the stupid public has to pay
&gt;   $1200 to get there ABS system fixed. 
&gt; 
$1200? one reason I'm glad to unload the Corrado, try $1000 for the 
computer and $1200 for the accumulator.  Never a problem but always 
in constant fear.  In ABS's defense I drive fairly well and can 
modulate a stock system better than ABS except ABS can really save 
your ass when you get totally out on a totallly unexpected bit of 
loose stuff in a corner.  Still they are not coming because the 
insurance companies that are the true root behind all of this have 
decided that statisticallly they did not help, ABS increases your 
stopping distance as a rule, just allows you to stop, people were 
thinking they had &quot;super&quot; brakes and driving even more like idiots.

Oh and one last modern VW jibe, your average GM run o the mill ABS 
system for say my aunts '94 Olds if you need to replace would be 
under $500 and works quite smoothly, GM Saturn prices similar.  Again 
VW gouging $1500 for a ludicrously overengineered system that they 
did not really need and still charged extra for years after it 
appeared it would become a defacto standard.  Anyway no more ABS for 
me.

I'ts a sad world we live in.
