&gt; Subject:       Ignition wires 

&gt; I've been informed that a set of Bosch wires costs only 22 dollars.  I had
&gt; been told one person paid $80 and was quoted over the phone $138 I didn't
&gt; want everyone to think that I am that cheap that I won't spend $22 I guess I
&gt; have been groesly mis-informed.  Does anyone know what I would have gotten
&gt; for $138?
&gt; 
Ripped off? That sounds more like a dealer price!

Seriously, I haven't priced out Vanagon wires, but have always bought 
Bosch on Golfs &amp; Jettas and never paid more than $25 CDN... Likewise 
for other electrical/fuel stuff - Bosch is usually well priced and it 
lasts. ie: The Bosch starter and alternator on my Jetta are still 
going at 370k... (knock on wood...)
