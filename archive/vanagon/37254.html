To All You Kind Folks on the Vanagon List:


At the risk of asking another YAFAQ, my brother has requested I try to find
a remedy for the increasing presence of moisture and mold on the inside of
the roof to his '81 Westy.  We live in Vancouver, Canada, a very damp
climate, especially in winter.  Is there any way to control this problem?
Any recommended methods for removing existing mold?

I hope this isn't too common a question.  Despite all the flurry of messages
on Archives, I have been totally unsuccessful in accessing any of the sites
suggested.
