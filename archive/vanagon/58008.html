Jorgen, check if you will find the first somewhere right of the
rear gear while pushing down the shift lever. If you will find the
first follow the next paragraph:

Just behind the fuel tank there is a connection of two rods which
is the linkage between the front half and the rear half of the
shift rod. Loose the clamp and adjust to the right angle of both
halfs. If you don't have the procedure I may translate it into
english. It is like putting the gearbox into neutral by fingering
on itself. The lever have to be most out of the box, but not as
much as to switch into rear, just between 1st and 2nd.
In the front box of the shift rod (just above the spare wheel)
have to be adjusted the shift lever to a certain distance to the
right edge (this depends on the year of make of your car, on the '80
it's 19 mm). Then tight the clamp.

I did it two weeks ago on my '80 Vanagon and needed five tries
to fix it. What's about my gearbox table? Haven't heard about.

My Vanagon is sick.  :-(

When i select 1st gear i get 3rd gear and when i select 3rd gear i get
3rd gear. 2nd, 4th and reverse works ok.

Is it a linkage problem or is the gearbox broken ?

Can someone tell me how to adjust the gear selectionlinkage in a
&quot;propper&quot; way ?
