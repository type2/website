Subject: Best of All Possible Worlds

This is pretty off the wall.  I haven't listened to my CD of &quot;Candide&quot; since
joining this list last year but the land that is supposedly the &quot;best of all
possible worlds&quot; has &quot;Westphalia as the center.&quot;

Just thought you campers would like to know.
