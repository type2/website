&gt;I stopped by Sears today and found out that they make a Diehard Gel Marine
&gt;battery that is type 27, 12&quot;L x 6 13/16&quot;W x 9 7/16&quot;H.  Does anyone know if
&gt;this will fit under the drivers' seat in a 1990 Vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;Also, is a 'marine' battery the same as a 'deep-cycle' battery?

Ron,
My guess is that only a type 41 size battery is short enough to fit in the
battery compartment of the Vanagon.  Except...  I've just got a brochure on
the Optima battery and it appears that it will fit in there when lying on its
side.  This battery is supposed to be able to operate in any position - even
upside down.  I'll measure the compartment and post the answer tomarrow.  Be
warned though - they cost alot at $150.00 ea.
