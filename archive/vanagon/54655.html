&gt; Hi all.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm waiting for the weather to warm up so I can do some work on my van
&gt; (install used engine).  It's been too cold to start working outside ( -41
&gt; before wind chill (yes minus 41 degrees)).  I live in Northern Ontario
&gt; Canada.  40 below is 40 below celcius, farenheit, same thing.  It was only
&gt; a couple of days, but we usually get about a week of that stuff near the
&gt; end of January.
&gt; 
&gt; The first year I had my van (85 transporter), I was coming home from work
&gt; at about 5 am, 40 below and my oil light came on.  I pulled over to find my
&gt; oil all up my back door and in a puddle underneath.  Scared the heck out of
&gt; me but it ended up it was only the oil filter gasket had blown out.  Quick
&gt; change that afternoon and all was well.  I still had to walk home though (3
&gt; miles).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know what weight of oil is recommended when hell freezes over?
&gt; 
&gt; There was some talk of block heaters on the list a while back.  I couldn't
&gt; live without one.  My 74 transporter had one as well.  Every bug I ever
&gt; bought had one too.  They are actually &quot;oil heaters&quot; on the air cooled
&gt; ones, and the water cooled one is the same only bigger.  It basically is an
&gt; element in an aluminum block that bolts to the bottom of your motor and
&gt; keeps things toasty.
&gt; 
&gt; When I first got my water cooled it didn't have one (I bought the van in
&gt; Southern Ontario).  A cold snap set in and I was stranded.  To get to the
&gt; dealer to buy a block heater (an hour away) I had to use an old trick my
&gt; grandfather used to use when he worked in the bush.  When the skidders and
&gt; dozers wouldn't start, they would light a fire underneath.  Not so
&gt; dramatic, I filled an enamel pan with hot coals from the wood stove and
&gt; propped it up on boards until it was close enough to just warm my bottom
&gt; (my engine bottom ;~)  ).  After three hours and a bunch of refills, old
&gt; unfaithful sputtered to life.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought that this is maybe what caused my filter gasket to go, but almost
&gt; on the exact same day, one year later, and almost in the exact spot. . .
&gt; (play twilight zone music now)  it happened again.  It was later in the day
&gt; and I got a ride that time.  I was even using lighter oil.  How light can I
&gt; go at 40 below?
&gt; 
&gt; The next year the van was parked for January, and this year I'm replacing
&gt; the engine, so I don't have to worry, but we still have a couple of months
&gt; of winter left.  If anyone has cold weather experience with their vans or
&gt; any recommendations, let haul, I'ld like to hear from you.
&gt; 
&gt; And does Propex make an industrial size heater? Ha, kidding. My BA6 will
&gt; melt plastic (left a cassette by the floor vent).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

&gt; still looking at an 86 syncro
&gt; 
&gt; Does really cold weather affect VC operation in a Syncro?
&gt; Any other list members live in the North?

According to Bentley pg 17.8
-30C to -10C use 5W20 or 5W30
-20C to +15C use 10W30
-15C to +30C use 15W40 or 15W50
-10C to +30C use 20W40 or 20W50

I use 15W50 Mobil 1 year round. It started two days ago at -33C with a
warm booster battery and ran smoothly. Took 10 km to get temp needle to
the post and another 10km to get temp normal 1/2 way mark (over warning
light).
