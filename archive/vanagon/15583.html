Subject: Re: GEX Engines

I have not tried GEX because I never knew anything about.  So I ordered 
from MOFOCO, because I only heard that they had some nice stuff.  My 
short block came with the wrong sized studs for the heads and the oil 
pressure port was not tapped. They treated me like I had no clue what I 
was talking about.  My friend also placed and order, which they promply 
forgot about.  Next time, thanks to this list, I will try GEX.
