&gt;&gt; Nice drawing Lee :-) but you want the cold water going in at the bottom and  
&gt;&gt; out at the top. Wizard sell these things (complete with plans) so you  
&gt;&gt; wouldn't have to bother making your own, although the stainless steel is a  
&gt;&gt; nice idea. I think they are about 50 quid. You could use a low powered  
&gt;             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;  Andy, any chance of posting details on where to get these things?
&gt;
Wizard's address is 
497 Ipswich Road, 
Trading Estate, 
Slough, 
England, 
SL1 4EP
