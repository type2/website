Subject: Pros and Cons: Eurovan Camper, '95 &amp; '96

Hello there. I'm new to the list (as of yesterday), and I need some feedback.

I test drove a 96 Eurovan Camper last night and am seriously considering a
purchase within a week or so. As part of the pre-purchase research, I welcome
comments from current owners.

It would be my primary vehicle as well as my camper. I'm not a power demon, and
the V-4 seemed OK. (Though rumor has it that a V-6 is in the offing for later
this year.)

Price being flung about is $32K. This, of course, includes the Winnebago
conversion.

Are you happy with your Eurovan Campers?  Do they suffer from the electrical
problems that seems to have plagued earlier Eurovans (info from Consumer
Reports)? 

Your thoughts, please!

Signed,
(not a sniveling lurker!)
