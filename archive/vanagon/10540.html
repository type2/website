Subject: Re: Collapsing Desks (too much photocopied paper)

Joe:

you wanted someone to bug you about the westy manual, well here it is GET
TO IT !!! Sorry to shout, but you wanted a boot in the $%#_at_&amp;*!! didn't you?
Re the trade, sounds like a fine deal to me. What is your snail mail
address, I'd REALLY like to get these photocopied items off my desk. PLease
Joe Puuhleaase, send me your address and i'll mail you what i have..


michael&gt;Someone (sorry -- digest, you know) posted about the water-collecting
&gt;ability of the '68-up Westy tent roof.  Dintya know that was its
&gt;_purpose_, dude?  It's for desert camping. :-)
&gt;
&gt;I fully agree about spreading an extra tarp over the external frame -- but
&gt;make sure it's drum-tight!  My last trip to the Keys, I returned from an
&gt;evening of Duval Street bar hopping to a soggy post rain squall mess.
&gt;(Dude! Lost my buzz!) The rain collected _in_the_over-tarp_ until it
&gt;reached that magic 3-gallon (U.S. ;-) limit, then SPLOOSH.  Fortunately,
&gt;only a couple of those irreplaceable plastic snap-hooks broke (waaah!).
&gt;
&gt;(That was also the night my air mattress sprang a slow leak.  I cannot
&gt;adequately describe the feeling of one's behind almost imperceptibly, yet
&gt;inexorably, coming to rest on coral gravel.)
&gt;
&gt;IMHO, buy a plastic tarp that extends a foot or so down every side, then
&gt;tie it to the frame as necessary.  You'll have to figure a way to keep
&gt;the little pole pin-ends at the corners from poking holes in the tarp.  I
&gt;slid rubber tubing over them.
&gt;
&gt;It's also true that _untreated_ canvas will repel water unless you touch
&gt;it (don't DO dat!).  Thompson's makes a sealant I've used to waterproof
&gt;old VW canvas with no ill effects, too.  Whatever doesn't float yer air
&gt;mattress....

&gt;
&gt;PS Yes, I know, I have a parts catalog to copy...:-)

&gt;Tallahassee, Fla.                                      there's no feeling.
