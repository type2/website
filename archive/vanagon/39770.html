Subject: Re: Recording the Top of the World Tour- Photos

I've used Seattle and the results are fair, Kodak photo CD is still my 
preference but Seattle is a little cheaper and quicker to get back. My 
biggest gripe with Seattle is they use a proprietary compression 
routine and you must use thier software to convert. Most of the 
photos of the Vanagon on my home page that
 Richard Kurtz got were from Seattle, the 
interior shots were camcorder captures. For real quick results the 
video capture devices for a laptop would be ideal but you get lower 
resolution.
But Seattle is kewlest way to go!
&gt; 
&gt; I imagine everyone will take lots of pictures, and some of them may
&gt; eventually find there way onto the 'net.  Toward that end I've arranged to
&gt; have my film processed by the Seattle Film Works ( http://www.filmworks_dot_com )
&gt; who will also scan the images for an extra four bucks per roll (six for 36
&gt; exposure rolls).  Once scanned, the photos will be available, via passworded
&gt; accounts, directly from the Film Works computer or they will mail them,
&gt; compressed format, on a 3.5&quot; diskette.
&gt; 
 
&gt; I mention this because some of you might want to take advantage of the Film
&gt; Works lab and scanning.  I think you'll find their prices are competitive.
&gt;  I'm very satisfied with the quality of their lab work.  I'm waiting to see
&gt; how the scanning turns out.  The first roll will include some shots of the
&gt; Polys engine and various tools and equipment mentioned in earlier articles.
