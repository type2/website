Subject: What drive belts and goldfish have in common

          I guess it could be bad, but then I noticed that the belt 
          connected to the PS pump look be on inside out.  Does it matter 
          which way a belt is installed (sorry for the ignorance)?  The 
          other belts in plain view have the smooth side of the belt 
          pointed outward.  The belt connected to PS pump had the 'grove' 
          side pointed outward.  Is this sucker on inside out??
     
     As I (re)learned two weeks ago, &quot;belly up&quot; belts, like fish, are dead.
     
     Head to the parts (fish) store and buy a new one.
