Subject: different bus heights

	
I noticed something this morning about my two busses, they are different 
heights...I think...The 1970 appears to be just a bit taller then the 
1971, then again, maybe it is some weird optical illusion because the 
1970 has a blue roof and the 71 has a white roof, or maybe the blue one 
just has more air in it's tires...what ever the cause, I just thought It 
was kinda strange, and I would share...     Dallas
