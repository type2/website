&gt;Regarding Matt Rathke's dead odometer on his '73 Bus:
&gt;
&gt;I had a similar problem on the '82 Vanagon - both the regular and trip
&gt;odometers stopped working suddenly - no noises or other early warnings.
&gt;Speedometer was fine.
&gt;
&gt;Looked like a small nylon gear failed.
&gt;
&gt;Tried the local VW dealers for a replacement.  It is to laugh.
&gt;
&gt;Tried a local speedometer rebuild shop - he had tons of the gears - he
&gt;said it is a chronic problem with VW/Audi odometers.
&gt;
&gt;So, can I buy one?  Nope.  &quot;It would be a violation of the federal
&gt;odometer-tampering laws for me to sell you one, you obvious criminal type,
&gt;but _I_ can rebuild your odometer for you.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;So, he rebuilt it, for about $60 in 1988 dollars.  And it has worked
&gt;happily ever after.
&gt;

...sorry, I missed the beginning of this thread, but something similar
happened to my '78 Scirocco a while back at about 110,000 mi.  I took
the odometer apart myself and *carefully* applied some superglue to the
nylon gear (it had split so that it formed a 'c' instead of an 'o', an
thus no longer followed the odometer axle as it turned.)  That was 3
years and 40,000mi ago and no prob since.
