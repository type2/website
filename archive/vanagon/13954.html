Subject: Late Bus heater improvement.

    Here is a quick tip to improve that heater on late '70's
baywindows equipped with the factory electric booster
fan above the engine.  After trying everything else on my
'76, new boxes, rebuilt the rusty center distribution box,
rebuilt the rusty Y pipe in the back, sealed all joints with
good duct tape etc, I was still dismayed with the output.
Now the first problem I noticed was that the control cables to
the control flapper boxes had stretched beyond the point that
they would close the flapper, a common occurence, too cheap
to buy new cables or to have the hassle of installing them,
I came up with a nice solution.  Cut the old crimped end off the
cable then make yourself a new one by carefully drilling about
a 1/16&quot; hole in a 1&quot; long piece of 1/8&quot; brass round bar.  I used
a DREMEL tool to drill a hole about half an inch into the rod.
Then I mixed up some 5 minute epoxy put some in the hole with a
toothpick, skinned the plastic cover off the cut off cable for
about 1/2&quot; slipped the new brass end on and crimped with a good
pair of KLEIN TOOL wire connector crimpers, the epoxy made for
a nice seal to keep the cable from rusting under its plastic cover.
This shortened the cables and I readjusted for full closure when
heat was maxed, still unhappy I hit upon the best idea yet.
    You already have that electric fan in these cars (optional maybe
as well on early Vanagons) but it sucks all that cold air from the
engine compartment, 10-15 F air on a recent trip of mine. Looking
at those heater recirculation things for Bugs in the mags I figured,
hell BUS already has that just needs some ducting.  I carefully
hole sawed (I know I hurt the Bus but it didn't bleed much) a 2.5&quot;
hole on through the inside body panel back on the side behind
the black cover panel on the passenger side, opposite the spare tire.
I removed the vinyl covered panel first and sawed through the body
CAREFULLY as the gas tank vent tubes run up in there and you wouldn't
want to put a hole in one.  I sawed a hole in the vinyl covered masonite
panel then I ran some collapsible air ducting from the hole to the
intake on the front of the fan (most auto parts places sell a bunch of
sizes, get one that just fits on the fan) secured it with some silicone
sealer (black) and a cable tie to the fan, then slit it a bunch of times
so I could fold it over on the end inside the car and fastened it under
a little air grill from a boxer fan, made for a nice job and it really,
really helps, instead of heating 15 F outside air you reheat the
interior air, a big improvement.
