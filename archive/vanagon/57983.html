Subject: Hall generator causing rough idle

Hi Volks,

My 83.5 westy can't seem to shake a cause of the rough idles. I have
checked everything over. I was wondering if the hall generator could cause
rough idle if it was malfunctioning.The van runs fine when
driving/accelerating. There were some metal filings in the distributor when
I checked it and in the bentley it says this could cause damage to it. I
don't know what else to do. Thanks.

dave
