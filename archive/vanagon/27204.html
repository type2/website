Subject: Re: HELP: clutch/pilot bearing update

    hey now, Darie !
 There is a tool actually called &quot;pilot bearing puller&quot; that is really
useful in pulling all kinds of small bearings, not just pilot shafts...for
example. j.c.whitney has one in their catalogue for quite cheap. considering
its variety of uses probably a worthwhile investment...
   pull on,

&gt; Subject:    HELP: clutch/pilot bearing update

&gt;
&gt; Hi again folks!
&gt;
&gt; Took the day off Friday, started working at 7:30. Couldn't
&gt; get all the CV bolts off on one side but have a half-decent
&gt; opening between the trans and the engine to work through.
&gt; Got all the clutch parts out, up to the pilot bearing.
&gt; Given all the little bits that fell out, Tim was right,
&gt; the pilot bearing was likely the problem. Have all the
&gt; parts I need (new clutch disk pilot bearing, throwout
&gt; bearing), but can't get the g..d.. pilot bearing casing
&gt; out. Have now tried different suggested methods. The best
&gt; seemed to be to toggle a filed-down washer in on a bolt,
&gt; put a bar accross the flywheel, put a washer and a nut on
&gt; this side of the bar and screw in the nut. However, the
&gt; first 2 washers got bent out of shape. Found a stronger
&gt; washer, had to file it down for a while before it would
&gt; finally fit. Got it in TIGHT. Good. Got the nut on this
&gt; side of the bar, started torking. Thought it might be good
&gt; to tap the wrench with a hammer to give jolts rather than
&gt; a constant pull which seemed more likely to bend the washer
&gt; in the back. Eventually, just turned the wrench by hand.
&gt; Noticed after a while that we didn't seem to be getting
&gt; anywhere. i.e. I think the nut or the bolt is stripped.
&gt; Have tried sticking things on flywheel side of the bar
&gt; now and prying. Doesn't seem to be moving. Now.. Do we
&gt; need to take off the flywheel or WHAT?? I understand
&gt; the pilot bearing case is really hard to take out, but
&gt; there seem to be things in front of it which won't let it
&gt; go anywhere anyway. In my book these things are labelled
&gt; &quot;felt ring&quot; and &quot;distance ring&quot; (translated from German).
&gt; I've removed the felt ring by destroying it (I guess
&gt; I'll have to pick up a new one), but I don't know about
&gt; the other one. The exploded view of the clutch assembly
&gt; in the book shows the felt ring on the outside of the
&gt; flywheel, but the distance ring and the pilot bearing on
&gt; the inside, as if the flywheel had to be removed first.
&gt; Of course we've tried the nuts on the flywheel. Man,
&gt; they're on tight!
&gt;
&gt; By the way, I haven't found any bolts that required a 12-point
&gt; Hazett tool yet. Went in search of one Friday morning.
&gt; Found one after 2.5 hours. Took it home, tried it in the
&gt; CV bolts, didn't fit. Looked at them more closely. Turned
&gt; out they took a 6mm Allen key.. (or was it 8mm I don't
&gt; remember now) Maybe they've been changed before due to
&gt; the rarity of the tool. Anyhow, 2 of them can't even be
&gt; taken off with the vice grips. My husband puts the grips
&gt; on as tight as he can possibly make them and they just
&gt; turn on the bolt... Any suggestions as to what to do with
&gt; these bolts? The pilot bearing? Any substance that could
&gt; help loosen things anywhere (flywheel bolts, pilot bearing)?
&gt; For instance, would a little WD-40 in the center of the
&gt; flywheel help it? (Didn't try that yet, just thought of
&gt; it before I had to leave to catch the train to come to
&gt; work and write this e-mail!) If we have to torch out the
&gt; pilot bearing, how do you do it? Isn't is dangerous with
&gt; all this oil and stuff around? Also, unless we get the
&gt; bolts out on the right-side CV joint, we don't have a lot
&gt; of room to maneuver. (How do you &quot;drill&quot; bolts out?)
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for the hectic mess of a mail. I have to catch my
&gt; hubby on the next train. We'll drop by on the way home
&gt; in case anyone has responded, despite this being Sunday
&gt; and all. Thanks a million.
