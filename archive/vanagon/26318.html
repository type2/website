I just got my new sunroof cover.  I ordered it thru the local VW FLAPS,
(bugformance) rather than mail order.  Cost me $99 total, tax and all.  
The last one, ordered from another VW-LAPS (no F) who will remain(victory)
nameless cost me almost $130!!

This one is made by TMI, its Haartz (no fleas on this bus!) vinyl.  It
is much better quality than the last one (West Coast Metric)  The holes
for the clamp strip are already punched, and the side runner loops are
nylon webbing, not vinyl strips like the last one.  All in all it just
looks like more care was put into its creation.

Maybe this weekend I'll get a chance to install it...
