Subject: RE: Syncro on the Dunes

I will sheepishly admit to getting stuck on the dunes during a visit
to Ocracoke on the Outer Banks of NC.

We figured, &quot;Hey.. we have a Syncro, ain't no stopping us now!&quot;. The
waves and wind looked great so we thought we'd get a great sailing
session in. In fact, there were pickup trucks with camper attachments
on the beach! So we tried to drive onto the beach via one of the
designated access points.

We got about 25 feet into the soft stuff when the vanagon just sank
into the soft sand. We were pulled out by a guy with a 4wd pickup with
fat tires. He said he's pulled a lot of people out of the sand but we
were the first from RI.

I love being the first at anything :-).
