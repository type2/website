Subject: dealing with wierd noises...

(plagerized from the funnies - too appropriate to pass up)

How to deal with your VeeWee when it makes strange noises:

	step 1: ignore it; keep driving; assume it will go away:
	step 2: getting worse? - let it sit in the driveway and work out 
its' own problems (Jungian solution?)
	step 3: feeling brave? - open the hood.  Prod carefully.
	step 4: go to the dealer; shell out $500.

	(we treat our cars like we do our health?)
