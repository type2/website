Subject: EuroVan Accessories..or lack thereof


In my EV literature collection, I have a T4 Accessory catalogue from
Norway. There is a lot of neat stuff in it. For example, there
is a console organizer which fits into the depression in the dash
above the glove box, and a console which mounts on the floor forward
of the shift lever. These are two which come to mind...if there is any
interest, I could post more when I get home and look at the catalogue.

Anyway, to the point. I'll be in France (Switzerland, Germany, etc)
for the month of January and will be scouting out accessories from the
local VW dealers...perhaps we could make arangements for me to pick
stuff up.

One of the things I want to get is a rear fog light which fits into
the corner of the back bumper. Last time we were in Europe we rented
a T4 Caravelle which had the rear fog light. This time we also 
are renting another Caravelle. Our last one was white like our
EV here...I'm thinking about being just a bit &quot;sleazy&quot; and taking
the corner piece from our bumper...bringing it to France...and then
the night before we turn in our van, take off the corner piece with
the fog light, and put ours on! Assuming of course, the one we rent this
time is white!!

Speaking of fog lights...the &quot;factory&quot; fogs which sit in the indentations
on the front bumper are $$$$...about $350 for the pair! They may not
fit the US version as they are the projector type and the rear part
of the light unit is MASSIVE!!!, and will probably hit against
the A/C components in the right front wheel well.

Let me know if you want any further accessory postings!

P.S. I have the ventshades on our EV...they work GREAT...we also have
the lexan headlight covers (from Canada), and suspenders and a bra...
oops that was Monty Python...  8)
