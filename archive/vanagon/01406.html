Subject: fumes from fridge

Here's a refrigerator problem I haven't heard discussed yet:

My fridge starts OK (with a lot of pumping and swearing) and cools OK, 
but fills the van with fumes, products of combustion inclusing carbon 
monoxide, I'm sure. A nose check indicates the fumes are coming out of 
both the left side interior square vent and the long skinny vent behind 
the stove.

Fumes and heat also come out the exterior vent. I've been able to see any 
obstruction in that vent pipe.

I assume this fume thing is not normal or there would be a lot of dead 
campers. How cool does a properly operating fridge get on max cool?
Any ideas to fic the fumes?

Thanks,
