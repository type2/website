Subject: Re: Updated oil pressure switch? (wasserboxer)

&gt;
&gt;  Now for the next tale of woe... Some of you may remember that a year or
&gt;more ago, I posted a question asking if anyone had seen problems with that
&gt;damn dynamic oil pressure buzzer/light on the watercooled Vanagons. I got
&gt;a few replies from some people who did. Here's the two cent summary: drive
&gt;for 15 or so minutes at high speed, then decelerate, and at around 2200 rpm,
&gt;the oil pressure buzzer and light come on and stay on until the rpms go back
&gt;up above 2200 (usually from a blip of the gas pedal). Problem is worse with
&gt;10W-40 than 20W-50 and at higher ambient temps.
&gt;
&gt;  I had my Vanagon in three times under warranty for this. The dealer
&gt;replaced the dynamic oil system circuit board, put on a new VW oil filter,
&gt;and screwed around. They never found the problem and I got disgusted with
&gt;their imcompetence and swap-till-you-drop mentality. When I had my Vanagon
&gt;in for 60,000 mile service to the dealer I use now, I asked them to look
&gt;at it. The mechanic couldn't find anything wrong and recommended replacing
&gt;the oil pressure sending unit with a redesigned one to go off at a lower
&gt;pressure. The service advisor noted that the oil pressure checked ok. 

Yes, but did the switches open and close at the specified pressure.  If the
pressure is O.K., then the switch may just be switching at too high a
pressure.

He
&gt;noted that there would be four hours labor to do the job ($208) and said
&gt;that if I could live with it, he'd recommend waiting until I needed exhaust
&gt;work or other serious engine work (like head gaskets, but that's my other
&gt;story) so the labor cost wouldn't be such a big hit.

This is correct.  The switches are not accessed very easily.  One is under
the left head and one is by the oil pump (particularly hard to get to).

&gt;
&gt;  It sounds like the dynamic oil pressure system was a loser of a design
&gt;and VW is compensating for the poor design in a brute force way: make it
&gt;less sensitive. Does anyone know any more about the lower pressure switch
&gt;and any admissions by VW on this? 

I think the overall design is sound, but perhaps VW choose a switch with too
high a pressure limit - or again, yours might not be switching at the
specified limits.

 Also, I was considering seeing about
&gt;replacing the switch with one that also has pressure sending capability
&gt;for a oil pressure gauge. Any ideas or experience on this?

I've heard of someone replacing the switch under the left head with a
fitting, a short tube to remote mount the switch, and a 'T' so that the
switch and the new sensor could both be used.  I haven't seen this myself, so
I can't vouch for it's reliability.  Any time you add stuff like this on,
there's increased likelyhood of leaks.

Good luck Scott,
