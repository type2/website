Ken Stevens asks about the output of Westy-mounted solar arrays (tm). This
is going to be really vague because I haven't tested them extensively.
Output is about 16 Volts at 8 Amps in full sunlight, which we'll assume is
6 hours on a good day. Optimistically multiply all this and we get 768
Watt.hours, which is about 1 hp hour. Or I could run a 32 Watt appliance
24 hours a day. In theory. (Remember Homer J. Simpson's famous words:
&quot;In theory, communism works. In theory.&quot;) :-O

There are some losses associated with charging the deep-cycle battery. Not
sure how much. And when the battery is fully charged, the panels are
(hopefully) disconnected. Thanks to Bob (THE Bob), who sent me a nifty
voltage regulator for just that purpose. I'll tell ya all about it as soon
as it is tested and as soon as I pass my diss. proposal and submit those 2
papers for publication.... Phew! back to work :-(
