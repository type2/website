&gt; Stop poppin them damn weelies...That is what shakes everything loose.  I
&gt; limit myself in my '87 to about two weelies a week, and that's usually only
&gt; when i have a new passenger I want to scare the heck out of.....

Well... I remember SEEING a breadloaf that could pull wheelies...
With the stock engine, no less!  (and streetable tires!)

THe trick is to torch out the center section of the bus, (the sliding
door section) leaving a stubby little buslet...  It was :
A). Beautiful!
B). Hilarious
c)&gt; All of the above.

The owner said that he had to weight down the front end to make it
&lt;somewhat&gt; streetable...   Definitely a head-turner..

Also (on a totally unrelated note)  One of the rug stores here in Pittsburgh
had an upholstered bug as their company car...
Uphosltered on the OUTSIDE!  The whole bug was covered in rug...
What a fun car!
