&gt;&gt;This one has puzzled me also. If people are replacing the Diesel
&gt;&gt; engines with gas, why didn't VW do this in the first place?  Is the
&gt;&gt; rear cargo deck height higher on the diesel vanagons? Why Why Why?
&gt;
&gt;No, the engines are tilted at a greater angle to get them under the lid.
&gt; That is why the pan and oil pump are different.


Hmmm, to do that, I would have to run the V6anagon's engine upside-down.
I'd need an inverted carb setup and oil system... wonder if a Citabria
transplant would fit?   :^)
