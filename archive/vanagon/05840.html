David,

The ad WAS in National Lampoon....I have the issue somewhere in
my archives. Both VW and Ted threatened to sue, however due
to the 1st amendment, neither VW nor Ted could do anything, because
the ad was in fact considered &quot;protected&quot; speech.

Besides I don't think VW would ever make references to taudry
sexual affairs in one of their ads. There was, in true Doyle,
Dane, Bernbach tradtion, some copy below the headline referring
to Ted's pre-crash activities.
