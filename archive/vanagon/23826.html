Subject: Re: Vanagon motor swap???


What about a Jettagon?  I believe both Alistair bell and Ted Hoekman have 
transplanted Jetta motors into their Vanagons.  Ted's is real neat (I saw 
it when he was here in Vancouver) 'cause he put it in after he blew the 
diesel the van was made with.  Still has the &quot;diesel&quot; badge on it.  With 
the Jetta GLX (GLI? don't know Jettas that well) motor in it, it's a bit 
of a stealth vehicle.  The motor juuust fits--he had to remove the 
padding/insulation from one half of the engine compartment cover to give 
the motor clearance to fit.
