Subject:      more stuff from the new issue of HOT VWs :)

for those of you interested in the Concept 1, they have some spy photos
of the &quot;prototype&quot; &lt;NOT the little car that was shown around previously&gt;.
it's longer and lower and doesn't look as much like a beetle anymore. :(
looks more like a toyota. :P

this issue is also a blatant attempt to win over readers (?) from VW T&amp;A. :)

and for you 1968 owners, there is a really nice little article about your
buses when they were new. :)  lots of pictures.
