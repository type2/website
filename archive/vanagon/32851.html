Subject: KYB shock opinion  :(

always one to poke sacred cows, i'll voice my opinion and experience 
with KYBs.  and it ain't pretty.

I'm a slow learner.  I've put KYBs on a Fiat 124 spyder, a Volvo 
1800S, convinced my dad to put 'em on his Volvo 144.  I used them 
because #1 there was an application listing for my somewhat unique 
cars, and #2 they were cheap.

Here's how they held up:
-a weld for the mounting point broke off on 3 shocks
-fluid leaks on most
-surface rust on the outside (yes, cosmetic but really gross on bright 
white shocks) of all within a short time.
-worn out damping action on the Volvos within a short time period
-harsh ride (Gas-A-Just)

there have been list members that have been very pleased with them 
and i don't discredit their opinion.  maybe their quality has changed 
since i've bought them.  i'm not biting again, however.
