Well I got mine back 2 years ago for $29 on sale from the $39 price
FWIW I just got a new sale catalog last week with the set on sale for
the old $39 price.  I've raved before about what an unbeatable deal this
is months ago.  While ordering some other nice considerations are the 
16 pc industrial punch/chisel set (extremely nice quality, but only
the top of the line set) goes like $13 (similar chisels each $5 at
Sears) or the 15 pc 1/4 3/8 1/2 wobble extension set , which is not
exceptional quailty wise but can really get you out of a jam about $10.
I just nticed a new item a 3 pc locking 3/8 extension set which locks on
the socket for $10 which I'm ordering as should anyone who has ever lost
or nearly lost a spark plug socket on no 2 under the type 4 cooling tin.
Also a nice timing light with dial in advance now goes from them for
$45 (up to 60BTDC) I'm finally going into the next generation and
replacing dad's 20 year old (can only see in the dark, hook it into the
wires) 5$ model.  If anyone needs the catalog number and item numbers
email me I'll gladly provide.  Worth saving the $5 to get something
else.  BUT BE WARNED, ONCE YOU START GETTING THE CATALOGS YOU'LL WANT TO
BUY ALL KINDS OF STUFF YOU DON'T NEED.
