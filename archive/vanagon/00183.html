Hi all!

I am planning on doing some light bodywork to my VeeWees.
I was at Hechinger's today looking over their grinding
attachments for my power drill and wasn't sure what I
needed.

I need tools to cut out rusted metal and grind off rust.
What can people recommend?

I plan on using this with my electric power drill.  Should
I invest in a compressor and all that or will my drill work
fine?

Thanks --



Randy
