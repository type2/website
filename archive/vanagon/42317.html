Subject: Brake light flickering--Should I be worried?

(Sorry if this is a repost--I didn't see it come back from the list)

(note the cynical sarcasm in the subject line)

The brake light symptoms:
1. If the engine revs above 3000 rpm (and only after it's warmed up), the 
brake light will flicker dimly (more brightly as I rev higher). This is 
not tied to the vehicle's speed or rate of braking at all.

2. If I brake hard, I can get the light to come on and flicker brightly.

3. when I brake hard and it flickers, I hear a relay clicking away like 
mad. It's hard to tell from the driver's seat, but I swear that the sound 
is coming from under the driver's seat. Is there a brake relay there?

I haven't had a chance to look at the Bentley yet, but I suspect either a 
switch problem or an electrical problem. I'm also pulling the wheels this 
weekend to get ready for inspection,to look at changing the brakes, so 
I'll do some visual inspection then.

Oh yeah, I checked the brake fluid. It's up to Max, same as it's been for 
a year, when I had the fluid completely changed as part of routine 
maintenance.
Oh yeah 2: There's no discernible change in braking ability--I seem to be 
able to brake as well as ever, and my brakes are pretty good.

What do you think?
