 wkwood_at_burgoyne_dot_com comments,

&gt;While turbocharging a Diesel will clean up the smoke,
&gt;you'll actually lean out the engine without the corresponding increase in
&gt;fuel metering. 

  When I adjusted the fuel delivery screw on the injection pump to provide
  less fuel, the EGT read lower.  In other words the diesel seems 
  opposite of a gasoline engine with regards to air fuel mixture.

&gt; Keep the boost conservative (if you have a boost gauge) of
&gt;less than 8PSI for street use.  If you have a pyrometer keep the
&gt;temperature below 950F.  

   I am hoping that your pyrometer was mounted downstream of the turbo
   as my thermocouple is mounted on the manifold before the turbo and 
   keeping the temperature below 1100 F at 8 psi boost, ie. pushing the
loaded
   camper up a steep grade seems difficult.   Normal driving seems to run
   sustained temperatures of  600-800 F.   I think if I am pushing the engine
   too much, the first thing to go will be the headgasket.  It would be
interesting
   to know what temp the factory TD's run, although it has features like
piston
   oil squirters, different heat treat or alloy cylinder head, which should
allow 
   higher temp operation.
   

   Thanks for your comments
