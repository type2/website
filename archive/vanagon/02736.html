Subject: Re: now, how do I get the window out?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well here I am starting on this 69 camper, got some good advice on changing
&gt;the locks, and now I have to deal with the passenger window that has dropped.
&gt;No sweet, I have done a little of that before, besides, I have my trusty
&gt;Bentley manual and Haynes to supplement. Well, you have to take the whole
&gt;winder mechanism out before the window comes out, or so the manuals say. The
&gt;weld holding the window lift to the lifter was broken, but no problemo, I had
&gt;the 71 to get another of. What those manuals don not mention is that place
&gt;just up and to the right of the crank that goes clear across making it
&gt;impossible to get the mechanism out. After much banging (ouch!! I hate
&gt;indiscriminate banging) I got the sucker out. Now the Window, right? No way.
&gt;To get any angle on that sucker it looks like you got to rip out the window
&gt;scraper et. al. On manual does mention you have to disconnect the internal
&gt;guide on the right. Bottom bolt is no problem, but who can find that upper
&gt;bolt. So my question is, &quot;HOW DO I GET THIS WINDOW OUT??? I still have to do
&gt;the same on the 71 bus, and then put the sucker back into the 69? Well
&gt;somebody has had to go through this before. Is there a trick to removing the
&gt;winder gismo and the glass? Please, what is it?
&gt;

I took out the quarterlight by removing a tiny screw at the top, hidden in 
the felt channel. It'll probaly be rusty as hell and take a bit of finding. 
I think there may be a bolt at the bottom as well. Then slide the upright 
channel down into the door and pull the quarterlight out of the rubber. The 
winder mechanism should be free to come out once you get that upright out of 
the way. It was a long time ago that I did this but I do remember wrestling 
with that window for hours before getting it out. E-mail me if you can't 
find that secret hidden screw.
