Subject:       1985 Westy For Sale

The time has come for me to part with my 1985 Westfalia and I thought that 
I would give the list members first choice. I just put new batteries, 
tires, and brakes (drums, cynlinders, calipers, etc.) on it. It is 
brown with a tan interior. I'm asking $4200 for it (negotiable). I am 
located in Greensboro, NC. Please email if you would like additional 
info.


thanks,


ray...


p.s. I will still have my 1976 camper, so I won't  suffer to many 
withdrawal pains :-)
