Hey Volks,

Just had smog check on the Wayback and thought the results might be of 
interest to the list.

The engine is an 1835 (40mm intakes, 3/4 cam) with a CB Digital Fuel Injection 
system installed (an injector for each cylinder -- there's a picture on my Web 
page). 

The day of the test the air temp was about 106 (sunny Las Vegas!) and I'd been 
running some other errands so the engine was good and warm, oil temp about 
195.
