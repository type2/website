&gt;I'm hopefully far away from needing a rebuild, but does anyone have

&gt;
&gt;They have an ad in &quot;hot VWs&quot; and a web page:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.fastgermanauto_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt;They advertise rebuilt longblocks for $1595 with a rebuildable motor 
&gt;trade plus $250 roundtrip shipping.

They did a rebuild, as well as the r &amp; r, on my 85 Westy Waterboxer 2 years
ago.  I was very happy with their work.  They are very knowledgeable, take
time to answer your questions, and are reasonably priced.  In fact, I have
an 80 Westy air-cooled I plan to have them do this summer.

I have no connection with them, just a satisfied customer...

Take care...Bob Marshburn
