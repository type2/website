I don't think it's as easy as just cutting out a foot of exh pipe
and welding it in.
For one thing the pipes converge at the muffler and so you don't have
that &quot;full flow foot&quot; to put it in to.
But the big problem would be that it would REALLY increase your backpressure
to the point where your bus probably wouldn't run w/o a specially designed
camshaft and different timing.

The convergence problem could be overcome by putting in 4 cats (catalytic
converters not felines) one in each &quot;header&quot; and that would reduce back
pressure a lot too, but I still don't know if your bus would climb a hill
in anything higher than 2nd gear.

I'll stop rambling with my un-substantiated guesses.

Joel, you know everything, what do you think?
