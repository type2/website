Subject: Re: '81 versus '83 wasserboxer

&gt; Any opinions on power, reliability, maintenance, etc (2.0L air-cooled vs.
&gt; 1.9L wasserboxer)?
&gt; 
&gt; I have no experience thus far with the 2.0L air cooled. BTW, ain't no way
&gt; I'm getting rid of my 'new' '60 Westy!!

The '83 is going to be faster/more powerful any way round, the 2.0 is 
really huffing it to drag around a vanagon.  Still I'd go with the 
air cooled all else being equal, engine is cheaper, expensive but 
cheaper, fewer systems, less to worry about though I suppose the '83 
has no p/s so essentially its just a battle of cooling system 
problems and the heads.  Remember that gas heater may not run forever 
either and parts could be $$$$, plus the A/C on the thing is asking 
for trouble as well, but hell who needs it you got a sunroof.
