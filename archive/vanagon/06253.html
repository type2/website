A Gas company up here in Ottawa has Ethanol blend at the same price as
regular. I asked him if it was good for air cooled engines and his answer
was it has 15% higher octane, runs cleaner and cooler. Any opinions,
advice, experience with using ethonal blend  for air-cooled Vanagon engines?

BTW its 55 cents CDN per litre up here.....DC
