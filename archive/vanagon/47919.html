&gt; Subject:        Tire Questions

&gt; Three questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Can you still get Michelin MXL tires with reinforced sidewalls?
Not sure. Michelin LTX and Yoko Y370 LT tires have had good results.
 
&gt; 2. I've found LT 185/14 8 ply tires, will these work on my Vanagon?
Sounds fine, size &amp; load rating are correct.
 
&gt; 3. Where are the Vanagon archives located?
 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Justin
