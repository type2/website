&gt; Is breathing the smoke from a magnesium fire for certain harmful?

As a firefighter, I should be able to answer this.  However, I'm suffering
from information overload and can't recall off the top of my head.  The basic
rule of thumb for fires in houses, almost everything in a house gives off
lethal gases.  Wood does't do much for poisening except take away your O2,
but carpets give off phosgene gas.

Best bet, Martha, stop burning those old bus engines.  I'll see what I can
find on what's given off from magnesium combustion.
