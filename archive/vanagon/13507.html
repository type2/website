&gt; sent the entire FI system into a tizzy.  If anyone else has run into this 
&gt; problem, you may want to consult with your Service Manager and see if there is 
&gt; a service bulletin on this very issue.  If someone could get a copy (God 
&gt; forbid) of this Service Bulletin, I think we'd all be interested in getting a 
&gt; copy via the discussion board.....

I have all Service Bulletins covering all VW '80 to early '94 on
microfiche, don't think there is anything about this but I'll check,
If anyone ever needs a copy of a bulletin, drop me a note and I'll
mail you a copy.  There is a fairly current list of the bulletins in the
general FAQ at UMD I believe.  I note the bulletins as well as manuals
are very cheap on microfiche, that giant Vanagon manual goes for $15
or so but you need a reader, or can use a libraries.
