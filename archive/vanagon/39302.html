So Renee Norris says:
&gt;      I hope to get response on this matter.  I am looking at a 1987 
&gt; Vanagon Camper Syncro at a dealership.  The body is in great shape as is 

I think if you're going to buy from a dealer, the key is to get them
to give you a good warranty and get it in writing.  The price they're
asking is probably not too far off base.  I'd ask for records and get
lots of written reassurance that they will service the car for any
problems (at least mechanically) that come up.  Get a warranty that
covers the vehicle for as long as possible.  If they give you any
shit about that point then walk away.  It's not worth it if they can't
back it up with a good warranty.

&gt; 	Please, help me out on this one.  I am using my '86 Volvo for 
&gt; trade if I get it.  I was offered $2000 as trade in for the Volvo and 
&gt; the remainder is $9300  &quot;out the door&quot; (tax, tags...etc.)

What's a Volvo?  Is that some kind of body part or something?  ;)
