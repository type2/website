howfun :-}
I want a 1991 fully loaded Westie, with low miles...ok i can dream!
color would be blue or the same Flash Silver my Carat is. Add cd
changer.
first place i'd go...florida(from socal) to see my VW pals Dave &amp;
Cindy, and their Herbie clone &quot;Penny&quot; .

realistically i got my dream bus, my Carat. Affordable and NICE. I'll
never be ableto afford a 91 westie, they're $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
here!!! I just saw one going for $22,000!!!!
