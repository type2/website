Subject: head leakage conjecture

        Reply to:   head leakage conjecture
Ron, I have heard or read that recently.  (see ron's ? below)  My guess would
be that the heads tighten just a bit in the summer due to expanding metal. 
That might make sense if the water jacklets were an AL alloy, compared to
steel bolts.  Mind you, I don't know this for sure, but that would be my
guess.  

Does anyone with supior knowledge have an opinion on this??  Maybe we should
snug up our heads bolts in the summer?

What with all the current projects going on, non-leaking heads in the summer
is the least of my worries.  Same thing with the &quot;leaking in the winter&quot;
clutch slave cylinder.  That I know was leaking, I can see it, I doubt anyone
can easily pull it out, I used to put brake fluid in every 2 weeks, havn't now
for 2 months, so go figure.

Well, I only have two things to say

1.  The hardest part of any job is starting,
2.  The second hardest part of any job is restarting.

Ron queried:     Could this be explained by the expanding the contracting of
the metal asthe temperature changes?

&gt;I was told by reliable sources that the dealer probably did a leak check at
max pressure, and that might have opened a small leak.  For the rest of the
winter, I had to refil the tank every couple of weeks.  Now that summer is
sort of here, the problem seems to have gone away.
