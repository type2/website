Subject: Unstick Lock Key Holes?

My newly purchased '85 Westy has door locks that will work from the 
inside but on the outide you can't get the key to go all the way into the 
lock. I was told by a locksmith that VW uses heavy grease in their locks 
and to just keep squirting WD-40 into them untill they freed up then use 
a good lube spray.  I have tried this several times-no luck. The only way 
I can lock up is to lock the two front doors &amp; slider then crawl through 
the back hatch and lock that (thaat one works!) Not a pretty sight!
Any suggestions?  (Was always parked near salt water)
