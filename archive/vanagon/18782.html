Subject:      A tent for the 69 camper



Well this is the first posting I have made since I left for England last fall.
I am gearing up for a camping trip soon, trying to get the westy ready. And
Joel, you were right, the windshield did crack. I got it in, it looked great,
there was a bit of a leak the next rain, I gave it a bit of a bump were the
seal didn't look all the way overlapping, and the thing cracked--major bummer.
It cracked the same place that two layers metal meet on the lower left side.
Well, I am just stupid enough, and poor enough, to do it again before the
trip.

The reason for this post is to ask if there are any ideas for a tent that
attaches to the bus. I have seen pictures of the split-screens with one, *as
in the June Hot VW, but have no ideas as to sources or how to construct one
for a 69.
  Anybody else?
