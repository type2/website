     The wife and I came home today after a leisurely afternoon shopping, 
came around the corner to park her car (she gets the garage) drove past 
my van and......    

     HEY!!! the driver's mirror is gone!

     Its not just torn off either, some SOB actually took the time to 
unscrew the thing!   Strangely they left the gasket behind.

     Suffice to say I'm a little pissed off right now.  I don't know any 
other list members here (Columbus, Oh), but if anyone here sees a van 
with a newly replaced driver's mirror with a badly (lower, outside) 
placed 4&quot; round convex, let me know.

     As for now, I'm gonna skulk around grumbling to myself.

     Bob
     84GL, sans driver's mirror
     85GL, awaiting rebuild project engine (sans *both* mirrors)
