Subject: Vanagon for sale

Interested parties in MA area-

Listed today in Boston Globe:

1986 Vanagon camper, one owner, good condition, $6500/bo - no miles given
(508) 535-2247

Seems I've seen more'n a few people interested in buying lately, so I thought 
I'd throw it out there.

I think someone has also listed a EV for around 13K, but I don't have it in 
front of me.

Good luck

Mike
