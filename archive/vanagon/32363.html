There was some talk before the holidays about potable water pumps.  Well, 
I returned the 500gph bilge pump, and bought a $16 universal windshield 
washer pump from NAPA.  The hose connections are a bit tricky, I haven't 
gotten it together without leaks yet, but the pressure is just about 
right (if slightly on the weak side).

I also put in some 5W-30 oil with my 80K :) filter/oil change.  It's 
great for the cold weather here in Syracuse, Started right up at 20 below 
(Fahrenheit)!
