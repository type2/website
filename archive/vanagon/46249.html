Subject: Aftermarket Exhaust Parts for '87 Westie
Date: Tue, 9 Jul 96 21:34:02 -0500

Hi Everybody:

Well, well, well. The Mint Condition '87 Westie needs LOTZ of exhaust work.... 
My trusted friend/mechanic says I need new header pipes, and he has been unable 
to find a source other than volkswagen, who wants a total of about $500 for all 
the necessary stuff! Surely someone knows where to get quality after market 
exhaust parts! I checked the FAQ but did not find info. Any ideas?

Do I want to go to Midas for this sort of thing?

Steve

'87 Westie
'93 Eurovan MV (STILL FOR SALE!!! $14,500)
