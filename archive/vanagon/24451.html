Subject: Re: Charcoal canister

While I have a ' 71 Kombi that has the canister removed and have noe problem
with it---there is my ' 73 Super that has had her canister removed and I ma
having a great deal of a problem with Gas odor. So bad in fact that she has
been retired to short trip duty.  There is another post regarding my problem
on the Vanagon list as well as the Vinatgvw list. and again any help with my
gas odor problem will be greatly rewarded with a donation of some of the
brain cells that I won't be burning up while smelling all of these gas fumes.
