derek,

you might want to send that alignment message to harris upham, the editor
of the LiMBO transporter (if you don't mind them publishing it).  the real
problem seems to be (from my own personal experience) that Hunter and Bear
(the alignment machine companies) used the 1980-1983 vanagon specs!!! even
if you have a non-syncro, but have a vanagon that is lowered (like the 1988
and later, or the earlier Wolfsburg Limited Editions), the specs are just
flat WRONG! so i have to take my Bentley book along and make him set the car
to the bentley book specs ... and then actually compare his printout to the
bentley book myself.

ain't it fun having an exotic car!!! :)

joel
