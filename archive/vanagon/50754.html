Subject: re: Tires

I want to thank Gerry for the second message - this subject has
been discussed so much I felt a little out of line bringing it up,
and more out of line after his first response. 

I had searched the archives for &quot;tires&quot; - too many hits to deal with,
and followed it up with &quot;tires; vanagon&quot;, which is a workable list
but for whatever reason did not include a crucial post.

Gerry provided the key word, however, and a search on &quot;Yokahama&quot; will
lead you to one of Dennis Haynes' informative pieces:
http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/msg?m=msg03979&amp;a=/v96/vanagon.96.02
which, as other listmembers do, offers some well reasoned alternatives
to the 205/70R 14.

Meanwhile, the like new no-name 205/70 14s are still FS.  Maybe they 
might be more useful than I thought; the load rating code is 93.

Tom F.
