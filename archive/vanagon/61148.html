From: Robert Cronin &lt;cronin_at_meol.mass_dot_edu&gt;
Subject: 82 Diesel Westy FS in MA

Now Im definitely selling:
The Good:
rebuilt engine about 2 yrs ago. _at_15000 mi
same time new H20 pump, oil pump, brake master cylinder, clutch,
rebuilt tranny from German Trnsaxel about 8000mi ago
new battery 1 mos ago
other stuff; coolant tank, hoses, regular maintenance
all camping stuff intact (all tables) pop top excellent (no rips) screen 
is torn never used the stove fridge or sink.  I assume they allare in 
working order
nice tweed front seat covers.
The Bad:
stable leak in injector pump.  Im driving it now without major fuel loss 
but it needs either a rebuild or a donor froma rabbit/jetta soon. 
will need ball joints soon
tires are crappy.
The interior is in relatively good shape - afew minor tears here and 
there; the interior panel on the slider has some dings.
The flaps have broken springs.
being a diesel its SLOWWWWW! ;)
The Ugly:
Although the van is virtually rust free, there are 3 fairly substantial 
dents:
1. Rear hatch has a vertical dent on the right side.  The glas is fine 
and the door seals.  The mangled bumper has been replaced.
2. The passenger side was hit at the rear of the slider, doing most of 
the damageto the wheel well, and lower rear panel between the slider and 
wheel.  The door opens and closes fine, although there is a smell sliver 
of daylighton the rear side. it does not leak at all.
3 The driver side has a very shallow dent 1/2 way down.  I think this 
would be easily pulled out by anyone with body experience.

thats about all I can think of.  The van runs great even with all the 
above problems.  A few hundred (or significantly les for an experienced 
do-it yourselfer) dollars would get the van running perfectly again.  It 
needs some cosmetic help, but with the rust free body the potential is 
definitely there. the van is assuan brown with a dark brown rug, plaid 
tweed curtains, cushions and white cabinetry.
Ive spent OVER $4500 (with receipts)getting it into fine running condition, 
but cant afford to keep paying these &quot;VW Specialists&quot; %$50/hr everytime 
something goes wrong, although this is the first time in months its been 
in the shop. I'm trying to save money to move and cant sink the money in 
to paying to have it fixed.  Any experinced peson could do most if not 
all him or herself. I need to get $1800 for it. any interested parties 
contact me at westo_1_at_hotmail_dot_com or cronin_at_meol.mass_dot_edu.
thanks for the read.
