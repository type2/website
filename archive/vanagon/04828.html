Having noticed the absence of a '57 microbus on the stats listing
I was compelled to relate my sighting this week.  I was
pulling out of the parking lot with my 68 right hand drive camper
when I saw an old vw bus with the bullet type front signals.
Turns out its a 57 with the ORIGINAL PAINT.  The color is not
special (two light shades of green).  The interior is matched to
the exterior color. Although it is not perfect, it has almost no
rust(amazing feat for a Canadian vehicle), certainly a nice rig
for one that appears to had had nothing done to the exterior in
over 35 years!  

	I told him about the mailing list, yet he has not got a
computer account yet!  Gave him advice to do it though.  That
zero next to the 57 on the list gave me incentive to go into
recruiting mode.

	BTW, there are some other Right hand drives here in
Calgary.  One is a late 60's bug which parks a block from my
house every weekday.  It was a washed out pink color and was
rather ordinary except for its 1302 badge.  However, last week a
newly restored bug took its place.  Seems as though the woman
that owns it (I saw her once when be actually pulled up to a
traffic light together!  rare occurrence since I have seen less
than 10 right hand drive of any make here in Calgary!).  Funny
thing was she did not notice my RHD van! 

	Back to the story, the bug is now a beautiful metallic
green with matching paint on the wheels.  The trim has be redone
as well, overall the car looks great!  Its too bad that more of
these oddity vws don't make it to shows.  Maybe its because they
generally charger you to display your rig but let you view for
free.  Does anyone else think this is backwards?

	Hope people don't mind me discussing bugs!
