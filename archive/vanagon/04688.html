&gt;and cb radios
&gt;and ham radios and cellular phones &lt;has anybody REALLY 
&gt;got one of these in
&gt;their bus??&gt;

We don't have any cellular phones (period!) - but
here's a bug story for you all (slight digression
from bricks - sorry).

Anthony and his boss Don just finished some welding 
work, sent out for painting, and restoring in general, 
a '74 bug for the boss's 18-year old daughter to drive. 
It came out really beautiful - all original. 

Anthony made sure there was some basic emergency
stuff in the car - Don threw in the cellular phone!
I thought it was a great idea. Too bad he could not 
find a green phone to match the color of the bug 
(bummer). And yes, the car is older than she is (ah, 
to be young again...)! 


Lori (and Anthony)
