Subject: Re: DIESEL VANAGON QUESTIONS
From: alun jenkins &lt;alun_at_krypton.win-uk_dot_net&gt;

 
&gt;QUESTIONS by Susan &amp; James Kramer_at_igs 
&gt;&gt; 1) How long does the engine last, or better phrased, how much shorter is
&gt;&gt; the life expectancy than in a Rabbit?
Mine has just blown up at only 60k Miles :-(
Head is beyond repair and over $1000 for a new one

&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2) After the 5 minute acceleration lead-up, at what speed can the Diesel
&gt;&gt; Vanagon cruise comfortably on level highway?
&gt;
I have a 1700 which will hold 70-75 Mph on a flat road (a friend
has a 1.6TD that wil hold 80-85 and 90 at a push !)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3) What are people's actual experiences with mileage around town and on the
&gt;&gt; highway?
Again for my 1.7 24-36 depending on terrain

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any feedback about pros and cons particular to Diesel Westfalias would be
&gt;&gt; appreciated.
&gt;
Pros: if the fuel leaks while your asleep your not toasted ! :-)
Cons: VW spares prices I thibking real serious about droping
another engine in mine
