&gt;I have been searching for an aftermarket exhost system for my 84 vanagon

&gt;'performance' system.  Do i need to start manufacturing a system?  Would 
&gt;you buy one?.....Thanks, Stuart Crowell, Plymouth NH

Afetr market exhaust is available.  No off shelf performance options.  Avoid
the Walker muffler.  Goob import FLAPS should be able to get you Bosal
Muffler and DANSK pipes.  Pipes should be around $120 each,(3).  Brackets
stillhave to come from dealer. All brackets must be ther to keep exhaust from
cracking.
