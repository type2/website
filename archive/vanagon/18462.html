Subject: Re: WANTED: Rear window for `59 23-window!

Eric,
Please be more specific regarding your 23 window request. Do you need the
corner glass, the rear hatch with glass, or just the rear hatch glass only?
Does the rear hatch glass from a '63 15 window fit a '59 23 window? Wasn't
there a size difference with the deluxe hatches compared to the Kombi
hatches of similar year during this vintage ('59-'63)? I admit that I'm
unclear about this point.

&gt;Direct all prospcts to my brother_at_ 360.427.9155: if you
&gt;call collect, just say `23-window'when they want your name-
&gt;he'll understand.
