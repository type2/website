Subject: bumper value

          hey gang,  got rear-ended last night and just rebuilt bumper
          got crunched.  it's a deluxe bumper on a '66 kombi.  the
          actual bumper (the big horiz piece) is fine as is the
          overider. the driver's side vertical piece (that connects to
          the overrider and bumper) is crunched and split open.  the
          bolt came right thru it!  i have to call the offending
          driver's insurance company soon and i want to have a value
          in mind for this piece and/or the entire bumper in the event
          i can't find the piece.  any clues??     ray gainesville, fl
