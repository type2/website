Subject: 87 Westy needs new power locks

Hi All!

I've had my '87 Westy GL for about 18 months and am still in love, though
it has tested my patience and my wallet.

The latest little problem is the power locks.  They've been kind of going
for awhile, but seem to be completely dead at the moment (you can't lock or
unlock them manually or otherwise).

I found out that they've been &quot;superceded&quot; with a newer version which
requires an additional linkage of some kind.  So the total cost for parts
will be about $123 per door.  That would be from the dealer here in town.

Two questions:  Is there a cheaper source I should be checking?  Is this
something a novice do-it-yourselfer could attempt?

Thanks!

Kathy McElveen
