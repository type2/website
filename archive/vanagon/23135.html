Subject: Re: scooter car query

for the erudite there were two different kinds of bubble cars made in germany
in the late fifties early sixties
there was a heinkel that had the driver &amp; pass. sitting side by side and the
front door opened forward.
I was in one that had no reverse gear (defunct not a design feature) and I
parked facing a wall downhill !!! you can not get out!!
the second was the much loved messerschmidt, this was a great car and is
written up in several old journals.
PS the first was also made by BMW and was called an Isetta is written up in
early BMW books.
