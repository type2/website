Subject: 93 EV piston slap

Hey listies!

        I'm considering the purchase of a 93 EV MV weekender.  I have a
question about piston slap.  If this vehicle is one of the bad crop, when,
typically, would the slapping start?  This van has 72k on it, and I haven't
seen it in person yet, so I don't know if it makes the dreaded deisel
clatter, or if the engine/pistons have been replaced by the PO.  Please
help!!!  This van may be &quot;the one&quot;, but i want to be sure!

                        Thanks!

                         Ned
