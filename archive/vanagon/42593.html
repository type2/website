&gt;      I've found that it was not necessary to have the latches pull the 
&gt;      windows in real tight in order to seal the frames. I have set mine so 
&gt;      that they just pull the window lightly onto the body seal. I bolted 
&gt;      the dash clips on instead on welding them so that I could adjust them 
&gt;      once i'd fitted the windows.

I wasn't wrenching these very tightly at all.  The damn things flop 
around when they aren't even latched!  It seems the story is they buy
the latches from some place thats reproin them (ie wolfsburg west) and
they _know_ they are crap, but there's nothing they can do about it,
which is why they will gladly kick down new ones for free.
