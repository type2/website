Subject:      Re: EV GAS

 In the US system, the minimum octane for the EV is 87. I was used 89 or
higher for 2 1/2 years, then recently switched to 87 and there is no per-
ceptible difference.
 Just a guess but &quot;environmental oil&quot; sounds like a euphemism for recycled
oil. Maybe the recommendation has an environmental basis. I've just used
Castrol GTX 10w40 with no problems. The engine seems strong and uses little
oil (maybe 1/2 quart in 3000 miles).
 BTW....I would be a little slow to take the Seattle dealer's word about
VW having decided to make no more vans for the US market. Does he not have
the proverbial &quot;vested interest&quot; in making the used EV's on his lot seem as
rare as Susan B Anthony dollars?
