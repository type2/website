1) Check marine suppliers for all components including SPDT centre off.

2) The battery isolator is of no use whatsoever without a &quot;battery selector 
switch to take one of the batteries out of circuit during charging.  The
switch 
you need comes from a marine supply house (try West Marine chain in US)

3) the reason for 2) is best understood by reading a book on Marine Electric 
systems try &quot;The 12 Volt Bible&quot;

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hello.
&gt;I have equipped my '81 Westy with an Eveready Premium marine deep-cycle
&gt;and starting battery (850 MCA, 120 Amp Hours) oohaah! I have it hooked
&gt;up to the (pathetically inadequate) 65 amp alternator by way of a dual
&gt;battery isolator.  I can now monitor the charge of *both* batteries with
&gt;the LEDs on the stove panel, because I replaced the SPST micro-mini
&gt;switch with an SPDT with a center 'off' position. (BTW nobody seems to
&gt;supply these anymore, so you have to modify an SPDT to have an 'off',
&gt;e-mail me if you want to know how)   
&gt; I've noticed that while driving, the main battery (the group 41, which
&gt;is brand new) is not charging fully. It's LED remains on yellow most of
&gt;the time. I suspect that the 'el cheapo' isolator has too high a
&gt;resistance for the (pathetically inadequate) 65 amp alternator to
&gt;overcome sufficiently in order to charge both batteries. Believing this
&gt;to be true, I rushed out and purchased one of those fat relays that
&gt;links both batteries together only after you turn on the ignition.    
&gt;
&gt; Okay here are the questions...[drumroll]
&gt;
&gt; I am concerned that the real problem is that the two batteries are too
&gt;different in their respective resistance's to charge equally. So the
&gt;greedy deep-cycle battery is hogging all the charge and not leaving any
&gt;for poor Mr. Group 41! 
&gt; #1-Is this a factor in my dilemma? 
&gt; #2-Do they sell and isolator that provides an appropriate charge to
&gt;each battery depending in what type it is, eg. deep-cycle/group 41?
&gt;(sorta like those master cylinders made for cars with front disc and
&gt;rear drum?) 
&gt;
&gt; I also figured that in order to prevent the deep-cycle battery from
&gt;sharing in the burden of cranking over the engine, I would find a place
&gt;to connect the relay that only becomes 'hot' after the engine is
&gt;running. I believe that the wipers go off and possibly the headlights
&gt;too, I'll have to check. 
&gt; #3-Does any one want to save me the time of searching and tell me the
&gt;approximate location the relay that does that neat trick of temporarily
&gt;shutting off the wipers and lights? I noticed a 'load reduction relay'
&gt;in the WISE AND POWERFULL BENTLY MANUAL's wiring diagrams, is that the
&gt;one that I seek?? Please don't make me look at those wiring diagrams
&gt;anymore, they make my head hurt!! ;)
&gt;
&gt; Is there anything that I'm overloo...no, let me rephrase that...what am
&gt;I overlooking?
&gt;
&gt; Oh, and yes, I am aware of the kit that boosts the output of the stock
&gt;alternator by leaps and bounds, but I don't wish to spend the $125 to
&gt;get one. Well, not unless I have too...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance, during, and after.
