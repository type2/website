Subject:      Warm Idle Racing

Hi all...

I saw another message similar to my problem, but there wasn't enough info
for me to figure out if our probs were the same.  My '87 starts and runs
fine when cold.  While cold, the idle takes a second or two to settledown
from 1500 to around 950.  If it seems to be a bit high, I can ease out
the clutch for just a second, and the load will pull it down, where it
will stay just fine.  Once the engine gets good and warm, the idle starts
to behave rather odd.  As I downshift when coming up to a light or
whatever, the engine is forced to around 3000.  As I stop and push in the
clutch, the idle slows to 1000, then bucks up to around 2800-3000.  If I
then rev the engine to 3500, it drops down to 1000 for a second then
bucks righr back up to 2900 again.  If I ease the clutch out, the engine
just keeps pulling.  I have to sit at lights and either listen to the
engine freerev at 2900, or use the clutch to keep the idle low (while
sacrificing my clutch lining).  I don't think it is the bypass valve, as
I cleaned it and it has had no effect (also it works fine cold). I've
checked the boots between the throttle body and the air flapper gizmo.

Any suggestions at all would be appreciated....

Thanks
