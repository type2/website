&gt; Back during the winter/spring, a couple of folks up here in the southern new

&gt; drive-in. Well, it's summer (obvious to all...). Any interest in doing a get
&gt; together probably at the 4 screen drive in in N. Smithfield RI (20 min north
&gt; of Prov) on 146? I'm thinking of heading there with the family sometime in
&gt; the next couple of weeks.
