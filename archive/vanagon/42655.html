Pat asked about how the outer end of a drive shaft comes off, compared to the
inner end.
If I understand correctly, the answer is:

there are identical bolts (six) holding the outer CV/axle assembly to the
wheel bearing end. You need a ratchet driver and extension bar, with the
correct spline driver for the bolt-heads. 

Jack up the wheel in question, put in a safety stand, block the van wheels
really well (check you cant push it off the stand), put ON the parking brake,
then crawl under, with your feet towards the front of the van. Look where you
see the drive shaft go into the wheel arm; use a penlight torch and you should
be able to see a couple of bolt heads. 

Push the rubber boot aside if necessary to see them, with wide boots the heads
are hidden. Try not to trash the boot with the spline-driver but think if you
want to replace it as a preventative measure, given that you're taking it
apart anyways.

With the hand-brake on, undo the two bolts (you need the brake ON to resist
the force of the wrench) that you have access to. It's a do-it-by-touch job
really. Make sure you have the _correct_ spline driver 'cos it'll be hell if
you strip the heads. Don't assume the PO has put the same type of bolt in
every hole ;-)

Two Bolts out? find the washers! Get out, let off the hand brake, rotate the
wheel a third-turn, then brake back on, wobble the van to check safety, go
back under - you'll be able to get to the next two nuts.

continue this little routine  until they're all out. It may require swearing
loudly before it works, like all VW maintenance &lt;g&gt;. I prefer to undo the
wheel end before the drivetrain end because it's all less likely to fall on
your head. 

Refitting is, as they say, the revese sequence to removal, but I like to line
the wheel arm with clean newspaper so if it all falls apart as I'm fighting to
line up the holes, it doesn't get dirt in my nice clean CV joint grease. Oh
yes, try really hard not to lose the little dished lock-washers and locking
plates - you don't always get new ones with a new CV boot.

caveat transporter, as they say. . . .
ben
with the shorter transporter.
