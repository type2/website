&gt;&gt; I have begun receiving messages which indicate the original sender as sender

&gt;&gt; Gerry is doing or if my AOL software has begun doing this. 

All the messages I receive indicate the original sender. But since I
recognize the names, I'll often assume that they are to the list and not
personal. So I would like to apologize to anyone who might have sent a
personal message and did not get a reply because I deleted it precipitously.
