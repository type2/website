&gt; Does anyone know anything about a BLM campground called Wailaki
&gt; (pronounced why-locky).  It is part of the King Range Nat.
&gt; Conserv. Area over on the coast, kind of northeast of say, Chico.
&gt; 
&gt; It was suggested to me by the BLM that we camp there, and I'm awaiting
&gt; printed snail mail about the area.  All input appreciated!  :)

I've not been to Wailaki but I have been to the Kings Range/Lost Coast 
area and its stunningly beautiful.  We drove the loop road from Ferndale 
down to Petrolia and camped overnight at the Mattole Campground right on 
the beach a mile or so above the Punta Gorda lighthouse.  Quiet, isolated 
area, though there were several other campers scattered along the beach.  
Took the Mattole River road out, via Honeydew, picking up 101 near Weott, 
as I recall.  Roads are mixed pavement/gravel, narrow and sometimes 
potholed, winding on occasion in a fairly precipitous fashion.  This, 
coupled with the locals predisposition to drive at high speed, all over 
the road, can make for some interesting moments.  The last few miles of 
the road from Honeydew to 101, were like a fairy-tale;  winding through 
the redwoods, over pine needles, the road so obscure we weren't sure at 
times we were really on it.  The Petrolia area (and road from Cape 
Mendocino, just north of it) reminds me of what I imagine the Big Sur area 
looked like before Hwy 1 was pushed through (remember, this area is called 
the &quot;Lost Coast&quot; because they COULDN'T get the road thru).  Haven't been 
to the Shelter Cover area (the area Wailaki is in), but based on the 
Tourist Info center in Garberville, its MUCH more developed (and 
accessible) than the Petrolia section - modern beachfront condos and golf 
courses!  According to my map Wailaki is a couple of miles inland, about 
half way down the Shelter Cove road.  Based on my traverses of the Kings 
Range just north, it'll probably be a beautiful, wooded valley.  Its a 
gorgeous area in any case.  Let me know what you find.
