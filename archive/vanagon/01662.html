Subject:      85's move into 3rd place. plea to Unknowns.

awright, folks. we're starting to see a little movement from the vanagons

pack by a wide margin ... let's identify with some year and model (or a
Wanabus: looking and haven't decided). :)

 Vanagon Mailing List   190 people,     174 vehicles
    20 Microbus,    76 Bus,    73 Vanagon,     5 Eurovan
    23 Unknown,    10 Wanabus

and i still think it's odd that only one 1975 bus is on here. what with
the numbers of 73, 74, 76, 77, and so forth, you'd think that there would
be at least two more 75's.  ???
