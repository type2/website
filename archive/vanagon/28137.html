David Schwarze has told of his find of two perfect late 70's brown bus
seats.  He has professed his lack of time to go get them and ship them
to anyone.  Is there anyone else out there willing to do the same?  If
I paid them for their time and the shipping?  They are currently 
$22.50 each.  If they really are perfect.  David?  Anyone?  I assume 
they are near Sandy Eggo.  Thanks, Jim  (currently headrestless)
