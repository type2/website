Subject: PNW trip (again?)

You know, it is starting to warm up out there. Time to think about that PNW
&quot;Gathering of the Vans&quot; that we've oft discussed. Unfortunately, I'm
starting to get committments piled up so I'll start out proposing a couple
of dates:

Assuming that Fort Flagler on Marrowstone Island is the designated place:
April 20-21 -  (but I have a house warming to attend that afternoon so
wouldn't arrive until early evening)
April 27-28 - (the only date open for sure)
May 4-5 - Mount Constitution (on Orcas Island - BBTC is planning a mtb ride
that weekend and I'm hoping to go up there then anyway!) This could be an
interesting mix of people...
May 11-12 -  (tentative, depends upon whether I go to WWDC this year or not)
May 18-19 -  (again depends upon whether I'm at WWDC or not)
May 25-26 - (this one looks open)

Hopefully I'll still have a bit of that oatmeal stout left, and I just
bottled a fresh batch of brown ale tonight that will be ready in 2-3 weeks
so there'll some of that for sure!
