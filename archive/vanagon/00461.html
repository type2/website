Hi all,  I recently joined the list:  very useful information.

I drive a '86 syncro vanagon.  The mileage is always 18-20 mpg.  A good
portion of this is highway (65-70 mph).  Its a box on wheels - I have not
noticed significant changes based on speed, wind, use of AC, etc.  I do
have 27x8.50 off road tires.

In PA we have to use &quot;oxygenated&quot; gas during the winter;  this does knock
2 mpg off the above numbers.

&quot;Its a box on wheels&quot; is not a knock, I love the van.  I bought it new and it
now has 128000 miles.  It has probably been more expensive to maintain than
anything else I've owned.
