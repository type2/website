Subject: Re: A few diesel engine questions.


&gt;1. Install new plugs, drain the oil and replace with cheap crap.
&gt;2. Pull the injectors, inspect and clean junk off, pray they are
&gt;not rusted solid, replace install new OEM fuel return lines.
&gt;3. Start the engine (well I hope) on a can of Lubro Moly Diesel
&gt;Purge, let run as long as it can off that.
&gt;4. Drain the fuel tank (sadly this was not done) fill with a few
&gt;gallons new diesel, replace any rubber lines I see, remove fuel/water
&gt;filter, clean housing install new filter element and pray the tank
&gt;did not rust badly (they are steel aren't they, I haven't looked)
&gt;5. Let it run a few hours, drain the oil, change filter and fill
&gt;with good Shell 15W-40, let it cool and adjust the valves.
&gt;6. Replace the timing belt as I have a brand new one, I can't find
&gt;my old Rabbit manual though so any tips/suggestions here would be
&gt;appreciated, I know they won't run if you screw it up.
&gt;7. Get it inspected and give it to him if I don't become to fond
&gt;of it myself.

I have the 79, 80, 81 Rabbit /Jetta /Pickup repair manual and the Dasher
repair manual--both cover the 1500cc diesel (I had the 1981 1584cc
Dasher/Passat Diesel myself).  Anything you would like Xeroxed out of it,
let me know. Will mail.

You know why the reason why some nights you don't have a dream?
When there's just blackness? And total silence?

Well, this is the reason:
It's because on that night you are in somebody else's dream.
And the reason you can't be in your own dream because
you're already busy in somebody else's dream.
