Subject: Re: unplug '86 idle stabilizer?

&gt; I've been following the high and wandering idle thread(s) of late as I have
&gt; been suffering the same malady. After trying all the suggestions to no
&gt; avail, I finally unplugged the idle stabilizer today and, TADA! The idle is
&gt; steady at about 800 rpm, even in park and neutral!
&gt; 
&gt; So my question is, is it ok to leave it unplugged? Will it affect anything?
&gt; Gas mileage, etc? Considering it's a &gt;$200 part, that would be nice but it
&gt; seems all to easy a solution.
&gt; 
Well, it will affect some things -- you may have to set your idle up a bit,
and if you have A/C or power steering, it may die when the compressor kicks
in or when you hit the end of travel on the power steering.  Since one of my
busses has neither, I have not replaced the unit yet, but borrowed one from
my other car for passing smog (I don't know if it needed this, though).

This unit was subject to a recall for '86 and '87's.  The new part should
be 251-907-393D, and if you have an earlier one, perhaps the dealer will
give you the right one.  Recall campaign was &quot;PB&quot; Date 870414, and this was
a biggie -- replacing the fuel tank, the idle stabilizer, the ECU, some filters
and hoses.
