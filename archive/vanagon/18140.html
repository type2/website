Subject: RE: Re-organization of rec.autos.vw, PLEASE READ

Why the focus on the car?  Maybe the breakdown should be on the basis of 
average expense per week, so that the survivalists can discuss carving
grommets out of used tire sidewalls and the it's-only-moneyists can 
debate which side out VW put the gaskets on the Forstdienst model in
1953.  

Oh, all right, I'll admit it:  I don't have much use for rec.autos.vw
given the responsiveness and accuracy of the vanagon list.
