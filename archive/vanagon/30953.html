Subject: Coil Draining Battery?

Well, I can't figure out what's draining the battery in my '71. I 
replaced the voltage regulator and upon investigation noted that the old 
one had a buildup between the contacts on one of the points inside...so I 
though I had the problem solved.

I fired up the bus and let her idle in the driveway for awhile. I noticed 
that the gas gauge was reading full and jiggled some wires under the 
dash; went back down to 1/4.

Maybe I'm naive, but I wouldn't think that a simple dash short (the 
jiggle wire kind) would drain the battery in a few minutes.

Could the coil be fried and sucking the juice out of the system? Should I 
investigate the alternator next? I'm getting *some* juice out of it as I 
have an ammeter attached in place of generator light...because I can't 
figure out what's wrong with the generator light.

So many problems....so little time.

Thanks! Joe
