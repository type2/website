&gt;&gt;Alan Funt is still alive and well in Pebble Beach and playing avid tennis
&gt;&gt;there, last I heard, by the way....
&gt;
&gt;But... does he drive a VW?????

As I recall, that car-split-in-half stunt was pulled on a traffic cop
standing on an island in the middle of an intersection and directing
traffic.

BTW, remember how Herbie won the race in the original &quot;Love Bug&quot; movie?
He split in half crossways, from door jamb to door jamb. The back half
crossed the finish line first, with Buddy Hackett bouncing around in
the back seat. Then the villain in his car (in one piece) came in second,
and finally the front half of Herbie came in third.


It's not Friday, so I'll save the &quot;Split-window&quot; and &quot;Split-windshield&quot;
jokes for later.   :^)
