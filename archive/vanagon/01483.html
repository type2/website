&gt;&gt;once i get the gasket all situated, i get some 3M Heavy Duty Drip Check (in
&gt;Do you get this at a glazier's?

no. at an automotive body shop material supplier (the guy who sells stuff
to the people who fix your dented car). it is Heavy Drip-Chek Sealer,
product number 08531 &lt;looking at the blue box right now&gt;. i think it costs
bout $5 per tube. but it last a long time, and it really works. i've used
it when putting in the side windows, back hatch window, and front windshield,
and even when i put in the power antenna (just a touch for good luck). ;)

&lt;in case anybody doesn't already know, I LIKE 3M stuff ... yeah, it costs
more, but it really really works ... if you will follow the directions. :) &gt;

&gt;I have seen it done with a windshield, so I know what you mean.  The shop
&gt;used jump rope- about 1/4&quot; diameter, and smooth.  Your suggestion of a broom
&gt;handle is an improvement.

yeah, that's the same thing! and the broom handle isn't my original idea. :)
i got that from the HOT VWs article. but it really helps the hands! oh, and
one other thing: do NOT use telephone wire instead of the strong twine ...
did you know that telephone wire (the little grey wiring with four colored
wires inside) can be pulled in two? well it can! :)

just remember, if it ain't going in easy, see if you are not doing something
wrong. and try to pick someone reliable for the outside person ... the first
guy i used dropped the freaking window!!! sheesh!
