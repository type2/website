 &gt; To All:
 &gt; 
 &gt; Last night i Dreamed that i and my family were driving to Albe State 
 &gt; Park (none exists of course but the name was very clear) in our Titan 
 &gt; Red '87 Westy (yup, i Dream in color) when suddenly we came upon a 
 &gt; tanker truck parked cross-wise in the road ahead of us.  I saw it too 
 &gt; late to stop and drove right under it.  Just as we went under the 
 &gt; belly of the truck i was thinking &quot;We're gonna make it!  We'll go 
 &gt; right under.&quot; when we felt the splintering crash of fiberglass 
 &gt; impacting steel.  I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw a snowshower 
 &gt; of fiberglass fibers, twinkling like ice crystals in the air.  
 &gt; 
 &gt; None of this would've happened without you... the thoughts of van 
 &gt; height, horror stories of low underpasses, continual threads on body 
 &gt; repair and painting.  thank you.  i really must find a new group to 
 &gt; hang around with.
