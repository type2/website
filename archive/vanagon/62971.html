It's on the web. Have you checked at
halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/vanagon.html

Under Files
          Propane-Manuals-89-Westy/

Sorry -- permissions were wrong so you couldn't get there before.

If you tried before, try again.  :-(

&gt; Richard Angelini has graciously sent me a detailed procedure for removing
&gt; the unit but I would like to have the official Dometic manual for the
&gt; illustrations and part numbers if required.
