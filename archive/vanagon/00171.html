Subject:       Re: fitting a radio


&gt; I just bought a sony radio/cassette deck for the car (the original vw 
&gt; casette had too much tobacco in it to run anymore).  The mounting is 
&gt; clearly way different.  Is there a standard kit to buy to install 
&gt; something like this, or will I have to manufacture something? It came 
&gt; with almost no hardware, and there are no clips to hold it onto the 
&gt; dash.  The rubber mount in the back is there, and the plate to cover the 
&gt; front, but to support the front, I need some kind of bracket, and I'm not 
&gt; sure what to look for.  Has anyone done this?

Give Crutchfield a call 1-(800) 955-9009. They have all the tech know-
how and the mounting kits that you'd ever need. They don't have a 
power antenna for a Vanagon! There FREE catalog has a lot of tech info 
about after market stereo instalation. 
What model SONY did you get? I think mine is a 7030 pull out type. 
Its about 6 years old now. It eats tapes when its hungry, and the 
right channel blanks out (a good swift slap puts it back to normal)
What I remember it was an almost plug in instalation.
Good Luck.
