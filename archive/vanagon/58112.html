Subject: 84 airflow harness update

Thanks for the many responses!  I now know that the airflow harness
fix (both VW and DIY-capacitor) are for newer Vangons than my 84.
I took all your advice and started pulling on wires.  Gave the ground
strap between cylinder 3 and the wall a good tug...and it ripped!  
Installed a new ground strap and cleaned up the area and the problem 
seems to be solved!  No more stalling!  Thanks again!
