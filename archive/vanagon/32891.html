Like many others, while restoring my '56 sedan I would myself returning to
the same VW dealer. Their support was amazing. One day the boss came over
to the parts counter and said that I could have a 15% discount on all
spares, any time. Pushing my luck, I asked why. His reply was that VAG
couldn't buy the kind of advertising an old restored vehicle represented.
In the end they were even loaning me strange tools with strange numbers.

I dont think you could find much for a 56 sedan at a dealership here.
  Recently, the last year or two, dealers have been catching on to the large
numbers of people interested in restoring older vws, but it is uncommon to
have a dealer involved in a show here, though not, i heard, in Canada.   But
EVERYONE likes and recognizes the vw bug.   why are they so slow?  Im glad
you had such a good experience.
