&gt;&gt; &gt;Last night I was starting to clean up little things on our new '88
&gt;&gt; &gt;Westy &amp; noticed a drop of coolant on the rear heater on/off lever.
&gt;&gt; 

The valve is a separate part from the heater core.  Ther is also a tendancy
for it to leak at the O'ring where the two are joined.  I have also seen a
number of those stupid plastic bleeder screws break (small crack) leaking
coolant all over the place.  Got VW to pay for clean-up in my camper.  BTW, I
replace this screw with fine thread 8mm amd permatex it in place.  Rear seems
to not really need bleeding.  Close front, open rear, rev engine, coolant
will flow.
