Subject: Heating the van (was misc.)
Date: Tue, 30 Aug 94 18:51:48 EDT

On the subject of keeping your van and installing additional heaters etc,
this was covered extensively a while back and you probably have the
correct address by now..Right Lenny?

Any way yesterday I did install one of
the
inline fans from JC Whitney (Canadians beware you WILL pay duty so its not
a great bargain place). The fan appears to be designed for marine
applications and is quite simple for  a 70 dollar piece of merchandise-it
is really a tube with a powerful 12 volt motor and small &quot;turbo-like&quot;
six-bladed fan. It fits nicely in the &quot;cardboard insulated tube&quot; but not
the plastic intake at the point near the vent at the front. You do not
have to cut any tubing if you install at this point, though and thats why
I chose it.. The kit comes with  enough &quot;metal-tape&quot; that it can be easily
joined to both the cardboard tube and the plastic intake. Wrapping
insulation around serves two purposes: a) reducing noise because of the
high pitch of the motor and b) preventing heat loss. There is also a three
speed switch provided as  well as various connectors... I used the hole
provided by the removed silver secret and the 12 volt source therein....
