&gt;A buddy of mine in Phoenix bought a real clean, original  '65 dbl cab in
&gt;August from an old man for $1450.  Put a rebuilt 40 hp.  Sold it for $4,250
&gt;a couple of months later.  He said the buyer came back and told him that
&gt;while driving it a guy in a Porsche chased him down and bought it nearly on
&gt;the spot (allowing usual title transfer procedures etc.)  for $6,000.
&gt;DOH!


Shoulda held out for 8.     :^)
