&gt;&gt;Jason, 
&gt;&gt;Are you using your factory rims?  How much clearance do you have on the inside and outside tire 
well of the rears?   Its hard to believe you got 205's in your rear wheel wells ------maybe I can do the 
same for my westy.

&gt;I have a '73 Sportsmobile that I just threw new sneakers on all the way
&gt;around.  I went to Dunn Tire in Buffalo, NY and had 205/75/15 Kelly
&gt;Safari
&gt;AWR light-truck tires mounted, balanced, valved, with road hazard
&gt;protection
&gt;for $300.  The new rubber works GREAT!  Ride quality is tons better and
&gt;tire
&gt;noise is now a thing of the past.  Also, I think the wider profile has
&gt;given
&gt;me marginally better handling, although this could be my warped
&gt;imagination!
&gt; These tires are mostly for street-driven trucks and are not the huge
&gt;knobby
&gt;clodbustin' tires you see on 4x4's.  Anywho, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND
&gt;these
&gt;tires for anyone looking for good replacement rubber for your Bus,
&gt;Vanagon,
&gt;or Eurovan!
