David Schwarze:

I get out of the office for a day or two and look at what you've done to me!!! :)

(((	ROSE - I swear I didn't volunteer for this one (snik) :)	)))

I have over 50 messages from various addresses similar to the one from John 
Anderson; all with some interest related to the East Coast portion!

I started trying to send individual responses and tried to stay off the VANAGON list 
but It's getting too much to be timely in my responses.

I'm trying to get back up to speed.

I have a meeting for most of this day so can't do too much but will be posting some sort 
of consensus QUICKLY.

For anyone to whom I've missed sending a response, my apologies but &quot;business before 
pleasure&quot;, income is dictated by my appearance of loyalty to the 'establishment' and 
all that other stuff (yes sir, yes sir!!! ... Three bags full ....)

Looks like we gotta a convoy!!!
