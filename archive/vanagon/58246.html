&gt;Hi All,

&gt;I spoke with Weddle Engineering yesterday on the subject of Audi 5
&gt;cylinder bellhousings for Vanagons sold in South Africa.  According to
&gt;them, they are essential the same as the Diesel Bellhousings that can also
&gt;be used for VW gas motors.

I can not follow this. I compared the arrangement of the SA bellhousing
and that one in my Golf TD: the patterns are different. The patterns of the
Vanagon Diesel bellhousing you will find at

http://www.relitech_dot_com/tomc/vanagon.htm

and the patterns of the SA bellhousing at

http://www.relitech_dot_com/helmut/index.html

as soon as I will get back my write rights on this directory. Then you
may check at yourself. But it's nice to find a US source of this 
bellhousings.

&gt;There may be a slight variation, but they said
&gt;the diesel bellhousing will work for an Audi 5 cylinder transplant.  I
&gt;went ahead and ordered their last new South African Belhousing for a
&gt;future project.  8-)  More on this later.

Be proud of this, it's the right one. I think Weddle engineering should
order another bunch of SA parts, bellhousings and engine supports as a
set to convert the powertrain.

&gt;Check out Helmut's website for great info on this type of swap into an 80
&gt;Vanagon camper.  email Helmut for the URL, sorry I don't have it handy...

See the second address above. I just wanted to add chapters about the
engine bay extensions and cooling system, but I have to wait until Tom
will be back.
