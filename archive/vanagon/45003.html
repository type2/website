Subject: vanagon rear hatch loose


The rear hatch on my '87 Syncro GL shakes when I drive on rough roads.

When closed, I can grasp it on either side of the lock and move it in and 
out a little ways.  The noise and the dust it sucks in are unwelcome, and 
the most interesting roads in Alaska are world-class washboard.  

Has anyone adjusted the rear hatch or replaced the latch to remedy this?



Also, yesterday I met a man in his '91 GL with 200,000 miles on it.  He's 
retired, and lives in it, driving from FL to AK every year, seeing 
everything in between.  Custom single bed, dog bed, flyrod rack, pantry, 
cooks over a fire twice a day.  No major repairs, (just water pump and 
clutch and lots of oil changes).  I hope mine, with 72,000 miles on it 
now, serves me as well.

Thanks for any help with the hatch,
