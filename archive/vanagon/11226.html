Subject: Re: westy auxillary battery

&gt;&gt;Has anyone else done this?  Should you use a deep discharge marine type
&gt;&gt;battery for the aux.?  Also, is there a way to figure the amount of time the
&gt;&gt;power will last before aux. battery drains?  Is it worth it, or will lights
&gt;&gt;and radio drain the battery in an hour or so anyway?
&gt;
&gt;I set up twin batteries in the notcback I used to have, to power a 
&gt;monster stereo.  Worked great!
&gt;
&gt;I am thinking about doing something like this in my 56, but with a twist.
&gt;The bus is 6V, and I wanna run a 12V deep cycle for the fridge and
&gt;any other stuff I decide to put in.  What would I have to do to get the
&gt;6V to charge the deep cycle?
&gt;
Thom-
 I guess you don't like the two 6volt batteries in series. 
about the 1 12voly deep cycle-

 You need a voltage doubler circuit (not cheap) or a DC to DC converter(not 
cheap either.)  Or maybe two generators!  You could use two 6-volt or one of 
each- 6 and 12.  I don't think you'll like either of these.  can you get 
deep cycle 6 volt batteries?
