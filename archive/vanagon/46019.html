Subject: Re: 83 Sink's 12V water pump

In regards to John Wakefield's question on self-priming, the outside-the-tank
water pump is installed so that it is at or near the same level as the bottom
of the water tank, so that there is always water going into the pump, even
when off (of course when there's water in the tank).  Still, the rule of
thumb is to monitor the water level in the tank (open the cabinet door on
74-79's or look at the LED panel [if it works] on the 80-91's) to prevent
your pump from running dry.

On the sticker coming with the replacement OE immersible pump, it is flow
rated at 3.3 gallons per minute or 198 gallons per hour.  Other trivial items
on the sticker are 12 Volts _at_ 2.4 Amps.  Since I am at home, I don't have a
outside-the-tank pump to give you specs.

In fairness to Bill Protzek (bprotzek_at_cdsnet_dot_net), I myself would probably
look around to save $$ and would have probably bought the Wal-Mart brand for
my Westy if the case presented itself, but the PO had brand new one sitting
in one of the cabinets, so the point is moot at least in my personal case.  I
guess there's not much difference between 300GPH and 198GPH when ya turn the
faucet on.

But as a business that has to abide by rules of warranty and to offer the
best quality replacements, I'm often constrained to go with, stock and sell
as close to OE specifications for as fair and low priced as possible.  And
most of our world-wide customer base expects (and demands) as close to OE as
possible, whatever the product, based on the phone calls Bill &amp; I get
everyday.  I have accepted for years in the business, long before coming to
Bus Boys that there is the 5% out there who want something for as close to
the lowest dollar possible.  Hell, I'm part of that 5% and it is applied
whenever possible in our purchasing, limited to the rules I've just written.

A good example of this are the Swing Lever Center Pins used on Buses through
1967 on the front beam.  This connects the Drag Link from the Steering Box to
the Tie Rods.  We sell only FEBI/Bilstein German Kits with new bushings,
hardware and pin and current price is about $45 to $50 depending on who you
go through and what the current dollar/mark exchange rate is at the time (I'm
sure there are outfits that are giving these away too for less).  There's an
outfit in Brazil making an almost identical kit that could sell for about
half that price.  Some places out there I know sell them.  I ordered one in
from the local warehouse to check it out.  Remember I said almost identical?
 Well the pin is machined exactly .001&quot; larger than the original.  Which
means if you use the specified reamer tool in the workshop manual on the new
bushings (after installing them), it will be off by that much when trying to
inserting the pin - IT DON'T FIT.  Otherwise, a damn fine quality looking
item (I've got a Brazil Kit sitting on my desk in the office to remind me).
 Note:  They do not make one for the 68-79's, so only German available in
these.

And I will be the first person to tell another buy it elsewhere if it's for
that much less, but only if the quality and expected longevity meets or
exceeds OE specs for what Volkswagen and/or Westfalia originally required.
