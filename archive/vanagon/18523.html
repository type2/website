Subject: Mill Supply Came Through - same part for 1/3 Bus Boys/RMMW

	Some times you just HAVE to laugh! HAAAAAAAA!!! WAAAAA!!!

	For those of you who haven't been following this story, the
part in question is the battery tray for a 1970 single cab pickup-
a slightly different part than the normal Transporter battery tray.

	So I got home last night and there it was on my porch,
the package from Mill Supply. And in it, the same dark-red primered,
30mm too narrow battery shelf that I bought from Bus Boys!!! But
Bus Boys wanted $75 for it and Mill Supply charged me $25!!!!
(Rocky Mountian Motor Works charges $70)

	So I've got a spare, or one to swap or something.

	Both have a tag on them under the reseller's tag which
indicates that TAPCO made the actual part. Anyone know of TAPCO? 
They presumably *really* make this stuff, wonder what their prices
are?

	Anyway, the long wait is over, I'll try and get my neighbor
started on modifying the piece (and take pictures and dimensions)
and get it installed and get on the road already!!

	All that to get the same part?!?! What a goof I feel like!
