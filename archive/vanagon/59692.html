&gt; I would have to ask myself why a vehicle with only 37k needed these parts
&gt; already?

Actually all these are quite reasonable.  Sitting has killed the 
brakes as there was water in the system, tires probably dead about 
this mileage, water pump a bit scary again from inactivity and 
probably lack of coolant changes.  Generally buying such a beast is 
going to still require all the age related maintainence regardless of 
mileage.
