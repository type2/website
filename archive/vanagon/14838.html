&gt; I will NEVER, EVER buy body panels from Wolfsburg West, again!  EVER!
&gt; 
Well, I don't know if they make panels for splits but the company
occasionaly advertising in the mags called Mill Supply makes excellent
bay window panels, on my '76 I found out about them after I had already
ordered a OEM sliding door side rocker for nearly $50 and had fabbed
quite a bit of the rocker and sliding door track support structure from
sheet steel, I obtained the other rocker from Mill Supply and it was a
thing of beauty, fit correctly front to back with the correct
indentations, water drains, etc, double galvanized, held it with a few
rivets then MIG welded it on perfectly, I trimmed a small piece off to
facilitate fitment and it happened to lay outside most of the summer in
the weather, after 3 months the piece had rusted only on the edge I cut,
not on any factory surface, this is why I figure it was galvanized
though it didn't particularly look it, sort of dull grey but not coated
looking, anyway the whole rocker, 8&quot; high by the length of the bus was
about $16, I was very pleased, of course if they make split panels the
fitment could be much worse if they are geeneric to fit many years,
still who knows?
