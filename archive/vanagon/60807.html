Subject: Re: Cellular Phones, temporary!

Actually, if you haven't looked into it, cell phone service is pretty
cheap.  Lots of places will either give you a basic phone or sell you one
for next to nothing.  (Frequently 1 penny at Radio Shack.)  Basic monthly
service in our area is about $17, and cheaper in many urban areas.  Out
here in the big empty of Southeast Arizona, near the New Mexico border,
where it isn't uncommon to drive 50 miles without seeing a building, they
make a lot of sense, and no, I don't work for a cell phone company.

&gt;trustworthy at the time.
&gt;
&gt;Bottom line on my inquiry.  Some of the cellular phone companies will 
&gt;loan you the phone, AT NO CHARGE, other that for paying for the 
&gt;actual calls made.
