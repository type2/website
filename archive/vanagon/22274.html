    Sounds totally normal to me, if we had a third car, my
    SO would definitely drive it before my Transporter (she
    attempts to explain her driving by saying that she grew
    up in Boston).

&gt; My SO needed a car toady (BMW Belly Up Again) so I lent her the 911!  I
&gt; wouldn't have even _thought_ to let her use the bus.  Is this proof I'm going
&gt; insane?
