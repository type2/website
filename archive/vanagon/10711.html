&gt;        When I get the motor into my pick-up (This or next weekend :-) )
&gt;I'm supposed to take it for a smog-check and for a trip to a state

&gt;just wanting to know what their vehicles wiegh.
&gt;        One of the cold-storage warehouses along Old Oakland Road
&gt;has a sign reading &quot;Public Scale&quot;- I'd guess they have a scale certified
&gt;for trade.

Actually, that's in my neighborhood! Another good place to go is the dump.
You take some stuff with you that you want to throw away (you must have
something, or else you wouldn't have bought the truck, right?) and they
weigh you on the way in, and on the way out. The one I go to is on Zanker
Road out past 237 near Milpitas.

Why are they making you weigh your truck? They didn't ask me to. Hmmm.

By the way, Bill, when's the motor party going to be? I assume it's going
to be underwater, right? :-)
