&gt;Mario wrote regarding tires for a syncro

I'll agree with Jim Davis' response.  I also use a LT 27-8.5-14 off road tread
tire (off brand made by Kelly Tires).  I did not sense that the noise level
was much above my earlier reinforced tires.  Do keep good shocks on the van to
keep them from wearing odd.  Then you'll get road noise (I think I'm there
now!!)

If anything the speedo is more accurate now.  Still tends to over indicate
mileage.

The poor road traction is better than the MXL, which I thought were a little
slippery in mud.
