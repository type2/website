Subject: westfalia ? 

If anyone has a few minutes could they give a brief description of the 
vans avaliable in US. Vanagon? Westfalia? Eurovan? CrewCab?
In Australia we receive (broadly speaking) a range of Transporters.
Panel Van (non window),Van(window),Caravelle,SingleCab,DoubleCab (4 Doors),
Tri-Star and the new Transporter (front engine).
Most of our campers are done by a firm called TRAKKA
Just for interest the new Transporter has just been made avaliable
in both singlecab and doublecab (syncro and non-syncro).
