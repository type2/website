&gt; VDO suggests drilling a hole in the sump plate and mounting the sensor
&gt; there.  It would probably make sense to remove the sump plate first, so you
&gt; don't get any metal shavings in the engine.  Some say that the oil sump is
&gt; where the oil in the engine is at its hottest point, though.

I would definately remove the sump plate first.  It's hard enough to drill
the hole in the right place without having to do it with the plate in
the engine.  I have heard the opposite about oil temp, i.e. you get an
artificially low reading in the sump, but it's still a good relative
indicator.  I used such a setup for 4 years before I finally found a
Porsche sump plate with the sender boss mounted in it.  They came on
914 engines.
