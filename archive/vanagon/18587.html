Go there! Participate!  It's lots of fun; meeting the nicest people there
is and getting a kick out of driving in a caravan with like-minded souls.
I highly recommend it. David put in a lot of work organizing this and he
did a great job. C'mon you guys! Take that a couple of days off of work and
join the gang. 

For the trajectory, look for David Schwarze's last post to the list
(Friday, 5/26). If you can, bring a CB radio, too!

I'll be posting more on our trip. But for now, it's time to rest.
