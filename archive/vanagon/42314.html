Subject: 40' Breadloaf Buses, Phoenix  (f)

The local city mass transit type buses have various paint schemes for
various products. One of these babies has an excellent rendition of an
entire loaf of bread as produced by either the Holsum or Rainbow Bread Co.
It looks just like a loaf off of  the shelf but only 40 feet long!  All I
can see is a '50-'63 Panel with the same paint job. Now THAT would be cool!
=). I will try to get a photo of it and include it in the (yet to be
created) VanBondo web page that will happen after the Resto from Hell is in
the bag.

I have an idea for a paint job for the '57 Single that is rattling around in
my head. It would be very appropriate to both VWs and a commercial carrier.
I think I will do up a professional proposal and try to get corporate
underwriting for the next paint job! Paying for it yourself sucks! The
actual concept will be revealed much later and would definitely &quot;mess&quot; them
up at the shows and on the streets. Hee hee. Otherwise I will continue with
the rust and Krylon forever. The concept would definitely let people know
that I am a real serious individual. ;-)  Definitley will do my own body and
paint this (potential) next time and see what I learn. I will probably learn
that you oughta buy a vehicle that doesn't need paint.
