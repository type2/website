&gt;Ralf,
&gt;        No offense to you or Canada, but I think some of your above
&gt;reasons may be slightly exaggerated.


Well David, not to overstate a point, but I'd much rather travle within Can
than the US. I'm originally from the States and often have to go there on
biz, but, give me Can drivers and the real outdoors any day. My wife,
daughter and I traveled across NS,NB, and Quebec this summer. It was
fantastic.
 Nova Scotia is the most beautiful place I've ever lived and provides so
much for recreation, history, and especially quality of life. I've lived
all about the US and no where has come close. This is just an opinion, most
of my family still lives in the states, but understand how tiresome it is
to hear about the states all the time as the greatest and only place you'd
want to go and be. Granted, sometimes parts are scarce, but the fly fishing
is incredible, the music, the coffee at the Trident cafe(Okay, it's run by
Americans), the ocean!! 
Listen, if your trip doesn't include Atlantic Can, then change your plans
and make it up this way.

You gotta see the Cabot Trail
