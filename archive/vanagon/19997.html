_______________________________________________________________________________

I've just stripped the engine from my '71 bus, thought I'd get a gallon 
or two of solvent to put in the bug sprayer, and clean the daylights out 
of everything.  The only place I've found solvent by the gallon was $20 
bucks!!!  Ouch, and WalMart doesn't have it.  Perhaps there's something 
cheaper and almost as 
effective on grease, like Dawn dishwashing liquid?  This is probably OK 
on the shrouding, but how about the inside of the crankcase?  What are 
the tricks and tips on this type of cleaning job?  Also, is there a list 
of Mustdos While the Engines Out? 

   If you're seriously going to try and spray parts dip out of
   a PLASTIC bug sprayer, I hope to God you've got an OSHA approved
   vapor mask -- no kidding, you could do some SERIOUS, SERIOUS
   damage to yourself that way... and that vapor is going to be
   a GENUINE fire hazard!!!
