Subject: HILL PROBLEMS

I just had the clutch, clutch flywheel, throwout bearing replaced and I
can seem to get up steep hills.  I start up the hill from a dead
stop(i.e.-stop light or curvy hill) and the van only goes so far before
its slipping backwards! Its driving me nuts and I can't afford to pay
for a second set of repairs from f-ing the clutch up.  Please give me
advice or personal xperience tips!!

 					thanks,
					   B.
