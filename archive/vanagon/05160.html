Thanks for all the info!

After a lengthy search I was finally able to replace my OME Continental 185
tires with the Michlein MXL 205's. Now I need to know what the correct tire
pressure is. For the 185's VW recommends 39 psi front and 48 psi rear. The 205's
will only hold 40 psi. What pressure should I use?

Please E-mail any suggestions as I do not yet have an Internet connection.

Thanks!
