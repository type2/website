Subject:      Idle problems

I am having a lot of trouble getting my '85 GL (1.9L) to run well.
It just refuses to idle properly.  I have done each of the following
at least twice: (All per Bentley)

Reset the throttle stop to spec (I installed a reman engine)
Set Idle cut-off switch
Replaced and checked: distributor, aux air regulator, temp II sensor,
O2 sensor Checked all sensors and ECU with meter (all checked good)
Adjusted timing (which is a pain if you can't get it to idle stable)
checked vacuum pressure, replace vacuum hoses

The engine will surge at idle from 1500 to 400 rpm, if I can get it
to run.  Every once in a while I can get near a decent setting and
then I tweak it right back to surge ops.

Any ideas (besides &quot;Sell it&quot;, I already get that daily from the wife)
would be greatly appreciated.


P.s. I did get real VW hubcaps and the Van is very proud!
