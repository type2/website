&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;My '85 Westy is blowing the (top)fuse behind the drivers seat alot.  I
&gt;talked w/a guy at a local rv shop who said that running down the short
&gt;takes an average of 10 - 12 hours, which at their shop rate, was going to
&gt;get too expensive.  Is anyone out there aware of a common point where
&gt;shorts occur on this model, or have a suggested methodology for a more
&gt;efficient way to track this down?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Your advice much appreciated!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;
&gt;Ivan,
My first question is: what size fuse are you putting in. Next: what do you
have in the compartment under the driver's seat? There is a small relay
under there that is used for the refridg when running it at 12 volts. I
would start there as it's the most vulnerable.
