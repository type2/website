Subject: Instrument Illumination

     I would like to start out by saying that I am both new to posting and 
     to my Vanagon.
     
     Now the problem......
     
     I have no instrument lights. Where I do have light are with the 
     cigarette lighter, and hazard switch. I did manage to pull of the 
     cover for the instrument cluster and look and the lights, they 
     appeared to be intact. What should I look for or do here?
     
     I also am confused about my refrigerator, I plugged it into the 
     external AC and nothing happened. I reviewed the instructions and sure 
     enough I had followed them correctly. I went out later and heard what 
     sounded like the water pump. I shut everything off disconnected the AC 
     and then started it up. The battery light and the OXS light came on 
     and remeained on for ~5minutes. Again, What should I look for or do 
     here?
     
     
     I thank you for any help
     
     Mark
