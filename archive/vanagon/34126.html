Subject: '70 Bus - Is this a good deal???

Hi Volks - 

	Well, here goes. I'm about to dive (bellyflop??) back into the
world of VeeDubb vans.~~~~~\\!! KERSPLASH!!//~~~~~~~~~~

	My family bought a '68 Westy new. Picked it up in London and drove
it all around Europe for 3 1/2 months. Shipped it back and we drove
it all around the U.S., Canada, Mexico, California (where I
live)...if it could swim we would have driven it to Hawaii. Ahhh-what
good times.....

	I inherited it in '82 and from then until '87 I drove it, camped in
it, made love in it, and used it to haul everything from drywall to
paper-mache clown heads. Through it all it was a sturdy, elegant, and
loyal little vehicle. 

	In '87 I decided I should give it a rebirth and tore it apart
intending to rebuild it. Well.........you know how it is, girlfriends
become wives and jobs become careers. Spare time becomes very spare
indeed. It still sits at the point where a lot of projects like this
sit, where there is nothing left to take apart and the only thing
left to do is put it back together.

	Lately,  I've found myself noticing VW buses more (older ones of
course, I'm stuck in a time warp as far as that goes). I like
watching them make jerky sideways  movements in the wind, and seeing
their drivers in that characteristic
semi-slouch-forearms-resting-on-the-steering-wheel driving
position...AND THAT PINGING IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD WILL NOT GO AWAY,
no matter what octane coffee I drink or how good my timing  is.

	I've been lurking around this list for a while and I know what my
problem is.  I've become a &quot;Wannabus&quot;....  and I know my '68 memory
is not going to be on the road any time soon. Which, finally, leads
me to the whole point of this post.

	I've found a '70 bus and since I've seen that the collective
expertise on this list could put good ol' Herr Porsche to shame, I'm
hoping I could get some comments.  The bus (I'm told-I haven't seen
it yet) has 73k miles, one owner, clean interior, straight body, good
paint, no rust (that I've gotta see), decent engine (I've already got
two of those, one is in pieces), good tranny (I've got one of those
too) and I forget what else.     Price $2,000.00

	I'm going to look at it this Sunday. What do y'all think. If it
lives up to its hype should I jump on it? Is the price fair or
should I haggle ? (I'm a lousy haggler - but don't tell anyone). 

	If you've read this far thanks, and if you want to give me any
advice, thanks in advance.
