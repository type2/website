I know I am a little behind on my mail but here goes...  Doesn't Gene 
Berg recommend the Fram HP-1 as the only filter he uses?  He says that
it is the only one that has never blown off the motor.  Seems all 
others he tried did this at one time or another.  Is the HP-1 a 
special high pressure filter?  I would guess that.  Is that what those
Porches were using Tim?  I don't want to start a fight here about 
Berg, etc.  It's just that I have taken to moonlighting in an attempt 
to save some money for a new motor for my '71 and I am reading all the
Berg stuff.  Even if I don't end up with one of his motors I will be 
a better educated, blah blah.  Didn't mean to start babbling.  I just 
have a soft spot for a guy with an ego like that.  Not the kind of guy
I would drink beer with on a regular basis but I sure would like to 
have some of those years of research pushing me down the road.  :)
