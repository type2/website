Subject: Re: reduction gears

Jon, thanks again for the info...I took the day off to see if I could get
to the bottom of the noise (which mysteriously disappeared the next day).
I knew that the fluids in both reductn gears and tranny should be changed.
I didn't know when the last time they'd been changed and it was one of those
maintainence things on the list.  I drained the fluid in both (one nut on
the top took a good deal of effort and patience - it was worn slightly so
a snug fit with the allen wrench was lacking) reduction gears.  Fluid was 
black but still had lubricative (?) properties.  Top gears looked GREAT! 
No metal filings in oil - some metal dust tho.  Refilled with Amalie 85-
90 Hypoid.  Next the transaxle.  It was low about 1/2-1&quot; (estimated by
finger into filler hole.  Drained and found metal filings on both magnetic
drain caps - metal looked old except one curly-cue piece about an 1/8&quot; in
diameter.  I'll look for a spare tranny.  Refilled with new 85-90 oil. 
Used a $3.99 hand pump (about 20 mL per stroke).  Test drive- everthing
appears norml.  Have yet to take foo out on the turnpike.   

Thanks much everyone.
