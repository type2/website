&gt; J.C. Whitney sells a solar powered charger for $35 that they describe as
&gt; having a max current output of .05 amps and 12.2 volts. Is that worthless 
or
&gt; could it actually keep a van battery charged that was otherwise being used
&gt; for radio and interior lights while camping?

It's worthless.  That's only 50ma - barely enough to keep your battery
topped off when there is *no* load on it.

&gt;                                                                             

                  They also have a heavy duty
&gt; version at 13.2 volts; would that make any difference?

Nope.  The amp rating is what's important.  They should all have
adequate voltage to charge the battery.  To make up for lights and
radio, I would think you would need a panel with an output close to 1
amp, assuming the lights were being used intermittantly, and even then,
you would need a lot of hours of sunlight.
&gt;
&gt; In that same vein, would it be safe to rely on the battery indicator panel
&gt; where yellow indicates you still have starting power? Both questions 
assume
&gt; spring/summer conditions and not this -48 business the Minnesotans are
&gt; enjoying now.

I wouldn't rely on it.  I don't know at what voltage the light changes
from yellow to red, but I bet it's below 12 volts, at which point I
doubt the battery would start your car.  Your best bet is to get a good
voltmeter, or a second battery.
