Subject: Re: Thanks (re: profiting...) / BITE ME!


&gt;  
&gt; Poor Ron, thought the whole list picking on him, but now he feels 
&gt; uplifted. 
&gt; Took it personally, a sensitive misunderstood guy. 
&gt; BITE ME! I repeat BITE ME! 
&gt;  

if i could bite you I would.  Go outside, look around, GET A LIFE!

anyone who cares so much about this to write that looooong a reply
obviously has bigger problems.

ps - never bought a thing from ron, nor have i been offended by a single post 
of his (can't say the same for you)

pps - i reserve the right to post abusive email sent to me to public forums.
