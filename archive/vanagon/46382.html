&gt; While I was there I
&gt;spotted another Vanagon with some type of spoiler mounted under the
&gt;front bumper. It looked like a factory item. Does anyone know if this
&gt;was a factory item?

In the USA this air dam on the front of Vanagons first appeared on the 1987
Vanagon GL Wolfsburg Edition and has been on most Vanagons since - all with
the fiberglass bumpers.  The base van models on 1990 &amp; 1990 returned to the
steel bumbers and lacked the front air dam.
