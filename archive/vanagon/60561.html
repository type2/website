Subject: Re: unplug '86 idle stabilizer?

I was having problems with the idle stabilizer on my 85. (engine cutting
 out).
 
 Since they wanted $200 for a new one and I was running fine (except for
 having to run the idle faster) I cut the 5oz plastic box open.
 
 I had a whole $7.00 worth of parts inside. I took the shotgun approach
 and replaced every thing and it works fine now.
