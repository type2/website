Subject: Re: What about Custom Handbook by Meredith?

&gt;From: Gilbert Christopher L &lt;3clg4_at_qlink.queensu_dot_ca&gt;:
&gt;bookstore in town that carries Volksworld magazine from the UK.  I have
&gt;ordered the VW Bus Custom Handbook by Lawrence Meredith as well.  Any
&gt;negative comments?  I can cancel my order up until Friday...  Please

I picked up a copy last week while in Detroit.  High British content, 
but otherwise a good, useful book :-)  Lots of neat bus pix.  I haven't 
read it yet, but technical content is quite condensed, so this book 
should be considered an adjunct to the Muir and Bentley manuals in your 
collection.  Has a nice section on treating rust -- I'll have to memorize 
that part.
