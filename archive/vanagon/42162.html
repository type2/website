&gt; The question is: If your antenna is single mount on the side then how much
&gt; does it interfer with the operation of the window? Did you or would you
&gt; recommend the double 90 degree clooged work around or not.

Since I will be putting safaris on the '56 in the near future, I am
also faced with this.  I was s'posed to be trading my normal antenna
for the 90 degree one, but the bus that the antenna was on got stolen,
so I'm out in the cold.

I'm also looking for the special wiper jobbers to go with the 
safaris, the ones that &quot;disconnect&quot; the wipers when not in use.
