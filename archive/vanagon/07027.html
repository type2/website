Subject: Early Westfalia Tent WWW Page Up!

clark/mail/postponed-mail/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

I've got an early version (no .gifs yet!) of a longish description of 
Westfalia accessory tents up and would really appreciate feedback, both 
on content and format.  Please be kind: I'm using a 286 PC to compose and 
can only view the results on Lynx.  I plan to scan in some pix soon to 
augment the narrative description.

Open the URL in my .sig and then look for the tents link on my homepage.

Thanks!

Joe
