&gt; Date: Thursday, 10 October, 1996 9:00 AM
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell me how to remove/reinstall the armrests in my 
&gt; 87'.  It appears that the PO allowed three of them to fall off and then 
&gt; just stashed them under the jump seat.  It also looks like I might have
a 
&gt; few stripped allen screws to replace.  I don't know if there is a
special 
&gt; tool I need to get or what.  Thanks in advance.

The brackets are held to the seats with allen head bolts.  The armrests
are held to the brackets by a roll pin that' s in there TIGHT.  Drive out
the roll pin, reinstall the bracket, put the armrest back on the bracket
and finally drive in the roll pin.


hope this helps
