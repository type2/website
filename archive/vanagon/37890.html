Subject: FS 82 Westy diesel

Hi listmembers,

I'm back. Some of you will remember the questions that I had last year 
about diesels and air-conditioning (living in Dallas and having become 
father of twin girls last June).

The girls are the main reason why I am finally thinking about selling the 
westy before the summer. Here goes:

82 Westfalia diesel, beige

101k miles

Excellent condition, no rust, only dent is on front bumper under license 
plate (so it's not visible). Neighbors think it's only a few years old.

Everything works (even the gas fridge).

5 new tires (Continental), 1500 miles old.

All new hoses in Summer 93.

Remanufactured cylinder head, new injectors, new glow plugs in January 95 
(at 96k miles). All new belts.

New starter (Fall 95)

Invested about $3000 since January 95 (tires, cylinder head, injectors, 
glow plugs, starter). Have all receipts.

Right now, the diesel pump has a very slow leak but I am going to have 
that fixed. The van will have a new Bosch diesel pump when I sell it.

Asking: $4800/neg

Without the new diesel pump: $3800

Please e-mail me directly (jrieger_at_mail.smu_dot_edu),

Joerg



P.S.:
Some listmembers (David Schwarze, Dean Aukes) have seen the van.
