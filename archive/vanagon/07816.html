Subject: Temporary rust fix advice

I know rust has been covered here in the past.  I thought I would pass
along what I was planning for my bus and see if there is anything I am
missing.  I have only a very small amount surface rust under my bus so
that is not the problem at the moment.  I do have rust in front of one
wheel well and back by the battery tray that has made its way through 
the metal.  Further down the road these panels will be repaired or
replaced but for now I just want to stop it where it is.  Looks are 
not that important to me right now.  If you have to find something 
positive to say about it at least rust is a good theft deterent.  So, 
I was thinking I would sand out the rust as much as possible and swab 
on some of this POR-15.  It is my understanding that this will stop 
rust in its tracks.  If I decide to get crazy I might paint over this 
to pretty it up a little.  Again, mostly I just want to stop the rust 
where it is and worry about replacing or repairing panels in the 
future.  So, assuming this is the way to go, these are my questions:

1.  What type and grit of sandpaper will work best to clean up the 
edges of the couple of holes and take off the larger areas
of surface rust?

2.  These POR-15 people sell something that is supposed to clean up 
the rusted area and prep it a little better for the application of the
POR-15 stuff itself.  Will this really be needed since I will be 
sanding out the rust?

Thanks for your help.  Jim
