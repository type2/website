&gt;Did anyone realize that there are 5 generations (that is, if you consider the
&gt;Eurovans, [a.k.a. T4] and barndoors [pre '55 Splitties])?  We have photos of
&gt;all five generations together that we took at the last Bad Camberg meet in '91.
well .... TECHNICALLY, there are only 4 ...
T1 which is 1949 to 1967,
T2 which is 1968 to 1979,
T3 which is 1980 to 1991,
T4 which is 1991 to whenever

at least, that's what all the literature says about what vw themselves called
&quot;generations&quot; of transporters. and even all those years are just the u.s.
model years, not the calendar year when the changes appeared in germany.

i guess it all has to do with the front facia ... all splits are considered
the same generation, no matter what their rear ends look like. and that sorta
makes sense ... since the 1968 rear end is almost identical to the 1967
(split-window) rear end.

it was always neat to me how the vanagon and the split-windows could be so
many years apart, and look so different, and yet be the same basic design.
