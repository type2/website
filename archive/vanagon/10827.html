Subject: VW Collection Sale story...

Mary told a tale of wanting to use the '57 Panel to move some sheep from
her farm to ... somewhere.  It wouldn't run.  She took the seats out of a
Beetle, hooked it on a towbar, put four live sheep in it and towed it from
point A to point B.  Deliberately drove slow to give passers-by a good
chance to look at the occupants, who were quite curious and poking their
heads out of the windows.
