%mbates_at_s3.sonnet_dot_com inquired:

%The engine has a case number of B5XXXXXXXX  Can anyone identify that for
%me?  Is this a Brazilian Bug block?  The lid did say it had been rebuilt
%13k ago but it sounded kinda rough.  It kept dying at first and then he got
%it to idle but I was a bit uneasy about it.

%I await your comments.  Again it is a 1968 for $550

%-Marlin

The Muir Table shows all transporters from August '67 (production date, 
thus the 1968 model year) through July '70 as having a B 5 xxx xxx motor.  
So it should be a German motor.  I dunno, $550 sounds pretty good to me.
