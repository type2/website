My '87 GL was acting like yours a few years ago. There is a large
power resistor behind the left headlight than had burned out. It is
apparently used to drop some voltage to produce the lower speeds of
the radiator fan. As I recall, it wasn't as expensive as I though it
would be. Around $30.00 from the VW dealer?
