Subject: Re: westy rollover angle 

When four wheeling in my 90 syncro westy I get real nervous when the vehicle
is listing 15 degrees one way or the other. When the vehicle is listing 20
degrees one way or the other I freak out, get out of the car, and put stones
under the car so it will not go any further than 20 degrees.

Does anybody think I am too paranoid. I don't know how I can figure out the
real rollover angle of my car short of buying a big pile of mattresses and
pushing it over.
