&quot;Mr.&quot; Hooper said:
&gt;A barndoor is &lt;snip&gt; powered by a 3.5 hp Briggs &amp;
&gt;Stratton lawn-mower engine which was cooled by shoveling Teutonic on  it
during frequent rest breaks. This is a problem for certain restorers in
Phoenix where there is little snow, but barndoor impressarios are never
daunted...

Some restorers in Phoenix resort to drinking too much beer due to the
excessive desert heat. This eventually provides an alternative cooling off
method for hot engines. At least it's a dry heat! We reserve the shovel for
pitching the bull.  ;-)
