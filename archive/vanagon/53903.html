Subject: Harbor Freight On Line

It occurs to me I don't know if anyone has mentioned that like
Kelly, Harbor Freight Tools is now online in a major way as well with 
an automated catalog.  Most excellent, my favorite pick is the 3/4&quot; 
drive socket set for still about $40, no serious VW owner should be 
without one.  Most stuff is OK generally the price denotes the 
quality their &quot;pro grade&quot; stuff is as a rule probably as strong but 
not as nicely finished as Craftsman (which is not very nice these 
days either) still $25 for a set of Chinese combination wrenches up 
to 32mm is unbeatable, go price one single Craftman wrench over 19mm 
if you don't believe me, use the stuff once and it will pay for 
itself, say like on that 24mm upper ball joint nut on a Vanagon only 
accessible with a wrench, not a socket.

Anyway at
