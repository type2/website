Subject: hiroof breadloaf FS in NJ

Friend/proprietor of shop here in North Jersey is either selling or parting
out a hiroof camper.  I looked at it quickly this morning.  Surface rust
and perforated rockers.  74? body, auto trans, interior looked complete
but I didn't look closely for condition.  Fiberglas hiroof with windows
on sides and a vent on top.  Act fast if you're interested 'cause he has
a tentative taker for the roof alone.  Rory at 201-489-7828.

He's also got a nice blue Syncro with air, and an 82 that runs but doesn't
look that great.  Also w/air.

Rory and I were measuring the Syncro's engine bay to see if a V8 would fit;
look in the index under acetylene torch.
