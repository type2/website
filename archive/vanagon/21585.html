I would have liked to post this to vintagvw as well but they are 
getting a little a testy over there right now.  Anyway, yell at me if 
you want.  It is kind of VW related.

About six months or more ago I went to a VW repair place here in town 
and asked the guy if he was doing any hiring.  He said to check back 
in the spring when things picked up.  This went on with me going in 
about every 2-4 weeks since May and each time he told me to check 
back.  I told him I knew a little bit about one '71 bus but could 
learn the rest.  I figured I could change oil and to tuneups and leave
him to the big important stuff.  He thought that sounded like a good 
idea but come back in two weeks, etc.

So, today I checked the calander and road my bike down there again.  
He stood around a little more and said he really didn't have any 
mechanicing that needed done.  It turns out he is pretty much a one 
man operation.  He did, however, just move into this building about a 
year ago so has piles of parts and stuff everywhere.  He asked me if I
knew the VW part numbering system.  I said that somewhere I had a 
complete list of how it works.  I do, thanks to a certain VW 
encyclopedia I know in Alabama.  Then he asks if I know anything about
getting things organized.  Well, I am a librarian when my hands are 
clean.  So we had a match.  I start in two weeks.  Just Saturdays for
now, then some afternoons if I can get out of here early enough.  Who 
woulda thunk it.  My foot is in the proverbial door.  Thanks for your 
time.  I just had to tell someone.  Jim
