     For some strange reason I got a Columbus Dispatch today, and since 
Saturday is the paper with all the car adds I thought I'd take a look.  
Lo and behold (mis-spellings and all):

     '87 VW Westsalia camper/van gray, pop-up top, kitchen $5600.
     Call (614) 224-6207 or 860-0620

     Standard disclaimers apply, this is not my van, call them, don't 
email me. yadda, yadda, yadda.


     Schedule permitting, I may be able to look at it for you.
