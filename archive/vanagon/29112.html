&gt;$11 well spent.  Anybody else use this stuff?

Well thought of in Porsche list, well endorsed.  You had water in the gas, 
serious amounts of it too.  Passing water through the injectors sure 
quenches any fire in the combustion chamber fast, as you know!  This is 
especially bad in spring or fall at cheap stations that let their tanks get 
low. Condensation inside the tank results from that nice cool gasoline/metal 
sucking in the hot moist air outside.  Desert has similar hot/cold swings I 
understand. Regular old methanol will fix this nicely BTW, but Techron does 
way better. It's normal around here to throw in gas line de-icer in every 
tank in winter to counter the other nasty side effect of this, a dead fuel 
pump or ice bound filter.  Tim Smith
