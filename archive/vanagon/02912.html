Subject: front coils &amp; cruise control

Greetings:

I'm new here so wanted to say hi and see if anyone might have any
experience changing out the front coils on a Vanagon. I've got an '85
Vanagon camper that sits with its nose in the air, an inch or two
higher than its rear. I've heard that it was a common problem and that
the factory installed the wrong coils on some of them. I've heard that
all you have to do is measure the coil's diameter and get the correct
ones from the dealer. Anyone know about this and are they
difficult/tricky to replace? And ,do you need any special tools?

Also, maybe it's been discussed before but I also wanted to offer my
experiences on installing an after-market cruise control on my vanagon
to anyone who might be interested.


cheers,
jt
