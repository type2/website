&gt; &gt; The Twentynine Palms area is quite doable from Tucson, maybe even a little
&gt; &gt; further north...  Anybody know anything about Providence Mountains State
&gt; &gt; Recreation area (off I-40 between Barstow and the AZ border)?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; That's pretty desolate country -- I haven't been north of I-40 along
&gt; that stretch, but I've been to Amboy, which is south of I-40 between
&gt; Ludlow and Twentynine Palms. Nice volcano!

Providence Mountains State Rec. Area has a campground near a cool spot called 
Mitchell Caverns (open all winter) which is a little exposed and kind of a 
parking lot; not the greatest place to camp.  However, nearby in the East Mojave
Scenic Area are 2 good places called Mid-Hills and Hole-in-the-Wall which are 
nice, and cheaper ($7 per night as opposed ~$20).  Also, you are only a short 
hop from Kelso Dunes (very big), which rumble when you slide down them.  Check 
out Tom Steinstra's California Camping Guide for more details or e-mail me if 
you have any specific questions.  It is quite a drive from anywhere but Barstow.
