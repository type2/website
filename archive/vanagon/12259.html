Subject: What about Custom Handbook by Meredith?

I have heard all kinds of great stuff about Muir's manual and I've been
searching high and low for a copy.  I was resigned to special order, when
I managed to stumble on a 25th anniversary edition copy in the only
bookstore in town that carries Volksworld magazine from the UK.  I have
ordered the VW Bus Custom Handbook by Lawrence Meredith as well.  Any
negative comments?  I can cancel my order up until Friday...  Please
advise fellow 'Brick' drivers. 

P.S. I've heard a lot about the Nov. 1994 Volksworld Vanagon special 
issue.  Is it worth the money to order a back issue?  We're talkin better 
part of $10...at least. Ulp!
