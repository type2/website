Subject: Camper Wanted

Mail*Link¨ Remote             Camper Wanted
Hi- I am new to the list but eager to find a camper.  I have read the FAQ list
from rec.auto.vw but could still use advise on were (in particular) to look for
rust when evaluating a potential purchase and what mechanicals (if any) are
notoriuos for going bad and needing replacment.
Also-what experiences do people have as using a camper as a daily commuter?  My
wife has a reliable car so we can handle occassional problems (and I have driven
a somewhat temperamental'76 BMW 2002 for the last 4 years so I am used to
occassional problems).  My commute is less than 10 miles so I will not be
abusing it but I would like to take my 2002 off the road for an engine rebuild
and need transportation of my own.
Any campers for sale?  Any comments about commuting? 


Thanks for you help,
Thomas J. Cook
