Steve and the List,

While there is a special tool for setting the gear selectors, a perfectly
suitable substitute may be fabricated from an old transmission.

When a transmission cracks across the differential housing, or pounds out the
pinon bearing web, its life is over.  Junkies an tranny rebuilders get rid of
them cheep.  Folks use them to build dynos or engine stands or send them to
Martha as BBQ fuel.  

Since the function of the special tool used to set the gear selector position
is to hold the two gear shafts in the same relationship as when mounted in
the transmission, you may use an old, damaged transmission to do exactly
that.  The only modification needed is to cut a window in the side of the
tranny so you can see &amp; adjust the gear selector forks.  And since such a
window is at the opposite end of the casting from the bell housing, you can
use the same junked tranny as an engine test stand  AND a transmission repair
fixture.

-Bob
