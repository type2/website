Subject: For Sale 1978 VW Bus 2.0fi

The bus you can take to Woodstock II this August !!
Let me list the reasons to buy:
Priced right $ 1100.00 .
Great engine. (always starts, smooth and reliable.)
Great body. ( 1 year old paint red bottom white top -
             just minor cosmetics under the paint.)
Good tires. (they have at least a couple more years to go.)
Good brakes. (no noises, no pedal pumping.)
Good suspension. (bus sits level, no torsion adjustment needed.)
Good interior. (no rips, new auto carpet, nice door panels, -
                 nice dash, center seat removed hinge up -
                 table installed, privacy curtains, rear -
                 seat folds down for bed.)
Good stereo. (optimus pullout cd/stereo four speaker.)
Air conditioning. (complete VW bus unit installed, pump and hoses -
                    need to be hooked back up.)
Good exhaust. (no headaches here, heat exchangers removed, system -
                is leak-free and quiet.)
Auxiliary heater. (gas heater original to bus, currently removed -
                    can be re-installed easily.)
Good steering. (nice and tight, straight on the road, no pulling -
                no front tire wear, good stabilizer.)

Thats about it , its great for camping and overnight trips not
    to mention those trips when you dont go very far but couldn't
    drive home if your life depended on it. (which it probably
    does anyway)
       Call Joe in So. Portland Maine at 207-767-2292 after 6:30.
       Bought a new truck, starting a business, bus has to go.
       The price is a bargain for whoever buys it so thats pretty
       solid.   Pass it on.
