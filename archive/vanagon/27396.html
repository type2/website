Subject: '67 Samba for sale

I noticed that the blue '67 Samba in town has a for sale
sign in the window.  The sign says $6,500.  The exterior
and interior are complete and in very good condition (really).
Anyone interested it's in Costa Mesa at the Midas brake
shop near Newport and 20th.      Wannabussers interested?
