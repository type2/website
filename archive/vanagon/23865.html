Subject: Re: Heat Tabs 



To All:

There is a variety of passive heat sensors available.  Some are in liquid
form and my be painted on the surface, others are applied like chalk or
crayon.  Those for refractory temps are usually ceramic, those for lower
temps are usually a metal alloy, the ones used at the lowest temps are waxes.
 All work on the same principle; above a temperature as determined by the
alloy of the indicator, the stuff will change its state.

The heat tabs mentioned in Lisa's post appear to be stick-on mid-range
temperature sensors, probably using a bismuth alloy.  These are often used
when running-in an expensive engine or complex transmission, allowing the
builder to monitor temperature at several locations without having to install
thermocouples and instrumentation.

Heat Tabs, Temp-L Sticks, slump-cones and the like can usually be obtained
from a welding supply house.  The better automotive suppliers carry those
suitable for engine temps.
