Subject: Trade for my Deluxe???

 Howdy
As you perhaps recall, I was recently elated by my purchase of a '66
Sunroof Deluxe, as it had new mechanical *everything*. Well, since then,
I have realized that realistically, I do not need three busses, but I
could use something practical, like a truck. Having always had a passion
for double cabs, I would prefer one of those but would consider a single
cab. Soon would be nice, as I have to move out by the end of this month,
and have some large things that will not fit in a bus.
    Here is my offer:
I will trade an ugly but super-running deluxe for a crew cab, or, failing
that, a single cab. While I would prefer it to be also running-but-ugly,
I will consider partial trades (as in no engine). I would prefer a later
split window, but would certainly be happy with an earlier one, or even
possibly a pre-72 late model. Obviously, the closer to NC the better,
but if yours is drivable, we could meet somewhere. Anyway, hopefully
someone would be interested...
Oh, low milage, late model Vanagon Westfalias might also be considered.
