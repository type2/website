&gt;Rhode Gear             model 'Super Shuttle'   $90
&gt;   fits all vehicles (that's the claim, anyway).
&gt;   for Vanagons it's great!

OK, I've got one of these, fits all CARS yes, major fight to get it on the 
Vanagon. ALL the weight is held by two tiedown straps if it's high up on 
rear hatch, bikes too low if it sits on front or rear bumper. Anything less 
than 6&quot; ground clearance is too low IMHO. I am tempted to drill/mount it on 
the rear hatch permanently, that would do best. Got the thing slightly used 
for $6.00 in an LLBeans garage sale. tim s.
