Subject: '71 Bus sliding roof - - Trouble??

	I'm going to look at a '71 bus this weekend. (Maybe this is the 
one!) It has a sliding roof.

	Does anyone have anything bad or good to say about sliding roofs?
Do they cause problems?  I'm concerned that this could be a source
of leaks and/or aggravation.  Or, are they like the rest of the car, 
basically well-designed and well-made, and no real trouble if you 
take care of it?

	Thanks a ton for all the advice I've been getting!
