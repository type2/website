&gt; They also have an address in the the USA in Orlando, Florida where they
&gt; manufacture awnings. I don't know if they sell the bike racks over there
&gt; but it might be worth a call. If you go to
&gt; &lt;http://www.rvamerica_dot_com/fiamma/index.html&gt; you can find all the relevant
&gt; contact details.

Regarding awnings, anyone knows the best way to go with these? Are they
really useful? Is there a specific Vanagon-awning manufacturer? Prices?
So many questions, so little time...
