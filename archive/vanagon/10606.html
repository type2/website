Subject: VW-88 VANAGON GL-SLIDING DOOR OPENS (AT THE WRONG TIME)
Date: Wed, 25 Jan 95 12:19:00 PST
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

I'm posting this question for my buddy with his 88 GL Vanagon with
electric door locks (my '71 Bus don't need no stinkin' bells and
whistles).  Whenever it is cold (ski area cold) or really wet, and he is
using the auto door lock, his rear sliding door can suddenly come open
while driving.  While this can have a positive effect on increasing air
circulation, it can be a bit unnerving to the average rear passenger.
He's tried cleaning the electrical contacts, greasing the locks, etc., but
nothing seems to cure it.  Any suggestions?

This is why I'm happy I don't have a Bus with all these fancy gizmos.  Of
course, I can't lock or unlock the drivers door from the outside, I can't
open the passenger door from the inside, and you have to slam your
shoulder into the rear sliding door to get it open, but I concider these
things to be optional features rather than irritating problems.  For
example, they can be the equivalent of dental records for a decomposed
body: if someone steals my Bus, completely fixes all the exterior damage
and rust, repairs the sliding roof so it wouldn't need the tarp when it
rained, gives it a new paint job, and replaces all the plates and VIN
tags, I could still identify it by the glitches with the door and lock
system.  What an advantage!  And at no additional cost too!

Nick
