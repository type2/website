Subject: '78 Owner's Manual ready to go!
Date: Thu, 20 Mar 97 20:47:57 EST

Hey all,
Thanks to James McGill, the 1978 VW Type 2 owner's manual that I scanned
over the summer is now ready for access. 

You have two choices:  James has unzipped the file I sent him and has an
index of all the image files which can be accessed depending on what you
are looking for (look at the contents files first) OR you can download
the whole ZIP file from the FTP site.

For some reason, I did not scan pages 80, 82, and 83.  Perhaps they were
blank or perhaps I had a brain fart.  I don't remember why I didn't scan
them as the scanning was done last summer.  But all the important stuff
is there I believe.

BTW, for anyone in the US who still believes VW recommended 91 octane
gasoline for their vehicles, please visit page 26 and that should dispel
that myth.  Be sure to read the whole thing.  Be aware that the US uses
the CLC rating method for octane numbers.

OK, the address for viewing the individual pages is:

	http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manual

and the FTP address to download the entire zip file (5 megabytes) is:

	ftp://ftp.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manual.zip

Have fun!

Sean
