Thought I'd add my .02:

 &gt; 
 &gt; Electric Cars are being touted as THE alternative to the internal
 &gt; combustion engined vehicles we are all driving now. Yep, these
 &gt; cars themselves don't pollute.....but the generating plants
 &gt; that develop the power to re-charge these vehicles do!

Yes, but the generating plants, even the worst kind, running diesel
generators, are running these at the top efficiency levels, while a
car's engine  is hardly ever run at the top of its efficiency, except
at highway speeds.  The losses from the delivery of electrical power
to the vehicle during charging, storage in the vehicle (batteries),
and conversion to kinetic energy (motor), are less than 25%, which
means that the overall pollution will be less under certain
circumstances. 

Another plus for the electric vehicle: In high traffic areas, the
vehicle does not use any power at standstill -- and traffic jams are
some of the biggest contributors to environmental pollution.

Another plus: most electric cars I've seen come with re-generative
braking options (essentially uses the elecric motor to charge the
battery during  deceleration), re-capturing a fraction of the energy
used up in accelerating the car).

A negative: with today's technology, you need to haul the mass of an
incredible amount of batteries (accelerating that mass requires so
much more power, hence energy) to have some reasonable range between
charging. 

So here's the dilemma:  the more energy and pollution efficient an
electric car, the less usable it is (less range, less acceleration,
lower top speed).

Some manufacturers have the solution (IMHO):  turbo-diesel assisted
electric vehicles (Concept 1 was proposed with such an engine -- I
have not followed up).  These still have the advantages of all
electric cars, since the assisting engine is run at optimum
performance, and they do not have to carry an incredible mass of
batteries to get some reasonable range, just enough to act as power
'capacitors' (effectively, that's what they'd be), to deliver the
extra juice when needed, and to store it when the assisting engine is
delivering more juice than needed.

I have yet to see where the EPA people had their heads stuck in when
they put the 0 emissions rules in effect, especially when they had a
really workable alternative.  It seems that the 0 emission rules are
self-defeating; people just will not use them.



 &gt; 
 &gt; To convert to having a majority of electric vehicles is going
 &gt; to mean a major increase in the generating capacity of this
 &gt; country. That means new generating plants....more use of
 &gt; either fossil or nuclear fuels. Couple that with the idea

Although I agree with you in general, this argument is not correct.
One way or another one must convert the stored energy in the fossil
fuel to kinetic energy.  Cars do this in one shot : stored -&gt; kinetic
energy.  The electric powered cars take a detour:
stored-&gt;kinetic-&gt;electric-&gt; stored_electric -&gt; kinetic.
Now, electrical generation via conventional methods is as efficent as
the diesel running it (I understand the generators generally run at
90-95% efficiency).  You do lose some during delivery and you do lose
some in the battery, since you never get as much energy out of the
battery as you put in it as charge.  You also use extra energy to
accelerate the mass of the battery that you are carrying, in addition
to your power plant.

 &gt; that electrical generation under conventional methods is
 &gt; not all that mechanically efficient...and, by the way, neither
 &gt; is recharging batteries. So there is a double whammy effect
 &gt; here.

 &gt; 
 &gt; If we are going to have alternative power sources for our cars,
 &gt; I don't believe &quot;plug in&quot; electrical vehicles are a long term
 &gt; answer....a technology such as fuel-cell or solar cell is...

Agreed, but that may not be as easy to achieve as a TD-assisted
electric.

 &gt; but as Bob said in his first posting, big industry decides
 &gt; what is good for us. And what bigger industry is there than
 &gt; the power industry!
 &gt; 
 &gt; IMHO,
