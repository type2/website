&gt;&gt; Also, the engine could suck false air there, giving you the
&gt;&gt; stalling idle you mentioned.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know what this means, could you please elaborate?

ah, my language again :) ,i tried to translate a local expression,
never mind, what i mean is :

if the membrane has a leak you actually have intake manifold leak,
causing your engine to not idle properly...
