Subject: Rare Flavor of Vanagon

Local shop that knows of my addiction has dangled a Vanagon that I am able to
resist, but which is a combo of features you don't see much:  1980, 9-passenger,
air, automatic, gas heater.  Body has dings, but not bad rust.  Driver seat
is hopeless, middle seat missing, headliner good, airco fiberglas not cracked.
Odometer in the 80s.  I have the impression that an offer of $1k would not be
laughed off:  they are fighting the urge to part it out -- one vent window is
already gone, and I'm trying to tempt them into selling headrests etc. from it.
It's at Sportwagen in Hackensack NJ, 201-489-7828.  I am not involved in the
transaction in any way except that if you *don't* buy it, I may get some parts
off it.
