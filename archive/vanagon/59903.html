Subject: Erratic Power

I have a 1985 Vanagon GL with 125,000 miles  (30,000 on an engine
rebuild).  Lately, it has developed a tendancy to be sluggish on some days,
and ok on others.  Perhaps, I have a dreaded intermittant problem because
I can be chuggin' along and all of a sudden get a burst of power.  Gas
mileage however never seems to be vary  so I suspect a fuel metering
problem rather than an ignition problem

I'm getting ready for some summer troubleshooting and will go after these
items:
             Fuel filter
             Plug wires
             Oxy sensor
             temp and airflow sensors (ugh)

Does anyone have any experience with symptoms like these -- can you
suggest which items above might provide the most leverage ?  Also, I've
heard that Vanagons sometimes have grounding problems with the
electronics -- any tips there?
