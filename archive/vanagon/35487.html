Subject: 1600 Rebuild Notes/I Got Diesel on my Pressure Plate


Stuff you might be able to use:

I had never fooled with a flywheel nut prior to yesterday. Equipped with a
four-foot cheater and a four-foot chunk of channel bar to lock the thing
per Muir (sanded and painted with the help of my daughters, to make it
mine, per Hoover) I bent a Chinese breaker bar. Easily. After I tried twice
the poor thing had a fairly radical S-curve.

This necessitated a trip to Sears to buy a good 1/2&quot; drive breaker bar that
would not (paradoxically) break. These are very expensive. Hence I learnt:

If you are going to mess around with flywheel nuts, when you get your 36 mm
socket, get it with a 3/4&quot; drive. They don't cost any more than those with
the 1/2&quot; drive, but the cheap Chinese 3/4&quot; breakers have a good chance of
holding up where the 1/2&quot; won't.

(Brother Muir has his little cartoon people prying these things off with
the cheater forcing a 3/8&quot; ratchet. I now find this hilarious.)

A question I have:

I was cheerfully washing parts in a big vat of diesel fuel with a brush and
I splattered a perfectly good pressure plate. Many miles left on it. It
wasn't soaked, exactly, but I did have to wipe it off. Did I ruin it?
