&gt;Speaking of which, I used to have some cooking guidelines which would allow
&gt;for cooking in the engine compartment (then it was a big V8 engine).  I
&gt;remember like a couple hours for a whole chicken, or baked potatoes, or foil
&gt;dinners (corn, hamburger meat, carrots).  Does it get hot enough in the
&gt;engine compartment of a bus, on the top of the block, to do this?  Anybody
&gt;know, or tried it?

there is a book, Manifold Destiny, which is a cookbook about using the heat
from a car's engine/exhaust to cook meals. the book is available through
Classic Motorbooks (whose catalog i got just a couple of days ago). if anyone
is interested, i'll post the 800-number and catalog info. :)
