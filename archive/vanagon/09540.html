I don't  think we can leave this discussion without commenting on how nice
Martha's van looks.  She has put a huge amount of working into restoring the
drive train and the interior.  New upholstery and even fabric covering of
most of the interior panels, like the inside of the sliding door for example.

Of course there is a price to pay....  It's the first time I have seen a
vacuum cleaner going at a camp site!  Martha do you have a 12V rug shampooer
as well?
