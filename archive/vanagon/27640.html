Subject: Table trouble



The rear table on my 84 Westy keeps swinging out and smashing back into
the trim panel which is now cracked and getting worse.  It does this however
tightly I screw the clamp.  I have tried putting a rubber bumber strip
on the table and also taping the table mount to increase friction but neither
has helped.  I can't be the only one with this problem and someone must have
come up with a clever solution?
