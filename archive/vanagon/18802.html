&gt; Well, I must admit if I owned one of the genuinely 1 or 2
&gt; EuroVans VWoA managed to sell around the country I might
&gt; figure rarity made it sort of neat myself, but remember
&gt; rarity alone doesn't make a cool car, it had to be in
&gt; demand as well.

 I can't avoid seeing EuroVans any more.  Not as many as Vanagons but 
they had a dozen years of sales.  Around here I see MORE Eurovans than 
Microbuses for what its worth.

&gt; airCOOLED, the only real COOL VW's

Cool in the Winter and Hot in the Summer ;)
