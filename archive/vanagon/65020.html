&gt; Hi from Minnesota.  You can get an oil pan heater direct from your VW
&gt; dealer.  It bolts on to the bottom of the oil pan.  We got one for our 84
&gt; Vanagon and found that it worked great, even at -25.  The VW part # is
ZNP
&gt; 289104.  It cost $ 66.95 on 2-1-96.
&gt; We have since switched to an 86 Synchro which cannot use that heater
&gt; because of the different configuration involved with the synchro.  We
&gt; purchased an aftermarket magnetized model, which was smaller and fit in
the
&gt; available space.  Just to be sure, we glued it on also.  (Be sure that
the
&gt; oil pan is very clean prior to gluing it on.)  Good luck.

&gt; &gt; I know it is a bit early in the season to be thinking cold and snow but
&gt; &gt; here in Montana it is never too far off.  At any rate I'd like to be
&gt; ahead
&gt; &gt; of the stuff this year and would like to know if anyone out there knows
&gt; &gt; where I can find the engine heaters that attach to the bottom of a
&gt; vanagon
&gt; &gt; water cooled engine.  I know they existed for the older air cooled
&gt; engines
&gt; &gt; but I can't seem to locate a heater for my 87GL.
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
