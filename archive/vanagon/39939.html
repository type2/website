&gt;Hi all. Does anyone have access to a Snap on Tool dealer? There are a few
&gt;items I would like to purchase and my local guy doesn't seem to want to
&gt;deal with me. I called him, my friend called him no -dice. I need some
&gt;inpact sockets and that nifty spifty &quot;S&quot; wrench. TIA

see if you can get any help from these folks ...
