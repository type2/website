&gt; 
&gt;  Microbus  46 - Camper  15, Panel    6, Pickup   7, Kombi    8
&gt;  Bus      101 - Camper  56, Panel    0, Pickup   2, Kombi    3
&gt;  Vanagon  107 - Camper  51, Panel    2, Pickup   0, Diesel   8, Syncro  11
&gt;  Eurovan   12 - Camper   4, Panel    0, Pickup   0, Diesel   2
&gt;  Total    266
&gt; 
&gt;  Vanagon Mailing List   253 people,   266 vehicles
&gt;    46 Microbus,  101 Bus,  107 Vanagon,   12 Eurovan
&gt;    35 Unknown,     9 Wanabus
&gt; 


  Cripes, we lost a '74, I may have to buy another one to stay ahead of the 
  '75s. 

  Now lookee here - the bus contingent needs only 7 more members to overtake
  the Vanagon contingent. That would be an interesting twist considering the
  name of the list. If all those wannabus folks do the &quot;right&quot; thing......
