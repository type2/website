Subject: Re: Gas Heater

this may sound stupid, but for the sake of discussion here it goes

you know those little square ceramic heater things (approx 8&quot; * 8&quot;) that
people put in their basements.... well, how difficult would it be to change
them from 110 volts to 12 volts so they could be used in a car. I have one
in the basement and it PUMPS out the heat. You could probably melt your
floormats with such a device.

Is ther some sort of voltage inverter/modifier that you could put in your
lighter socket to let such devices work. I know that they have such devices
to allow you to use your portable radio in the car  (i.e runs a 110 volt
appliance on 12 volt). What does everybody else think? Surely there must be
some way to get heat in the bus without having to rely on that old rusted
tube that runs the heat up from your engine to the cab.

&gt;&gt;Well, winter has finally arrived here in DC.  Once again I sit here at my
&gt;&gt;keyboard postponing the drive in to work at 15 degrees because I know that
&gt;&gt;the bus will stay at 15 degrees for the whole trip.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does anyone know what gas heater would have been installed in a '78 bus?
&gt;
&gt;The heater in my 79 is a Bosch, I believe.  (The other possibility,
&gt;according my my mechanic, is a Stewart-Warner--they were aftermarket, I
&gt;guess.)  I'm not really sold on these pups--mine's given me fits.  However,
&gt;on the increasingly rare occasions when it works, it works extremely well.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Do you want to sell it?
&gt;
&gt;I'd be VERY VERY happy to sell it if I could find something else to use.
&gt;But I rather doubt that's going to happen.  I've finally decided to have
&gt;Ark Mirvis (he had an article in LiMBO's &quot;Transporter&quot; last time) rebuild
&gt;the damned thing.  If that fails I think I'll put in a woodstove &amp; hope to
&gt;never get smacked. :)
