Subject: Re: Lost my Vanagon Headlights

Rich,

I lost the headlights on my '87 a few years ago. It turned out to be the
switch itself. With the help of the Bentley manual I was able to jump the
correct wires and get my lights back. Drove after dark 2 nights in a row like
that.

When I got to my destination, I had time to take the switch apart and was
able to lubricate the contacts and internal mechanism and get the thing
working again...it has worked ever since. Can't remember exactly what was
wrong, but I think the slides or contacts just weren't able to move together
to make the circuit. Worth a try!

Good luck, Dan
