Thanks for Tom Forhan's offer to help. The Vanagon I have is a 87 Wolfburg
Edition.

The problem is I am still trying to pull out all the dents as the van had
been hitted pretty hard from behind. I am using a 4 ton hydraulic ram to jack
out those dents but it is a very slow process as I don't have any body work
experience before (and I don't want to drill too many holes on the panals).

If I sucess to straighten the body, I will need a replacement rear hatch door
and the fiberglass bumper with end caps. But until then, I have to work on
the body first. Incidently, all the mechanical parts survived the crash, the
van is as drivable as before. (The idel control unit was crushed but I
managed to fix it up.  A victory for me.)

Regards.
