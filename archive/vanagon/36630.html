Subject: 1.8 gas vs. 2.1 boxer

With all the recent wasserboxer bashing that has been going one, I am 
curious about the gasoline 1.8l conversion.  For those of you that have 
done this conversion, how does the van drive?  How would you say the 
torque curves compare on the 2.1 vs. the 1.8 inline?  It seems the 
horsepower ratings are about the same.

I will probably be opting for a factory rebuild wasserboxer, but I too 
am curious as to why VW did not offer a gas 1.8 inline or even the 16v 
version.  Do these engines not have the lower end torque that a flat 
four can offer?
