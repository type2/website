Subject: Re: buses in movies

If you want to see a lot of busses, check the movie &quot;Gone in Sixty Seconds&quot;.
 This thing has bad acting, lousy directing, no plot at all, but all kinds of
early seventies cars.  The main car is a stolen '73 Mustang Mach 1 but I lost
count of busses (splits and loafs) at about 20.  &quot;I liked it so much I bought
the movie.&quot;  (Hope I don't get in legal trouble with the Remington Razor
guy!) :-).
