&gt; &gt; I hate to say it, but you can tow a nice trailer with a Caravan/Voyager 
&gt; &gt; and still beat a Vanagon up the hill
&gt; 
&gt; That may be, but it's still more of a pain in that ass (IMHO) than my 
&gt; '91 vanagon GL.  What's the point of taken the trip?  To get there as
&gt; fast as you can or to enjoy the drive on the way?
&gt; 

Putting the Caravan/Voyager on Cruise control and just having the peace 
of mind that you will arrive at your destination.
