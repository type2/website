With still no real VW content...

Seems an odd situation but I VERY often get responses before the post 
they refer to.  KInd of depends on what route indicidual notes take 
through the net.  Doubt switching providers would FIX things.  I come 
through a direct i-net provider.

Well I used the word &quot;things&quot; - not a bus but it is also the name of a VW....

&gt; responses to it about 24 hours before the original posting!  Is this an AOL
