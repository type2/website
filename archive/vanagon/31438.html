&gt; Yeah, by all means the two-battery setup is the minimum acceptable for the

&gt; could remember to park headed downhill ?! Me, I drilled a hole in the bottom
&gt; of the box, siliconed in a drain thingy and go with the sack or (if you can
&gt; get it) block of ice. BTW, did you hear about the guy who threw a block of
&gt; dry ice in on top of his bacon, eggs and liverwurst? Rilly happened.

I took a cookie sheet and cut it to make a rack just the right size for a 
block of ice; gave me a few extra inches and some added stability in the 
cooler. Block ice is groovy if you're only going to need a cold box for 2 
or 3 days. 8) Joe
