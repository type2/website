Subject: Re: More horse power from the 2.1??

I (Syncrohead) said:
&gt;&gt;  Also, the pressures created by the piston compression are far higher than
any turbo
&gt;&gt;can create during the intake stroke.

Sstones replies:
&gt;But... Once the turbocharged intake strok is over... You get a 
&gt;compression stroke at a much higher pressure, there in lies the problem.

I reply:
Ah-hah!  That makes sense.  With more gas (&amp; pressure) in the cylinder at the
beginning of the compression stroke, there will be higher ultimate pressure
at the end of the stroke.  This must be why turbo engines generally run a
lower compression ratio - to allow for the additional compression effect of
the turbo.
