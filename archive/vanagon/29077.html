Yup, June through August....

But how often when its 0 degrees Farenheit/some 20 below Celsius in the 
middle of February?

How often does it get too cold on a sweltering August afternoon?

EV/T4 has better temperature control than previous Transporters.  I think 
I prefer the rear engine/rear drive for bad weather road driving.  I 
definitely prefer the older vans for off road use. (over my EV MV - not 
sure of the European name - Multi something)
