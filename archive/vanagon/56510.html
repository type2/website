Maybe Helmut has something to do with it ;-)

NO NO No No, That wasn't me! I preferred the fire department
instead of going to the army.

If it was a German spec vanagon, it should be a very late
'89 or '90 model. All Bundeswehr Vanagons I see on the
VAG garage's lot opposite of the street have round headlights.
Do you remember, did the Vanagon have side reflectors?
Was it a Diesel? Was it a young guy in the Vanagon?
