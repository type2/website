Subject: Re: Cheapo Oil Thermometer ???

Try a restaurant supply business.  Back in my pseudo-chef daze, it seems 
like we had a thermometer that went upwards of 300+ degrees and had a 
probe approx. 5 inches long (...resist the temptation to crack wise) ;-)

&gt; Hello friends!
&gt; 
&gt; With all the talk of overheating I went in search of a candy 
&gt; thermometer, but of the many places I tried I came up empty handed.
&gt; 
&gt; All of the candy thermometers are encased in glass casing which is 
&gt; about 1/2 inch wide (of those that I saw), and would be too wide to 
&gt; fit down the dipstick hole.  
&gt; 
&gt; I saw some meat thermometers which looked great (would fit sizewise), 
&gt; but alas they only go to 180 degrees or so.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?
