Subject: handling on pre '68


Now that my bus is on the road, I've noticed the handling isn't quite 
what I would like it to be.

For example, at 70mph (tailwind, 65 into the wind) it takes about 3 
lanes to go straight:-}  Not all of this is due to crosswind.

I think this is because of the apparent slack in the steering wheel.  I can
turn the wheel a couple inches in both directions without any perceptable
change in direction.  What I think happens is, as the car starts to leave 
the center of the lane, I turn to compensate, but not enough fast enough 
and then I have to crank it hard to get back in my lane.  I would think
tightening up the stearing would solve a bit of the problem.  
(I don't think I can do anything about the fact that the car is a big sail!)

I don't expect the bus to handle like my Honda, but I would like to be able to
keep up with traffic and only take 1 lane!

If anyone has some suggestions I'd sure like to hear them!

...Markus
