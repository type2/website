&gt; Brett, I'm copying your note to the vanagon list because, though I'm

Will do... there was a glaring mis-statement.  And I see no one else 
responded to the list... so I will. :)  CCs all around.

&gt; &gt; Finally, how much should I
&gt; &gt; expect to pay for 4 cylinders, pistons and rings 
&gt; 
&gt; If you have to buy cylinders, etc., it will depend on the size of your 
&gt; pistons (or the size you're installing). JC Whipme (actually Whitney) 
&gt; sells 85.5 mm sets for $84.95 and 90.5 sets for $149.95. If your engine's 
&gt; stock, I'll bet (but don't count on this) that you use the latter. You 
&gt; may use even bigger. I'm not sure.

Well, the '77 should have a type IV 2 liter FI engine in it, unless he's in
Europe or done a conversion.  They use 94mm cylinders for the 2l engine cost
about $300.  Ask Dave Schwarze, he just bought a set for his new rebuilt
engine.
