Hi Volks,
  Heres a joke I heard the other day and had to pass on.  

St Peter is doing his interviews with people who want into heaven.  Up
walks a guy and St Peter ask how he got there.   
The man replies, 'I was exucuted for killing my wife.  I found out she
was screwing around on me and I busted into our apartment to catch
them.  I found this guy hanging from my balconcy and I grab a hammer and
smashed his fingers and he fell 10 stories to the ground below.  Then to
make sure he was dead I threw the refrigerator on him.&quot;   
'Thats awfull&quot; replied St Pete  &quot;You can't come in here&quot;.
The next guy walks up and St Peter asks him how he got here.
&quot;Well its like this. I got a new trampoline and was trying it out on my
balcony and I jumped the wronge way and fell off.  Luckly I grab hold of
the balcony below my apartment. I was hanging off getting ready to climb
up when this mainiac smashes my fingers with a hammer and I fell to the
ground.  Just as my life was fading out I saw him throw a refrigerator
down on top of me too.&quot;  
'You poor man&quot; says St Peter  &quot;go right in&quot;
The next guy walks up and St Peter ask him his story.
The man replies &quot;Picture this St Pete, I'm naked and hiding in a
refrigerator.....&quot;   =)   Take care.
