Subject: Re: Air Filters

Hi all,

One thing often mistakenly recommended is cleaning paper air filters with
compressed air.  This loosens the dirt, and the first time the engine is
started after cleaning a huge cloud of grit enters the engine.  Want proof?
 Clean your shop-vac's filter then start it up and watch the cloud of dust
that appears.   (ok for a shop vac--not for an engine)
