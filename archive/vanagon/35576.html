Subject: Re: Which tires?185 or 205

&gt;&gt; I was thinking about making the switch to 205's, looking for smoother ride,
&gt;&gt;more traction in mud &amp; snow.  And frankly, the westy looks like it's standing
&gt;&gt;on birdlegs on them skinny tires.


&gt;I don't think wider tires will give more traction on snow. On the
&gt;contrary: wider tires offer more surface for the snow to lift the vehicle
&gt;up from solid ground. Same as aquaplaning.
&gt;
&gt;Ideally, I'd like a set of wide wheels for the summer, but keep the stock
&gt;wheels w/ 185ers for the winter.

I thought that the 185 or 205 refered to the PROFILE of the tire. I'm not
sure. I have 195's, I thought they were taller than 185's not wider. What
do all those numbers mean? r75/195/14??? Now I'm confused.
