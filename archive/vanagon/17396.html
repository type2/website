I have no clue.  On the way to get a pizza 1 hour ago my friend and I saw
a late 70s westfalia pinned between a brick wall and a tree, across a
sidewalk, on it's side.  This not two blocks from my house.  On a residential
street!  The tow truck driver was just standing there looking bewildered.  :(
