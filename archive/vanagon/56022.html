Subject: WANTED - COPY 93 EV MV Supplimental Manual



A couple of weeks back someone (Bill Killian?) mentioned that there was a 
Supplimental manual for the EV Multivan, and they even posted the number. 
Well to make a long story short, I gave the number to the parts mgr at the 
local dealer...his computer came up dry....I called VWUS, they never heard 
of it....and to throw salt in the wound, I dumped the original post....

So could someone out there make a photocopy of it and send it ot me? I'll 
pay for postage, copying, etc. This way, I have a copy, and I can send VW AG 
in Wolfsburg a picture of what I want.

Here's my address:

Ric Golen
8 Pearl Street 
South Dartmouth, MA 02748-3614



Thanks in advance....


Ric
