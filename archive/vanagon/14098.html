Subject: Re: My Tank Runnith Over

 Sure enough there was a waterfall or should I say gasfall

.............................................................

Same thing happened to me when I took delivery of my used '83 Vanagon
campmobile. the sales guy just about gave birth to kittens. (how cute!)

The cause of the problem was dried out/missing seals and hoses. When you
replace the main hoses don't forget to replace the breather/seals and hoses
as well as the seals around the overflow-expansion tanks. You will
experience a bath of gas on your foot as you fill up your tank and get to
the cut-off point. About a gallon of gas slooshes out onto the floor just as
the nozzle clicks off for the first time. These items were (eventually) all
replaced and the problems disappeared. Check your manuals for the exact
parts. I admit that I am winging it on this msg - I don't have the manuals
with me.
