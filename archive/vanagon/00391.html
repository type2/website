Subject: 34-PICT-3 Needed Cheap

Sorry is this is a repost. I am having trouble with mailers.

Hello,

I am attempting to get my '71 Bus back on the road. I still
need a 34-PICT-3 carb (or equivalent later model). It has
to have dual vaccum ports, one for vacuum advance, one for
vacuum retard. 

Condition needs to be decent, it should be rebuildable,
but does not need to have been rebuilt.

Got one laying around? Drop me a line. Give me a price.
