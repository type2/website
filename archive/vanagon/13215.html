Subject: 84 westie for sale


That's right, my 84 westie is in the block.  here are the vitals:
-1.9L, 4sp, absolutely reliable
-143,000km (89,000mi) highway driven, parked winters
-brown in color with nose bra and wonderful *trim line* stripes!
-everything works (incl fridge, aux heater, sink etc)
-includes voltage inverter, deep cycle aux battery and a custom-made *oven*
-good paint, clean, straight, well cared for vehicle (of course!)
-paid 10,500cdn two yrs ago. asking $9500 or nearest

it's been in kingston, ontario for the past 6 months but spent the 
previous ten years in western canada.  as far as i know, it has never 
been winter driven (i still can't get over how much salt is used on roads 
out here!).  previous two owners actually paid the local vw dealer to 
maintain it for them (don't know if that's good or not, but have receipts 
to prove). i replaced the clutch last summer (the $3.50 seal around the trans
input shaft leaked fluid back onto the clutch causing troubles) and the spark 
plug leads last month.  needs a muffler, but i figure the new owner might as 
well have the lifetime guarantee. reason for selling: just ended a 
relationship and the van got caught in the middle.  seem to recall someone 
from the northeast (??new england??) was saying good buses were hard to come 
by out here. perhaps you will want to check this out?!  i'd like to see it go 
to a good home.
