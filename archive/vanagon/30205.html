Subject: Owners Manuals

Looking for that owners manual that the PO forgot to put in the glove 
box...didn't have one...lost yours?

Just call VW-America at 1-800-544-8021, if its still available they will 
gladly sent it to you.  I just got off the phone with them and have a 82 
Vanagon owners manual on its way.  Cost me $10, but hey, its worth it.
