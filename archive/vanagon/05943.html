&gt;Nothing ruins the peace and quiet of camping more often than generators. 
&gt;Noise that would be acceptable IMO in a city is unacceptable out in the 
&gt;woods.

&gt;Pete, I noticed that almost everything (except the microwave) that you 
&gt;used with the generator would be adaptable to 12 volts (without an 
&gt;inverter) or propane. A much friendlier alternative.

I noticed that almost everything could be left at home and not missed. Isn't 
that the idea of camping?
