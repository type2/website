&gt;         Mine is not chromed but it is exactly as you described.  I got it 
&gt;         from some supply house in Oregon that does camper parts and VW 
&gt;         canvas or some such.  I can get the address of the place at the 
&gt;         next Transporters meeting (in about 3 weeks) if anyone needs it 
&gt;         and it doesn't appear before then.  We ordered a bunch of them in 
&gt;         bulk about a year ago and I don't remember many of the details.  
&gt;         In any event, it shortens the shift throw considerably.

Er, how can it shorten the throw if it lengthens the gearshift?  Are we
talking about the same thing here?  That piece that screws on where your
shift nob would go and raises the nob a couple of inches?
