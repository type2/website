Subject: Blown Coolant Hoses

&gt;my '87 Vanagon has blown 5, yes 5 different coolant hoses since &gt;last Labor
&gt;Day. I have spewed coolant (the good stuff) all over the state of &gt;Indiana.
&gt;Is it just me? Is it the fact that the van is now 8 years old and they &gt;all
&gt;need to be replaced. Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and &gt;replace
&gt;the rest (might have to get a 2nd mortgage on the house)? Are you &gt;guys
&gt;running in to this?

I  haven't had the problems you have had however I have noticed one thing
with my 87' Syncro.  There are a lot of hoses which i have found to be
chafing against brackets, and other things within the engine compartment.  At
these locations the hoses were found to be in bad condition.  I spent an
entire weekend checking all the hoses and replaced all  that appeared to be
in bad shape.   I've been lucky so far.
