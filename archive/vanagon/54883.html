Subject: Air-Cooled Email list?
Date: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 12:21:38 -0500

I recently unsubscribed from VintageVW, couldn't handle all the mail :-(

But a friend mentioned that he heard there was an air-cooled list that was
mainly 'for sale' items. Has anyone heard of this? Does anyone know how to
subscribe?
