Subject: Re: 87 syncro: replacing exhaust components

&gt;Is that where the skid rail can contact the exhaust if it's bent up?
&gt;I bent my skid frame again on a bad road and I think that the low
&gt;rumble that I hear now isn't a cracked exhaust, but the skid rail
&gt;contacting either the engine frame or an exhaust pipe; this has
&gt;happened before, has it happened to anyone else?  Except for the
&gt;muffler, I haven't had to replace any exhaust parts yet.

My skid frame hasn't bent enough to touch anything. I have had to replace
all the exhaust except the cat over the last 4 years. I bought the last
piece (the back header) from Parts Place, all the rest from the dealer. I
changed the pieces as they went bad.
With liquid wrench and some care the job wasn't too bad, the cost of the
pipes on the other hand....
