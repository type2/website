Subject: Help! I can't get it apart!

I know someone out there has already done this. I have an '87 camper
and I'm try to remove the plastic lower portion of the dash right
in front of the stick and below the radio. It's a vertical section
of plastic that I want to mount drink holders to and possibly
my CB. I have the radio out and I've looked from above, below
and the sides but I can't find where it's attached. If anyone has
(successfully) removed this piece please tell me how you did it.

I'm in digest mode so if you could write me directly and copy the list
I would appreciate it. Thanks in advance!!
