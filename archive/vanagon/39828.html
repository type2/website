Subject: Re: is TDI EV avail. in USA?


Nope....no EVs, other than the Winnebago, are currently available in the US. 
Out of all of the 6 or so engine variations the T4 comes in Europe, all VWUS 
(nee VWoA) chose to bring in was the 2.5 L 5 cyl gas engine. Rumor has it VW 
will be bringing the VR6 version to the states later this year.

I saw a TDI version of the EV Multivan in the dealer in Grenoble, France 
this January...looked nice.
