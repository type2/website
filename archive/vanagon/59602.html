Subject: Thanks again Gerry...

I too would like to commend Gerry S. on a job well done. He has
unselfishlessly run the Vanagon list for the last 3 years, and has done a
great job in overseeing it, keeping it from being overly moderated like the
&quot;other&quot; bus list... and generally letting the listmembers say pretty much
what they want.  That is one of the main reasons I enjoy this list. I have
also learned a great deal from this list in nearly a year since I have
subscribed to it.  I have also made many friends over this list bought and
sold Vanagon parts from other listmembers too. This list has become
invaluable to me and alot of other listmembers, and I am more than willing to
help pay for some equipment to keep it running. 3 dollars is nothing compared
to the information, and friends I have gained from this list.

Once again, THANKS GERRY!!!  
(Why, I think I even saw a bumper sticker on the back of a bus that said the
same thing a couple days ago....  
(uh, hmmm...I think that was a different Gerry  :&lt;)
