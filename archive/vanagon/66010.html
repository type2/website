Subject:      Towing suggestions/questions for Vanagon

Greetings all,

I  will soon need to transport a Vanagon about 270 miles.  I hope to use
a full size trailer for this, but if all else fails, has anyone tried
towing a Vanagon (2wd) with a car dolly?  Anything I should look out for,
other than removing the drive shafts, checking tires and suspension,
etc.,  before starting?

I am using a Ford truck (1 ton) to pull what ever I end up with, so that
part should not be problem (other than the gas bill :).

TIA,
Howard
