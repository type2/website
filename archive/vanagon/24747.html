Sean Writes:

My mechanic and I have checked out the engine fairly thoroughly. The oil
sensor is fine (new), the oil pressure is where it should be. So not a bad
oil pump. (just so you know) Compression is 125 in the back cylinders and 115
in the front. My current options for solutions are, use 20W/50. add Slick 50
oil treatment and/or add STP oil treatment.


I Say:
        Don't bother with Slick-50. Good way to waste $20. For more info
check out the gopher site, it has a lengthy artice about the virtues of
Slick-50 and the other oil additives. I'll give you a summary of said
virtues...none. Seems that the 'slick' folks in advertising don't get very
happy when asked for solid proof to thier claims, and start saying that the
information requested is &quot;proprietary&quot;. Do you smell a medium-sized furry
rodent? I do.

Peace,
