Subject: '68-'71 heater boxes

Opie, my '68 crew cab, has been updated with a dual port 1600 engine.  When 
I first got him, I removed the engine to check it over and found that the PO 
had wired the heater box flaps to full open position.  I assumed the heater 
cables needed replacing and removed his &quot;solution&quot;.  After lubricating the 
cables, they now work fine, but where they end (up high) and where the 
connection is on the heater box control lever (down low) is way far apart.

Question - is there a difference in the bus and bug heater boxes for these 
years?  
Does it just appear that I have the wrong heater boxes?  Bentley manuals for 
the 68-79 bus and 66-69 bug have the same picture for the heater boxes, but 
I know that the cable couldn't possibly reach where the heater box 
connection is - the cable has a welded on bracket to the frame.

TIA,

Dean Aukes

BTW - coat hanger wire holds them open just fine.......all the time.....
