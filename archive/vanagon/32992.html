Subject: Re: What do ya think? Eurovan Problem Tracking Database

Okay, routine service (15,000 mile checkup type stuff) as well?
How about warranty repair?

If not so far all you 'get' is my VIN - but I'll have to look that one up.
I'll type up a list of plastic bits that were repaired under warranty if 
you like.

Annoying everybody just to 'show' that some EVs are pretty much problem 
free...

&gt;   I was thinking that if you fellow EVers would be inerested in sending all 
&gt; the stats about your Eurovans, VIN, Costs, Repairs (mileage at occurance), 
&gt; everything but gas and oil.
&gt; 
&gt;   I would be willing to set up a database to track all the problems we
&gt; have and identify trends such as piston slap, coolant leaks, anything that
&gt; we could argue to VWoA as a design flaw or shoddy workmanship. 
&gt; 
&gt;   I have very little time to do this so I couldn't promise instant 
&gt; implementation and maintenance of the data.  But, I really think the data 
&gt; could save us all money in the long run.
