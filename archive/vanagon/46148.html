&gt;They have some Continental CR21 tires for $53.  The man said they are
&gt;reinforced.  Has anyone ever tried these?  All other reinforced tires I
&gt;have found start at about $70.

my personal experience, over the last 26 years with buses and Continental
tires is that Conti's suck. if your alignment gets even a tiny bit out,
the tires take a &quot;set&quot; and will NEVER recover, not matter how many times
you get the alignment reset. i'm NOT a big fan of Continental tires. :(

and yeah, $70-80 is about what the other reinforced tires cost. :(
