Subject:       Propane shut-off device

Paul asked:
&gt; There is a certain increased risk - I'm sure - in having an open propane
&gt; line while the bus is moving, in the event of an accident. I wonder if
&gt; there are fancier shutoff valves available that would sense a broken line
&gt; (perhaps by shutting off if the flow volume exceeds a certain level) and
&gt; mitigate this risk to some extent?

Camping World, that bastion of the one-piece jumpsuit, has such a 
device that limits LP gas flow to 10 SCFH in the event of a hose 
rupture, loose fitting, or regulator housing failure.  it be $24.75.
