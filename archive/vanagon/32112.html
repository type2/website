Subject: Re: Valve Cover Slips...

What's probably happened is that one end of the spring has popped out of
the small hole that retains it. Pull off the cover again and inspect where
the ends of the retaining spring contact the head.

&gt;It leaked again, and then I noticed that the left side of the spring that
&gt;holds the valve cover on was not really sitting in the valve cover...in
&gt;fact, I could push the left side of the cover around...not good...
&gt;
&gt;As it was late and dark and I wasn't sure how to remove the spring lever, I
&gt;took a cat food can and cut a piece of tin, shoving it between the valve
&gt;cover and the left side of the spring.  It holds it tight, but I was
&gt;wondering if anyone has ever had a similar problem and how I could go about
&gt;fixing it.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
