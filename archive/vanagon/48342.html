Subject: Re: fridge/sink on 74 Westy - Answers and more questions

Hi, Adam!  I have a '75 Westy, and, while I don't know the answers to all
of your questions, perhaps I can help out a bit...

&lt;snipped for our pay-per-minute friends&gt;

&gt; First of all how does the sink work?  There is the plastic water
reservoir 
&gt; underneath the sink but is there an electric pump to pump the water up 
&gt; through the faucet or do I just whip that handle next to the faucet back 
&gt; and forth to get the pump to work.  

The electric pump draws from the tank under the sink in my '75.  The handle
is only operational when you've hooked up to external water.  The hookup
for that is located on the outside, right outside of where the sink is, on
the driver side of the vehicle.

&gt; Secondly the fridge has  been disconnected (says the previous owner) and
&gt; I'm not too sure what to do about getting it working again.  Do I need
some
&gt; sort of special tool to light the pilot light?  

The fridge on my '75 remains an unmentionable mystery to me.

&gt; And finally for the 110 V setting doesn't this mean that it runs when the

&gt; Westy is plugged in? I've hunted around for a plug but I can't seem to
find 
&gt; one anywhere that plugs into a normal socket; was this an option or what
is going on.  

Again, right by the hookup for external water, there's a (male) outlet
where you plug into external power.  My bus came with an
ultra-heavy-duy-looking cord with the correct femal end and a regular male
plug at the other end.  Once this is hooked up, the sockets in my Westy (on
the front panel of the back pax seats) are live.  

&gt; Thanks in advance and I'm pretty sure that I'll be asking many more
questions so
&gt; please bear with me.

My pleasure!  Now, for the questions I did not answer - anyone out there
know the following?

1) Is the fridge propane-powered or somesuch???  I had thought that the
propane tank on mine was just for the stove, and that my fridge was a lost
cause that required external AC anyhow.  If this is not the case, I am VERY
happy... make my day?

2) In the engine compartment, there's plenty of space on the driver side
(opposite the engine battery) for an RV-style battery.  Has anyone done
this and installed an AC converter?  Is this a pipe dream or a darned good
idea?  Or is the external AC hookup the only possibility?  My '75 has what
appears to be some sort of a charge meter by the switch that powers up the
internal 110 sockets when external AC is hooked up.  Does this mean that
I'm ready to go - just need to find an RV battery?

My turn to thank anyone who has the answers, in advance.
