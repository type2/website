Blair,

As mentioned the wrench extension works.  However, it can exert a lot of 
sideways force on the lug, perhaps not a good thing.

What has always worked for me is positioning the cross wrench on the nut so 
it is nearly horizontal.  Putting a jack or carefully chosen object (size 
and strength) under one end of the cross wrench, and then standing on the 
other.  Think this through so you that are loosening.

The above method only allows torque on the lug.  However it is good only 
through a relatively small arc since the alignment changes as the lug 
turns.  This is not a problem though if you only use the method for 
breaking the lug loose and exercise reasonable care.

Mike
