Subject: 83 aircooled front suspension

Greetings-
just did an inspection on the under carriage of my new 83 aircooled and f=
ound that I am missing one of the link rods that connect the sway bar to =
the lower control arm and the other is broken!

If anybody is parting out a vanagon and can spare these rods i would be h=
appy to purchase them.

Anybody had this happen before?

Thanks
