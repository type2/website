&gt; On the rear brakes of my '85 vanagon there is a spring loaded clip on 
&gt; each side shoe.  Once you remove these three or four times (don't ask) 
&gt; they aren't so hard to get back replace.  Basically, I took a pair of 
&gt; pliers half opened and pinched the little metal &quot;shield&quot; and spring in 
&gt; one hand.  Then reached around and held the little pin in place with the 
&gt; other hand and ....PUUUUUUUUSHED...  

Oh those!  My favorite method for those is to use a socket of an appropriate
size to apply pressure to the spring, then reach around behind and turn the
pin 90 degrees from the rear with my thumb.  Anyone else have a good method
for getting these on and off?  Has anyone bought the $5 tool made for the
purpose?  :) :)
