&gt;&gt; The engine had a knock/rap when started cold which would go away in
&gt;&gt;about 3-5 seconds. Now the knock/rap is there all the time, its quite
&gt;&gt;loud. My guess is that the engine is nearing the end of its useful life.

Greg: Please be sure that the sounds you are hearing are not just a bad lifter.
That will make a nasty noise when the little buggers don't pump up properly. The
noise will be sort of a meduim-high pithced tapping sound...

Just my $.02. Hate to see a good engine torn down for a measly lifter...
