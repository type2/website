&gt;VW dealer for '81 and Cleveland.  What is wrong with these
&gt;speedometer/odometers?  I bought my '84 with 35 miles on it

the problem seems to be that the VDO mechanisms do NOT tolerate resetting
while the car is in motion ... that is, if you start rolling away from the
pump, and reset the trip odometer, the little gear will get broken after
you do this multiple times. :(  it's a fairly common problem on volvos as
well. so if it ain't broke yet, be sure to reset it ONLY if you are sitting
dead still.
