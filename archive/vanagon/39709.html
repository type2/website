Subject: Re: Martha's Stroy about Gas Smells

Well since I also have a gas smell with a full tank and bumpy roads or hard 
left turns, this part of the story interested me:

&gt;The gasoline smell - and the eventual *KABOOM* conflagration -
&gt;come from gasoline sloshing out of the tank right back there
&gt;under the linen closet by the hot engine.

and to check:

&gt;Remove the round metal cover
&gt;on the side wall of the engine compartment near the regulator.
&gt;With a full tank, jump up and down on the bumper, slosh that gas
&gt;around in the tank, and reach right in the round opening and grab 
&gt;the hose.If you get gas all over your hand, why ... I guess you've 
&gt;got a bad diaphragm too, huh?

Now I'm not sure what the linen closet is but the gas on my 77 is coming from 
the compartment on the other side of the round metal cover.  The rubber boot at 
the top of the fill neck had a crack in it and I replaced it which helped a bit 
but there is still gas leaking down in there somewhere.

Now my question is:

How can they say that this is &quot;right back there by the hot engine&quot;?  I can't 
see any way that the gas that is occasionally dripping down on the other side 
of the round metal cover can ever splash onto my hot engine.

Did I misunderstand the description of where the gas in the story was dripping? 
 Should I be worried?  I've just been keeping my tank around half full and 
didn't think I would be risking a bonfire if some did happen to leak.  Am I?
