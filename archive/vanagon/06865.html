Subject: The Car Talk Brothers strike again
Date: Sun, 20 Nov 1994 18:44:43 -0600 (CST)

Tom and Ray Magliozzi, the car talk guys from public radio, also have a
column every Saturday in the local paper (in yours maybe too). Topic of
the day: The All-Time Worst Cars. 

They have 4 categories: aesthetics, performance, comfort, and reliability.
In their opinion, AMC made the ugliest cars (Pacer, Hornet, Gremlin,
Concord, etc.), Fiat the most unreliable. And for the other two categories...?
I quote:

&quot;Tom: My vote for the worst-performing car of all time would have to go to
the VW Diesel Rabbit. Talk about a dog! There were generally two
presidential elections held in the time it took this car to go from zero
to 60. [My comment: at least 4 years without refueling? Talk about economy!]

Ray: VW also takes home a trophy in the discomfort category. In
particular, the nod goes to the old, air-cooled Volkswagen Microbus. Not
only have I ridden camels that made my butt less sore, but you could never
get enough heat in the winter.
And because the passenger compartment was so big, your body heat would
never make a difference. In the Microbus, you'd need a family of panting
St. Bernards to keep the temperature above freezing.&quot;

Geez, what a bunch of whiners!
