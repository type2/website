&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm one of those silly people, and I maintain that it is better for my
&gt;&gt;&gt; engine to have the flaps removed.

&gt;&gt;What you don't see and is really silly is that without the flaps your engine
&gt;&gt;is taking longer to warm up to operating temp. which is more wear and
&gt;&gt;tear on your engine.  Granted, you are in a mild temp. zone but still,
&gt;&gt;it adds up.  Anything greater or lesser than the optimum operating temp
&gt;&gt;is not good for the engine.

I agree with Steve. And I have proofs.

I bought a 77 Volvo 264 with 70k miles a few years back. The seller said that
the Volvo has such a great cooling system that the temp guage never goes up
untill quite some time of driving on freeway.

I bought it and eventually realized that the cooling system thermostat was
shot. It stucked open for coolant circulation between radiator and engine
constantly. I had no idea how long it had been driven like that by the seller.

The engine power was weak. I did a compression check and yes, pretty much all
cylinders had low compression. I decided to do a valve job. I pulled the
heads (it's a v6 engine). I found that all pistons and cylinders were visibly
worn. I could rock pistons horizontally against cylinder walls!!!

I am hoping my 83 Westy engine has not been ruined by similar situation.
I bought it from a buddy of mine. He had the cooling system syndrome and
complained to his VW dealer about its flashing/overheating LED/temp guage.
The dealer flushed the cooling system, and of course it did not fix the problem.
My friend complaied again a few weeks later and they drilled 2 little holes
on its thermostat. Of course it did not fix the problem still but it delayed
the symptom to appear. By the time he arrived at his work location the LED/
temp guage was still at low position. He drove on since then.

He finally got tired of the Westy. I bought it from him and yes, was prepared to
cope with all the problems he had and left. The cooling system/overheating
syndrome is still there. The thermostat has been replaced so it warms up fast.
But the engine power is &quot;WEAK&quot;. I suspect that it has been ruined.

I am going to tear down the engine to fix the vanagon syndrome soon. I might
have to replace both heads and all cylinders/pistons/rings. At 60k miles, this
is the penality of running with slow warm up.
