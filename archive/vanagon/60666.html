Subject: Bye folks

Hello folks,
	I'm moving &amp; closing this e-mail account so it's good bye time. I'll be
back, I can't help it, I have never been long with out a VW bus and this
list is one of the best places to help keep it running. Besides this list
is fun to read! Thanks all.
	Stay out of mud,

	Rob
