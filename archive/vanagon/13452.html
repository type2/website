Ok Folks,

  My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NuBus ('82 Diesel).
These were some of his quotes:

 &quot;I Hate that freaking car&quot;

 &quot;It's so ugly&quot;

 &quot;It's so loud&quot;  &quot;It's so stupid&quot;  &quot;I'd rather walk&quot;

He is embarrassed when he is seen in the bus; not
because of its condition, but because it is a VW.

He threatened to ignore us if we picked him from the 
school dance tonight in the bus...

So, am I alone with this? Any net.experience on remoulding
recalcitrant posterity?
