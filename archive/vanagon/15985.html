I believe you should make VW pay for the entire repair. Just print out about
25 tales of wow over these head gaskets, go through the FTC arbitration
program, and you should be able to get this whole job done for free an a VW
dealer.

Seriously.

And if you are under 50,000 miles VW will pay for the whole thing no
questions asked. For other mileage up to around 100,000, VW will pay a part
of the repair no questions asked. But by going through the FTC program you
should be able to get this thing done for free.
