&gt; Well Joel I am a wannabus, a camper.  I subscribed to this list to learn 
&gt; more about VWs and which year to buy.  I still dont know yet.  I woul 
&gt; dlike to spend about $ 5K give or take.  I want to explore more of 
&gt; California, so hillperformance is a must.  ALso I dont have much time or 
&gt; money to fix things so reliability is a must.
&gt; 
&gt; Any pointers ?
&gt; 

Hill performance and VW Type II's don't usually happen in most cases.  Unless
you have $5K to throw down on a Porsche 6 banger and replace your VW engine
with it.  But that shouldn't keep you from enjoying the VW.  Hill climbing
isn't the only game when camping.  What about a practical place to sleep 
whether you're on a trip or not?  Handy cabinet to keep your travel stuff
ready to go at any time.  Good gas mileage considering it's size.  Sleeping
for 4.  Ready water supply, fridge and stove to boot.  C'mon get over that
need to race to the top of the hill and enjoy the scenery.  Besides when
your in a VW Camper/Bus, everyone knows your 'Way Cool'.

Cheers,

Steven
