Subject: RE: 911 motor in a VW transporter

914/6 engine is essentially identical to a 1970 911T 2.0liter.  But since
all the 911 engines have essentially the same form factor from 1965 through
1981, a 3.0liter 210hp 914 is no trick at all.  Closer to home, this means
that if someone leaves a good 3.0 liter engine in my driveway some far-off
day, I can swap the 2.7 and the bigger one in about 3 hours.
