Subject: Re:Thing towing


To All:

Bill's impression that towing the Thing did not have a significant impact on
the tow-vehicles fuel economy is probably correct.  Since tow was supporting
all of its own weight (that is, zero tongue-weight), and the shape of the tow
vehicle was allowing the tow to roll in relatively windless conditions, once
the added load had been accelerated to speed, so long as the road was
reasonably flat the amount of extra energy needed from the tow vehicle is
very small.

Owners of large RV's often remark that they don't even know their towed
vehicles are back there, when the towed vehicle is a small, light-weight car.

If you have the gearing to get your load up the grades, you can usually work
your way up to highway speeds on the flat with some surprisingly heavy loads.
 I used to haul hay from Patterson, CA to Los Angeles when I was a kid.  None
of the trucks I drove were more than a hundred horsepower and a typical load
was about 40,000 pounds.
