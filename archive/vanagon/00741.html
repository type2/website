&gt; Actually, the 2nd antenna I bought at the VW dealer. Then I sent it in to
&gt; STICO and told them to make sure it could handle 100 watts output at my car
&gt; alarm frequency of 27.195. They did the mod, so now if someone breaks into my
&gt; car in manhattan, my beeper goes off in my apartment and I can run down to
&gt; the street in my night gown and a stick. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then, when I run up to the van and 15 ugly guys are ripping it off I...I...
&gt; 
&gt; ..what do I do then?

Handguns are still legal in New York. Go to the local NRA, enroll in the
firearms safety course, do some time on the firing range, buy a nice 
comfortable weapon, store it safely. Then, when your pager goes off, 
shoot it and it will be quiet.

Seriously, though, the idea is to make your vehicle a hardened target.
Make your vehicle less attractive to potential thieves. Anything that
makes it more likely for them to try someone else's car instead of yours.

Prevention is impossible. Redirection is easy.

Clubs are the first level of hardening. They are miniscule in their ability
to keep your car from being stolen, but they are just a tiny bit harder than
the guy next to you.

The next level is a decent alarm... maybe $300... and it will annoy you
more than anything. Cheap alarms are cheap. They will give false alarms.
They will get you uninvited to the neighborhood block party.

The ultimate level is a security system that does not give false alarms,
does not give away any information on how good it is, and gets your 
attention. Face it, no one else cares about your car like you do. You 
want the beast to get YOUR attention. These types of alarms disable the
engine, relock the doors, and possibly scream in the ears of potential 
theives.

Some people joke about more &quot;active&quot; systems. Ones that damage the person
stealing your car. The legal problems here are not worth the trouble.
However, putting razor blades on the fins of your amplifier will make you 
feel real warm and fuzzy when you find bloodstains in your trunk.

&lt;* goes back to sleep *&gt;

PS, I _will_ post a list of alterators and other electrical toys at some 
point.
