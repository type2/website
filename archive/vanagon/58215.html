Found in the Grass Valley Union newspaper last night -

'79 VW van needs engine, good body/tires. $150  916-477-7047

'80 Vanagon $500  also VW cases  916-265-5798
also has a '66 Dodge Dart for the true afficianado! $700

Both were found in the Auto Parts Section, not in the Vehicles for 
Sale section so YMMV.

(2) '80 Westis
