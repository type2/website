Subject: VW Screen supplier

RE:  SCREENS
&gt;I'm sure screens can be made from stock components. The frames are simply
&gt;hollow aluminum strips connected with L-fittings. I've never seen a supplier
&gt;of screens, but if there's a market out there, I'd be happy to start up a
&gt;weekend manufacturing business. I may not be a mechanic, but Joe Knows
&gt;Screens. ;) Joe
