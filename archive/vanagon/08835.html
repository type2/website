So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; With all this talk about seatbelts/airbags/idiots, did anyone
&gt; catch the study done in Virginia recently on the news...
&gt; aparently the accident rate for people driving cars with airbags
&gt; is 70% higher, or at least for drivers at fault, than drivers
&gt; without airbags.

Yeah, I caught that this morning.  It was a good chuckle.  Serves
an MF right if they think an airbag is going to keep them out of
an accident or a law suit for that matter.  There obviously others
out there that don't have any delusions about having airbags and
getting into accidents.

&gt; Now my personal bitches regarding other drivers:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Friggen Blue hairs who go like a bat out of hell from a side
&gt; street onto a main street and then immediately drop from 40 mph
&gt; to 5 mph....

I get this all the time.  This happens with freeway lane changes 
too.  Guy behind me has to pass me then slows down.  I'm using a
cruise control for cryin' out loud!

&gt; 2. Godddamned immigrant types (Screw politically correct!) who
&gt; let their toddlers stand up on the front seat or have grandma,
&gt; grandpa, three aunts and uncles, mom and dad and 5 kids in a 
&gt; 5 passenger car ALL without seatbelts...

Racial and ethnic background has nuthin' to do with the people
that do this one.  I've plenty of people from all backgrounds
do this one.  Rich/poor, black and white etc.  I've seen plenty
of people do it.  Still, I think most drivers are responsible 
enough to have all riders use seat belts.  At least any California
anyway where it's required by the law.

&gt; 3. Certain groups of people who think lowered clapped-out
&gt; Toyota Corolla 1800s with huge stereos are cool...it proves
&gt; the old axiom...bitchin stereo....piece of shit car!

I'll stay outta this one since I got slammed real good in the
vintage VW group for bad-mouthing the Cal-look! :p

&gt; 4. Idiots who drive on your back bumper with the high beams
&gt; on...one cure for this...Osram makes a neat hand held,
&gt; self-contained emergency spot light about the size of
&gt; a tennis ball...plugs into a lighter...

This is always a problem.  Due to the increasing violent nature
of other drivers, I tend to speed up a little and pull to the
right ASAP.  Another old-fart wanna-be syndrom. ;)

&gt; can you say...full phazers MR. Chekov!! Just take that sucker
&gt; in one hand, reach behind your head, and point it out the
&gt; back window...and flick the switch!!

Yeah, but that just may be the driver with photon torpedo's :(

&gt; 5. Real old farts (as opposed to some of us old farts on the
&gt; net) who drive in the left hand lane of the interstate at
&gt; 55...the cure for those types is to pass them and then
&gt; immediately cut in front...let them gasp for a bit of air!!

I'll never understand these types.  I think that they think
they are somehow solving the speeding problem.  In reality
they are compounding it.  The Highway Patrol has enough to
deal with thank you.

&gt; Well thanks for the opportunity to vent!! Its been a shitty coupladays..

Have a mocha or latte dude.  You can't take care of everything.

&gt; wife's in the hospital...and the kids' cat ran away...I guess I shouldn't
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  This is a bad thing?  Sorry, I know your kids are hurtin' and I wouldn't
  say that to them.  I hope the kitty returns soon....
