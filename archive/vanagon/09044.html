Subject: Sorta Sticking Speedo

Anyone else experienced a speedometer that ocassionally just doesn't do 
its speed thing. The odometer never seems to stop, but for about the past 
year and a half, it will sudenly decide it isn't going to register 
anything. So far it has come back just as suddenly and will keep going 
just long enough to make me forget all about it.
The shop that I give an absurd amount of money to says that it means the 
speedometer is going out and I have to replace the whole thing some $$$ 
later.
Used to be you could uncouple the drive cable and shoot some dry lube in 
it, or replace a gear or two, but not any longer I am told.
Any ideas?? - Jack
