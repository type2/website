Subject: Stainless Steel Exhaust

A fellow posted here saying he was thinking of producing  a stainless steel
exhaust system for the waterboxer. I think this is an excellent idea, but I
cant find his address to tell him so. Could another listee please post it?
Also, how do I access the archives? Thanks for all the good info..Ken
