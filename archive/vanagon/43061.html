Subject: excess books

Whew!  Soooo many people...so few books.

all of the &quot;Small Wonder&quot; and all of the &quot;think small&quot; copies have gone off
to their new homes this morning via our favorite snailmail method.  If I EVER
run across more of either I will certainly post to the V-list first.


enjoy
