Subject: Correct thermostat for 78 type-IV bus ???
Date: Mon, 03 Mar 1997 11:40:28 -0500
From: &quot;Rodney L. Boleyn&quot; &lt;boleyn_at_scr.siemens_dot_com&gt;


The thermostat on my 78 bus (2000cc type IV, AFC, M/T) has a big hole
corroded in the side of it, and the thermostat cable hangs loose, with
the flaps held open by the spring.  I put it on my list of things to
get around to, and recently I ordered a new thermostat from the VWoA
dealer.

Before removing the old one and installing the new, I thought I would
perform the &quot;pan of hot water&quot; test described in Bentley and Haynes.
Both books state that the minimum length of the thermostat should be
46mm (1-13/16&quot;) at a temperature between 65-70'C.

I did the test using a candy thermometer, but the brand-new thermostat
as supplied by VWoA did not expand one whit at 65-70'C.  I
noticed, however, that the thermostat itself is stamped 85-90'C.
So I turned the heat back on under my pan of water and let it get
hotter.  Sure enough, around 80'C, the thermostat started to expand
noticably, and by 85'C, it had reached the requisite 1-13/16&quot;.

Now my questions:

1) The thermostat is a Wahler 1106.85.  Is this the correct thermostat
   for my bus, or did VWoA supply me the wrong part?

2) Is the thermostat I received defective, since it doesn't pass
   Bentley's 65-70'C test?  Or...

3) Is Bentley wrong on this point?  It makes sense that an 85-90'C
   thermostat would &quot;open&quot; around 85'C.

4) Would you install this thermostat on your bus?

Thanks a million,
Rodney
