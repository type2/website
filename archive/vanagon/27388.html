Subject: Help my sucking carb!

All,

Inorder to get my Thing in running condition (so I do not have to drive
the Chevy, or worse the Dodge Caravan(yech)) I need to fix something
seemingly minor on the carb of the Thing.  The stud to the rear of the
carb (FIF) is loose. It does not take much effort to move it.  My
question is this:

Can I use something like JBWeld, or Loctite to create a fix, or will I
be required to get a new stud, and have it pressed into the hole?
Eventhough it is not expensive, my wife is pressing me to get the Westy
running so we can camp, and sell the Caravan :-D.

Waiting with sucking carb,

David
74 Thing (insert sucking sound)
79 Westy (insert no clutch sound)
