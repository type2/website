&gt;I would like to go on march 24-26 but feel that I may be out of place with my
&gt;70 westphalia that is terrible on the outside &amp; ok on the inside.
&gt; Are all the people there in immaculate restored Kombis? or are there a few
&gt;buses that need external work like mine?

Oh yeah.  I am not going wherever on 3/24-26, but I do have a couple of 
busses that don't look so hot on the outside, or inside necessarily.  I have 
a 58 Dlx (non-sunroof) that is so eaten up by rust you can see through parts 
of the frame.  I want to drive it and not care about what it looks like, but 
I am afraid of driving down the road and having my frame snap in half ro 
something crazy.
