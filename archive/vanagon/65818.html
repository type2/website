&gt; hey y'all,  on the synchro, does the middle differential have the locking
unit on it
&gt; or the rear differential?
&gt; i was just wondering since i saw my friends defender 90 video and the
&gt; defender has a  locking center diff. so i was wonder ing where the diff
&gt; was on ythe van...

The center &quot;differential&quot; on a Syncro operates sort of like an automatically
locking
 differential and will lock up automatically when the rear tires begin to
spin.
The REAR differential in a Syncro may have a manually operated differential
lock.  This was optional 86-89 and standard equipment 90-91 in the USA.  Some
Syncros in other parts of the world also had a locking FRONT differential,
but none sold in USA.

Sudhir Desai, Do you own a Syncro?

Jim Davis
