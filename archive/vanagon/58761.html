Subject: Re: heating water for westy camping trips

I have two in the luggage rack.  I never have to move them.  I use a 
hose to fill them and just pull the hose over the side and take a shower 
 right next to either front door.  It won't reach the sink though so you 
just sling a towel over the mirror and wash your hands outside....
