&gt; Are you trying to tell me I have disk brakes in the back?
&gt; Gee, that would be nice &lt;grin&gt;.   You sure you don't have that backward?  
&gt; Now that I think about it, the disk brakes on my old toyota tercel had 
&gt; studs on the disk brakes.  Leave it to VW to be different, eh? All the 
&gt; drums I worked on as a kid had studs and nuts -- not bolts.  Except the 
&gt; VW bugs, that is.
