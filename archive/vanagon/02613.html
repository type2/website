&gt; my choice was to take the carbs off and have a two-barrel Holley single
&gt; carburetor and manifold installed. it took a while (like several months)
&gt; to get the jets and everything right, but when it settled down, i was

I did this on our 72 bus back in 1982 also.  We got the Weber version.
The hardest part was trying to get the jetting right.

&gt; getting about 19 mpg (it was a long time ago). as i recall, the things that
&gt; i did NOT like were:
&gt; * never did get the jetting right on the 2nd barrel, so when you really
&gt;   floored it (and the 2nd barrel open up), it took off like a damned drag
&gt;   racer. well ... i sorta didn't like that. :)

That's the best part of the kit.  I surprised people that way by taking off
like a dragster.  :-)

&gt; * the throttle linkage was on the 'wrong' side of the carb for where the
&gt;   carb sat on the manifold, and a bit of Bubba-engineering was required.
&gt;   but i was never quite happy with the way it looked. seemed to work ok,
&gt;   but it really looked kinda crappy (the linkage, that is).

We had to do the same thing.  We ended using a brass sleeve bolted through
the sheet metal.  The cable was also extended by soldering a small tube onto
it.  Looked good.

&gt;* had to fabricate a new air filter. basically Nothing off the old carbs
&gt;  would work.

I used some filters at a local speed shop that bolted right in place.
They were about 8 inches in diameter and 4 inches high.  Looked cool
to my V8 friends.

&gt;strangely enough, unless the 2nd barrel kicked in, it drove pretty much
&gt;like it had before.

Yup.  The mileage was pretty good with it.  The 2nd barrel was fun.
