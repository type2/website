&gt; with the purchase of the stuff from the '67 westy last week was 
&gt; a second gas tank... no big deal, except it has a small petcock with a 
&gt; lever on it, 'bout 3&quot;-4&quot; of stiff wire to the lever. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	The Local Bus Gurus have never seen one before... one thinks 
&gt; that it may be from an early Barndoor..

The reserve valves were used up to the early 60's (61/62?)

A barndoor reserve valve is about twice the size of the later one,
and has a bail with a knurled nut on the bottom, so it can be
taken apart and cleaned.  There are also versions with a clear
glass bowl, so you could see when it needed to be cleaned.

A barndoor gas tank looks totally and completely  different from
a &quot;normal&quot; tank, the first clue being the 85mm gas cap...
