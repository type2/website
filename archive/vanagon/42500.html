Subject: Re: oil temp gauge

Sean,
  i've never seen a clock in a breadloaf bus, but i assume you're referring
to the right instrument cluster hole in the dashboard ? left one is idiot
lites, middle one speed, right one is empty. i've mounted my oil temp gauge
in there. it's a VDO, german company with a very good reputation. got it
from Rocky Mountain Motorworks. to mount the gauge in that hole you take out
the instrument panel and then take out the black metal plate that sits in
the instrument housing if nothing else is. measure your gauge and drill a
hole into that plate with the same diameter as the gauge, and you're in
business. be careful not to break the glass plate in front of it, it
falls right out... only problem was, after i wired it correctly it turned out
that it was a bit bright when driving at night, so i wired its power through
the variable resistor for the instrument panel lights in the main
lightswitch. now i'm happy...
  good luck,
            G.

            &gt; Hey, &gt; Just
wondering if someone like VDO makes an oil temp. gauge that would fit in
&gt; the space for the clock?  That would be a useful way to fill that space.
&gt;
&gt; Probably not tho.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Sean
