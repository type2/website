Brian,

&gt; Since I was fairly partial to keeping 
&gt; some of my hard earned money I located the manufacturer of the pieces 
&gt; in North Beverly Hills.  (The library can give you the number 
&gt; usually).  Anyways I ordered the scissors for ~$30, the hinge for 
&gt; $10, and the covers were between $15 and $22 depending on which one.  

So who are these guys? What's thier phone number? You don't mean 
Euro-American RV Products (formerly Delta Six) do you? They are located
in No. Hollywood and charged me $40 including shipping for the skylight
seal. I was going to order the plexiglass but at ~$130 =:O , I decided
to shop around for a used one.
