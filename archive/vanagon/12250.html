You might try Parts Place (Formerly Recycled Bugs) in Auburn Hills, Mi.
Phone is 810-373-2300, fax 810-373-5950.

They have more than just Bugs; often they strip or part out whole Volks of 
all kinds and models.  I have found things for my 72 Westy and 93 E-Van.  
Also, check all the local wrecking yards; one here keeps several of these 
models around.

Good Luck,
Skip Correll
