Subject: RE: uninsured cars

Personally, as a student I find insurance to be a hassel, and a very 
large expense.  I can only drive one car at a time, I used to have two: a 
71 westy and a 72 convert.  Things changed, however, when my 71 was 
totalled by an uninsured driver, I'm now out of a car and it looks like I 
might not be able to get any compensation for it.  My only hope is ythat 
my company will pay for something.
