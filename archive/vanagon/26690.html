Hi Vanatics,
In the last couple of days I noticed 2 messages of mine that I had sent about
2 weeks ago.  They both look curiously out of context now since the topics
have long since been finished.  The messages are &quot;Zemco cruise control&quot; and
one about getting double messages.  Did AOL or the list server just send
these out? In which case everyone would have just received them. Or did the
AOL just give them to me? In which case everyone else would have received
them long ago.
