Subject: How did older vans carry wheelchairs?
Date: Thu, 23 May 1996 21:59:44 GMT

I'm considering getting a late splittie or early bay as a
&quot;fun&quot; vehicle and a driving restoration project.  One of my
considerations is being able to carry my 14-yr old son in
his wheelchair with us when we ride in it, yet also keeping
it authentic to the period.  My Eurovan has a modern
hydraulic swing-out wheelchair lift and a single point
floorlock, but I doubt such were used in the late 60's.

I am wondering if anyone knows what hardware was used in the
65-71 time frame to both get a wheelchair into the van and
to tiedown the chair in the van. Was it ramps?  Did they
have electric/hydraulic lifts for the VW's  back then?   Any
old photos or literature anyone has would be a great source
of info, as would any tips from anyone who has such an
adaptation in their bus.
