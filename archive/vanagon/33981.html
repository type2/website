&gt;Body found in van registered to Kevorkian

PONTIAC, Michigan (CNN) -- The body of a woman was left in a 
Volkswagen van registered to Dr. Jack Kevorkian outside the 
Oakland County medical examiner's office Monday, an 
investigator with the office said.

An investigator with the office said he found the 
unidentified woman's body, dressed in a robe, in the vehicle 
in a parking lot at 5:40 a.m. EST. The body had been there five 
to 10 minutes at most.  The site has been used by Kevorkian 
in the past.

&quot;I found it.  Then, we received a phone call from an unknown 
male saying, 'You'd better check the parking lot.'  But, we 
already had,&quot; said the investigator, who refused to give his 
name.

&quot;We know very little,&quot; said Sgt. M. James Sutton of the 
county sheriff's office.  &quot;It has all the aspects of the way 
(Kevorkian attorney Geoffrey) Fieger and Kevorkian operate.&quot;

Sutton said the van looks like the Volkswagen van that 
Kevorkian has used in the past.  The retired pathologist has 
been present during the deaths of at least 26 people since 
1990, while pushing his cause of doctor-assisted suicide.

Last year, Kevorkian, who is known as &quot;Dr. Death,&quot; attended 
the deaths of two people whose bodies were found in vans 
outside the medical examiner's office.

Sheriff's officials had had no contact with Kevorkian or his
attorneys as of Monday morning, Sutton said. Investigators 
were combing the van at 7:30 a.m.

Kevorkian's attorneys said little this morning. All Fieger 
would say was, &quot;Well, I don't own a van.&quot;

Kevorkian attended the death of Nicholas John Loving on May 
12. Loving suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease and died 
at the age of 27. His body was found in a van in the driveway 
to the medical examiner's office.

On November 8, Patricia Cashman took her life with Kevorkian 
present. Cashman had been suffering from metastatic breast 
cancer for three years. Her body also was left in a car 
outside the office.

Kevorkian faces trial February 12 on assisted-suicide charges 
in two 1993 deaths.
