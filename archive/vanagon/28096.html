Subject: It gets cold in Atlanta

Hi all,
Well I moved down here to Atlanta GA the heart of the south to escapre ever
seeing the thermometer register -30f, I am quite confident that I have
achieved that. But as far as an esacpe from the cold, well last night that
illusion crashed along with the mercury, which at my house hovered just
around 29f, now that is certainly not cold by the standards of any of you up
there in the north. But I have smuggly sat here deleting without reading all
the posts regarding heating the bus, thinking that I won't have to worry
about that. I froze my butt off last night driving in the bus. I had to stop
at a gas station to use the little hand dryers in the rest room to warm my
feet. I really would love to spend a bit of time with the engineers and
mangement who signed off on the &quot;heater&quot; in the bus. What the hell were
these people thinking? Does it not get cold in Germany or what? I can't even
begin to imagine how you all stay warm up there above the Mason-Dixon. So
the point of this, with my tail between my legs, any smugness ditched and
replaced by humility, could some one if they still have some of the articles
on heating a breadloaf forward them to me? I am not planning on needing to
heat it while sitting still ie camping but just having it be somewhere near
comfortable while driving.
Thanks and if anyone knows of any jobs in southern cal or fla for a web
designer please let me know :) woolily yours,
Scoob
