Subject: westy refrigerator

My recently acquired 81 camper has the three way fridge which I know works
beautifully on 110v and propane(it even made ice). Can anyone tell me an easy
way to see if it works on 12v short of driving around for a few hours. I know
there is power to the indicator panel but I dont believe there is any kind of
&quot;on&quot; indication.

Thanks for the help, Weston.
