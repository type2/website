Subject: I lurk, therefore I am...

Ok, I've been hangin' around this list since I found the gopher archive but
figured I better sign up.  Unfortunately, I've submitted several messages
before re-reading the listserv instructions about submitting messages from a
different domain than the one you signed up under.  I read the messages
_at_work.sux but joined the list using my private account.  Doh!  Ok, I've
changed my domainname at work...let's see if this works.

Ok, for Joel, I have a '67 Kombi camper (non-poptop, no sink, no stove, but
jalousie windows!) and
a '79 Bus (eight seater, bad paint, no power).  I'm in southern (way)
Maryland and haven't been able to locate ANY used parts down here.  I just
bought the '67 from a guy in the boonies in VA.  I answered an ad in the
Washington Post that read &quot;67 Transporter, could run&quot;.  Who could resist?

Here's my $.02 on the vanagon fanatic issue:  Vantagonists.  

'67 Kombi
'79 Bus
'86 Golf (bad tranny, make me an offer - I'm cheap)
'91 Jetta
