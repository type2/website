&gt;Greetings,
&gt;  I saw listed for $79.95 in the JC Whitney catalog the Volkswagen 
&gt;Vanagon Official Factory Repair Manual.  I generally buy all such manuals 
&gt;for vehicles I acquire.  So I asked a person who runs a service facility 
&gt;about this, and he called a local dealership for me.  He learned that 
&gt;they charge $70.30 &quot;trade wholesale&quot; for it and $84.95 &quot;list.&quot;  Then I 
&gt;checked a chain book seller.  It was interesting to find that their CD 
&gt;based information data base had three different spellings for Volkswagen, 
&gt;and each produced different outputs.  Beware if you chase data base info 
&gt;on these machines.  That effort showed a listing which is in a print-out 
&gt;before me.  The ISBN number that all book sellers will want to locate a 
&gt;volume is 0-8376-0336-6, and their publisher's code was 00003549.  This 
&gt;shows yet another price, $89.95.
&gt;  A local dealership employee said they'd disposed of all those manuals 
&gt;as they took too much room and are now on their micro fische.  Much 
&gt;anguish.  I know JC Whitney often includes catalog wide discount coupons, 
&gt;so their $79.95 becomes less 10% plus shipping.  Dealer wholesale is 
&gt;possible, to which tax would be added.  These are options.  The book 
&gt;sellers discount card price is still uncompetitive.
&gt;  OK, is this the best single book for maintaining and understanding 
&gt;Westfalias?  It's supposed to be 1200 pages.  If someone has a used copy 
&gt;they'd like to sell, I'm an interested party.  Perhaps someone else has 
&gt;some insights into my desire for documentation.  If so, please jump in.
&gt;	Thankzzzzzzz,
