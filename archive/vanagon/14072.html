&gt;My bus turns more tightly in reverse than it does in forward...why?

i'm not sure, but i think it has something to do with the &quot;rear&quot; being the
steering wheels (when you have it in reverse). i've noticed this with
forklifts and front-end-loaders. you have to be really careful steering them
especially with a load.

why this is true, i have not idea. maybe it's because the steering wheels
are not trying to &quot;plow&quot; ahead on their own, and therefore grip better. ??
