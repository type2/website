Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Joel.  This vanagon_at_lenti place is a lot
of fun when folks are level-headed and considerate.  Thanks for trying to
preserve that.  When it gets ugly, well...  

My philosophy is let's all try to get along...And if we can't let's pass out
guns and winner takes all!!  Hey, I want the big gun!!
