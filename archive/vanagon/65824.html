&gt; Thanks Joel,
&gt;
&gt; I forgot to mention that I did check for vacuum leaks, the only piece of
&gt; rubber hose is about 2 inches long at the end of a long hard plastic
&gt; tube on the front side of the manifold.   I wish it were that easy.
&gt;

Unless it's been modified, there should be another piece of rubber hose
at the other end the plastic tube (you've got to trace the tube up near
the wheel well).  Also, there's a short piece that rubs up against the
distributor cap in the middle (not connected to the cap, but rubs up
against it).  The boot by the air box can also be a source of vacuum
leaks.  For the 87s, they came out with a modified clamp that helps hold
the boot to the afm.

&gt; I just came back from resetting the timing back to where it belongs and
&gt; noticed that when I started up with the temp II disconected it ran
&gt; fine.  The temp sensor tested out fine with an ohm meter though.  Is
&gt; there a way to double check it?
&gt;

That sensor should only be $12 including the o-ring for the 86 (that's
what it cost from the dealer for an 87 and I think they use the same
one, earlier models are more expensive).  Is the labor to check it again
really worth it?  You might want to check the wires as well.  And
grounds.

&gt; &gt; try checking out the vacuum hoses ... one of them might be cracked. the
&gt; &gt; crack will sometimes close up as the engine warms up, sealing the leak
&gt; &gt; and making everything run ok. especially check the rubber elbow attached
&gt; &gt; to the Air Flow Meter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; good luck!
