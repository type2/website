Subject:  sweet revenge

Not so much on the revenge side, but I've wanted to tell someone about this
for years and this seems like the perfect place because it won't completely
sound like I'm tooting my own horn.
A few years ago when I knew nothing about my '74, I burned out the engine.
I bought another rusted out bus and switched the engines. I had the rusted
body in the old garage when a friend of a friend asked for a the
windshield. He said he would come by and get it and never did. About six
months later I saw this guy's bus with a new windshield, but a broken side
window. I biked home, got the window out of mine and at two in the morning
cleaned out the cardboard in his window swept up the broken glass he hadn't
cleaned and slipped in the window, pushed the button and locked the door,
and rode away. I never met this guy, but I continued to see his bus around
for about another year.
I've always imagined his surprised reaction in the morning.
So I loved the revenge story, but remember to be nice too, especially to
those poor souls who don't own a shoebow with wheels. They don't know what
they're missing.
