&gt; I bought my 85 Vanagon about a year and a half ago.  The AC has never 
&gt; worked and I am interested in getting it up and running again.  Any 
&gt; suggestions as to the least stupid strategy to attain this goal?  I 
&gt; merely want some guidelines to assist me when the dealer begins to take 
&gt; full advantage of my ignorance  ;-).  Many thanks.

My only suggestion would be to stay away from the old R-12 CFC type system.
And then when you figure out a cost effective solution for the new non-CFC
AC system let me know about it.
