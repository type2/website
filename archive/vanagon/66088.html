Subject:      signal to 85 Tach.

Can anyone tell me what the input signal is for the Tachometer on my 85
Westy?  When installing the subaru 2.2 in the Vanagon, the &quot;signal from t=
he
Subaru is too weak to drive the Tachometer.&quot;   Kennedy Engineering
recommends an aftermarket Tach, uck.

I would really like to use the Subaru signal on the existing Tachometer a=
nd
would consider an amplifier or signal conditioner to make it work.   Mayb=
e
a schematic of the existing VW computer output circuit would help, too.  =


TIA
