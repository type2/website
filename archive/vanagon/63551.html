I have a Bently Vanagon Service Manual for sale ($45.00 including
postage).

Last week my Vanagon lost all coolant on I-15 near Hesperia, California.
After a mechanic repaired the leak on the lower radiator hose, he told
me that the heads needed repaired (something I already knew about).
Since some un-named and unknown criminal stole all of my tools somewhere
in Houston, Texas, I traded my Vanagon in for a VW Jetta. I enjoyed the
Vanagon for the past 18 months but I couldn't afford the time or expense
to repair the engine.
