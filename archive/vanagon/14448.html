Subject: other vans - a test drive


the company that I work for has decided to lease a van. So the resident
beancounter narrowed the options (based on lease payments) to 3: Dodge
caravan, Chevy Lumina, GMC Safari. The VW dealer just laughed when she
outlined the amount we were willing to pay! Yesterday she arranged to have
the three contestants come to our office at 1 hour intervals, needless to
say they all arrived at once. 
So we had a look at the caravan first. Well you all know what they are
like, not enough room inside, driving position - acceptable but not ideal.
The inside was designed for the tastes of the average N.American which is
to say, not very inspired. I took it out for a spin, the V-6 pulled it
along well (can't get used to automatics!), felt quite car-like.
Next up was the Lumina, complete with the gelled-hair salesman. What a
mess that van is! The rear seats are a joke for someone of my height
(6'1&quot;), the front doors have warning stickers on the top corner so you
don't poke your eye out on them, I couldn't see the speedometer no matter
how I adjusted the drivers seat, my head scraped the roof, the fit and
finish was atrocious. Driving it was like driving some sort of airplane,
with the long nose and windshield, couldn't see where the front ended and
the windshield produced annoying interior relflections. The V-6 seemed
eager, with my left leg flapping uselessly and my right arm
feeling unwanted. It did have a ABS and two airbags.
The Safari was more like a van, lots of room and visibility, rode more van
like, but the interior fit and finish was baaaad. (the Caravan was the
best in this catagory) Four of us piled into this van and we sped away,
giving the salesman no end of teasing and abuse (the 2 GM salesmen were
just awfull, full of mis-information and bluster, we smart-ass scientist
types had no mercy! The dodge salesman was more of a humanbeing but I did
have to correct him on who invented the van. He claimed that Chrysler are
producing Caravans in Germany now, and they are selling well in Europe as
passenger vans, not work vans like the Transit, Eurovan et al).
In conclusion, I would not buy any of these vans for myself. The quality
is not there. My '82 Vanagon stands up very well to these models, I think
better in all areas except V-6 power and interior noise (all were nice and
quiet). The only thing that puzzles me is who buys the Lumina/Transport?
