Subject: Re: Anyone got a bike rack or towing hitch?

I never claimed that you could find some sort of mounting kit for 
&quot;vanagon rear hatch&quot;.  It is definately a custom job.  I am just saying 
that alot of people have figured it out.  Yes there are issues that you 
have mentioned.  I am not sure why the &quot;the sides of the top of the 
hatch are not parallel. &quot; causes a problem though.  Are you mounting the 
posts to the lip of the hatch or drilling through (so you can pick a 
place where everything will still be perpendicular).  As I think about 
it....I see the problem...there really is not alot of room to be 
drilling holes at the top of the hatch.

Anyway, if the rack is for the sole purpose of bikes then bag the rack 
and bolt fork mounts at the top of the hatch and use the mini rear wheel 
gutter type mount with the strap and bolt that to the bottom of the 
hatch.
