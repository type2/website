Subject:      What's Your Dream VW Bus?

Ian Cameron's recent request for info on various models of VW buses
suggested a question that I thought the list members might enjoy playing
with. To wit:

If money and availability were not issues, which VW bus (includes campers
and non-campers - any kind of VW bus) would you buy?

Which model from which year? And why?

Where's the first place you'd go in it (if it's a camper)?
