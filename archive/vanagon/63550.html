&gt;Hi Derek,
&gt;(you are a lucky guy - we didn't bet on some items dicussed in the last weeks. 
&gt;It wouldn't have been a fair game anyway as Seikel and SDP are only &quot;around 
&gt;the corner&quot; here)
&gt;
&gt;glad to hear that Seikel and Grabherr gave good hints. I hope that the news 
&gt;about US syncro enthusiasts will leak to VW AG as well - telling VWoA to take 
&gt;better care of you and making them think faster about a future T5 syncro 16''.
&gt;
&gt;But, Derek, do you really think you can really save money by ordering step by 
&gt;step. Wouldn't it be better to collect orders for stuff which is not available 
&gt;in USA like the wheel-wells, Seikel springs, 16'' rims, or whatever you may 
&gt;need. With such a &quot;Christmas list&quot; we could try to get some discount and ship 
&gt;it in one block ? Try announcing it on the list or throgh some of your free 
&gt;parts specialists.

I like the idea of waiting for a discount order en mass though I am too busy
right now to organize it. Also, I am very hot to get the wheelwells for 16&quot;
van and apply a sawzall to the fenders but feel that I should order two or
three sets at the same time so that I will have spares for when I break the
ones I put on the car. 

Here in the USA we usually use this VW dealer Cambelback VW in Phoenix who
charges just 20 or 30% over his cost and gives a big discount over normal
factory prices for parts. 

There must be a dealer in Germany who is similarly set up. Perhaps we should
just send a big, bulk email address to all German dealers asking which wants
business selling direct to USA and which has the biggest discounts. But you
must know this already Thomas, no?

&gt;BTW: I cannot fully agree wit Dan Houg !! Surly reinforced springs will 
&gt;enlarge the stress on the body. But as you told me you are loading your 
&gt;Vanagon up to three (metrical I assume) tons and VW has cut the 
&gt;complete-weight for the 14'' down to 2 300 kg for Off-Road use you simply get 
&gt;closer to the &quot;normal conditions&quot; with the stiffer springs.
&gt;
&gt;But Dan is completely allright: it doesn't make sense to use too different 
&gt;front and rear springs.

I have considered what Dan Houg said and have concluded that there is a lot
of merit in his statement. Since I am interested primarily in extra ground
clearance, and know the value of a soft suspension for slow speed off-road
driving, and since I am dubious about the idea of running stiff springs up
front and soft springs in the rear, I have concluded to not order the
springs at this time, but to wait until next February or so to make this
purchase. In the meantime, there are ways to raise the van up in the front
using the stock spring.

It does seem silly to pay full price for those springs and shocks and it
does seem like, if a group of us were to band together and place an order
for many units at once, that Sekiel ought to take 20% off the price in
return for that big sale.

&gt;He is right in another point - it's just an opinion.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;to the points now:
&gt;(...) more likely to get into a duty situation if you go through a commercial 
&gt;carrier. Last time I ordered parts from Europe, there was a stamp on the box 
&gt;saying &quot;Receiver is responsible for paying any duty&quot; and that was the last 
&gt;time I heard anything about it. The time before that, the postman just left 
&gt;the box in the hallway of my building here in New York, and I never saw him.
&gt;
&gt;4. The prices:
&gt;
&gt;        Front spring: DM243 each is $135 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $270 the pair
&gt;        Rear spring: DM315 each is $175 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $350 the pair
&gt;
&gt;        Front shock DM315 each is $175 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $350 the pair
&gt;        Rear shock DM208 each is $115 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $230 the pair
&gt;
&gt;        So you have a full setup of heavy duty springs and shocks for $1,200 
&gt;====
&gt;If you do it &quot;backstairs&quot; through the customs you may loose your VAT tax 
&gt;refound which I found already substracted in Seikels prices mentioned above. 
&gt;(German VAT is 15% at the moment ). You could also try to declare it as 
&gt;samples of no commercial value
&gt;===
&gt;5. I believe it is silly to get the rear shocks, as they are a standard sort 
&gt;of size, and it should be possible to find USA equivalents at cheaper prices.
&gt;===
&gt;Which is true indeed - from that point of view also for the front springs, but 
&gt;reverse-engeneering might be tricky because the springs are progressive. 
&gt;(Guess we alredy discussed that - did we ?)
&gt;===
&gt;49 6055 82731 
&gt;===
&gt;is ok.
&gt;===
&gt;Dunno what to do with that number, exactly.
&gt;===
&gt;You need to do some international money transfer - but Seikel should accept 
&gt;Master Card at least I guess

he says no

&gt;===
&gt;
&gt;Did you try at :
&gt;
&gt;projektzwo
&gt;Herr Rissmann
&gt;Saarburgstrasse 13
&gt;D 86899 Landsberg
&gt;Phone: + 49 - 81 91 - 92 77 - 0
&gt;Fax: +49 - 81 91 - 92 77 - 99

Uh...do you think they would have something different to say? I guess I
should try them. No, they never did send me their broschure.

&gt;Best regards Tom N.
