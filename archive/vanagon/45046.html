Martha                                                  June 14, 1996

I have a VW mechanic friend who has NOS (New Old Stock) factory 36 h.p.
Volkswagen engine case, made in Germany.  This is the case only.  He is asking
$650.  If anyone is interested they can contact him directly:
Karsten Meyer, 5538 Fulton Avenue, Sherman Oaks, CA 91401. 
Phone: (818) 994-3311.

Hope this helps someone who is looking for one.     ALAN SIMON
