Subject: CV joints


Since at least one of the CV joint boots on my 80' vanagon is more than 
cracked, I am planning on replacing all four of them, and check&amp;repack or 
replace the CV joints as well. Here my question:

Any experience/recommendations/options to rotate the CV joints 
(inner/outer or right/left or both) or even left and right driveshaft 
with CV joints to assure even wearing?
