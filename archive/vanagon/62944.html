          BE CAREFUL!!   the &quot;black lugs&quot; are for steel wheels ONLY! You 
          are now driving around with lug bolts that are not going down 
          into the rotor enough!  this could be dangerous.....
     
     You sure?
     
     My black front lug bolts (on factory 5-spoke alloys) have threads that 
     are at least 1-1.25&quot; long - takes plenty of turns to get them in an 
     tight.
     
     What pisses me off is that I don't have the black rear lug nuts.
