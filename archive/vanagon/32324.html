Subject: Grey late 60's or early 70's van on side of I-40 West

hey now,

well, after digging out from the snow i headed to work today....saw a vw van on
the side of the road buried in snow. it had virginia plates. seemd to be okay..
just wanted to let the owner know if he/she/they that their baby seemd to
be okay BUT that it has a tow notice on it!

i saw all years and makes of vws out on this snow and ice....they all seemed to
do extremely well.

take care,

jonathan
