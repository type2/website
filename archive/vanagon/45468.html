&gt; thanks for confirming this
&gt; 

But earlier she wrote:

&gt; 0 301 353 - ~ early sept 63
&gt;
&gt; 0 590 821 - ~ early june 64
&gt;

and concluded that the number referenced in my '64 Deluxe's warranty book 
(0 301 353) was in fact the correct and original number.

Now I'm confused.  Jim's reference listed the starting number for '64 
model (Aug. '63) 1500s as 0 578 878 (which puts my current motor number 0 
590 821 pretty darn close to Sept. '63  (the VIN plate date of 
manufacture for VIN 1165853)- - - - -

sorry- i think it was really late when i wrote that, as it it now, so i hope
i can elucidate my thoughts.    Your bus was manufactured sept 63, and the
number 0 301 353 jives with that.   I assume you do have the pull out cab
door handles, which means it is an early 64 model, buildt before 18 dec 63.

i was thanking jim for the 1500 us standard as of 64 model year confirmation.
  

0578878 motor number  was  about end of May production 1964.  sorry for not
looking more carefully at the numbers.
