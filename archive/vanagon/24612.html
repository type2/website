Subject: ???Vanagon engine replacement???

	Will be replacing my stock '86 vanagon engine with a &quot;longblock&quot;
from Jim Ellis VW (in Atl) when they can get one in.... 

	Questions:
1. On which nuts/bolts/studs do I use Locktight and on which should I use 
just an anti-seize compound?

2. Installing the clutch/pressure plate - how to correctly center without 
buying any special tool?

3. Any special treatment for the rubber hoses in the areas to be clamped. 

4. How much moly (?) for the throw-out bearing?

5. I plan to replace ALL the soft fuel line.  What is the best line 
to use?  (previous vanagon had a rather violent engine fire)

Thanks Joel
Thanks all
