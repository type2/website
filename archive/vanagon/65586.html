Subject:      84 Vanagon For Sale

Hi guys, my first post to this list so bear with me. What I've got is an
'84 Vanagon GL with some sort of engine difficulty.  It will runs, but only for
about 20 miles before overheating and bubbling stuff out of my overflow tank.
I've had mixed diagnoses(sp?) ranging from cracked head gasket to clogged
cooling lines.  My only problem with fixeing the damned thing is I'm moving
across state in a month and don't really have the time or money to fix it, nor
do I want to haul it around behind me again.  If someone has a quick way to
tell me what could be wrong that would be extremely easy to fix then please
do so.  If not, then I'd like to give it to someone who might have the time and
resources to take care of the problem.  The body is in good shape, a few bumps
and bruises, but overall good with very little rust.  The interior is in
excellent shape.  I would be happy to let it go for a VERY reasonable price.
Please contact me directly if interested as I don't always get to see all
these articles.  Thanks and peace!
