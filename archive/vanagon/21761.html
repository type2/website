Subject: O2 Sensor - lean/rich indicator
Date: Fri, 28 Jul 95 17:15:34 EDT

This is a question for the &quot;electronically inclined&quot; out there. How
difficult would it be to set up a three LED indicator that would tell the
driver if the O2 Sensor is reading rich, lean, or &quot;stochiometric&quot; for one
and three wire FI systems? Such
a device might be helpful as a way of assessing basic driving habits and
engine tune.

Thanks  for any ideas.
