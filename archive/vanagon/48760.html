Subject: Alternative fuels?


I just read a book on how to make and run you car on Alchol. In 1979 it 
was ilegal to use more then 50 percent alchol in your car on public 
roads, is this still true? Has anyone ever used alchol in a vw or other 
aircooled engine, how well does it work. It's supposed to be cleaner and 
cheaper, if you make it yourself that is. Just wondering, Thanks.
