Subject: Re: Power Steering


First I had Michelin 185 SR 14 car style wheels and I needed
strong arms to pass hairspin corners. Than I changed to a
light truck version and steering got much much easier. Now I
can do a hairspin with one arm. But the wheel I have at
present have bad handling on wet weather and side wind.

I'm searching for power steering since half a year, they are
not very common on our German market.

Power steering does not seem very common here in the UK. My 84 GL seems
quite a lot heavier in steering than the 82 Bus, both manual. The 84 GL
requires a lot of effort when parking. Do you think there is something
wrong? The buyer of the 82 Bus thought it had power steering because it was
so light.
