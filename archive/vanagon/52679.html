&gt;2.  I have heard there is a mountable Jump Seat that goes behind the 
&gt;passenger seat and mounts to the floor--seat belt and all.---I could 
&gt;really use one of these for that 5th passenger.

Hi, Joe, I don't have an extra &quot;console box.&quot;
Secondly, there is no such thing as a mountable jumpseat for behind the pass.
for a westy. I imagine if you really wanted one, you could take one out of a '87
up Wolfsburg/Carat/Multivan Vanagon, but the upholstry would be grey velour, and
wouldn't match your plaid material. I imagine you could also modify a fixed
jumpseat out of a '73 down westy, but the upholstry wouldn't match either. Or
you could do what I did, and just set the 4 legged stool ( Oh no - it's the 4
legged stool again!!!) from a '75 down westy right behind the pass. seat, and
use the back of the pass. seat as a backrest. Actually quite comfortable.
