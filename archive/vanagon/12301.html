Subject: Red Rock - Popular Place for Pathetic Pop (f)


Last night I saw an ad on my local (actually Seattle) PBS station for a
televised concert at Red Rock, starring that friend to bicycle road
racers and simple melody meister John Tesh.

Boy it sure looked crowded, what with all of the crowds, the Colorado
symphony orchestra, lighting and sound system.

Puzzled as to why people do these things,

Alistair
