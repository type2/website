Subject: Air 'Conditioning'

Howdy,

Well, I didn't use my air all last winter.  (I don't really believe in it,
but my van came with it...)  Read the 'use it or lost it' thread.  Used it
yesterday, but apparently I lost it.

Question:  If I don't do anything about this for a couple of years, will it
matter?  Does not being properly charged harm the system?

Ron
