Subject:      Re: technical drawings of transporters

I will forward your note to the mailing list for VW vans. Someone will
likely help you. Joel Walker comes to mind. Also, check out:

I have some of what you seek, but it is not easily available to me.

&gt;Dear Derek,
&gt;I am an architect living and working in London, and am currently
&gt;undertaking a design project which deals with the adaption of
&gt;vehicles to create architecture. I have chosen the Transporter as a
&gt;precedent study, and was hoping to get hold of some technical
&gt;drawings of the transporter in section, plan, elevation, etc. with
&gt;technical info too.....dimensions, loading capacity, etc. Do you know
&gt;how I can obtain such information? Your help would be really
&gt;appreciated.
&gt;I think your web page is great, by the way.
&gt;Adam Cowley.
