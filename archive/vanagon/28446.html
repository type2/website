yes!  A real Bus-Related POST!

Anyway, I did some beefing up of my heater system tonight.  I put
some of that foam pipe insulation, the black kind with the split in 
the middle, around the remaining un-insulated parts of the heater
pipe in my bus.  I had already done the big section in the middle,
and It Was Good, so I did the part under the front seat and pedals, 
and the area at the Y where the two small heater pipes meet at the 
back of the bus.

Before I did this, the heater vents up front would get hot enuf to
burn your fingers - can't wait to see how they do now!
