&gt;Hi Guys,
&gt;
&gt;My 86 GL make a buzzing noise that I hear somewhaere near the engine when I
&gt;accelerate onto the highway or when I really give her some gas.  There is
&gt;no noticable performance problem.  It sounds like an insect buzzing againt
&gt;a window. I wonder if it's the fuel pump working hard or maybe the sound of
&gt;the fuel injector control (first time I've had FI).
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Hi all:
I had a noisy fuel pump one time and I changed the fuel filter. Quieted it
right down.
