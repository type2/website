&gt; My next door neighbour is an Ad Rep for Arnold Advertising (VW's ad
&gt; agency).  His one and only client is VW.  I have left him a message to see
&gt; if he can get any surplus stickers or other promo items.  I'll post a
&gt; message if I come up with anything.

&gt; &gt;I still have several feelers out for some more of the elusive &quot;drivers 
&gt; &gt;wanted stickers&quot; that I recently gave away.  Just letting everyone know 
&gt; &gt;that I'm still looking, and haven't given up yet.  Called VW of US, no 
&gt; &gt;stickers, but they're sending me a catalog and a &quot;drivers wanted&quot; key 
&gt; &gt;chain.  The rep said he can send one-to-a-customer to whoever calls 
&gt; &gt;their 800 number (800) 822-8987.
