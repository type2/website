Well, since no one else has mentioned it I thought I would.  I would 
have to have one of those Ferraris that Hunter Thompson has in that 
hole outside of Aspen, Colo.  Of course I would either have to get him
to sell or have them make another one.  I am a bit thin on the details
but I am pretty sure it was a Ferrari.  4WD, big v-12, couple hundred 
miles/hr claimed top speed, and, the best part, a heavy machine gun 
or cannon mounted on a turret.  Now, give me just one of these babies 
and I think we can lay to rest all arguments about those other 'cars'.
