Subject: Blower Motors

Finished installing my &quot;new&quot; front blower motor today, I pulled it from
a wrecked 924 at my friends junkyard. Installation went well and now I
have heat up front :-)
	These are the models listed in the database at the yard for blower
motors for the vanagon
77-79 Audi Fox
82    Porche 924 turbo models
86-88 Porche 924
83-94 Porche 944
78-81 VW Dasher W/AC
82-88 VW Quantum W/O AC

	Removing one from the 86-88 Porche is a snap. One screw and it's out,
after you remove the plastic cover thats glued down.
