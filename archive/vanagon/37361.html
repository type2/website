Subject: Re: proposed posting title formats /f

Okay not Friday...  but ...  Not intended specifically to annoy Fred 
either...

&gt; Here's a suggestion that may make keyword searching of the archives more 
&gt; productive in the future.  What I'm proposing is that for common message 
&gt; types, that there be a standard subject line format.  for example, for 
&gt; reports on repair procedures, have a standard subject line heading of, 
&gt; 'repair procedure:  &lt;description&gt;', or for a list member's report about 
&gt; service recieved at a dealer or other shop, 'shop report:  &lt;description&gt;'. 
&gt;  Something along these lines may not only make archive searches more 
&gt; productive, but also help people screen their e-mail.

What do we put on articles about proposing subjects for articles?  How 
about proposals for splitting the list?  Okay and what about &quot;my 
generation is better than your generation&quot; flame wars?
