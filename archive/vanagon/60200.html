This black stuff is from an old filter.  You can remove the last bits of
it by taking out the vents in the overhead front section of the duct
work and vacuuming the duct work out.  Most of the stuff ends up in the
front section.  To remove the vents carefully put a screwdriver in the
side of the vent, there is a plastic spring clip that holds the vent in,
and pry out.
