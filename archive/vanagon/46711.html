&gt; 
&gt; Well I can't remember the name of the person who was selling us the plaid Westy 
&gt; Fabric from the Trim Shop.  Please send me an e-mail if you're out there.  Or if 
&gt; anyone else who was in on this deal can send me his adress.  Has anyone received 
&gt; their fabric yet?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to post this to both lists but I figured that there might be people 
&gt; involved in this deal that were on the watercooled list.
