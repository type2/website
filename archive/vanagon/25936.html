Subject: baja questions


Steve, Dave, et al:

Time to plan for Baja!  People are asking me questions regarding what/when/
where, and I have no answers, as I know NOTHING about Mexico.  Dave
Schwarze in the San Diego area has kindly volunteered that we can all
sleep in his living room (yay! - a slumber party!).  I think we
need a set schedule to determine when this will occur.  The dates
for the trip are set for October 25-30 or 31.  Do we want to meet
at Daves on the 25th?  Or later?

Help!
