Subject: re:  95 EV-Winnebago fridge problems

&gt;Wondering if any other EV-C owners have had problems with the Norcold
&gt;fridge in high elevation, 4-6,000 ft ?  It doesn't seem to get enough air
&gt;to light or stay lit.  I called Norcold today and they told me that I need
&gt;to have a &quot;Vent Kit&quot; installed, which means another hole in the side of the
&gt;van, yuck!
&gt;
&gt;Has any one else heard of this or had this surgery performed? Are there any
&gt;tricks that I should know about?
&gt;

I've never heard of this, and in fact had mine up in the Canadian Rockies
last summer at that altitude with no glitches at all.  (We were up on the
'Icefields Parkway' and spent a great deal of time at 6000 ft.)

Are you sure you don't have the shorted wire problem that someone else here
reported a few months ago?

&gt;Also, I read that others have had problems with the door locks going nuts,
&gt;ever any resolution?

When mine was new, the sliding door would occasionally &quot;not lock&quot; on the
first try - second try would do it though. Dealer replaced the motor, it's
worked fine ever since. (It happened only the first time when it had been
driven, so I figure something was just loose.)
