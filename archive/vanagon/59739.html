Subject:      Re: Spark Plugs -Tri Electrode / Factory Alloy (just one) wanted

On Sat, 10 May 1997 14:51:24 -0500 you said:
&gt;Is there any one out there using Bosch tri - electrode plugs in their
&gt;Vanagon and if so what heat range? I hava a set of W7DTC that I am thinking

i've been running the W7DTC for about 60,000 miles now and love them. :)

&gt;about installing - they look as if they may have a longer reach than the
&gt;stock plugs - any suggestions/comments? Also I am in need of 1 alloy wheel

yup. they are a tiny bit longer, but do not interfere with anything in the
combustion chamber.

so far, i'm very happy with them. but 50,000 miles is TOO long to leave them
in ... the electrodes had been pretty badly erroded ... worn enough that the
gap had just about doubled. but now, they were still working fine, even in
that condition. :)
