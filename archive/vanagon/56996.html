Subject: '81 FS near SF, lowered price


I'm lowering the price on my '81 westy near SF, CA:

1981 westfalia, ivory-yellow color
4 speed manual transmission
current/valid registration
factory air-conditioning
mileage:  138K
185R/14 Michelin XZX tires, newish, cable chains included
deluxe camper package; everything present and working
owned by non-smoker
rear seat has 2 _extra_ seat belts

add-ons/extras:  
guages - oil temp, oil press, cyl. head temp, volt meter
Bentley factory service manual
Citizen's Band radio - hard wired in, atop guage box
also, I had an external oil cooler added (this is set
to go on automatically if oil temps exceed 185F, but also
has an over-ride switch in case one wants to turn it on
in other circumstances)

upgrades/improvements since I acquired the car at 106K:  
new upholstery everywhere - including padding for beds
new engine, Mark Stevens heads
new clutch, starter, struts, CV joints, master brake cylinder
recent new paint - home job, but looks quite good; body is excellent
3 extra auxilliary batteries, including 2 golf-carts under rear seat
   front floor mats
 
I have all records since I've owned the car
Have had the car serviced/maintained regularly since I've owned it.
Have just had it gone over at the shop, and mechanic will be happy
to answer any questions you may have regarding condition of the
vehicle.  E-mail me if you'd like the shop's phone number.

Everything is present and operative on the car with the exception of the
following:

faucet knob top is cracked - works on tank water fine, though
missing front bumper end cap
fuel guage - works fine when full, but disappears to below E after 1/3 tank

Price:  $3,500 obo.  If interested, contact...
