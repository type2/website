Subject: plugging holes in tin

Hello all,
Well, I bought a generic floormat and proceeded to cut and slice and try to fix most of the awful gaps in the engine tin on my '78 around the a/c.  Since the a/c doesn't work anyway (compressor) I was thinking of removing the compressor entirely if I can locate that left rear piece of tin, which will probably never happen.

Anyway, I used the floormat and some adhesive putty I had lying around to fill the gaps the best I could, it's a pretty crude setup and I don't know how long it will hold up, but it does seem to be running a bit cooler now.

Wish me luck on finding a more permanent solution -- any ideas?

Sean
