Referring to the shift lever that pops out of the cup on the linkage, my
'67 had that problem as well. I got tired of messing with it after it
would pop out at the most inconvenient of times and places. I took the
lever out, and put 2 1&quot; washers on lever like so:
unbolt plate from floor. 
unscrew knob from the top of the shift lever
pull the boot off the top of the lever
put the 2 washers on the lever
replace the boot on top of the washers
bolt the plate back on with the pin aligned and the ball in the cup
this extra 1/4&quot; has kept mine in place for months now...
good luck
Richard
