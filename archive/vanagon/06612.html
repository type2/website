Somehow I've missed part of this. Can someone fill in a summary of the past 
issues?

I'll be moving back and forth on a route between TN and MO soon will this 
be close enough to be included?

Someone was asking for an assist in planning the East Coast portion of 
whatever THE GREAT TREK is now called. I've lost track of whomever.

Since school is out :)

I'll be having some time on my hands and may be able to help before the 
vacum gets filled. Someone guide me on this also.
