&gt;they were only in Ambulances (for obvious reasons) Before guages, there
&gt;was a 1 gallon or so emergency reserve tank. when your main tank ran
&gt;out, you just flipped a switch to go to the reserve tank, and then got
&gt;gas really soon...

There is a pull control, next to the choke pull, that operates a valve inside
the tank, which lets the last 1&quot; or so of gas in the tank flow into the fuel line.

This valve assembly screws into the bottom of the tank - I think you can 
retrofit them to later tanks - I'll look when I get home.
