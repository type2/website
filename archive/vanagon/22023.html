Hi Everyone.  Well, today I leave for vacation at 1400 hours... 
YIPPEE!!.  Going for 17 days to the Rockies, starting off with Mt. 
Robson Prov Park in BC (highest point in the Canadian Rockies), and 
off to Jasper, Banff, and Glacier National Parks.  We plan on doing 
lots of hiking, and R &amp; R.  

I'm remaining subscribed to the list for this time as I have already 
talked to our SysAdmin guy.  This will be a bit of a test to see if 
our popserver can handle all this volume :), and large files.

Have a good one,
Harry.
