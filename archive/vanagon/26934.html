Subject: Left Lane Idiots


To All:

While creeping across Oregon in Grendel at all of 40 mph, I often found
myself keeping up with the traffic flow, thanks to brain-dead types
homesteading the left-hand lane (I-5) is a two-laner in Oregon).  One such
case proved to be a Ford van full of cripples waving aluminum canes at one
another in a furious argument over something while they blocked traffic at a
stately 35 miles an hour.  It took over 30 minutes to get around them (ie,
about 20 miles).  Talk about a pile-up.

-Bob

PS -  At least one of the canes was white.  I hope it didn't belong to the
driver.
