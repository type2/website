&gt; What do you folks on the net recommend for shock absorbers?  The Bus in
&gt;question is a '70 that is driven 90%

on my old 1971 bus, way back when, i used to just use Sears (supposedly made
by Monroe). they'd last about 20,000 miles, but they were really cheap in
cost. they rode ok ... but then i tried Koni's and liked them much better.
they are adjustable (meaning that every 20,000 miles, you take them off, and
twist them one turn to 'tighten' them back up, and stick 'em back on the
car) and last a long longer ... like 80-100,000 miles. BUT! they are super
expensive ... like $80 each!!! &lt;my brother talked me into it the first time&gt;

&gt;OEM, KYB,
&gt;Boge HD, Bilstein, Monroe, etc. I ran Bilsteins on a '68 Bug before but
&gt;would like to know of other folks experiences.  Thanks in advance.

i tried bilsteins and didn't much like them (on a 88 vanagon). didn't last
but about 18,000 miles, and for the price, the sears/monroe or even midas
would have been a better deal.

i guess my only suggestion is: check around before you get them. the dealer
is definitely NOT the place to buy them. the bread loaf buses have a better
deal than the vanagons ... it's easier to find shocks, and they are a lot
cheaper.
