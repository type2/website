Subject:      Fear of Water ...

well, Old Bob has a valid point: i don't feel nearly as &quot;comfortable&quot;
working on my water-cooled bus as i did on my 71 bus or my 73 or my
80 vanagon.

it's the water. or more correctly, the coolant. and all them pipes. they
look like snakes. BIG snakes. just waiting. lying there, quiet, still ...
sullen and silent ... just waiting.

and when you get halfway under the bus, they'll drop down on you and coil
around you and choke you to death!!!!!

:)

... but mostly, it's cause i grew up with air-cooled. it made sense then,
and it makes sense now. and i learned about cars on them.

but then i went to the city ... and met wimmen who painted their faces ...
and found out about Air Conditioning and Water-Cooled Vanagons. and i was
seduced. :)

i LIKE the water-cooled vanagons. they have a lot of nice, comfortable,
convenient features and abilities.   :)

but they are not so much fun to work on. :(    but then, i don't like working
on ANY water-cooled car. at all.

it's the snakes, you see.

;)
