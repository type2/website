&lt;&lt; &gt; Yeah - no kidding - I spent all weekend pulling the engine, turned 'er
over
 &gt; so all the oil would pour out, got to thinking 'is it Friday?'.... so OK,
 &gt; next time I do it the easy way and roll the whole bus over, right???

 	You guys must be kiddin' me- I thought everybody knew the easiest way
 is to drive to China, that way you'll be upside down and
 the oil filler cap comes off easier and everything. If that doesn't work
 you got 2 billion Chinese to ask for advice. sheesh!
  &gt;&gt;

that's not the way to do it... everybody knows you suck the old oil out from
the filler tube with the trusty old Shop Vac. :&lt;)
