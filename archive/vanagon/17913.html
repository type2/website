Subject: Re: (f) Re: Cost of Eurovans?


You want to know what the real cost of owning a EuroVan is....

I blame it on Joel.....being of Polish Ancestry...I figured in order
for me to get on the &quot;vanagon&quot; list I had to have a vanagon...my wife
would only let me buy a new van...well no vanagons were available new
in 1993, so I bought the EuroVan...then a requested the listserv to
put me on the list....

I later found out that those sleazy scumbuckets Joel and Gerry allowed
ANYbody on the list...whether you had a bus...or you were (like me
pre-EV) a wannabus...

So as I figgure it Joel and Gerry owe me $21k for the price of admission
to this list, and Joel, and others owe me punitive damages in the amount
of $1,000,000 for the pain and suffering of having to read about
wannabusses, to deal with the Friday Follies...the late, lamented
Wil Self's ascii doodles...etc...


Pay up! or I'm gonna git you sucka!
