I dunno.  Perhaps, in his generosity, he was simply offering NOT to charge
you for the rust.

My favorite rusty bus was way back in about 1971 at Orange Coast College.
Don't know who owned it, but it was a 50's vintage (I didn't know from
barndoors in those days) non-sunroof.  It didn't need one, on the other
hand.  Rain gutter was rusted out about 8 inches up the top all the way
around.  Only the top bows held the top on!
