&gt;&gt;Oh, does anyone know for sure if the vanagon short block is *exactly*
&gt;&gt;the same as the 77-78 bus motor?  I could have gotten that vanagon
&gt;&gt;short block for $90, but I noticed the rear engine mount looked a
&gt;&gt;little different, and now I'm not sure the case is the same.

David:
Since you mention &quot;short block&quot;, I will assume you know about the differences in
the exhaust ports on the cylinder heads (Oval vs. rectangle). The cases are just
a bit different, but will interchange. The biggest difference yyou will notice
is the area where the oil breather is on the top of the case. On the Vanagons,
it is a tubular fitting/hole for the breather. On the older cases, it is a
rectangular, open area that a breather box is held onto with a bail clip.

I have used the older case (from a '79 2.0) on a Vanagon rebuild before, and
only had to modify the old-stlye breather to accept the Vanagon style fitting.
Worked fine, no problems. Hope this helps...
