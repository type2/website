&gt; Would love to, but it's too far, especially in the winter (brrrr!). Now,
&gt; what is this IRC thing &lt;and where can I get one? :-) &gt;

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat.  Basically, it's like the old &quot;CB
Radio&quot; theme that BBS's used to all have.  Except that IRC is free, and
worldwide.  At any given moment there are people online from 20 different
countries around the world, talking in realtime (well, almost).  There 
are hundreds of &quot;channels&quot; but the interesting one to us is #VW (channels
are all preceded by the # character).  There are many client programs
that connect to IRC, for many platforms, including Mac, Windows, and most
flavors of Unix.  On a Unix machine, try typing &quot;irc&quot; and if you get lucky,
you will see all kinds of interesting things.  Type &quot;/join #VW&quot; to join
the VW channel, where hopefully one or more of us will be.  For more
information, you can try the newsgroup &quot;alt.irc&quot;.
