Subject: Welding and Alignment Question
Date: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 09:43:03 -0700 (PDT)
From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;


I just aquired a barndoor rear section, conisting of the torsion tube,
frame rails (up to the point where they open up) and trannny fork
and the tube that goes underneath the tranny.

The parts I actually need are the frame rail sections; everything
else (in that area) on the existing car is still good.

My options are thus: do I cut the piece I need off the donor section,
or do I cut my entire old one out and weld the new one in?  If I go with
the latter, how in the heck can I make sure its aligned before I weld it
in there?  If I cut from the donor, whats the best way to cut it off
so I don't mangle the new piece?
