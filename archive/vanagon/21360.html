I mounted 3 Performance fork mount units (800-727-2453, $18 - normally  
used to mount onto their roof top bike carrier) to the rear of my pop  
top.  Other mfr.s such as Bike Tight (800-247-3843) make a better, but  
more expensive product.

I mounted 2 of the fork units about 28&quot; apart on the lower step of the  
pop top sandwiching inner and outer aluminum plates for strength.  The  
third fork unit is mounted in the same manner on the middle of the  
upper step of the pop top.  The bikes hang off the back with the rear  
wheels hitting at about the engine hatch hinges.  No rear wheel guide  
is needed as the quick release, gravity, and absence of any significant  
side to side forces conspire to keep the bike pointing straight up and  
down.  As a safety/security precaution, I bolted two stainless steel  
loops (?? - shaped like a capital omega) 2' down from the rain gutter  
on the apex of the body curve (above tail lights) through which I run a  
large diameter cable lock.  The cable runs through the rear triangles  
of all three bikes.

Yeah, you have to drill holes in your pop top (which don't compromise  
water proof integrity) and your body, but they're small and easily  
patched in the event that you no longer want the bike carrier.  No big  
deal.  You also have to take the bikes off to open the rear hatch or to  
raise the top (unless you convert the fork unit to have an axel instead  
of just a quick-release).  The benefits are that it's a really clean  
and convenient way to carry your bikes, it's relatively cheap, and  
you've made it yourself.  I've put this carrier to heavy use for about  
a year now and have found that the bikes don't move a bit, not even  
side to side.
