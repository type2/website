Subject: Water Around FI Computer

This is probally a Joel question, but after rains and car washings, water
collects in the trough area around the FI computer and dumps out when I
drive up an incline. I am thinkings there is a drain that may be clogged by
the driver side rear vent, but I can't see one. Help. Sooner or later water
and electronics don't mix.
