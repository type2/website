Don't expect any....assuming you have removed ALL the case-half bolts...
I knew of a guy who didn't remove the flywheel, and subsequently couldnt
remove...or at least didn't know the existance of the two small bolts
around the cam end...and smashed the case trying to split it apart...

once the bolts are off...get a rubber mallet or a piece of 2x4
and gently whack the two halves apart.
