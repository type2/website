Well, I picked up my wheels last fri. from the the mechanic for my
new rebuilt transmission.  All ran great, felt fine. and is.  This morning
on my way into work the starship began sputtering, while I'm pumping
the accelerator and no gas getting to the engine.  It stalls so I coast to
the side.  It starts so I go about half a mile and same thing.  Must be
the fuel pump is my guess.  So it's at the place it spends more time
at than in my driveway - the mechanic.  This could really jeapordize
the CCC trip :(  So far in the last year I've had to replace the Trans, 
clutch, master cylinder, and now probably the fuel pump?  Not much
else to do but a rebuild
