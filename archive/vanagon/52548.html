Subject: Have you replaced the Receiver/Drier in your A/C?


My mechanic is doing work on the A/C system of the 86 Syncro. He has
detected a very small leak in the system at the blowoff plug of the
receiver drier.

Typically, the blowoff plug does not just seep, but rather it opens
and all the freon leaks very quickly. On a catastropphic failure like
this, the system will not hold any pressure. That is not what
happened. The system will hold some pressure but it leaks out over 24
hours.

FYI, this receiver drier was replaced in June this summer.

He has some theories on the cause of the problem here, but to verify
his ideas, we need some feedback from owners of 86 and up
Vanagons. What we want to find out is the turnover rate of receiver
driers due to the blowoff plug failing.

So, if you have had your receiver drier replaced and it was replaced
because the blowoff plug failed, let me know. I must stress that a
receiver drier is sometimes replaced because the desicant is &quot;full&quot;
of moisture. If this is the case, you don't need to let me know about
your receiver drier replacement.

Secondly, if anyone has replaced the expansion valve of the A/C
system, please let me know.

Thanks in advance.
