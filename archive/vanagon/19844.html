From: Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;
Subject:      question: location (geo(graphical)) list ... ???

it has been suggested that i provide a geographical Who's Where (or maybe
What's Where) list, similar to the Who's Who posted yesterday. it would
look like this:

Rooster Cogburn *71 Bus Camper      AL Peachtree   Rooster_at_goodolboy_dot_net
Dufus Pigwallow *93 Vanagon Turbo   AL Birmingham  imadumbass_at_aol_dot_com
Joel Walker     *88 Vanagon GL      AL Tuscaloosa  jwalker_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu

and, of course, be sorted by state and city. countries other than the u.s.
would be grouped according to continent. :)

but the question is: do you guys mind if i do this. i don't want to get
toooooo free and easy with what some of you might consider private info.
it's one thing for me to post the stuff like AL - 3  or NC - 14 on the
Weakly Stats, but this is a little different and some folks might be a bit
... i don't know, &quot;uneasy&quot;???

see, i'm a little paranoid myself, ;) so i can understand any reluctance to
Little Brother spreading this kind of info all around.

anyway, if ANYONE has objections to it, i won't do it (or i can delete your
info individually) ... so any Objectees out there, let me know. i'll wait
until tomorrow or Friday to get the Digest Mode folks time to get a vote in.
