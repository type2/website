Subject: Re: The Tehachapi Run/milage

Since It's been a few weeks since I posted a reminder to the list about
the Hoover Sermon Web Page, http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/, I may as well
send this to the list, as well as paulc_at_esslink_dot_com.

To ask questions about the Web Pages, write me at rmk_at_sky_dot_net.  Questions
about sermon content should of course be referred to Bob himself, at
Veeduber_at_aol_dot_com.

Thanks again to Bob for writing both his technical posts as well as his
&quot;adventures&quot;.  I enjoy them both and hope the negative mail Bob has been
getting is far outweighed by positive mail.
