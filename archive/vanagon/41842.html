Subject: Alaska Highway on Discovery channel

Hi folks,
        Just watched a show on Discovery channel this evening (11-12 Sun.
night CST) about the making of the Alaska Highway. I had no clue that it
was made in '42 for the war effort. Anyway, the show was real interesting,
and had lots of *georgeous* scenery. All kinds of interesting information
about the Army core of Engineers building it too. They did it in 10
months-now that's fast. Anyhoo, the show was called &quot;Rediscovering
America&quot;. Watch out for a repeat, it's worth the time.

        VW content? Duh! A bunch of us idiots are driving a healthy portion
of the highway...   &quot;North, to Alas-ka, Goin' North, the rush is on...&quot;
(Johnny Horton, 1961?)

Peace,
