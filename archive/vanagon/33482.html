Subject: Cali Car

Its official. My car passed smog and now is sporting Cali plates. 
WHEW! what an ordeal. Passing smog wasn't without pain though. 
It failed hydrocarbons. They replaced the catalytic converter (at a 
hefty price) and showed me my old one. It was hollow. Just a shell. 
They did have to reset the idle to get it to pass, so now the car 
idels a little rough, and stalls sometimes, if you park with no gas peddle 
action.

A new problem has cropped up though. While starting the car, I 
believe the starter makes a horrible noise (like trying to start your 
car when its already running.) And last weekend it almost didn't 
start. I believe I will need to replace the starter. However, The 
Main Branch of the San Francisco library is closed until April, so I 
can't get my hands on Bentley!

Is this an easy procedure? Could someone walk me through the process? ( personal 
email is fine so as not to waste bandwidth here)

Thanks
