&gt;I have seen a few vechiles (Hot Rods) that have the capibility to 
&gt;shoot 5 to 15 foot flames out the tail pipes. This is acomplished 
&gt;with a sparkplug in the pipe and doing something to the fuel mixture. 
&gt;Or for the wealthy folk you can sometimes find a kit with a 
&gt;presurized fuel squirter. I always thought that would be pretty 
&gt;effective in getting rid of tailgaters. Might get a little 
&gt;interesting with the &quot;unique&quot; V.W. exhaust system.

Why, what with surplus JATO rockets, tazers, paint ball guns, radiator
wrecking balls, etc, why don't we just get some surplus flamethrowers
and mount them down by the tailpipe (for that added &quot;sporty&quot; look) and
then just roast the guy when you tire of him/her hanging around your
bumper?!   ;-)

And speaking of signs, how about something like this (for VW Type2 owners
only)

You know the &quot;Slower Traffic Keep Right&quot; sign for the top of the windshield?

Well, ours would be mounted on back &amp; it'd say &quot;Faster Traffic Keep Left&quot;...

And if you have a REALLY big window (or hatch):

&quot;Don't tailgate, or I'll stand on my brakes, causing you to ram me, and
making
me so pissed off that I'll rip your throat out and shove it up your nose...&quot;


Whoa!...  my medication must be wearing off, but I feel MUCH better now!

Happy Friday!
