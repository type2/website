&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently purchased a Turbo Muffler from S &amp; S (602-847-9000).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; S&amp;S manufacturers a top quality Turbo Muffler and tail pipe
&gt; &gt; &gt; combination
&gt; &gt; &gt; for Vanagons.  I put one on my 1984 H20Boxer and, while slightly more
&gt; &gt; &gt; noise, gas milage improved by at least 1.5mpgh.  Better yet, the
total
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; cost is less than the replacement anywhere!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; They also make headers that are high quality and reasonably priced,
&gt; &gt; &gt; much
&gt; &gt; &gt; cheaper than replacing all of the broken Volks header pipes.  Allows
&gt; &gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt; converter to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you call mention Davidb and you'll get a discount.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any idea if their headers will fit a Syncro?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; '86 GL Syncro
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My guess is they've got them.  check out their home page or give them a
&gt; call.   Ask for Betty
