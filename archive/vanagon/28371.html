Can I have a hug, martino?  No wait, &quot;YEAH Martino!  yer goddamn right!
Those guys annoy me!  Let's challenge them to a game of tackle football!

Ya know, seeing a girl on the pages of a VW mag. is really degrading to
humanity.

&gt; I think I'll puke!  Lighten up... 

Here's a towel, clean that festering mess up, will ya?  Hmmm... makes me
wonder what you were &quot;eating&quot; earlier today.  Did you ever stop to think
that you're the one that needs to lighten up?

Probably all content with their SO's, unlike the people that read VW
mags because of semi-naked women.
