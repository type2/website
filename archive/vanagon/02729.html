&gt; Unfortunately, none of the phone books I have access to list either NTW
&gt; or Tires America.  I'm getting curious about the $60 price, since I called
&gt; Sears last night, and they have them for $81.69.  You guys wouldn't have
&gt; bought these tires during a &quot;buy 3, get 1 free&quot; sale, did you?

I went into my local Sears today to look at these.  The Michelins are 
priced at $79.95.  They also had some Roadhandler (Sears brand made by
Michelin) all-terrain radials in the same size (195/75/14) that supposedly
had the same reinforcements as the Michelins (6 ply, I guess?) on sale for
$59.95!  They are lite truck tires with an agressive tread pattern, which
should be great for dirt roads.  I felt up the sidewalls (ooh, baby!) and
they were indeed, very, very stiff.  I think these would be great tires
for the busses!  I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get two of them, but not right
now cause my current tires still have lots of life in them.  Check 'em out!
