&gt;&gt;Do the plastic (that used to look like chrome) strips that are inlayed in
&gt;&gt;the window seals on my '85 Vanagon serve any useful purpose?  They have
&gt;&gt;discolored and look kind of nasty now and I'd like to just take them out.
&gt;
&gt;Nope, thems just thar to look purty.  You will have a gap for a while, until
&gt;the rubber shrinks back down and fills it.  It won't leak though.
&gt;
&gt;er ah be careful bunkie...
&gt;
&gt;That funny little trim strip is a compression device that keeps the rubber
&gt;window seal in.  To remove the window easily, pick out the trim and simply push
&gt;gently on the window from the inside or even from the outside.  If the trim
&gt;is not installed the window seal is &quot;unlocked&quot; and can fall or be pushed out
&gt;very easily as the only thing holding it is stiction from the old rubber to
&gt;the body paint/rust.  With the trim installed, you've gotta break the window
&gt;to get it out.  Ask any of Thom's &quot;friends on the street&quot; who visit his bus
&gt;on occasion.

I had similar ones on my old VW's, and never had a problem yanking them
out.  Maybe those were different.  Never had a vanagon.  Never seen
trim in a split window bus windshield.
