Subject: disconnect 02 sensor
Date: Mon, 17 Feb 1997 13:02:57 -0500

Hi All,

I just met a fellow at lunch who also has an '86 Vanagon, pretty much a
mirror image of my wife's! Anyway, we were speaking of problems, etc. and
he asked if I had ever had to replace my 02 sensor. I said no and asked why
and he said his went bad and his mechanic (the same VW dealer I battled
with over the ECU) simply disconnected it. He said he didn't notice a
difference but was worried of the effects. He said the dealer said it was
only for emissions. I thought it also served a purposed on telling the ecu
how the engine was running, as in too rich, etc. Does anybody have any more
info?

tony
