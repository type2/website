Hi All,

More questions.

It is my understanding that the water-boxers from '83.5 --&gt; '87 had some
design flaws resulting in head leak problems, but the '88 --&gt; '91
water-boxers had this problem fixed.

Questions:

Will an engine from an '88 --&gt; '91 Westy bolt right into the '83 --&gt; '87
Westys?

And if so, what will one pay for a good rebuilt '88 --&gt; '91 Westy engine?

Are new '88 --&gt; '91 engines available?  How much?
