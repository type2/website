&gt; &gt; The Power Steering Unit has a 2 wire connection to the electrical
&gt; &gt; harness that crosses the back of the engine compartment.
&gt; (snip)
&gt; &gt;
I finally tracked down the harness meltdown...the powered lead must have
caught 15000voltsfrom the arcing plug wire...it ended up going into a
relay in the highpower ignition box above the coil.......the relay seems
ok though...


We adjusted the timing after top dead center....and still ge a miss on 
one of the cylinders every now and then...the distriubutor has a little
play in it...bearings must have go hot when the heads blew...
My new cap and rotor get a little uneven wear....

How much is a new distributor...and does anybody have a used one thgqat
is in good order that I can buy....Also is it hard to replave them?
It appears somple but I would value other opinions...
Thanks John in FL.



&gt; &gt; WHY does the ps unit have wires...is it a sensor?
&gt; &gt; where do these wires lead?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; fry my  computer chip?
&gt; 
&gt;     The 2 wires on the PS pump are there to raise the idle in the
&gt;     event that the pump overloads the motor and starts to bring down
&gt;     the idle. If you short 1 or both, to a plug wire!!! Who knows!!
