&gt; 
&gt; 	This thread on the venting has reminded me that I have never 
&gt; quite figured out my &quot;Pandora's Box&quot;.  I do plan to dig into it soon, but 
&gt; I have one question;  is the dash fan used only for the side vents?
&gt; My Westy also sends out heated air at all times, but I attributed it to 
&gt; the mess the previous owner made when he removed the air cond.  
&gt; 	Anyway, if anyone can answer this simple question, I would be 
&gt; much abliged.

The fan will blow air out any vent that is open and has the control lever
set for that vent to have vented air including the vents over the sliding
door.  Wow I used the word 'vent' four times in one sentence. ;)
