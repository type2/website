&gt;	I presume there is a nose-gasket I should have replaced before
&gt;we put the engine in, sigh. Anyone here done this, know about it? 
&gt;Looks like I lost about a cup of oil sitting at idle for 20 minutes,
&gt;so when I get the lights working, the truck can be moved but
&gt;hardly used as a daily driver until this is fixed. Its raining again :(

Let me know if you have trouble pulling the nosecone off while it is 
 still in the bus. I developed a good butcher technique to do this.
