effective.

Since one of the reaction products is molten iron, railroads use it to weld 
tracks together.

My high school chemistry teacher demonstrated the reaction (so that WE 
wouldn't I guess :-)

It's dead easy and not recommended.  Mr. Schuyler's demonstration (with a 
total mass of ONLY about  5 grams) burned through a carbon crucible, an 
asbestos pad and halfway through the lab bench.

When folks say &quot;don't try this at home&quot;, sometimes it's a good idea to heed 
the warning.
