Subject: Newbie question

OK, Now I want you all to know that I FULLY expect to be made fun of for
this but that's ok. I kind of like that about this mailing list.

Anyway, I am a brand new Vanagon owner and am wondering what the differences
are between an '87 GL and an '87 Wolfsburg. What makes it a Wolfsburg?

I know. I am retarded. 

Humor me :b
