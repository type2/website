Subject: Re: question about Macs and VW relation

This whole thread makes me wonder if we should ask Joel to take stats on 
computer use as well (obviously we are all using some kind of computer), then 
we could compare the percentage of VW owners that use Macs vs. PCs and see if 
it comes out to be similar to the Mac marketshare which is somewhere between 3 
and 7 percent world-wide.  Other values of variables could be the type and 
number of VWs and the type of Macs or PCs owned/used.  Likewise we could look 
at gender, age, years of ownership, type of employment or school status.   Any 
one want to run an ANOVA or other statistical analyses on the results?

Hey, come on now it's FRIDAY!!!

88 GL, Toshiba Tecra 700CT, 1 VW GL, &gt; 10 PCs (though I used to use Macs back 
in college), etc.
