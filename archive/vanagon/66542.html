&gt;Hello Chris:  I am still trying to import an 94 EV Westfalia from Canada.

You might find it easier to do as I did-marry a Canadian citizen.  It opens
up all sorts of possibilities for the importation of Canadian vehicles for
personal use in the US. I know it's not Friday, but couldn't resist.  And
for those of us married to Canadians, there are certain exemptions that
apply for Canadian citizens residing in the US regarding the importation of
vehicles.  I have some of the details of these if anyone is interested.
