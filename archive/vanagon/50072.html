Yessiree, There's nothin' worse than gettin' beened by little turds at 60 mph!
And, I must say, a good degreasing of the heater boxes at this time will also
keep you from having to smear that oily film all over the inside of the
windshield with a little wadded up Kleenex while trying to keep from passing out
from the wonderful aroma of burned 20W50 wafting thru the defroster vents.

Happy Friday, 
chris
