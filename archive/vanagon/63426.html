Subject:      Proud New Owner...

Just wanted to say a quick &quot;thanks&quot; to all the people who contribute to
this list, the archives, and all the other great vanagon info on the
net.

I just picked up my new Westy (my first!!) this morning, and a lot of
the pre-purchase inspection was from knowledge gained from this list.  I
cannot wait to go camping!

Also, a huge public thank you to those who responded in such great
detail when I inquired about a '91 syncro Westy a while back.  Although
I ended up now buying it, I really appreciated the comments!

Now this:    AK.ANC       3

The stats suggest that there are only three people in Anchorage on the
list; Who are you?  Send me some email so we can trade stories about
good/bad mechanics/parts places/etc!   Also, we (Anchorage people) need
to get some more list members from Los Anchorage.  Fairbanks lists four
members.  Certainly we don't want to give Outsiders the perception that
Fairbanksians is more concerned with their vans than Anchoragites, do
we??
