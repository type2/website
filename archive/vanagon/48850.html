Subject: 80W90 GL-5 for AT final drive?

I know this is probably an absurd  attention to detail but here goes:

The final drive for an auto transmission vanagon ('86) specifies SAE 90
GL-5 grease but I've not been able to find any.  Will SAE 80W90 GL-5 offer
the same protection?  How about some quick professional help?
