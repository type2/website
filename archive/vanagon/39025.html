I keep my bikes inside the westy on a self made system.  I can carry 
three bikes and they are not exposed to road damage, don't put undue 
weight on the back end, and I didn't cut holes in my roof for a rack!

&gt; i too would like to know which is the best bike rack, i don't have a

&gt; the defacto standard for the vanagon that i've seen is the one that clamps
&gt; the the front bumper and wobbles all over the place unless you bungee the
&gt; whole rig to the van after the bikes are in place (my van came with one,
&gt; but i threw it away)
&gt; i would like a rear one...
&gt; 
&gt; i remember someone saying that the thule one is best, but i can't remember
&gt; specifics...
