&gt;Now, now Thom, if your data is to be reliable we would also need to know
&gt;how many junked busses you have seen that don't have GEX engines. Only then
&gt;could we determine if your &quot;sample&quot; is representative of the population.
&gt;Still we could never be too sure if the busses were junked because of
&gt;engine failure. David C. 

True.  But the GEX motors are the only ones I can recognize.  They _all_
had cracked heads, BTW.  None one the buses in question had any significant
structural damage (ie rolled)
