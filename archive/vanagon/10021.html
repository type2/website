Subject: Re: distributor

&gt;
&gt;I think I have problems with my distributor. With low rpm the centrifugal 
&gt;adjustment (Fliehkraftverstellung) sticks and with higher rpm, 
&gt;sometimes it is all fine.
&gt;
&gt;Now, my manual says you cannot disassemble the distributor. But I doubt 
&gt;this. Did anybody already disassemble his distributor? Any problems or 
&gt;difficulties?
&gt;
I once had a bug that ran rough whatever I tried. I eventually found that 
the centrifugal advance was jammed solid. Once I took it apart and cleaned 
and oiled everything it ran fine. If I remember, you just drift out the pin 
at the end of the shaft and the whole thing comes apart easily. I think the 
jobs described in the Haynes manual.
