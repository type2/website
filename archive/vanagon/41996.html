&gt;hey, how hard is it to put in curtains in a Vanagon? I know campers
&gt;get 'em but  I'd like em in my non-campmobile; if &amp; when I hit Vegas

not hard at all. i got mine from Z-Products (up in Oregon) for $130 ...
which will make you sick when you see how simple &quot;curtains&quot; are to make
from plain cloth. :) the kit has aluminum rod at the top, bent slightly
at each end (so the part the curtain slides on is held out away from the
bus interior roof). it has an elastic cord at the bottom ... each end is
looped and held together with a copper clamp/crimp. both the alumninum
rod and the elastic cord ends are held to the bus by sheet metal screws.

the only &quot;problem&quot; i had was the rear hatch glass. the aluminum rod was
just a tad too long for the top of the glass, so i trimmed it and relocated
one screw hole (so they matched up with the screws that hold the ground
wires of the rear window defrost).

one thing i have noticed: i figured light colored fabric would be best ...
reflect the heat, you know. yeah, well, maybe ... but what it does do is
let a LOT of light inside. darker fabric would make it darker and easier
to sleep in wal-mart parking lots. ;)
