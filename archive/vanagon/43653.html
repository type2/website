Greetings,
  I'm new to this list, but I already have enjoyed reading all the posts.  I've 
recently purchased a '72 Westy.  A kid I know has had it in his  neighbors 
garage for the last couple of years and now his neighbor is selling the house 
and he has to get rid of it.  The engine is bad (no compression but it turns) 
and there is some rust in the rocker panel sections.  The body looks straight 
and the interior is intact.  I offered him $300 and he took it so now I'm stuck.
I had a '65 Beetle back about 1977 and did everything that one could do  to a 
Bug.  So I'm no virgin.  I'm sure that I'll be asking for advice many times in 
the future.  In the meantime I'll just read and try and learn something.
  One interesting thing today here in the State of Minnesota.  We have a liberal
U.S. Senator here by the name of Wellstone.  The Republicans, in an effort to 
embarrass him plan on following him around in a '67 VW Bus.  They claim the Bus 
is supposed to represent the obsolete liberal past.  I saw the thing on TV and 
it looked nice.  I mean the thing is damn near 30 years old and it still goes 
good.  Looks cool too.   Maybe I just didn't get it.  See ya all on the road in 
a year or two.
