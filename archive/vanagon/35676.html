Subject: More on Wasserboxer cooling flush


G'day all

Looks like I'm hooked, so I am going to do it all, and make sure it is 
done right! (had a bad experience long ago with a mechanic who knew less 
than me and I was only 17! Many motor/auto/panel/paints since then)

1. I'm told that the coolant is extremely toxic. What do I do with the 
old stuff?(I dont want to polute waterways but I want the job done 
properly)

2. I would really like to get a copy of the Bently manual that isn't 
gold plated ($240 US here). Could someone please help me?
