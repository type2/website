Well, I finally have time to tell you-all about my latest
problem and fix of the broken steering lock and wiper controls.
And no, I didn't fix it, I took it to the dealer.  My excuse
is that I needed to get the car smogged anyway, so I thought
I might as well have them check out the messed up steering
column stuff.

Sooo.... 

A few months back during one of the many rain storms I noticed
that my wiper switch wasn't operating properly and that when
I tried to use the intermittent mode, I couldn't pull the handle
down to position for that mode.  When I got a chance to look
at it, I'd noticed that the obstruction was the steering column
cover itself.  Well, I surmised that things got twisted inside
and it was probably from the way I get into my van.  I used to
use the steering wheel as a way to help pull myself up and into
the bus.  And by doing so, over time with the steering wheel
locked, this constant stress eventually miss-aligned the mecha-
nisms inside.  Well, I thought, one of these days I'll have to
have a look inside to see how to realign the wiper switch.  Now
keep in mind the steering lock still worked and the turn signals
were fine as was other wiper functions.  

So as I post-poned and delayed the fix, I had some other fun 
problems like when I tried to use the rear wiper/washer, the
sprayer just kept on spraying and fluid pump kept on pumping.
I fiddled with the control until finally I found that the only
way to stop it spraying was to make a complete stop and shut
off the engine.  The problem occured on the freeway and so I
figure I had the constant spray on for about a mile or so.  Must
have been fun to see from behind.

Well, along comes my DMV renewal notice and of course they want
to have a snort of my exhaust to see how good of a buzz it produces.
Well, as I'm not a certified mechanic the last time I checked my
credentials, I decided to take it to the dealer. (Lasher VW
in downtown Sacramento.  I took it in on last Monday morning 
with a pre-arranged appointment and gave the official service
person my description of what was happening and what my percieved
diagnosis of the situation.  Of course, I got the look of &quot;what
the hell do you know and we won't know what's what till be get
a paws on it.&quot;  So he wrote up the invoice and I had the stinking
suspicion that large expenditures were in my future.

Well, later on at work I got a call and as previously suspected,
the diagnoses wasn't good.  I was told I needed a new steering
wheel lock, a new wiper control mechanism and possibly a new
turn signal mechanism.  Ugh!  No suprise there.  So he gave me
the cost figures for these replacemnet gems and after I pulled
myself up off of the floor from large dollar figures quoted, I
weighed the amount of the parts and labor in my head and decided
that another $90 of their labor was worth it to have them do
the replacing.  So I gave him my blessing as I wiped back the
tears and hung up the phone.

Later that morning, I was told that the part(s) were not available
from any of the parts houses in town so they'd have to be ordered.
Ugh!  Well, that meant I had to leave my van and drive the Sentra
for another day.  So I okayed that and read more VW email....err got
back to work.

So tomorrow became today and in the middle of the day I got to won-
dering what was the situation about the van.  So I gave them a ring
and the service person said that my car would be done in an hour.
Fat lotta good that does me, I don't get off work till 5:00.  He
gave me the lo-down on the actual cost and it came out to $314.00
for the whole schmuz.  Smog, replaced wiper control and replaced
steering wheel lock.  I told him that I wanted the old parts and
he said he would comply.  

As my work is quite a way from the dealers lot I decided to leave
at 4:00 instead of 5:00 so I would be sure not to be too late to
pick up the van.  As I pulled into the lot, a middle aged gentleman
was just getting the last words of VW spiel from a salesman and was
departing in his brand spankin' new EV camper.  Nice white paint,
self-contained heater and all.  

I paid the paperwork clerk, headed over to my van parked way in the
back of the lot.  There was a nice red EV parked to the rear and
right of my van.  I decided to have a peek inside.  It was of the
multivan type.  It'd be a nice compromise if I had to hall around
many people.  Not me!   

Got in my van and turned it over.  Ahhhhhh Funkengruvin.  

  &quot;I missed you baby.&quot;  
  (I missed you too.  Don't EVER leave me with those, those
   sheisters again!)  
   &quot;But....but&quot;
   (You heard me!)  
   &quot;Well, I'll have to think about it, but I'll try.&quot;
   (Hmmmf!)
   &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;

We bonded and drove off and got my wife and returned her to her
car and headed off for dinner.

When I checked out the steering lock, it had separated along the
top right portion.  I couldn't believe I had done that, but there
was no other explanantion.  I couldn't figure out what was broken
on the wiper mechanism, so I'll have to keep it and maybe it can
be rehabilitated.  

So, if you want to do good by your van.  Don't be hoisting your-
self in using the locked steering wheel as leverage.  I've paid
the price.  Will you?
