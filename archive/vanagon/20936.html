Folks

I have been reading about the driving of aircooleds in hot weather
and watching the engine so that it doesn't overheat...

Now as we discussed last year, aircooled engines remind me a great deal
of general aviation airplane engines (aircooled as well). One of
the symptoms of overleaning an aircraft engine is the engine oil
temparature rising, and one solution is to enrichen the mixture...

..It seems that unburned hydrocarbons take heat away with them as they
are exhausted out the manifolds....

So, I was wondering if enriching the mixture might be a short-term
solution for those Arizona-hot days we have been experiencing in the
States...

p.s. My radiator fan actually came on for the first time this 
last week. Scared the dickens out of me. Now *that* is hot...
