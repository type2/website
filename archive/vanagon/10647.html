Subject: 84 VW Warranty work or Not


Just bought a 84 VW. The head gasket leaks. For the heck of it I decided to
call VW
to see if some sort of warranty work could be done. I'm the third
owner,/94,000 mi.
They said that they could not tell me if they would be able to pay for part
or all
of the work until an authorized VW repair shop performed an engine diagnostic.
The cost is $500. It was explained to me that they pull the engine and check it
out. If the engine has a bad head gasket etc. VW then makes the decision on what
kind of assistance, if any, they will offer, but I must pay the $500 diagnostic.


Now since I intend to have the gaskets replaced anyway, I now find myself
waffling
over getting a diagnostic for $500 and maybe (big maybe i'm sure) getting
the engine
overhauled and possibly having VW pick-up the 'Secret Warranty' work or
springing for 
the head gaskets myself at a good reliable shop for about $6-800.

Opinions? Counseling? Imaparting of sagacity?

Thanks!
