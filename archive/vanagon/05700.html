A couple of followups. I would recommend not buying from a dealer IF price
is a major concern. Why? Because they invariably inflate their prices and
unlike individuals are not in a pressure situation to sell (for money or
space) and therfore can afford to have the camper sit on the lot. Even if
it is a true Westfalia you can do better on price. Check the SF Chronicle
and other west coast newspapers. On any given day there will be at least 3
Westfalia's for sale. BTW The price they are asking is what you should pay
for an 84 or later wasserboxer....

On the brakes - this is a worry. They should not be mushy, could be  air
in the system or a poorly operating system. A simple test, park on a hill
and see if the hand brake holds. See if this stalls the engine in first as
well. If neither work then a clucth/brake job is immanent.

I do not think the air-cooled Westfalia was up to towing.

You would be a amazed at what putting reinforced sidewall C tires will do
for handling on a Vanagon...this should be rectified by the dealer....DC

One minor issue, why do we always see people selling their vehicles early
on after rebuilds....this makes me wonder......DC
