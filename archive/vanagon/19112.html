Subject: JCW for pistons


To All:

In response to Steve Pribyl's question about buying jugs and cams from
J.C.Whitney, I recommend against it.  I've had three instances where a set of
 JCW-supplied pistons/cylinders contained one from a different weight group.
 This makes them almost impossible to balance since the VW spec per group is
something like 8 grams (!)  (You want them balanced to .1gm or better.)  T

he two examples of JCW-supplied cams I've seen were regrinds with a very
rough finish.  Since the cam/cam-follower interface is one of the fastest
wearing parts of a VW engine, you need the best compatability between cam and
cam-follower.  I've had good results by sticking to cams and followers from
the same manufacturer and source.  And the stock VW wiggle stick does just
fine for most applications.  

The only way a piston from one weight group could end up with another is for
someone to have swapped them.  I know suppliers here in southern California
have allowed certain customers to prowl their warehouse, breaking open sets
of jugs and checking them until they matched up a set within a gram or so;
saves having to send them to a balancer.  I don't know where/how JCW
gets/stores its sets of jugs but three unusable sets tells me something is
going on.

There is a reputable parts house in Georgia -- NOPI? -- that will sell you a
set of Mahle's for less than JCW.  I've not dealt with them but I know
several guys who do.  They probably advertise in DB&amp;HVW, or perhaps one of
the list subscribers can provide their address and phone.
