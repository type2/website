Subject: The Muir solenoid trick


Okay so I went out and bought a Bosch foglight relay as
someone suggested to wire into my starter.  I found that
the voltage getting to my solenoid from the ignition switch
was 8.9V, which presumably is low enough to not allow the
solenoid to kick in.  Also presumably it is possible to rig
up the relay so it will draw 12V direct from the battery
for the solenoid to use when the ignition switch provides
any voltage at all.

I futzed around with it for a while and finally got it
sort-of working.  When I started the bus to leave the shop,
the hot wire for the relay started smoking!  Obviously I
did something wrong.

The relay I got is a Bosch 4-prong foglight relay.  The
terminals are numbered 30, 85, 86, and 87.  I looked at the
little diagram on the side of the relay and couldn't figure
it out.  It's something like this:

       87      85
        /    -------
       |     |   / |
       o     |  o  |
       |     | /   |
      /      -------
       30      86

Okay so this isn't exactly right, but the relay is
duct-taped to my bus right now.  I think I had it wired like
this (which I know is wrong but it did get it to start
once):

30 - direct to battery (+)
85 - to ground
86 - to solenoid
87 - from ignition switch

Can anyone tell me how to figure out how to wire this?
