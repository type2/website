Subject: FS '79 VW Westfalia bus with blown engine, auto trans, Amarillo TX
Date: Fri, 14 Jul 1995 23:01:19

An ad came out in the local (Amarillo TX) paper today:

1979 VW camper, never been camped in much, 80,000 miles, needs motor work.
$1000.  Sean (806) 352-3531.

I called him and found out it had been towed to a local VW garage (Danny's
Volkstuff).  I looked it over and talked to the mechanics, who said that the
guy had been driving cross-country and it broke down about forty miles west of
town, just this side of Fanbelt, Texas.  About thirty miles down the road from
Blowout, TX.

Anyway the mechanics said that the engine is seized, won't even turn over.
And it's an automatic trans.  The exterior (beige) has some light rust but the
inside is really nice.  Deluxe Westy, with OEM stove, propane tank underneath
the sliding door, etc.  Checkerboard green upholstery in good shape.

The guy said make him an offer, he really needs to sell it.  It's got Utah
plates.  I would have offered him $500 but it's an automatic transmission
model.

Anyway, this may be just the bus for someone out there.
