Subject: Re: Yokohama Y370's $

&gt; Thanks to all who helped identify the Yokahama Y370 tires.  I finally found a
&gt; local dealer who can get them and knows what they are.  Unfortunately he
&gt; claims they will be U.S.$109.00 each.  That's US, not Cdn.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried Discount tires direct, Tire Rack, and Tele Tire.  None carry them.  A
&gt; couple of people on the list bought them for about 80.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have another source where I can get them at a better price?
&gt;  Maybe I need to go to Montreal and get them for $109 Canadian :-| ?
&gt; 
Probably doesn't help much, but I got mine for $108 CDN (actually 
paid $80 after trade in allowance of old tires). That's in Vancouver, 
BC though.

I just kept calling places until I found one that knew this tire and 
had them in stock. It helped that the owner of the shop drives a '67 
bus, and knows them well.... ;)
