&gt;Does anyone know the current  VW part No. for 1986-on Radiator
&gt;Thermo-switch? (ie., 1st stage in 89C-94C out 81C 2ed stage in 95C-100C out
&gt;87C). I plan to change over to the lower temp switch on my 1985 westy.

The current VAG # is 251-959-481K and according to the microfiche film:

1st Stage is 76C-87C  -  2nd Stage is 82C-93C

Note:  this switch was available under VAG # 251-959-481C or 481G which has
been superseded to the 481K.  Seems like every time I get a new film and/or
price list they super the number - guess they'll never make up their mind.

Unfortunately, 251-959-481C/G/K has only been available from the dealer -
price $37.75 (6/3/96 Price List)
