I am really interested in trying this process on my '85.  Any details--I
have never removed or looked inside an air flow meter before.  What does the
substrate resistor look like?  How is it cleaned?  Details, give me details!!

======================================================================

The AFM has a plastic lid that is secured by silicon. Long time ago
mine was popped of with compressed air by a mechanic. BTW I'm talking
about the gadget that sits between the air filter body and the throttle
body. Once the lid is removed there is easy acess to the parts in
question. The substrate must be ~3/4&quot;x2&quot;. I've just cleaned it with
alcohol.

BTW, I was running rich again this morning but my idle is fine. This is
so fun! Thanks for your input Joel, guess it could'nt hurt to replace
the temp sesor again.
