Barry asked me aboutthe Bi-Monthly publication I mentioned in my report. I'll place 
the response for the 'list' in case others may what to get in on this.

The publication is actually called &quot;Volkswagen World&quot;.

I found the following information inside:

&quot;Volkswagen World is an owner publication of Volkswagen U. S., Inc. Auburn Hills, 
Michigan. ... ` ...
A five year subscription ... isavailable for $20 by sending a request ... ` ..
Submissions for publication should be sent to ... ` ...:

	 Volkswagen World, P. O. Box 2012, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48303-2010

This issue I saw was dated &quot;Spring/Summer 1995&quot;.
There are sections for &quot;Calendar&quot; and &quot;VW Club Event Calender&quot;.
