&gt;In '66 and newer cars, smog inspections are required. So, you must obey
&gt;the law that says, You must have an engine THE SAME YEAR OR NEWER, as the
&gt;car. And, the engine must have all the smog stuff on it, as it did when
&gt;it came from the factory. 

Wait just a minute here... My engine's number has been filed off, but as far
as I can tell it's a '72 or '73 engine in a '75 bus.  It was smogged a year
ago with no comment...  maybe because the owner was a friend of mine??? Am I
facing hassles in the future on this?  Now I feel *urgent* about identifying
my engine year!!
