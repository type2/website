Subject:      83.5 Trans grinds into reverse?

Hello-

I installed a rebuilt 4-speed trans in my 83.5 Westy and it grinds into
reverse. It's not the worst grind I've ever heard, but it's disturbing.

If I start the bus with the clutch disengaged and put it into reverse there
is NO grind.
But if I let it idle with the clutch engaged then push down the clutch and
shift to reverse there is the grind. Also If I move in forward gear then stop
(completely that is) and shift to reverse it grinds. The forward gears all
work fine upshifting and downshifting.

Is this reverse grind normal? Or has anyone else suffered this problem and
has an idea what to blame it on?

I have a newly rebuilt engine so I didn't replace the pilot bearing when I
did the trans replacement. I assumed it was Ok. And I was also pretty broke
so I didn't replace the clutch or pressure plate. But like I said the forward
gears work fine.

Finally, I didn't adjust the clutch. But if it were a clutch adjustment
problem, wouldn't it grind into forward gears as well?

Any ideas?
TIA
Jeff
