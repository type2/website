&gt; &lt;&lt; ps, it has already rained 17inches this year here in Oly, WA.  but not all

&gt;
&gt; Clara,
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it WAS a rather looney trip, which is why I felt it justified the
&gt; telling.  And the account was factual.  But not everyone thought the same.
&gt;  Several people thought I would benefit from their expressions of disbelief,
&gt; one saying the thing was all bullshit since THEY had not experienced any
&gt; heavy rain that day. .
&gt;
&gt; It wasn't until after  writing the account of the Tehachapi Run that I
&gt; learned the Mt. Wilson observatory recorded thirteen inches of rainfall on
&gt; Tuesday, the day of the run.  Our annual average here at the shop is fifteen
&gt; inches.

We must remember that driving VW vans, with fast traffic on freeways and
all, is an adventure.  Through in unusual weather, which we CERTAINLY had
that day, and I, for one, really identified with your trip description.
I've done some crazy things with my VWs over time that you couldn't
possibly do with another car, even one of those yuppie-scum-truck CJ's.
Part of the bravery (stupidity?) comes from having rebuilt them so many
times that I'm not afraid of what might happen on most trips, I KNOW what
condition it's in and what I need to fix before I go away.  That and the
adventure aspect is what makes the trips such &quot;bonding&quot; experiences (gawd,
I used a PC term).

I'd love to hear similar stories of people's experiences!

Drive on!
