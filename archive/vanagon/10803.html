&gt; OK, I'm confused.  What is meant by final drive ratio?
&gt; I understood FD to be overall engine revolutions per tire rotation.  

Dave, 

I always thought &quot;final drive ratio&quot;  referred to the differential, 
as in front engine rear wheel drive power trains. Anyway, its just 
jargon and semanticks :-) In my Haynes manual they list the final 
drive ratios separate from the gear ratios. I was always more 
confused by &quot;lower&quot; and &quot;higher;&quot; A &quot;high&quot; gear (i.e. higher speed?) 
has a lower numerical ratio. Why don't you post an example showing 
your present overall gear ratios and your proposed gear ratios. As an 
engineer, you should know that an example is worth 1000 words.

I'd just worry about not having enough torque at highway speeds to 
pull into winds and up inclines without having to go to third 
frequently. If you had increased the power of your engine, this might 
not be a problem, but with the stock configuration, you might be in 
trouble. And, at the cost of a custom rebuild, this might be 
something you want to get right the first time.

Rich.
