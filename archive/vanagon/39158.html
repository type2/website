well, *I* DO believe in stereo. i'm old enough to remember HI-FI and Monaural
radios and record players and so forth, and let me tell you, Stereo is much
better. and blind people assume so, too. just as any of them. except the
deaf ones, of course, but not all deaf people are blind. at least, i don't
think so. anyway, stereo is great ... cause you have more gizmos and knobs
on the radio to fiddle with.

&gt;Obviously, not all Deadheads drive VW's.

yeah, but all the ones that don't are the ones with all the drugs!! why do
you think Chevy called it an &quot;Astro&quot; van??  ;)

&gt;Obviously, not all VW owners are Deadheads.

uhhhhhhhh ... you sure about that???

&gt;But, I think we can all agree that all VW owners are drug users.

oh, well, NOW you've done it!!!! MY MOTHER was a vw owner and she NEVER
used drugs!!!!! sold 'em, but never used 'em. :)

have a good weekend folks. :)  i'm gonna be trying to track down an old
B-17 and a B-24 that are supposed to be flying around my area.
