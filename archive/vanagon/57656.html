Subject: Re: Pesky Gas Exhaust Cover



&gt;&gt; What's a &quot;pesky overpriced plastic gas exhaust cover&quot;  ??

&gt;If you have access to the VW Camper Owner's Manual, you will find a
&gt;picture of this round plastic cover for the refrig gas exhaust. The 
&gt;purpose is to keep water, dirt and bugs out of that mechanism. Thus no 
&gt;spider webs, no water in the pilot to hamper lighting it, etc. It really 
&gt;works nicely as a protection device.
&gt;
&gt;These should have always been included with the camper. The manual acts as 
&gt;tho they always were-but I have NEVER bought one with the cover on it.
&gt;

The one-owner '89 Westy I have for sale (still available - any takers???) 
has a pesky overpriced plastic gas exhaust cover that indeed came with the 
van when delivered new.  This is the first time I actually saw one.
