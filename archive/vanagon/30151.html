&gt;Greetings Folks,
&gt;I've been corresponding with many of you from the sidelines of this group, 
&gt;but now I've decided to join for real.  Hello.  
&gt;
&gt;This has already been posted here, but I thought I would do it again 
&gt;personally.  I have lots of used parts for gas heaters.  Currenty, I do not 
&gt;have any complete bus units.  I try to keep the prices of my wares low.  
&gt;Also, although I'm occasionally stumped, I'm pretty good at trouble 
&gt;shooting the darn things.  Especially The Eberspachers.

Greetings back Thomas! 

I have a problem with my gas heater to do with the glow plug. This is a
'78 van with the gas heater under the floor (can't remember the model
number). I replaced the glow plug and everything worked well for 3
months. Then the glow plug wouldn't spark sufficiently to start the
heater. I measured the resistance through the center electrode on the
glow plug and it went from approx. 5 ohms new to 50Kohms after 3
months. Is this simply a case of poor quality glow plugs or could it be
caused by a system problem somehow? Has anyone had a similar
experience? BTW, the glow plug was an after market plug purchased from
a VW dealer. The official VW plug (BERU) was $70 and the after market
part was $40 and was indistinguishable from the official one. I bought
the after market plug :).
