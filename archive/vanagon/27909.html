Subject: FI pressure gauge


	Vahid,
	I'm in the Bay Area, and I bought a pressure gauge from A&amp;M Motor
Supply in Los Gatos for this very purpose when I owned a 914. I'd be
happy to loan it to you if you're around here, or even send it
to you if you send it back. Its been used once, by me, and it seems
like it ought to get used once in a while!
