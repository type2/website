 I have a '77 Camper with a unknown year possible new, not rebuilt 
 Mexican 1600 engine in it.
 
 I put a new Carb and Distributor on it and it seems to still just lack 
 any and all desire to go up any hill.
 
 I am sometimes reduced to 40 MPH on the shallowest of grades.
 
 I have two things.

I have to ask why you have a 1600 in a late bus?  It will not go up hill
fast.  Needs diffrent gearing to push the wieght of that beast.  Also, if the
performance was satisfactiry(you have a lot of patience), long drives at high
speeds will regularly melt the pistons and heads. Save your money and repalce
the 2.0L with the FI and all it's equipment including the EGR.
