&gt; 	handy to me when I get around to buying one.  This checklist
&gt; 	could include problem areas, how to identify whether or not to
&gt; 	buy the bus, what kinds of problems should you say no to,
&gt; 	things like that.  This could be a supplement to the Old Bus
&gt; 	Recovery Squad (local 201 ;) ) or could be for those folks who
&gt; 	don't live near any OBRS members.  I couldn't be of much help in
&gt; 	designing this list as I don't own a bus but I think it would be
&gt; 	very helpful.  This list could then be posted on the ftp site so
&gt; 	that those who need it can download it and print it out to take
&gt; 	with them.  Ideas?  Feedback?

This would probably work best as a comprehensive list with shorter lists 
embedded within it.  For example, curbside checks with hostile owner 
breathing down your neck, with mellow owner watching from the porch and 
within the confines of your garage.

To expand even more:
...
(C) Windshield cracked?
(M) Oil Leaks?  
    How many?  
    From where?
(G) Compression check (psi)
    #1    #2    #3    #4    #5    #6  
...

where &quot;C&quot;=creep or cursory, depending on whether the creep asks you 
what the &quot;C&quot; means, &quot;M&quot;=mellow or more comprehensive and &quot;G&quot;=garage or global
checks.  Of course you'd just try and get away with whatever checks you 
could run at the time, but such a checklist would be useful for newbies 
and experienced buyers as well.
