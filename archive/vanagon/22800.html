Well, not sure he's evil, or even his company. They've put out an
awful lot of popular, useful (note that I didn't say &quot;perfect&quot;)
software, and kept the company afloat well enough to back it up and
make more.

If he were to fold the company, close the doors, and throw 70,000
people out of work from the jobs he created for them, as well as
delivering a huge hit to every software distributor and store in
the free world and leave ALL his zillions of customers in the lurch...
that's what I would call evil. Or at least stupid.

In the '80s, before Microsoft became the huge, standard-setting group
they are now, it still grew and flourished (obviously). Why? Because
his software was GOOD-- better than any other, when combined with his
marketing and backup-- without which any company is doomed.

As for the platform he principally supported:  It's not Gates' fault
that IBM chose the wrong processor for the PC in 1983. Once IBM did,
it needed an OS for it, and guess who had one available, along with
a pretty good BASIC interpreter. And, as we know now, solid business
sense and the drive to keep it together in the face of competition,
government interference, and... yes, flames from users.

The guy's not perfect, and neither is his software. But until
something better comes along, I'll use his stuff to get the job done,
because it does that quite well.

As for the mail-header problem, Yes. A good example of less-than-
perfect software. John Schultz told me of a solution, which has worked
for me in Windows for Workgroups running MS Mail. I understand that it
hasn't worked for you, in your setup, tho (Windows NT?):

Add the following line to the [Options] section of MSMAIL.INI:

StripGatewayHeaders=3D0

MS Mail will then pass along all the message headers.

BTW, that's a zero at the end, not a letter O. Anyone have any clues
how to make this work with Windows NT?


Good luck, all...
