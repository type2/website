&gt; Hi Vanafriends!
&gt; Got my Carat back with a nice shiny bumper! It looks like new! and...
&gt;
&gt; Interesting adventure today ....
&gt;
&gt; On our way to Ontario airport to pick up mom, we hit a little plastic
&gt; thingy on the freeway. Ok, it shattered but we're ok.
&gt; Here we go around the interchange and whoah! Red light &amp; buzzer! oil
&gt; pressure is down! So I stopped immediatly &amp; parked the van on the
&gt; side. Im dreading the worst!

&gt; Has anyone had something odd like this happen?

Methinks going around that interchange produced enough prolonged
centrifugal force to shove your oil away from the pump sump!  Keep your
oil up to the full mark and slow down!
