Clark,

What ever you do don't bother trying to make one up yourself (or via a hydraulic
shop). I went that route and wasted about $65. The hose is a non-standard
internal diameter with pressure regulator tube inside. Without the regulator
your pump will whine loudly when you turn the wheels and will be quickly ruined.

Either gamble on one from a salvage yard or bite the bullet and get it from the
dealer. I seem to recall the hose *only* costing around $150-200USD.

&gt;a '90 Westy?  It's my current project. The dealer wants $250 for the part
&gt;alone
&gt;and already charged me $35 to 'fix' the problem by putting 2 hose clamps
&gt;around
&gt;the outer protective rubber sheath to 'stop' the leaking.  I hate giving him
&gt;business more than ever.
