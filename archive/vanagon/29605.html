Subject: Finding TDC



To All:

Top Dead Center is when a piston is at maximum height in the cylinder AND
both valves are closed.  This last does not apply to all engines but DOES
apply to air-cooled VW's.  On Volkswagens, Top Dead Center (TDC) of #1
cylinder is used for timing purposes.  The fan pulley is USUALLY marked with
a notch at TDC but this rule has been violated by some of VW's industrial-
and special purpose engines.  Since the fan pulley from one engine will fit
on another, you may run into 'alien' fan-pulleys from time to time.

When you have an alien pulley, one having no notches or such an array of
notches that it's impossible to determine which indicated Top Dead Center,
use the following procedure.

1.  Remove all of your spark plugs.

2.  Remove the valve cover from cylinders #1 &amp; #2.

3.  With the transmission in neutral, poke your finger into the #1 spark plug
hole while you crank the engine over using a 21mm wrench on the alt/gen
pulley nut.  When both valves are closed you will feel a rush of air past
your finger as the piston approaches TDC.

4.  Insert a long wire into the spark plug hole.  Check the pulley to see if
you are near an identifiable mark.  Keep an eye on it as you crank the engine
BACK AND FORTH.  Hold the wire loosely with your fingers, allowing the piston
to push it out of the hole.  If the piston is descending, crank the opposite
direction.

You are searching for the point of reversal, that moment when the piston
stops advancing.  When you have identified that point make a discrete mark on
your fan pulley.  Now search for the point where the piston starts
descending.  Perform the back &amp; forth cranking several times to insure you
have found the correct moment and make another discrete mark on the fan
pulley.

TDC is mid-way between the two lines you've just made.

To verify that you are at TDC, check your valve lash.  Both valves should be
loose, or about .006.

Your distributor should be pointing toward the vicinity of #1 plug contact.

Use all of this information to identify and confirm Top Dead Center.

When you are sure you've identified TDC, mark your pulley in an unambiguous
manner.  To set your static timing, measure 3/8&quot; along the rim of the pulley
in a clockwise direction and make another distinct mark.  Time you engine to
this mark, rotating the distributor as needed but not more than one eighth
turn.  If more rotation is needed your distributor driver-gear is probably
installed incorrectly.  You will need a driver gear puller to remove it.
 Rotate it one full tooth and reinstall.

This form of static timing will allow your engine to start and idle but you
MUST use a dynamic timing light to fine tune the adjustment.  See my several
posts on timing and timing lights.  Volkswagen abandoned the use of
static-only timing in 1962.  Pay no attention to the rantings of St. Muir in
this regard, VW is not out to 'trick' you into paying higher tune-up costs,
you really do need to use a stroboscopic timing light.

Improperly assembled engines often have the distributor driver-gear installed
one or more teeth out of position.  This can be corrected by pulling out the
gear (actually, it's a short shaft with the gear machined onto the bottom)
and reinstalling it correctly.  Be careful not to drop the thrust washers
that should be on the bottom of the gear shaft.

Proper alignment of the distributor driver gear as well as establishing
proper end-play on the driver gear are two of the basic steps in engine
assembly and are usually accomplished when the crankshaft is fitted to the
crankcase.  Non-professional mechanics often overlook these steps but they
are vital.  Improper endplay results in unstable ignition timing, while
improper driver-gear orientation can lead to heating problems on #3.

If you have a fan-pulley with confused markings you may wish to consider
replacing it with a full-size (not a 'power-pulley' after-market pulley
having clearer timing marks.  If you use a low-cost 'degree-wheel' type
pulley you'll find the marks are simply painted on.  To etch them in place,
soak that edge of the degree wheel in vinegar for about two hours.
 Neutralize with baking soda then give the etched aluminum a spary-coat of
clear lacquer.
