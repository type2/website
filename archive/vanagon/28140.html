Over the years, I've tried to just ignore the Bimbo aspect of VW's.  I 
finally had to subscribe to one the VW magazines because I got sick of 
the looks I got at the register paying for them.  Sometimes they would 
ask &quot;this isn't for you is it?&quot;  I felt like I was buying a Playboy or 
something. (Close enough, I guess).  The car show that I attend most 
often does not do the swimsuit thing.  I did win a raffle there once, 
and the prize ended up being a poster of a bikini clad young thing 
sprawled on the hood of a bug. (Now how many of you would let someone 
lay on the hood of your car even if they did look like that!)  Needless 
to say, I was a little disappointed by my &quot;prize&quot; so on the way out 
through the parking lot, I stuck it in the window of bug that had &quot;very 
young guy&quot; written all over it.

I think all in all in the VW culture, despite what the advertisers 
think, most guys are respectful of women in the hobby.  However, I've  
run across a few guys that automatically assume that my husband is the 
one into VW's just because he's a guy and I'm just going along with it. 
He could actually care less about VW's and cars in general.  He just 
humors me by going to swaps and shows with me.
