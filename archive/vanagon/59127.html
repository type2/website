Subject: sticker source

My sticker was on the garage wall at the old house and &quot;kinda-sorta&quot;
disappeared when we cleaned up for the real estate ring around the rosey.

Contact Rex Eastman at 
SunBugs (209) 742-6789
West coasters will know him as the &quot;Dude&quot; at all of the shows/swaps who
sells all of those great overalls and shop shirts. He has an apparent
endless supply of stickers.
Besides he's a nice guy. Mention that &quot;VanBondo&quot; sent you.
