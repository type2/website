why would jim want to 'wait for Joel's opinion'?? :) hell, you guys have
already told him what to look for, what to do, how to dress, and who's
coming to dinner!! :)

geez, i love this list!!

ok. calmly now. we have to set a goal for next year. in 1995, we have to
get ALLLLLL the buses in america on this list!!! Today, Internet! Tomorrow,
The World!!!

well,ok. maybe that's a bit ambitious. how bout: Today, Tuscaloosa! Tomorrow,
Amarillo?? ;)

there is a nagging thought in the back of my head about all this. do you guys
(and gals) realize that there is a Muir-like book in all this??  If everybody
'published' what the problem was, what they did to fix it, etc., and we put
all that stuff together ... well, not to blaspheme or anything, but Muir was
just one guy, with a few chickens and goats for help. lookit how many buses
we've got to work with. admittedly, we're gonna have some disagreement ...
but then, not Everybody agrees with what Muir or even Bentley says.

anyway, it's just a thought right now. lemme know what you think.

joel
