Subject: Does any body want a Sirocco?

All,

A guy here at Tandem, Austin, Tx, is wanting to sell 2 Sirocco's.  One
is a '77, and the other is a '78.  The 77 was originally bought as a
parts car for the '78.  He is willing to sell both.  Since this is the
vanagon list, and not the Sirocco list, I will leave the info at that.
If anyone is interested, contact me, and I will put you in touch with
the seller.

Cheers,

David
