Subject: Odometer/speedometer repair 

Greetings:                   

Have 85 GL Vanagon, 165000 miles.

Speedometer worked but with excessive vibration. Odometer and tripmeter both 
dead. Sent to Rick Borth - Overseas Speedometer - and now speedometer steady 
and odometer and tripmeter working fine. He also revised up the odometer 
reading to the value I asked for, so the odometer reading more closely 
matches the true mileage on the van. From the response, it looks like he got 
it, fixed it, and shipped it out it within a day.

Found him because his web page turned up in a net search.
