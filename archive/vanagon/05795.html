Subject: Engine Dilemma

OK,
	I have a dilemma here.  I am contemplating the rebuild of my bus's
motor, or more correctly the rebuild of an engine that will replace the one 
in my bus - I want to ditch the 40-horse.

	I have a good set of pistons and cylinders and 2 good heads.

	I am torn between buying a rebuilt short block.  There is a place
here in Sacramento that sells engines that are s'posed to be great.  My
surfing buddy has one, had it for about 8 years and umpteen zillion 
miles on it and is happy as a lamb.  Several other people swear by their
rep; the machine shop sez to just by one of their motors instead of 
them (the machine shop) doing the work; and a guy at another shop that
sells motors told me in confidence to buy this other one instead.  All
statements to the effect that I would trust the short block.   

	I will run me about $350. (plus core - and I have one.  BTW - they
don't take 40-horse as core!)_

	On the other hand, it would cost me $249 for a rebuild kit - crank,
rods, bearings, cam, P/C, etc.  And I'd have to get a case - I have a good
flywheel.

	Maybe I've answered my own question, but does this sound like I should
stuff my P/C + heads on the rebuild short block and go that route?

	Some background on my parts:  The P/C and heads were from my '67 bus,
that caught on fire.  The P/Cs were in it about 2 months before she bit
the big one, and visual inspection indicates that they are fine.  The heads
look good as well - the engine didn't really take too much heat, but the 
rest of the bus did (Sob! - thats another story if anyone wishes me to relate
it)

	Well, lets have some NetWisdom (TM)

Thanks
Thom
