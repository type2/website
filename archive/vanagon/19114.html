Subject: Re: Homemade head temp gauge?

&gt;&gt; Hey- the bus is running pretty well, 65 mph _at_ 11% throttle, 70 mph _at_ 17%
&gt;&gt; throttle, all at about 190 degrees oil temp pre cooler, and 135 degrees post
&gt;&gt; cooler.  The platinum plugs have made all the difference.  I actually revved
&gt;&gt; it to 5000 rpm for the first time.  It had plenty left and I think it'll go
&gt;&gt; well past 6000 if I hammered it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Isn't the oil temp &quot;supposed&quot; to be a wee bit higher?  You certainly
&gt;seem to have adequate cooling capacity.
&gt;Whats your thoughts on the oil temp business?
&gt;

Alistair,

Higher?  I'm pleased they are as low as they are, especially considering
it's a 2 liter upright.  The 190 figure is for driving mid-day at freeway
speeds.  The reason I get two readings is because I have two gauges, one is
for the dash gauge and is located in the case at the oil pressure regulator,
the other is for the FI computer and is located in the doghouse oil cooler a
la type three tap (after both coolers and should represent the actual
temperature before the bearings).  The difference is only from the stock
cooler and doesn't include the effect from the external cooler.  The actual
temperature coming into the external cooler is probably quite a bit higher.

Other thoughts?  A properly running engine should be able to hold average
oil temps under 180 F, unless driven hard and loaded in which case 210 is
where it should peak.  Most engines will probably peak around 230 though.
An engine with thermostat and flaps will reach 180 (which is the where the
thermostat opens) quickly and should be able to hold there.  With out
thermostat the engine should be quite a bit cooler, 140-160 F or such.  I
freak out at 250 F, getting nervous at 215 and working up sweat from there.

Yo, Veedubber, what do your race engines run at?  Does that Baja run end up
way high or what?

Eug,
