&gt;I am sorry to report that Marshall Gass which makes the 260-00 regulator
&gt;supplied on Vanagon Campers to control the propane system has discontinued
&gt;production as of two months ago. They have replaced this unit with the 290
&gt;but according to Chris Tourney at Marshall Brass (1-800-877-2495) the new
&gt;model 290 will not fit in place of the 260 because the black plastic shield
&gt;housing won't fit over the 290.
&gt;
&gt;Tourney said there is no black plastic sheld made for the 290. He also
&gt;stressed that if you install the 290 without any shield you will be violating
&gt;code, and worse than that, you will trash your regulator by allowing dirt to
&gt;foul it up. 
&gt;
etc

	I replaced my 260 (rectangular shaped reg) with, I think,
	a 290 (sort of snowman profile - big circle, little circle),
	a couple of months ago. The reg fits onto the tank okay,
	but is oriented so that the vent hole is angled up towards
	you, the installer. This is not a recommended attitude without
	a cover and the 260's plastic cover will not fit UNLESS you spend
	5 minutes whittlin' it with a sharp knife.

	Spent a lot of time on dusty logging roads, its still
	going strong.
