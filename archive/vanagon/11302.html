Subject: used parts

Does anyone have a good index for fair prices on used parts?
We are getting several used items and want to know if these are
reasonable prices:
speedo/odo - 50
fuel guage - 20
sliding door lock mechanism - 50
driver's side window regulator - 40

Does anyone have any idea if these are good prices or not?
