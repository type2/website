Subject: crashworthiness

   I was driving home on a very rainy night (streets were flooding and
everything) when some drunk bastard came flying out of a parking lot off of
a square curb.  I was going approx 45mph and could do little more than skid
into his driver side door, given the reaction time (not much) he gave me.
   Results:  My '77 bus was buckled pretty bad underneath the spare tire
(the tire was sorta pushed back near the bottom).  His car - well, the guy
managed to drive away (as I chased him, trying to get his liscense), but
I'm sure the body work needed to fix his '75 Nova was a few time more than
the car was worth.  When I got home, I was able to punch the dent out from
the inside using a 2X4 and a jack.  Yeah, I was pretty scared sitting that
close to the nose as I flew into the guy, but it turned out to be *not to
bad*
Although I don't think it looks all that hot, I recommend putting the spare
on the nose as an extra &quot;bumper&quot; (it also creates alot more trunk space).
   All in all, I think the bus is not an unsafe ride.
