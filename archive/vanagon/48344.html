Hmmn,

This is of course the van that Paul Wiess posted about 2 weeks back.
This would be very good for someone that needed it, I looked
at the said vanagon last weekend in fact and was going to buy
it and part it myself, but it was too far away from me (Baltimore
about 2.5 hours driving and some of us aren't running used car lots)
so I forgot about it, course the guy told me to beat Ron I only
had to do better than $900 so uh give us a break.  Also for anyone
interested the engine was in very good shape with factory head gasket
repair at 75k (100k on it now) and had 2 newly rebuilt axles.
Considering the engine etc probably will go for $1000 at least
let alone the tranny and other mechanicals this is a hell of a business.
Gee wish I could randomly buy buses and set them around the yard to
part them for ludicrous amounts.  I seem to only buy them set them
around the yard and look at them, must be something wrong with me.

Still a very, very nice clean interior, gorgeous seats and canvas
in fact, fridge spotless, all cabinets clean, oh and a/c in place
for anyone interested in the effort.  Shame the van took a severe
front hit.  It was so nice I had even priced a front end from local
van guy and was thinking about welding it on.
