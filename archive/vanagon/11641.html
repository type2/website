Subject: Re: redrock potluck

&gt;Anyone want to try for another of our famous potlucks at Redrock?  A few
&gt;of us burned out on 6 meals of fish chowder at Big Sur, so how about
&gt;something different this time?  Clam chowder?  Stew?  Pasta?  Tacos?
&gt;Hamburgers?  Chicken?
&gt;
&gt;Suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;/martha

Well, when I belonged to the department of ecology and evolutionary biology
at U.C. Irvine, they used to have a yearly party in the desert near Joshua
Tree which included &quot;MYSTERY MEAT&quot;.  Generally it was some form of fresh or
frozen road kill cooked for several days to remove any parasites and spiced
up beyond all recognition.  If you guessed what the mystery meat was, you
got to take home the leftovers.  Any takers?
