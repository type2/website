Tim,
My 87 Syncro has had a problem getting into 1ST since I bought it 4 years
ago.  I can get it into 1ST only when traveling VERY slowly or stopped.  I
can't seem to make a LOW to 1ST gear transition either.  When I use LOW, I
live with shifting from LOW to 2ND and skipping 1ST altogether.  I do however
need to push down on the stick to reach LOW or REVERSE.  I too, would love to
hear a solution for this problem.
