Subject: Re: Agony and Ecstacy

Change that title to &quot;Agony and Idiocy&quot;. While lying there contemplating the
starter, I realized there was a second blade connector sort of hidden on the
dark side of the solenoid. Moved the two wires on the little duplex connector
and Bingo we have ignition.

I let it rev for about 20 minutes as Wilson recommends and as he promised it
was a gawd awful racket. Then drove it about 15 miles during which time the
lifters quieted down and it was really right pleasant. It does idle rough as
a cobb and sort of surged against the brake when stopped. I'll take it to the
pros for timing etc shortly and trust that'll take care of the rough edges.

It may be wishful thinking but it seemed to cool better as well. I spent a
lot of time making sure all was clean especially the oil cooler. Granted it
was a short run tonight but the temp seemed to max at 210 and more
importantly showed some variation and cooling effect. Previously all heat
seemed to be cumulative; the temp just worked it's way up to 230 to 250 in a
straight line. I'll find out for sure when I put it on the road for a trip
this weekend. BTW, as an experiment of sorts, I am running straight 40 weight
oil which a vw shop recommended but I have never seen on a shelf til this
weekend at a NAPA store.
