Gregg is right about the volatility of gasoline. Explosion is not a major
concern if you're careful. But even more of a concern is weight. That damn
thing is heavy when it's half full. And if you've every tried to gently
move a large heavy item with a liquid sloshing around in it you quickly
find it has a mind of it's own.

&gt;Fuel isn't the real hazard.  The vapors are.  I would recommend emptying the
&gt;tank and letting any residual fuel inside evalorate over the period of a day.
&gt; Oh, yeah, don't smoke when you do this.  Otherwise you should be fine.
