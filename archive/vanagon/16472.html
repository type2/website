&gt;	Can you give me an idea of where this other hot springs is?  I
&gt;think it would be a great place to visit (anything to do with submerging
&gt;onesself in water is good when camping :-]).

I've been to Olympic hot springs, the springs that Rick mentions.  It's not
as great as Bagby outside of Portland (a truly great thermal springs), but
it's nice.

To get to Olympic, drive 8 miles west on 101 from Port Angeles.  Take Elwha
River Road 10 miles south on pavement past the Elwha ranger station to the
roadblock and parking area.

&gt;From there, walk 2.2 miles up the rapidly deteriorating road (and I *do*
mean *up*).  The trail comes to a campground, and then crosses Boulder
Creek.  The trail then heads back downstream on the other side, with soaking
pools scattered along the trail.  The largest I found (holding 10 people)
was towards the far end of the trail.  Most are small (but warm) mudholes.

People *do* skinnydip after hours.  I did.

The campground has running water and flush toilets.  Not bad for a hike-in
campground.

Oh, yes, and Solduc *is* a commercial resort.
