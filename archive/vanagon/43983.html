Subject: WANT 86MM piston (type4)

Hi All
I have a type 4 engine that lost a valve seat a couple of thousand miles
after a rebuild. The engine has a new (at time of rebuild) 86mm big bore
piston set and when the valve seat went bad it ruined one piston and
cylinder. Does anyone have one good piston and cylinder they would like to sell?
Thanks
Todd Francis
