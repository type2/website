Howdy,

	OK, so I've been lagging.  

	I still wanna do the FIsh Taco thang, an everyone sounded like
they wanted to do late July or Early August.

	The possible activities included Beer Drinking, Mountain Biking,
Old Sacramento, and a tour of Fitzpatrick's Body Shop.

	Since I still don't have a bike, I'm kinda SOL on the MTB gig :(

	So!  Lets have a final vote:  Who wantsa come, which weekend,
which day, and what activities. 

	I'll set to creating a map and putting it up on my FTP site.

	How bout if we try to finalise this in the next week?

Thom
