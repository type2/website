So William R. Kennedy, NJIT CIAT, 201-596-5648&quot;_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu says:
&gt; Dave Kautz points out correctly that your vacuum leak may be far from the
&gt; engine, but you can confirm or eliminate the brake system without digging
&gt; into the dash:  disconnect and plug the engine end of the vacuum line (white
&gt; plastic hose in extreme northwest corner of engine compartment).
&gt; B.

But what if your van is facing south? ;)  South is South?  I'm so confused...

;P
