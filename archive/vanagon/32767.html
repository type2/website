Subject: oil temps

Hi

long time no asking for advice and picking you brain. If you have
forgotten I own an 82 Vanagon and I put a GEX rebuild in it about 6
months ago. My question to you is I just got a VDO oil
temp gage and I would like to see where the temp should be. When I am
driving on flat highway its reads between 180-210, but when I start to
climb mountains, I live in colorado, it gets up to 250. Is that too high?
It has never run higher than 250. I just put Castrol synthetic 5w 50 in
and it stills runs the same temps. I am kind of worried because it is
winter and cold and it is running these temps.

Thanks 

Jared
