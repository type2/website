Ping? Ping? Pong?  what do i look like, a Sonar??? :)
i don't know of any brake notices offhand ... remember that a lot of those
bulletins got added to that last issue of the bentley manual (july 91) so
if it says yadda-yadda-yadda in there, that's likely it.

&gt;'So the little red hen said &quot;I'll just have to fix those brakes myself!'

and nobody wanted to eat them! :)
