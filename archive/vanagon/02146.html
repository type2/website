Some mechanics I have talked to say that Arizona or New Mexico are the 
preferred choices for buying any used vehicle because you are guaranteed 
a body in great shape  AND these states don't have stringent smog laws
and the equipment associate with
that particular demand..... correct me if I'm off track.....DcOn Thu, 21 Jul

&gt; &gt; I think California would be your best bet for getting a hold of a good
&gt; &gt; running camper and the further Northeast you go, the more money could be
&gt; &gt; had for selling it back because of the no-rust factor.  The hardest part 
&gt; &gt; would be getting it smogged initially.  Ideally you would want to get one 
&gt; &gt; from someone that has already had it recently smogged so you don't have to 
&gt; &gt; go through that much hassle.  
&gt; 
&gt; In California it is now the law that anyone selling a used vehicle *must*
&gt; provide a smog certificate with it at the time of sale, so if you buy one
&gt; here, insist that the seller provide it.  Many people here still don't know
&gt; about this.
