&gt; &gt;Iwas telling a friend, and he said, &quot;oh, it's probably the electronic

&gt; 
&gt; amazing what you can forget. :) my old 71 bus used to loosen the cut-off
&gt; switch (really a little solenoid) and i'd have to tighten it about once or
&gt; twice a year (they didn't have Lock-Tite back in the stone-ages). so check
&gt; that as well ... it should NOT wiggle back and forth when you check it with
&gt; your fingers.

I'm glad this solution has finally surfaced.  I poked around on my 71 
this weekend and found this wire to be loose, along with the wire that 
runs over to the other side of the carb.  Both of these hooked to the 
coil with (you guessed it) another loose wire.  So, I am off to Radio 
Shack for one of those little boxes of connectors and some wire.  
Hopefully this was my problem all along.  I don't know whether to 
laugh or cry.
