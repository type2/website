&gt; 
&gt; &gt;You have discovered the difference in the heater boxes. On the bug
&gt; &gt;the cables connect down below. The bus connections are on top. There
&gt; &gt;is a kit that you can buy to make the modification.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Do you know a supplier of this kit?
&gt;

At least five of the local parts stores here in San Diego stock
the kit.
