Subject: Type III.. er I mean, Type 2 Trucks

OOps! Just shows how you can get mixed up after being out of VWs for a
while.  I poster this originally asking for type 3 trucks, but I really
meant type 2 trucks.
Sorry 'bout that.
-----REVISED Message: -------------
I'm starting to look for a vehicle to use both as a vehicle to carry things
as well as to satisfy my urge to get back into air-cooled VWs (last one was
a Ghia in '79.

What's the availability of the type 2 pickup trucks?  What are they going
for?  Is there a list for them anywhere?
