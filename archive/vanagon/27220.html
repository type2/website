Subject: Camping/Staying near Coral Gables, Miami, Florida?
Date: Mon, 23 Oct 95 1:00:03 EDT

My partner and I will be going to Florida next month. Some of the
time we'll be sailing a small Hobie catamaran, and beach camping.
We have done this this before in the Everglades and Biscayne NP
(see pictures on my WWW-pages). This time we also planned to sail from
the John Pennencamp (sp?) park on key Largo, and then Thousand islands
on the west coast. (Any other suggestions welcome)

Now to the main question: The other purpose of the trip is to attend
a conference (IE^3 CVS, 19-21 Nov) in Coral Gables, Miami. The question 
is where to stay during the conference. We need to accommodate:

	2 people
	1 vw bus (camperized)
	1 trailer with an 18 feet Hobie cat on it

To not break the budget we need to do this for max $50/day.
Can somebody with some local knowledge either:

	A campground nearby.

	A motel/hotel where I can keep an eye on the parked 
	trailer and boat.

	(Or just some place to park overnite without being hassled
	by either police or criminals, low cost alternative :-)

In the AAA guide there were only two campgrounds listed under the
Miami area (both KOA's). They appeared to be quite a way from
Coral Gables though. How is the Coral Gables area? Can one find
outdoor parking there? (trailer + boat won't fit in a typical
parking garage) Is it safe at nite? 

Thanks,
Martin
