&gt; &gt;What's the deal on Binz Crew Cab's as opposed to others? Was this a
&gt; &gt;retrofit in the US? I've heard of these before, but I've never understood
&gt; &gt;that there were so many. I always assumed that Binz was a dealership or
&gt; &gt;something. Inquiring minds want to know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Binz was a coach company that took VW single cabs and made them into 
&gt; crewcabs.  They were made before VW produced crewcabs themselves (VW 
&gt; started making them in 1959).  Some identifying marks are a suicide 
&gt; rear passenger door with wide popout window, a short indentation on 
&gt; the side gates (they were cut down and re-welded single cab gates), 
&gt; and the forward truck bed seam on the driver side.

   the binz also came with a none suicide door too.  seen a couple of
them.  the side cut down gates carried through till mid 60 when VW made
there own finally for the crew cab.  just a little more info.

Take care and God Bless
