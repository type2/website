I think that's an interesting question. The death rate of type 2s is
certainly a factor. But we could also look at the &quot;birthrate&quot;, i.e. see
how many were sold in North America each year (it's in the FAQs) and look
at the correlation. I say &quot;North America,&quot; because that's where most
people from this list are from. Maybe Joel could compile a N.Amer. only
stat. table for that purpose?
