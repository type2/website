Subject: Re: '72 engine


&gt;&gt; and would it be possible to kludge all the camper bits to fit  my '74? 
&gt;
&gt;Definately!  
&gt;
Well, remember that the Vanagon is 5-6 inches wider inside than the older 
bus, it also has a rear deck height about 6&quot; lower. It would be a major 
kludge, since you'd have to narrow the cabinets/bed, and cut off the rear 
section of the bed base, loosing your hinge mechanism. I don't know about 
lengthwise mods, but you will need a full (vanagon size) side behind the 
driver. I've gone the other way, '72 westy into '85 vanagon, lots of spare 
room, and the '72 westy guts are more modular units.
        The comment about the heads is right I believe, but why not use the 
whole damned thing, as long as the flywheel and engine mounts work out. 1000 
mile rebuild would be just broken in, and probably less work adapting 2000 
motor intact than making a hybrid.
        $900???   hell I'll take it. Thats a good deal. Where are you 
anyhow? I'd be willing to chip in for the pop-top/upper bunks/front 
seats/windows and similiar vanagon bits you can't use. I live next to Maine! 
in the mysterious east of Canada.
