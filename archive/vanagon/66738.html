I've been a 'list lurker' for about 6 months or so and have seen many =
testimonials on the value of using the 'official VW' or German oil =
filters. BUT I'd been successfully using ANYTHING that was listed as a =
reasonable replacement for my Vanagons UNTIL today.

I decided to have my local VW dealer change my oil and filter since they =
had a price that was lower than the drive through outlets.

On the way home, which included a stretch of 60 mph beltway, I noticed =
that my temp gauge was well below where it would have been yesterday!!  =
The only thing that had changed was the oil and filter.  The oil was =
about the same as before (20W50 Valvoline) but the filter was one of the =
'approved ones'.  My temp gauge set to the right of the LED - not =
something that I would have expected before.  And I don't think that =
I've ever had temp problems.

So I assume that the difference is the filter - what gives?  What's in =
that thing?  I'm beginning to BELIEVE.  I asked the service rep about it =
just out of curiosity while the work was being done and he talked about =
multiple bypass systems etc..  So do tell - What's so great about the =
official filter or was I imagining things?
