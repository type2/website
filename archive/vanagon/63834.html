Does anyone know anything about putting this in the AC of system of an
old 79 bus?  Mine's got a the A/C system sitting there and it doesn't
work.  I'm contemplating seeing if I can get it going but I wouldn't be
willing to put maybe more than $100 or max $200 into it.  Anyone know if
this is a pipe dream?

&gt;      This appeared on the list a few weeks ago, but I haven't heard
&gt; much 
&gt;      more about it.  Penzoil is touting a new FR-12 refrigerant which
&gt; seems 
&gt;      to be a better solution for owners of R-12 systems.  Check out
&gt; the web 
&gt;      page at:
&gt;      
&gt;         http://www.frigc_dot_com/
&gt;      
&gt;      for more details.
&gt;      
&gt;      Dunno why we haven't heard more about this - the little Oliver
&gt; Stone 
&gt;      on my shoulder (otherwise known as &quot;Bad Goofy&quot; - obscure NYPD
&gt; BLue nee 
&gt;      Disney subreference) tells me that since a conversion to FR-12 is
&gt; 
&gt;      billed as less labor- and parts-intensive than a conversion to
&gt; R-132, 
&gt;      mechanics aren't as interested (less $).
&gt;      
&gt;      Anyway, FWIW.  I seem to recall that one or two listmembers have 
&gt;      reported converting to FR-12 with excellent results.
&gt;      
&gt;      Barring any future unfavorable information, I'm gonna do it too
&gt; when 
&gt;      the time comes.
