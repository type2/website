Subject: Thanks and Hello to GNATT folks

A special hello and thank you to all the list members that I met while on
GNATT, especially Alistair, Steve, and Martha for letting me stay at their
houses, Pete for sticking with us for so long, Bradley for the IRC lessons,
Toby for the Vancouver tour, Joel for developing pictures fast and mailing
them out, Sami for use of his computer, etc., etc., etc.  I really enjoyed
myself and I learned A TON about VWs.  I find myself seeking out VW campers
on the road and I say to myself &quot;ah, Westy&quot; or &quot;oh, a split&quot;.  I'll admit I
was a little overwhelmed at first, but now I know why you're so crazy about
these vehicles.  Anyone who wants to camp in the &quot;wild&quot; part of my yard in
SE Washington State (Richland) is welcome to do so, ideally I would get
more notice than we gave poor Steve (about 30 minutes).  I'll even let you
have a magnesium fire (with tuna and clam chowder cans of course) at the
far end of the lot.  :-)

Shelley
