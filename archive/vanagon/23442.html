Subject: inflatable fiberglass winches (early fffff)

Imagine a big bold ad in your fav vw magazine:

&gt;New Fiberglass Winches for all OffRoad UpHill Vanagon Studs. 
Provides that Silly Macho GeeGaw Look!

&lt;insert cartoon of Sami pointing to the front of his Vanagon 
as he &quot;Simply Amazed!&quot; &gt;

Be the first on your block (and tackle) to own one!

Your friends will think that you have stretched 
your ingenuity to the snapping point. Packs away tightly.

*(SOTO Approved)

Place your order and wait and wait and wait and.....



*Sorry, I couldn't resist
