Subject:      Re: water pump replacement

i said:
&gt;&gt;&gt;ALL water-cooled buses have had to have the water pump replaced...
he said:
&gt;How do we determine when to replace the water pump regardless the coolant
&gt;color?  Can someone also post the proper steps of replacing it?
&gt;This is for an '83 H2O boxer.

i think that bentley has the procedure, but i'll have to check when i get
home. on three water-cooled vanagons (1986,1988,and 1991), the water-pumps
all started showing symptoms by
(1) coolant level dropping over time.
(2) deposits of white-blue chaulky-looking stuff (looked kinda like bird-doo)
    on the oil filter (and in that area).

i'll look and see if i can find a tech bulletin on water-pumps when i get home.
