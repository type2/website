I am having weird problems with a 2.1
 The unexplained cutting out,etc...(eps. after a long drive)

I was thinking of getting that updated wiring harness for the
 air flow box. part number 025 906 302

Does any one have experience with this part...
 I saw the article in the FAQ, but i wanted to see if any one had 
personal experience with this upgrade...

Thanks
patrick
