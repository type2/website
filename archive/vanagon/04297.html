Subject: Interior Camper Lights

Regarding the post on interior lights:

Every Vanagon owner with a camper knows that the light near the closet is
great, but that additional interior lights are needed over the stove (for
cooking), over the sliding door, and in the far rear parallel to the right
rear window for use with the luggage area.

I ordered a pile of extra lights from Delta Six and installed these in these
locations. I also installed one up in the camper roof. All the lights are
factory original so they look great.

I also made it so I could turn any of them on or off from the drivers seat
and by reaching up over the sliding door while standing outside the vehicle.

Isn't the Delta Six dude scheduled to fall over dead from old age or
retirement soon?  Buy your lights now!
