&gt; 
&gt; With all the interesting information concerning oils I didn't notice anything
&gt; about cooling abilities. I had the sense from previous interactions that many
&gt; refrained from synthetic oils not because they weren't good but because they
&gt; lacked the ability to remove heat like the others.
&gt;

That's because oil is not used to cool, it is used to lubricate.  Oil or
water is used to cool the engine.  The thin-ness of synthetic oil which
can leak through seals is what scares me away.  Don't know about others
other than cost.
