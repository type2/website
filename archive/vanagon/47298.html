Hey, this may not be such a long shot, we trade our cabin in Tahoe for 
other locales, and have gotten some interesting trades from it!  
Sometimes it includes a car.

&gt; Long shot: Anyone interested in swapping VW busses, 2 weeks in my
&gt; bus (82 VW Westfalia camper) in North East US (I'm in Upstate NY) for 2 weeks
&gt; in your bus in Queensland? 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Martin
