     I've decided to get a Diesel Vanagon or Westy. I'd like to get one
     with the engine dead or near death, and re-power to a Rabbit gas
     engine. Once the summer is over, I plan on selling my trusty '88 GL.
     Keeping it for now, since it's the only car we have with functioning
     A/C.

     So I start reading the paper, and lo and behold, in yesterday's
     Washington Post:
     1980 Vanagon. Camper model. Has stove, fridge sink.Needs some work.
     $800.00 cash or best offer.

     I called the lady selling it at 8:30 AM. Already sold :(

     While it wasn't a diesel, it had potential...

     Oh, well.
     Just had to share.
