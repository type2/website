Subject: busses slandered by MSF

          a friend and co-worker who just completed her Motorcycle
          Safety Foundation classes in order to get her M/C license
          told me that they saw a movie depicting &quot;quick stops in
          blind corners&quot; and the example they used was an old vw bus,
          broken down on a mountain road, being pushed by a bunch of
          hippie types, thus creating a hazard for the biker.  i
          represent that implication.  good timing since we're all
          heading for the blue ridge this weekend.     ray
