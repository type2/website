&gt; Hello I am a former list member with an urgent question:
&gt; I have an 84 1.9L Vanagon taht I am replacing the head seals on.
&gt; My question is this.. Do the head cap nuts have a washer to be
&gt; installed?  When I took them apart They certainly did, however, 
&gt; there is no indication in Bently that there are washers!
&gt; In fact they say to put the sealant on the bottom surface of
&gt; the cap nut... no mention of washers at all.  I f there were
&gt; washers wouldn't they suggest coating both sides of the
&gt; washer?  I know that this engine had fingers in it before
&gt; so could it be possible that this was some post d factory
&gt; invention by a shade treer.  

As far as I know, there are no washers for the head cap nuts.  I did a 
head gasket job a few months ago, however, and can say that on mine, the 
cap nuts would not stay at the required torque--they'd back off a little 
bit when I reached the right torque.  So, this makes me think it needs 
something.  I must admit also that I did'nt buy new cap nuts, which I 
would recommend.  

Has anyone else experienced the cap nuts not staying at torque?  If so, 
what do you suggest?
 
&gt; Question: Is the fat black ring gasket in the head gasket repair
&gt; kits for the water pump?

Yep, there should be a gasket for the water pump.
