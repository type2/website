I have heard that switching to synthetic oil might unclog certain leaks
that may have been stopped up with gunk, so it may appear to cause leaks
where there were none before.  I am also a member of the camp that is
afraid to switch for this reason.  I don't want my heater to smell any
oilier than it already does.  :)

&gt; advantages of synthetic? rank ordered:
&gt; 
&gt; better flow charcateristics especially at startup;
&gt; better heat transfer;

Didn't someone on this list recently post saying that synthetics are
_less_ good at heat transfer?
