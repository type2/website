Subject: Thanks....I needed that....


I'm glad to see that the sense of humor, camaraderie, irreverance,
AND irrelevance is alive and well here on Vanagon! With the
change in the format requiring responses sent to the original
poster rather than the list causing more work (yep...I'm lazy)...
and the 
        complaints by some that this list isn't too &quot;technical&quot;
enough.....yep...go and start your own technical list!....

I'm glad that the &quot;flavor&quot; of this list that most of us long-timers
and short-timers as well have grown to love and appreciate is still
here....what am I speaking about ... why of course today's little
&quot;banter&quot; arising from the original &quot;Another Cool Vanagon Seen&quot;
post...

Thanks folks...Steve, Joel, etc...you've made my day! I'm glad
we are discussing serious topics like bags over our heads,
flaming magnesium, exploding tuna cans along with the obligitory
serious stuff!


Is it Friday yet? Is martha still in flannel? Will I ever shut up?


BTW, Gerry..or Joel....who is winning this year's posting race???


Ok....Ok...only kidding...we all know what happened last time
the stats were released!!   ;-)
