Subject: Re: Too much heat?....

&gt;When does your air-cooled bus have too much heat.  When the windshield(s)
&gt;crack.  Yep, last week I let the ol' bus warm up with the gas heater
&gt;blasting away only to find the passenger side windshield with a series 
&gt;of large cracks with their origins by the defroster vent.  This weekend
&gt;I managed to do the same to the other side.  I gotta remember to turn that
&gt;thermostat down abit and never, NEVER, position the flap to defroster mode.
&gt;Anyone have some windshield glass for a '65 deluxe?
&gt;

Sorry, christian, no glass here...just thought I'd chime in to tell everyone
that my 71 bus sometimes gets &quot;too hot&quot; even in the cold Connecticut winter
nights with my BN4 gas heater.  I haven't cracked (as in broken) any windows
yet, but I do occasionally open a vent or roll down the window.  My heater
is not ducted to the main heat tube that defrosts the front windshield,
though.  I use the stock heat exchanger configuration to provide the
windshield defrost and the gas heater to heat the interior in general.
Christian, how is your gas heater configured--in line with the main heat
tube?  Have you eliminated the stock heat exchangers?  I'd be curious to
know how you have it set up.

I really like telling people my bus is too hot--after driving around for
five years without a gas heater I feel I paid my dues and have earned the
right to gloat!!
