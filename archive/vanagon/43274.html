Subject: RE: VR6 Vanagon

Steve Rosen offers test drives in his Subaru-engined Vgon.  Sign me up,
Steve, and you can drive my (properly German) six-cylinder conversion at
the same time.  I'm sure others on the list will be interested in our
mutual impressions.  Let me know when you've tightened the last few
bolts.  Hope it goes together smoothly.
