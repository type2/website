Subject: RE: Dielectric grease


&gt;Then an older guy comes out from the back.  &quot;Whaddya
&gt;lookin' for? Point lube?  Hmm, check in the blah-blah catalog.&quot; So Billy
&gt;has a look in the blah-blah catalog, goes in the back; comes up with a
&gt;little box.  &quot;This what you want?&quot;  I open it up:  ahhh, point lube!!!

Years ago, I asked for Point Lube, ad was given a tiny tube of stuff.
Put it on the point-rider cam of a distributor in a warmed-up '70 Beetle,
and it promptly melted like butter and ran down into the distributor.
I don't think the real stuff is supposed to do that... Save your receipt!

Hey, is there any reason that a tiny dab of plain old grease grease
wouldn't work? Or wheel bearing grease, or whatever? If you keep it
off the point contacts themselves, it shouldn't matter even if it's
conductive (which I don't know if it is or not)!


&gt;If anybody wants the CarQuest part number, I can post.

Please do!
