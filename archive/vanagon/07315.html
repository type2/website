&gt; I see that the Bosch is mentioned alot and was wondering what its smog
&gt; story is for CA.

Illegal for any VW in which it was not original equipment.  Most VW's that
I know of have at least one diaphragm on the distributor (mine has two)
and they are required to pass emissions.  The 009 is all mechanical advance
and has no diaphragms.
