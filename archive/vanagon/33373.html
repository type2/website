Subject: Re:still life with gerbil/tailpipe

The '66 should have a bent/curly tailpipe which dips under the bumper. if your
bumper is '66 it should not matter that the engine is later...I think. Some
bodger fitted me with a straight / bend tailpipe which is standard for early
Bay windows (I think you guys call them bubble windows?). My family nearly
choked to death.....well felt real pukey, till we sussed it was  this. A
simple replacement cured it...The pipe is stock, and is difficult to source -
NOS are about and every so often SSVC gets a few direct from Wolfsberg. We can
get reasonable repros though (but they rust out quick). I know people who got
round it by actually heating and reshaping a bay window tailpipe.. Dave.
