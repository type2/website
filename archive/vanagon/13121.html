&gt;&gt; I have come to these conclusions:
&gt;&gt; 1) Get a different carb, and use the 009.
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; 2) If you have a 34 PICT-3, you must use a vacum retard distributor.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Well, just for balance, here's a totally different opinion/experience:
&gt;
&gt;I run the 34 PICT-3 and the .009 dist. on both my '71's.  They both idle
&gt;well, but have the same off-idle flat spots.  After experiencing this
&gt;setup (especially on the Bug), I wouldn't go back to the vacuum setup.
&gt;When I lived in CA and smog cert. time came around, I'd slap the vacuum
&gt;advance dist. in, reset the timing, then go have it smogged.  When I
&gt;got home, out came the vacuum dist. again.
&gt;
&gt;Now, when I first got the .009, it took me quite a while to find the right
&gt;combination of timing and carb settings to get things to run right.
&gt;What worked best for me was a timing setting of 7.5 BTDC, and a larger
&gt;main jet.  Since I moved to the Arizona high country, I have replaced
&gt;the larger jet with the stock one, but I still use the .009.  I get
&gt;28-29mpg (on my Bug) on the hiway.
&gt;
&gt;As far as the off-idle flat spot, well, I've just learned to live with it.
&gt;Fancy footplay with the accelerator has become second nature to me.
&gt;The gain in performance more than offsets the annoyance factor.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know why there is such a wide range of experience with the .009
&gt;dist.

Would you mind telling me where your idle screws (2) are set?
