Subject:  Re: Baltimore tips


&gt; My wife got us a free night in a hotel in Baltimore!  Now what can we
&gt; do with a 7 month old and a 5 year old besides the wonderous aquarium
&gt; and the zoo?  

	Camden Yards for a ball game. The Babe Ruth Museum.  The B&amp;O
Railroad Museum.  The Maryland Science Center. Baltimore Museum of Industry.
American Visionary Art Museum.  All within walking distance of downtown.

&gt; How is the parking downtown?  Should we bring the
&gt; Passat instead of the Westy for getting into parking decks ( the
&gt; westy is way too tall for most of them )?  

	Most garages are less than 6'8&quot; I think.  (I needed 6'8&quot; for the 93
EV {78&quot; + 2&quot; for safety} and now the EV-C claims 80&quot; but I'm skeptical until I 
measure it myself)  There's at least one (like under the Gallery I think) that 
is 6'10&quot; or 7'2&quot; maybe.  I'd ask the hotel.

&gt; Any and all suggestions
&gt; are welcome.

	Go see a ball game.  The O's are hot.  I could give you a schedule.

Enjoy!
