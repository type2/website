Subject: Re: four-position wiper stalk, 78 bus -Reply


&gt;If the old buses have this four-position stalk (I'm not sure if my '78 does
&gt;or not, I've never tried it) it would be cool if intermittent wipers could 
be
&gt;retro-fitted to old buses.  I remember someone mentioning something
&gt;about a wiper relay?  How would one go about finding out if one of the
&gt;newer relays would fit an older bus?  Intermittent wipers would be nice


I'm not too familiar with the OEM-type relays. But JC Whitney has several
add-on interval-wiper kits in their catalog. This might be the perfect
application...??? Even if it turns out there is no electrical contact in
the fourth position of your lever (don't ask me), the fourth position
could be utilized by a strategically-positioned microswitch.
