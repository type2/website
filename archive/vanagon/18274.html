&gt;I have VW Transporter FWD 2500 c.c. long-wheel-base (you call it
&gt; Eurovan,right?),8-seat ,the suspension kit from ABT is installed,
&gt;the wheel is MB 500SL's 8*16 with 225/55 ZR yoko AVS.
	&gt;The problem are
	&gt;1. the car is very underpowered ,especially when fully loaded with
	&gt;8 passengers ,are there any way to improve ?
	&gt;2. ride is the big problem too,very very stiff ride (too stiff for
&gt;	passenger car) even with stock suspension (I think 8*16 is a cause)

With regards to #1 above, I think the EV is underpowered with just one in it 
 ;-)
However, you could try any or all of the following:
1) got a catalytic converter?  take it out...you did say you were in a poor
country, didn't you?  :-O
2) since the 2.5 liter gas engine seems to be a mutant derivative of an Audi
truck engine, perhaps
    you can shoehorn some MB turbodiesel truck engine into your Transporter. 
Remember,
    you want big horsepower, and big torque, OK?
3) what happened to the MB 500 SL that you got the wheels from?...  God, I
hope you didn't
    put the stock Transporter wheels/tires on it!!!   :-P   Anyway, I bet you
wouldn't have any
    power problems if you stuck the MB's engine into your Transporter!   ;-)
4) sell your Transporter immediately to PJ in Ireland (hey, are you still
alive over there?),
    and contact William Kennedy about setting yourself up with a Vanagon
packed with a Porsche
    air-cooled flat six, preferably a Syncro.

With regards to problem #2 above, uhh, yeah, I'd say those 16x8 wheels w/ 55
profile tires
just *might* be contributing to the problem.  You could always throw on some
15x7, or 14x6
steel wheels with 70 or 75 profile tires...that'd probably help...
The other thing you could do is bribe some highway construction crew to pave
the road to your
house...   :-)
