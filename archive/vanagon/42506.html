&gt; Currently there are four 88-90 Westalia Automatics for sale in the bay

My wife's automatic 88 isn't particularly slow compared to a manual trans.  I
think there's really not much of a difference.

&gt;but I was wanting feedback on longivity and reliability.  

We have about 110,000 miles with no auto trans problems at all.
