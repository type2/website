Subject: Re: Re[2]: The water heater project

Lee asks, about the water heater,
 
&gt;     I am very interested in performance though and your friends figures 
&gt;     seem very promising - how hot is really hot ?? I figure you need about
&gt;     70 degrees water temperature to really feel the heat.
&gt;     
It's too hot to hold your hands under (very scientific)

It is nothing fancy, just a water tank from a caravan shop, fitted under the 
rear seat and one of those foot pump things for lifting the water up to the 
sink. He has one pump for hot and one for cold so you sort of jog on the 
spot to get a sink full of warm water :-) The water circulates round the 
heat exchanger by itself.

&gt;     I wonder if the Wizard ones had any sort of Heatsink inside them for 
&gt;     better conduction ?? like the air ones. And do you fit two ?
&gt;     

He just has one. It takes a while to heat a full tank from cold, but he just 
fills it up before a camping trip and by the time he gets there its scalding 
hot.
