Subject: RE: Help! Engine Dies While Crusing


&gt;returned to the van, she had a very hard time starting. She would
&gt;start and then stall out. Wel after finally starting it up, we
&gt;pulled out on the highway, and the engine just died. Not stalled
&gt;out. Nope it just stopped, like someone pulled the plug. This
&gt;happened at least six times during the ten minute trip to our
&gt;camping spot.

Could also be a blocked fuel line or fuel filter.
