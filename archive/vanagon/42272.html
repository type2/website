Subject: THANKS to the list and the archive! (Whew!)

I thought I'd put that message somewhere, but DURN I couldn't find it in
any of my folders or disks or mailclient &quot;IN&quot;-box or ANYWHERE - so I jumped
on Netscape, clicked over to Alta Vista, typed in &quot;vanagon list archive&quot; -
two jumps later, found &quot;VW Parts Dealer, Don't Skip This...&quot; about Walser
VW in Phoenix.

Thank you thank you thank you thank you!
