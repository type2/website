Subject: Re: Hydraulic Valve Lifters

Dennis and others:

I have another question on the valve adjustment.  The Bentley says 
turn the lash screw 2 turns after  it contacts the stem.  Some the 
the valves mush down and don't lift off the seat (unless you screw in 
way past 2 turns) but others start lifting the valve immediately.  

How are the turns be counted?  During the mushy part if it is mushy 
or should it be run down to the hard part where the valve is forced 
open?

&gt; When adjusting valves properly, they will lift off thier seat.  You must wait
&gt; 1/2 hour or so before starting engine to let lifters bleed down. 

so does &quot;properly&quot; mean lift all the valve off their seat 2 turns?

thanks!
