&gt; transmit signal strength is up to 100%!  Before it was at 75%.  Also,
&gt; the fuse didn't just blow, the entire strip of metal was missing!  I
&gt; figure the fuse must have had a bad contact.  Turns out Scott Sminkey

These old VW fuses are notorious for corosion when they get this old,
I'll bet 10 to 1 this was the problem, its a good idea in our beasts to
pull all the fuses, use an eraser to clean up the fuse block contacts,
squirt on some electrical cleaner / anti-ox stuff, then clean all the
fuse ends on some fine grit (400-600) paper, coat ends with dielectric
grease or just a little petroleum jelly (just a bit mind you) then
reinstall, all sorts of electrrical gremlins will dissapear. BTW
Automotion and others sell gold plated jobs for Porsche and other fine
European makes using these fuses if your really feeling rich.  Of course
if you're feeling super brave you might make it an electrical service
weekend and pull every crimp connector and solder it onto the wire as
well, gauranteed nearly as good as a new wiring harness if you're in the
mood for some selfabuse might do the intrument panel one day, the engine
compartment the next, lights on another, break it up a little.
