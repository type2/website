Subject:        2nd Battery

I am having some charging problems and think it may be the marine battery
(the charging (idiot) light stays on while I'm driving, the battery
indicator light is yellow, oh, and the warranty just expired:)

I have an isolator in the circuit, and am wondering how I can safely
disconnect the 2nd battery to see if the idiot light turns off?
