Subject: more split $$$ questions.

Hi all,

With the recent questions about splittie bus prices I figured I'd throw
this at you guys and see if you can help me out...

Here's what I'm looking at : 1963, the owner says its a deluxe but it
has no sunroof or windows on the roof. It does have all the side windows
including corners. Not a walk thru so I'm guessing it was a nine
passenger???
The rear seats are gone, but the interior panels are all there. The
exterior is rust FREE but the rear wheelwells have been cut out, It also
has the deluxe trim on it.
No motor, no rear bumper.
He's at $1000 and I'm pretty sure he's not gonna move.
This bus is located in rusty Pa. so getting a rust free body without
traveling a zillion miles is a big plus BUT what about those wheelwells??

Tell me whatcha think.
TIA
