&gt;&gt; but they have no hands! yahahahahahahahaa.
&gt;I think Joel has gone off the deep end this last week.  Waddaya think folks?
&gt;Or maybe he's got a big 4th of July weekend planned?  Definately been at the
&gt;keyboard way too long.  Well Joel, I'm sure there's some explanation.  If it's
&gt;drugs, well... Can I have some too?  ;)

it's those 'voices'!!! they keep singing these stupid songs in my head!!!
and, in the background, are these little gnomes from the Schwartzwald,
singing &quot;Oh Fow Vey, Oh-Oh&quot; (like the witch's henchmen in Wizard of Oz).
i need a Bus-Fix bad!!! ;)

is it Friday yet??
