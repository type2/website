Subject:      vanagon list - locations of y'all :)

well ... somebody happened to mention that they wondered just where everybody
is. so my fertile little brain modified one of those dippy little programs
to produce this:

-AUS    2          FL      1          MI      1          RI      1
-CAN    5          GA      1          MN      2          TN      1
-UK     2          IA      3          MO      1          TX      4
AL      1          IN      1          NC      3          VA      1
AZ      2          KY      1          NY      6          WA      2
CA     14          LA      1          OH      4          WI      4
CO      1          MA      5          OR      2
DC      1          MD      1          PA      4
Unknown      41
Total        78

this means that there are 41 of you that i can't figure out what your location
is from your email address. anybody that wants to tell me, i'll be glad to
add your 'loc' field in my file.  looks like them danged californians out-
number us all!

this is location of buses, by the way, not people. so if you have two buses
in texas, you show up twice in here.
