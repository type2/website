Subject: Seat Swap (was: WTB: 73 Bus seats with headrest (Connectiuct  area))


&gt;&gt;Do Vanagon seats have the same rail spacing as breadloaf vans?


The '80 V6anagon has rails that you slide the seat sideways onto, and
then insert small bolts to hold the seat in place. I'd imagine that
this is what all '80 Vanagons have for the center seat-- am I right?

But my '71 bus, and the '69 bus before it, had no rails at all for the
center seat. They had small metal plates welded to the floor in strategic
spots, with an oblong hole where you could fit a T-shaped bolt and a
cast hook-shaped piece to hold the seat down

Are we talking the same seats here? I'm sure the center seat is removed
and replaced far more often than, say, the fronts. In fact, I've *never*
had occasion to remove a front seat in a bus, except for the '71
non-walk-thru, which had the spare tire under the front seat. No rails
there, either-- just a couple of heavy steel guides with slots that the
seat fit down into.

Asid from that rather unique bus, I haven't a clue what the front seats
of a 'loaf sit on. My apologies if I'm talking about the wrong seats here.
When the upholstery of my '69 bus's front seats got too shredded, I
simply applied more duct tape.   :^)

But my V6anagon center-seat mount, isn't even close to the center seat
mount of every upright-engine baywindow I've ever seen. No way can they
swap, unless you want to do some cutting and welding.
