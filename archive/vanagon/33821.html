Subject: removing front hubs

&gt;I'm having problems with the front
&gt;ones - how do you get the cover/seal thing in the centre of the hub off? (not
&gt;the chrome hub-cap, the thing inside in the middle - sorry, I don't know what
&gt;it's called). Muir says use screwdriver and hammer, but mine isn't budging. It
&gt;doesn't even look like a separate thing! Am I trying to do something stupid?

        I had mine off a couple of weeks ago. The trick for me was to get
the front end up on axles stands and with a small hammer ( I used one with
a hard plastic head) started whacking away, while rotating the wheel. This
distributed the whacks evenly, and the hub just slowly eased out. I worked
about 10 minutes with the hammer, not so hard as to have my arm aching or
anything. This dented up the cap, but only slightly.
        Remember to remove the speedometer cable clipped into the centre of
the hub, on the left side. Good luck.
