Subject: Re: Freeze plug leaking coolant, what to do?


&gt;If I drain the system, how do I (nondestructively) get the
&gt;block heater out? And what should I do to make it seal
&gt;better when I put it back in.
This is probably not the answer you're looking for so try the external
sealing methods first. To remove the heater, first loosen the screw in the
center of the heater. Loosen it as far as you can, then tap on the heater a
little bit to loosen it up from the block, it's usually only just stuck a
little bit. Once you get it moving you have to get something in behind it to
pry it out. This is why. When the heater is installed the screw is connected
to a piece that spreads out past the hole in the block to hold it in, (like
a dry wall anchor). This piece does not return to it's original smaller size
so you have to pry out the heater which causes the retainer to bend back
into place. Have never replaced a used heater, it wasn't worth the cost of a
new one. Don't forget, if you do try it, to replace the seal on the screw also.
