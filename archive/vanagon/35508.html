 Wishing y'all a happy long weekend! Now, to the point.
I'm going through the procedure of acquiring a 1956 Kombi, 36HP engine. Will
I have extreme difficulties getting parts for this vehicle? The idea is to
restore it to original mint condition. Of the mail order companies, which
ones are, to the majority of the list, the best ones not only about quality
of parts but quality of service?

Hooray and congratulations!

yes, you will have difficulty getting some of the parts.  However, there is
an extensive world wide word of mouth vintage VW parts network.    Try your
local VW shows and shmooze at the flea market.  The mail order companies are
good for rubber and some other parts.  Yet others (for example, shift linkage
under the bus for a 58) will have to be found off a parts bus somewhere.   I
am not sure if you can still get early e-brake cables new any more.    Many
bits are not reproduced,  and the hunt is part of the adventure of restoring
an early bus to stock, a difficult but honorable task.    

I am very happy with mail ordering from Wolfsberg West, they know what they
are talking about, they use VW nine digit part number for  easy cross
reference with actual parts and with my parts book, and they send stuff off
promptly.  

I havent ordered from RMMW or BFY, but they are out there.

I have some extra wigits off a 59 that im scrapping out (its leaving Monday),
 and junkyard raids.

Keep the list updated.   :)
