Subject: Syncro &amp; 4WD Insignia

Syncronauts,

Has anyone else with a dark colored Syncro checked into
getting the &quot;Syncro&quot; and/or &quot;4WD&quot; vinyl insignia from VW ?

What I've found out is they only come in two variations -  Titan
Silver, dark and Titan Silver, bright.  The VW dealer and I haven't
figured out what the difference is between these two because they
are both the same silver color  which is so close to Wolfram Grey
that it hardly stands out on my '87 Syncro.  They cost around $22
each from VW and I need two &quot;4WD&quot; and one &quot;Syncro&quot;.

Since I can't get insignia that stands out against my '87 Wolfram
grey Syncro I'm getting a price from a second cousin of mine to
make these insignia.  We're scanning the insignia into his Gerber
System and we will be able to reproduce them in any color and
any scale.  The insignia that's being scanned are ones that I bought
from VW.

I'll take orders from anyone else that needs or wants a different
scale of these insignia.  Just let me know what color and whether
you want the standard size or a scaled size and I let you know how
much they cost.  I'm having mine cut into a bright silver metalic 3M
eight year outdoor vinyl.

BTW - Does anybody have a Wolfram Grey Syncro that has the
syncro and 4wd insignia ?  If so what color are they ?
