So Jim Macklow says:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I had some fun hunting
&gt; &gt; down a length of wood that would hold the accelerator at 2000
&gt; &gt; RPM when pressed against the seat just right.
&gt; 
&gt; I've found it easier to place a folded piece of paper at the idle 
&gt; speed adjustment screw, and vary the number of folds to get the desired 
&gt; rpm.
