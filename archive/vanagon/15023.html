Entirely possible.  

&gt; 
&gt;   Another possibility: I've been reading &quot;How to Rebuild your Air-cooled VW
&gt;   Engine&quot; since my engine is in pieces in the garage and there is some 
&gt;   discussion of potential parts mis-matches between cams &lt; 3 rivet and 
&gt;   4 rivet&gt;, oil pumps &lt;different gear widths&gt; and cases &lt;different sizes of
&gt;   oil galleries and studs  Would you like me to xerox that section
&gt;   send it to you so you can check it against the parts that you have &lt;had?&gt;?

This is the book I used (a very good one, IMHO).  I'm sure I had all the
right components.  I did not do some of the measurements outlined in that
book, however (like checking for correct line bore, and checking for crank
runout).  In retrospect, I should have obtained the tools to do so, or sent
the parts out and had it done.  I think if I'd of stayed true to the book,
I might still be waiting for parts and/or machining, but it wouldn't have
conked out after I got it back together!
