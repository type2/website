Subject: LIST T-SHIRT INTEREST????


 Howdy. It seems that the spring season has rolled around, and I am being
 reminded that I said I would do another batch of nifty vanagon_at_lenti t-shirts.
 This is then an interest call. If I can get 35 or so people to agree to buy
 shirts, then I will go ahead and print a batch. I will see how the response
is,
 and make an announcement this Friday. Shirts would be ordered then in a couple
 weeks. I have pictures on my webpage (address below at the end of my .sig),
 both a close-up scan, courtesy of David Schwarze, as well as a couple shots of
 me modeling the shirts. Anyway, price would be $16.00, which would include
 shipping and handling. (Non-USA orders would be an additional $5.00 for extra
 postage)
 So, then, if you are interested in me doing another batch of shirts, please
let
 me know soon. The colors would be spring-ish, more like the original shirt
than
 the fall colors...
