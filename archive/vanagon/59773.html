Subject: Re: scary cruise control

Are there feasible options re: a clutch deactivation.



An aftermarket cruise unit I had, kinda generic, it was Dana I believe had
a method of connected the brake mounted vacuum dump and electric kill
switch to the clutch pedal.

        I guess the automatic version had the supplied length of bead
chain, the kinda stuff used on pull light switches, that was terminated to
the area on the firewall- bulkhead for the politcally correct. For clutches
they had a longer chain and instead of terminating the chain on the
firewall, a u shaped pully kinda affair allowed the chain to be routed
though it and back up to the clutch pedal arm, where it was terminated.
Then if either pedal was touched the tension on the chain was slacked and
viola! the circuit was killed and the vacuum was dumped.

 If I were to do this, a bike shop would be my first stop.  They sell gear
changing cable and pullies. So if you can and have a brake mounted vacuum
dump and kill switch that uses a bead chain or cable terminated to the fire
wall, this would work.  I know, cause I had to use this cable &amp; pully
modification on my beloved 240Z to hook up the throttle. It still works
today after 18 years of flawless no maintence service.
