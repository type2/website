Subject:       Re: a reason NOT to use the parking brake

it could be glazed drums.  that offen happens with newer shoes or 
even older ones that get overheated.  as long as the shoes still have 
plenty of meat on them you should be o.k. if you just have the drums 
lightly resurfaced and sand the glaze of the shoes.  if you do that 
DON'T BREATH THE DUST!   there is also the possibility that the drums 
are warped.  when you nail the brakes does one or the other lock up 
prematurely?  or, when you jack it up does one or the other 
experience a tight spot when it is rotated?  these would be good 
indications of a warped drum.  resurfacing will tell you for sure.  
    don't worry though, others have experienced much worse.  over the 
summer i met a woman who had moved from texas to michigan.  she had 
some moving company tow her car behind the trailer and you guessed 
it;  they left the parking brake on.  they ended up paying for new 
everything in the rear braking system.   i suppose that could be a 
good one for the idiot factor string.
