Hi Nirvanagonians,

OK, so I bought this all-wheel drive Aerostar last week to pull my boat,
and now my wife says SELL THE VANAGON.  I've had her for 24 years and Felix
(the van) for only 13.  So, what can I do?  When it came down to her or the
dog a few years ago, I let the dog go, but only had it for 3 years.  I'm
stalling.  Still want to qualify for one of Martha's summertime outings, so
am in no hurry to sell.  You probably remember this as the saga of
Westfalia Blues posted last year, with 7 engines replaced over 80K miles.
Well, the reblt GEX 2.0L engine is at 2500 miles and running strong, still
with an optional 3 year warranty.  This bus is pristine in and out.  Yellow
exterior.  Automatic tranny.  Seats and floor have been covered since new.
Stove never lighted.  Always cooked outside.  No kids, so interior is like
new.  Exterior has one minor sideswipe on right side.  Top excellent.  Only
problem is no air conditioning compressor, and an  occasional start up
hesitation that's annoying but clears up after a few seconds.  Felix was
purchased in San Diego and maintained in SF bay area for the last 10 years.
If you are cheap like me, you wanna sell high and buy low.  So, if you know
someone interested in this bus, make me a 'decent' offer.  Will take the
best offer when I decide to sell, but don't hold yer breath.  Selling my 88
RX7, too (or maybe instead). :)
