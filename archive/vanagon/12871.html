You can replace the antenna without removing the dash, well I did anyway
with my '72, antenna on passenger side.
BTW, after I broke that antenna the third time, I bought a replacement
that fits over the stub of the old one. Much easier and looks fine, plus
you can take it off with a fine screwdriver in a jiffy.
