&gt; &gt; I will fill it up with diesel fuel by pouring it through the intake
&gt; &gt; manifold, then boil it over a Coleman stove for a few hours, sloshing all
&gt; &gt; the while. While singing hymns. =:o
&gt; 
&gt; Don't forget, diesel is fairly safe at normal temps.  But the flash point 
&gt; is about 140F.  So if you heat it up it will be almost as volitile as 
&gt; gas, and a little spark could ignite it.

It was a joke, Brad. Thanks for your concern, though...
