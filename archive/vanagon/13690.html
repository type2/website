Subject:       Wasserboxer torque spec update

Import Service, Feb 91, Vol 4, No 2

&quot;The cylinder head nut torque specification listed in our November 
1990 &quot;Wasserboxer&quot; article [the one on the net] has been updated.  VW 
recently increased the recommended head nut tightening torque for all 
water cooled Vanagon engines to 50 Nm, up from the original 
specification of 35 Nm.

The tightening procedure described in the article must still be 
followed, substituting 50 Nm for the final torque.  We apologize for 
any problems this specification change may have caused.&quot;
