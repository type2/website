Subject: Ooh, Ooh, manual!

Gidday all!

'Tis been a while since I've spewed ASCII at ye all...  
Depression caused by having my '74 in storage these last
two years (sniff) has stilled my fingers of late.  However,
I monitor the list like a trouper.

Some of you have turned to talk of swapping manuals and I'm
interested in getting an owner's manual for my '74 type II
and am willing to trade the '79 type II manual I have.  
I don't care if it's a xeroxed copy or not.  As a matter
of fact; are there any '79 owners out there that need a 
copy of that years owner's manual?  --Ralf
