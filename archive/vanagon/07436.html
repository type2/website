&gt; Derek Drew reports:

&gt; In the latest issue of Hot VWs a writer enquires about high performance water
&gt; cooled motor parts and the editors respond that there isn't much but they
&gt; also say this: 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Fortunately, quite a few of the internal components are interchangeable
&gt; between the waterboxer and the Type 1 engine including cam, crankshaft,
&gt; distributor, oil pump and rocker arms.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This sentence sounds like an outrageous assertion--hardly believeable. 
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody else ever even *considered* swapping beetle motor parts into
&gt; their 83 and up Vanagon engine????
&gt; 
&gt; Right. I thought not. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you have given this matter any thought or study and you are reading this
&gt; post then out with it!  Share what you know.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; The editors also add that they had an article dealing with modifications to
&gt; the &quot;Wasservoxer&quot; engine for performance in the August 85 issue. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody got this article or know what it says. It might be a good idea to
&gt; have it posted to the net.

 There are some resemblances between the wasserboxer and the upright fan engine
 the rocker cover gaskets are the same, for instance, but I believe that the 
 crankshafts are way different. Maybe somebody can look in Bentley to check
 but I think I remember the wasserboxer crank as being a mixture of type I and
 IV journal sizes and I think the wasserboxer flywheel goes on with bolts like
 a Type IV instead of the infamous gland nut.
