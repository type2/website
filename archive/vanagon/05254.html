&gt; &gt;Someone kindly (?) did that to my '67 before I got it, so it is now a
&gt; &gt;walk through of sorts... I know those were stopped in I think '77, since
&gt; &gt;my '78 didn't have them. 
&gt; 
&gt; Do you know if they were replaced with some other kind of reinforcement,
&gt; like maybe a bar welded at a lower, unobstrusive spot?
I don't believe there is any other reinforcement in the walk-throughs,
since it would have to be at floor level, where I assume there is
significant bracing anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The main purpose fir them, I think, is so in a
&gt; &gt;rear-end collision, the seat won't snap backwards.
&gt;  
&gt; Do you really think that was a concern back in the 50s and 60s? Especially
&gt; if what you report about the Beetle is true.
&gt; 
I don't remember the statistics exactly, but I did enjoy what (and sorry
I forgot who it was) posted about those single-vehicle accidents :)
