Subject: RE: Why didn't that VW use his signal?!


&gt;My turn signals suddenly decided not to function this weekend.  When
&gt;activated the indicator on the dash just glows and doesn't blink.
&gt;Bad relay?  Bad switch? The signals don't work up front or back.
&gt;All bulbs are OK.  What are the most common culprits for misbehaving
&gt;signals?  Please help.  I have now resorted to using my hand out the
&gt;window.

In a Ford with a separate plug-in flasher unit, it's a bad flasher that
normally makes this happen. In your bus, probably something similar, BUT...

I had a '66 bus whose front signals didn't work, while the rears did.
Traced the trouble to a mysterious black (well, gray) box with a VW logo
and a lot of dust on it, up in front under the dash, just to the left of
the steering column. Couldn't for the life of me figure out what was in
there, so in true hacker fashion, simply ran new wires from the rear
turn-signal-filaments up to the front signals. Lived happily ever after--
not only did the turn signals work properly, but when you stepped on the
brake, both front turn signals lit up as well as the brake lights in back!

The wonders of modern technology...

Does your '59 bus have such a &quot;mystery box&quot; up front, with wires running
to it from every corner of the car? Is the flasher unit inside, or is
it a little round can hanging next to it? Or a square can. If it's separate
from the mystery box, replace it, and I think your troubles will be over.
If it's inside the mystery box, tho, better head for a junkyard. Or call
VW and bring your wallet-- you didn't REALLY need that tax refund, did you?
