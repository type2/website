Subject: Transmission Be Gone?

Driving home last Fri.  I think I my transmission bit the dust.  Going into
fourth, the van just chugged like it had no power and the whole under-
carrige seemed to shake.  So I put it in third and then tried fourth again.
same thing.  1st, 2nd, &amp; 3rd worked fine.  Drove it to the mechanic on 
Sat., test drove it, and said that either the trans was completely gone or that
it was some peice that aligns the gears when shifting has cracked.  He's
going to open it up today.  Any thoughts or condolences out there?  Advice?
How about cost experiences on something like this?  Thanks.
 
-Scott.
