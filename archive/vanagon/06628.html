Subject: Re: Fish Chowder Potluck (Martha and Pfeiffer people)


	I presume that Fish Chowder consists of Fish, Potatoes, Peas,
Carrots and little white Onions, with milk or cream and black pepper.
Gee, Sole or Cod or that kind of fish would be a good start, yes? 
	Recipies, Martha?

	There's a SUPER bakery just off highway 1, at Capitola,
one exit south of 41st Avenue. Get off the freeway, go right, to
Capitola, and about half a mile along there's a major intersection,
with a little shopping center on the left side and a green grocery on
the right. The bakery is on the left. I plan to stop there to pick up
some bread on the way south.

	Bill
