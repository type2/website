Awright, you guys...

Among your 'rich-running' troubles you wouldn't perchance include cold-start
problems?  I posted here a month or so ago concerning my '85 Vanagon's 
difficulties in getting started after sitting a while.  I got several helpful
responses, all of which undoubtedly improved the overall health of my bus,
but none of which eradicated the root of the problem.  

Here are the symptoms:

- Whenever I get in the bus to go to work or come home (I'm a 9-to-5-er,
+/- an hour), I turn the key and the engine starts, runs for a second, and 
dies.  If I try again immediately then the starter just spins the engine but
it doesn't even try to start.  Waiting for about a minute or so allows me to 
repeat the cycle (the engine tries to start).  IF however I immediately
and aggressively rev the engine to around 3k rpm or so when I first try to
start it, then I can usually keep it going on the first try.  The problem 
appears to be worse when the outside temperature is lower (i.e. my bus is
much more reliable these days :{) ).  I always smell gasoline when I am 
backing out of the driveway.  In addition, my gas mileage has been in the 
15-17 mpg range for largely freeway driving (20 miles each way) and I know it's
been better.

Here's what I've done :

I replaced the rotor, cap, wires, and plugs with the good ol' Bosch stuff. 
I noticed that the resistance in the wire from the coil to the distributor 
was way high by comparison to Bentley, plus the cap and rotor looked pretty 
nasty inside so I replaced the works. Do I need a coil and that Hall sensor 
gadget too?  How often do those things go out?

I also replaced the coolant temp sensor (#2, near the thermostat) and bled the
cooling system (yecch!).

Here are some other points o' info :

- The thermostat was recently replaced by some corner-garage apes (the story 
would take too long to type in...) and now the engine takes forever to 
reach operating temperature  - I think they put in the wrong freakin' thermostat
or it's stuck open all the time.

- My bus has the notorious head-gasket leak problem, but it's a *very* slow
leak and recently the spots under the back end have been smaller than they 
were a couple months ago.   The level in the overflow tank is where it belongs.

I was intrigued to read the following:

&gt;I'm the one that complained about poor idle on my '85 van. It's always
&gt;fun to go down various paths to attempt a fix:) I thought my idle
&gt;stabilizer had gone out and was in the process of trying to prove it
&gt;when I discovered the van was runing very rich. Hmmm... this was always
&gt;a symptom of a dirty resistor substrate in the air flow meter.

Yeah, I'm not so sure about the 'fun' part, but I hadn't checked out the 
air flow meter to extensively yet.  So I put my meter on it per Bentley
and the limits of resistance were ok.  But that wasn't enough, so I took 
the damn thing apart.  It looks like the resistor substrate is indeed quite
worn (oh by the way my bus has 83k mi on it) but I'm not so sure it's worn
enough to make any difference in operation.  In any case I haven't been
able to budge the screws that hold down the damn PC board so I can't see if
adjusting it helps at all.  

I've gone on long enough.  Sorry. Thanks for listening and I am anticipating
another flood of wisdom and insight from this ever so caring and wise 
community.

Peace.
