Subject: Re: politically correct and you children's silly songs


&gt;Name another pop tune from the '70s that was written about Don McLean
&gt;singing &quot;American Pie&quot;, and its affect on the writer...
&gt;

Killing Me Softly. I've forgotten the singer. Always liked the song though.
If you're a Don McLean Fan, check out his double Albumn: Solo.

Was I supposed to pose a new question? I didn't get the whole answer here,
so I'll leave it for the person with the complete answer.
