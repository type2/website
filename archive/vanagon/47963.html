&lt;&lt; the wheel bolts had been 
 &gt;replaced with *COMPRESSED AIR* and could I move them.....could I 
 &gt;sh*tters like!  Ended up with the old Benbo photo tripod over the star 
 &gt;wrench, bent the tripod and FINALLY got the bolts to crack.. &gt;&gt;

I bought a breaker bar at Camping World in Orlando (there's several locations
across the country) which is about  16&quot; long and telescopes out to double the
length.  Came with a socket end ratcheting attachment and other goodies and
does the job.  Its nicely chromed, has a rubber grip and in the collapsed
position 
doubles as a billie club and rides between the seats or in the door pocket.
As i recall it was about $20.
