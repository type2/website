Subject: Headlights

After suffering the notoriously bad headlights to point of hating to drive at
night. I decided to check the voltage reaching the lights. It was 9.9v or
10.3v with the engine running. I ran a length of 12 gauge wire from the
battery to two heavy duty relays now I am getting 13.4v with the engine
running. What a difference, it is almost like a real car. I am thinking of
installing some 100w H-3 bulbs in the high beams. BTW does anyone have a
drivers side high beam lens that they would like to part with?
