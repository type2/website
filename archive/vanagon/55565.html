Subject: Re: oil change help urgent

&gt;Crawled under the 81 to do my first oil change as a newbie and the oil
&gt;drain plug is stripped. Also the parts in the manual look different than
&gt;what's there it shows a bolt requiring an allen wrench and mine is just a
&gt;regular nut.
&gt;
&gt;Everything is spread out on my driveway and I can't get the damn oil drain
&gt;plug out!
&gt;
&gt;Should I just take it to a oil changer type place?  I really want to do
&gt;this myself!

It was probably an oil changer type place that screwed it up in the first 
place.  Try  a pair of vice grips and some Liquid Wrench.
