&gt;&gt;My experience with not reving up under load, was a clogged fuel filter,

&gt;&gt;fuel filter, possibly the small brass screw that is loosened when you
&gt;&gt;drain water out the bottom of the fuel filter?  or the water drain?

&gt;My guess is that you are probably having a slightly hard time starting in
&gt;the morning. The bubbles in the line do indicate air getting in. The
&gt;symptom of only seeing them when the engine is shut off tells me that the
&gt;shaft seal on the pump is leaking. It's an easy repair, if you have the
&gt;tools to re time it, and if you can find a seal. There is a diesel pump
&gt;rebuilding shop a couple hundred mile from me. I just call them up and tell
&gt;them the type of pump I'm working on and they UPS the seal to me. Used to
&gt;cost about five bucks plus shipping. You have to be real careful removing
&gt;the old seal. The shaft is hard and a little bit forgiving of being
&gt;scratched but you don't want to take any chances. HTH

        Well, at this point I have replaced the filter and the fuel line.
The fuel line seemed to help a little, but I am still not there yet,

        What seal are we talking about? Are you talking about the seal on
the shaft that is between the injection lines?  Can this be done without
removing the pump (as I do not have the tool for retiming the pump)?

        The clutch on the '79 has started to slip (bad) so I need to get
this van running (I don't want to have two of them taken apart at any one
time, the neighbors (and my wife) will get very irate) Thank you for your help.
