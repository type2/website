&gt;Subject: HEAVY  Duty Shocks
&gt;
&gt;I've watched and waited but lately, no one has brought up shocks--So here
&gt;goes.       My creame puff 84 Westy needs a more stable ride, she needs to

As an 84 is not a syncro it cannot use syncro shocks, particularly not the
front shocks.

&gt;toughen up a bit!        I'm interested in the Readers experience on specific
&gt;shocks.  I would like some very HD, non air shocks.  I am open to suggestions
&gt;and have a frugal budget.
&gt;
&gt;********************
&gt;I am somewhat remiss in updating the list so here goes.
&gt;
&gt;An update to the Bigger/Better shocks for the Syncro crowd.  Some traffic did
&gt;cross the list a couple of weeks ago, heres a synopsis of that info and where
&gt;I am with the search.
&gt;
&gt;Some good info has been gathered, and I remain commited to finding out WHO the
&gt;OEM manufacturer of the &quot;N&quot; suffix part is, hopefully so that I can get it
&gt;easier/less expensive from the manufacturer, rather than order from VW Germany
&gt;or from Peter Seikel.  (Although Peter does come very highly recommended)
&gt;
&gt;The shock for the rear is the same as for the standarsd van.

This is not true.

The shock for
&gt;the front of a SYNCRO has a spring perch on it, and is stiffer than stock non
&gt;Syncro's.  I do know that Bilstein does not make for the SYNCRO front, KONI
&gt;does not build a shock for the SYNCRO front, and Sachs/Boge builds only the
&gt;&quot;C&quot; suffix which is the softest available from VW.  The &quot;C&quot; suffix is
&gt;available from VW America, and better prices can be found with Ron Salmon at
&gt;the Bus Depot.   &lt;www.busdepot_dot_com&gt;

Boge says they make a heavy duty version of the C shock which is widely
available in Europe. Don't know if this is the N suffix or the M? suffix.

&gt;1. Basically, of the three factory front shocks for Vanagon Syncro, all are
&gt;identical in dimensions and are progressively stiffer from suffix C to
&gt;suffix M to suffix N.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;front shock:   251 413 031 C   regular
&gt;                          251 413 031 M        14'' HD package &quot;Schlechtwegepaket&quot;
&gt;                          251 413 031 N        16''
&gt;
&gt;rear shock:    251 513 031 D   regular
&gt;                        251 513 031 M  14'' HD package
&gt;                        251 513 031 N  16''
&gt;
&gt;2. Peter Seikel is happy to sell these and says the N style was the factory
&gt;option for the years 90 and 91 for 16&quot; Transporters. Seikel says the springs
&gt;he sells are much stiffer than the factory springs and are also progressive
&gt;rate. He said the factory springs are 75 kios per 1cm spring rate whereas
&gt;his springs are 140 kilos per 1 cm. He says his heavy duty springs can fit
&gt;even a factory original C suffix shock absorber, so everthing fits together
&gt;in any combination, with no compatibility problems.
&gt;
&gt;Peter Seikel in Freigericht near Frankfurt/Main recommends the &quot;N&quot; absorbers.
&gt;Seikel used to develop racing and off-roading suspensions for all kinds of VW
&gt;and Audi also the T3 syncros he is probably the most experienced person about
&gt;these items. Give him a call or better a fax it is worth while. He also offers
&gt;reinforced coil springs for the T3 syncro.
&gt;
&gt;Auto Seikel GmbH
&gt;Herr Peter Seikel
&gt;Industriestrasse 5
&gt;D 63579 Freigericht
&gt;Phone: +49 - 60 55 - 52 82
&gt;Fax: +49 - 60 55 - 82 731
&gt;
&gt;Prices:
&gt;        Front spring: DM243 each is $135 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $270 the pair
&gt;        Rear spring: DM315 each is $175 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $350 the pair
&gt;
&gt;        Front shock DM315 each is $175 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $350 the pair
&gt;        Rear shock DM208 each is $115 each _at_ 1.8 exchange = $230 the pair
&gt;
&gt;        So you have a full setup of heavy duty springs and shocks for $1,200
&gt;
&gt;Another adress you could try is:
&gt;projektzwo
&gt;Herr Rissmann
&gt;Saarburgstrasse 13
&gt;D 86899 Landsberg
&gt;Phone: + 49 - 81 91 - 92 77 - 0
&gt;Fax: +49 - 81 91 - 92 77 - 99
&gt;
&gt;projektzwo sells mostly show stuff, but does have some rather nifty fender
&gt;flairs and brush bars and a lift kit for Syncro's using the stock stiffer &quot;N&quot;
&gt;shocks, and hey, it's a real flashy brochure.  You could drool over the thng
&gt;for hours, and it's only 3 pages, double sided.
&gt;
&gt;A local contact for projektzwo is VW Sports - 703-451-5134  Springfield VA
&gt;
&gt;*************
&gt;That's all I know now.  I continue to look for the OEM for the &quot;N&quot; suffix, and

I think, suspect that the OEM for N is Boge itself. I bet we could order Ns
through a European equivalent to FLAPS.

&gt;will probably just break down and get from Seikel in the near future.  (that
&gt;is if I can get ahold of Derek Drew and ask him how you order overseas.  I'm a
&gt;bit nervous about that, never having done it before.)

I recomend you have the order sent government postal mail, ground surface on
a credit card. Otherwise, ask the party if they can cash a USA$$ check and
just sent them a check.
