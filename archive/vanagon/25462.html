Among other chit-chat Rusty told Martin Garramone:

I think you are really referring to &quot;How to Hot Rod VW Engines by Bill
Fisher, Published by H.P. Books copyright Tucson, Arizona copyright 1970.
The address in the book shows H.P. Books P.O. Box 50640 Tucson, Arizona
85703. Credit was given to &quot;Bookediting and Coordination&quot; by James E.Lincoln
and &quot;Book Assembly&quot; by George Crawford. This book is far more indepth (than
another book mentioned) and helpful. A good detective would take these leads
and track these folks down (if still alive) starting in Tucson. Otherwise I
would definitely keep my eyes peeled at every used book store and swapmeet
that I ran into. As far as the publishing address is concerned keep in mind
that we are talking 25-26 years already! Sheesh I feel like a total fossil
!!!!!!! Eeeeeeks! I bought my copy at a used book store for $5.95. I have
seen other copies. I will snag other copies and let the list know if I find
any more. I'm always willing to spread the wealth. =)
