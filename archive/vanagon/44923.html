Subject: Shifter Knog

Okay, here's the idiot question for the day...

How do I remove the shifter knob (or what is left of it) from my '80 
Vanagon.  The knob itself is pretty much toast, but there is a hard 
plastic insert that is fastened to the shift lever and this won't 
budge.  Is it screwed, glued or press-fit onto the shifter?

Any tips would be gratefully appreciated....

Thanks,
