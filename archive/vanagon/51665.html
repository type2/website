Subject: Re: (Fuel filter) What a Long Strange Trip It's Been

&gt; The small filter before the fuel pump was recalled on my 86GL leaving
&gt; only the big silver one after the pump.  Something about only needing
&gt; the small one for manufacturing debris.  I think the small one also
&gt; leaked, another reason to do without.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know about your years, but mine was a definite recall item.

This is true, BUT I've seen the same filter on buses for like 20 years
with never a leak (not that they were on there that long) we opted to
leave the filter on our '86, personal experience combined with the
want to not replace $250 fuel pumps all the time.
