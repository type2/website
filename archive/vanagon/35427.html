Subject: Re: VW Bus Heaven ??

&gt;Anyone know what happened to these guys?  I was calling to see if they
&gt;had a door for my bus which got mangled today.  A recording came on
&gt;and said the # had been disconnected.  Did they close shop, or
&gt;just move or something??
&gt;

I tried the 1-800 # too and it doesn't seem to be working.  They ARE still
in business though, you can reach them at (617) 582-1482.  They claim the
1-800 number is working, but I can't get through with it.

Their address is:

VW BUS HEAVEN
Jones River Ind. Park
20 Wapping Road
Kingston, MA 02364

(617) 582-1482
