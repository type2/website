Subject: 67 Bus Master Cylinder

Hi everybody, my 67 bus is in desperate need of a master cylinder, the 
dual circuit kind.  I was wondering if anyone had one, new or used.  Also
does anyone have any inforation about changing ot an old style master
cylinder?  I am not clear if the pushrod is the same length or not and I
thought if it was too long it might damage the master cylinder.  Does anyone
know anything about a rebuild kit for the 67 master cylinder and how well
they work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
