&gt;advance for any advice,
 Rick, my Vanagon had the same problem (developed it after I had the
drivers door worked on). I found the problem was caused by the people
who had &quot;fixed&quot; the door for me. They had removed the inside panel on
the door and had pulled the plastic loose that had apparently been
placed behind the panel by VW as a vapor barrier/wind barrier. A
little glue was all that was needed to fix the problem.
