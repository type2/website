Are you talking about the tank itself or all the stuff on top of it? There
is a recall in effect for a lot of the Vanagons to have the tank, filter,
and control unit replaced. Nothing to do with leaking, as far as I know. It
has leaked ever sense they changed the tank. They told me it would be $180
to repair. I still think they should have replaced all the stuff on top of
the tank as part of the recall, just as a safety precaution. But VW says
no. :(  They seem to think that leaving the old hoses and stuff in place
after the stress of removing to replace the tank is OK. I would think this
is a safety hazard that they could be responsible if anyones bus burnt
after pulling out of one of they're dealers shops having one of these
recalls performed. What do you people think???

&gt; There seems to be an unusually large number of people who are
&gt; reporting gas tank leaks, myself included. From what I can tell it seems
that
&gt; the problem is a design defect - not a consumer defect. Has anyone ever
&gt; called the
&gt; NTSA hotline (1-888-DASH-2-DOT) To see if they would be interested in
&gt; investigating
&gt; the problem as a candidate for a recall?
&gt; 
&gt; Seems like a legitimate concern to me.
