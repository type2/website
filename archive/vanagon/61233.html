&gt; Had a flat this weekend.  Noticed that Sears would repair it for free,
&gt; 'cause that's where I bot the tires.  Hours later...the mechanic drives
&gt; it into the shop, and is about to jack up my Vanagon BY THE ENGINE!
&gt; I scream, then point out the jack point forward of the wheel.
&gt; Next, he is about to use his powerful air wrench on the PLASTIC WHEEL
&gt; COVER FAKE BOLTS!  More just in time screaming.
&gt; Takes tire off, is about to remove tire from wheel when I remind him he
&gt; hasn't found the leak yet.  Get his boss over to help him... I end up
&gt; finding leak 15 minutes later.  Boss helps this dummy patch tire,
&gt; doesn't work.  So boss drills tiny leak hole out to a HUGE hole, then
&gt; patches it with a HUGE plug.
&gt; I insist he not use air wrench on nuts, I might have to get them off
&gt; someday.  Show him how to screw on nuts, use a torch wrench.  I wince
&gt; when I think of what would have happened if I had stayed in the waiting
&gt; room.

You should have yanked your van out after the jacking incident.  Reminds
me of a time when I had a chevy chevette (a.k.a shit).  Went to get it
inspected and the guy uses the floor lift, puts the jack feet under the
body.  Starts the lift and here comes the body right off the chassis.  I
proceed over to the air switch and reverse the damn thing.  I then drove
the car out as fast as I could.  MORAL:  I always ask if the mechanic
working on my van has worked on them before.
