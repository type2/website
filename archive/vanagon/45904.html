Subject: workin' type IIs part III

yesterday i was heading up to seattle, then to Bothel, even norther.   but
before i could leave town i had five million errands to run, and in the
midst, of course, remembered that i had forgot something.  so back home to
get the crucial items, and while i was there, deep in mnemnoic trance, Chris
from the farm came over, wanting me to look at the sad motor he had pulled.

did i say that he had done a compression check?   95 in 1,2, and 4, 0 in #3.

the left head was off when i got there, and the rings on #3 had fused to the
pistin, which had pieces eaten out of three places along its sides.  its hard
to describe, but the end result is p&amp;c toast city.      he didn't feel into
rebuilding it, and instead opted to order a rebuild.

well that's that story

but while i was at the machine shop in Seattle, i ran into a friend.    ACKK!
  it's a small world, after all......
