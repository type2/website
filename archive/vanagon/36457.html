&gt; All,

&gt; I've been thinking (now,now David don't hurt yourself), since the busses
&gt; in Mexico are watercooled, do they suffer the same head gasket leaks
&gt; that the Vanagons get?  If not then why don't those that are looking at
&gt; replacing the heads of their Vanagons look in to ordering them from
&gt; VWoMex? If they do then the point is moot of course.
&gt; 
&gt; Someone who speaks spanish could call them and ask if they are running
&gt; into complaints from owners regarding head leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; Just a thought,
