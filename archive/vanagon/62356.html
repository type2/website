&lt;&lt; Now, another question. My '88 Westy only has a mud flap on the driver's
side.
 Is this normal, or am I missing my right-side one? &gt;&gt;

VW was to cheap to provide a pass side mudflap (at  85 bucks a pop, I wonder
why!)
so, Only the drivers side was standard, to protect the propane tank from
rocks and road debris.
