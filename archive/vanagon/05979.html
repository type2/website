Mothballs (NAPTHALENE) and Moth Crystals (PARADICHLOROBENZINE) should NOT be
used in this fashion. Take it from a bug-guy. These materials (oh, and also
don't use VAPONA) are very hazardous to your well being. For a lengthy
discussion try the entomo-l archives. We use these things sparingly in
permanently housed bug collections. Prolonged exposure to these may cause a
number of problems.
  Better to live trap the offenders and release in a field somewhere a few
miles down the road (HAWK FOOD).
