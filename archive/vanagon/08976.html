Hi,

I recently sold my '76 camper and just acquired an '87 camper (thanks,
Joel for your help on what to look for and how much to pay).

It's time to start repairing and replacing and I'm stumped on how
to remove the fresh water pump from the water tank. How do the water
tubing clamps release? Is there a special tool or do you tear it off
and replace it? How about the electrical connections to the pump?

Anyone know a good place to get a new skylight? This one is cracked.
I tried WCM but no luck. They recommended Bus Boys (never heard of them)
but they're closed until Jan 2. I'm hoping to avoid the dealer :(

Thanks in advance!

Jeff
