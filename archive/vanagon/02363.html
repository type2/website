&gt; Don't know if this applies but...this has been studied.  In a 
&gt; university somewhere.  I think it was sociologists.  They determined 
&gt; that if you took any two people in the country, at random, there are 
&gt; only five people between as friends.  This was an average.  I think it 
&gt; has been duplicated.  In other words, anyone of you could give me the 
&gt; name of someone you work with and I would ask a friend who has a 
&gt; connection to that city who might ask a friend who had the same line 
&gt; of work, etc. until someone knew that person.  It only takes five.  

Hmm,  This _is_ true!  Let's see, my mother went to nursing school
with a woman who went to high school with Elvis Presley.  Now, we know
that Elvis knows Priscilla Presley, who's now married to Michael Jackson.

Michael knows LaToya, of course, even though she's been ostracized by the
family lately.  I guess it's up to me hook the Bricks Across America 
with the Psychic Friends Network.  Who has cellphones, and who would
be willing to play the part of &quot;psychic&quot;?

And, umm, are there any channelers out there that could hook me up with
the King?  I hear that he's kind of hard to reach lately by phone.
