Subject: Thanks for e-brake help!, Torsion bar adj. update

A public thanks to Brad Spear and Bob Hoover for their quick responses to
my question about how to unhook the emergency brake cable!  After reading
them I went back out and found the clip and removed it, but the cable still
didn't want to push back out through the sleeve in the backing plate.  But
I was able to pull the other end of the sheath from where it fit in the
metal tube leading to the front (since I had unhooked the front end of the
cable to provide slack).  This gave me enough room to move the bearing
housing to the rear, where I supported it on a cement block.

Well, I've got one side adjusted now.  Nothing SUPER hard, but just a
bunch of little things that added up.  The big bolts holding the spring
plate, diagonal arms and bearing housing were very rusty and one fought
every inch of the way.  Then the problem with the cable, which meant
unhooking it up front, etc.  Had to take the drum off to unhook that end,
and it didn't want to come off but eventually did.  Getting the brake
shoes off was even kind of a job, compared to what I was used to on other
cars.  But eventually I measured the spring plate angle and it was about
22.5 degrees from what I could tell.  No way can you get down to the minute
level they talk about in the books, at least not with any protractor level
*I* could find.  Actually, the 22.5 is about what the book says they're
supposed to be.  HVW did an article on this procedure a few years back and
when they measured theirs, they were about the same as this.  They ended up
setting them to close to 27 degrees and said it made the rear end about an
inch higher.  I did the same on mine.  I could have maybe used a little
more lift but didn't want to get carried away and overstress the torsion
bars.

Got the spring plate back resting on its stop and bolted its cover back on,
and started the four bolts for the bearing housing/diagonal arm/spring
plate, and called it an afternoon.  Tomorrow I'll put the brakes back
together and line up the marks I made on the housing, etc. and tighten
everything up, then maybe I'll start on the other side if the weather stays
warm.  Now that I've had a little practice, that side should maybe go
quicker.  :-)

Again, thanks for your help.  (After reading your replies, I checked back
in the manuals and found at least one picture I must have overlooked
before.)
