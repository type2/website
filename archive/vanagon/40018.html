Subject: trailors...

OK, I know there was a ton of information on trailors recently, but since 
I figured that I wouldn't be towing anything any time soon, I just 
deleted them, now, I am having to tow my new bus home this weekend, not 
from my bus, but from my dad's explorer...is there any important things 
we ought to know be fore towing a bus...I just wanted to make sure cause 
I know there were quite a few messages a week or so ago on the topic...I 
know, I should have just read them then, but...
Dallas...oh yeah, we have a tow bar we have borrowed from a friend.
