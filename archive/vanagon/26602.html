Subject: 5millionth Chrysler Minivans (F)

**(This one deserved the changing of the .sig back to the rvb tag)**

I saw on the news this week that Chrysler held a parade to honor the new
owners of the 5 millionth min*van. News report showed the happy owners with
payment book in their hands riding on a float with the van/car/POS waving at
crowds of people. My wife and I just about did one of those infamous Danny
Thomas pratfall coffee spits when the TV announcer reported that Chrysler
said that they wanted to pay a tribute to the Dodge/Chrysler Mini/baby van
as it was the hands down, undisputable, most produced, and all-time most
popular van ever produced. 

Does this mean I ought to start watching for hoards of white shirt-red
suspendered yuppies chauffeuring yuppettes with asymetrical haircuts dressed
in those shapeless dresses that make their butts look big (sitting in back
seat) with drooling booger nosed babies (front seat) caravaning around the
country following the Yanni\Linda Evans~Windham Hill Tour? Well break out
the crystals and psuedo, wannabe Native American rituals! Oh Bif!, make mine
a Mocha Double Cappachino. Grrrr... (Not!)

7 year, 70,000 miles huh? I wonder what the Westy is worth? Hmmm... ;)
