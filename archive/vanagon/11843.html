&gt;Also Thom, I talked to my electronics prof. about your 6 to 12 volt 
&gt;converter.  first thing he asked was how small do you want to make it!  It 
&gt;seems to be not much of a problem to make a converter for 6-12 at 5.5 amps 
&gt;output.  He drew the scematic for me, and I simulated it, but haven't 
&gt;finished a design.  Basically, once you have the design, this thing could be 
&gt;as small as a fist, and cost 20 -30 bucks.  The design is theoretically 100% 
&gt;efficent, but that would drop a little.  Let us know what you're going to do.

A guy on this list, Wouter De Waal (I've prolly butchered the name) 
came up with an _exact_schematic, down to the part numbers, etc, but
I don't know enough to know where to start.  I've done a little breadboarding,
but I might be over my head on this one, and I wouldn't wanna blow a bunch
of cash and fry some parts!

His circuit would give me 3.5A at 12V, at about 85% efficiency, but 
involves some special IC 'n stuff I don't really understand.
