Gerry,
LIST ABUSERS? You talkin' to me? You talkin to me? huh?
Of course you are!
I'd be happy to buy you $5.00 worth in trade for all of the times that you
have had  (or will have)  ;) reason to kick my smart ass off of the list.
As you know, I see it as my job to stir the waters when it gets dull. I try
to stop just short of the Vintagvw dibble subjects.

&gt;List abusers,
&gt;I'm looking for someone to buy me list stickers. I'd like to have some, but
&gt;I think someone should buy them for me. (What a selfish jerk, eh? &lt;grin&gt;)
&gt;
&gt;So, if you can spare $5 to a good cause (keeping me [somewhat] happy so 
&gt;I keep running the list) I'd appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt;E-mail me directly and I'll get you my snail mail address and a repost of 
&gt;the sticker advertisement if you've lost it.
