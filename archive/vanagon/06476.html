Subject: Re: engine bogging, air flow meters

Jim-
this is exactly what i'm fighting for a year now!!!!!
 an engine surge at 1200-1800 rpm with exactly the
same airflow readings.
 to confuse the issue i tested the airflow meter on another 85 that ran
fine and got the same fluctuations in the airflow meter test in the 1000-2000 range.
PLEASE keep mec posted as to what you find out!!!
