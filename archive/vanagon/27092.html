&gt;I looked at an '87 Westfalia today, Syncro, very nice, 67K miles. It's a GL 
&gt;with locking rear differential and no other options as far as I could tell. 
&gt;The owner is asking $17,500. Is this a reasonable price? I know these are 
&gt;pretty rare, but do they really go for this much?
&gt;
&gt;

This sounds quite steep.  I bought my 87 Syncro (non-camper) in 1991 for
$9,200 and it's probably worth maybe $7 - $8K now.  I can't see that the
camper options could be worth $10,000.  I did see a 1991 Syncro Westy several
months ago with 15,000 miles &amp; loaded with options for about $17 or $18K
though.  It was really pristine.  It looked as though it was still on the
showroom floor.  The curtains looked like they'd never been up. The dealer
said that most of the miles on it were while it was being towed behind a
motorhome.  I would of doubted him, but the condition of the van matched his
story.  Imagine that, towing a Syncro Westy behind your motorhome.  Maybe
they towed a compact car behind the Westy.  Maybe they towed a motorcycle
behind the compact.  Oh well, I'm drivelling now.........

On the other hand, I saw this on the list:
&gt; 90 Syncro Westie
&gt;     One owner (traded in on an Audi Quattro-why not have both?), 70K-80K
&gt;     miles, roll out awning, portapottie (?),TV and VCR, white color, grey
&gt;     interior, &quot;very clean for a vehicle of this age&quot;.

&gt;     Price? He said, &quot;Oh, 19-20, something like that&quot;. Well, I asked him
&gt;     to check. He looks it up...asking $21,995, so I suppose they are
&gt;     hoping to get $19-20. Offer $17!
