I stand with those opposing this split.  I also admit that no one 
asked any of us, or had to.

I would say that personally more than half of the great advice I have 
received from this list has come from people who haven't owned an 
air-cooled bus for decades.  Now, those kind of people might end up on
both lists and they might not.  I have learned to live with deleting 
some messages when I get behind.

All that said, I will be forced to subscribe to both lists.  Still, I 
will be a member of two smaller groups.
