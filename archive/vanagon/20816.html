Subject: Re: bus names

          Our beloved '66 kombi has undergone as many name changes as
          personality changes.  It began as &quot;The Batmobile&quot; when my
          son drove it (and still has the freakin sticker on the
          passenger window as a reminder of those driven hard/zero
          maintenance days).  Then it became &quot;goofy&quot; for a brief
          period when we saved it from certain death (ie: took it away
          from the kid).  A few years back we were sure that Goofy was
          on his way to the knacker due to severe rust and structural
          failure under the cargo entrance.  We took him to an elderly
          gentleman from the fatherland who said he could maybe fix it
          for us.  When we saw what he had done to save our favorite
          vehicle we renamed it in his honor: &quot;Horst&quot;.  And so it
          shall remain.   ray
