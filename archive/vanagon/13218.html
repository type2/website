Subject: Re: need faucet top

We replaced the faucet with a Delta-6 model last summer.  The price has gone
up, currently $60-70 I think.  It was a new style than the original.  The
control is a rotating round knob and the faucet is movable; you can tilt it
up to put large containers underneath.  That's kind of nice.
