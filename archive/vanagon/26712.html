 As my bikes were always breaking down at one time or another, I made the
 table top big and thick enough to double as a ramp. When it was 
 needed, it would just slot into the groove below the sliding door, the 
 other end on the deck. Stand along side the bike, rev gently and it would 
 drive up the ramp and into the bus.

 Getting it out was alot more awkward though.
