&gt;Re:Potty Mouths...
...................................

To Joe and All,

Occasionally I have ventured close to the edge but make an attempt to stay
to &quot;this side&quot; of decency. I tend to make my point with humor and if the
point is slightly off color it may come across in a double entendre that
younger readers might not get and that sensitive folk might smile at and
over look. On the other hand I am eager to poke fun at myself, the VW
Concourse &quot;gods&quot; and everyone else in sight. The Rusty VanBondo character
originally was/is the combination of all personalities that I have
encountered in the VW world. Count me in as a pollitical cartoonist of the
written word. Direct usage of sexual and potty related words, as well as
practice of the -isms are fervently avoided. 

Good point Joe!
