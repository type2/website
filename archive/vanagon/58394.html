Subject: High idle (possible fix)

Two nights ago my 87 syncro started idling at about 2000 rpm. The next morning
it was fine until I got off the freeway and found the idle up at 3000 (where
it decided to stay). It did this as soon as it warmed up slightly until today
when I found a broken end of a spring sticking out from under the idle
stablizer (and it was attached to the rest of a good spring that was somewhat
obscured by the tubing on top of the engine) that ran from the air distribution
manifold to the upper arm  on the throttle valve - this meant that there was
not enough tension pulling against the wound spring on the throttle valve
shaft to close the valve all the way (it didn't completely close of its own
accord even with the accelerator cable removed from its clamp). 

	I fished the spring out from under the idle stablizer, bent a new
little hook in the end and attached it to the top arm on the throttle valve
(not the arm to which the accelerator cable attaches) and it now pulls the
throttle valve closed.

	Is the spring that is wound around the throttle valve shaft supposed
to produce enough torque to fully close the throttle valve itself? Can I
replace that spring if it is (the nut on top of the throttle valve has a
crimped washer underneath it that prevents me from disassembling the valve
for inspection without destroying that washer). The throttle valve is not
covered in the Bentley at all so I am in the dark as to its &quot;proper&quot; behavior.
