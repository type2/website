Subject: Uprated headlight bulbs

A while ago james catterson said:

&gt; i just substituted 60/100 bulbs for the stock 55/60's
&gt; on the low beam side of my 91 synchro....i doubt that
&gt; the headlight switch will last forever...

Has anyone else tried this?  Did the switch(es) survive?
100/55 bulbs are easy to obtain in the UK.  Do I *need* to fit
a relay or will the switch(es) take the extra current?

The current through the switch is presently 10A (2 * 60/12), it
will increase to 17A (2 * 100/12).
