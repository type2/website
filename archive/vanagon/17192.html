&gt;When its time to get shocks try the KYBs,  stiff,  stable,  lifetime
&gt;guarantee!  And alot le$$ than the eurosnob brands...350 per tankfull!!!

does KYB even make shocks for vanagons?? that's one of the problems with
non-vw shocks: finding someone that makes them. Koni makes them in Holland,
but few dealers want to import them over here (it seems).

&gt;How many gallons does your tank hold???   I get 26mpg with my boxer and
&gt;I run out of gas at around 290 miles,  whats the secret?

??? you should have 16 gallons like the rest of us. i get only about 20 mpg
but i can go for 300-310 miles on the 16 gallons before getting really
really nervous (usually, i fill up at 250-280 miles).

if you get 26 mpg in a camper (!?!?) but only go 290 miles, you've got some
sort of blockage or something .... that's only about 11 gallons!!!!

inquiring minds want to know.
