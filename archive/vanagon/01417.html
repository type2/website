&gt;&gt; The problem with these engines (the 2.7) was the case was not really strong
&gt;
&gt; Presumably detuning a 2.7 would help (providing it wasn't too far gone to
I'm not sure how far you could de-tune it.  Apart from possibly jetting down
the carbs, and changing the timing, it doesn't seem like there's a lot to
do.  Its not like the venerable VW, where you have 100 different carbs available...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The 78 and later motors are probably some of the best in the world.  There are
&gt;&gt; stories of people getting 300,000 to 400,000 miles on them.  I would put one
&gt;
&gt; The engine was redesigned for this, presumably, so I guess there are
&gt;compatibility issues between these and the earlier engines?
&gt;
The later engines are a bolt-in item (between 911's)  with the exception of 
fuel injection issues.  The later engines were either DME or Jetronic, so 
Its doubtful that someone who has a car with a 2.7 is prepared to handle
the FI without some work.  The shop I takemy car to (my Porsche) recently
converted a '71 911 from the 2.2 to a 3.2.  The got about 125 hours of
labor for it, too.  The guy supplied his own engine.  The labot figure
is a little high 'cause they had to do some tranny work to - his was 
going out.  This guy obviously had more money than he knew what to do with...

//The short of it is that there wouldn't be much difference in bolting up
//a 3.2 or a 3.2 (or how 'bout one of the late 80's 3.6's? :)

Another avenue, though, is to make the conversion but use carb's instead.
PMO sells CA street legal carb kits.  Or you could have one of the two
places I know of update a mechanical fuel injection unit to owrk with
the bigger engine.  Pleas note that MFI was used with raging success on
the early 911RS and 911RSR, 962, 917, and a few others.

I have taken this beyond the original topic, I'm sure.  But those who are
still brave enough to take the plunge...
