So Berry Kercheval says:
&gt; 
&gt; We did this again, but this time we let the car die from lack of fuel, and 
&gt; tried pugging it all back together.  It won't run for more than 20 seconds, 
&gt; and then dies.
&gt; 
&gt; I've put the battery back on the charger to restore the lost amps from all the 
&gt; cranking, and I'm going to let the fuel in the system evaporate overnight, but 
&gt; my plaintive question is,
&gt; 
&gt; WHY does the thing run when I unplug the fuel pump and die when I plug it back 
&gt; in?  Is the intake manifold awash in too much gas?  Is it likely to be OK in 
&gt; the morning?

I believe that whenever you turn the key to the on position your fuel pump pressurizes
the the fuel line system.  So, when you unplug the relay, the fuel lines are still
full of fuel and are under the same pressure.  When you run the engine the fuel is 
burned until the pressure dissipates in the system and then the motor dies from the
lack of fuel pressure.
