&gt; &gt; Just found that the right inboard brake piston is leaking
&gt; &gt; around the boot. I just rebuilt these a couple of months
&gt; &gt; ago. Grr. Anyway, I'd like a show of hands from those of
&gt; &gt; you who think a new set of seals will do the trick, and from
&gt; &gt; those pessimists who think a new caliper is in order.
&gt; 
&gt; I priced the rebuild kits recently, they were about $20/side.  Kind of
&gt; expensive, but I don't think the seals are available separately.  If
&gt; they are, I'd like to know about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, I think new seals would do the trick, as long as the pistons are not
&gt; loose in the bores.

That was the answer I was hoping for. let's hope it works.
BTW, I think I paid about $15/set but that was a couple
years ago, and they'd been sitting around (in the box) in 
the garage until I put them in a few months ago...We'll
see...Thanks.
