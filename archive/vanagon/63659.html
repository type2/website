Subject: bigger  wheels f/ syncro

Hi Derek - or collective Syncronies,
 I missed the posts leading up to the order below. My question is-
What's the largest wheel/tire combo that's practical for a syncro? By
practical I mean without driveshaft or rear trailing arm modifications.
I would, however, be willing to cut out my wheel wells and install the
fender lips to get some 16&quot; on. Derek, is this all you're doing or are
you going full mods? My main goal is more clearance and lower RPM's at
highway speeds.
Gracie,
Jay

PS- Thanks Helmut, you're the man!

&gt; Consider me to have ordered and/or signed up for the group purchase. Horray
&gt; Helmut!
&gt; 
&gt; I'll take three sets of the type *without* the A if this is available--that
&gt; is, I need the 16&quot; kind that requires cutting off part of the fender. The
&gt; 14&quot; version won't do.
&gt; 
&gt; DM300 x 1.8 = $166. At that price, I'll take *three* sets.
