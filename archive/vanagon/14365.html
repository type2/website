Subject: RE: WTB: pre 68 Panel Van

&gt;I believe that the newly DeLurked Kevin said he had a '67 Panel Parts Bus that
&gt;he had no plans for.  You might try to find out where he is.  I seem to
&gt;remember that his e-mail was something like kevin6966_at_AOL_dot_com

Kevin the lurker:

would you mind posting me you e-mail address so i could bug you about your
pre' 68 Panel Van parts

thanks,

michael
