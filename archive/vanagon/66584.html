Subject:      1.9L longblock and auto tranny FS

Hi Volks,

I need to get rid of the 1.9L engine that came out of my now '85 Westy
2.1L. I only drove it around the block before the pull to confirm it
needed head gaskets, and yes, it does. The auto tranny is still attached
and seems to work fine. Oh, according to the PO's receipt, VWoA rebuilt
this engine 80K ago to the tune of $2300! I need to get it out of the
back of my work truck so best reasonable offer accepted.

I forgot to mention where I'm located in Cincinnati, Ohio
