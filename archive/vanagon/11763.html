Subject: Red Rock Potluck


Ok, I've sort of &quot;tallied&quot; the responses from those of you who bothered
to make them regarding potluck food at Red Rock.  The general consensus
seems to be to do a grill-your-own-meat on Friday evening, and bring
a side-dish to share.  This could be:  bread,
salad, dessert, etc.

For Saturday, the feeling has been to have a chili-fest, with 
emphasis on the Southwest cuisine  This would include side dishes
like cornbread, salad, dessert, etc.

I therefore suggest that you all sign up for what you wish to
contribute TWICE, and I'll be happy to keep track of it.  

So, folks, let's hear from you on what you wish to bring 

Friday
and
Saturday

I don't need to know what you want to grill, since that will be just for
you and yours, but only the side dishes.  On Sat., I need for some
people to bring chili, or make it there, and a suggestion was made
to have several different types:  texas firehouse, turkey, veggie,
etc.  

Let me know!

Also, let's everyone bring whatever
kinds of spirits THEY want, rather than trying to &quot;potluckize&quot; that
category.  Anyway, I don't think any one person could bring enough
beer to suit SOME people I know on this list  :)
