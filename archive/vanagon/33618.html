Subject: NATO specs/Tires

Hi folks!

Recently someone posted info on a vanagon crew cab for sale that was fitted
to NATO specs.  I recall seeing a Land Rover for sale in a recent Hemmings
Motor News that had NATO specs.  I think bullet proof tires were mentioned
in the ad.  Now what is the reinforcement coding for bullet proof tires, for
those of us who want that extra stiff, safe drive?  Is anyone in NY or LA
using these tires now and can you give performance data?

In all seriousness, I'm curious as to what modifications are made to bring a
van up to NATO specs and how bullet proof tires are designed.
