Subject: '58 camper for sale
Date: Tue, 20 Feb 1996 10:52:35 -0800 (PST)

Volks,
	This morning I went and looked at a '58 camper for sale here in San
Diego for $1300.  It was advertised as having no rust and a tent.  I
arranged to meet the lady at 8:00 am. this morning.
	I arrived at her house about 3 minutes after 8.  There were two
older breadloaves out front, which looked to be in pretty nice shape, so
I was encouraged despite the run-down neighborhood I was in.  The house
was completely surrounded by a chain link fence and had a rather mean
looking dog tied up onside.  There was no way to the door and no bell or
anything I could use to announce my arrival.  I called out a few times
but heard nothing.  I decided to walk around to the rear and look for
the bus.  I found it in a separate fenced off area behind the house.
Looked reasonably straight.  I called out again a few times to no avail.
I went back to my camper, started it up, and drove around the side of
the house.  Stopped, revved the motor a few times thinking the noise
would attract the attention of the resident.  Nope.  I shut off my
camper and got out one more time to look over the fence at the bus.
Just as I was ready to give up (was alomst 8:15 now) a young woman
appeared.  I was a little annoyed by this point but I greeted her and
she took me over to see the bus.
	Now I don't know that much about older busses, but thanks to Thom
Fitzpatrick's posts I knew a little about where to look for rust.  I
went straight to the rocker panels and was immediately disappointed.
The passenger side rocker panel was a bottomless shell clinging to the
body for dear life.  The drivers side rocker appeared solid, but the
entire bus looked like it had a layer of bondo over it and I couldn't
tell what was filled and what wasn't.  The floor under the front mat was
reasonably solid, but there was surface rust and some pinholes here and
there.  She showed me an area behind the drivers seat in the cargo area,
proudly proclaiming, &quot;It rusted through but we repaired it with a piece
of galvanized steel, then plywood and carpet&quot;.  What I saw was a hole
big enough to put my size 11 foot through, completely un-repaired, with
a piece of plywood covering it.  I didn't bother to ask her where the
galvanized steel was.  There was considerable rust bubbling through at
the seam above the front bumper, and in the wheelwells, and the battery
tray was rusted completely out.  The battery was sitting on plywood that
was magically suspended in mid air (well, there was probably a little
metal left supporting it).  There was surface rust around the seam in
the roof (the rain gutter?) which was starting to get serious in places,
but could probably be fixed without welding.
	Okay, that's all of the major rust problems.  Other problems
included missing passenger door panel, sunroof (hatch?) over the drivers
seat sloppily sealed (could this possibly be original?  It was funky
looking), shag carpeting inside, ID tag behind drivers seat missing,
engine hatch fastener missing, radio hole butchered, engine compartment
roof covered with black crusty stuff - almost looked like there had been
a fire in there at one time.  Also, it appeared that someone had
installed hasps on most of the doors and hatches at one time.
	If you've read this far, you should be rewarded, so here's the good:
Complete engine (from what I can tell) including tin, original 6V with
battery, supposedly runs (I didn't hear it though).  Mostly new rubber
all around, no visible rust around the windshields.  All glass intact
except for one of the camper windows in the door.  Windows were the
aluminum frame ones that pop out, three on drivers side, two on
passenger side (in doors).  Decent tires, good front seat, decent
camping interior consisting of a fold out bed and some cabinets, and two
suspiciously original looking folding tables, one in the middle of the
drivers side wall, and the other on the forward cargo door on the
passenger side.  I couldn't find any indication of what type of camper
this was, or if it was just someone's custom job.  All of the door
handles (except the aforementioned engine latch) were there and
resonably operational.  Doors seemed solid.  AND there was something
with a canvas cover over it mounted above the passenger side rain
gutter.  She claimed it was a tent, but I think it was just an awning.
It looked very old, and she declined to open it up because the snaps
were rotting out and she was afraid she wouldn't be able to get it back
together again.  There were snaps down the sides of the bus indicating
that at a minimum this awning had some sort of sides to it.  
	From a distance, this bus doesn't look too bad.  I would describe it 
as &quot;straight&quot;, but that's all.  For a '58, it may be in pretty good
shape, I don't know.  I wouldn't want to tackle it myself as a project
but someone with a welder might be able to make this into a nice bus
again.  I recorded the VIN and engine numbers so that someone could
maybe get more info on the bus.  Here they are:

ENGINE:		D 061316X
VIN:		281927
LICENSE:	CA 881 AUF  Expires 4/96

I couldn't find an ID plate on the bus so I got the VIN# off of the pink
slip.  I took about 8 pictures of this bus, and if anyone is seriously
interested I will put them up on the web.  I don't have any association
with the owner of this bus - I just thought it might be of interest to
someone on the list.
