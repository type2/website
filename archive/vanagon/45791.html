&gt;416848.  It was on the little plate, and stamped into the 
&gt;tranny tunnel.  Clara good friend, does your magic book shed some 
&gt;light?  Thanks!- - 
&gt;
&gt;your bus is a very early 59,  buildt 1 Jan 59 !   pretty neat.
&gt;

Clara-
According to the info on the body tag on my '59 Panel #423794, its
manufacture date was 12/31/58. Any ideas on this? His tag should have his
date of manufacture on it.

dates i have:
22 dec  58      420 574
29 dec 58       422 670        (tail light position changed)
31 dec 58       
 
2     jan  59       422 999         (rear wheel cylinder- seat of push rod
rubber boots modified)
5     jan 59        425 412
5     jan   59      425  461
these numbers come from the book of progressive changes, by vw  to 61

the number i had before i was looking at the list of chassis and unit
numbers, described as month end figures.     the chassis number for dec 58 is
416 082.  hmm- that doesnt jive with your number.  

  the parts list (updated to 73)production survey lists the last bus made in
58 as 423 156, which agrees with your  '59 Panel #423794 being a 12/31/58
 buildt bus, but not with the changes listed in the progessive changes book.

the 58 ed of parts list   says nothing helpful as it is the april 58 edition.

funny, isn't it?  now my faith in the books put out by vw for the dealers is
completely shattered.    i might as well go cal look now.  :(
