In this week's Autoweek they have some spy pictures of a red and a black
one parked outside some restaurant in Mexico City.  They look wicked
cool! Due out next year they speculate.

&gt;     Though not strictly a Vanagon issue, I thought I'd pass this along:
&gt;
&gt;     A few weeks ago, I signed up as an &quot;interested&quot; party of the New
&gt;     (Concept) Beetle on the V.A.G. (Germany) web page.  Yesterday, I got
&gt;     an envelope from Germany with a somewhat informative letter about the
&gt;     new car and a complimentary pin/tie tack depicting the design of the
&gt;     car as &quot;two little bumps under a bigger bump&quot; meant to represent the
&gt;     side profile of the car.  Pretty cool.
