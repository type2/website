Subject: Abandoned '85 Westy in Mt. Vernon, NY


I saw this on Usenet and thought that I would pass it along...

'86 Westfalia


I've noticed a brown Westy sitting at the Fleetwood train station for
the entire month and a half that I have lived here.  Went by it today,
and noticed it has a towing sticker on it, so it'll be gone soon.
Called the police station to see what will happen to it.  They say it
will be auctioned if worthwhile.  The number to call to find out more
is 914-665-2501.  Might be a nice deal for someone.

The inspection sticker expired in '96 - says it is an '85 with 98,000
miles.  My cursory inspection didn't reveal any rust, though there
were a few dings.  I can check it more closely if someone is
interested - I'm only two blocks away.  Inside looks decent -
everything appears to be there.  I don't know if it runs, obviously.
