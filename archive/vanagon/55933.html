Subject: Re: &quot;thing&quot; on steering column

In a message dated 97-02-12 22:34:09 EST, you write:

&gt; I've looked int the &quot;thing&quot; on the steering column and there are no clues
on 
&gt; the inside either.  You mentioned heater switches for seats? 

The seat heat switches are little thumwheel style knobs where you can see the
perimeter of the knob, but not it's face.  Yours doesn't have these.

&gt; Perhaps a cruise control switch?  

A good guess, but Vanagon cruise controls are built into the turn signal
stalk (when equipped with cruise of course).

&gt; The plastic on the inside of the raised area is 
&gt; &quot;perforated&quot; so it can be broke out, but I don't know what would go
inside--
&gt; Sorry, B Julian

Perhaps it is the steering column cover that is used with the seat controls,
but without the controls themselves.  Maybe the factory just ran out of the
&quot;normal&quot; covers and decided to use the ones like yours in a few vans.  Or,
maybe just a mistake??

Thanks for the follow up.
