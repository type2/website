Subject:      anybody heard from William Warburton???

anybody gotten any more postcards/letters/phone calls/requests for bail
from William Warburton?? last i heard he was in Peru and that was last
christmas, i think. he should have made it up to the u.s. by now ... ???

&lt;for all those who don't know, he was an early member of the list, who sold
his bus and left the UK for a trip of the Americas.&gt;
