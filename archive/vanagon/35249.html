Subject: Engines Question

I am curious as to what a consensus would be.  I need to get an engine for
my  resto-project and can not decide to do either:

A)  Buy a used but not rebuilt engine froma junkyard or some available
source and rebuild it myself which was my whole intent - use this project
as a reason to learn all about the car.

B) Get one from one of the mail order places.

Some concerns:

1.  I would rather have the engine numbers fall withing the range for my
year because I figure if I am going to do this I might as well start off
right.  Is this possible?

2.  Which avenue would cost less?  If the Mail order option will this
significantly hurt my ability to 'learn' the process?

Thanks

-Marlin
