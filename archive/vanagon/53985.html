&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Another problem i have been experiencing since purchase about 1.5
&gt; &gt; years ago
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is the No-start symptoms.  This happens at any temperature, but more
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; frequently when it is cold outside.  I turn the key and all i hear is
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; slight hum, which i think is the fuel pump.  Sometimes if i hold the
&gt; &gt; key on
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for awhile it will finally turn over and start.  If this doesn't work,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; usually waiting 20 min or so will work.  The battery is fine, brand
&gt; &gt; new.  Is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the solution the Ford solenoid?  where can i find the details on this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, I had this same problem and I ended up replacing the starter.
&gt; &gt;  Apparently what happens is that the starter motor turns, (thus the hum)
&gt; &gt; but the binhex doesn't pull out to engage with the flywheel to turn the
&gt; &gt; engine over.  One way to get the Vanagon going is to go under the van and
&gt; &gt; while someone turns the key, hit the starter motor with a hammer until it
&gt; &gt; engages.  A couple of weeks ago it was 9 degrees in upstate NY and I
&gt; &gt; refused to go under the Van to start it.  I have no idea why the starters
&gt; &gt; do that but that's how to solve it.
&gt; &gt; I bought a Bosch reman starter for $160 in my area and paid a mechanic
&gt; &gt; for 2 hours work.  The dealer wanted $375 for a reman.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you get a solution to the break problem, please share because I have
&gt; &gt; the same exact problem.

&gt; Just a short addition to Nate's comments:
&gt; I've had this same problem with a 1980 Saab (not yet with our 1986
&gt; syncro westy) and I got good results by lubricating the starter shaft
&gt; and bendix gear (the gear that engages the flywheel). I used kerosene as
&gt; a lubricant and sprayed it on.
