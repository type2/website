Subject: Anyone in SEATLE?

I am trying to find someone in Seatle area that can go to a wrecking yard in
Seatle to see if the Vanagons there have any of the parts that I need in
rebuilding my Sycro 4wd Vanagon that suffered an engine fire.

I can compensate you for your time or provide some free parts from several vans
that I am dismantling if anyone is interested and willing to help
