I noticed that on both my recently departed '72 Westy and a friends '73
standard bus the speedos are at _least_ 10% optimistic.  My '73 bus though
is pretty much right on the money.  The two optimistic busses both had
185/70/14 tires while my bus has 195/75/14 but I don't know if that tire
size difference is enough to make that big of a difference in the
speedometer reading.
