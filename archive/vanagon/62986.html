Subject:      Last test today

Ah!  I was wondering why I didn't see copies of my email, as I did when I
sent to the Vanagon list.  It was because we didn't have 'Repro' turned on.
 I changed the list so that new users will get this option by default.

If you're currently subscribed and like seeing your mail coming back at you
from the list, then send the following command to listserv_at_gerry.sdsc_dot_edu
or listserv_at_vanagon_dot_com:

     set vanagon repro
