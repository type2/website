&gt; belly pan package? 

Acording to other members of SOTO, the belly pans under the corgo doors 
came on all year bus's that had either a sunroof or double doors.  it was 
to reinforce the body.  the front splash guard panal in front (under the 
front seat area) came on all bus's.  if your is missing, don't worry, 
most of them are.  it was to protect your master cylender and other stuff 
up under there.  they were usually removed to service something in that 
area and never put back on.
hope this helped.
take care and God Bless
