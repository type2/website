Subject: RE: Bolt extraction (Easy-outs work?)


Fortunately, I've only had to use an easy-out once--and it worked just 
fine.  I had to remove the screw attaching the window winder to the the 
winder mechanism, and the phillips head nothes had been rounded out 
terribly by the DPO.  Drilled out the screw a bit, in with the easy-out, 
out with the screw (with liberal application of liquid wrench and patience).

Maybe the difference between my experience and other folks' less happy 
ones is that the winder screw is a small bore, low torque scene, whereas 
exhaust studs are larger, high torqued, and exposed to wild temperature 
ranges.  But the Easy-out worked just fine for me--maybe there are 
limitations on the situations to which Easy-outs are effectively 
applied?  Bob?
