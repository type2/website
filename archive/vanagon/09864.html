&gt; Are there any parking lots in Alexandria?

Steve Alexandria IS a parking lot. It's the back-door-mat for The District.

There is ample parking in front AND in back of the place. Also, it is 
located in a quasi-business/academic locale; on Sundays, at the time we 
plan to be there, you'll have not problem with parking.

Getting there from the District:

	Travel south on I-395 into Virginia.
	Exit on the George Washington Parkway, as though you were going to
	National Airport.
	Travel south until you get to Duke Street (~5 miles). Turn right
	Travel until you see something LARGE and BRIGHT-PINK on your
	front-left. YOU'RE THERE!!!! :)

If you need direction(s) or assistance to meet there, send me a priviate 
message or call me. (703) 550-9099.
