Tom Czierniak replied first and gets to send me a box. Hope
it is useful to you Tom.

Tim and some others wondered:

&gt; stamps with. Any idea if your pump would suit a newer TDi engine, since
&gt; that's the ideal diesel swap for me. 

No, I don't think it will. VW redesigned the intermediate shaft
drive for the vaccum pump. The oil pump is driven off the
intermediate shaft also, so I wouldn't have my hopes up
that a 1.6l pump fits a 1.9 (also true of the 1.9 IDI)

&gt; PPS: nice web pages, see if you can talk Bob Bellanca (sp?) into sending
&gt; you his TD installation photos for the rogues gallery.

Thanks! Bob, are you listening? I'd be happy to host some pictures
of your 1.9l turbo diesel conversion.
