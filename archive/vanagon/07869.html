Subject: OLD busses (3, or so....)

All I can say about the IRS conversion is...
If you wanted IRS, buy an IRS bus!!!!
(A sentiment echoed by another, anyway...)
Hell, I was raised on 429 and 460 Ford engines...
(I had a `66 Merc Comet Cyclone GT with a 429...Ungodly HP,
race car, street legal _at_ 500 horsies or so....)
120+ mph on highways...been there, done that... for those who
are familiar with the locale...12 MINUTES...SEA-TAC to Olympia...
I have wit(l)neses...
Anyways, if you plan to go above 60 mph...don't get a pre-67 bus.
I, (IMHO) want STYLE, not substance...
Sorry my posts are obscure...ask for a translation...will oblige.
I can go 60 in my bus...55 is the SPEED LIMIT...so I'm OK.
