&gt; &gt;If the old buses have this four-position stalk (I'm not sure if my '78 does
&gt; &gt;or not, I've never tried it) it would be cool if intermittent wipers could
&gt; be
&gt; &gt;retro-fitted to old buses.  I remember someone mentioning something
&gt; &gt;about a wiper relay?  How would one go about finding out if one of the
&gt; &gt;newer relays would fit an older bus?  Intermittent wipers would be nice
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not too familiar with the OEM-type relays. But JC Whitney has several
&gt; add-on interval-wiper kits in their catalog. This might be the perfect
&gt; application...??? Even if it turns out there is no electrical contact in
&gt; the fourth position of your lever (don't ask me), the fourth position
&gt; could be utilized by a strategically-positioned microswitch.

Couldn't we hook something up so I could deal with all those minivan drivers 
who cut me off while talking on their cell phones?
