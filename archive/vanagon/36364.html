&gt;&gt;BTW:The engine is commonly referred to as a &quot;36hp&quot; engine possibly what was
&gt;&gt;considered the &quot;bastard&quot; engine. I think '59 was the year for this engine. I
&gt;&gt;was the short lived transitional engine between the 36hp and the 40hp engines.

Yes, But a 34Hp exists as well, the engine that is known in the US as the 40 Hp
has 34Hp when it's complete with generator, cooling system and exhaust system,
that's why VW specified 34 DIN* Hp for this engine. So forgive us europeans for
talking about a 34 hp :)
