Subject: EV: Some jerk bent my antenna.


Well, last night I came out of a Bar-B-Q restaurant to fine that some --
insert many nasty words here -- person had bent my antenna over.  I bent
it back some, but I'm afraid if I try to bend it anymore, SNAP.  Has any
body had to buy one of these yet?  At least, contrary to the vanagon, it
looks pretty easy to get to.
