Gee, Sole or Cod or that kind of fish would be a good start, yes?&quot;

Sounds good to me, and I think it would be good with seafood in
there, too, like scallops, shrimp, crab, etc., kinda like a clam
chowder.  I'm hunting recipes and will report soon.  In the meantime,
I've sort of got categories for contributions I'll post here 
separately soon....
