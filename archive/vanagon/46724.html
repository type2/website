Bo,

I'm no expert, like most of the people on the list, but my first guess
would be the temp sensor.  It's anywhere from $30.00 to $40.00 dollars and
very easy to install.  I have seen many articles about the temp sensor
problems in the vanagon archives. 

Good Luck,

&gt; Hi,
&gt; My '89 Vanagon cannot seem to find the right idle speed when the engine
is
&gt; cold.  This is especially true when the A/C is on.  The idle speed
varies
&gt; from 500 - 1200 while the brain is trying to find the proper settings
and
&gt; the engine tends to stutter or stall on acceleration.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem disappears as soon as the engine warms up.
&gt; 
&gt; Any clues?
