Subject: Re: Magnetic Vanagon Window Screens

I purchased a set of these a couple of years ago. I keep them stored over
the engine on a flat piece of cardboard. On a hot buggy day they are
invaluable. 

The company that makes these also makes a piece for the sliding door. This
piece doesn't work so good.

&gt;Got JC Whitney Catalog #578J in the mail the other day. On page 92, it lists
&gt;magnetic Vanagon window screens for $33.95 per set (2). It says:      
&gt;
&gt;The part number is 12BP2743R
&gt;
&gt;Their phone number is (312) 431-6102
