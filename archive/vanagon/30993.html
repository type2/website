Subject: Baywindow Cargo Door &quot;Gasket&quot; Hack

Just thought I'd share a pretty simple trick:

Went out to work on the '71 again today and noticed a leak in the rear
hatch.  I've seen this leak before and the bus has had it long before I
rescued her from the PO. But I'm tired of said leak. I'd scoped out prices
for this rear hatch gasket before, but always dismayed by the $$$
required.  The '71 isn't a candidate for resto; she's a resurrection...a
good utility vehicle and hopefully a fun toy for family camping trips and
cross-country solo flights to make conference-going affordable for me. 

I'd noticed that the width of the gasket is about that of a cheap garden
hose. &quot;Broken hose in back yard,&quot; I think.  After cutting and cojoling, I
find that garden hose does in fact fit tightly into most of the spaces
where fresh gasket once was. I managed to cut away all but the most
elegant curves in the gasket, which to my approval appear to be in good
condition. Inserted hose where gasket is no more; no sealer or
adhesive...this is a temporary fix. 

Took about 10 minutes and now the rear hatch doesn't leak. Admittedly, 
there is visible green with the rear door closed and the fit is still a 
little tight, but I guess that's better than getting water inside the bus 
every time it rains...and with time, the garden hose should reshape 
itself a little to make closing the rear door no different than with 
stock gasket.

For my next trick, I may just cut some black hose along one side and 
coerce it over the naked edge of the camper top. I'm more inclined to find 
some thinner black tubing at an auction, though.

Take care! 

Joe ('71 campmobile...looking a little goofy, but dry.)
