Subject: Oil warning

My 87 Synchro turns on the warning oil light and buzz a few seconds after a
startup when it is either low on oil or it is time for an oil change (or so
do i think). In any event the warning lasts about 1/2 a minute and I have
been able to eliminate it (until next time it happens) by either adding or
replacing oil. Have been told that the sensor might be sensing low oil
density an warning me to replace it. Does it make sense?
