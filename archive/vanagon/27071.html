&gt; &gt; For a brief time years back the service stations sold engine oil in plastic
&gt; &gt; 1 litre bags, like milk. I _have_ seen what happens when one of those hits
&gt; &gt; a car windshield at speed &lt;g&gt;, pitched from the rear side vent window of a
&gt; &gt; '71 Westy by my trusty tailgunner. Amazing I made it out of my misguided
&gt; &gt; youth unharmed.

I drove around in my '77 for far too long with a really leaky oil pressure
sensor - I had to keep adding alot of oil, but it sure kept people off my tail!
At least it was *clean* oil splattering on their windshields! ;)
