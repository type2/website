&gt; back end is a white plastic cap with its own tube running up the side
&gt; of the vehicle somewhere; a few wires running off it also.
&gt; 
&gt; A friend took a wild ass guess that it was for the outlet inside. If
&gt; not, how is 12V converted to [110v or 120v]?

&gt; Please cc: to jeffs_at_almaden.ibm_dot_com please, otherwise I won't see the
&gt; answer until Monday - in digest mode.

Oooh!  Oooh!  Finally a question I know something about...

Jeff, that black cylininder thingy in your engine compartment is an 
auxiliary gas heater (you lucky dog!).  Sounds like the one I'm 
installing in my 76 westy.  If so, it's a model BN4.  I'm putting mine in 
the van this weekend, after bench testing it last week, and boy, does it 
crank out the heat!

The white thing coming off the back of it is the air intake. 

There should be a knob by the driver's seat you pull to give it power.  
The relay on mine (pulled mine out of a junk yard for 50 bucks) was 
shot.  This is the relay that gives power to the fuel pump and fan.  VW 
wanted (wait for it...) $103.63 CDN for this dinky relay!!!!  Got another 
relay out of the same junk yard for three bucks.  Moral: If your heater need 
parts, make VW your last resort.

Good luck!

Tobin
