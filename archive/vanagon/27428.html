Subject: VW's in Movies

&gt;From the thread the refuses to die:  I saw a movie last night entitled
&quot;Blood Simple&quot;  It was a kind of mystery comic thing.  That is about 
the best I can explain it.  There is some VW content in here.  One of 
the more sinister characters in the movie drives a 60's bug, I think. 
I am a little sketchy on the years still for bugs.  Anyway, several 
times in the movie the bug is used as a prop to signify that this bad 
guy is around.  I usually go all soft and warm inside when I see a 
bug.  In this case it was a scary thing to see.  Strange.  Go rent it 
if you don't believe me.  Also, the guy is a photographer and in one 
scene he is in the darkroom and there is a collage of shots of the 
bug.  Very cool.
