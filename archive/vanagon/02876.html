Now that I find myself in need of replacement joints, has anyone 
bought/installed the $59.95 J.C. Whitney joints?  Are they 
Mexican/Brazilian? Did you get &gt;10K miles out of them?  (The three words I 
despise most are &quot;Hecho en Mexico) Also, when I pulled the joints from the 
junkyard axle, two needed to be pulled off with the heavy duty puller, but 
the other two just slid off by hand. Which is right?  Does it matter?

I had one of mine replaced with one from my FLAPS at $70+. It's been hanging
there fine for 20+ K miles. I remember my FLAPS told me the joint was the same
one for Mercedes. I looked at its box and yes it was made in West Germany.
