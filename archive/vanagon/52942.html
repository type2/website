Subject: skates?  Whom do I thank?


Sorry for non-VW content:  some kind soul on either the air or
water list (I assume) saw my plea for a pair of those old-fashioned
roller skates.  A set arrived in the mail to me yesterday, but with
no return address, and their note not signed.  It was mailed from
Auburn, CA.  I'd like to know whom to thank for this gracious deed?  :)
