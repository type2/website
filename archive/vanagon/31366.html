Hi Listers &amp; Happy Holidays!

David Easterwood and his 65 Sundial took off from our house in Kansas 
City this morning in the light snow and hopefully he will make it back 
to Georgia without incident.  We worked all day on up til midnight 
yesterday getting the Bus in shape for the journey with moderate success.

It looks like the known problems consist of a low clutch pedal; only one 6 
volt wiper (driver's side); a fairly loose, yet managable kingpin; no 
brake lights (he'll toggle the taillights as needed); and some other 
electrical/lighting problems.  He does not plan on driving at night and 
he plans to stay off the interstates at last report.  With the cold, 
he'll be staying at motels rather than sleeping in the Bus.

The fun part of yesterday's work was installing the full-length metal 
roof rack he bought from me last March.  It really looks good!  Stay Tuned.
