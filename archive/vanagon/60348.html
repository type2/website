re Bosch Platinums.  

I tried them in my 90 Carat, and again in my '89 Syncro.  (Same motor due to a
minor mishap in 95, i.e., we rolled it.)

The Platinum's corroded and wore so badly that after 6 months they were
useless.  I'm really not sure why.  Both local Dealer (West Side VW) parts
guys, and several other reputable contacts I know said stick with the stock
plug.  I'm now on stock plugs, and will see how they wear after a month or
two.

bottom line, I'm not impressed with the Platinums.
