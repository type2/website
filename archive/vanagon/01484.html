Subject: Door handles
Date: Thu, 30 Jun 1994 19:18:33 -0700 (PDT)

Folks,

Since someone else brought up the subject (even though it was 
originally on the newsgroup), I thought I'd add my question/
comment on the subject of door handles.  I found it annoying
when I got my bus that the side door cannot (apparently) be
unlocked without the key.

That was until (I think) I left the front passenger door open
with a bicycle in the back.  I live in East Palo Alto, a 
high-crime area near Stanford University, so bicycles are
very sought-after items when left for the taking.  Some
person tried to relieve me of the bike, but was thwarted
when he realized that the side door would not open no
matter how hard he cranked on the handle.  The reason I know
this is that the next morning I found pieces of the handle
in the back of the bus!  The bike was still there, as was 
about $200 worth of (non-camera) photographic equipment.
I am thankful both that the door did not open and that the
would-be thief did not realize the value of the equiment
despite a remaining price tag.

My problem now is that _I_ can't open the door from the
inside, with or without a key.  Anyone have an idea how
easy it might be to get a replacement door handle?
...and while I'm at it, how easy is it to replace the
window crank (on the front door)?

I appreciate any help/advice/comments....
