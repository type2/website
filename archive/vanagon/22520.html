&gt; &gt;&gt;How many people out there would be interested in
&gt; &gt;&gt;buying a dual exhaust for there wasserboxer?

To which the Coyote queries,

&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, guys, but I have no idea what the point of this would be.  Could
&gt; someone explain?
&gt; 

The idea here is to reduce the exhaust back pressure, thereby allowing
the cylinders to receive more air/fuel mixture per stroke.

Somewhat like drilling out ones cat (I'm trying for Steve's heart too)
to reduce air resistance.

I however beleive that one would only barely notice any extra performance
if there was any at all.  In order to get everything one can out of a
re-designed exhaust, the would need to re-engineer the camshaft to 
different openning times (especially since the inlet would now be able
to open much sooner and for longer, but the exhaust could also).
