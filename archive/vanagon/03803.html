Subject: Re: To those '83-'85 Vanagon folks


Neil,

&gt;&gt; '84 vanagon camper, 103K miles, bought used in '87 at 33K miles.  The only
&gt;&gt; problem is head gasket leaks between cylinder sleeves and heads, happened
&gt;&gt;  at approx 34K, 66K, 102K miles.  I have communicated with you earlier
&gt;&gt; about this.  Am probably going to get the rebuilt engine VW is offering
&gt;&gt; currently, use only VW coolant, and flush/replace coolant each year.  

&gt;My question is: is it really only the '83 - '85 Vanagons that have this
&gt;problem? Or should those of us with later models pay attention to the
&gt;concept of flushing the coolant each year?

   If yours is after '85 and you want to reply directly to me, please do not
   hesitate to do so even I am trying to be focused.

   Every year before the winter comes, I flush/bleed the cooling system.
   I have done this for the last 70k+ miles since 1987 when the head gasket
   cracked due to overheating. The replacement of head gasket costed me
   a lot. To do the flush/bleed correct is very important.

Regards,
James
