Subject: Re: Radiator, serviceable?

&gt; How's about taking out your old radiator, going to a junkyard and saying
&gt; &quot;gimme one like this with a radiator cap pls&quot;.  You might get lucky enough
&gt; to find an alternative Nor Amer. brand radiator that would work, plus
&gt; eliminates the bleeding/fill problems totally.  Then buy a new one for 1/3
&gt; of VWs cost. Long shot, but the rest of us would like to know :) I was
&gt; amazed at the amount of aluminium coloured crud/water that came out of mine
&gt; when I flushed it with Prestone, it must be getting thin in places.  bye, tim

There is a guy down around Pax River MD who installs 4.3 V6's in 
Vanagons, predominantly in air cooled van's not that it would matter. 
 He uses a GM radiator that fits wonderfully in the front just like 
we would want, and in fact mounts the siphon bottle up there as well. 
 I have no idea what radiator he uses, he cuts out and mounts a lower 
grille if doing it on an air cooled conversion.  He uses factory VW 
pipes or 1.25&quot; copper for the coolant if the factory pipes are not 
obtainable off a junker.
