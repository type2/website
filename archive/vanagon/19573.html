&gt; 	My brother and I were talking about going to one of the 
&gt; &quot;Drive your own car&quot; driving schools with my pickup and his
&gt; Vanagon :^) Heck, they're rear wheel drive, and the Vanagon has
&gt; more HP than my 914 did! Anyone know what SCCA class a 70 pickup
&gt; with stock, single-port 1600, would be in? Or do they only classify
&gt; certain models? 

Those driving schools are lots of fun.  Though I don't think anyone would want
to be behind you too long.  Just bring some fresh tires when you are finished.
The only classification your truck would be is in SCCA Solo II.  There it
would probably be in E or H Stock.  I do know that all stock air-cooled vws
and others NOC (not otherwise classed) are in H Stock.  That also goes
for Vanagons.  I have seen fast bugs run in the D Prepared class.  Club racing
does not allow trucks unless there is a truck class I don't know about.
I know they did have racing truck series a few years ago.    
 
&gt; 	The other wonderful idea along these lines would be to
&gt; find a drag strip and go on 'grudge' night- match-race vans, for
&gt; the slowest 1/4 miles they'd ever have recorded!

I always wanted to do that with our Vanagon just to see how fast (or slow)
it is but never got around to doing that.
