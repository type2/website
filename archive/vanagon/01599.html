Subject: Re: cv-joints: Constant Velocity Marihuana?




I don't know what it is about cv joints, but when I hear
them starting to knock, my stomach twists and I become
awfully crabby.  There only bits o' metal but they have
a powerful effect on my pysche.

When I told this to my new trusty mechanic, (new since my
conversion to watercooling and electronic brains in cars),
he blithely told me that he flips axles end for end on his
own cars when he hears that dreaded knocking, to get some extra
miles out of the joint before it totally fails.  Extra, as in
thousands!

He says, &quot;whats the worst that can happen? The joint breaks,
you replace it, thats all&quot;

Anyway, I think it is something to keep in mind if you ever are on
a long trip, WITH NO SPARE JOINT ON BOARD!
