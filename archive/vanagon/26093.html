Subject: RE: ALL NEW WASSERBOXER HEAD INFO

John,

Yes, I would like to see more of the info the engineer used to
get a new engine from VWoA. My '86 Westy has 133K miles on it. 
The engine does drip some, not so much now that I've put 
Bars Leaks into the coolant system. But if I could get a new 
engine, that would be great! Even new heads would be nice.

Thanks,
John Sharpe
