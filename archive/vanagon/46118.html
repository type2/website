Subject: RE: $500 '66 Carcass FS in NorCal

I finally checked out the bus last Wednesday, but haven't been able to get to my
e-mail till today.  This gem is owned by the founding member of the Bay Area
Transporter Association, a local chapter of NEATO.  He owns a fully restored 57
Micro and a nearly showroom perfect, unrestored '57 Deluxe (I thought I had died
and gone to VW heaven when he opened his garage).  

As for the carcass, this guy bought the bus from the previous owner to save it
from the scrap heap, but hasn't had the time to put it together himself.  The
bus is a '66 Micro and has been stripped down and primered getting it ready for
the paint shop.  It has some surface rust, but no cancer except at the outboard
corners of the cab floor, inside the door (these appear to be remnants of some
welding), there is no rust in any of the door openings.  There is still original
paint on the underside and on the both the front and back floors, with just some
surface rust.  It is essentially ready for restoration.  All windows and running
gear are either installed or available, but it has no engine.  There is a little
slop in the steering.  He said he might have a back seat to throw in, and the
front seats were very thrashed.

He also has a '61 Double Cab Pickup daily driver FS.  

If I had a garage and the time, this jewel would be mine; since I have neither,
it will have to go to someone else.

Let me know if you need any more info,
terry
