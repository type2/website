&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; I need two cup holders for my '87 Vanagon.  These are the &quot;Flip-Flop&quot; square
&gt; version.   Any color is okay (blue if possible)  I know it is a small item
&gt; but I have kids and want to keep the interior as free as possible from spilt
&gt; drinks.  Think of me next time you go to the salvage yard.  TIA
&gt; 

I got my drink holders from and RV supply store.  Almost identical to the VW 
ones but $45.00 CAN cheaper!!  Yes, they are not cheap from VW.  I think I paid 
about $8.00 CAN a piece.  I mounted them in the back as well as on the 
passenger seat pedestal.  Just screws into the sheet metal.  Just make sure you 
have the drink holders closed if you have a habit of walking down the path 
between the seats, especially if you are clumsy or cramped from driving too 
long.  I hear they snap off quite nicely. Not that I am speaking from 
experience. :-)

Cheers
Tony
