Hi Listers!

Dave is still scheduled to fly into Kansas City tomorrow night to pick up 
a 65 Camper that I'm the middle man on.  The last report from Dave to the 
list was inappropriate engine behavior on the '65's single port.  Here's 
what the problems were:

  Valve adjustment needed attention
  The coil wires were criss-crossed
  Condensor &amp; points were shot (vacuum advance is fine though)
  The brass snubbers on the spark plugs were not utilized as the spark 
     plug wires needed them causing timing wierdness
  '65 only wiper motor is nowhere to be found and the 66 wiper motor
     that came with it will not easily fit
  One kingpin needs attention
  Wiring is minimal (lights etc. are not hooked up)

*None of these things seemed to bother Dave.  We'll spend Thursday 
getting things together for his trip back to Atlanta

Good things:
  
  Compression is 130 130 130 136
  All new door seals (yet to be installed)
  Incredible rust-free California body freshly painted with pale yellow
    primer/sealer
  Restored side slat camper windows with new safety glass.
  New Brakes
  Has new uninstalled WCM wiring harness
  Has *new* wiper arms and blades

Stay tuned...
