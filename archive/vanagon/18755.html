Subject: JUDDER AND SMOKE [2]


    Hi all,
            
            Thanks to everybody for their help and suggestions with 
the judder on my 71 and the smoke from the heater vents. I've had a 
quick look around the engine as suggested and there appears to be no 
oil leaks about and no oil on the heater boxes. I will check the 
valve clearances and the engine mountings at the weekend. However I 
guess the judder is due to the clutch. we've been getting slight 
juddering as the clutch is engaged in 1st since getting the van, 
however it was only serious (and smoking) when setting off up hill. I 
suppose the smnoke could have been the clutch burning because it did 
smell bad like Stuart said. I will check everything out at the 
weekend and let you know how I get on. Thanks again for all the help.

                            Cheers
                                    Jon
