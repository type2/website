Sorry this is not VW related but I did put [f] in the 
subject line.

ANYWAY!!!!  I said that the Chargers wouldn't even have
a chance to when the AFC play game and they did.  What
kinda voodoo magic do you do David?  ;)

And......

Niners are going to kick the Chargers butts all over
the field on Jan. 29th..    :[ ]   

DAVID SCHARZE CAN YOU HEAR ME!!!?

Your probably still hung over from all the partying from
the night before.  Oh well.  Enjoy while you can....


GO NINERS!!!!!!
