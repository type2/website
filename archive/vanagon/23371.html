Subject: Re: Driver's Side Barndoor &gt;&gt; really Double Door

&gt;&gt;&gt;Joe Fournier say's he's spotted a van with a Barndoor on the driver's side
&gt;&gt;&gt;and asks how rare it is...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;First off &quot;barndoor&quot; is a specialized term which refers to pre-56(?)
&gt;
&gt;actually to be a really picky, barndoors were pre' March 1955 :)

Otay, I guess it's not a &quot;barndoor&quot; after all. I stopped by this morning
and looked again; two sets of doors...making it a &quot;double door?&quot; I still
left the owner a note asking if he was interested in selling it. 8-)

It's not in great shape, but I'm not shy of tackling more than I can do.
That's how I've achieved all by best accomplishments! It looks like it must
have helped keep a tree from falling all the way to the ground (a dent in
the roof, partly banged out) and it's got a little rust eating through the
fenderwells. It *seems* repairable, but I haven't really gotten a good
look-over. If it's running and repairable, what could I *guess* it's
worth...I know it really depends on what's wrong with it, right? Well,
maybe the question is, what would *you* pay for one of these if you had to
&gt;&gt;really&lt;&lt; work to get it back into shape?

Odds are that the guy has just recently bought it anyway. I noticed it had
no tags on it, which isn't all that uncommon in AR, but only legal for
about 10 days after purchase.

Thanks! Joe
