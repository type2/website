Hi,
	I posted about this once but I think it might have not made it
out because of the problems the list has had.  I just wanted to let the
list know that I have set up an FTP server at my mac, bolo.nosc_dot_mil.  It
contains some pictures I scanned in yesterday, and I'll keep it going until
someone makes me shut it down.  Log in with username &quot;ftp&quot; and type in 
your e-mail address as your password.  All files are binary so be sure and
type &quot;bin&quot; before transferring them.

Here are the descriptions:

/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/cab_1.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/cab_2.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/dash.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/engine_1.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/engine_2.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/engine_3.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/front.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/interior.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/side.tiff
/ftp/tiff/vw/brazilian/whole_van.tiff
	
	10 tiffs of a really unique type II, courtesy of Dave Black (thanks
	Dave!)

/ftp/tiff/vw/daboat/snow.tiff

	A picture of my camper in the snow, taken only 60 miles from
	San Diego (and you thought we didn't have weather here!)

/ftp/tiff/other/grand.tiff

	The grand piano that I tow behind my bus on occasion.  :)

/ftp/tiff/other/yosemite/ghost.tiff
/ftp/tiff/other/yosemite/mine.tiff

	Three pics taken in Yosemite at the Tioga mine site and ghost town.
	This is a planned stop on the big trip, if nobody objects...

/ftp/tiff/other/yosemite/mono.tiff

	Mono lake, shot from the junction of the Tioga road and highway
	395 near the Yosemite park entrance.

/ftp/tiff/other/mojave/desert_1.tiff

	Picture of an abandoned 40's vintage truck in the mojave desert.
	I had scanned other nice desert pictures but lost the rest of them
	due to a disk crash.  :(

Enjoy!

	-David
