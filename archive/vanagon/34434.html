SPINDLER CALLS IN AIR STRIKE, DESTROYS APPLE TO SAVE IT
     
Stock Price Increases 50%
     
&quot;We'll do it better,&quot; Says Microsoft
     
CUPERTINO, Calif. ------- JANUARY 18, 1996 ------
The massive pile of smoking rubble near Interstate 280 here in Cupertino 
was not the result of an earthquake or natural gas explosion, as 
officials first believed.
     
It now appears that the terrific explosion and fire at Apple Computer 
headquarters was the result of the first corporate-initiated airstrike 
on U.S. or California soil in U.S. history.
     
Sources within Apple have told newspapers that, in an effort to save 
Apple from an internal coup that would result in the breakup and sale of 
the company, embattled Apple CEO Michael Spindler called in elements of 
the California Air National Guard, based at Moffet Federal Air Station 
in  Mountain View, Calif. to bomb and strafe his own headquarters.
     
Spindler allegedly called the California Air National Guard late last 
night and ordered the airstrike, using an Apple Macintosh Quadra A/V 
with experimental sound cards to simulate the voice of California 
Governor Pete Wilson.
     
Within Apple, Spindler is seen as a hero. &quot;Cool! He called in an 
airstrike on his own position to save his company,&quot; said one internal 
Apple  applications developer, who gave his name as &quot;Scooter.&quot; &quot;It was 
like one of those  cool movies about, like, you know, Viet Nam, that I 
read about it on the Web, dude.&quot;
     
A memo to key staffers, reportedly written by Spindler himself, 
explained the need for the sir strike to counter moves by Apple managers 
and board  members to oust him in a corporate coup and to simultaneously 
increase the  company's marginal revenue. &quot;Existing Macintoshes, both 
those in use and those in warehouses, will instantly become collector's 
items and therefore  increase dramatically in value,&quot; according to the 
memo, which went on to explain  that &quot;this action will therefore 
increase our margins on existing stock with  no cost to our sales and 
manufacturing operations.&quot; Spindler, said to be  ailing, is in 
seclusion. Attempts to reach him by phone mail and fax were 
unsuccessful.
     
Apple stock shot up 50% on the news, as Wall Street apparently agreed 
with Spindler's strategy. &quot;Blowing up his own headquarters was a stroke 
of  genius,&quot; said one Wall Street analyst. &quot;This is the kind of pure 
creative, self-destructive genius we used to see when Steve Jobs was at 
Apple.  It's like the old days. Mac is back!&quot; Overall, computer stock 
stocks rose  75% as a result of the Apple news, then plunged 80% later 
in the day on rumors  that Dan Dorfman had been seen having lunch with 
Jim Clark and Marc Andreeson.
     
The Spindler airstrike memo, obtained via Internet e-mail by this 
reporter, was fragmented and missing key information. Apparently, the 
strike was planned for January 1, but key aides to Spindler did not 
receive the  e-mail until yesterday due to routing table buffer problems 
and addressing  errors.
     
Cupertino city officials issued a statement at 10:00 PST this morning 
calling the air strike &quot;an unfortunate incident that, while we hope we 
will all  gain something from it, we hope it did not offend anyone of 
any race, creed,  color, religion, thought process or emotional state, 
and we must emphasize that  the City of Cupertino had no role in this 
incident if it did.&quot; Class-action lawsuits against Apple and the city, 
alleging emotional trauma resulting  in a lost train of thought, loss of 
computing resources and interrupted  Internet access have already been 
filed in California State Court.
     
Later, when told by federal officials that the city will qualify for 
both federal disaster relief funds and labor department funds for 
unemployment and job training programs as a result of the destruction, 
Mayor Bob Mellow  said, &quot;Cool. We applaud Apple and Mike Spindler for 
having the vision and  courage to take this decisive action, and hope 
that our earlier statement was  taken in the spirit in which it was 
meant.&quot;
     
In Redmond, Wash., Microsoft announced plans to build and detonate 
several networked low-yield nuclear devices at its own headquarters some 
time in  1997. &quot;This is a project we already had underway,&quot; said a 
spokeswoman for  Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. &quot;We just decided that 
the marketplace won't be  ready for it until 1997. Or 1998, if we
decide that's when we really want to do  it. Or maybe later. Right now, 
we're hiring additional staff, developing new technology and getting 
ready to copy Apple's idea, strategy and  execution.  Oops, I meant to 
say that we're evaluating previously extant competitive actions.&quot; The 
project, dubbed Curtains `97, is expected by analysts to be complete 
some time in 1999.
     
Apple announced it will sue Microsoft in federal court over the &quot;look 
and feel&quot; of the use of explosive devices in business and home computing 
product strategies.
