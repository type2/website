Subject: Re: Electrical Cover

Raul writes...

&gt; To the point..the 1982 Westfalia is in need of an electrical cover, that
&gt; is, the cover that goes on the outside of the van where the water hookups
&gt; are located. VW wants $25 for the thing with the hinge pin. The color is
&gt; black with the graphics in white.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of a source that has them cheaper? Or, does anyone has one
&gt; that wouldn't mind selling? I was told that Bus Boys would have parts for
&gt; the Vanagons. I requested a catalog three months ago. I don't think they'll
&gt; be sending one. Either way, help in this matter is appreciated.

If you can get the cover for $25, go for it.  BusBoyz wants $51.  I paid 
Euro-American (Delta-6) $32.50 for a black electrical cover for my 81 
Westy.
