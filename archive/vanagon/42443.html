Hello everybody! (&quot;Hello, Dr. Nick!!&quot; :-) )

Since I'm no longer on the list and out of touch, I'm not sure how many
people plan to show up next weekend. Maria and I will probably be there
Saturday only because of baby and work. Anyway, here's a repost of the
flyer. Feel free to let me know if you're coming so I can give you a
cell-phone #, just for the case you get lost and need directions. Or, if
enough people are interested, we could meet in town and have pizza on
Friday night, like we did a year ago. Either way, don't forget to adorn
your busses with the vanagon list sticker :)  Hope to see you there!

Busses by the Arch
1514 Wild Goose Run
St. Charles, MO 63303

BBTA #10: O'Fallon, Missouri, May 24, 25, &amp; 26, 1996.

Come join us for the upcoming &quot;BUSSES BY THE ARCH&quot; camping weekend
sponsored by NEATO &amp; LIMBO. This family camping event will feature a
gathering of Volkswagen Transporters of all types and eras from all over
the U.S.A. We are looking forward to seeing both you and your type II
amidst all the &quot;Split-windows&quot;, &quot;Bubble-windows&quot;, Vanagons, Eurovans and
other VW's this spring! 

&quot;BUSSES BY THE ARCH 10&quot; will be held rain or shine Friday thru Sunday, May
24, 25, and 26, 1996 at a new location! The city of O'Fallon has
permanently closed the campground at our previous event site in Fort
Zumwalt City Park. This privately run facility is located on Hwy. 79 seven
miles off Interstate 70 and is about 35 miles west of downtown St. Louis
and the Gateway Arch. The area reserved for our event has both open,
grassy and shady, wooded camping areas. Most any convenience that you
might ever need is within 15 minutes of camp. You may even be able to get
dinner delivered to the campgrounds...

On both Friday and Saturday evenings we plan to have campfire activities,
volleyball, door prizes, parts swapping and VW videos in addition to the
&quot;site-to-site&quot; socializing and &quot;bus-banter&quot; that this NEATO/LIMBO event is
famous for. On Saturday morning we're planning another of our famous
scenic Bus caravans with a picnic stop. Yes, we plan to return to our very
popular &quot;Double River Crossing&quot; tour on the car ferrys. Perhaps we'll try
to break our previous record by stuffing a 23rd Bus onto the &quot;Golden Eagle
Ferry&quot; across the Mississippi River. You won't want to miss it! Saturday
night owners choice awards will be presented in several type II classes.
Sunday you're free to visit the Gateway Arch, Historic Old St. Charles,
the riverboat casino, or many other regional highlights. It should prove
to be a relaxed, fun weekend full of great Volkswagen experiences and new
friendships. 

The camping facilities at Cherokee Lakes feature our own, large private
&quot;Busses by the Arch&quot; group area with a limited number of electric hook-ups
(first come, first served), tweo stocked lakes for fishing (no permits
needed, $4fee), a 30'x16' swimming pool, laundry, firewood,
gas/convenience store, and double the toilet and hot shower facilities
(new, clean and air conditioned!). There will be a Busses by the Arch
event fee of $8 per VW for the whole weekend, and *in addition* the
campground has offered us a VW group campsite rate of $10 per night per
vehicle (down from $15). Only registered VW's that are camping will be
admitted into the BBTA group area! Campsites in the BBA group area can't
be reserved in advance. Site selection is on a &quot;first come, first served&quot;
basis. Although there's plenty of room, the earlier you arrive the better. 

We're looking forward to your arrival for a full holiday weekend of Volkswagen
fun. Please pass the word around to your VW friends about our NEATO/LIMBO
event. Then wipe down and pack up those Transporters for the cruise to St.
Louis for the &quot;BUSSES BY THE ARCH 10&quot; campout on May 24, 25, and 26, 1996
in O'Fallon, Missouri.
