Subject: Re: Can I replace my back seats of 84 van with newer seats?  

&gt;I too have a 84 Vanagon GL and want the weekender setup. I believe that the
&gt;weekender will
&gt;fit (let me know if you hear differently)
&gt;Go Aftermarket: Z-Products says they have a conversion kit to turn
&gt;a normal back bench into a weekender style seat. I asked them to send me
&gt;some information on it.  The kits costs $250.00 and they said you'll 
&gt;need power tools and a good mechanical sense.

Here is an opportunity to tell a little more about my vanagon acquisition
and my girlfriend's (such a silly word) vanagon acquisition.  I bought my
vanagon (1985, immaculate GL, 71k) for $2800 it had a broken side window, a
cracked front window, and the transmission was leaking (the seal between the
tranny and the final drive box)  Well, i took it on &quot;tour&quot; with Phish (for
two days, Raliegh, NC, and Gainesville, VA) with my girlfriend and another
friend.  Like I said the transmission was leaking bad and I was very
unfamiliar with this vehicle, i had just bought it.  Even though i was
worried about making this 600 mile trip, everything went well.  We all slept
in the van at a north carolina rest stop with a bunch of other Phishheads
(overnight stays there were illegal, but the DMV cop was a nice guy).  All
the while, my girlfriend is telling me how she is possibly getting a 1985
vanagon GL also, and if she does, it will be at her house when we return.
Well, we get home and sure enough, a white vanagon is sitting in front of
her house, BUT it had the bed and mine did not, JEALOUSY!  I looked at her
rear seat and noticed that it was exactly like mine and i got to thinking
that i had a bed too, (but i didn't have the extra mattress) so i went to my
van and sure enough, after a few tugs, out popped half of a bed, i ran
around her neighborhood like a crazy man for about 5 min.  Eventually i had
a mattress made at an uphostery shop ($80, and very nice) and its a nice
sleeper.

(Here's the part thats important)
I was under the delusion that i did not have a bed when i bought the van and
i called around looking for answers (with the help of joel) and i do believe
that your best bet would be to get an original VW seat, used, because that
kit one opens up LEVEL with the rear deck, and you will need a LARGE
mattress for that whole thing, not pretty.  Also expect to pay more than $80
for  that additional mattress, firm padding is not cheap, i got lucky, so
look into this before going all the way.
