Subject: WANT 0.77 4th for an 091

Subject says it all, in preparation for building an off-roading 
Baywindow I need a 0.77 4th set to go with the 5.43 R&amp;P I should be 
getting.  This ratio is a rare aftermarket thing perhaps made only by 
Transform in the 80's only.  Weddle and Transform run across them 
occasionally but not now.  Also sought is a 1.22 3rd, this was 
probably available as a VW gear but uncommon.

I really need something taller than the .82 4th available to cruise 
the highway at a reasonable rpm.  I'm seeking basically only a low 1 
and 2.

As another option anyone with a 4.86 R&amp;P for the 091 (rare as well) 
for say something under $300, talk to me.
