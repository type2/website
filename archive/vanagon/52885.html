&gt;        It's disappointing to hear you say that. When you are in need 
&gt;of a battery boost or are mired in the mud, I hope that when you 
&gt;make that plea for help, that the person coming to your aid does not
&gt;interrogate you first to ascertain if your values, conduct or lifestyle 
&gt;are offensive to the rescuer before he/she decides whether or not to 
&gt;throw you that tow line.
&gt;
&gt;        Here's a plea for help. Can't we just unconditionally help out?

I would generally agree with you in this regard, but I really do feel that
missionaries are for the most part practicing cultural genocide.  I
wouldn't expect someone to interrogate me, but then again, I would also not
flag someone down and tell them that I was spreading the Good News about
David Koresh to the ignorant savages.
