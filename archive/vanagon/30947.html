I guess its gotten tothe point where I should just mail these questions
to The Bob! :)

Anyway, I noticed that my brand new tires (since August?) are showing
their wear pattern.  Normally I see tires wear more on the inside, but
mine are wearing on the outside, which would suggest a positive camber.

Anything a home wrench can do about this, or do I just head straight to
the alignment shop?

Prolly not a bad thing to get anyway, and alignment; it prolly hasn't been
aligned since sometime before it was last registered, which was '72!!
