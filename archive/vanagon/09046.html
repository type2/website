For what its worth, my wife's Renault 5 speedo has being doing exactly the
same thing for about 4 years now, but only in cold weather, the cure does
seem to be replacement not greasing. Thus far it has always come back
to work. Look on the bright side - think of all the mileage you are saving -- 
because the odometer doesn't work either.

OTOH - a wonky speedo (one that bounces around or can't hold a precise
speed) usually can be fixed however with a little greasing of the cable
and input shaft- DC
