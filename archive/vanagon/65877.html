Subject:        Re: Tires for Syncro ?

Budd:

You'll get a lot of good advise on what tires to buy....so here's my two
cents worth. I haven't seen the Yokohama and can't comment on those. I
have had very good experience with Michelin XZX reinforced, 205/70/R14.
this is not an off road tire. I use these on my 90 Carat and get 50K
miles. On the 86 Syncro, I am presently using Firestone FR480 215/70/R14.
This is the tire Ford uses as OEM on their Explorers. I mention this only
because it makes it a popular tire and fairly cheap.  I have only put
3000 miles on them, so can't say how long they will last. So far their
performance has been good.

I do recommend that you do not buy a tire smaller than 205/70/R14.
