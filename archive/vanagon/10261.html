Subject: Non OEM VW Exhaust

I recently had to replace the muffler on my 1987 Syncro. Not too bad considering
the muffler is over 7 years old.  However, when i began pricing new mufflers,
the new stainless steel ones are over $300.00, and this is the price for after
market.  However, I was able to locate a muffler (German) for approximately
$170.00.  Not great but better than 300.00.  The problem is the diameter of the
new muffler is smaller then the OEM muffler and the straps that wrap over it to
secure it dont't have enough play to tighten them enough.  The parts supplier
said it would fit, but i think it's a generic muffler that will fit all years of
vanagons (water cooled) ie: 1984 and on..  I was wondering if I could by the
staps used in earlier vanagons and adapt them for my 1987.  Does anyone have any
suggestions or part number for the earlier straps?  If that doesn't work, i may
find a way to shorten the ones i have.
