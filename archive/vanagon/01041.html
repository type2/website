 &gt; I just got an 84 vanagon.  I need a repair manual.  The official

 &gt; one for the vanagon?

If you are willing to receive catalogs for the rest of your life (and perhaps
after) you can order the official VW manual for the vanagon from J.C. Whitney
for $64.99 plus shipping, etc.  That is where I got mine.  It is worth it.
