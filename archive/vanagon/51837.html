Subject: Oil drain screw diameter, 


Does anyone know the diameter of the oil drain plug on an '85 1.9 l?

The Bentley that I stole from Mike Escaravage tells me the torque spec but
not the actual size and I don't want to remove it until I have another.
 &lt;Just kidding Mike, You'll get the Bentley back...  by 2001&gt;

TIA


Cheers.
