It sounds like this is the same tape I picked up at Home Depot not too
long ago.  Its name is &quot;Magic Wrap&quot;,  and it claims it &quot;FORMS A SOLID
RUBBER WRAP!&quot;  Also says it's a &quot;Multi-purpose rubber repair kit in a
roll.&quot;  It sounds like the same stuff described in the various posts.

Comes in a roll 1&quot; x 16'.  Made by Glosgow Manufacturing, London, Canada
