Subject: Bucking '83 Vanagon 42-47mph

I have an '83 that hesitates and bucks between 35-50 mph. This occurs
especially around 42-47 mph. The van runs great above and below these speed
ranges. I really don't know what to expect from good old FI systems. I am
new to Vanagons but used to most of the older VWs. The feeling I get is that
I need to &quot;clean out the tank and change the fuel filter and fuel pump.
Truly I think it appears to be related to the injection some how. 

Does this problem mirror the problem mentioned in the &quot;cheap fix&quot; posts?

Notes: Recent though tune-up (not though enuf eh!), changed fuel filter, all
gas line/seals/grommets as in the runeth over posts.
