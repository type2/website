&gt;         We were thrilled! Our monster roared again and again, but each time 
&gt; the top candle tilted a bit more vertically. After about 4 balls the candle 
&gt; pointed into the balloon and the next shot was fatal.  By this time the 
&gt; ballon had arrived over the housing site, and it abruptly descended like 
&gt; some demon, spewing fire and thunder.  We watched in awe as it dropped 
&gt; behind the roof of the houses, bright flashes lit up the rooflines, lights 
&gt; came one all over the place, we heard a scream. Great coils of fireworks 
&gt; smoke rolled up to the roofs from inside the parking area, adding even more 
&gt; to colourful ambience of the evening. Truly a 'Son et Lumiere' to remember, 
&gt; for us and the occupants.

	So that was you!!!:-)

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!
