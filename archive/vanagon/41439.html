Subject: re: deep cycle battery


&gt;Stinger dry cell Power Master  (Model SPB-1000)
&gt;     True Deep-cycle battery
&gt;     Withstands more than 400 cycles of 100% discharge
&gt;It looks very good.  For
&gt;more information, call Stinger Electronics at
&gt;800.477.2267.&lt;
&gt;
&gt;he forgot to mention the price - $240.


I keep seeing in the paper, ads for marine batteries. Aren't these
deep-cycle types, used for electric trolling motors etc.? Why wouldn't
they work as auxiliary batteries in Westies, to power the stereo,
lights, fridge etc. when stopped? My FALPS even has them, at prices
comparable to auto starting batteries (under $100).
