&gt; &gt; Hi Everyone!,
&gt; &gt; My Alternator/BAttery led indicator seems to be coming on ( slight dim)
&gt; &gt; not as bright as the LED on the right of my 84 GL. Changing the load
&gt; &gt; e.g switching on high beam, AC , etc does not seem to change the
&gt; &gt; brightness. I am suspecting a short or a defective voltage regulator.
&gt; &gt; Anybody have any ideas whats happening ? Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Voltage regulator is a definite possibility.  Does the OXS light come on too?
&gt; It's easy to replace.  Two screws and plug the new one in.

   Unfortunately new voltage regulator did not eliminate problem.
One thing the Ground cable on the battery terminal felt quite warm
indicating some heavy load somewhere. There may be a short 
somewhere. I am going to check the connection at the starter  terminal and
ground straps just to make sure there are no I squared R at these points.
Any tips from folks reading is greatly welcome. HAte  to think I may
need a new alternator.
