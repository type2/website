Subject: need comments on '81 Westy

Hi, all
I'm a Vanagon newbie, having just found this list off of the newsgroup. 
Hopefully I'm subscribed now :)
I'm looking at an '81 Westfalia, with 57,xxx miles, in excellent shape, 
for around $4300. I've already read that it is underpowered - I can 
probably deal with that. This one has a booster heater that the original 
owner didn't know about, and which doesn't seem to be working. Are they 
any good? It also has air conditioning, which really is a must here in 
Arkansas. Does the air in these actually keep them cool, and can I expect 
it to still cruise at highway speeds with it on? Also, how is the engine 
cooling on these? Can I expect overheating problems in 100 degree weather?

Lastly, does anyone have any thoughts on mounting Yakima racks on a 
Westfalia? It looks like I can either get tower extensions and use the 
gutters, or buy &quot;fake gutter&quot; brackets to bolt to the top. Thoughts?

If you'd cc a copy directly to me at malcolm_at_cast.uark_dot_edu, I'll be sure 
to get it :) Many thanks,
