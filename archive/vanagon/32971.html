Subject: re: 6V Starter --&gt; 12V battery?

        I converted my '65 to 12 v. in 1974, and used the 6 v. starter for
years without a problem.  The major difference was the speed at which the
motor turned over -- much faster!! I kept the engine well tuned, and it
nearly always started immediately. For items that required 6v power, like
the fuel gauge (I think) I used a voltage reducer (probably not the correct
name, but I don't remember now). I changed all of the light bulbs, etc to 12
v., and installed a really neat alternator kit that had its own replacement
for the stock generator pedastal so that the fan shaft would still line up.
I also did a change to a mechanical advance distributor at this time, which
helped with starting and performance and included 12 v. tune-up parts. The
whole change over took less than a weekend, and I got many many thousands of
trouble-free driving out of the system.
        At the time the opinions I received from experienced independent VW
mechanics about the use of 12 v. current in 6 v. motors included a
discussion of the heavier windings and armature size in the typical 6 v.
motor.  The thinking was that they could take a lot of abuse before giving
out under the stress imposed by the 12 v. current.  I'm pretty sure that I
ran my wipers this way for quite a while. They ran faster, but I don't
remeber the motor giving out very soon after the change-over.  I am,
however, sure that I did later change the wiper motor, starter and flywheel
over to the 12 v. equivalents.
        Anyway, the starter life is certainly reduced by the use of 12 v.
power, but the shorter periods of use due to the increase in cranking speed
and quicker starting are, in my opinion, just about a wash (and certainly
cheaper than the starter and flywheel job).

        Now I drive an '81 Vanagon, but I miss that old '65. Good luck with
yours.
