No, you have to logg off and, I think, even go back to DOS, and then run
their custom software from there and let their software dial in. Expensive
and of questionable value since most of this infomation is already on the
gopher and they make it impossible to save the stuff to your hard disk but
force you to do a print out onto your printer on the spot.

There is *some* neat stuff, but I think Gerry's gopher's got the gold.

&gt;Does anyone know how to access the Alldata Corp. database on vehicle tech 
&gt;service bullitins and repair proceedures.  I got the web address from this
list 
&gt;but all I can get is an account number that is supposed to be good for 10 free 
&gt;minutes of access.  There doesn't seem to be anyway to get to the database so 
&gt;that you can use the account number from the web server.  Do you use FTP,
Gopher 
&gt;or Netscape to get at this?  I am starting to suspect that this is a flim-flam 
&gt;site designed to suck in credit card numbers (which is why I'm not going
repeat 
&gt;the site address that I already have).
