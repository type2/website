Subject: how about a v-6

     Well folks I can't stand the darn bus being parked anymore.  I have a
'72 Sportmobile camper that don't go no more.  I hate to admit it but it's
been parked almost a year now.  I know I know :(   So anyway,  I bought a
rebuilt engine for it from ATK (never again, I'd do it myself) and about
1000 miles later on a trip ti Mississippi it slowed down, stopped, and
wouldn't restart.  I haven't looked to far it was easier (physically) to let
it sit.  It seems to have a lot of blowby and no change at idle when I
remove #3 plug wire.  I'm guessing hole in piston or broken ring.  At any
rate I just picked up a Buick 231 c.i. V6 for nuthing.  Has anybody had any
experience with a horsepower monster like that in a bus?  Kennedy list the
adapter and flywheel and I've got a torch,welder,and lots of assorted
knuckle busters.  The fitting of it doesn't bother me to much but my main
reason for going to water-cooled is the reliability (read, leave the motor
in for 100,000 miles at a time).  Any ideas, suggestions, magic lamps to
loan??  Thanks,
                                        Doug
