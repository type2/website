&gt; Well, there are a multitude of things: 1) what is the CR? 

Not sure, but it is low.  The pistons I bought were dished.

&gt; 							    2) even new parts 
&gt; are sometimes are not going to work right.  I got 4 rebuilt rods for my last 
&gt; rebuild, and not a one was even close to straight.  I think that bend rods 
&gt; are a real bad thing to have.  

I'm confident that my rods are okay, cause my friend at the machine shop
spent a lot of time making sure they weighed exactly the same, and were
straight.  Not sure about all of the other parts, though.

Thanks for the comments...
