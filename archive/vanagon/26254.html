&gt;&quot;They&quot; said:
&gt;Volkswagen's line of com[act vans, which gained 4-wheel-drive models last
&gt;year, get one major change this year.  Vanagon GL models will gain a second
&gt;sliding door, this one on the driver's side of the vehicle.  This is the
&gt;first van sold in the U.S. with that feature.......
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone ever seen an '87 or any other year of Vanagon with this?  I never
&gt;have.  If this did make to these shores, it makes me wonder why Chrysler is
&gt;making such a big deal about their double sliding door vans for '96 when VW
&gt;had it 9 years before on the Vanagon.  But what else can you expect from the
&gt;company that claims they invented the mini-van?

cause it was a screw-up by CR. vw has offered an optional special-order 2nd
sliding door since 1966 (when the first sliding door option was offered).
when i got my 1971 bus, i almost ordered one with the 2nd sliding door, but
it was a $600 option and i was told i'd have to wait six months for the
bus to be shipped. i didn't want to wait, so i skipped it. :(
