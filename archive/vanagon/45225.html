  Ok, here's another trick.  A clever friend had pranks insert a spongy 
red rubber ball into his fuel tank years ago.  It kept disintegrating and 
fowling the fuel filter.  So after the obvious draing and removal 
attemps, he cut the fuel line and inserted two big universal filters in 
series, keeping a spare in the vehicle.  Every time the first filter 
would plug, he'd replace it in line with the second and replace the 
second with the spare and replace the spare.  This went on for a while 
and every time the second filter was getting red junk that some how made 
it through the first, but never did he have to pull the carb or injectors 
whatever that vehicle was using.  Soon the junk was gone.
  Use it os not as you see fit, but it works.
