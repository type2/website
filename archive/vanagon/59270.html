Subject: Problem w/ power window switch on '91 Vanagon

Thanks to those that provided me with the instructions on how to take the
motor out of the door (and to Bentley). I did, unfroze it with a few turns
and put it back in. Now I have the following situation. The motor runs fine
and at normal speed, but when conected to the switch, it only operates one
way (down). In order to bring it up, I must reverse the contacts by unpluging
an pluging the conection backwards, pressing the switch and that will raise
the window. Obviously that is not convinient but makes me believe that the
problem is not the motor but the switch. Any one with experience with this
switches ? Are they repairable or do they need to be replaced ? The fact is,
both left and right switches were replaced recently with used ones from a
junkyard, before the motor was running, and I did not know if they were
working when I got them. The original ones are the ones that cause the
problem in the first place but I could never fix them.

Thank you for any help !
