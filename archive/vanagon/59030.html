&gt;  I have just replaced the heads, water pump, thermostat, belts, clutch, 
&gt;  pressure plate, release bearing, and pilot bearing, flushed the cooling 
&gt;  system, and taken a good look at anything that I have touched in the 
&gt;  process.  I have also inspected the brakes for wear and leaks, and will 
&gt;  buy new tires before the trip.  The PO repacked the wheel bearings and 
&gt;  replaced the fuel pump within the last two years, or so.
&gt;  

Didn't hear the oil, plugs, filters, cap/rotor, etc...but I assume with all
the work above, you did these.  I would recommend a wheel alignement when you
get the new tires.  How about checking the CVs?  Bring a good toolkit.  Good
luck.
