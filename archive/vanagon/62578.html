Subject: Vanagon Speedometers - Random Thoughts

Understand as you read this that I have never owned a vanagon, and
this is strictly me maundering to the list(s), but....

On my recent cross country trip I visited one list member who had
installed (with very minor modification) a vanagon speedo in his breadloaf
bus to get a trip odometer.  

Two thoughts occur to me as a result: 

o first, that the reverse should also be possible, if a 'loaf will accept
  a v'gon speedo, then a v'gon should be able to accept the (much cheaper) 
  'loaf speedo;

o second, that I have never heard complaints from breadloaf owners about
  this broken gear problem.  Further on the second thought, it may well be
  that the plastic gear in the v'gon speedo is an &quot;upgrade&quot; to a look (and
  fit) alike metal gear (or worm &amp; gear set) in the loaf-era speedo.  

As I said, this all just random thoughts, I ain't never done this, and, if
it works, I know I am screwing myself for used speedos for my 'loafs, but
has anyone looked into this????
