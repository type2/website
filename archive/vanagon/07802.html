Subject: Re: I humbly beg forgiveness. (hah!)  

Speaking of trespassing on peoples toes, a note posted in the porsche group 
indicated that a member had received a lawyers letter &lt;wipe... flush&gt; 
because he had badmouthed (on the list) a repair shop that did a poor job on 
a pre-buying inspection. It was a cease and desist or else letter. Since we 
are a 'private club' with eligibility criteria for membership (dubious ones 
I admit) aren't we immune from this crap. How does The Lemon Aid book or 
Consumers Report get away with badmouthing name brand products publicly when 
we, 'privately', on the net are in danger?  The smell of some lawyers is 
beginning to taint the internet.
