Subject:  Throttle or Cruise Control for 84 Vanagon -Reply



&gt;&gt;&gt; Steffen Layer &lt;slayer95_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt; 02/18/96 04:20pm &gt;&gt;&gt;
Now that my vanagons head gaskets are fixed I plan to take it for a  test
drive from Michigan to California. Unfortunately, I do not have a  cruise
control. 

Do you have tips how to add... 

a) a mechanic throttle? (I already tried a brick)  b) an electronic cruise
control? If so, where could I buy one?

Thanks!

My cruise control is more commonly referred to as my &quot;right foot&quot;

:) :)
