Subject: Re: My dream bus...or bus dream...

&gt;I'm dreaming about old buses now, isn't that odd?  
&gt;
&gt;Last night I dreamed I was pursuing a '69 red van in MINT condition -- it 
&gt;kept slipping away down alleys, the wrong way, and I couldn't get near 
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;Then the owner painted the whole thing, windshield, windows and all, 
&gt;battleship grey to throw me off.
&gt;
&gt;I think I have bus lust.  Is there something to do about it???

This sounds like busaholism.
