FYI&gt;&gt;&gt;you already have half of this switch!if you turn on the A/C the low
speed fan function SHOULD be energized.If you don't want to load the
engine turn the A/C temp switch up so the compressor clutch is
disabled...If you need more cooling than this you have got serious
problems ,fix'em!don't band-aid 'em

Ken&quot;always looking for the simple solutions&quot; Lewis

&gt;  Recently there has been some talk of installing a manually operated

&gt;to bring on the coolant fan before the limit closes. I'd be interested 
&gt;in
&gt;hearing from anyone who may of done this . I'd like to know how and 
&gt;where you
&gt;mounted the switch , the routing of the wiring, switch type, etc.. I 
&gt;guess
&gt;basically the whole kit n kaboddle, if you like you can respond to me
&gt;directly or just post it on the list.
