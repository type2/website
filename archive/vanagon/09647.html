Subject: Re: Diesel to Gas conversion

Test drove a diesel to gas conversion while in CA. In principle it is not
a difficult process of swapping the diesel for an inline 4 cyl Rabbit
engine (this seems to be the best way to go). Unfortunately the one I saw
was a mess, did not start and a had faulty clutch take up which made
driving difficult. I believe soemthing called an &quot;idler&quot; later broke on
the poor soul who bought the thing. DC

&gt; &gt; A friend of mine is curious about converting a diesel Vanagon to gasoline
&gt; &gt; power. Hasn't somebody on the list done this? Is there some info in the
&gt; &gt; archives? Same friend is also curious about turbocharger kits for the diesel.
&gt; 
&gt; for anyone who is interested, i have a couple of magazine articles about this
&gt; and for the price of an email message (be sure to include your address and
&gt; zip code, boys and girls!), i'll mail you a copy of them.
&gt; 
&gt; as to the turbocharger, there was a fellow who wrote a couple of articles in
&gt; the VWCOA Autoist about doing just that ... he loved it, but it was a bit of
&gt; a headache for his mechanic, as the manufacturer of the kit hadn't really
&gt; intended it to be used on vw buses. he finally got it all sorted out, though.
&gt; what about the possibility of taking a turbo diesel engine from a jetta??
&gt; might it not fit?
