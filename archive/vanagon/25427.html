&gt; RVB:
&gt; There were a very disappointing few shots of VWs in the movie. Nice shots of
&gt; some creative combos e.g. Backward positioned roof section of a stupid
&gt; beetle placed on top of (welded/fiberglassed) a 72-ish westy. mid '50s
&gt; pickup on top of a mid '50s GMC/Superior Bus etc. No real expose' of deady
&gt; buses. A few roof top shots of parking lots and Arse end shots of '67-'68
&gt; westy with back up lights ala '67 with bubble rust coming through. some
&gt; quasi cool shots of home brewed paint jobs. Ken Kesey interview.(Snooze)
&gt; 
Hey! Watch for my bus! I was at the shows when they were filming last
year. Look for the rainbow '67 split with the smiley face on the front.
I'm hoping we made it in there. 
BTW, I know the guy that owns the &quot;poster bus&quot;. He was also the AP photo
for Woodstock last year. Nice guy, I talked to him at a lot of shows...
Just waiting until the film makes it to NC.
Richard
