Well, I just can't seem to find a decent Westfalia around here, and I can't
bring myself to part with the $$$ everyone around here wants for a
water-cooled model, so I'm about to do a final inspection on a 1980 camper.
Very clean. 93K total miles, 20K on rebuilt engine.

One interesting thing came up talking to it's mechanic:
re had to replace the right head in January - claimed that when they rebuilt it
they used &quot;Canadian&quot; heads which try to work without a gasket, and hadn't
been properly milled. He put a gasket under the left one, but had to
replace the right one entirely. Only other problem seems to be a
loose/corroded wire on the fuel injection box. Anyway, does this head story
sound reasonable, or did this mechanic perhaps take advantage of it's
owner?

We'll see what happens tomorrow... but if you see this before 10:30 AM PDT
let me know via email, and cc: my work account: rick.gordon_at_aldus_dot_com too.

Thanks in advance,
rick
