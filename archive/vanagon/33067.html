&gt;here is a good one although not inflicted on a v.w.  but a '74 ltd.
&gt;
&gt;one line heard before intense swearing while working near the
&gt;hole where the removed distributor uaually sits.
&gt;
&gt;    hey, whered that 1/4in. socket get off to?
&gt;
OK, after removing the AM radio from the dash of my '48 plymouth and
sending it in for repair on a high school student's allowance, with no
trouble found, I discovered the chrome spotlight resting against the
antenna.  Moved it. and trouble vanished.

Now, the VW content.  I found out the hard way that you can't advance the
distributor by feel in the 81 like you can in the 72.  Burnt up an already
weakened 2.0L powerplant in a relatively short time through that stupidity.
