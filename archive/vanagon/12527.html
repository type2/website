&gt;I never opened the VW anti-freeze but have heard from you all that its
&gt;blue.  Is it really noticeably blue?  This stuff looks very very green.
&gt;Did I get ripped off?  Could I be mistaken?  Thanks for any help.  Please
&gt;cc: me or e-mail direct.

it's POSSIBLE that the mechs simply didn't replace the coolant in the
expansion tank ... it's the only tank that has no drain, so if they got
busy doing something else while the coolant drained out of the car, it could
have been overlooked. that's happened to me.

the vw coolant is definitely blue. in my eyesight, anyway. problem is, we
have the male difficulty with distinguishing blue-green from teal (how many
of you fellows have had words with the little woman about what color
something is?) and male-pattern-color-blindness. :) but to me, it is blue.
no trace of yellow at all.

about the only way to tell is to get some out of a fresh bottle, and compare.
