Yes - In the early 80's I bought a water injection kit from Edelbrock.  It had
a control box that looked a vacum and rpm (via coil primary) and from that
used some sort of algorythm to determine when and how much water to spray. 
The water mist cools the incoming charge and effective &quot;raises&quot; the octane of
the mixture to reduce or delay ping.  It also  cleans carbon deposits pretty
effectively.   Since it contributed to reducing pre-ignition, you could
advance the timing to get better power and economy.   Don't know if they are
still avialable, I got mine at a speed shop.  With modern engine controls and
knock sensors, water injection is kinda put out of business, but it should
definitely help older carb fed engines.
