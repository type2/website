Subject: Re:  Rocker mouldings on Westy


&gt;Someone asked about mouldings on Westies. While mine does not have them, I
&gt;have seen at least two Westies around her (N.CA.) that have them.

	The guy that runs California Campers, has a '90 Westy with the 
	grey rocker moldings (added by a PO, apparently). I didn't look
	closely enough to see what changes were made on left side to
	accomodate the propane tank and mudflap.

	I've also seen one or two SyncroWestys with *black* rocker moldings
	a very distinctive looking vehicle!
