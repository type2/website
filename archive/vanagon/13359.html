So Joel Walker says:
&gt; on my current bus (no puns intended).
&gt; 
&gt; also white you are at it: a large wire (maybe 12 guage) from the battery
&gt; ground strap to the front of the bus, and there to each headlight ground wire
&gt; will give you less voltage drop ... and brighter headlights.
&gt; 

Why do you need brighter headlights?  If anything, they need to be dimmer.
I've gotten occassional flashing brights form others from day one. :[
And I know they're not miss-aligned.  Halogens just fool ya sometimes.
I've noticed that with other cars, even on sedan that are lower to the
ground.
