Subject: Re: what and where ... again. :)


Well, joel's geographical listing was briefly out of kilter as
Markus Kraus, his wife Jody and their 79 T2 Van spent the night
on my beach....after being unable to get a campground site
anywhere in Massachusetts (could it have anything to do
with this being the week of the 4th?).

I had to dutifully keep them awake with beers, VW books and the
infamous Golen collection of VW videos (the factory's histroy
film...the VW beetle experience...etc...)...

Yesterday, we piled in the 56 for a brief tour of the &quot;neighborhood&quot;,
then off we went in the EuroVan searching for a &quot;late 60s&quot; bug
they spotted about 5 miles from my house. The bug turned out to
be real trash....Markus said it looked good at night...I told
him it was sort of that &quot;halo&quot; effect that made members of the
opposite sex look good at night after many beers 8-)

They are now in NYC for the weekend, rendering Joel's list
somewhat again off-kilter (its always bizarre...).

If anyone on &quot;vanagon&quot; happens to drift by SE Mass/Cape Cod..
drop me a line...we have a nice camper space on the water!
