Oooooh, jeez, Steve, that's a pretty nice rig you've got...  Nope, no way 
you should drive it anywhere--better just give it to me.  ;)

I wouldn't worry about it, 'specially if you're going to stay on the 
Baja.  I personally wouldn't wash it before going down, but it's the big 
fancy-schmancy 30 foot RVs and greyhound bus conversions that draw 
attention to themselves.  Oh, yeah, and Linda might want to remove some 
of those diamonds she's always got draped all over her.
