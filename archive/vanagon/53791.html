&gt; They will also tell you that it can't be installed

I can confirm this.  Before buying Zemco units for my (and a friends) 87
Vanagons, I called Zemco and they confirmed that there was no problem.  I
spliced in a 15' or so cable to get from the &quot;smarts&quot; &amp; servo in the engine
compartment to the control switches for the driver.
