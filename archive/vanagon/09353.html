So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; OK,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I don't know if I really want to open this can 'o worms again, but now
&gt; that I have a _new_ motor in my bus (the only thing used is the crank)    
&gt; I wonder is a synthetic is a good or bad idea.  I also have the doghouse
&gt; cooling setup, for what its worth.  I'm also considering a deeper sump setup.
&gt; I am not considering a filter setup, though.
&gt; 

I wouldn't do it.  I spoke to a guy that worked at Victory Auto Parts and
he was a real fanatic about his Type II with Type IV engine.  He said that
he hated leaks and had his engine leak free until he used a synthetic oil.
Said it leaked like a sieve.  I'm sure the engine runs smoother, but I
hate oil leaks too and will not risk it.
