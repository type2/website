Subject: cheap longblocks S.D. area?

Hey all,

I have removed and stripped my 1641cc dp for my '71 campmobile.  Need to 
find a stock 1600 longblock with a warranty in the San Diego area.  Kline 
Automotive in Lakeside wants $350.00 after exch but only a 3k mile 
warranty if I put it in myself. Oh, they will give a 6k mile warranty if 
I pay them $300.00 to put it back in!  If you know of a place that would 
give me a 12 x 12 warranty on one for around $500.00 in San Diego, let me 
know.  Also, would you go with a 1600cc?  The 1641cc ran too hot.  I have 
a poptop, so he's a heavy one.

Thanks!
