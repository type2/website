Subject: Screens and Smog

Thanks for the help/info on the screen replacement.  I never
would have guessed to slide the screen frame and then lift out.
Also, don't know how I was misinformed about the SELLER being
responsible for the smog certificate.  So I stand corrected.
I took 32 years for my first time being wrong!

-Scott.
