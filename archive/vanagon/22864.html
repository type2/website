&gt;Has anyone out there ever successfully installed a 110 AC unit in a Westy?
&gt;If so, I would really like to hear about it!

there was a fellow in town who had an air-cooled vanagon with an 110V RV
unit on top of his bus, run by a small gasoline power generator on this
front bumper. very strange looking. unfortunately, the generator is gone
now ... i guess he rear-ended someone and totaled the generator. :(

and there was a fellow from florida who used to advertise in some of the
magazines ... he had a 110V a/c unit that fit into the little luggage bay
on the top of westy's, and blew the cool air into the tent &quot;window&quot; ...
but it could only be run from shore-power. and i believe the cost was rather
high ... like $800 or so. i don't know if he's still in business or not.
