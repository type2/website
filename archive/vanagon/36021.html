Subject: Westy: '74-79 vs '80-83 which is better?

Hi all:

Writing this partly in hopes of causing the digest to spew another 
one before I go home for the day... ;-)  (I think I'm addicted, and I 
don't even have a bus yet...)

But, mainly, I've been wondering: what are the pros &amp; cons for the 
Westy models, late-70s &amp; early 80s. (aircooled only)

I've sort of decided the Vanagon style is more practical (ie: larger, 
usually more standard camping features, etc.), but I still like the 
'funkiness' of the earlier bus style. I like driving both, but don't 
quite get that 'feeling' when driving the Vanagon vs. the bus. Am I 
nuts...?

So.... what I'm really asking is: are they any major problems with a 
70s Westy vs an 80s one, especially with the camping ability? It 
seems that late 70s &amp; early 80s models are about the same price range 
around here, but the 70s are *much* easier to find. I've been passing 
over most 70s models since they seem overpriced (ie: $5000-7000 CDN!) 
compared to an 80+ model (most around $5000-9000), but now I'm 
wondering if I should start looking closer at them.

Of course, my wife prefers the Vanagon, probably because I feel (and 
act) about 10 years younger (I'm 28) when driving a bus....  :-)

Did any of that make sense...? Good thing it's Friday...!

Shawn.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
