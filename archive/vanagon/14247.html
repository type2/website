&gt; &gt;It's still making a hell of a racket, the same noise

&gt; &gt;I am now speculating that the noise is the pistons

&gt; Not good.  The first thing I would check is the end play on
&gt; the crank.  Give the pulley a good tug back and forth and see
&gt; if you can get any motion.  Spec is .004.  That's what was

Dave, I set the end play to .004, so I don't think that's the
problem.

The noise is fairly constant, although probably louder with the
engine *not* under load (eg. when shifting).
