Subject: Keeping it clean, more thoughts


Some thoughts on keeping your work clothes clean. Our 
esteemed friend Bob Hoover suggests cleaning them in TSP.
TSP (trisodium phosphate) is kinda hard to find around here 
because of ban on phosphates going into the Great Lakes. So 
here's a more ecologically friendly idea on &quot;keeping it 
clean&quot;. Take a tip from the Moms of America, and soak it. 
Presoaking is the key to getting rid of many nasty stains 
the painless way. Put your greasy stuff in a bucket of hot 
water, and the usual amount of your faveorite detergent for 
a washerload of clothes. And soak them for a day or two. 
Then drain and wash them. This drill works for me. And if 
they don't come out store bought new looking, that's ok! 
They're work clothes, and don't have to look perfect.
