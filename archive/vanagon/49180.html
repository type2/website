Subject: Gas Fired Heaters for Air Cooled Volkswagens

Hello,

I was given your group address as a possible place to locate gas-fired
heaters for air-cooled VWs.  I just moved from Los Angeles to North
Dakota and now winter is fast approaching.  I need a set for a Type 111
Beetle (1970).  Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciately.

Thanks,
Scott Jacobs
