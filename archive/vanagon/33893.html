&gt;America On-Line has crashed again, trashing all of my incoming E-mail.  
&gt;
&gt;I will be off the list while I move to a more reliable servor.
&gt;
&gt;AOL should consider changing its name to America Off-line since that is
&gt;becoming its normal state.

Right on Bob,  I did  the same thing about 6 mos ago.  They are the worst
and i beleive that they up to no good what with some of thier little quirks
that seem to keep you on line for more time i.e. &quot;adding new artwork now&quot; or
whatever they say.  i've gone back to school so I got free internet with
tuition.  hope you have good luck with your next server.  and be sure to
tell aol your true feelings about them I sure did.  Now they send me stufff
almost every other week Beggin me to come back.  screw them is what I have
to say.  OOPs proper protocol was I not supposed to say that? oh well.
Smart move BOb.
