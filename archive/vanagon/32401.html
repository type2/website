Subject: wild bus sightings

I saw a couple of interesting buses yesterday in Seattle. The first was
like a 66-70 crew cab, but had a huge boxy thing where the bed should be.
Maybe it was an ambulance. It looked like it was original and in great
shape. Unfortunately it got away from me while I was stopped at a light--I
wanted to follow it and chat with the owner. The second sighting was a
modified '69 or'70 that looked to be about 15% 50's era Buick. It had an
old Buick front bumper and grille, several additional air scoops carved
into the rear near the engine compartment, and fins! Just about made my
day...
