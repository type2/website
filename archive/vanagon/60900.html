Subject: oops! the rest of HELP message

Regarding:  Clutch Master Cylinder
Well I found the problem with my difficulties shifting into 1st gear, I 
think.  My clutch master cylinder is leaking.  Don't know why I didn't
look here first.. brain dead, I guess.  Anyway, its leaking and I have a 
replacement.  Soooo goood, sooo faaaar.  Bentleys picture is a little
vague here, and I have never done one of these before.  Mostly I'm 
having problems with how to access the &quot;clevis&quot; pin.  It seems to 
attach before the sheet metal, whats the trick??????? The rest seems to
be straight forward, but if you've done this, any light is more 
than I have right now.
Regarding Water Pump
This looks like fun.  Not!!!! Again any help and/or procedures would
be very. very welcomed.  I have never replaced one of these, and this
Bently, well, some of the pictures are nice, and some are, well I'm sure 
you know.
I'll be checking this computer through out the day and eve, again thanks
in advance for any and all help.
