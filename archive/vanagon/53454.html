Subject: Who sells VW mechanics overalls?

 &gt;&gt; A while ago, someone mentioned a person who sells VW dealer-style
 mechanic's overalls (used, I think).  Can't find any info on it in the
archives. Anyone know who this is?
 -Ron Salmon &lt;&lt;

 There's a guy in the Seattle area who does this.  I'll ask around, see if I
can find out who it is.  He usually has a booth at the local VW shows.
