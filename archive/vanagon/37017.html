&gt;Sounds like a damn good reason to avoid Texas.

It's still mostly a pleasant state.  We've got our fair share of gangs and
drive-bys, but I don't think it comes close to the amount of random mayhem
in L.A., New York or Chicago.  There has been only one recorded
freeway-retaliation shooting since the right-to-carry law went into effect
(around two months ago).

&gt;&quot;Excuse me sir I broke down and I was wondering if I could use your pho...&quot;
&gt;*BLAM* *BLAM* *BLAM*

That's already happened too.  It didn't fit the VW scenario we were
discussing before.  Drunk foreign national (Scotsman) goes paranoid while
getting a ride home from a pub and leaps out of the car.  At 3am, in a
residential area.  Starts knocking on doors, looking for help to &quot;hide him&quot;
from his former ride and help him to get home.  So drunk and confused that
he's really pounding on the doors, which include *back* doors. The last
homeowner that he awakens has had previous prowler problems and tells the
wild-eyed, drunken loony pounding on and shouting through his back door to
go away. He keeps smashing on the door and screaming, now that he can
finally see someone inside. The Scotsman is unintelligible in drunken,
brogue-laced ravings.  Homeowner finally shoots him three times through the
door.  No-billed by the grand-jury, as it seemed quite reasonable that he
feared for his (and his wife's) life. (The wife was talking to the 911
dispatcher when the shooting occurred.)
A wrongful-death suit was filed by the deceased's immediate family, after
they gave up on trying to get an indictment on criminal charges.  Having
few handguns in Scotland the whole ordeal seemed pretty unbelievable to
them.  Don't remember the outcome of the suit...

These are just the facts, and not necessarily my personal viewpoint or
opionion. Personally, I own nothing bigger than a BB-gun. I got it to scare
off the armadillos who left my backyard looking like the tee area at a
driving range (on a 31 acre ranch near La Grange, TX).
