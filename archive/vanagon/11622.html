&gt; I then spoke with an information specialist here at work...a library
&gt; dude.  He said that the composition was probably a trade secret, and
&gt; suggested the best he or I would come up with would be to find out
&gt; who makes the stuff...and we already know that.  He then went on to
&gt; tell a story about his grad school advisor that got so hung up on
&gt; the composition of a gas additive (that he couldn't find out from
&gt; the patent literature) that he had one of his students inject the 
&gt; stuff into a gc.....they basically watched peak after peak come
&gt; off for the rest of the day.  I don't think I'll be injecting
&gt; any waxoyl into my gc.

So contact Moss and ask for a MSDS for Waxol.  You might get some better hints 
as to what's inside, if you can use it as a gravy thickner or hair wax.
