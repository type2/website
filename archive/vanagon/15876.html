Subject: Re: Cheap places to camp


	Most California state parks are around $20 per night to camp 
with  a vehicle. You can check availability and make reservations- and 
presumably get a listing of the parks- by calling 1-800-444-PARK.

	Also, if you're a member of your state's AAA, stop in at the 
local auto club office and ask for their camping guide for California 
and Oregon- and other western states as well. These books describe 
many/most of the public and commercial camp places and the best part 
is that the books are free if you're an AAA member.

	My wife and I have planned road trips through most of the 
western US and British Columbia using little more than AAA books, and 
they've been great.

	Happy Motoring,
