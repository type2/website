Subject: Engine and Beer.

Well, it's a big day for Ger!
The beer finally arrived after I got the engine out of the car.
The two beers are Lionstone Red Ale from Stevens Point, WI, and Wildwheat
from Wild Board Brewing Co. in Dubuque, IA.  Also included was a rag
called Beer Across America with a bunch of Microbrew stuff in it.

Haven't tried any yet as I've been working on the engine.
We're just about ready to swap clutches and put the other engine in.

Wish me luck. If it goes badly, I guess I can just drink all the beer
tonight, right?  &lt;grin&gt;.

Thanks to all contributors.
Now I'm back to work.
