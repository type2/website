&gt;&gt; While we are at the topic of gauges, has anyone installed a oil pressure

&gt;&gt; worth doing, with the long run.  
&gt;
&gt;I haven't tried it, but my book says don't do it, unless you mount the
&gt;gauge very close to the engine.  The book said that with an installation
&gt;at the front of the car the gauge was still showing 40 psi while the oil
&gt;warning light had already come on at a stoplight.  I guess they had a
&gt;dual system installed on the car (?).  Anyway, I wouldn't try it.

OK. won't do that.  

BTW- All this talk on tach's got me motivated to put mine in.  It's a 3 1/2&quot; 
Sun unit, and fits real nice in the clock space.  I only had to fabricate a 
simple bracket and 3 small shims.  Piece of cake. about 2 Hours total.
