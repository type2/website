Subject: Re: Vanagon starter switch problems

Starter switch huh?
I too had a &quot;starter switch&quot; problem.  I was driving up US395 in CA about
10pm, stopped for gas, started again and NO LIGHTS!  Tried to look for the
problem for about 10 minutes &amp; gave up.  Luckily (especially since there was
no moonlight) I was driving with friends in 2 other cars.  One traveled in
front and one behind.  I started having intermittant operation of the A/C
fan.  After a while a solution occurred to me to be able to get my driving
lights (add ons) working.  We stopped &amp; tried it but my &quot;solution&quot; didn't
solve anything!  Drove another 2 hours w/o lights til we got to Mammoth Lakes
where we'd be staying for a few days.  The next day I started poking around
in the daylight but the cause still evaded me.  We called my friend's wife
and she overnighted us a copy of the Van's wiring diagram from the Bentley
book.  After using it to trace the light circuits I ended up back at the
starter switch.  I took of the plastic cover and started looking at the
switch.  I pulled the wiring harness connector off the switch and a dime
falls to the floor.  Yes, a ten cent coin!  Upon further inspection numerous
coins were found!  It seems that my daughter (then 3) had been playing by
taking coins from the coin box (sometime called an ash tray) and sticking
them through every crack she could find.  This dime had managed to get in
sideways between the switch and the connector!  This shorted out two
terminals on the switch caused a bit of heat &amp; melt and took out the circuit
that powers stuff that's &quot;on&quot; when the car is on but &quot;off&quot; when the car is
starting, like the lights.  Some temporary rewiring fixed the problem til I
could get back home and replace the electrical portion of the switch.

I occurred to me that without knowing the Vanagon pretty well and having the
wiring diagrams this would have turned into a major problem.  It made me
shiver when I thought about having to rely on a gas station &quot;mechanic&quot; to try
to solve this problem without the benefit of Vanagon experience and the
wiring diagrams!

So, what could be thought of as a starter switch problem turned out to be a
daughter problem.  You gotta watchem EVERY second - especially when they're
quiet.
