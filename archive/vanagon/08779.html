Subject: Coolant bleeder valves revisited (fwd)

Ok, Now we kick him off the list for sure.  Taking Dan Houg's advice 
(pertinent parts quoted below), I took apart the engine compartment 
coolant bleeder because my temperature dropped again and I'm searching 
for a reason.  This was a bad move.  As soon as the bleeder came apart, 
coolant POURED all over the engine -- most of it right on top of the 
distributor.  To stop the flow, I put my finger in the hole.  Since the 
engine was hot, and the plug had fallen under the car, this was 
pointless, and finally I let go and just let it flow.  With the thing 
apart I looked at it closely and decided that it's not SUPPOSED to bleed 
anything to the outside air.  It bleeds air between the IN and OUT 
radiator hoses.  The air that comes out ends up in the expansion tank or 
(if you've tilted the car enough) flows forward to the radiator.
So, the upshot is folks, according to my experience, the proper thing to 
do while bleeding is to open the engine compartment bleeder at the 
beginning of the procedure and close it at the end.  Some of the bubbles 
you see appearing in the expansion tank are due to the bleeder being 
open. Nothing should ever flow out of this valve into the engine 
compartment. 

YMMV MyOpinionOnly.

PS. No, I'm not going to remove anyone from the list who's mailer doesn't
send me over 10 bounce messages for each message bounced (grrrrrrrrr).
