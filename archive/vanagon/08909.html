Great - hope you can join us!  Probably the fish chowder will be
partly consumed by that time.  We'll try to save some for you in any
case, but maybe it would be better for you to bring something else,
perhaps some after dinner liqueur/brandy/etc?  Or even hot mulled
wine, or something else to eat/drink in the later evening if something
comes to mind.  

We missed you at pizza, but hope we can do more of these things in
the future. 

You can probably just chance getting a space at the kiosk upon
arrival at Pfeiffer, given that it's January, but if you want ot
be sure, I'd recommend reservations.
