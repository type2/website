&gt;Laugh...First they spell it wrong, they they invade. Good thing it's
&gt;Friday.

nah. The Official History of the United States of America clearly shows that
1) First we invade ...
2) THEN we spell it wrong. or worse, rename it.

is it any wonder that we are one of only three countries in the whole world
that has NOT converted to metric??? :)

by the by, does anyone know fer sure that the whole world uses pretty much
the same calendar?? like, does everybody have the same number of days in
the week?? if so, don't you find that just a little odd?? i do ... surely
somebody, somewhere, uses a week with only six days in it. &lt;and, no, i do
NOT mean those clowns in South Alabama ... they simply never learned to
count!&gt;

you know, sometimes it gets right lonely out here in the lighthouse ...
