&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Most people I know who have coolers in their engine compartment have the

&gt; &gt;&gt; Douglas, I'm going to have to put some of the weight of &quot;book learnedness&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; behind David. The air inlets on any year VW are oversized for their purpose
&gt; &gt;&gt; of admitting air to a stock engine. If that weren't the case, one would
&gt; &gt;&gt; hear a lot of turbulence-induced noise from that location at higher fan
&gt; &gt;&gt; speeds. The tiny passages between cooling fins are the real culprit in
&gt; &gt;&gt; limiting airflow, especially at high air velocity. Making more outlet area
&gt; &gt;&gt; should only help. The pressure drop in the engine compartment due to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; extra flow from the extra fan and outlet duct will be very small.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Then Douglas wrote back:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The engine compartment runs with a DEPRESSED atmosphere. If you merely put
&gt; &gt;a hole
&gt; &gt;through the engine compartment and put the cooler into it, air flow will be
&gt; &gt;inward; preheating the cooling air. If you put a fan on the unit to pull
&gt; &gt;air from
&gt; &gt;the engine compartment, you depress the atmo. more and reduce cooling. Just
&gt; &gt;opening the window vents makes a 10 deg diff in engine temps due to air flow
&gt; &gt;changes!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I had also written:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; This same principle is true for the flow of gases through the engine
&gt; &gt;&gt; itself: big carburators and high-flow heads are wasted if a decent set of
&gt; &gt;&gt; headers (preferably tuned) aren't used.

&gt; &gt;But a stock engine does not need any additional cooling. And just because an
&gt; &gt;engine is bigger does not mean it runs hotter. Its still pushing the same
&gt; &gt;LOAD.
&gt; &gt;No more energy is needed to push the load it under like conditions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If he still runs hot he's probily using cheap fuel and to much timing,
&gt; &gt;maybe to
&gt; &gt;lean on the carbs. Something else is wrong other than cooling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I had also written:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; And for those who don't trust over-educated types, if I remember my
&gt; &gt;&gt; inspection of Rev. Hoover's Grendel, it has the bottom-ducted internal fan
&gt; &gt;&gt; arrangement. Nuff Said.
&gt; 
&gt; We all agree:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you put it under the van, it will get wiped off the first time
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;you go over something in the road.
&gt; 
&gt; My response and Question now is:
&gt; 
&gt; Always implied if not stated was that a secondary (electric) cooling fan is
&gt; used to push air through a deck mounted cooler and out the bottom. Without
&gt; the fan, air comes through the hole into the compartment.


And Douglas wwrote back;


Just an old habit ;&gt;) I try to answer all the questions I can think of.

 
&gt; Granted, the use of additional oil cooling is often a treatment and not a
&gt; cure for the usual causes of overhreating: bad gas/mixture/timing, air
&gt; management, low oil, fan problems, etc. but I disagree that a bigger engine
&gt; will not run hotter. Increasing engine displacement without beefing up the
&gt; cooling system is a bad idea. Even if the stock and enlarged engine are
&gt; pushing the same LOAD the bigger engine is almost always going to have
&gt; poorer efficiency at the same speed (eg. gearing). This inefficiency leads
&gt; to heat production.


I must disagree. Carnot's equation states that the higher the engine temp the 
more efficient the unit. Work is work. If I push my split with a 36 hp at 60mph, 
when I replace it with my new 1600 DP 65 hp unit, I still only draw 36 hp (if 
that) to push it at 60 mph. Why would a larger engine run hot pushing a lite 
load? The engine will coast along at 40-50% load and should run cool. If not, 
you got a problem beyond an oil cooler;&gt;)
 
&gt; All that aside, cylinder head temperatures of enlarged VW engines seem to
&gt; be the killer, not oil temp, and the two do not increase at nearly the same
&gt; rate. Roasting heads may not show up as a large increase in oil temp.
&gt; 
&gt; Question: given that wing vents cause 10 degree F increase in temp, what
&gt; are my elephant ear mirrors doing. Also, are the aftermarket inlet scoops
&gt; the PO took off my splittie worth putting back on?

The point I try to make is that VW did a pretty good job designing these things. 
Most people try to use water cooled thinking on an air cooled beast (said 
lovingly:&gt;) VW's run hotter than water pumpers, period.

I run elephants too. Never overheat.

If you still have your scoops, put 'em back on. They really help.

I may have missed it but I thought the problem was with a stock engine. When you 
start field engineering mods you open a hole new (and real big) can 'o worms.

Have fun
