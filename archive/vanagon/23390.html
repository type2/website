&gt;My '63 bus has been converted to 12v, but the fuel guage reads max all the
&gt;time (except when engine is off when it reads 0)
&gt;A friend of mine has a 12v fuel guage out of a '67 (I like this friend
&gt;alot :))
&gt;Will swapping them over solve the prob? I'm confused that your 6v guage works
&gt;fine. Is there a sinister problem lurking in the elec connection to my
&gt;guage?
&gt;
&gt;Sarah.

Yeah. The wire going to the guage from the tank is grounded. There is a
connection were the wire comes out of the fuel tank compartment. Unplugg it
and see what happens. IF the guage returns to empty when you disconnect the
wire, you will have isolated the short: behind the engine!!! #$^%&amp;*** and
some more swearing when I went throught his drill. I cut a hole over the
sender, hunt and peck with a drill and flashlight...CAREFULLY....and cut
the hole with a 4 inch grinder. Then I had a sheet metal guy at work make a
cover for the hole. sealed it with silicone and screwed it over said hole.
Oh yeah, I fixed the wire first.

If your going to run a new wire, you should read bob Hoovers sermon on
wiring. It might be called &quot;let there be light&quot; or something like that.
Also check out &quot;soldering connections&quot;.

In fact, this is the worst explaination of how to fix something I've ever
seen. Perhaps someone else can make it more readable. I'm too tired.
