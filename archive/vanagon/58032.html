&gt; too bad our forefathers didn't think about the govt being able to tell you
&gt; you couldn't travel! Yes I know you can fly (if you have a govt issued

I know it's hard to beleive in these times, but the government is not some
etherial power from nowhere out to control our lives. The government is
the people ... at least the people that bothered to get out and vote. In
this vein the government REPRESENTS those people who did VOTE. The
government doesn't limit our right to *travel* from place to
place, but they do *regulate* the mechanism and manner by which we travel.
Without these regulations, life would be nothing but CHAOS! It's obvious
from the number of vehicles spewing out bad emissions or people driving
recklessly that they are and will not do what is right and proper. These 
same morons are likely the same people who do not vote and/or are not
active in the political arena. So those of us who bother to vote elect a
government that will yield to our desires ... enact laws and regulations
that will protect us from the morons, and in the same process protect the
morons from themselves.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending the *government*. I've seen and
experienced some of the really idiotic things they can do, but I AM
defending the only institution that can protect me from the morons out
there. 

Basic transportation. I agree with you! Because of the needs of
today's society, basic transportation should be a &quot;right&quot;, not a
priveledge. But basic transportation to me implies just that, basic
transportation! ... the minimal means to get you from point A to point B
(like from home to work and back). A stock Volkswagen comes to mind when I
think of &quot;basic transportation&quot;. But what we actually see and EXPERIENCE
out on the road are: vehicles that cruise at 90 mph with the
manuverability to quickly move in and out between other vehicles... and
it's not as if the drivers (a.k.a, morons) don't take advantage of this
ability; vehicles with $2000 stereo systems, but brakes that don't work;
vehicles with car phones and distracted drivers; and vehicles with all the
luxuries of home dulling the drivers senses ... unfortunately the driver
isn't at home proped up in his/her Lay-Z-Boy, but in a vehicle cruising
along at 90 mph.

Rights and responsibilities. Rights aren't something that are given to us
from some heavenly being. Along with our rights, defined or
implied, are innumerable responsibilities. As a citizen you are the
guarantor of your Consitutional rights. By exercising YOUR RIGHTS you
accept, knowing or unknowing, certain responsibilities. Sure! the
Constitution guarantees you the &quot;pursuit of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit
of Happiness&quot;, but where does it say that in your &quot;pursuit&quot; you can
rightfully impinge upon my &quot;pursuit&quot;. To guard against one person
impinging upon the rights of another, our government enacts laws and
regulations to *control* &quot;pursuit&quot;. For example, to protect me from being
hurt on the roads by errant drivers, the government requires licenses,
registrations, smog inspections, safety inspections of all
vehicles/drivers. If I want to exercise my RIGHT to drive, I must also
exercise my responsibilities.

In life there is no such thing as a free lunch, or free rights. Somebody
has the pay ... and the payment is everyone's societal responsibilities.

The alternative is for everyone to do as they damn well please. Fine,
I'll start driving an M1 tank ... goodby roads, landscape, and fellow man 
... bump! what was that ?, oh! just another sports car now compact!

My $0.02 and more ...
