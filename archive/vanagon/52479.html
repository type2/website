Subject: Re: iiGOT mine!  84 gl!


&gt;  Last week I bought my own Vanagon, a 84 GL, grey in color.  Blue 
&gt;interior 7 passenger!  The tranny was blown up, had the common broken 
&gt;off Alternator bolts ect.

Kyle,
	Congrats!!  I was wondering when you'd finally go for it! I suppose 
after driving my 83 around Santa Cruz all summer, you just had to have one, 
right?  (Hey, I've gotta claim _some_ of the credit here!:-) )
	Anyway, if you don't find a buyer for that '87 Wolfsburg interior 
you're selling, you could always put it in your '84...
-Ron
