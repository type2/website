Wrong!

&gt; Folks interested in Air-Cooled VW Type 2s should join the type2 list:
&gt; send &quot;subscribe type2&quot; to majordomo_at_primenet_dot_com.
&gt; 
&gt; To send a message to the air cooled list, send it to Type2_at_primenet_dot_com

The type 2 list has moved to another server.  Here's the scoop.

Send a message to LISTSERV_at_HOME.EASE.LSOFT.COM.

Don't put a subject line on the message; that is, leave the subject line empty.

In the body of the message (where you usually type your note), enter the
following:

SUB TYPE2 &quot;your name&quot;

To send a message, send it to:

TYPE2_at_HOME.EASE.LSOFT.COM

I have a '80 Westi, I find that I need both lists to get answers to 
my betwixt beast questions, not a split or loaf and not a waterboxer.
