Subject:       Re: Splash Pans for a '56 &amp; booty.


&gt; &gt; More information about the splash pan phenomena is needed and welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I've thought of these as 'belly' pans.  Often they were 
&gt; discarded.  They're good to have as they help protect the master cylinder 
&gt; and cables etc. from exposure to the weather.  It also helps keep 
&gt; excessive drafts from finding their way into the cab.  It also helps to 
&gt; have the little square rubber biscuits for the clutch &amp; brake pedal and 
&gt; also the booty for the accelerator rod to keep out the drafts.  8-)

I've always thought of the belly pans as the ones that cover the 
center seciton (on busses with sunroofs), and the front pan as well... 
the front pan!  Haha.  Not that I know much about it.

I didn't know about the front pan until I got my '57.  The '67 didn't 
have it.  Mine is off of my bus at the moment.  I guess it is time to 
put it back on as winter is coming to these parts.

And about the rubber booty.  WELL SHAKE THAT BOOTY!  Speaking of 
'BOO'ty, Happy Halloween to all those that plan to do a little 
trikkertreatin!  As for me, I'll just lurk around the corner scaring 
the youngsters...

Or maybe drive around in the bus dressed as Jack Kavorkian (sp)...
