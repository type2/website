Subject: Re: Cal Look Vanagon

&gt;I second the idea.  I've been toying with the idea of removing or
&gt;painting my chrome accents around the window rubber to get a 
&gt;&quot;cal look.&quot;  If anyone has had any success with painting, and have it
&gt;really stick to the trim pieces, could you let us know?
&gt;

Pull off all the chromed metal bits and get them sand blasted clean then 
primered/painted. This works, friends BMW 3.0 looks very good this way. I'm 
not sure about removing the chrome plastic strip around the windshield, 
isn't this referred to as a 'locking strip'? BTW... the panel van I have 
comes blacked out, handles, hinge, bumpers etc. Does it qualify as Cal look 
too? Do I need neon belly lights? tim s.
