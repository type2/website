Subject: Pescados Trip In July?
Date: Mon, 12 Jun 1995 14:44:44 -0700 (PDT)

Ok,

	Who, by a show of messages, wants to do some sort of Sac
get-together, say in July, at Pescados?

	Pescados is the place with the bus on the wall, shown in one of
the mags a while back.

	I don't know what else you'd want to do in Sac: we don't have a 
lot to offer.  Any ideas?

	The only things that come to mind are Old Sac, maybe going to one
of the river beaches.  Maybe I'll come up with something better later...

Thom
