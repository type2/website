Subject: Re[2]: The water heater project - Brads concerns

     Brad,
     
     &gt;This sounds like a pretty good idea to me! My concerns would be: 1) 
     &gt;the system must have an expansion tank since it's a closed loop, and 
     &gt;2) there must be some sort of relief valve (like on any heating 
     &gt;vessel) in case your water pump fails or your expansion tank isn't 
     &gt;big enough. I think that you did mention some sort of tank to let off 
     &gt;steam. If that includes a relief valve, you'll be in good shape.
     
     cheers for the concerns, and yes i've seen expansion tanks with 
     release valves in the filler caps with a little tube that allows the 
     steam or water to run away to the road.
     
     Lee.
