I checked the number on the motor currently in my '64 Deluxe with that on 
the warranty card (found in the Service Booklet).  The book shows engine 
# 0301353 and the current motor is # 0590821.  I assume that this is the 
&quot;G&quot; series 1500 (there is no &quot;G&quot; stamped on the case).

in 64  Does someone have 
a better engine number reference than Muir? (Most of my books are at work).
I'm curious as to the date of manufacture of this motor (and question why 
it is in such a low mileage Bus).  It could be that the PO used the 
previous motor to drive an external generator (or other contraption) and 
put a few too many &quot;hours&quot; on it.  There are about 16 holes in the floor 
above the motor and a manual throttle cable (handle mounted to the parcel 
shelf) along with the double pully and slot for the belt up through the 
floor.  It also has what I think is a rev-limiter or governor mounted 
under the 28-PICT carb.  It has the markings APG, Made in W. Germany, 28 
DR 1,5 on the face plate.
