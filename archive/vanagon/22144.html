Subject: hot vw won't start

a friend with another '80 Vanagon asked me about the following problem and
I didn't know the answer:

when he first bought the van a couple of years ago, he found that when it
got really hot it would not start. eventually a local vw garage told him
that this was common in older vans, that the starter was the culprit, that
once it was fixed it wouldn't happen again for years, and so they replaced
the starter for him.

well, this year it's doing it again. symptom is that the lights dim when he
engages the starter but there is no audible solenoid function, nor is there
any starter motor spin. if he lets is set awhile and tries it again, it
works fine.

any ideas? I'd be happy to relay them on to him!

TIA
