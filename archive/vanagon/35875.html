Autostop valves are available for much less at Euro-American RV Products.

You'll likely have to leave a message, but parts are usually in stock for
almost everything to do with the stoves, fridge, and water system for the
Westfalias. Prices are probably half or less than if you bought them through
VW. I do all my shopping there for these items.
