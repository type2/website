I ... used Westly's Clear Magic, a stiff scrub brush (actully several), lots of
elbow grease, and water. Spray the Clear Magic on the tinwork (or 
Simple Green, any of the biodegradable degreasers) and start scrubbing.
Rinse and repeat if neccessary. (Sounds like the back of a shampoo 
bottle, no?) This stuff works well, and isn't full of petrochemicals,
like the aerosol engine cleaners. Used it on the engine compartment
and the engine too.

As Ms. Moneypenny was getting a new clutch last night (last leg until I can
finally drive her for the first time!), I had a small window to get over to the
shop where she resides last night to clean out, what I believe to be, 24 years
of grime in her engine compartment. I also used Westly's Clear Magic (undiluted
in a garden, pump-mister bottle) after scrubbing as much of the caked junk off
with a wire brush (amazingly, without scratching any surfaces... well, aside
from mine anyway  :-).

At $8 per half gallon at a Western Auto, this stuff was a bit pricey, but it
really did the trick. Since I was in the compartment itself (literally in it
mind you, straddling the tranny, which was covered... &quot;please don't drop,
please don't drop&quot; ;-) I wasn't about to &quot;rinse&quot; with cold water as they
recommended. All I did was take a bucket of cold water and some old undies and
did as Lisa described, with stellar results! A small hint; the small hole in
the left pan, just under the spare tire well, was a very convenient drain for
some of the goop that I couldn't remove with the rags. The battery side was a
bit trickier, tho.

Being the master contortionist that I am :-), I was even able to reach up to
the *inside* of the side fresh air vents after spraying it up there!

I also did some quick detailing of the engine, in the areas that wouldn't be
easily accessible once it's installed; between the fan shroud and front tin, in
front of the fuel pump and distributor, and the front-underside.

Key points;
1) it's biodegradability
2) it's odor isn't too bad (I actually remember it smelling a tad like beer)
3) the fact that it did not irritate my eyes or other mucous membranes while I
was in the small space

Now, if I could only get rid of this twitch that I woke up with this morning,
Scott
Ms. Moneypenny, my '71 Westy
