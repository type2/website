Subject: bug tranny swap ?

Hey, there's still a few minutes of friday left.

Would it take anything other than plugging vacuume lines to switch an 
auto stick tranny for a true automatic?  I think the beetle in question 
is about a '70.  If not much hastle is involved in the swap, does anyone 
know if it is hard to replace the seals in an automatic tranny?
thanks.
Ed.
