Subject: Re: question about Macs and VW relation

The connection between Macs and Westies . . .

What can I say?

Between the office and home I have/work on:

	Mac Quadra 800
	Mac PowerBook 190CS
	PowerMac 8500
	PowerMac Internet Server 8150/110
	PowerMac Internet Server 8550/200

I drive/drove:

	Toyota Tercel SR5 4X4 wagons - 13 years, current daily trans is 9 yr 
		old, mint cond
	
	Westfalias: '80 Freida Roam - 8 year relationship, 
		'91 Gay Greta - 2 year relationship (recently burned to death)
	
	Triumph Spitfire 1500 - 10 year relationship (until brake failure)

All of these prized vehicles are/were collector's items - no longer available.
All but the '80 Westy are/were in mint condition.

Go Figure!

Perhaps its the quality and the look and feel of the machine?
