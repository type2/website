Hi!
When I started my 1986 Vanagon last week, I heard a loud &quot;clicking&quot; noise.
So I jacked the Vanagon up and removed the valve covers. I found one mushy
valve lifter - so presumed a leaking lifter.  I have ordered a replacement -
but now wonder about the adjustment of the valves.  I know that when setting
the valve, you screw the adjuster until it touches the valve stem - then
screw it in another 2 turns.  My bus was not (originally) set like this - I
think the screws were turned in only until any gap was removed - and maybe a
1/2 turn more.  
I also found (last time I did this) - that when I adjusted the valves as per
instructions, that the valve was lifted from its seat - no compression on
cylinder 1.  No one has been able to explain this behaviour - so I ended up
adjusting it only to remove any valve gap (as it was when I bought it) - and
have driven it for 5000 miles or so without incident.  
Can anyone explain this or give me some advice on setting these valves?
Thanks,    cheers
MIKE
