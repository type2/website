Hiyer Tim,

Saw the initial post, and this response.  I think the coolant problems
warrant more than disregarding.  There IS a problem, sounds like the
internal head gasket leak (worst case) or a bad pressure cap (best case)

bye, Tim

I dunno, my '85 has done the same thing when in hot weather and idling. 
 Never while underway.  I'm positive I don't have any internal HG leaks.

Don't put so much in.
^^^^^^^^^^  what! ???????????????

No kidding, that worked for me.  See, on mine the problem seems to be that 
the translucent coolant tank has developed a crack at the top seam.  That 
means when the van gets very hot, as the coolant expands, it oozes ( or 
shoots ) out of the top of that translucent tank instead of flowing through 
the tube to the black overflow ( surge ) tank that sits right next to it.

If you reduce the amount of coolant, --not so that there is none in the 
translucent tank--, but so that the level is slightly reduced until it 
won't reach that spot at the top of the tank, then you're in.  At least 
that worked for me, until I get a replacement tank.

It really hasn't made a difference in the way my temperature needle moves, 
but not being a professional mechanic, I dunno if it's having some other 
effect.

 Why have I never heard this fan
&gt; before????

You are a Yankee!


Ahem, but aren't you all Yankees?
Time to go cook some back bacon now.

Y'all take 'er easy, mon frer,  A Southerner.
