&gt;From: Dean Paul Karpowicz &lt;chinaski_at_csd4.csd.uwm_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; &gt;West Coast Metric has just come out with a watercooled parts catalogue
&gt; &gt;which includes Vanagon parts. If you want a free one, call 1-800-247-3202.

&gt; Has anyone actually received one of these &quot;catalogues&quot;???
&gt; I called their line over a month ago, and haven't seen anything yet...

I got my catalog last November.  I called sometime before that when I saw
their ad in Hot VWs when they had a new watercooled catalog.  What they sent
was a four page listing and a price list.  I was disappointed because I was
looking for other parts for my Rabbit and was expecting a catalog similar to
the aircooled catalog.  I guess they were working on the catalog at the time
because I did not expect it when they sent the new one.  They do have a lot
of things for Vanagons but not everything.  I have not place an order so I
do not know what the parts are like.
