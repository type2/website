Regarding the simultaneous lighting of the OXS and Batt light-While 
limping home one night in second gear due to a loss of a clutch 
cylinder, my OXS light and batt light started blinking and eventually 
went steady.   When I went to check the alternator, lo and behold, a 
wire which has a spade connector which connects to the alternator had 
vibrated loose.  I reconnected, started her up, and both lights were 
out.  I mentally pocketed the money I could have spent at a repair 
shop.  As an aside, while driving home stuck in second, numerous 
people, mostly in old beaters, pulled alongside and gestured as if to 
ask if I was OK.  Sure beats getting flipped off!

VW Sightings: Noticed two Vanagons, and old Westy, and a EV parked on 
the same block (1st St SW and N St in D.C.) Someone has good neighbors.
