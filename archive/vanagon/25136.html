&gt;as usual, my sliding side door thinks it is not part of the bus and 
&gt;would like to go its own seperate way.  It looks like the area of the 
&gt;door that the bottom roller bracket attaches has rusted out and the 
&gt;bracket has pivoted upward.  Does anyone know of a good fix to this 
&gt;problem?

The only thing I can think of is to start looking for another door!
