Subject: Oil Temp questions

Hey all!

The discussions regarding oil temps have been very interesting. Here's a 
couple of questions that I don't think have been covered.

With all the different locations to install a sensor -- sump, dip stick, oil 
pressure relief boss, the rear galley (Bob Hoover's recommendation) and 
supposedly the best spot, after the oil cooler -- what exactly are the 
variances? Some locations are cooler, some hotter. Is there a 20 degree delta 
or more? 

When one says max oil temperature is that max temperature reached regardless 
of measurement location? Or is it, ideally, the temperature of the oil 
reaching the bearings? 

Is the delta of sump temperature and post-cooler temperature critical? 

Just wondering,
