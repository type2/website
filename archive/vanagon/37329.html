Subject: Re: oil burning on new engine


&gt;&gt;But in all honesty it seems a step backwards.  The only Diesel engines 
with
&gt;&gt;which I have any familiarity are Cumins, which have a very low oil
&gt;&gt;consumption and regularly achieve service lives of half a million miles or
&gt;&gt;more.
&gt;
&gt;        Ok, who's gonna run out and put a Cummins in their bus? Steve?
&gt;Anyone??


Size-wise, I believe a bus fits better inside a Cummins Diesel.  :^)
