Subject:      embarrasing moment

Preface:  I was moving a couch with my chevy pick-up

ok, ok...this isnt a bustory, im a wannabus, but this was an
interesting event at the time, you see i used to smoke...

in this instance it was camel lights,
i was moving a couch from home to home,
i was also a litterbug,
(justice will prevail...)
i through the butt out the window.... then...
while at a stoplight i smelled something kinda weird,
and not just your everyday, smokin, kinda weird smell....
but a definitely wrong kinda weird smell,
assuming it was just my old truck,
that is makin the really kinda odd and definietly weird smell,
i continued...
at the next stop sign the weird smell became a weird smell which
resembled fire in my rear view mirror....
it still smelled really bad,
as you would guess the butt I tossed landed in the couch,
smoldered for a while and started the couch on fire.
I pulled into a gas station, ran in,
and discussed in a calm yet very hurried and tense kinda tone
&quot;Quick.._dot_can i have a bucket of water!  my couch is on fire!!&quot;

the attendant must have had to think twice, there really
isnt much near the station, that is with regard to couches,

i'm sure everyone will be happy to know,
i put the couch out, quit smokin and turning things into butts,
and definetly quit litterin,

(and writing my name on little glossy pictures and putting
them at the bottom of piles of garbage in illegal locations....
for sure!!!) [arlo fans]

but i still like pickles.
