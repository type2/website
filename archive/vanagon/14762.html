Subject: video 4/9


Ok, folks, the time has come to make a decision!  On the table we
have this suggestion to meet at this weekend's swap/show near San Jose
and watch Sam/Susie Williams and my video (and see anyone else's snapshots
from the trip) from Redrock.  The plan is to watch these either using
a power inverter, or on my 9&quot; AC/DC combo tv-video cassette player
in one of our cars.  The idea here is combine the activity with
something else that would be of intrest to us all, namely the
vw show Jon Peters suggested, which takes place on Sunday.

Also on the table, was a suggestion to meet somewhere like Big
Basin or Big Sur, or somewhere not too far afield from the show
in the south bay, and to do this on Saturday, camping overnite, and
then progressing to the show on Sunday.  If this plan matures,
we'd have our potluck dinner on Saturday at the campsite.  If
we decide NOT to camp overnite and to meet on Sunday only, he
proposal is to have the potluck dinner on Sunday evening
in someone's van, or maybe a &quot;progressive&quot; van dinner party,
moseying from car to car?  :)

Anway, we need a democratic response here!  Which is it?:

1.  Meet Sunday only at the show, potluck dinner after.

2.  Meet Saturday to camp, have the dinner, camp overnite, then
     move on over to the show on Sunday.

Let me know your feelings, and I'll proceed with helping to
organize accordingly!
