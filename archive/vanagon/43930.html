&gt;&gt;The motor was also purchased from a listmember, and was supposed to
&gt;&gt;have under 30,000 miles since a full rebuild.  However, I cannot
&gt;&gt;make it run.  It backfires _badly_ through the intake (we're
&gt;&gt;talking flames here!)
&gt;
&gt;That's a sure sign of timing being off.  WAY off.  I seriously doubt there
&gt;is anything wrong with the basic motor, based on your post.  Line the thing
&gt;up at Top Dead Center and make sure the rotor is pointing pretty close to
&gt;either the #1 or #3 plug wire.  If it isn't, turn the distributor until it
&gt;is.  If the rotor is already pointing at 1 or 3, swap the plug wires over.
&gt;Switch 1 with 3, and 2 with 4.  Then try starting the engine again.  This
&gt;has ALWAYS worked for me.  Usually, I am off 180 degrees.
&gt;
&gt;p.s. If this doesn't work, suspect your measurement of TDC.  Don't trust
&gt;the mark on the fan.  You should be able to tell by looking at the valves -
&gt;turning the engine over, TDC will be at the spot about halfway between when
&gt;the intake valve closes and the exhaust valve opens.  You can tell
&gt;approximately where TDC is by when the motor is easiest to turn.  If you
&gt;get this far (valve covers off) do this on #1, and then compare to rotor
&gt;position.  Almost foolproof for setting basic timing.

I once got the distributor drive in, well not right. The rotor did not point
at #1 when the cam was ready for #1. 
I was not able to get the dist drive out, so I had to swap wires until I got
the sucker to run.
Live and learn.
Good luck.
