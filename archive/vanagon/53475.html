&gt; I'm curious, did she leave you because of your Vanagon obcession?  My Vee
&gt; Dubb hobbies have come close to ruining relationships.  But in the long
&gt; run, the VWs will be more satisfying ;-).  Sure, send me the gory details,
&gt; I want to hear about other people's personal agony for a change.

   &quot; In the long run&quot; she will let you down more than your Vanagon!
