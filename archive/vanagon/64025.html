Subject: Bus Boys Saga Continues..... But there is hope... maybe....

Hello all:
I finally got a return call from Doug Hufnagle? owner of 
Bus Boys.  It turns out he is a dentist, and doesn't even
run Bus Boys.... I will admit it was good to finally get some
communication started....  Albeit rather weak...

Here's how it went:

He wanted to know if I wanted to hear his story.  I said sure.
He begins by asking me if I know Jim, when I say yes, he wants
to know how.  I tell him I don't aactually 'know' him, but that
I am familiar with who he is etc....

He then proceeds to tell me how Jim &amp; Bill tried to destroy 
his company.  They stole things out the back door, erased computer
files, destroyed records, etc.....  Goes on and on about how there
is a CASE #, and they're going to jail.... blah blah blah.....
Telling me how it's all their fault and BS to that effect. I quickly
reminded him that it was his company and therefore he was responsible
for the actions of his employees.

(In no way am I trying to slam Jim or Bill, I am just relating what
the guy who *stole* from me told me, so take it for what its worth.)

I tell him that is all besides the point and as far as I am concerned
it has nothing to with my situation.  I think this guy chuckled more
during our short conversation than I have in a week...  he kept
avoiding the real issue.  Wanted to talk about company policy etc..
Trying to say it wasn't company policy to credit an account unless
they had received the parts back.  To that I asked, is it company
policy to steal from people?  no real response to that one.

Finally, after me asking several times, he says he *can* credit
my account instantly, DUH!!!  But, does not say he will!!  He does
say he *wants* to make things right. Yea me too!!  Then he wants
to call me back, etc....  Conversation ended with him saying he
would call me back.

He brought up the internet :) asked if I was the one who had been
posting, I told him yes indeed it was me.  He wanted to know if
I was going to post more, I said yes indeed.  He wanted to know
what I was going to post.  I told him whatever you do is what I
will post. no response again.

So, maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel. I can only hope!

I'll let you all know what happens.

peace-
Rob
