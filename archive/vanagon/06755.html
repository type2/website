Hi James

I know you have a yonger car than mine (I have a 72 Kombi).  I had that same
trouble and was told by the VW guy I go to for advice that the cables had
probably seized.  They had, but also in the brake drums, one of the pins
holding the shoes was in the wrong hole so that when you pulled on the
handbrake, it couldn't pull up.  I have had the car for four years and never
had a decent handbrake, now it is excellent.

This info probably isn't relevant to you, but just thought I'd put in my
comment.

&gt; I have an '85.  In site of having it serviced regularly, the hand brake 
&gt; does not hold. On even a mild slope, it will give easily.
&gt; 
&gt; Any way to fix that myself or check on the type of fix needed?
&gt; Thanks.
