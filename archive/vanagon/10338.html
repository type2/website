&gt; What I don't know is if that engine is the same &quot;Wasserboxer&quot; engine 
&gt; found in our late model Vanagons or (in typical VW fashion) some 
&gt; completely different design altogether?

  A very kind lady who is at Stanford gracefully lifted her.......engine
  compartment lid for me on her Mexican VW camper. The engine is an inline
  4 that looked very Rabbit/Golf like to me. It was inclined towards the
  driver's side about 30 degrees. It had a carburetor and air cleaner which
  were right up by the top of the engine compartment. She told me that they
  had bought the bus new in 1989 &lt;now, doesn't that sound odd - a 1989 
  breadloaf bus&gt; and that it had never given them any problems.
