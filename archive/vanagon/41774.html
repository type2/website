&gt; &gt; 1968-69     Pearl White
&gt; &gt; 1970-71     Pearl White
&gt; &gt;             Titian Red
&gt; &gt; 1972        Pearl White
&gt;
&gt; I think it would be save to add that light blue color (whatever it's
&gt; called) to the list for '71's, since that's what my van's original color
&gt; was. I'm certain it's an original Westy, but I can check further for
&gt; verification if anyone wants me to. Please don't tell me I have the one
&gt; rare light blue westy for which there's been a $20,000 bounty for years;
&gt; I just painted her a different color. =0 Joe

That color is, I believe, Niagra Blue. Not sure of the code number...
