Subject: Timing for 009 in '70 bus engine?


A quickie re-send for a post that doesn't seem to have made it.

What timing should I set my '70 bus engine (single-port 1600,
30PICT-3 carb, 009 distributor)?? 0degrees?  10 BTDC?   ...???
Engine is stock except for the distributor, which is a new 009
just out of the box. I set dwell to 48 degrees.
