Subject: rear heat exchanger (odor)

Time for another mystery.  My rear heat exchanger produces a strong pungent
odor as soon as the blower switch is turned on.  I see no evidence of
coolant leaking, though I did not run it for very long.  

Any theories or further tests would be appreciated, because fall (for
Juneau) is not that far away.
Thanks
