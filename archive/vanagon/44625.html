Subject: 2nd Oil Cooler...
Date: Tue, 18 Jun 1996 15:49:59 -0700

Well, I've postponed my trip cross country for a couple of days, since I've
been really thinking hard about a secondary oil cooler for the long haul.

        I contacted the local VW shop and they said they would install a
cooler, with an electric fan, with a manual switch etc...for about 325$.
Said the parts are about 165$. Is this reasonable?

        Also they said they mount it inside the engine compartment, over in
the left side, where a spare battery would go. Is this a good place for an
electric fan cooler? Or should I have them mount it somewhere else? I don't
want to mount it on the side of the bus, but maybe underneath, near the
tranny?

        Any and all advice appreciated, the quicker I get this done, the
sooner I leave! : )     Thanks, Tom

&quot;So you're going to take us for a ride eh?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, come on&quot;
&quot;Well I don't have a sister!&quot;
&quot;That's ok we no gotta car!&quot;
