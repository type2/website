Subject: WTB&lt;76&gt; propane tank

A friend of mine needs a propane tank complete with valves for his 76 Westy.  He
wants to mount it on the driver's side.  I do not know if this is standard
location or not.  He has modified the bus so maybe he has to mount it there.
Will a vanagon unit fit there?

Thanks
Joe Fahy
