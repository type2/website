Subject: Re: Redline MTL for '88

About using MTL in the '85 Jetta TD
I WANT TO NOTE, MTL IS NOT THE CORRECT FILL FOR
FWD VW's.  VW WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY FOR USING
IT.  FOR VANS IT IS GREAT STUFF, FOR FWD, SOME USE
IT WITH SUCESS OTHERS CLAIM IT CAUSES PROBLEMS.

That said Redline solved the problem by issuing a fill specific
for FWD VW applications like this Jetta, the correct stuff is
MT90 in 75W90 as it should be, in GL4 only, for a new FWD
VW application this is the choice, but the MTL at
80W90 might be a good choice for a high miles box, the thicker
oil taking up some of the slop and backlash.

Anyway I also note MTL available for about US $7.50/qt in
whatever quantities one wants if you shop around.
