Subject: Fuel consumption?

    HI Everyone.
    
    I'm sorry if this question has been bashed around this group in 
    the past, but I only subscribed three days ago.  I'm wondering ...
    
    	    Is there anyway to improve the mileage on my '72 Bus??
    
    The last '72 I had didn't seem to suck the gas like this one does, 
    but this bus is a little different:
    
    *My old bus was not a Westy, this one is.
    *My old bus had a dual port 1600, single carb engine, this one has 
     a new 2.0 litre, dual carb engine.
    
    Do these differences make a noticable change in the mileage I 
    get??  Or is the Gas Tank on the '72 really small??  Or is it the 
    aerodynamic, butter-dish design?? 
    
    Please help, the folks at the gas station are starting to know me 
    by name. This scares me.
    
    Thanks in advance
    
    Eric
