&gt; Fuel Gauge
&gt; ----------

&gt; For some reason the PO installed a 4 gallon fuel tank(or is this standard...
&gt; always thought it should be 8 gallons). When I fill up the tank the fuel
&gt; gauge reads 1/2 full(makes sense since it should be an 8 gallon tank). But
&gt; I thought a fuel gauge reading was independent of the tank size, true or false?

Actually it should be 40 liters, about 10 gallons.  I don't know why 
anyone would want 4 gallons, I want to put in a 15 gallon tank.
