Subject: Re: vdo cyl head temp sensor location?

my VDO cyl temp gauge came with a special bi-metallic washer that goes under
the spark plug that I have put under #3. This comes with oits own wire that
goes all the way to the dash. THis temp sensor shows all the time as it needs
no battery voltage to work. My guess is that the PO or the garage threw away
the bi-metallic wasjr &amp; wire.
