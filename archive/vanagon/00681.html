&gt; 
&gt; I am looking for sources for rust repair parts and replacement rubber pieces
&gt; for my 1977 VW Camper. Any info on where to look or a list of phone #'s and
&gt; adresses would be helpful...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,

Brendan-

I did a lot of rust repair on my 77 camper last summer.  I got the panels
from TABCO in Cleveland and rubber is available from West Coast Metric in
So. Cal.  You can get both numbers from their ads in Hot VWs or VW Trends.
Sorry I don't have them handy.  Good luck.
