Subject: 87 syncro GL: rough running


Lately my van (136kmi) has developed some mild hesitation while running, 
especially for the first 1/2 hour of the drive.  It is not a serious 
bucking, just a small acceleration/deceleration i can feel in the seat of my 
pants--not completely smooth.  It idles fine at just over 800 RPM, even when 
cold.  Recently, i replaced the plugs, wires and ran a can of BG-44K, not so 
much for this problem, just routine maintenance, i don't think the two are 
related.  OXS is overdue for replacement, I have a new Bosch 3 wire ready to 
go in.

I had the van in at the local mech (for unrelated shift box replacement) who 
has done a fair amount of work on VW's and vanagons.  He too noticed the 
'surging' or roughness and suggested either the airflow meter (the 
additional box on the air filter canister) was not moving freely, or that 
the throttle body needed cleaned.

What do list members that are in the know about VW digifant FI think?

Thanks,
