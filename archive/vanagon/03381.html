Subject: Re: Florida lemons

Hey I've added my piece several times.

I'm so sold on the Eurovan that when I tell people about it I have to
'power down' my lest they think that I work for VWUS or I'm 
trying to 'market' the thing.

We've taken our fourth long trip (of 4,000+ miles).  I've never come off
one of these trips feeling as delighted as I have in the Eurovan.

It drives well, seating is very comfortable (particularly, on the very long
stretches), being able to 'see' all-around is important to me
and I can do that.

I'm a bit of a pack rat and a gadget-person. I can store plenty of stuff all
over and still have comfortable space for people. I've got big and little
things added to or hung on in many places and most people can't tell
because it still looks tasteful.

When I compared dollar-for-dollar the Eurovan to other vans, I would have
paid A LOT MORE for the other vans to get what I have in the Eurovan.

And .. perhaps, most important of all, after a year+ my chief advisor and
Head-of-Finances agrees that the Eurovan is a good investment!

As for repairs and repair-time, it's been minimal. The recalls,
scheduled servicing and servicing for normal wear-and-tear have been the
few times that my dealer has seen the vehicle back in the shop.

I can talk about lemons but the Eurovan ain't one of them!!
