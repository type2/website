Subject: Re: next CCC's outing
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I wanted to send out a message to Jeff Carver and Martha plus the rest
&gt;of you to apologize for my last minute decision not to go to Tahoe this
&gt;time.  As it was, it turns out it was a good thing I didn't go.  I had
&gt;a 100+ fever and was chilled and achy.  I'm sure none of the participants
&gt;would have liked to have shared this germ (whatever it is) with them.
&gt;I am work today, but definately still whoosey like a hangover.  I hope
&gt;you folks that went had a wonderful time and that Linda and I can join
&gt;you at the next get-together.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers!
&gt;
&gt;Steven
