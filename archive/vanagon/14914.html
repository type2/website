&gt; OK, How about something like this, frankly we the easterners seem
&gt; divided, most 5-10 posts seem to want a central or southern leg
&gt; although a around 5 want a northern leg, how about a route that
&gt; consolidates both in the beginning then we split...

Great idea!  Only thing I would worry about is how long for the tour to
stay together after leaving St. Louis, but I don't have a map in front of
me at the moment so I can't look at your proposed route.  Some of the
other East coasters want to jump in and help plan?  =)
