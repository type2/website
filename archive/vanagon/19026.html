Subject: Re: synthetic trans fluid notice


&gt;&quot;CAUTION! This trans should be filled with 75 or 80 weight SYNTHETIC 
&gt;GL-4 rated OIL.  We recommend Redline MT-90, or VW synthetic ( p.n. 
&gt;G005 000); this is what the factory uses.
&gt;
VW don't list a synthetic oil for VWs (vanagons), at least here in Canada, 
the only synth oil they stock is for Audi. I asked all this less than a 
month ago.

I wanted to use synth, NO WAY sez the service manager, 25 years _at_ VW and 
Porsche dealerships. Used Castrol GL-4 80/90W. Just a chicken at heart.   tim s.
