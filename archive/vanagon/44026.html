Subject: Replace Clutch?

Last Saturday I successfully removed the engine from my '77 Westy with the
hope of figuring out what is wrong with the left side head.  This was certainly
the biggest mechanical adventure I have ever untaken and it went very smoothly.
Boy these things are easy to work on.  It took about 4 hours to drop it and
that was working very slowly marking everything.  I would like to thank 
everyone who gave me wisdom and encouragement to get at least this far.
Now to my question:
I will certainly replace the clutch if needed so what do I look for to tell if
it is needed or not.  I don't know if the clutch has been replace in the past
or not but is possible the previous, previous owner did some work on it 
although I saw no signs of past engine removal.  It at least has not been 
touched since '92 when the PO bought it since she kept excellent records and
had all work performed by professionals.  I believe approximately 20-30,000 
miles have been traveled since '92.
I hope everyone can figure out my ramblings and give me some advice on
observable clutch wear.  I noticed no slippage when I last drove it.

Thanks for your help once again,
Brett
