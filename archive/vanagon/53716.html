Subject: german bks-in-print URL


The following is a wonderful URL for what is basically Germany's
&quot;Books-In-Print&quot; catalog, plus capability of ordering.

--

Start
at a Dusseldorf bookstore (German and English)

http://www.stern-verlag_dot_de/

or go to the search engine (only German)

http://www.buchkatalog_dot_de/bin/isuche.exe?aktion=suche&amp;caller=sternvlg

and find every book available on the German market.

--

Now, does anyone happen to know a URL for the US Books in Print
catalog??
