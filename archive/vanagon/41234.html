&gt;I want to replace my cassette/radio  with a dash mounted CD player.

&gt;Following Ajax' hints from a few weeks ago, I ordered a Crutchfield catalog
&gt;as basic reference material. After drooling for a while, I called the 800
number to find 
&gt;out what size reciever would fit in the Syncro Westie. The sales rep said I
could 
&gt;not exceed 6 1/4 inches in depth. That pretty much excluded 95% of the head
units
&gt;they had listed, including ALL the dash mounted CD players.
&gt;
&gt;Who has been down this road before?  Is the 6 1/4&quot; restriction for real?

I had a Sony 600 DSP installed in my '90 Westie.  It's a nice unit, and the
Digital Signal Processing really gives the sound a richness.  (I usually
play it in 'hall' mode... it seems appropriate for the Vanagon.)

The unit sits flush with the dash, has a removeable face, and sounds great.
I would expect that all Sony CD players would fit, since this is a
top-of-the-line model.

P.S.  Good Guys! did the install.
