While there are only two of us in Nebraska I should point out that I 
live about 3 miles from I-80.  This is the big east-west interstate 
that runs through the middle of the country.  So, count me in.  I 
don't have any vacation and am tied to this desk and computer but 
would welcome one and all to Lincoln for an evening or two.  Let this 
be a general invite to any and all passing through here.  Look me up. 
I'm in the book.  402-438-6599.  My dad is listed right above me in 
the book, James Sr.  Hell, you might call him too, he used to own a 
'71 bug.  :)
