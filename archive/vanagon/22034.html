Subject: rebuilt heads


Hello all,

I'd like to preface my first post to this list saying that i have little 
money or mechanical skill.  However, I have an 80 Vanagon with a 
dropped valve seat.  I have heard that there is an outfit in California 
that rebuilds heads fairly successfully, Tahatchapi i think, a guy named 
Mark Stevens.  A very generous fellow list serve member has agreed to 
help me drop the engine and diagnose any other problems for only a 
nominal amount of beer.  I guess id like to know if anyone out there has 
had any experience with Mark Stevens rebuilt heads, and if that 
experience was good or bad.  Thanx in advance.
