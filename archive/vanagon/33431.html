Hi all!
	Boy have I been busy lately!  But I finally got to play with
the bus this weekend.  I adjusted the valve and put in new plugs, new
rotor and condenser next weekend.  I also did a compression test, and
after the valve adjustment things look MUCH better:

	#1	#2	#3	#4
	105	110	120	110

but there seems to be some differences here, and am a little afraid of
#3 being 15 off of the number #1.  Any comments?

Also, after adjusting the valves (they were all on the loose side) and
before and after putting the new plugs in I noticed a power loss.
Before I could drive on flat stretches and drive easily at 65mph and
faster if I wasn't paying attention and my foot got heavy.  Now if I
take the bus to 65 I feel as though I have hit top end, and I feel
less power going up hills and such.  Any way this weekend, UKY the bus
gets new points and rotor and condenser and such, and I'll probably do
the valves again just for sport and practice.  Any ideas about the
power loss?  I would think that with higher compression (before the
valve adjust the compression test was below 100 in 2, 3 and 4) i'd
have more power, not less.

Well, that's about all.  We're getting ready to &quot;customize&quot; the
inside.  add a shelf and bookcase, hookup the sink, and pull up the
old linoleum and put down new and such.  

Hope all is well for everyone.

take care,
	brandy
