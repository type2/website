Subject: Re: 23 Window prices

     &gt;&gt;There was another `58 23-window for about 1,000 bucks here.
     &gt;
     &gt;The talk of prices for 23 window splits in the States has me 
     &gt;*absolutely* salivating.  Can you in fact, pick up a 23 window for 
     &gt;less than $1000 US?  I Or is reading this list driving me mad and 
     &gt;have me lusting after the impossible?

     Go for it Rob, you may be suprised how easy (not saying cheap) it is 
     getting stuff from the States. I know it's a long way but there's 
     always a ship coming across to your area so its no big deal to stick a 
     bus on it.
