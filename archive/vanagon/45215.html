Subject: Back..finally

        Ack..going cold turkey is no fun. Our server crashed and we had no
mail capabilities for a week. But alas Im back...and all of you are back as
well. All is right in the world once more. Ahhh.
Had a great weekend.....packed 6 people in the van an went to the drive in.
We even had enough (barely) room to play a game of Risk....which I ended up
winning. Maybe that had something to fo with the fact that I had the nice
swivel passenger seat.

        I'll be looking into tire information over the next while as that
will be one of the three things I must get done before my 2 week adventure
starting Aug.3. The brakes and repairing/replacing the rubber pop-top trim
will be the other 2 things that Ill try to finish.
        I had hoped I'd have enough cash to install a secondary battery,
but with that mighty repair bill a week back it doesnt look viable. As sad
as that is.

good to be back,
