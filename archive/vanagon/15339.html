&gt;If these do exist for the 68-71 (or later) breadloaves, I'd sure like 
&gt;them.

Had the foot pedal cover which spans the main longitudinal boxes on a '71 
Westy, '72 Westy, and I believe on a '75 Kombi and '78 7 seater. ie on 
almost all breadloafs? . Had also a belly pan, spanning long. boxes between 
front and rear jackpost crossmembers (covered the gas heater) on '75 &amp; '78. 
Either of these should be easy installs, using large hex head sheet metal 
screws (bolts!), just position and hold up with jacks/wood blocks and drill 
the box tubes. Grease the screw/bolts before torquing them in and they won't 
break so readily.
        The front pans are great for snow bank surfing and real deep water 
hydroplaning. It is un-nerving (sp?) to lift the front wheels of ground for 
extended periods, ie. blasting flooded intersections at 30 mph, as there is 
NO road feel and any slop in the front end becomes really apparent.  tim s.
