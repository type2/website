&gt; here's my woe.  I've already received good advice but I thought I'd toss 
&gt; this one into the ring.     Just bought a used 88 westy in great shape 
&gt; only to discover rust around the seal of the fron luggage section of the 
&gt; roof.  How do I remove that cover to get at the rust and will I have to 
&gt; remove the headliner inside?  And further what to do with the rust.
This was the first thing I did after getting mine in March. You can 
remove the top without dropping the headliner, just be careful the 
rear bolts don't drop through the roof. They are held in place with 
rubber grommets, and mine stayed in place nicely. Just remove the 
two front, two side bolts, pop the plastic caps on the rear nuts, and 
remove them. The top lifts off easily with two people.

Looks like I'll be doing it again soon - sanded, applied rust remover 
&amp; two coats of Tremclad, but rust is showing already... aargh. I did 
rush it the first time though. :(

&gt; Plus... one more thing noted that the impeller on the water tank 
 pump was 
&gt; off the shaft and further that the bottom of the whole contraption was 
&gt; simply taped together.  should I glue the whole thing together or use 
&gt; plumbers tape!

I replaced mine with an external pump, so I can't comment on fixing 
these. Sounds like yours may be on its last legs...
