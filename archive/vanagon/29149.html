Subject: electric and hanging question about fan motor

hi everyone, i have two questions.  

ATTATCHING:
	i have a fan motor, a piece of plastic the fan attatches to,
and the two ducts that attatch to this piece of plastic.  what is a
good way to attatch it to the top of the engine compartment?  what
kind of grease/oil should i lube it with.  i am going to clean it up
of dirt and rust and paint and lube it.

ELECTRICAL QUESTION:)
	i was testing my new heater fan last night and have some
questions about how it hooked up so the switch works up front.  my
basic setup from what i can tell from when there was a heater motor is
the following.  there is a little circuit drawn below that i think
acts to complete the connection up front.  (this is the picture
printed on the box, and this is how i believe it should be hooked up? 

30 - the wire from the front of the bus (which i believe is a ground
     wire that is &quot;grounded&quot; when the lever is pulled).
87 - ground to the fan motor
85 - a wire directly from the battery, there is a fuse in this wire.
86 - power to the fan motor.

i believe that when you throw the lever up front, you connect it to
ground, thus completeing the circuit and turning on the motor.  bit
when i hook it up this way, and touch the power from the fan motor to
#86, is all i get is a click sound out of the little box drawn above.
but i know that the wire from the battery is fine since i can hook the
fan directly up to a good ground it works.  the wire from the front is
OLD, and very thin and using a voltmeter i don't think the connection
is reliable.  i want to replace it, where do i get wire and what
gauge(?) do i need.  how could i just install aswitch instead of using
that lever, or is hooking it back up to the lever easy.  assumiong i
want a switch (since i want one for something else i am going to do)
how/where do i get one?

just call me the electrical dunce:)

thanks everyone for any advice you can pass my way.  take care all,
