If it was me, given the same circumstances,  I would first:
1&gt; Put the van up on jacks .
2&gt;Remove all the tires. Have them checked and balanced.
3&gt;Remove all the drums. Mike them.
4&gt;Check out the the brakes. (87.49% probability you will need front and
rear brakes and rear wheel cylinders. 
5&gt;Remove rear axles w/CV joints. Repair, Repack or Replace CV's.Replace
boots.
6&gt;Remove axle stubs with wheel bearings. Also R,R or R.
7&gt;Drain tranny, check for chunks. Refill.
8&gt;Reassemble and enjoy for another sixteen years.
Good Luck

&gt;Hello all-
&gt;
&gt;When turning right I notice a clunking/cow bell type sound coming from 
&gt;the
&gt;driver's side tire.  Any ideas what it could be?  I notice more on 
&gt;slow
&gt;turns but that maybe due to less road noise. In gereral there is a 
&gt;fair
&gt;amount of creaking from both sides when going over bumps. She's an 81 
&gt;and
&gt;was driven infrequently before I purchased her.
&gt;
&gt;Also before I attempt to run the air conditioning do I need to get it
&gt;checked and &quot;recharged&quot;  (whatever that means).
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the help.
&gt;
