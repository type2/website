&gt;&gt;&gt;Uh... couldn't you achieve the same thing by throwing gravel at a
&gt;&gt;&gt;pile of Coke bottles? But that wouldn't be music (either), would it?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;no, but hanging a bunch of metal pipes outside and letting the wind bang
&gt;&gt;them into each other is.   ???  :)
&gt;
&gt;One of the things Cage was exploring was just what *is* music anyway?  If 
you
&gt;think about it, it's pretty hard to define.  For almost any definition you
&gt;come up with, someone else can say &quot;Well, yeah, but what about XXXX?&quot;.
&gt;  As I see it, Cage's 4'33&quot; is a piece that asks you to stop for a few
&gt;minutes, think about what music *is* and listen to the music of the 
*world*.


Another thing he was exploring, was to find how many empty-headed
ninnies he could get to sign on to the notion that his theories had
merit. To the embarrassment of the music world, he actually turned up
some. Peter Schickele (sp? a.k.a. PDQ Bach) did this too, but at least
his pieces were funny and somewhat melodious, and not intended to be
taken seriously.


&gt;But this has nothing to do with Vanagonia.  At least it's FFriday.  (That's 

&gt;Friday, but Fortissimo...)

Amen. Take the coda! Time to fill the ice chest, toss the surfboards
in the back, and bus on down to the beach.
