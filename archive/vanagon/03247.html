&gt;Funny you should mention ergonomics.  In 3500 miles on the road with  a
&gt;couple of over 8 hour days, I never had one twinge of pain or discomfort
&gt;in my back.  I've never driven a vehicle for that long that I could say
&gt;that about -- GMs, Pontiacs, International Pickup, Other VWs, BMW 325,
&gt;Mind you we were sleeping in a tent for many of those 8 days on the road,
&gt;too.  I was just amazed at the end of the trip.

that's what i really like about the vanagons: my butt doesn't hurt at the
end of the trip (and i have a BIG butt, folks!) ... in my old 1971 bus, my
lower back would hurt after about four hours. which, if you think about it,
was really better ... cause it forced you to stop and take a break. with the
vanagon, i can keep on rolling until i collapse. :)

about the only real gripe i have about my 88 is that they took those armrests
off the doors and replaced them with the fold-down armrests on the seats. me
personally, i prefered that the armrest move out of the way when i opened the
door. :)  but i guess i can live with that.
