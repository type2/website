&gt; Subject: lock-cylinder on sliding door

&gt; How do I get to the cylinder on the slidingdoor handle?  I can
&gt; pull the handle from the door and remove a big ring. then the
&gt; action stops. Do I have to push the oval shaped piece of metal
&gt; out ??

Once you get the handle out of the door, there (probably filled
with crud and rust) is a *very small* set screw sunk in the side
of the cylinder housing.  You need something as small as a
jeweler's tool screw driver to remove it and I suggest soaking it
in solvent first.

Once you can turn the set screw out enough, the whole cylinder
will drop out.  It is prudent to have your key in the cylinder
when it does as the little wafers/springs are &quot;peened&quot; into place
and over the years that bit of metal wears off so the whole thing
may spring apart if there's not a key in it.

This basic set-up is true of most door locks on buses and VWs in
general.  The sliding door arrangement is more prone to getting
rusty than the rest of the door handles because the O-rings and
handle-seals deteriorate from all the opening and closing.

Hope that helps.
