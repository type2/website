&gt;fast question, on the 86 synchro does the exhaust system have to be 
&gt;removed to replace the rear pressure switch. VW is charging me for

If everything is rudted, time is about right.  Are they repalceing hardware
with something better???  Even if they don't use stainless, they should at
least use grade 10.9 or better.  It makes a difference on future repairs.
