I hate to admit this...but in addition to three Air Cooled VWs... (two vans
and a beetle) I also own a watercooled VW (81 Rabbit.)

Where can I get some information on the internet to help me sort out
a bad idle and surging FI problem?

Man, this one car is more trouble than the other three put together... All
just so I can have ONE car with Air conditioning. And it is running so
poorly I can't even use it.
