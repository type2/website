Dear list members,
I hate to bring this thread up again, but I have a problem.  I want some 
touch up paint and can't find my code.  I looked under the dash, under 
the drivers seat in the battery compartment, in all of the door jams, all 
to no avail.  I even found someone else in town with the same color 
westy, but they do not have the official name of their color or the plate 
or code either.  We have 86 westies, mine is a full camper GL, the other 
is a weekender.  I think it is the Bronze Beige Metalic color, but the 
'beige' in the name throws me for a loop; is there any beige in this 
color? or is it mostly bronze? Does anyone know what Savanah Beige is? Is 
the Merian Brown a flat brown?  (I got these names off of Joels list in 
the archives for the 86 Synchros).  I looked around for pictures on the 
web to see if I could identify the color, but found not many pictures of 
vanagons.  Anyway, if anyone knows these answers or knows where I can see 
some pictures of these colors, that would help alot. Thanks
Gretchen
