Subject: heater blower project

Putting the JC Whitney heater blower in a Vanagon is not real tough: take
out spare tire, cut out section of insulated flexible duct (probably absurd-
ly expensive, measure twice -- cut once), install blower with giant hose
clamps, support blower with cable ties so that giant hose clamps only seal
it, not support it, wire it to a switch on the dash.

BUT it is very noisy.  If I did it again, I would put the new blower in the
engine compartment, blowing into the existing heater-air system.  Also with
regard to heat, important gains can be had by removing the flapper valves.
Just run aluminum duct hose right from the heat exchanger to the duct on
the body.  In NJ and points north, you were never going to turn off the heat
from 10/15 till 4/15 anyway, right?  If we get a warm spell, open the windows.

And no smart remarks from water-pumper drivers and Floridians, ok?  That
coolant leak is your penance for your smart mouth.
