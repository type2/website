Subject: re:my possible purchase

All,

Thanks for the info regarding the 79 Camper. Tomorrow morning I will attempt
to contact the person, and go see it.(Damn I'm getting wierd. I will have
4 cars if I get this one, or any one for that matter. Only 2 will be VWs
though). I will let you know what I find. I am pretty confident that it will
still be available, as there was a 76(maybe) that was listed for at least 3
weeks in the same paper. Who knows if it one of those rare vehicles that
grabs you by the throat and wont let go until you part with the money for it
my next message may be one of those &quot;Joel change the stats&quot; messages.

Thanks again for the info,


David
