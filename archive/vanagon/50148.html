Subject: Still more Syncro questions

Hi Syncro folks---
     Still driving myself crazy (not to mention the people trying to sell
their cars) trying to find Just the Right Car.  I've checked out several
(o.k., four) local Syncros FS, one real P.O.S, one OK, but high miles, one
absolute creampuff but WAY outta my league $$, and one VERY nice one (at a VW
dealer no less, and actually sort of reasonably priced).
Here's today's questions:  All except one made a clanking noise while
shifting.  Is this a quirk of the linkage, or a symptom of some bizarre
Syncro-only problem?  Do all Syncros have the same undercarraige ( I seem to
recall my ill-fated '87 having more metal around the engine)? How 'bout
driving in REALLY hot conditions?  
     The one at the dealer had some jive 30 day warranty, but the guy made
some noise about possibly being able to buy an extended warranty (drivetrain
only).  Comments?
     That's it for now, many thanks!  Matt Q.
