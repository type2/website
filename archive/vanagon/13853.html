Dear Ms Rubin,

Both methyl and ethyl alcohol burn to CO2 and H2O.

Insufficient oxygen gives CO2 H2O and CO...

Some years ago at a campground near Lake Almanor I chatted with a fellow who
had a Jotul stove in his van vented through the roof.  He was from Whitehorse
Yukon Territory.

Jotul is a Swedish or Finnish wood burning stove.
