     I'm posting this for a friend:
     
     
     This is an announcement for a camping weekend in Stokes State Forest, 
     Branchville, NJ, group campsite A. It will be held June 2-4, 1995. 
     There will be: Friday night bonfire, caravan to scenic Sunrise 
     Mountain, Saturday night turkey roast (we were at the first turkey 
     roast and it came out *really* delicious!!), frisbee, kite flying, 
     bicycling, close to: fishing, Appalachian trail, Lafayette Outlet 
     village, antiques shops.
     
     There are public restrooms and water nearby (sorry, no 
     hookups/showers). Cost: $1 per person, per night (you read that 
     correctly!). Site available from noon Friday to noon Sunday. Sorry, no 
     pets allowed.
     
     Yes, this is the weekend of the Orangeburg, NY shows! Some of &quot;the 
     men&quot; are planning to go to the parts show on Saturday from Stokes. 
     Mostly everyone will
     go to the regular Orangeburg show on Sunday, after leaving Stokes.
     
     Bring your Westy (or other vehicle) out for a good family time!
     
     For more information, contact by phone Ron and Becky Maxon, 
     201-238-1710, or e-mail Lori Gelato, gelato_at_vax88a.pica.army_dot_mil. Hope 
     to see you there!
