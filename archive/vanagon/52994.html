Subject: Fire warning, Coleman fuel cans



Here's a msg which whizzed across the wires of both Outdor-L and Backpack-L
this evening.  I then found a similar alert at &lt;www.cpsc_dot_gov&gt; (Consumer
Products Safety Commission) under November Alerts.  Else, I've got know idea
about its veracity (or its truth, for that matter).

Forward as you wish, but leave my name out of it.  Flame on.  :-)
