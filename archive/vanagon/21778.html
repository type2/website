Subject: pop-up camper 'lift off'

I was driving accross the golden gate bridge on the way home from work on
what must surely have been the windiest day of the year. Of course my bread
loaf was all over the road, but that's another story.

MY camper top kept lifting up slightly, and then banging back down. It
seemed pretty violent.Ddo I need some type of additional hold downs on the
front. The back is held down by the usual rubber strap and hook. I'd like
to mount my surf racks on the roof, but I'm loath to have the whole mess
blast off the car.

I would welcome any suggestions for beefing up the present system.
