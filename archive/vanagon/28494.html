Subject: Re: Harbor Freight Torque Wrench?

Johnny--

Saw your note--

&gt;	There has been quite a bit of mail on the 3/4&quot; ratchet set lately 
&gt;and I am planing on getting ASAP.  I am still an under equipped neophyte 
&gt;and I need to buy a torque wrench.  I noticed that Harbor Freight has a 
&gt;3/8&quot; drive, 0-80 ft/lbs(unit?) for under $20.   Is this a good wrench for 
&gt;a do-it-yourselfer? Or should I pay the $50+ for a Craftsman?  (I hope 
&gt;this is not a religious issue.)

Don't know anything about the Harbor Freight, but I have had a Craftsman
(1/2&quot; 20-150 lbs--the ratchet kind that clicks when you reach the right
setting--more accurate and easier to use in tight spaces than the kind with
the scale) for about 10 years and it has done well.  However True Value now
carries a Master Mechanic that runs from 20-250 ft lbs for $85 (in our store
anyway).  I would buy that one if I needed a new one now.  Several parts of
my 86 GL (flywheel bolt, rear wheel hub nut) need 250 ft lbs, and I have had
to rent the Master Mechanic.
