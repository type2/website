Subject: ticking, you were right

Yes, that sickening ticking sound went right away after a short warm up
period and few minutes of driving.  Judging from the number of you that
provided the correct diagnosis, this must be a real beginner vanagon
question. I feel a little silly but thanks to all of you for the quick
response. 

A related question on oil (which I just changed prior to the sticky lifter
event).  Eero VW in Juneau recommends 10W30 year around for vanagons in our
cool summer climate.  This does not seem to be consistent with any of the
advice I have heard from the many oil posts so far.  Are they giving me
bogus information?
