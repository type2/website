Subject: Re: Front Suspension Squeek

Suspension squeks up front usually caused by Upper control arm bushings.
 These are available aftermarket and the bentley manual gives good
instructions on instalation.  You need to tack weld them on non Syncros to
secure them to the arm.  Note that the eccentric washers are actually shims
and come in three sizes.  If there is a gap when putting the arm back in, you
will nedd to get thicker shims.  Do not force arm back in place or use the
mounting bolt to pull the arm together.  This will cause the new bushings to
fail again.  I found the many vans are not shimmed correctly to begin with so
order shims before taking van apart.
