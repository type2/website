Subject: Re:  propane tank label--dangerous defect

&gt;What is the liability of not having that label on there?  Isn't it suppose
&gt;to be left on?  Can you clarify this?  I'd like to remove mine, but I just
&gt;want to know the legal ramifications.

I bet removing the label violates some rule somewhere. But who cares? In 100
years no VW Camper owner would ever be prosecuted for this. 

Come to think of it, I removed the silver factory labels from my camper that
say &quot;LP Gas&quot; on the side. I am sure this is illegal as I now have a vehicle
with dangerous explosive gas but no sign. 

&gt;Under Florida Law, the label must be firmly affixed to the tank or the
&gt;propane dealer will not fill the tank.  Some of the newer tanks have all the
&gt;information (date of manufacture, last date of inspection, etc..) stamped
&gt;into the collar guard of the tank and therefore will produce no need for a
&gt;label...

Don't think that you could find a propane place that will check this label.
In about 100 fillups I have never seen anyone ever check the label. On a
Vanagon, is isn't going to be done cause the guy has to crawl under the van
with a flashlight and clean off the tank to read the label.
