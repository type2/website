Subject:      eurospec headlights

i don't think that i would bother with the search for eurospec lights
( other then for the chi-chi factor ),  i just substituted 60/100
bulbs for the stock 55/60's on the low beam side of my 91 synchro....
the output is tremendous with no apparent ill effects on the charging
system.  i doubt that the headlight switch will last forever on
highbeam unless you put a relay up front. i don't belive that the
wiring is a problem, as it appears to be of sufficient guage to handle
the increase of 40 watts.  long term experience with several series II
gti's seems to confirm this.  all of them had 60/110's and didn't fry
a single wire...

bought the bulbs mailorder from one of the ads in car&amp;driver or auto
week and the output equals the h-4's that i had on my 930 with the
same wattage bulbs

cheers,
jim catterson
