I did the rear bearings on my 76 a couple of months ago.  I had no 
special tools, and boy was it a hassle.  Took me ALL day!  I was able to 
drive the races in/out with a CAREFULLY placed punch or big, big socket, 
but the worst part was getting the circlip located inboard of the inner 
race off and back on.  I modified an old screwdriver to fish the clip 
out, but had to do the old twisted-wire-through-the-circlip-eyelet-
then-cut-the-wire-once-it's-in trick to get the circlip back in.  And it 
took a LOT of force to bash the inner race in far enough to allow the 
circlip to seat.  Ugh.  I'll take it in to a shop next time (No, not a 
VW dealership, Sergio...) if I can't afford to buy the tools to do the job 
efficiently.
