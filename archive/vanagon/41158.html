Subject:      Vanagon shocks...keep it coming!

I've been meaning to write for a few days. I'm glad someone opened the vanagon
shocks topic as I suddenly need new shocks (ok...well...it's been coming for a
while!). Anyway, I'd greatly appreciate hearing pros and most importantly,
CONS of each of the shock choices anyone has dealt with. Not being much a
mechanic, I guess I don't understand about how things that can be bought with
a lifetime warranty, need to be replaced. I'm also having a hell of a time
with my brakes. I've put on new pads 2 years straight (2 times) even though
the older pads were fine. They just started squeaking like hell again... not
all the time, just enough so the rest of my hair has started falling out. BTW,
anyone seen a hub cap laying around? I'm in need of a single of the grey
saucer shaped ones with the vents around the periphery and it says Volkswagen
next to one vent. I know I can get a cheap knock off set but I've been
patiently waiting for the right one for nearly 2 years now. To further cause
hair loss, I've discovered I need new driver &amp; passenger window seals. Not
being sure if I can do an adequate job, has anone paid a garage to do it?
Cost? I'm looking at purchasing the &quot;Euro&quot; type seals because I hate that
short-lived chrome strip. Well...I've blabbed enough. Anyone else?
