&gt;I too saw the 4x4 VeeWee (VW) in Munich.  It is called a Synchro.
&gt;It is definitely factory.
&gt;
&gt;They also make a Synchro Vanagon (I've actually seen these in the
&gt;US).  A former roommate calls it his &quot;Dream Car&quot;.

There are many in the US. If you want more information on the Synchro,
look at the Quattro list. Subscribe by sending a message to
MAJORDOMO_at_swiss.ans_dot_net with SUBSCRIBE QUATTRO
[address_at_address_dot_com] in the message body.

There are very knowledgeable people on the Quattro list.

Shannon
