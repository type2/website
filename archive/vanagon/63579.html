Subject: Gree O2 Wire replacement?


Hi all,
	According to my Bentley the green signal wire leading from the O2
sensor to the ECU is available seperately from VW.  Has anyone replaced
this?  I need a part #, since my dealer is inept.  Of course if anyone has
an extra wire lying around please let me know.  TIA.
