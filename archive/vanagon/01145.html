Subject: 87 vanagon exaust ??

Frank...I've got an 88GL and my dealer, Georgetown in Smithtown, NY, is
suggesting and entire exhaust replacement from the headers to the tailpipe.
their estimate is just shy of $1200 for the whole shibang including the
labor.
 
They won't just do the muffler and tailpipe since I've got almost 100k mi.
on it. They said that if they just try to do the muffler and tailpipe, the
rest would just end up breaking anyway since it's so old and got a lot of
milage on it.  They'd have to do the whole exaust system or they couldn't
guarantee the work.
 
I don't have all the tools to do exhaust work and quite frankly don't have
the time anymore either. The $1200 price seems somewhat reasonable
considering it's a VW dealer. They've done good work on my Vanagon since
I've found them and have steered me right so far. I'm just going to have to
hit up my CU for a loan and get the thing fixed before I get a ticket...Joey
