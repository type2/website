Subject: List Traffic Appeal

Due to the recent attention I have caused at the University's central mail
hub, I'm a little paranoid about running the list at all. As such, I am
appealing to all of you to reduce your message size as much as possible.
The biggest way that we can do this is to stop quoting messages you reply
to.  There is little or no reason to quote messages on this list since the
traffic is very great and the archives are easily accessed.
So, I beg of you to reduce the message quoting.

Thanks.
