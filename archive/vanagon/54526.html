Subject: Re: Tiny orange switch right of steering column below dash?

&gt;Does anyone know what this thing does? It is on a relay kind of thing with
&gt;stickers that say on and off with red and green colors. My van stalled at a
&gt;light and I couldn't get it started until I tripped the switch. It acted
&gt;just like the G.F.I outlet in the bathroom.

Is your van aircooled with a gas heater??
