Subject: trip report :(

Hey all,
Well, I have made it home to Johnson City, Tennessee.  

Anyone who got mail today from my old account, it's because I telnetted in there
from here.  

Well, let's get down to it.  This trip was not as merry as the others I've had.


Over spring break, not so long ago, I drove my bus home and back with absolutely
no problems, except the nasty no-start gremlin which has since been exorcised.

Well, this time was a bit different.  My bus was COMPLETELY loaded with stuff
and therefore a lot heavier than normal.  It was around 80 - 90 degrees
depending on where I was and I had to go on Interstate 64 and Interstate 81,
which are hilly (mountainous even).  To put it bluntly, I believe I overheated
my van somewhat.  I didn't burn any valves or anything like that, but I could
tell my van wasn't too happy.  

First of all, going up the mountain on 64 is a long, steep hill.  I went up it
in fourth most of the way until my speed got so low I had to downshift.  Well,
after I crested the hill, it began missing a bit.  Cleared right up in the next
couple of minutes but it was kinda scary for a bit.

Then, over rough roads near Roanoke, VA, my passenger side mirror (which lacks
the seal to the body because no one has them anymore) decide it didn't want to
stay upright and swung down a bit so it was useless.  Pulled over at a rest area
and righted it but it fell down again.  In the McDonald's parking lot, I rigged
a gasket using the little soft plastic covers that go over the centers of the
coathooks (used two of them), cutting out their centers and putting them over
the mirror threads and then screwing the mirror down.  Works like a charm!  So,
anyone who has this problem, those little things make good gaskets.  Plus, my
bus is white, so they match.


Stopped in at McDonald's for lunch, came back out, hopped in the bus, turned the
key, and nothing.  Oh shit.  The no-start demon is back :( .  Got under the bus,
whacked the (brand new) solenoid with a wrench, got back and turned the key,
nothing.  Tried to get the bus to roll so I could pop the clutch, wouldn't roll.
Tried the key again, lights dimmed, hesitated a second, and then starter kicked
in. Weird.

Drove across the street to the cheap gas station, and reluctantly shut the
engine off.  PUmped my gas, paid my money, got back in the bus, turned the key
and started right up.  Whew!

Hit the road again.  No more apparent problems but lots of long hills.  

Turned on to the last stretch of interstate (181) and oil light flickered on!
NO!  Well, it flickered off again, so I proceeded cautiously as I was almost
home.  It stayed off until I got off the interstate at my exit and when I
stopped at the bottom, flickered on briefly and then went off again.  Not good,
I thought.  Made it home with a couple more flickers and promptly shut the
engine off.  Engine did NOT smell good.  Unloaded all my stuff, then tried to
start the car to move it.  No start demon :( .  Popped the clutch in reverse (my
driveway is sloped) and pulled the car to it's parking spot.  

Checked oil.  MY LORD!!!!  It's a half-quart below the minumum line!!!!  Filled
it up right away.  My bus has never consumed this much oil before!  It usually
doesn't burn any.  I topped off the oil before my trip.  I can only attribute
this excessive consumption to the heat and the load my engine was under.  I am
currently using 10W-40 oil but tomorrow I'm doing an oil change and I will
replace it with 20W-50, a heavier oil.  Hopefully that will be thick enough for
the summer months.

The no start demon has left for now.  I think I can also attribute that to the
excessive heat of the day.  Once the bus cooled, the problem went away.  What do
I need to do to fix this no start problem?  Is the Muir solenoid a good idea?

I hope my bus is OK :( .  Seems to be doing better now.

I'm not subbed right now, so reply directly if you've got something to say.

Take it easy,
Sean
