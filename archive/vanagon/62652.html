Subject: Fan noise

Hi

The blower fan in the dashboard (vent, defog, etc...) makes a terrible
noise.  It's intermittant and varies between a quiet squeaking to a 
constant, irritating, squeal.

I assume that the fan needs to be replaced (or maybe just lubricated).

What I'm interested in, is how much work is involved in getting at
and replacing the fan?  I've read somewhere on the list that it's
not an easy job to remove the dashboard.  Is the fan behind the dash
or can I reach it from underneath?  I have a VW mechanic friend who
said he could replace it for $200, but I'd rather do it cheaper.

Any suggestions?

Thanks
