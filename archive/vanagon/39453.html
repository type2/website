Subject: FS: 1985 Westfalia Weekender

I just bought a '90 Westy with a full camping interior, so I am selling 
my '85 weekender.

1985 Vanagon Westfalia Weekender (no sink or stove), automatic 
transmission
Color: Bronze/Brown
Miles: 174,000
Price: $1,500
Location: Philadelphia, PA
Contact: Kevin Corcoran Phone:(610) 604-4989 Email: ransom999_at_aol_dot_com

Details:

Mechanical: The van is in fairly good mechanical shape, although it does 
start hard on wet mornings. Also, it runs hot in stop-and-go city 
traffic. (It runs normal temperature on the highway and in light traffic. 
I believe this is a bad coolant temp sensor, but I have haven't gotten 
around to replacing it.)  I recently had new front shocks put on.

Body: The van has a dent above the right rear tail light. This dent is 
not very large, but in kind of an awkward place at the van corner. The 
rear bumper is also bent out of shape. Surface rust at the dent.  The 
rest of the body is pretty rust free. A little oxidation in that crease 
under the driver's side door, and a small surface spot near the driver's 
side rear jack port.

Camping Interior: The pop-top and canvas are in good shape. Downstairs, 
this particular layout has the rear bed and a rear cabinet with shelves 
that can be removed so it can be used as a clothes closet.  There is no 
sink/stove cabinet. Instead the rear bench extends all the way across and 
there is a backward-facing seat behind the driver's seat. There is also a 
flip-up table. Once upon a time, there was a removable, cooler-sized 
fridge behind the passenger seat but this was (predictably) permanently 
removed by previous owners.

General Interior: The front seat upholstery is somewhat ragged, but the 
seat frame and cusioning are in good shape. Right now I have on seat 
covers of the cheesy K-mart variety, but it looks better than the ragged 
seats.

Stereo: Heidelberg IV stereo/tape deck in good condition.
