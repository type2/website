&gt;A while back, Erik asked about fuel sender units:
&gt;  &quot;Is there any way of testing it before I reinstall the whole tank?&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;  I expect the normal electrical continuity through movement range test 
&gt;was related to ALL, but a nice trick that should be used when it applies 
&gt;to high milage vehicle designs, is to flip the wire wound resistance 
&gt;sensor coil over before the mobil contact paw abrades all the way through 
&gt;any of the wire wraps. This generic approach applies to hundreds of 
&gt;vehicle designs and doubles their effective life.  On some, just bending 
&gt;the contact paw so that it rubs the coil in a different arc will do.  The 
&gt;idea's the same: Don't let it wear all the way through any single wire 
&gt;wrap, and it will keep on serving you well.
&gt;  Hope this helps someone.
