I have (fart) used vinegar to fart, I mean remove the farty smell from the 
fartniture in my housefart.  It seems to overfart, I mean overpower the smell 
of the animal farts/urine.  You may (fart) want to try it, and they also sell 
all farting kinds of animal scent/stain/fart removers at pet supply fart stores.

Good luck and keep on farting.
