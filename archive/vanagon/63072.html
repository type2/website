Russ,
It's not a TDI, just a plane TD... Big difference. BB

&gt;As per an article in &quot;european car&quot; (or was it &quot;vw&amp;porsche&quot; then), a
&gt;swap they did with a TDI block into an A2 Golf required clcearanceing of
&gt;the valve cover and to the hood insulation as the TDI engine assembly is
&gt;about an inch or so (to the best of my recollection) taller than the 1.6
&gt;assembly.

&gt;&gt; Well,
&gt;&gt; My new 1.9L TD finally arrived on Wed. I've been ohing and ahing ever
&gt;&gt; since. This is quite a spiffy motor, looks like it will just be a drop
&gt;&gt; in.
&gt;&gt; Modifying the engine mounts does not seem necessary, as is the case
&gt;&gt; when
&gt;&gt; using a 1.6L TD from a Jetta or Rabbit. The turbo is much smaller, so
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; appears there'll be plenty of clearance. The unit came with a factory
&gt;&gt; exhaust pipe which will have to be cut and redirected but no problem,
&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt; having the flange was more than I'd hoped for...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Things to resolve: Air cleaner location and mate up to turbo.
&gt;&gt;                    Fabricate exhaust system
&gt;&gt;                    Pick-up tube extension for oil pump ( Scott Foss
&gt;&gt; has all
&gt;&gt; the above, for a price)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm having my old DZ tranny rebuilt with 4.57 ring and pinion and
&gt;&gt; original
&gt;&gt; gearing. That should be as sufficient as any, short of a five speed.
&gt;&gt; It
&gt;&gt; should be back about Wed or so. Lots to do.
