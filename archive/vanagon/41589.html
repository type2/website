This is how I got my '63 Dodge.  The guy that owned it fixed stuff, sold it
to someone who fixed stuff, bought it back from him and fixed more stuff.
Then he got pissed 'cause it wouldn't start and he'd replaced about
everything.  About a year later, he had to move, so rather than get $40
from the junk yard, he gave it to me.  I gave it a jump, and it started
right up.  I had it refuse to start on me, it was the condenser... the only
thing he hadn't replaced. :)

ObVWContent: I believe it's my good VW karma that allowed me to get yet
another free car.  Just remember, be happy, love your VW, and it'll love
you.  :)
