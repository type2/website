Subject: Adjusting your toe-in


                              Alignment Basics

Your front wheels incorporate caster, camber and toe-in.  Caster is when the
wheel touches the ground a little bit behind (or ahead of) the axis on which
the wheel pivots during a turn.  Caster-angle is usually built-in to your
front suspension.  On a torsion-tube VW front end, caster is adjusted by
shimming the top torsion tube a little farther forward than the lower torsion
tube but that would only be necessary in extreme cases.  Normal caster is
built-in to your spindles.  If your trailing arms and ball-joints (or
kingpins) have not been damaged through wear or collision, then your caster
is probably correct.

Camber is how much your wheel leans in or out at the top.  On your
Volkswagen, you want them to lean OUT.  Your wheels don't stand perfectly
vertical.  The angle is small, about half a degree, and is checked with a
protractor.  You can make a camber gauge using a plumb-bob and a couple of
shelf brackets.  On ball-joint front-ends camber is adjusted by turning an
eccentric sleeve that holds the upper ball-joint shaft.  On king-pin front
ends camber is adjusted by the link-pin shims.

Toe-in is how much your wheels... toe in.  Just as your front wheels do not
stand perfectly vertical, neither are they perfectly parallel in the
horizontal plane.  The front of the wheels is a little closer together than
the back of the wheels.  Toe-in is adjusted by extending or shortening the
length of the tie-rods, which are fitted with threaded ends and clamps just
for that purpose.

                                  The Do-It-Yourself GOTCHA!

Doing your own maintenance is smart, but when you work on your front end you
may discover that replacing your ball-joints or tie rods renders your vehicle
unsafe to drive because the new parts have thrown your wheels out of
alignment.

Being built-in to the design of your spindles, you can't do very much to
effect your caster but doing your ball-joints or king-pins will throw your
camber out of alignment, while doing your steering box or tie-rod ends will
throw your toe-in out of alignment.

So re-align them. 

You can buy alignment protractors that will allow you to do an acceptable
alignment.  The results won't be as accurate as a job done with the newest
laser-alignment equipment but you should have no trouble returning the front
end to spec -- there's a pretty wide tolerance in the VW front suspension.
 The real GOTCHA! on adjusting the camber of a ball-joint front end is the
need for a special wrench to get at the eccentric sleeve.  With king-pins you
simply add or remove shims to achieve the proper angle.

                                           Toe-in

Toe-in changes as the front suspension wears.  As wear accumulates the
steering will feel loose and your toe-in will vanish, becoming toe-out and
eating up your tires quick like a bunny.

Adjusting toe-in is very easy.  With the vehicle on a level surface, crawl
under and loosen the clamps on the rod-ends of the driver's-side tie rod.  

Using two sticks or two pieces of stiff wire or two of just about anything
that will accurately touch the edge of the wheel's rim, measure the distance
between the wheels, right up near the body at the REAR of the rim.  That is,
you put a notched stick against the edge of the wheel's rim at about the 3
o'clock position, do the same for the other wheel (9 o'clock) and MAKE A MARK
where you two sticks overlap.

Put a chalk-mark on the tire to mark where you took the measurement.  (Spit
works too, if you work fast. And if you're an accurate spitter.)  

Roll the vehicle backwards until the chalk-mark is about 180 degrees from its
original position and measure the distance between the wheels again, this
time at the FRONT.  Use the same pair of sticks, oriented so the original
mark is visible, although your second measurement will probably cover up the
original mark.

Measure the distance between the marks.  If it's between an eighth and a
sixteenth of an inch, it's safe enough to drive.  

To adjust the toe-in, lengthen (or shorten) the tie-rod by turning it, using
a pair of Vise-grips.  Turning the tie-rod toward the front of the car will
lengthen it, increasing the toe in.  Turning it toward the rear will shorten
it, decreasing the toe-in.  

Be cautious when making adjustments.  It takes only a very small change in
tie-rod length to cause a large change in the toe-in.  After changing the
tie-rod length you must repeat the toe-in measurement.  Shoot for a toe-in of
about 1/8&quot; (.125&quot;)  

When satisfied with the toe-in, tighten the tie-rod end clamping nuts.  Have
the front-end professionally aligned as soon as possible.

Any time you alter the tie-rod length or adjust the play in your steering
gear box, check that the steering wheel spoke is horizontal when the wheels
are straight ahead.  This is important since it effects the self-canceling
feature of your turn signals.

If the spoke is not horizontal, make it so by adjusting the length of BOTH
tie rods.  Lengthening the one while shortening the other will cause the
steering wheel spoke to move up, reversing the procedure causes it to move
down.  By lengthening/shortening the rods in small, equal increments, when
you have the steering wheel spoke horizontal the necessary toe-in adjustment
should be quite small and should not disturb the steering wheel alignment.

When you have your front end professionally aligned, make a point of
mentioning the steering wheel spoke orientation.  A lot of shops  don't
bother to do the job right unless they know the customer is aware of what
needs to be done.

                                        Sermonette

Like all other parts on your early Volkswagen, the steering and alignment are
inherently quite simple, far less complex than on front-wheel drive cars.
 The Bentley manual does a good job of explaining the front end geometry, and
it's difficult to get things so out of whack as to make the vehicle unsafe to
drive.  Once you understand the principles involved, maintaining your front
end is no more difficult than maintaining any other part of your vehicle.

                                         Warning

My youngest Volkswagen is a 1970 Karmann Ghia.  The instructions above work
perfectly well for 1970-and-older vehicles but may not apply to younger
machines.  If you have a Super Beetle these instructions will not apply at
all.
