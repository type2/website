Subject: Looking for a laptop loan...

Howdy,

I had planned on having a laptop to bring with me to Inuvik, in order to
send dispatches back to the inuvik web page daily.  (I've already bought a
digital camera.)  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the laptop from my
company will arrive in time for the trip.

If anyone has a laptop in their closet that they'd loan me for a few months,
I would very much appreciate it.  It doesn't have to be terribly powerful...
the laptop only needs the following minimum capabilities:

     o  Windows 3.1 or Windows 95
     o  Either a PCMCIA (PC Card) slot or a 14.4 or faster modem
     o  A serial port (for the camera)
     o  A battery with a few hours' life
     o  Hard drive with several meg free

Ideally this would be a 486 system, but even a 386 would be okay.  I need
the system for word processing, procesing the pictures, connecting to
Compuserve or AOL, and that's it.

If you do have a system you can spare but you're not in the San Francisco
Bay Area, I'll pay FedEx postage and insurance to Cupertino and back.

Ron
