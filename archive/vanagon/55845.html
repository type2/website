&gt; We'd be grateful if someone (our VW mechanic can't help) could tell us
&gt; about 88 Vanagon powerlocks. Ours cycle on, lock and immediately
&gt; unlock at the same time. We checked the fuses; unable to indentify
&gt; which relay controls the locks. Anybody know?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

I've read reports that this condition is actually caused by moisture
and/or corrosion within the lock assemblies.  I have not experienced
this myself, but I've read responses in the past that indicated the need
to crack open the doors and do some cleaning/drying.  While you're in
there, check the wiring on the drivers' door.  Might as well start with
the drivers actually.  The wiring between that door and the body
(through that little boot near the bottom of the door)
corrodes/wears/tears the fastest since that door gets more use.  It
might need some work, and you might as well if you're going to be in
there anyway.
