So Thom with-sand-between-his-ears Fitzpatrick says:

&gt; Send me pix of the most beat up, chopped, channeled, rusted, beat up,
&gt; down and out busses you can find, and I'll put them on the page.

Hmmm.... Well, there's Pick-n-Pull for starters...

If you're just going for but ugly, well just open up any VW T &amp; A
mag and turn to the sections marked &quot;Sano&quot;.  ;)

Otherwise, I don't dare go to the parts of town where you'd find
the most hideous things rolling down the bull-o-vard.  ;)
(Night time ain't time to be in this here neighborhood...)
