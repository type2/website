&gt;&gt;My other question is about the curtains.  I really would like to give
&gt;&gt;them a good cleaning but am concerned about unscrewing the fabric from
&gt;&gt;the wall.  Will it ruin the fabric? Does anyone have any other
&gt;&gt;suggestions?

We just unscrewed ours and threw them and their little straps in the
wash. Do your self a favor and make a sketch so you remember which
curtains go where. I spent a good half hour figuring it out (rather
recreational actually, like a mind teaser). Also, the covers for the pad
over the engine and the pads in the above bunk will come off as well.
Only trick is getting them back on the pads. With patience it will
happen. Washing all this stuff (and replacing the original carpet)
greatly improved the aroma of our van. Now I just need to replace the
rotting skylight.
