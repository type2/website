Is it true that vw buses were
manufactured in mexico, in the eighties, and were type II's?
Do they have upright motors, and in that respect similar to the 71's.
or did i just get my leg pulled a few inches....

If this is so,
are these buses legal on the streets in the us?

signed,
walkin around in circles with one long leg.
