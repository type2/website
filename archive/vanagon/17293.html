&gt; And, well Jonathon, what do you think? Do they make a positive impression? 
&gt; KYB don't make Gas-A-Justs for the front of Vanagons, do they?

They are just a bit better than the stock ones.  We had the stock ones for
over 100K miles.  I don't know if KYB ever makes Gas-A-Justs for any vehicle's
fronts.  We have gotten KYBs for my sister's golf, my rabbit truck and my
brother's volvo.  All fronts were GR2s and the rears Gas-A-Justs.  Don't know
why that is.

I assume there is a difference in the two models.  I replaced the front ones
on my truck after 50K miles (put in Boge Turbogas to support my autocross
habit).  I am still using the KYBs on the rear.  They seem to hold up well.

BTW, my truck turned over 175K miles today!
