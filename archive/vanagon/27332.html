Subject: passing on barndoor in Miami


I got a friend in Florida to go by &amp; take a few (not very good)
photos of the barndoor bus in Miami.  The owner says it is a '54,
but it has a speedo with 0mph at 2 o'clock, which according to my
info dates it at '53 or earlier.

Asking price is $1500, a MAJOR PROJECT.  Has been sitting outside,
uncovered, missing many windows for years.  RUSTY.  Dented nose,
bondo, etc.  Piano hinge rusted off at engine lid (3 haspes hold
it on).

If anyone REALLY wants a barndoor &amp; is willing to spend $$$$ (more
likely $$$$$) to restore this one, I can send pics.

Too much work for me...  wouldn't be prudent at this juncture...
hic...
