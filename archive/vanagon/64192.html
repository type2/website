Subject:      Radiator removal?

     Hi,
        My name's Ian Brown, and I live in Guelph, Ontario.  I've owned a
     water cooled Vanagon since '87.  I've replaced lotsastuff over the
     years and now the radiator has blown a huge leak.  I can't get it out.
      The spare wheel retaining spring rod thingies are held captive at one
     end inside a piece of closed box metal such that I can't even see the
     ends let alone undo them.  The other ends of these curved metal rods
     form the pins for the hinges of the spare wheel carrier.  They are
     rusted in place.  Is it worth trying to get them out?  What do I do
     then to remove the radiator(s)?

        Thanks in advance for any advice.

        Ian Brown.
