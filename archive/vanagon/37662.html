True story: there's a guy driving a '94/'95 EV around here in S.F. with copies 
of press releases all over the windows slamming the &quot;no bumper&quot;, &quot;bad gas-tank 
placement&quot;, and many other &quot;unsafe&quot; items about the bus. Big ole &quot;LEMON&quot;  
stickers all over the place. I guess he's supposed to be informing the public. 
Anyhow, I've seen the van for about a year and what I can't figure out is: If 
the van is so bad and unsafe, why is he still driving it around? Go figure.;)

I'm new to this list and VW Westies, but plan on buying one in about a year. The 
info on this list is better than any mag or press-release! Also, what's up with 
the new Westy's big nose? Has the engine been moved?
