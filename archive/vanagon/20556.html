To All:

The real story behind the NASA film clip from the '60's is the rumor NASA
circulated about changing the fuel of the Saturn V first-stage to magnesium
powder/diesel oil instead of kerosene.  This served to draw VW owners from
across the country.

The raised position of the camper roofs is of course nothing more than
canopus erectus and indicates a state of heightened... umm awareness?
