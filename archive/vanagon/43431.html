Subject: Squeaks/grinds

Hi, peoples....

I have another set of silly questions....My '81 Westy makes some interesting 
noises...one of them, a rapid-time squeak, which can be heard when passing by a 
wall, and gets louder in turns....and it seems to be coming from the 
front....wheel bearings?

The other....a grind, also wheel-related...sounds almost exactly like the sound 
the deep space probe made in that Star Trek where they saved whales..._dot_can be 
heard/felt only when rounding a corner at decent speed....CV joints?

Well, thanks.....

Gene
