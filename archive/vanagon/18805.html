&gt;Steve...I understand your parents used to make you wear a paper bag
&gt;over your head whenever you were in close proximity to them, so I
&gt;guess you can speak from experience!  ;-)
&gt;BTW....your parents have not sent me the check this month for
&gt;being nice to you!!

awww, you are both so ugly ...
... you have to sneak up on a faucet to get a drink of water!
... your momma slaps your daddy every time she looks at you!
... you need TWO paper bags on your heads (in case the first bag tears)!
... even a possum won't eat your garbage!
... you could knock the Teflon off a skillet!
... your parents had to close all the curtains at night so the Moon could
      come out!
... your parents wouldn't let you have a pet dog ... cause it kept trying
      to bury you!

etc., etc., etc., etc. :)

gee. is it Friday yet?? ;)
