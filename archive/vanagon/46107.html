that should have read

&quot;I seem to recall seeing ad's from VW back in the 60's that touted the virtue of 
the Beetles in Antarctica. I seem to recall that they were used by the 
Australian Research Station and had &quot;license plates&quot; on the like &quot;Australia 1&quot; 
etc.

Sorry for the typo listees.

&gt; That is correct I seem to recall seeing adverts from the 60's touting the 
&gt; merits of the beetle back in the 60's.
