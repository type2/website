Subject: Westy roof add-on to Syncro
Date: Wed, 23 Apr 1997 09:55:34 -0500

Thanks to the list I have a revised mission.  I will be adding a westy
roof (from a locally found wrecked '80 Westy) to my 86 GL Syncro.  My
problem now is what to do with the A/C tunnel currently attached to my
existing roof???  Should I cut two holes leaving the A/C tunnel intact
(desired), or remove the tunnel entirely?  I would love to hear from
those of you who have made this type of conversion.  How does the latch
attach, how does the canvas attach etc...
