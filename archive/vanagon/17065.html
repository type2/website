First off, you should replace all 4 exhaust valves together.  The manual
I use says that they should never be reused, unless they are sodium filled
in which case they can be reused one time.  The seats should be reground
so there will be a nice smooth surface for the new valves to seat against.
If you absolutely can't get the seats ground, then at least lap the valves
really well.  Standard disclaimers apply...
