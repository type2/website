Ok, so you've decided to read this!

My SO was having problems with her BMW, a '78 530i, which was running kinda
ruff and not getting very good mileage, etc.

I played with it for a while, yanking on all the little Fool Injection
connectors &amp; stuff, but couldn't figger it out.

She took it to a shop, (also to find an oil leak) and it turns out it was
a cracked distributor cap!  (ended up costing $45 all told, for the cap,
and the little sender dealy that was  leaking, and labor)

I'm positive that this could also apply to VW's, so pack this little gem
of info away somewhere!
