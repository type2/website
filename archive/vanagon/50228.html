I have an insurance question for the many gurus of this list.

When shopping around for insurance carriers, most brokers ask if you have had
any wrecks.

My question is: how do I answer this question?

I have had a wreck, but if it does not show up in someone's database, I don't
want to admit it to a new insurance company.  God knows, they're gonna ream me
enough with regular premiums, I don't want to give them an excuse to screw me
for more.

My insurance co just declined to renew my policy, I think because of my recent
wreck in which they had to pay out more than the book value of the van.
 Bastards.  Anyhow, now I have to search for a new company.

Should I lie or tell the truth?

Thanks for any input.
