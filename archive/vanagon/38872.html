Hi,

I work with the E-mail systems and have been noticing a large amount of
mailing-list activity from vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu.  The problem is, all of
it seems to be going through mhub1.tc.umn_dot_edu rather than being evenly
distributed amongst all of our relay.tc.umn_dot_edu systems.  Are you hardcoding
the mhub1.tc.umn_dot_edu host in any of your configuration files?  If so, could
this be changed to relay.tc.umn_dot_edu?  Not only will it provide you and others
with better E-mail service, but it will also prevent breakage in the event
that the mhub1.tc.umn_dot_edu is down or out of service for any reason.

Thank you in advance.
