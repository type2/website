Subject: Wasserboxer Leaky Heads


G'day all

I've been doing some research regarding the leaking heads of the 
wasserboxer. I cant stand a mystery!

I talked to the biggest (only?) VW dealer in Perth and they dont know 
anything about the leaking head gasket problems, it seems it doesn't 
happen in Western Australia?

Drawing from my Mech Engineering backgroud, corrosion in automotive 
cooling systems is caused by;

&quot; Dissimilar metals in contact with one another through an electrolyte.&quot;

The system creates a Galvanic cell with a discharge of electricity and 
the more reactive of the metals becomes a sacrificial anode and is 
eaten (corroded) away.

The Facts?
1. The wasserboxer is ENTIRLY aluminiun alloy.
2. They all seem to have corrosion inhibitor.

So;
1. Is the Head Gasket itself causing the corrosion?
2. Is the Head a different composition alloy than the Block?
3. Is there some other metal in the cooling system that could cause the 
problem?
4. Have a large number of US wasserboxers been filled with the WRONG 
coolant?
5. Is there some correlation between VERY COLD (&gt;-10C) operation and 
subsequent Head leaks? (causing Head bolt loosening?)

This REALLY bugs me as I have owned 12 year old cast iron block alloy 
head vehicles and seen NO corrosion on disassembly.

If you have any ideas or info that I can compile I would be greatfull.
