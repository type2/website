Subject: Re: Porsche 914 chassis alignment

&gt;&gt; It seems to me, not that we need any more traffic, that someone should
&gt;&gt; invite all the 914 folks to be on this list since they share the same motor
&gt;&gt; as the 72-79s.

&gt;I don't think so, join thier list.  I have a hard enough time keeping up 
&gt;with the VW lists.
&gt;
&gt;Aren't you the Derek Drew that was complaing about excessive traffic when 
&gt;you were on AOL?

I feel red in the face (with embarrassment).

All points well taken. 

As for the 914 folks, I guess if they are smart enough they will joint the
list anyway. 

But for that matter, if there is or there comes into existance a 914 list
then all 72-79 vans on our list might want to consider inflitrating the new
914 list just to hear about engine goodies.

But I haven't heard of any 914 lists and I bet any other porche lists that
exist don't have a good enough signal to noise ratio to make it worth while
to join. 

Speaking of signal to noise ratio, I think this thread I started is pushing it.
