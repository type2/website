Subject: Replacing Canvas and Heater Cables
Date: Wed, 29 Nov 95 10:38:22 PST

  I've been spending a good portion of my profit sharing check on VW parts.
  What better thing to do with a windfall, right? I've ordered new canvas
  for the pop top and new heater cables. I have no experience installing 
  either of these items and I'd like to ask the list for advice, things
  to watch out for, tricks, etc... Has anyone done these tasks with good
  results?
