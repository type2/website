NO! I don't have any stickers available right now, so please don't send an
order, unless you don't mind waiting a few months for more. It costs a few
hundred bucks to print a batch, and I am pretty much broke right now building
an engine. I'm not sure why the offer is current in the archives, but it's
definately not. I may do some in a few months, but in the meantime, Ken Hooper
has printed up some cool stickers of a different design. So, if you want some
of my design, just sit tight. In the meantime, to soothe that jones, buy a
couple from Ken. Here's all that info:

The stickers are purple ink over chrome Mylar. The lettering resembles the
T-shirt and is &quot;reversed&quot;, so the stickers look purple while the lettering
looks silver. These have a coating over them to preserve the ink and keep
the chrome from being so glossy that it's obnoxious. Permanent adhesive,
they're designed to be mounted on the exterior lower left corner of your
rear window. Panel drivers will have to improvise.

I said originally that these would be oval like the v_at_l stickers but it
looks like they'll be more circular instead. Take a look at the artwork and
you'll understand why.

Stickers are $2 each, includes shipping in US.

Here's the design:

Anyway, sorry about the confusion. I'll print up more eventually, but these
should hold folks til then...
