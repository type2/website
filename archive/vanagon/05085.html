GatorMail-Q                   RE&gt;Was: YES:6-ply tires, what about 15&quot; wheels
On 10/6/94, Frank E. Terhaar-Yonkers suggests:

&gt;This has probably been beaten to death also, but what about 86ing the
&gt;damn 14&quot; wheels and going to 15&quot;?  The tire options for 15&quot; are at least
&gt;10x ...

&gt;As long as the bolt pattern AND offset are correct it'll work okay.
&gt;I don't think there will be a clearance problem in the wheel well.
&gt;The speedo will be off, but that can be dealt with also.

In terms of performance, this would seem to be a logical choice.  If the
&quot;average&quot; 14&quot; tire being discussed in this thread is a 195/75R/14 mounted
on 14x5.5 or 14X6 rims, then a Plus-1 setup would result in something along
the lines of a 205/65R/15 mounted on, say, 15x6 or 15x6.5 rims.

The benefits would be reduced sidewall flex, and a slightly larger contact
patch (oh, yeah, and increased tire selection).  I don't think the overall
ride would be too harsh (let's see, 205x0.65=133.25mm =&gt; ~5.25&quot; of sidewall,
which should still yield a pretty comfortable ride)

I'm not sure that the speedo would be that far off; who's to say that speedo
error isn't greater with the OEM setup vs a plus-1 or plus-2 setup?  The 
important thing is to have the OD of the tire match as close as possible to 
the speedo calibration.

Of course, one reason to stay with 14&quot; wheels would be if you had a set of
those $$$ factory alloys that everyone's lusting after...
