Subject: Electric Heaters

	What's the skinny on a recommendable 12V electric heater that can
be wired in somewhere under the dash? I seem to dimly remember a friend
having one some years back, which had a little blower fan in it. Make? Model?
I'm running a '72 Bus with '78 engine, but I guess the wiring is '72.
