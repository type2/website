&gt; The movie &quot;The Great Race&quot; (Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood, Jack Lemmon)

&gt; Are you saying that there really was such a race in real life?

&gt; VW Content:  A splittie woulda left them all in the dust. And its 6:1

YES the movie was &quot;loosely&quot; based on the real race.  The Great Leslie's car
in the movie was probably the only thing close to the real thing.  A 1910
Thomas Flyer with an 800 cubic inch, 60hp inline 6-cylinder (figure it out,
the pistons were huge!).  I saw the actual car at Harrah's Auto collection
in Reno about 20 years ago.  They had taken the fenders and top off to
lighten the car, and the wooden body panels had the driver's and crew's
names carved all over it.  Was pretty darned cool!
