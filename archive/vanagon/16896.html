&gt;before. For the next 37k miles, I have put up with the awful black dust on
&gt;my nice allow wheels. :-(

i fear that's the price of non-squeeking brake pads. check out the front
wheels of porsches, mercedes, etc. :(

&gt;maybe I will change the pads this time, especially if you guys can tell me a
&gt;good brand/type of pad to buy that wont garf up my wheels and will not
&gt;squeek excessively.

unfortunately, i haven't found one that doesn't squeek much worse than the
vw pads. i tried some Repco pads (from Imparts, in st. louis) and they
squeeked and squeeled something fierce. i tried some El Cheapo from the
local FLAPS and they messed up the surface of my rotor and STILL squeeled.
so now, i've gone back to the vw pads and their high prices. :(

no recommendation. just my story.
