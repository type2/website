&gt;        My neighbour's 82 aircooled Westy has an elevated idle
&gt;speed (~1000 rpm) but otherwise runs perfectly.  
&gt;
&gt;        The idle is not affected by the bypass adjustment screw.  
&gt;The idle will drop down if I temporarily physically starve the air 
&gt;supply with my hand, leading me to believe that the butterfly 
&gt;valve on the throttle is worn sufficiently so as to allow too much 
&gt;air to pass by it, even when in closed position at idle speed.
&gt;
&gt;        Am I on the right track?  Is this part available anywhere
&gt;other than VW?  Is there anything else I should know?
&gt;
&gt;        Thanks.

Yes!  The idle speed stabilizer is advancing the timing whle you are
adjusting the idle spped.  Insuffeien tair flow will cause excessive
emissions while idling.  Timing and idle speed adjustments must be done with
the stabilizer dissconected. It is the liitle black box along side the
ignition module.  Disconect the two connectors and connect them together to
bypass the unit.
