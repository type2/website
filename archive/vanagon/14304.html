So Kevin out-of-the-lurker-closet says:
&gt; 
&gt; Without painfully beating a rather tired horse I should fess up
&gt; and admit to being an active voyeur.vanagon.sic.( puppy ) but
&gt; add to my defense by saying that &quot;I am recovering....&quot; and intend
&gt; from this point forward to participate more openly (and as time
&gt; permits) in the dissapation of the myth that all VW partners are
&gt; either going to college or coming from a faculty meeting..

I think it's really great that the lurkers are speaking.  I don't
think that was Joel's original intent, but it's nice to get some
new blood in the discussion.  Thanks for writing Kevin.

&gt; 
&gt; 65 SingleCab (Currently for-sale) partial resto...
How much?  And where?

&gt; 69 Beetle (cat house and outdoor closet)
What a shame...
&gt; 69 Beetle (Daughter's resto-project lifelong thingie)
Kudo's to your daughter.
&gt; 69 Beetle (Just turned up in our yard one morning)
Kinda like the cats?  ;)
&gt; 74 412 (12k orig miles, ebersparcher sparked, spooked prev. owners)
These are getting to be quite rare.  Especially with the gas heater.
I'd like to snag one before they disappear altogether.
Now if I could just find a place to put these toys.  ;)

Cheers!
