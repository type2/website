Subject: Re: Cool Auction Score!

I bought a VW air-conditioner at an auction for $6 last septembr.  I could
of had it for less, but it was being sold in conjunction with roll of
visqueen.   Such is life.   It was sealed in a box (used) and isn't what
i'd hoped.  It looks like it mounts to a type IV engine. Anybody want/need
it?  Free.  (Plus shippeing)
