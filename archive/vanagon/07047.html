Subject: Hate to do this, but....

Well,

It looks like it has come time for me and my buddy poncho to part 
company.  I no longer have a place where I can work on him, and my 
commute is getting longer and longer, so...  If anyone is interested:

Poncho- 1970 VW Transporter:

Body straight, no major rust, paint in good condition(light blue, white top)
Newly upholstered westfalia interior(fold out bed and jump seat), no 
fridge or stove.
Newly rebuilt 1600 dual port engine(rebuilt by a mechanic I more than trust)
New brakes(meaning turned rotors, new pads, rebuilt master cylinder).

Have reciepts for work done.

I also have the original interior(the two bench seats), Muirs book, the 
Chilton book for this year range, some assorted parts, jack stands, 
timing light, tachometer, etc. that I will gladly add.

Asking $4200.

If interested, please email sequoia_at_halcyon_dot_com

thanks

Jon
