Subject: FWD: 90 Westfalia for sale in Texas


If you are seriously in the market for a beautiful white 90 Westfalia GL
with only 51K on it, go check this out at:

www.blackhills_dot_com/al

or email the owner at:


aferguso_at_brazosport.cc.tx_dot_us



He's asking $17.9K.  Maybe if I sold both vans, the Bronco II, and got my
      bonuses for the next few years in advance...



Happy hunting; usual disclaimers.

Karl

88 GL

86 Westfalia GL
