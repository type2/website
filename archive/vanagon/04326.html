Subject:      HELP!!! GD VW place wants my blood...

I dropped off the van this morning to ask them to rotate, balance and align
the tires. I also asked them to check brakes and a noise in the right front
wheel. They just hit me on the phone. Eighty bucks for the stuff I dropped it
off for, and they told me about the following:

FRONT:

Wheel bearings shot (I presume only Right front)
Machine front rotors

BACK:

Machine rear drums (slippage at pedal?)
replaces shoes and wheel cylinder

NOW, the moment we all know, when that wave of nausea comes over you...

COST OF PROPOSED WORK:

VW parts &amp; labor

R-F Wheel bearing  (all numbers are US dollars)  153.04
                                         Seal     27.84
                                         labor   127.50
                               rotors  machined   81.60

Rear brake shoes        76.32
labor                   76.50


Rear Wheel cylinders (2)  parts  142.56
labor                             76.50

clean brakes           parts(?)    6.00

Machine rear brake drums          labor 30.00

TOTAL W/ Orig. Equip.  = 771.36

OR he faxed, they can use aftermarket parts with 90 day warranty for

parts    205.00
labor    346.00
machine rotors   30.00

Aftermarket total   =  581.00


Now my Qs:

I believe this to be quite high, can any brick owners (mine is 1985 by the way)
 think of any reasone the dealer should do these jobs, can they be trusted else
where?  I have never worked on the van so my confidence in my abilities is
limited.  I do have bently though.  Any thoughts?  If they're involved, send me
 a phone number and I'll call (my nickel)...if that is... it's more convenient.
  Thanks in advance!
