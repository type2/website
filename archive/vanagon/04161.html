&gt;I would like this info also as well as the gopher site.

ok, what is supposed to work is:
send mail to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu   with one line of text:
set vanagon mail digest

and the Gopher site is     halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu, look in Miscellaneous/Vanagon

if the digest thing doesn't work (give it a little while to start 'digesting'
you), contact Gerry  (or me) and it'll maybe get fixed late at night when the
workload gets low. :)
