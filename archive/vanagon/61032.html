I thought about it, but cannot fund the project.  Below is a complete vr6
in PA that I posted a while back.  I dunno if he still has it.  I think it
mounts up the same as an upright VW 4 cyl.  You'd probably have to modify
the oil pan.   I think the one below is complete with all the accessories.

I have a low mileage VR6 engine for sale.  If interested, please contact
me at jrjones_at_ptd_dot_net

I am located in PA.  The engine is low mileage (out of a '95 Passat...the
car went to the junkyard in mid '95).  I am asking $1750 (what I paid for
it) but will entertain any *reasonable* offers.

Josh
