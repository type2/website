michael,

There aren't that many *really* nice busses down here in Atlanta either.
I think any split window that you can drive is a good one though.

Here's a few descriptions of my friends busses.  My main competitor for
the most busses is Allen Becker.  He is the leader of the local chapter
of NEATO (if you are a NEATO member you may have seen his picture in the
last issue of the Old Bus Review &quot;recruiting&quot; new members).  He has a
'56 standard that is a real project.  His pride &amp; joy is his '58 standard
which is in amazing unrestored shape.  It's only problems are a torn
front seat cover and some slight rust at the battery tray.  He also has
a '64 standard that he bought from the original owner for $100.  The bus
is complete but currently disassembled awaiting funds to be repainted.
He has a '67 21 window with very little rust that we are currently trying
to find a middle seat for.  He has a '68 Crew Cab that is in really good
shape.  We went to Busses by the Arch this year in it.  He also has '71
&amp; '75 Westfalias and a '73 Thing.

Tim Humphries has a '63 Crew Cab which he has had for a couple of years.
He finally got it painted this summer &amp; it looks much better than it did.
(should have spent a few more bucks on body work though.)

Gotta go now.  Fill you in on more later
