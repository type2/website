Subject: Cams

Here's a little trip I got at the VW shop:
I need a new cam for the engine for my bus, and the mail order was out of 
them.  I went down to the bug shop, and heres what he told me.
50-60 bucks for a new one.  We got talking and he said that they regrind the 
lobes, ie less lift=less flow=less power=unhappy camper.  Also the camshafts 
are hardened, which means you get softer metal on a wearing surface!  All 
this would be just blowing hot air, but one of the lobes on my old cam is 
worn off about .052&quot;!!  Thas right y'know about 1/16&quot;- you can easily see it 
with the eye.  I don't know about you, but a *new* cam with my rebuild is 
imminent. I want that puppy to last.
BTW- I was looking in the bus stop's cat. the pictures on pg 34-35 are photo 
negatives of each other!  Someone should call them and say &quot;yes thats right, 
I want a engine with the generator on the *left* side the distributor on the 
*right*.

Just too many cruel thoughts-
