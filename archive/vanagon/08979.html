Subject: Locking Reserve tap [was: Bus Woes - Part II]


Ric writes on the vanagon list:
&gt; Do you still have a functioning reserve tap? I leave my '56 bug
&gt; on the &quot;off&quot; position (even when I have the shifter locked) when
&gt; I park it in a strange place.
&gt; 
&gt; I figure that not too many people know about the old reserve tap...
&gt; and within an 1/8th of a mile or so the car runs out of gas.

Has anyone ever made a key-locking version of the reserve tap?  I
imagine it wouldn't be too tough to do.  Just use a multi-position key
lock from something like a ski-rack and weld on the reserve tap
handle/pipe thingy.  For that matter, aren't there fuel line cut off
valves that are available? 

I still like chaining the front axle to a telephone pole with a big
ass industrial strength chain.
