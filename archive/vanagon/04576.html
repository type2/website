&gt; &gt; 	I agree. I've tried to convince my sister to go thie above route.
&gt; &gt; 	But, like most buyers, she's dazzled by the Previa's shape, meaning
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, it's amazing how people are easily seduced by a sleezy looking
&gt; car and never think of the practical side.  I'm guilty of this.  Sometimes
&gt; I'd like to just trade in the Westy and get a 911, but the practical 
&gt; side always seems to win out.  And I can't afford both.  Besides that,
&gt; If I get a third car, it'll have to be a pick-up.
&gt; 

	Steven, weren't you the person I was sort of sparing about the
	vitrues of VW, recently?

	Hah! We're in a similar place as the goddesses say....

	I NEED a pickup for my gardening. I'm stuck. No pickup. No
	bricks. No Fertilizer.

	I refuse to haul shit like that in my '91 camper. And, I refuse,
	can not actually, haul that shit in my workcar (93 Escort).

	Less than an hour ago, I took $21,000 for my camper from (2) perfectly
	nice folks from Medford, OR..

	My workcar (Squert) is posted in the local rag.

	By next weekend I'll have that honeywagon!!

	I shall haul shit through the streets!!!!!!!!!!!

	I reluctantly sold my camper. But, where I'm at right now is:
		build garden
		fix house
