BBQ NOTICE

I think I posted late enough that I will not have people from NY showing up 
on my doorstep :)

In honor of Earth day, tomorrow Saturday there will be a festival on the 
National Mall in Wash-DC with bands and protests and everything that makes DC 
great.  

I am having a BBQ for friends at 4pm at 2269 Cathdedral NW. (next to National 
Zoo)  

If you are in town and have a van and know how to get there stop on by.

There should be three vans out front. (big white house)

Main entree and drink will be provided, just bring some side dish 

Badmiton for those physically inept will be provided also
