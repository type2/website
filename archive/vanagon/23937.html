Jonathan,

Be sure to check the valve clearance (engine cold).
Intake:   .15mm (.006 in)
Exhaust:  .15mm (.006 in) to Chassis 2132210554, thereafter, .20mm (.008 in)

You can pretty much tell if the valve seats are okay or not by using a
straightedge across the tops of the valve springs.  If they all line up and
none is higher or lower than the rest, they're probably okay.

And the points gap:  .4mm to .6mm (.016 to .020 in).  (I used to set mine,
when I used points, at .45mm.)  Or, check the dwell angle - new points: 44
to 50 degrees; used points: 42 to 58 degrees.  Check for pitted places on
the points. 
Lightly coat the distributor cam with multi-purpose grease.  Put a few drops
of oil onto the felt pad inside the top of the distributor shaft.  If the
points are pitted, replace them with BOSCH points.  Check the vacuum line to
the distributor for cracks, etc.  If brittle or the ends are loose, replace.
Vacuum line is cheap.  While you're at it, you might check the fuel lines, too.

Check the spark plug wires.  Yoou can get a good idea if they're leaking by
running the engine at night, in the dark, and watching for loose sparks
anywhere they go.

Not knowing what year and number your engine is, I can't be really specific
about ignition timing.  I assume your bus has the standard vacuum-advance
distributor.  Here's the poop from the Haynes manual:

Country       Engine  Suffix    Vacuum Hose   Idle Speed     Setting

USA (manual)   AW       N          on           900      5 degrees after TDC


Otherwise, sounds like you're well on your way.  Good luck\have fun.

Cheese
