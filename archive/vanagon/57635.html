Hey,

For the screen for the rear hatch when open call:

Euro-American RV Products
(818) 760-4214 between 9am - 11am PST or just leave a message.

I don't think he carries the curtains.  Personally, I'm making my own.  I 
got the rods at a junk yard and some old burned curtains for a pattern.

If you have any other Westy needs give him a call.  I went to his 
warehouse and came away highly impressed by his stock.

Good luck,

Perry
