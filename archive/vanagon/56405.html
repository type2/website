Subject: Re: vanagon engine lid

Hi Volks,
   I saw a couple of posts about the differnet engine lids offer on
vanagons thought the years and got to wondering.  Does the heavyer metal
lid block the sound any better than the plastic one?  Kenyon Farely made
a good point about the plastic lid melting in the event of an engine
fire. .  I have both lids right now.  In fact I removed the metel lid
for the lighter palstic lid on my '82 'GTi' camper.  I also thought the
insulation on the plastic lid looked better that the metal one. The
metal lid's had fluffy stuffing like stuff and the Plastic lid is foam. 
I'm looking for more input on this subject.  Thanks. Take care.
