&gt; John,
&gt; 
&gt; the going list-wisdom is &quot;go ahead and do it yourself: you CAN do it.&quot; In
&gt; my case, having it done by someone else wasn't even an option as I'm just
&gt; a (relatively) poor grad student. I, too, live in an apartment and have no
&gt; garage. However, we have a laundry basement, which --at the landlord's and
&gt; the other tenants' dismay-- I turned into a little workshop of horrors. 
&gt; 
&gt; Here is where I do NOT agree with the list's conventional wisdom: your own
&gt; labor is not free and I think you should take this into account. If
&gt; fiddling with your engine means taking off a week from work, then that
&gt; costs. If it means that graduation from school will be postponed by, say,
&gt; a trimestre, that's awefully expensive (think of the forgone earnings)! If
&gt; it means not going on a holiday, that, too, costs. In sum, estimate the
&gt; true value in $$ of your forgone earnings and leisure. (unless, of course,
&gt; fiddling with engines is your idea of a good time...)

gee if i didn't know better i would say the above statement was written by an economist &lt;g&gt; ;)
