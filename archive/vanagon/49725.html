Subject: Jerome meet hits front page news!

I stumbled out side and picked up the paper &lt;Arizonan Republic, Saturday,
September 21, 1996 &gt; to see what the &quot;joy&quot; of the day was. To my surprise
there was a blurb above the headlines that mentioned the event. A half page
article described the event generally OK but seemed to &quot;have to&quot; insert the
cliche' mention of hippies in the '60's, the Dead, and Marijuana. I saw this
as a sign of a journalist who wasn't quite into the scene and drew only on
the typical associations. They did mention the monies gathered for the
childrens burn camp and the family that gathered from several states~!
Hurray! I would post the contents of the article to the list but I dont have
the time and I dont think that you all (y'all) would learn anything from it.
Please refer to my post earlier in the week for the real deal! ;-)
