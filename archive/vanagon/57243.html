Subject: VanBondo sneaks email access for a sec ...

&gt;Hey Troops,
&gt;I snuck a second to send a quickie message on a borrowed account.  I am
&gt;not able to recieve any replies to this message at this time...
&gt;
&gt;All is well in VanBondoland but not swell. I was swept up in a
&gt;&quot;downsizing&quot; and am now searching for new employment and will
&gt;perform the duties within Arizona. I probably will find a way to
&gt;purchase the hardware and software needed to continue on with what I
&gt;know to do and &quot;contract&quot; from the RustyRanch. I have been eye-balling
&gt;the '57 single cab and wondering just how much I could get for it and
&gt;all of the treats that I have for it. I have nearly everything to put it
&gt;back to a stock &quot;pseudo-European.&quot;  Hmmm... box on wheels vs a box on
&gt;the desk.  Tempting, very tempting. True to her spirit Mrs. VanBondo
&gt;said to keep it and figure some other way. &quot;That's my girl!&quot;

&gt;Subject: Replacing bungee cord for the 65-67 Camper curtains
&gt;
&gt;Located several sources for &quot;shock cord&quot; for holding the curtains in
&gt;place. Try tou local hiking and camping places or fabric clearence
&gt;warehouses, or upholstery suppliers. I was unable to locate the stock
&gt;medium gray but found white and black in 3mm and 5mm sizes. At each
&gt;location I requested a one inch sample of the options and attached them
&gt;to the back of thier business card with the price per foot. Typical to
&gt;Phoenix was $0.12-15 per foot depending on the guage and the vendor. I
&gt;chose black after testing what each looked like with dirt and grimey
&gt;fingers rubbed on the samples.
&gt;*What to do about the loop holding &quot;grommets?&quot;*
&gt;No vendor had clue one about the brass like metal clamps that retained
&gt;the &quot;loops&quot; on each end of the stock bungees. I ended up at a fabric
&gt;supplier run by a great Jewish family &quot;from the Olt shuel&quot; (old school).
&gt;No slander or non-PC intended but the scene was very cliche'. =)
&gt;The very wise gentleman advised that I shoult use Zipper stops from
&gt;larger sized zippers. Trust me the smallish metal pieces are available
&gt;separate from the zippers and are small.
&gt;Form a loop in the shock cord, place the zipper stop around the shock
&gt;cord and bend the zipper stop around the end of the loop. The gentleman
&gt;at the store used a pair of needle nossed pliers that had a smallish &quot;U&quot;
&gt;groove machined into one of the blades. The groove provides a roundish
&gt;appearence to the crimped metal &quot;zipper stop.&quot;
&gt;I purchased the appropriate number of stops for about $0.20 each. I
&gt;chose to avoid the silva vunts (silver ones) and chose the brass.  The
&gt;gentleman corrected me and said that they were &quot;golt&quot; (gold) not brass.
&gt;=)
&gt;I thanked the folks appropriately wished them &quot;Shalom.&quot;
&gt;VanBondo will return to the list(s) as soon as I scrounge a computer. I
&gt;feel like a fish (phish?) out of water without one. At least the weather
&gt;is great. 97F in Phoenix today!!!! (Hoo boy, here it comes already.)
&gt;Shalom, (and Happy Easter) to you all as well.
&gt;VanBondo\
