Subject: Re: Cost of Eurovans?

I don't think there's anything wrong with Cetin's approach, except the part
where he offered to let them keep the $100.  When I shop for a new car, I
tell them up front that I can pay what they ask, I just don't want to find
out I could have gotten it for less, from them or anyone else nearby.

When I asked for my deposit back from one guy, he had to go outside to cool
off.  I was shopping for a car for my mom, and the Plymouth dealer across
the highway -- RUN BY THE SAME MGMT -- gave me a better deal by $350.  I
didn't feel a bit apologetic.  (Car was Mitsubishi Colt sold by Dodge and
Plymouth).

Particularly galls me when I go in and they ask how much I want to spend.
Imagine going into a restaurant and being asked that.  I may spend $8850,
I may spend $40k.  Limiting factor is my taste, not my budget.  I'm not
hard to deal with; I make up my mind about what I'll offer a lot faster than
the dealership makes up its mind about what it'll accept.  I you don't
jerk me around, I'll buy your car.  If you try to get an extra couple
hundred bucks that your competitor doesn't, I'll buy HIS car.  What
could be easier?
