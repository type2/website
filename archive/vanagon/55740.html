That's the rubber &quot;heater&quot; booster boot.  I finally put a new one on 
several months ago and it went on a lot easier than the old one, 
certainly because it was more flexible.  The only &quot;trick&quot; I know is to 
stick your left arm into the engine compartment through the hole behind 
the license plate.  That way you can get some &quot;downward&quot; tub on the boot 
in order to slip it over the alternator housing.
