Subject: re: exhaust clamps

Does anyone know if the muffler brackets on a 87 vanagon are
availiable? I dont need the whole thing, just the top straps, and
according to bentley, these are replaceable?

Yes, my '88 had new ones put on at the dealer when I bought it in 
March. Didn't pay for 'em so I don't know about cost though.
