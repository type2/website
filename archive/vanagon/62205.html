Thanks for all the suggestions :-)

Regarding my electrical problem when wet weather comes my way.

this problem has been around for quite some time, in fact the first time I
took the van for a tune up, they charged me $60.and didn't (couldn't)
complete it, they said I didn't have an o2 sensor so they couldn't adjust
it.

I said whatttttttt, when the exhaust system was last replaced, the new pipe
didn't have a spot for a sensor, so guess you must not need one was the
prev. owners Idea!!!.

I bought a sensor, drilled the hole in the right spot, ran the wire (every
one keeps mentioning wires? is this not just a one wire thing?) to the
waiting, freshly cleaned connector, and the stupid thing still did the cut
n go when the weather was bad.

I know the o2 wire isn't frayed or shorting, I will check the connections,
although one would think that if the problem was a bad connection and water
got on it wouldn't that make a good connection(thinking this is the reason
why people are killed by the radio falling in the tub) and be a vise versa
problem?

I might just change the plug wires, and the coil wire, but the cap has no
cracks and was just replaced, I still have the old nice and clean looking
one.(and the problem still shows when going through the wet)

On the last tune up(from a different place)o2 level was checked and
adjusted, now the van gets about 550km per tank of gas, it was getting
about 350km before.
(bosch parts were used both times)
(will try the mister bottle on the electrical hoping not to get a shock)

Thanks for all the help
