'85 converted camper. Bought used in '88 with 42k, now has 120k. Heads
started leaking at 65k. Now a firm believer in BarsLeak; now only an
occasional drip rom the right head. Replaced water pump twice and had
the power steering rack rebuilt. Besides the normal wear items I had
to clean the wiper in the air flow meter.

With fingers crossed,

Steve
