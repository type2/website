Subject: [f] Does anyone else have this problem?

My son celebrates his second birthday on 03Mar... 
Whenever we get ready to go anywhere, he starts raising a FUSS, and
starts yelling `BUS! BUS! BUS, DADDY!', and will have a fit if
we don't go in the bus. I think it's because he gets to sit in the 
front passenger seat (He's still in a carseat, and the two front
seats are the only ones with seatbelts right now.) but any other
theories are invited.
