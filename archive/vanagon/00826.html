Subject: westfalia restoration articles from HOT VWs

Crazy Coincidence!
Just signed up yesterday, looking for some info on putting my '70 camper back
together after a 3-year hiatus, and there's all this talk on resoration
articles!

I have Part 2-6 but am missing Part 1. Someone like to swap?
BTW, I don't think there was a part 7.

And people thought I was crazy for saving issues of Hot VW's!
