Subject:      Vanagon CV joints

Hello all, I'm looking for some expert advice.

My job for the weekend is to finish replacing my axles on my 84 Westie.  I
had one real clunker and a couple of more that were pretty loose so I decided
to get rebuilt axle assemblies , Pep Boys - Neapco Brand - $139 each plus $67
core charge per axle assembly.   Finally got them in store but they do not
&quot;Roll&quot; nicely.  In otherwords, if I tilt the coupling on the end of the CV to
the maximum (or some intermediate) angle with the shaft and then try rolling
the joint around it binds and will not roll on around.  Two of the 4 joints
are like this, a third arrived with the balls rolling around in the box and I
have not yet reassembled it.

So the question is: Is this to be expected in a newly machined CV joint and
could I probably expect them to &quot;wear in&quot; ok thru these tight spots or is
this behavior evidence that they mismatched the ball tolerances to the
machined slots?   BTW, one axle arrived with grease in the assembly and extra
CV grease pouches and the other joint arrived bone dry, no grease.  I have a
dry and a greased joint that have the hitch in the rolling action.

Whats the consensus?  Was I robbed?  Should I return the axles to Manny, Moe
and Larry for a refund?  Should I give up on this project and shop for a new
EV camper?  Should I take up robbing 7-11s to pay for same?

Thanks,
