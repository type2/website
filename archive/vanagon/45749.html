&gt; does anyone remember the story about how you can make &quot;emergency diesel
&gt; fuel&quot; from gasoline mixed with motor oil??
&gt; 
&gt; i recall one of the vw magazines took a diesel into mexico and couldn't
&gt; find any diesel fuel, so they mixed 30w motor oil with gasoline to the
&gt; ratio of 1 liter of oil to 5 liters of gasoline (?? not sure of that)
&gt; and came on home. changed the oil, and the bus kept running ever after
&gt; without trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway that's how i remember it, but i am NOT sure of that ratio. anybody
&gt; know better??
&gt; =====================
&gt; 
&gt; Before I got that desperate, how about any of the following alternate fuels:
&gt; Kerosene
&gt; Aviation Jet fuel
&gt; Heating oil
Around here, heating oil *is* diesel fuel (without the extra taxes, 
of course) The local Shell distributor pumps heating oil &amp; diesel out 
the *same* tank.
A few neighbors I know have been known to retain their oil tanks 
after switching to natural gas furnaces at home. Funny thing is I 
never see them with their diesel pickups at the gas station.... 
hmmm.... :)
