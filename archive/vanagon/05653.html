&gt;I have a question about the heat exchangers on a '71 bus.  I don't plan
&gt;on buying them from JCWhitney but I was looking at their catalog last
&gt;night.  They had them for $79 each for the '71 bus through the July
&gt;production dates.  The remainder of the '71s they want $199 each.  I
&gt;know my bus was made in November.  What gives with the price
&gt;difference?  Can I assume that other/better sources for them will have
&gt;similar price differences?  If cost is no factor (hahaha) who makes
&gt;the best ones?

i think they are referring to the changeover of the model year ... vw used
to change in july-august, so any buses made in august of 1971 are actually
the 1972 models (with the type 4 engine ... which has very different heat
exchangers). you bus would have been made in november of 1970, in order to
be a 1971 model.

the price ($79) sounds about right ... i think. seems like Rocky Mountain
(Bus Stop) wanted about the same thing for theirs.  their catalog is really
worth getting, by the way. some really neat stuff in there.

&lt;oh, momma, can this really be the end?
 to be stuck in Tusk-a-loosa with the Memphis blues again?&gt;
