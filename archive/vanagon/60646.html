Do not despair! There are a few of us out here who greatly appreciate your
words of wisdom (&quot;The Hoover Sermons&quot;). Unfortunately, it is the populace
that expects everyone and everything else will compensate them for their
idiocy and stupidity that tarnishes those sincere efforts to pass on a few
good words of wisdom. All the sage advice one can receive cannot replace
&quot;thinking&quot; for oneself.

I sincerely encourage you to continue with your &quot;sage advice&quot;. Your
comments would surely be missed.

With regard to deciphering intelligent questions from the flak via the
list, we will be attempting to lay some ground rules for proper use of the
subject line in vanagon list email. More so to aide us in categorizing
responses that will be archived. This should be incoporated into the
vanagon list when we complete the host site changeover next month. Perhaps
Ken will attempt the same with the TYPE2 list. I'll touch base with Ken
again about this issue.
