Subject: Re: change list to newsgroup?

I like the idea of a newsgroup.  That way when I go away for the weekend 
I don't have 250 new mail messages waiting for me.  I can easily browse 
a newgroup and look at the threads to see if I am interested.  I think 
that is a major reason why people join a list, get way too many messages 
and then decide to be removed after seeing how much traffic it 
generates.  

I don't know any of the technical reasons on why one is better than 
another or what is involved in administration....

I suppose a list prevents alot of SPAM and unwanted junk mail....
