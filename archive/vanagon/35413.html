Subject: exorbitant EV parts costs


I think I need new rear brake shoes for the EV but the dealer
is quoting $58/shoe ($232 total), and they don't even stock them.
I think that's excessive, but I can't find anyone else selling them
(apparently they're not offered as re-built yet).

Anyone else have any sources for this type of &quot;normal-replacement&quot; item?
I saw a reference some time back about parts from Walser VW in AZ offered
at 20% over cost.  I haven't called them yet, as I'm wondering if folks
have found other non-VW sources for brake items.

Also, is there anything abnormal about the rear brake R&amp;R procedure?  I
haven't pulled the drum yet, and have only seen the detail the parts
fiche provides.  Looks like there's an old-style star adjuster in the
picture (like my old beetles).  Also, looks like the drum is held on to an 
inner hub by allen bolts and removal doesn't involve the bearings at all.
Is that different from how it's done on Vanagons (just wondering)?

Thanks!
