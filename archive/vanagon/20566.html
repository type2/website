Subject: Anonymous type II humor

While poking around N. Conway, NH (a very small Boulder, of sorts, filled with
many outdoorsy climber/hiker types) I spotted a pea-green, mid-'70's Westy
parked just off the main drag. On the rear and top left, where the &quot;Westfalia&quot;
insignia is usually located, the owner had written with black electrial tape;
&quot;Neverfalia&quot;

Ole'!

Ms. Moneypenny, my '71 Westy
