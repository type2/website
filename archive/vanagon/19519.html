Subject: Broken Door Handles


	Surely someone in So. Cal has a friend who has a friend
who has a CNC mill?  Do the handles have a shaft or anything
coming out of them?  My point, which I rarely have, being that
with the right connnections, one could make a batch of them
fairly easily...(depending on part geometry)
 
	Also, supposedly chroming parts decreases part life
due to some chemical reaction or something.  Most &quot;cool&quot;
finishes seem to reduce fatigue resistance.  

I think its past my bed time; this doesn't make any sense
