Speakin of Fartus Antiquitous' reference to chuck berry...

I do also remember &quot;Tootie Fruitie&quot; on the radio as a kid...one
of my first &quot;favorite&quot; songs....Little Richard...

nope...he came along AFTER I was born..so no namesake here..
though my parents claim I was named after a certain vice-president
from the early 50s...

Ric
