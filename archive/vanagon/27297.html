     &gt;If this was in the FAQ, it didn't stick in my mind. When was the
     &gt;sliding side door introduced on the bus? I've seen several WTB-ads
     &gt;for '5x Barndoors. That implies to me that you could also get '5xs
     &gt;with sliding doors? How about the '6x model years? All sliders?


     These trick questions! The &quot;barndoor&quot; has nothing to do with the
     door on the side of the van, regardless if it does or does not slide
     open like a barn door!

     The term refers to the oversize engine lid, mounted below a fixed
     rear window on early buses, through (?) 1955.

     Sliding doors were available on splitties as an option in the early
     60's, but were not routinely imported into the US until the breadloaf
     series started up in '68.
