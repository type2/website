&gt;&gt;There is nothing wrong with your speedo. All late model vanagon speedos that
&gt;&gt;I know of read way wrong. Like, when it says 75MPH you are really going 68
&gt;&gt;or something. They all do this. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I put on tires that are 2&quot; taller than stock and it still didn't fix the
&gt;&gt;problem I still read significantly faster than I am actually going.

What you need is having all four wheels to drive the speedo instead of only
one.
