Hiya! really nice to find another splitfreak this side of the world. No probs
with the ad. good way to do it!!! :) Glad you enjoy the mag, makes it worth to
hear people respond - it's lonely at the keyboard :( If you get time to write
something for the mag - excellent. Yoi could maybe do file transfer? Never
done that, my son has with all his stuff, but every time I play with this
thing it goes wrong! Look forward tommeeting you both - will you be at Bug
Freeze? stanford Hall is going to be mind blowing this year - hope the convoy
is over 100 strong....and I've lined up a local band to play for us in the
marquee. Don't miss it! Talk or whatever soon....Dave.
