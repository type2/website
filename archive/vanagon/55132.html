Subject: Schematic Programmable Delay Circuit


There is a nice site made by TEMIC including a whole
bunch of automotive electronic applications.

Visit TEMIC itself at

http://www.temic_dot_de

or directly to the automotive site

http://www.temic_dot_de/prodassp.html

and you will find applications like the wiper circuit.
But you have to have the capability to read .PDF files.

&gt;Has anyone
&gt;dealt with this by making their own programmable delay circuit for the
&gt;wipers to allow the delay interval to be varied?  Willing to share the
&gt;schematic?
