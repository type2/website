Subject: essential tasks

jfourni wrote that he was coming up with a list of completely essential tasks 
to do on a new to you VW. (CV Boots being one of them) IS there such a list 
or could this LIST make one? I'm thinking about things beyond the usual tun-
up and valve check stuff. Thanks in advance to any contributors.
