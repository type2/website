&gt;States.  I drove across from Ontario to B.C. in December halfway through the
&gt;States, and found that for food and accomodation, we were the same in either
&gt;country, and gas was cheaper in the States. :-(

Micheal, shame on you for bringing up crass monetary concerns about the
price of fuel for heaven's sake.  Sure it's a bit cheaper to the
south but is it really that important?  By the way, how much did you
spend for gas on your trip form Ont to B.C.?  I think the extra 
expense in fuel is more than made up for in that the trans Canada
is a bit out of fashion these days and would be less busy than the
interstates.  'Sides, we gotta do what we can to espouse on the
natrual wonders available here and nowhere else.  I'm sure that some
of our American cousins are just itching to take in some of what we 
have to offer here in Canada...  I can picture the expressions of 
stunned disbelief when the caravan roll into Ottawa on July 1st 
already.  This is said in the spirit of discussion and shouldn't be
construed as a flame, eh?  --Ralf
