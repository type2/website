Subject: towing boat

Greetings all,
	I have a question directed to those of you who drag a boat behind 
your vanagon. I have a 91 Vanagon and am considering buying a small 
fishing boat. My question is: When it comes time to back the boat into 
the water, how far do you take it in to the water? Surely it can't be 
good to submerge the engine? Just curious.

Thanks, Patrick
