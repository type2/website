Subject: Re: Idiot Factor + fuel line tip(?)

I installed a brass shut-off valve in line to the gas heater pump (sits
about mid-bus).  I bought this a marine supplies shop.  It attaches to the
undercarrage.  I had to make a base for it using a 5 x 5 cm pvc square, 
mounted the valve (3/8ths hole drilled in the center to anchor the valve) 
with a piece of stanless steel strapping.  This werks great when I need to
do an engine pull.  Merely close valve, remove from gas heater pump, and drain
into a container....
