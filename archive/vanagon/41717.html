Subject: Noisy front end.

My Westy has a death rattle when ever I go over washboard or rough roads. It
seems to be located on the passenger side for the most part. The van has
120,000 miles on it . I suspect  the bushings are shot, though I'm a bit
intimidated to start ripping things apart .
What I need is some of you guys to convince me that it can be done , without
to much hassle. I think that this may be one of the last things to be done
and then its road trip time.
