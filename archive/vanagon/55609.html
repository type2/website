Subject: Re: '86 ECU (digifant) needed!!!!!

&gt;No luck yet finding an ECU for my wifes 'new' '86. Checked everything and
&gt;indeed it is the ECU (thanks everyone for the help).

&gt;I've called everyone I can think of and haven't turned one up. Bosch
&gt;doesn't make rebuilt anymore (so I'm told) and there's no way I can swing
&gt;the VW's price of $700 or so!!

&gt;Can anyone help?


I had the same dilemna last summer.  But since junkyard ECU's were only 
$150, even though they were non-exhangable I figured I could chance it &amp; 
go through up to 4 bad ones before I'd spent as much as one new one.
Luckily, the first one was good.  I don't think that ECU's get damaged 
that much in crashes, so you have a fairly good chance of getting a good 
one from a junkyard.

Hope this helps!
Kathy
