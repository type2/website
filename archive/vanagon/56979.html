&gt; So KENYON FAIREY says:
&gt; &gt; I would like to know how it sleeps 6? 2 up and 2 down is the norm!
&gt; &gt; 

I would imagine it also has the cot (pretty rare on a Vanagon but 
common it seams with the middle seat), so you could in a pinch do, 2 
adults below, 3 kids on top and one on the cot, but I'd hate to 
imagine that.
