The Inuvik Run -- Stewart, BC

8 August

0842 Thursday 8 August 1996 -- Depart Boya Lake traveling south on
my own. (Log entry)
------------

I awoke early, fixed a nice breakfast, broke camp, loaded, cleaned
up the campsite.  I was ready to roll by 0730.  Waited for the
others to wake up.  Snores.  Filled out a comment card for the
campground, thanking whoever was responsible for the well raked
campsites and generous supply of firewood.  Pulled out on my own at
about a quarter to nine, heading south.

------------

(Log entry)
1800 -- Arrived at Stewart, British Columbia.  343 miles made good.

------------

I had been looking forward to the run down the Cassier, which
passes through gold country.  I'd planned to stop at several points
but conditions made that impossible.  The Cassiar Highway is
unpaved for about half its length.  Weather during the run was
rainy and cold.  On the unpaved portions the mud was a hazard,
reducing my speed to about twenty miles per hour.  Had I known the
road was so bad I would of stayed on the Alcan through Fort Nelson
and Prince George.

Like the Alcan, the Cassiar came into being during World War II,
providing an alternate land-route around the Alaskan panhandle. 
But it remains only partially paved.  The paving is found near the towns. 
Road conditions varied from excellent to very bad. On the paved
parts I was able to maintain my normal 50-55mph but in the mud I
was lucky to do thirty. The road climbs up onto the Stikine Plateau
and crosses the Skeena Mountains.  The Coast Range is to the west,
the peaks capped with glaciers and permanent snow fields.  Between
the veils of rain the scenery was spectacular but could not be
enjoyed when slithering through the gumbo of mud or truddling
across the narrow Bailey bridges.  

The goal for the day was Stewart, British Columbia, adjacent to
Hyder, Alaska and the bear-watching post near the Salmon glacier. 
On arrival in Stewart I scouted the recommended campsite, one of
the free sites maintained by the forest service.  It was a pit,
made worse by the heavy rain.  Took a swing thru town.  There were
a couple of RV parks in town, one very nice the other... not so
nice.  I went back to the turn-out near the forest service
campground, parked in view of the road, made some hot coffee and
settled down with a book.  After a time the rain let up.  A little
later Eddie and Jack steamed into view.  They had no news of the
others but thought Jorge and Yvette were behind them.  They checked
out the campsite, shuddered, and followed me into town to refuel.

At the gas station Eddie learned there is no border control at
Hyder.  Indeed, no controls of any kind.  Hyder, Alaska is really
just a part of Canada.  It uses Canadian money, Canadian telephones
and Canadian schools.  Eddie began telling the cashier about his
difficulties crossing into Canada and his fears of being hassled if
he went into Alaska and tried to come back.  As he added details
the girl's eyes became round.  You could almost see her hair stand
on end.  She was a lot less friendly when he finished.

We convoyed into Alaska just to be able to say we'd been there. 
After a dinner of fish and chips Eddie and his dad headed up toward
Salmon glacier to see the bears while Jack and I drove back into
Stewart, hoping to flag down Jorge on the road.  The RCMP was
waiting for us, as was Jorge, motoring toward Hyder as we headed
toward Stewart.  The Mounties followed us back into town, oozing
past as we stopped at the Tourist Information Center.  The Center
was closed, the parking lot placarded with dire warnings not to
camp there.  There were picnic tables and a nice lawn but there was
also the Mounties in their little Bronco, motoring past with stern
looks.  

I volunteered to wait for Eddie &amp; his dad while Jorge and Jack
scouted out the camping possibilities.  I was reading Chaucer with
one eye, the other tracking the RCMP Bronco.  After passing me for
the third or fourth time the Bronco made a neat U-turn and vanished
up a side street... only to reappear, an inch at a time... from
between two buildings!  Seeing the nose of the Bronco creeeep into
view was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. 
Deputy Dawg was staking me out, waiting to pounce the instant I
began smoking dope, sticking needles in my arm and accosting the
local virgins.

Eddie &amp; his dad reappeared as it was getting dark.  The RCMP pulled
out of the alley to Show the Flag while we chatted on the CB.  Jack
and Jorge returned, convinced the forestry service camp was a bad
idea.  We convoyed over to the first of the RV parks to check on
accomodations.  They made it clear we weren't welcome.  We tried
the other park.  Before I could state our business -- indeed,
before I even reached the office, an old man came running out
shouting &quot;You're too late!&quot;  

&quot;Too late for what, sir?&quot;  (I really did say 'sir.'  I'm especially
polite to assholes.)

That caught him unprepared and he began to stammer.  We were too
late to find a space.  The camp was full.  (There were several
vacant spaces in view.)  And too late for tomorrow, too, as a big,
big convoy of RV'ers was due.  And other stuff, that he would
explain as soon as he could think of it.  His hands were shaking,
his eyes full of fear.  In the office behind him a woman was on the
phone, her body bent forward in a tense curve, speaking rapidly.  

The old man was still shoveling Canadian bullshit down our throats
when I turned to the others and suggested we get the hell out of
Dodge.

There was only one campsite at the forest service camp.  We packed
all four vans into the available space, Jack behind me on one side
of the table, Jorge &amp; Yvette on the other, Eddie &amp; his dad closing
the laager by parking across our sterns.  The tired clouds wept
dreary rain.  Dry is an alien term in this part of British
Columbia.  Ditto for warm.

By rigging tarps between the vehicles we made a protected area over
the table where we cooked a scratch meal.  

A couple of vehicles -- including the ubiquitous Mounty Bronco --
found it necessary to visit the forest service camp during the
evening.  But none had the balls to approach nearer than a hundred
feet.  Instead, the local hoodlums parked on the turn-out across
the lake and showed us how loud they could play their radios. 

Yvette thought it was hilarious that four Volkswagen vans could so
terrorize a community.  She kept playing out the old man dashing
onto the porch shouting &quot;You're too late!&quot;  Her infectious laughter
soon had the others smiling and the evening seemed less dismal. 
I'm not as forgiving as Yvette.  There is a sickness of spirit in
Stewart, British Columbia.
