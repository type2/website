'84 vanagon camper, 103K miles, bought used in '87 at 33K miles.  The only
problem is head gasket leaks between cylinder sleeves and heads, happened
at approx 34K, 66K, 102K miles.  I have communicated with you earlier
about this.  Am probably going to get the rebuilt engine VW is offering
currently, use only VW coolant, and flush/replace coolant each year.  

I would love to receive the results of this survey.  My (non-authorized)
VW mechanic thinks *ALL* vanagons in these years have this problem.  I
would be very interested in knowing the statistics for this and other
problems.

Best wishes,  George
