Well, when I was visiting my brother in Germany I decided I liked the 
shower unit they had.  But I worried about the threads being a different 
size.  But my brother said that because we helped them rebuild the 
infrastructure after the war, they used American threads.  I don't know 
if that's the real reason, but it sounds likely, and my shower works fine.

ObVWcrap:  I found some load range D tires at the junk yard today.  They 
make my old bus drive alot better than it did with the crappy old 
regular bias ply tires.  The load range D tires say they are rated for 
60 PSI, but I have them at about 42.
