Subject: Massachusetts source (?)

Howdy volks,

just got back from finding a source for new vw parts.  I know a yard 
that has about 18 VW Bugs and a lot of used parts.  He wants to sell 
the whole deal (about $9000).  Alot of the vehicles looked in poor 
shape.  He appears to be honest and straight forward.  Those 
interested the place is about 30 minutes south of Boston.  He let me 
try out a bunch of  old keys on my '65 deluxe and sold me a hubcap 
for (my offer) of $5.  Anyways, his address and name are:

Ken's Foreign Auto Sales and Repairs
149 King Street Route 3A
Cohassett, MA 02025
(617) 383-9649

cheers....
