Subject: Re: 84 random hiccup

There is no mystery to fixing this. Buy the $100+ air box auxiliary wiring
harness at the dealer and you are all set. I don't know why people keep
writing about this as though it is some big mystery. The wriring harness works.


&gt;Hello all:
&gt;	Just a little &quot;hey it's happening to me too&quot; note fr or all vanagon
&gt;owners.  After reading the many inputs into this list for the last year
&gt;one of the common problems with the vanagons seems to be what people 
&gt;are calling a random &quot;hiccup&quot;.  You know the &quot;sudden lose of power at
&gt;cruising speeds&quot;  the  old &quot;like some one disconnecting the ignition 
&gt;at random times&quot;.  It has been complaints such as these that have 
&gt;intreaged me because of the many different &quot;possible solutions&quot;  It is as
&gt;if there is a gremlin in the engine compartment that know one really
&gt;find and fix.  Well it is hao ppening to me now so I thought that I would 
&gt;share my data with those of us trying to track this gremlin down.
&gt;Hiccup data
&gt;1. occurs only at cruising speeds 45 - 75 mph
&gt;2. seems to be totally random, wet or dry no correlation
&gt;3. occurs only when engine is warmed up 
&gt;4, the hiccup will continue until you stop at a toll booth or pull to side f 
&gt;for a few minutes. It is then highly probable that the remainder of
&gt;the trip will be hiccup free. (has never been otherwise)
&gt;5. Can affect frequency of hiccup by small gas peddle fluctuations.
&gt;
&gt;	On my last trip the hiccup was worse than ever.  My brother
&gt;was with me so I had him observe the engine whilr e we were hiccuping
&gt;down rt90.  We were hoping to see a spark or small gremlin chewing
&gt;on a wire but all seemed fine.  Pulled over for about 5 min and continued
&gt;for the remainder of the trip (200 miles) without a hiccup.
&gt;
&gt;	Has anyone out there had any success with a fix for this 
&gt;problem?  
&gt;
&gt;Robertt 
&gt;
&gt;
