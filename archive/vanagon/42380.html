Subject: The Yellow-striped Modulator (need)

 I'm sitting on my mountain watching the rain wash away the sins of
Man. This year we've been particularly bad so it's taking longer than
usual. My moss has stopped itching tho.
 I just got a call from the guy who owns a '73 type 2 w/automatic.
Seems the modulator has developed leak and there is no local source.
 It seems also there are about 3 types of said chingadero, so the one
I need has one yellow stripe on it as &quot;code&quot;. As opposed to red or blue I'm
told. 
 If anyone has any knowledge of this part or has said part, please let
me know.               thanks to all     west
