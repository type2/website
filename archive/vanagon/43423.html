Subject: Westy Roof Storage Questions

Anyone have suggestions on what might be a good way to keep clothes and
equipment dry that one would store on the top storage area just above the
driver and passenger of a late model Vanagon (1990 in my case).  Does
anyone make a large waterproof bag that would fit that storage area.
