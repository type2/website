&gt;  Hello listmembers,
&gt;     Taking my son to school this a.m. Noticed when I changed lane car behind
&gt; me blew horn. My signal was on but clicked fast. Got home and  checked rear
&gt; bulb was out.
&gt; Replaced bulb and signal worked fine. Was wondering if signal supposed to
&gt; give you this  racing click when bulb is out or do I have some kind of
&gt; electrical problem. 
&gt; 
&gt;                                                       Thanks, 
&gt;                                                         Wayne

Wayne,
Yes, they're supposed to blink at double speed if a bulb burns out so yo
uknow to fix it.

Kinda neat eh?
