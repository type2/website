Subject: 1985 trouble starting after long driving

Hello all,

        After i do a long highway drive and come home and park the van, the
next morning the van has trouble starting.  I turn the key and nothing
happens, for a while and then it starts, after a particularily long trip the
van refused to start even after a long time of holding the key in the on
position.

I remember something being continually posted about the solenoid.  Is this
the problem?

thanks in advance for your help.
