That reminds me, my old ISP (teleport) decided to close my account without
notifying me.  I'm fighting with them for access so I can at least get my
files off of there, but for now, my VW page at www.teleport_dot_com/~des/vw is
down.
Fortunately I set up a mirror of it at my new ISP.  the URL is

http://www.anet-dfw_dot_com/~ddes/vw

Some things may not work, but it is mostly there.  Sorry if this caused any
confusion.
