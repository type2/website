Subject: Overheating

I have an '89 Westfalia camper that seems to be running hot. The temp gauge
tends to run above the red light on the gauge, even when it is cool outside.
Whin I am climbing a hill of any size, it nears the first of the two little
dots at the top of the gauge. I don't notice any power loss, but it just
seems really hot. Anyone have any experience with this? I just had my coolant
changed and the mechanic told me he thought it was OK.
