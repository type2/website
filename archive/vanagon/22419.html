     (snip)

 it seems to idle good until i reconnect the 02 sensor...

     Patrick:
     Are you answering your own question here? What about a bad 02 sensor?
     Since I don't know if you have an &quot;active&quot; or &quot;passive&quot; 02 sensor (in
     other words, mine has not crapped out yet, so I have had no reason to
     look), here are ways to check either:

     1.Active sensor. Usually identified by two (or more) wires going to
     the sensor. One of the leads is voltage in. The sensor will send back
     a varied voltage to the brain to indicate fuel mixture. Use a quality
     voltmeter and look at the output voltage. I should be somewhat steady.
     If it is all over the scale, it is immediately suspect.

     2. Passive sensor. Usually has one wire going into it. Sensor will use
     the voltage coming down the wire for operation, and vary its internal
     resistance to indicate fuel mixture. Brain looks at amperage needed to
     complete circuit as indication of mixture. Use a quality Ohmmeter and
     check its resistance while running. Once again, if all over the scale,
     it is immediately suspect.

     Good to see you back on the list, Patrick!

     Also, a junkyard in Rockville, MD has an '87 with the newer
     instrumentation cluster (includes Tach). Didn't you want one of those?
     Guy wants $75.00 for it. FYI. Let me know if you want it- I'm going
     back for other parts next week.
