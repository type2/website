A friend and I did the Yukon &amp; Alaska trip last year in a 92 EV.  We met up in
Calgary, caught the Stampede, did the dinasaur bit at Drumheller then up to
Banff, Jasper, Prince George, Ft St. John, Nelson, Whitehorse, Dawson City -
where you trip makers should meet for your leg to Inuvik.

By this time, we had ruined two tires.  We order a set from Whitehorse ($175
each plus the bur freight).  Met a couple that had just came back from Inuvik.
They ruined a set of tires on the Dempster Highway.  A very rough road they
said, but beautiful scenery.  We decided not to go there.

Over the Top of the World Highway to Tetlin Jct and then to Fairbanks - salmon
country on the Yukon river..  Then to Anchorage, then Homer - a must visit.
Back to Whittier for the ferry to Valdez, and back to Tetlin Jct - a great
loop.  Back to Whitehorse but now on Highway #2 to Haines - eagle country.

Ferry to Skagway, drive to White Pass (gold miners' route). Next a thirty-six
hour trip by ferry (saw whales and dolphins)  to Prince Rupert, British
Columbia.  On to Prince Rupert again.  At Quesnel, side trip to Barkerville
(fantastic gold site run by Parks Canada). 

Off the main highway at Clinton to Lillooet, then Whistler - take the half-hour
ski-ligt to the top.  Then Sqamish and home to North Vancouver.  This last leg
has some spectacular scenery.  We were gone for six weeks.  This, beginning
after our Drumheller visit.

We wrote  up our trip in our Campaq laptop.  I was going to post it but after
unzipping the file that I had stored it, found that it was corrupted.  However,
I do have a print out and if anyone wants a copy, will photocopy it.  It is
quite lengthy.
