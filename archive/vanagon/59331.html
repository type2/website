Subject: Drivers, start your kids!

Howdy,

I'm getting slightly bored with the 'splash' page on vanagon_dot_com.  What I'd
like to do is start a gallery of kids' drawings of vanagons.  Send me your
kids' drawings of your bus and I'll put them into a special Kid's Gallery.

Once I have enough work, I'll change http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ to randomly
display a piece of kids' art every time you come by.  I'm hoping to do this
from June through September.

Here are the rules:

     1)  Send the artwork to
              Ron Lussier
              10164 Parkwood Drive #8
              Cupertino, CA  95014-1533

     2)  If you want the drawing attributed to your kid, enclose a note
         with the kid's name (and optionally, age.)  Your kid can also
         sign their work, and I'll scan that with the rest of the art.

     3)  Bright crayon drawings will look best.  I'm looking for that
         definite 'kid-art' look.

     4)  If you want the drawing returned, please let me know in
         the envelope.

That's it.  I'll be watching the mailbox!

Coyote
