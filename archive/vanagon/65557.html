Subject:      Re: 1995 Eurovan Camper for $27,000

I would say that that is not a good price, inasmuch as I bought a 1997 EV
Camper new for $32,000 plus taxes and licensing here in Colorado.  What I
have heard about the '95 is that the engine was still too small for the
weight of the vehicle, which is over 5,000 pounds dry weight.  I recommend
that you talk to the first owners of this vehicle and find out how the
Norcold (which some pronounce &quot;N'erCold&quot;) fridge works in the thing.  And
of course the fridge must have two vents to the outside, which is an
indication that it has the &quot;high altitude (over 5,000 feet) kit&quot; and so
will be able to work at higher elevations.
