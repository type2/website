&gt; &gt; Hi: I don't know how common block heaters are in the States. The Tristar
&gt; &gt; I have came from Canada and it is equiped with a block heater that is a
&gt; &gt; 3/4&quot; thick plastic block
&gt; 
&gt; I would have sworn that it was aluminum.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; with heating elements in it that fits under and
&gt; &gt; against the engine block. I could climb underneath to see if I can find
&gt; &gt; any markings or part numbers if I was coaxed. I bring this up because
&gt; &gt; this is the only one I have ever seen and assume it is a VW piece.
&gt; 
&gt; They are very common in Canada and yes I believe they are a VW part.

Yes ,you are right. It is alumminum. VW PN LR20976    Model 200w  It
also says &quot;Made in Canada&quot; Eh?
When I recently changed the oil (The first time I have changed it myself
in this transporter) I saw the heater and was surprised to see it there.
It is broken however, (there is a little arm that reaches over to a case
bolt that is snapped off) like plastic does, and add several thousand
miles of road grime that made it look black like plastic and I just
thought it was---- well you guess. Actually this is good news. Now I
should be able to TIG it back together. Jeez, you can't get away with
anything on the list.
