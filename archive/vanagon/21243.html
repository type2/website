Subject: Re: 87 Synchro-buy it?

&gt;Dub-sters,
&gt;
&gt; I have found a one owner 87 Synchro Vanagon w/ 87k. Asking about $3k. New
&gt;exhaust, don't know many other details... formerly used by handicapped so,
&gt;the van is bare behind the front seats. Any thoughts on conversions? Is
&gt;this a dog? Or should I jump?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for your help.                                       R.
&gt;

Well...

If the drivetrain is in good shape, you're looking at about $6K in parts
value there alone.

If it were in my neighborhood, I'd have jumped long ago (where I'd keep it
is another issue).
