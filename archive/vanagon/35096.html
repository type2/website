&gt;1. Wondering what specific instructions to give him, as to what to look at.
&gt;
&gt;2.  Is there a diagnosis process for that front heater core, without
removal?
&gt; Drilling a small hole in the blower housing for instance?
&gt;
&gt;3.  Is the valve accessable on top of spare tire, or do I pull that rubber
&gt;oval plug in the cabin floor?

If yo have vw dealer replace core, they remove glovebox,  cut slot in side of
housning and pull core out through slot.  I don't approve of this, but that
is what they did to my 84 sunroof when I got them to good will it.  I believe
in changing the core and fan motor as a set.  They both die when you need
them most.
