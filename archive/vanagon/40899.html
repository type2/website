Alright, I'm just a little curious as to where these classic Volkwagens 
are getting their automatic transmissions from...
Unless I'm opening my mouth up more than my brain again trying to figure 
out what AT stands for in an automobile add.
I bet these are the same people who are selling their vans because they 
don't go fast enough. Hint: try second gear. It's not an automatic....
