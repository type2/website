I am helping a friend to replace the pushrod tube seals on his '81 
Westy.  When he pops the valve cover bail off of the left side it hits
the catalytic converter and won't let him get the cover off.  So we 
are wondering what needs to be removed to do this.  Does the exhaust 
have to come off or at least part way?  He says the Bentley is no help
in the matter.  He is on the way to the store now to buy an idiot 
book.  This is all I know.  He is half a continent away from me.  I 
can't check my Muir from work and I figured someone here might have a
few things to watch for on this.  Ok, thanks for any help.  Jim
