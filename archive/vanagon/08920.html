&gt;This morning when I went to start up the Westy, the starter did its usual

&gt;someone mentioned that unless the Main Computer receives a minimum
&gt;voltage the engine will not fire; does this include a signal to the
&gt;starter as well?. In other words if the voltage of the battery is below
&gt;the acceptable threshold will the starter turn (assuming it has enough
&gt;cranking amps to do so) even though the engine will not fire? TIA - DC --

nope. the low-voltage thing about the computer doesn't affect the starter.
in fact, the starter can keep on grinding away until the voltage IS too low
for the computer to work. you might want to thing about that BIG mutha wire
to run between the battery ground strap and the starter mounting bolt(s) ...
it helped my 80 vanagon a lot. made the starter spin over a lot quicker and
it didn't rrr rrr rrr even in about 10 F (above) in Rhode Island one
christmas. it's a bitch to run a wire that big (and maybe a slightly smaller
one would work), but it did help.
