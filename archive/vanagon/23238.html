Subject: 1st Annual Love-Bug-Off Sept 9-10 in FLORIDA

Yes, it is time for the annual fall return of our illustrious Love-Bug.
Not the small Beetle named Herbie, but the smaller flying insect found
joined to it's partner smooshed on your windsheild.  They are back in
droves and to celebrate we are having the first annual &quot;Love Bug Off&quot;

A small attachment of us volkswagen enthusiasts are planning a two-day
retreat at the lovely O`Leno State Park in North Central Florida.
Anybody is welcome, rafts, Canoes, BBQ and grilled veggie thingies will
be available in copius quantities.

Bring wetsuits (not flamesuits) and kids are more than welcome. Seriously,
O`Leno is one of the last natural Hammock parks in the area that hasn't
succumbed to the pressure of adding a huge tourist attraction/waterslide to
it's points of interest.

A large rope bridge, miles of pristine cypress lined hiking trails, a wide
lazy river for swimming, canoeing, snorkling, etc.,etc. All in all a bit of
anything for just about anybody.

For info on reservations (so we can get as many sites near each other) and/
or directions on how to get there (or to be added to our buddyride list) get
in touch with me:
