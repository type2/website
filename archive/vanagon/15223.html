&gt; sounds good!!!! [say that to yourself, it won't make any sense after a few

&gt; a high wistle from the tweeters that follows engine rpm.  how do i make it
&gt; go away?

Turn the stereo off...    Works well, but defeats purpose.
Invest in &quot;low interference&quot; spark plug wires...  Helps a bit, expensive
Put up with it...

I don't get it in the van, butI've noticed it when Driving my mom's Honda.
It's not loud enough to bother me, I can't hear it over the music, and
between songs I don't mind.

There are &quot;special&quot; low interference plug leads which you can buy (probably
at J.C. WhipMe) that are supposed to eliminate this and almost do.
(I don't know if they are as good tho)


Are your plug wires in rough shape? Plugs deteriorating or over gapped?
Excess resistance in ignition can cause it to be worse.

I don't know how loud it is...  
Is it worth spending money on?
Make sure all grounds are good... Engine/batt/stereo...
