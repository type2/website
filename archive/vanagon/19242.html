&gt;I just got one of those hand-held GPS (Global Positioning  System) units

AAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
somebody beat me to it!!!!!!!!

&gt;Last night I laid it on the dash and cruised homed at doing 49.8 knots.
&gt;Not only does it give my position (in Lat./Long.) and speed but also elevation
&gt;as well as a plot of my course... It does many other things like current
&gt;heading and allows you to plan stops along the way in which the thing will
&gt;prompt you as you approach your waypoint.  The one I got is a Garmin GPS
&gt;45 now on sale at West Marine for $299.  Martha, forget the microwave....

damn!!! and i was sooooo close to actually balancing my budget!!!!!!
