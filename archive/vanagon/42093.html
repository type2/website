&gt;&gt;&gt;  Hello volks, and the usual to the point. My question is about Vanagon
&gt;front
&gt;&gt;&gt; spoilers. Will a spoiler from later Vanagon fit an 82 model? Would major
&gt;&gt;&gt; modifications need to be made to install the part? Thanks!
&gt;Although I don't know if a later model spoiler will fit, I do know that some
&gt;sort of spoiler/air dam will have a positive effect on the handling of the
&gt;vehicle (less lift under the front end).  Yes, it does increase frontal area
&gt;a bit, but the handling improvements at speed are worth it.  Just think of a
&gt;stock-based racing car.  Flared fenders, deep air dam, monster spoiler on the
&gt;back, etc.  Sure it adds a bit of drag, but the benefits outweigh the
&gt;downside.

While it should improve handling at high speed, the REAL
reason for the dam is not for handling, but for the improved
fuel efficiency.  What you would think is a lot of increased
drag is actually reduced overall drag because of the
reduction of airflow over the dirtiest part of the car --
the undercarriage.  That's why virtually every car made now
has big body parts hanging below the bumper line.  You can
attribute it to the CAFE rules.

I remember Car &amp; Driver in '73 or so put a homemade aluminum
airdam on a Pinto, put clear plastic headlight covers over
the recessed headlight bucket, and wound up with a
noticeable mileage improvement.
