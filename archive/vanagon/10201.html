A flyer came with this months Volksworld for a 
1/24 die cast scale model of a 62 Deluxe Micro Bus. The model looks
rather nice in the photos (well it would I suppose), with
quite alot of detailing. 

The bus is red up the the waist line and white on top.
The rag top slides back on tracks, the steering wheel (LHD I think)
and front wheels turn, all the bits that are supposed to open do open,
the second row seats fold and a fairly good engine look alike exists 
in the rear. Apparently the undeside is detailed as well. The only
thing that looks wrong is that the door hinges look about twice the
size they should be.

And the cost of this little beauty?
95 quid!!!

Lets see for that much I could replace all my front bearings,
or get some welding done or .........
