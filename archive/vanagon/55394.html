&gt;  Can anybody come up with the PIN # for the relay that is used with the aux.
&gt; battery hookup. I've been having a problem with my main battery going dead
&gt; after long periods of the van just sitting. I think the relay is supposed to
&gt; open when the motor is shut down. The relay is located under the drivers
&gt; seat in the spare batttery box.

My relay is really a light relay that I purchased from our local VW
dealership.
It is made bt &quot;Flosser&quot; with a umlaut over the &quot;o&quot;.
It says on the box &quot;R2245 12V 40A Resistor W. Germany&quot;.
I don't know what the &quot;Resistor&quot; refers to.

Hope this helps,
