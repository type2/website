Subject: Re: Help: 80 Westfalia propane tank location


&gt;I looked at it quickly in the dark, and I was wearing my suit so I
&gt;didn't crawl around under the bus, however I didn't see the propane
&gt;tank on the drivers side that I have on my 84.  Is it located
&gt;somewhere else?  Or perhaps missing?

I assume it depends on the company that did the camper conversion: the
propane tank in my van (County Homes conversion) is bolted to the floor
panel right underneath the sliding door...
