Subject: 87 Vanagon FS

Hi all. Just got through reading a couple of days worth of postings. It is
better that way to see how all things come out!! Anyway, a FS spotted in
the Keene, NH Sentinel. All disclaimers apply.
        1987 VW Vanagon GL van, dual air, 5 -speed, power windows &amp; locks,
3500 miles on engine,
                $ 4500. Walpole Valley Auto, 603 - 445 - 5167
I am also going to put in &quot;old style&quot; louver windows in my 86 Westy. Let
you all know how much fun it is!!
