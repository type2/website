&gt;       Maybe I didn't make myself clear.  The problem is, when the
&gt;motor is OFF I do not have to press the clutch pedal to switch gears.
&gt;When the motor is off, I can easily move the transmition into whatever
&gt;gear I want without pressing the clutch pedal.  Whith the motor
&gt;running, you need to press the clutch pedal down to switch gears.
&gt;
&gt;So yeah, I am going to replace the clutch cable


Well, I guess I'm still not clear on whether the original poster on
this one, is pulling everybody's leg, so I'll stick mine out a little
further.

Dear sir,

Put your tools away. Go wash your hands. load some party people into
your bus and head for parts unknown, because... your bus is fixed,
and running completely normally, and eager for you to take it on a
bus-type road trip!

Yes, with the engine running, you can't change gears without pressing
down the clutch pedal to the floor. Well, not unless you are moving
forward and don't mind a hellacious grind out of the tranny when you
do it. Better start saving for a new tranny, though, if you keep that
up. I made it 500 miles from San Jose to San Diego that way, but it
was an emergency (clutch went bad) and I had NO other choice, except
walking. And I've been apologizing to the tranny ever since. Muir
describes this procedure in his book-- it's saved my bacon more than
once.

And with the engine stopped and the bus sitting still, yes you *can*
move the shift lever from gear to gear without pressing down the
clutch pedal. So can all the rest of us, in our buses.

Tell me again why you believe there's something wrong with your bus?

BTW, I always used to set my clutch pedal free play to about 1-1/2 inches.
Works for me.
