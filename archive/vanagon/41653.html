Subject: how do these vws sound?

Greetings!
	Since I am selling my 70 Westy, I am looking for something I can drive
now.  I've talked to some people locally, and came up with these and want to
know if the prices, etc, sound right.
'77 camper: good shape, can pass inspection, in body shop right now waiting for
	buyer's choice of color.  $1800 (sounds good to me!!!)  It also has a
	72 engine.  How's that transplant work?  Is it a good idea?
'73 Superbeetle: tired engine, rusty floors, needs exhaust (maybe just muffler?)	some AC parts in.  $250.
'77 bug: sunroof, being restored, almost done, about $2000
'77 bug: no floors.  I don't know about anything else.  $395
So what sounds good?  If anyone else is intereste din my '70, it's still 
available and needs a good, loving home.
Thanks!
Amy :)
