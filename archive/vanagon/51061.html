&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First day ad in the Kansas City Star:
&gt; &gt; ----------------------------
&gt; &gt; 1986 Vanagon 5sp fr &amp; rr AC $2150 (816)454-8409
&gt; &gt; -----------------------
&gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure it's 816, may be 913.  Sounds like a good deal.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; I checked this out.  Turns out it's really a used car dealer selling it
&gt; and it's really a 4speed, the shysters.  8-(
&gt; 
&gt; Front end was hit a bit, 138k, some seam rust started.  Crappy tires on
&gt; it.  Oh yeah, the reserve coolant tank was dry as a bone.

Too bad -- I was hoping that the 5-speed was really a syncro in disguise,
and that someone would steal a great bus!

Someday, I'll see one of the 5-speeds (that ain't a syncro), but it hasn't
happened yet.  Does anybody know how many non-syncro five-speeds were
made (as a ratio, maybe, among all vanagons, perhaps with automatics listed
too)?  What years were they available?  How much extra did they cost, and
how much do they add to the value for used ones?  I'll try Edmunds, but my
web viewer is really slow this morning...
