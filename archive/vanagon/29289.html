I was grumbling to the dealer that despite $50 worth of new plastic bits,
fistfuls of grease and a couple of hours dicking my shifting wasn't 'like
new'.  He said to adjust the vanagon by putting the shifter into reverse,
then loosening the floor nuts and letting the plate end up where it wants
to, then retighten.  The stick should be vertical when done.  I haven't
tried this yet, sounds bogus, but hey, its free, and you're doing it anyhow,
so let us know if it's true&lt;g&gt;  Tim Smith
