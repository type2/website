Subject: '81 Vanagon, stumbles after warmed up

First, I haven't subscribed to this list in a while, so I don't know how to
get on the digest list - an anyone help?

Second, my '81 Vanagon has been having problems for almost a year now:
After it has been running for 1/2 hour or more (and especially after it has
been running, then stopped for gas or something, then started), it will
&quot;stumble&quot; while cruising along.  &quot;stumble&quot; means that the engine will lose
power for an instant (fraction of a second), which can be felt throughout
the bus.

Any clues as to what to look for?  Is this something I need to take to the
dealer (for their diagnostic equipment)?

I rebuilt the engine about 2 years ago, so hopefully there's no problem there!

Please copy any responses to ed_at_sun-valley.stanford_dot_edu
