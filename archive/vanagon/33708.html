Subject: Re: '75 that stalls when cold...

&gt;Hey, whoever you are that posted about the '75 FI bus that stalls when
&gt;cold, I can give you something to think about.
&gt;
&gt;In the VW fuel injected engine, there is a cold-start valve which
&gt;supplies fuel to the intake air when the engine is cold.

        This is simply incorrect.  Or only 1/2 correct...

        It's the cold *start* valve, not the cold *running* valve.

        The thermo-time switch, as you mentioned, does control the
grounding of this &quot;fifth&quot; injector.  However, the + side is wired to the
starter switch.  This cold *start* valve only gets current if the following
are BOTH true:

        a)  the starter is being engaged, AND
        b)  the thermo-time switch is cold

The two failure modes of the cold *start* system are:

        1)  never opens --&gt; hard to start the car, then runs fine
        2)  leaks all the time --&gt; car always runs rich

        The &quot;choke&quot; functions are controlled by the brain &amp; temp sensors,
which enrichen the mixture (by changing injector duration) whenever the car
is *running* cold.  The cold start system, is well, the cold *start*
system.

Good luck!
