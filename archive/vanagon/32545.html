&gt;&gt;OR - a la Bob Hoover, crush the beans with a hammer, rock,  and stir the
&gt;&gt;coffee with a wrench!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For strong coffee, wait till the wrench floats.
&gt;
&gt;For REALLY strong coffee, wait till the wrench dissolves...

this reminds me of a co-worker who cut the working end of the spoon away
with a torch and would substitute it in a restaurant cup of coffee.  Should
have seen the startled look on the waitress's face when he pulled it out of
the cup complaining that the coffee was too strong.
