&gt; &gt;&gt;      trips to VW boneyards qualify as a good family vacation
&gt; &gt;&gt;      would be appreciated...
&gt;&gt; if anyone can answer the above previously posted message i would love to
&gt;&gt; hear about it! i think the mysteries of the universe would be revealed

&gt;Sure, 
&gt;You send the kids out to see who can collect the most fuses &gt;and relays,
&gt;it's a great game, kinda like an easter egg hunt.  The wife &gt;gets to
&gt;hold the engine lid open for you so it doesn't catch you &gt;off guard.

Take a camera, get a picture of the wife sitting on that ol caddy or volvo, make up a storu about it.

Edeucational the kids can get some close up eyeball on how a dump truck works.

Easter egg hunt is good too (I found $18. in pennies in a trunk) one time.

Too many reasons not to go to a junk yard.

Come to think of it, why arn't junk yarda on maps,

like city hall?????
