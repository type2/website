Subject: '91 Vanagon engine fire

I thought I would report on the information I now have on my '91 Westy's engine
fire, and ask for any information any of you might have on similar safety
problems.

The insurance company hired an investigator to examine the Westy. He frist
called me for some info, then examined the engine. When he called back he asked
for a few more details of the incident. Senario:

	12 degree F morning - clear and cold
	Van was cranked and allowed to warm for a couple of minutes
	Van was driven 6 miles, parked, left in reverse and turned off

	On the way over to the destination, during a small uphill stretch, the
	  driver noticed that the engine seemed to 'miss' once.
	
	The driver was inside about 5 minutes and came back out to find flames
	  coming out from bothrear wheel wells.
	The driver ran back in and asked someone to call the fire department,
	  grabbed a fire extinguisher and ran back out to find the engine
	  completely engulfed in flames, flames coming out of the upper rear
	  air vents as well.

	During burning, the Van lurched back multiple times, finally hitting
	  a fence - partially knocking it down and catching it on fire as well.

Investigator's report:

	The clamp/O ring assembly on the first cylinder failed, allowing the
	  fuel injector to shoot out and gas to spray into the engine com-
	  partment. The fuel injector was no where in the engine. Multiple
	  spark/short marks were visable, but were a result of the fire and
	  engine burning. 

He stated that -

	We were lucky! Had the fire not been visible to the driver, and the
	  key been turned in the ignition, the engine and propane tank would
	  have in all likelyhood exploded.

We can all invision what this would have been like!

PLEASE - if you have experienced any problem with the clamp/O ring assembly or
fuel injectors on your '91 Vanagon - contact me with your information. 

The investigator is contacting the Nat Highway Safety ... with a detaild
report and performing a full investigation of related recalls.

ANY information you may have would be of assistance to us in this case. 

AND - PLEASE check your clamp/O ring connections on all cylinders for any 
sign of wear/cracks, etc.
