&gt;&gt; &quot;barney,&quot; but nobody seems to use that...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;This term has also transferred over to the snowboarding world.  Although as
far as 
&gt;I can tell it has lost the negative association it used to have for
surfing.  Now 
&gt;it just seems to mean &quot;board babe&quot; (no political incorrectness intended)
although 
&gt;this may be a purely Canadian phenomenon.
&gt;
&gt;And what do big purple dinosaurs have to do with surfing anyway?

Sorry, but the term pre-dates the purple dinosaur poof by about 20 years.

I love you
You love me,
we're a hap-py fam-ily
then a shot rang out 
and barney hit the floor!
no more pur-ple dino-saur!
