Subject: Syncro decals

I am putting new decals on my Syncro - the Syncro on the front and the 4WD on
the doors and I am thinking of having a sign company shoot the new decals
that I have and make ones in color instead of black. I was wondering if there
are any other Syncro owners that would like to get a set of colored decals as
I will have the images converted to a disk. You would have tell me what color
you want and leave it up to my best judgement if there is more than one color
ie maroon or brick red. I don't know what the cost will be yet but the set of
3 decals list at the dealer for about $85.
So I am sure it will be a lot cheaper than that.
Let me know if you are interested.
