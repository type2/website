Subject: Karen's alternator in Seattle...

    ...just wanted to say thanks to everyone who responded to Karen's
emergency up there. I have relayed all the responses to her and she's
currently in the &quot;THINKING&quot; mode...she'll probably get an alternator from
BOW WOW as a lot of you suggested.
    Thanx again, you're a great list !
