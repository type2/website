In regard to VW T&amp;A's little note:
&gt;Please take my name off the list. At this time there is no benifit for
&gt;either your group or ours.


JEEEEEEZZZZ now I know where the editorial content comes from the
little crank polisher can't spell too good.... benIfit????

I guess there just wasn't enough Tits and Ass content here for him..
or not enough 16 year old crank polishers....maybe it was the
comments about Martha and Flannel that finally got to him!

Oh well, lets get on with our adult real VW conversations...now
where did I put that box of kleenex...and that VW T&amp;A centerfold
calendar....

Titsless and Assless,
but always tasteless and proud!
