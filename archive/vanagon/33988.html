Subject:      Re: VANAGON TIRES

 While I was looking into tires for the EV (a continuing saga), which uses
205/65/15 tires, I heard from a Nokia Tire distributor that Nokia makes a
reinforced version of itsfabulous Hakkapelitta 10 winter tire expressly
for the Vanagon.  He claimed that the 185/70/14 tire had 8 plies and that
he had actually run them throughout the year and they performed well. They
still had alot of tread left at 50k miles. If interested, talk to Barry
at Import Tire in Glastonberry CT : 800-288-1030.

BTW: My EV's contis are apparently not as worn as I thought. The VW dealer
mechanic thought they had at least 10k left on the front ones and more on
the back ones. And he reminded me that I had a beautiful and unused spare,
suggesting that I  just get one new Conti and use the spare when I was
ready to replace the fron tires. Anyone seen any COnti Contact C-21's out
there. Reinforced (of course), made in Germany. Carry 1609 lbs.
