&gt;So what's the consensus of opinion.  Since I have the one-wire connector,
&gt;is the Ford dealer out?  I definitely want to stick with Bosch equipment
&gt;so the aftermarket suppliers are out.  Is the Ford part cheaper than the
&gt;VW issue part?  Is the Ford part a three-wire or one wire?
&gt;Should I worry about this after I find out what the oil pressure
&gt;situation is?

definitely go for the Ford dealer or the local parts store. you get Bosch
parts anyway (i don't think anybody else makes those things) and it's a
helluva lot cheaper than the vw dealer. the FLAPS here sells one-wire bosch
for about $30.  Ford uses both 3-wire and 1-wire, but on different years and
models (just like vw). so you'll have to ask.

i dunno. it's kind of a side-issue to the oil pressure; something you can be
doing while you wait for an idea or part on the oil pressure. :)
