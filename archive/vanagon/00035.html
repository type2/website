If the ECU is really the root of this surging thing we should demand (yea,
right!!) Volkswagen to replace them.  It seems to me that a lot of people
have this, or have had this problem.  The fix seems to be the ECU.  I have
the same problem right now, it only seems to do it occasionally, but I want
to get rid of the problem!!!

Who else has had this problem, and how (if you could) did you fix it???

I've been racking my brain about this one, and I have done everything I
could to make sure all of the connections are right.

P.S.  I've had my ECU apart to look at it.  Not too complicated.  Wonder if
I could replace (carefully) all/most of the components.  I have done this
with the idle stabilizer, there's only a handfull of components it this
thing, and they can justify charging $125 for it.

Rambling again!!!
