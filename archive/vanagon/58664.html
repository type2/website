&lt;&lt; Hi, I'm from Dauphin, about 10 minutes north of Harrisburg.  I was
wondering all is involved in joining  HAVoC.  I own an 81 Westy.  I plan to
attend the show next saturday and am wondering if the list members meet
anywhere or, I don't know, how do you guys recognize each other.  I'm fairly
new to the list, obviously, and appreciate any info you can give.  Thanks.
 &gt;&gt;

Hi.  I'm in Allentown, so I'm not a member of HAVoC, but the club had a table
set up in the show area last year where you could sign up, and they were also
handing out free club window decals.  As far as V_at_L listmembers identifying
each other - how 'bout this (and I'll need everyone's cooperation to make
this work...)  how about we all meet at the bandstand at 1pm??  Seems easy
enough to do. Anybody else have any other ideas?
