Subject: Re: '60 Tranny problem

&quot;I went to see my new '60 single cab yesterday and when giving it a test
drive i couldn't get it into first or second gear. yet the guy selling it
could, although with a little difficulty.
     
     now i'm well used to difficult tranny shifts so i don't thinks its just
me.
     there was no problem getting it into reverse or 3rd or 4th.
     the bushing at the shifter end has been replaced.&quot;

if its not in the rear, it could be in the front under the floor. - is the
plate adjusted right?   The other thing you could do is shimmy underthe bus,
take the filler plug out of the trans, stick your finger in (yum!) and take a
look at the oil.   Better to do this after driving, as 1) it'll stir it up,
and 2) it'll make the plug easier to get out.
     
     by the was there is virtually zero rust on this baby, like a small 
     hole 5mm in one of the rocker panels.

if it's a nice bus it's worth dealing with some mechanical hassles
