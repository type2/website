Dear Pierre,

I regret that I have no experience with water-cooled Volkswagens.  Given a
choice of any them I buy a Toyota.  I have some experience with the 22R
Toyota engine and admire it greatly; a very reliable and easily maintained
powerplant.

The Vanagon mailing list (vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu)  has now been divided
into two lists, the original Vanagon list being devoted to those having
water-cooled engines, the new list (Type2_at_lists.primenet_dot_com) will focus
mostly on the older model Transporters having air-cooled engines.

I believe you will find the information you need by contacting the Vanagon
mailing list.

I am sorry I can offer no recommendation for the water-cooled Volkswagen
vans.

-Bob
