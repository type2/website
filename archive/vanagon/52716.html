Subject: More Big Buses

I tend to use my syncro to haul my sound system out to parties. It is a four
point system with 4 bass cabs (30&quot;x25&quot;x25&quot; - all four fit EXACTLY between
the rear bench and the front seats), 4 tops which fit neatly in the hatch
(36&quot;x18&quot;x24&quot; they are trapizordial so they make a nice block), amps, effects
rack, montiors, dj coffin, cables, extension cords and all fit in and I
can still see a little bit through the back window. When we unload it, people
stop and watch the clown car as piece after piece after piece comes out...
And since it is a syncro, I get to do this just about anywhere ;)
