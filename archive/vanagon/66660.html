Subject:      the million dollar vanagon

After many hours of grueling effort and a lot of patient help from my
FLVD (friendly local volkswagen dealer), I was able to make a complete list
of all the spare parts in a 1991 vanagon GL.  After adding up all the
prices
for each spare part, I came to the happy conclusion that every vanagon
owner can consider themself a millionaire.  The complete sum of all
the spare parts came to $2,346,000.78.
