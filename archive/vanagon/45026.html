Subject: 67 westy questions.

I have a 67 westy... and am looking for screen frames for 2 of my jalousy
windows. If anyone knows where I can found me please let me know..

As for the cargo floor, it appears it once had plywood ana linoleum floor,
does anyone know the thickness of the plywood and should there be a plywood	
floor over the engine compartment???
