&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does someone have the 'specs' on compression for a 2.1L  per VW?  I know the real 
&gt;&gt;world ones run around 110psi (low end) on up but I'm curious as to 
&gt;&gt;what the actual spec is.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;TIA --  Dan
&gt;&gt;

I constantly checked compression on my 84 vanagon's engine. The readings
were around 128 psi, and the van has had 105k miles.
