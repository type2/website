Subject: Type2 rocker repair notes

After reading the discussions between Lee Griffiths and  John T. Croteau, I
remembered that I had notes as to replacement parts that actually fit. The
following is only from personal experience. Everyone is free to ignore or
disagree with the following.

TypeII rocker panel replacement parts that fit require two sources.

Inner rocker panels that fit: Das Bulli Haus (203) 642-7242

Outer rocker panels that fit: Wolfsburg West (714) 630-WOLF

** Personal experience as of 11/94 was that ordering both pieces from either
source didn't fit worth beans. A combo as stated above fit pretty straight
ahead! I'm sure that both sources are reputable good people and their
mothers love them and all that poop. The suppliers used by these sources may
have changed since 11/94. It seems silly to suggest two sources for this
common repair but it worked for us. It has been my experience that metal
pieces from some suppliers are only roughly the original shape/size and
needed alot of trimming. The history of each bus (previous hidden collision
damage etc.) may dictate the way any repair panel fits **
