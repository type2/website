&gt; Dose anybody have a source for a resonably priced Bicycle Rack that

&gt; a replacement water facet made by Delta Six Industries .(Do they sell
&gt; replacement parts directly?)

Delta Six is now Euro-American RV Products.  Call them at 818-760-4214
from 9 to 11 AM Los Angeles time.  They do sell the water faucet.

Good luck.
