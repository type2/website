Subject: Full throttle switch for 1984 Vanagon (Calif. 1.9 Digijet)
Date: Thu, 10 Jul 1997 09:00:01 -0600

If there is anyone on the list who has a full throttle switch for an 84 
1.9L I would be interested in buying it if the price is right (the dealer
wants $52 for the thing).   It looks just like the off idle switch.   
Thanks,
Kip
