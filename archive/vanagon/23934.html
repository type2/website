Subject: $50 Engine

Just had to tell you all about the deal I just got. I put an ad in the 
local shopper paper that I was looking for a good or rebuildable 1600cc 
engine. Well, last night a kid called me and told me he had a 1600 out of 
a '71 beetle that he and his dad (a mechanic) had rebuilt. He was going 
to find a beetle to put it in, but never did.

Anyway, it's got new jugs and pistons and &quot;everything but the carburator.&quot;

When I asked him how much he wanted for it he says: &quot;I don't know, 
whatever you want to give.&quot; Wait, I thinks, this kid is 13. I'm not about 
to take advantage of him.

&quot;Tell you what,&quot; I says, &quot;why don't you talk it over with your dad and 
figure how much you want and I'll call back tomorrow.&quot;

I called back today and talked to his mom: $50.

Now, I'm not sure how much I should trust their rebuild. 
&quot;Mechanic&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;VW Mechanic&quot;...but hey, for $50, I can afford to rebuild 
it...or pull parts from it...or just set it on my living room floor for 
the kids to play with 8) And to top it all off, I just put a check in the 
mail yesterday for a carb and spare dist. 8)...

Okay, so now that a few of you hate me, I guess I'll get back to work. 8) Joe

BTW, should I expect a '71 Beetle motor to bolt up nicely to my '71 bus 
tranny?
