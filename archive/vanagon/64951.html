Subject:      Bus Depot order arrived

Thanks Ron, and the list members that recomended the Bus Depot as a source
of parts.

        I received my first order and am very pleased.  Not only do I have a
great start on putting my camper back into great shape but I had a great
time sending notes back and forth to Ron, wasing his valuabe time!

        Now anyone know a good source for touch up paints?  My local paint
shop has know idea how to turn my paint code number into paint!
