Subject: Wheel Alignment 2nd Opinion

Pete Sellers previously asked:
&gt;Anybody know an inexpensive way to get a second-opinion about the quality/need
&gt;of alignment?

I took my '82 Westy to the VW dealer for a routine service, and had one of
their coupons for a wheel alignment service.

When I picked up the car, it turned out they had subcontracted the alignment
to a nearby Goodyear Tire Center.  The VW dealer gave me some mumbo-jumbo
about not being able to do the alignment themselves - never did figure out
if the camper was too big to fit in their alignment bay, or if somehow 
their VW factory-supplied alignment rig did not work with Vanagons, or
what.

Anyway, the Goodyear store (which has a lot better local reputation than
the now-defunct VW dealer had) supplied a computer printout of the before
and after alignment specs.

Maybe taking your newly-aligned Vanagon to a Goodyear store and asking
for just the &quot;before&quot; specs is a way to check on how the earlier job was
done?

The paperwork looked like the Goodyear store charged the VW dealer more to
do the alignment than the VW dealer charged me (what with the coupon and all).
Yes, I still believe in Santa Claus, too.

So, I don't know if the printout was pure b.s., or if you can trust it as
an objective record of alignment.
