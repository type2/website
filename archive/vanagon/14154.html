Subject:      say you want portable power??? :)

well, i was thumbing through an 18-wheeler magazine, and saw something neat.
so i filled out the bingo card and mailed it in. today i got the results.

Lightning ... the anywhere, anytime generators.
Emergency Power Unit - 12V, AC/DC
* Portable emergency generator
* AC and DC outputs combined into one unit for maximum versatility
* 800 Watts of output for operating AC power equipment
* 80 Amps of boosting current at 12 Volts for rapid battery boosting
* Lighter than any other generator brand available (16, yes, Sixteen pounds)

Model GEN-50969 Emergency Power Unit
800 Watts**, 12V DC, 115V AC, 55 Amps charging, 80 Amps starting,
             2 HP, 2-cycle, recoil starting (lawn mower pull rope).

and the price, you say? well ... the fellow here in alabama said the retail
for one unit is $389. but if someone wants to order 2-9 units, it's $337.
and if somebody wants 10-more, he can come down below $300.
and he said he can sell a big mutha halogen work-site light (the light is
pictured as just about as big as the generator!) for $25 if you buy more than
one. oh, yeah. how big is it? 11x11x10. inches. :)  now, he did say it is
NOT all that quiet, so you might have to plan when you run it (so as not to
disturb the neighbors). ;)

the guy i talked to is
McGriff Treading      (800) 950-4298, ext. 361 (ask for Mike)
P.O. Box 1148
Cullman, AL 35156

for those of you NOT in AL, you might want to find someone closer to home,
so here's the manufacturer's info:
Active Technologies, Inc.    (505) 437-0021
1117 LaVelle Road            (505) 434-6149 FAX
Alamogordo, NM 88310

what the unit is designed to do is provide worksite power for running tools
and charging batteries of tractors and such (that might have died over the
weekend). or provide lighting for emergency crews. oh, yeah. you get free
jumper cables with it.
