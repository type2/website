Subject:      Front heater problem

Congratulations!  I have the same problem with my 84.  I have the
replacement clips to use to put the heater housing back together after
splitting it in half (see Bentley).  I haven't tackled the job as yet.  The
dealer has ordered two new break away bolts for the steering column.  I'm
still looking for the procedure for removing the dash.  I understand that
the steering wheel has to be dropped and the dash completely removed before
the heater box can be accessed.  Then it should be easy to get to the
motor.(?)  Some say the problem may be the motor.  Others say the dropping
resistor may also have blown.  I suspect the problem is just the motor.
Here is some of the information I have collected on the subject.  Let me
know if you find out how to drop the dash!
