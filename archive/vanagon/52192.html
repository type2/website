  I am low on power steering fluid and the manual says to use Dextron to fill
 up the reserve. Well that was good in 1990 but I don't think you can find
 dextron now. All I can come up with is Dextron III ATF fluid. I assume that
 this is compatible but.....Do YOU know for sure. Would appreciate a quick
 answer so we can start driving the Van again.......Thanks Bill

The new fluid will work fine.  If you are low, it means you have a leak.
 Check the rack.  If there is any fluid sittiing in or leaking through the
boots, the rack will need to be repaired or repalced.
