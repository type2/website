Subject: Poptop Seals - Calif Imports

Picked up the seals from Calif Imports in Vancouver BC - I'll update 
once I've tried 'em.

The big one was 99 cdn, not including the over the roof flat seal, 
which is ok on mine. Small front section was 30 cdn. The seals look 
good, and use a continuous aluminum clip system.

Looked pretty much same as WCM stuff from BowWow, with exception of 
missing flat seal piece.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
