Subject: Safare owners manual on the web
Date: Wed, 28 Feb 1996 23:58:33 -0800 (PST)

Volks,
	I updated (slightly) the web page dealing with my Safare camper.
The main thing new is the owners manual which I scanned.  There's not
much to it, but it is interesting, and almost certainly uncommon.  If
you've ever wondered just what exactly a Safare Custom Camper is, now
you can see the &quot;official&quot; representation at:

http://www/teleport_dot_com/~des/vw/daboat

The scans are kind of large - I will try to shrink them and put up
thumbnails in the next couple of days.  For now be prepared to wait a
couple of minutes if you click on one of the pages from over a modem.
More to come...

-David
