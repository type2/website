The dealer said NO to me really loudly when I asked. They didn't rec. 
synthetics in the gear box at all.  Despite it going into Audi boxes _at_ 
$24/litre from them. I don't know what the call is here, I'm using fresh 
dino juice presently but would like to go synth. due to cold weather 
shifting.  Keep us posted if you hear any little grinding noises. Dealer 
said &quot;it burns bearings&quot; but I can't accept this if it meets viscosity index 
specs and usual other protection factors. Mixing?   Tim Smith
