So David Carment says:
&gt; 
&gt; For all those who think it folly that Canadian provinces should be
&gt; recognized separately may I remind you that World Series Champion of
&gt; Major League Baseball is a Canadian team and that if there had not been a
&gt; strike this year the champeens most likley would have been another Canadian
&gt; team from another province....DC
&gt; 
&gt; BTW we Canadians are distinct from Americans on several counts (we know
&gt; how to make love in a Canoe...).
&gt; 

They also know how to pay even more outrageous taxes than we do... ;)
