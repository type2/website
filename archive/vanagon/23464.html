Subject: RE: Oil light

&gt;&gt;Wrote:
&gt;&gt;The oil light flickered on. It never came fully on, just flickered on
&gt;&gt;and off.
&gt; I have had the same thing occur on my '77 westy, the oil light
&gt;flickers a little after driving fast ( a relative term in a bus) then
&gt;coming to a stop and idle at a light etc. The owners manual for the
&gt;type II says that this is normal and not a cause for concern. So I am
&gt;not concerned, lord knows I can find plenty of other bus related
&gt;worries to hold my attention.
&gt;Peace,
