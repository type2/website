                                         Getting it Right
                       Adjusting Deck Height and Compression Ratio

The use of rebuilt heads poses a problem for the unwary.  Wanna NOT blow up
your engine?  Read on!

                                       Doing the Numbers

We need to start with some definitions.  The manuals differ on how they lable
things so for now, use the following:

Compression ratio is determined by dividing the total volume (V sub t) by the
swept volume (V sub s).

Total volume is the sum of the chamber volume (V sub c), the deck volume (V
sub d) and the swept volume (V sub s)

Chamber volume is not calculated, it is measured directly.  For your basic
overhaul you don't need a very precise number but you MUST know the
approximate chamber volume.  An easy way to do this is to obtain a fat 50cc
syringe from a veterenary or pharmacy, level the head with the valves and
spark plug installed, then fill the chamber with water.  Do it several times
and average the results.  Do it for all four chambers.  When you calculate
your compression ratio, use the SMALLEST of the four chambers for chamber
volume (V sub c).  

If the chambers are larger than 50cc use a marble to take up some of the
space.  Determine the marble's volume by dropping it into the half-filled
syringe.  It's volume equals its displacement.  (Eureka!)  Use the same
marble(s) in all four chambers and don't forget to add its volume to the
reading off the syringe.

Swept volume and deck volume are calculated using the formula:

    0.785 x bore diameter squared x stroke

Stroke is 69mm for a stock engine.  If you're rebuilding a 36hp, use 64mm.
 If your engine has a stroker crank, use that dimension.  But don't guess.

To calculate deck height, use the same formula but substitute deck height for
stroke.  
Bore diameter is whatever pistons you are using.  A stock 1600cc engine uses
85.5mm jugs.

Use millimeters for all of your calculations.  1mm is approximately equal to
.0394 inches.  Measure your deck height then convert it to millimeters by
dividing the inch dimension by .0394

Since you'll be using millimeters for your calculations, the answer will be
in cubic millimeters.  To convert to cubic centimenters, shove the decimal
three places to the left. 

                             Trouble in the Engine Room

To illustrate, let me walk through the calculations using real data and real
heads, a pair of rebuilts I have here in the shop.

The engine is a stock 1600cc dual-port.  The jugs are 85.5mm in diameter.
Since we use that same diameter when we calculate deck volume, lets run the
numbers and get it out of the way.  85.5 x 85.5 (that is, the diameter
squared) equals 7,310.25.  Now we mutiply that by 0.785 (that is, the pi
factor) to get 5,738.546.  We will use that value to compute both swept
volume and deck volume.

  5,738.546 times the 69mm stroke gives us 395,959.6913  as our swept volume.

The deck height measured .065&quot;  Dividing that by .0394 gives us 1.649mm.

   5,738.546 times the 1.649mm deck height gives us 9,462.86.

The combustion chamber measured 43.5 cubic centimeters so lets convert the
other factors to cubic centimeters before we add them together.

     395,959.6913 becomes........                396.0cc (rounded)  Swept
     9,462.86 becomes.......                            9.5cc (rounded)  Deck
... and our chamber volume was....               43.5cc (averaged) Chamber

Which gives us a total volume of...              449.0 Total Volume

(Note:  Engine displacement is based on swept volume rather than total
volume.  Four times 396cc equals 1584, the displacement of a '1600' engine.)

Dividing the total volume by the sum of the chamber and deck volume gives us
 449.0 divided by 53.0 or 8.346... which is our compression ratio.  And that
is too high.

                                   A Bit of Background

This particular engine is in the shop because it blew a piston -- hole about
as big as a
quarter, right through the top of the thing.  And it was just overhauled,
too.  

How could such a thing happen?  Easy.  The kid bought a pair of rebuilt heads
and slapped them on without bothering to check anything.  But one of the
heads had been flycut.  Flycutting reduces the chamber volume, which raises
the compression ratio.  A combination of hot weather, a heavy foot,
low-ocatane gas and a high compression ratio lead to detonation.  Naturally,
the kid kept on driving.  And of course he had to really keep his foot in it
to get over them hills with only three cylinders.

The second jug blew a few minutes after the first, which convinced him to
turn around and head for home.  Amazingly, he managed to make it home on the
two surviving cylinders.  Of course, it cost him an engine.  He now drives
his mom's Toyota and rails against veedubs as 'nothing but junk.'  His mom,
no dummy, won't even let him check the air in the tires :-)

So you run the numbers and they say the compression ratio will be too high.
 What do we do now?

We put spacers under the cylinders, that's what.  Of course, we need to know
how thick a spacer we should use but that turns out to be pretty simple, we
merely turn the equation around.

                                              More Numbers

With a total volume of 449cc, what volume chamber-plus-deck will give us
7.3:1?

To find out, just divide 449 by 7.3.  You should get about sixty-one and
half... 61.5cc's.

And since you can't change the chamber volume, lets get it out of the
equation by substracting it from the 61.5.   61.5 minus 43.5 equals 19.0cc,
or about twice our original deck volume.

Since we measured the deck height as .065&quot; the quick and dirty solution would
be to double it by slapping a sixty-thou shim under the jugs and drive on.
 And it would work just fine, too.  But quick &amp; easy answers are often a bit
too quick &amp; easy.  Remember, deck volume appears in both sides of the
equation.  If we increase our fixed volume -- the volume of the deck plus the
volume of the chamber -- we have also increased our total volume.  So before
we dash off in all directions, lets run the numbers again.  First, we'll add
9.5cc to our total volume, making it 458.5 cc's. Now we add 9.5cc's to our
fixed volume, making it 62.5cc.  Now divide 458.5 by 62.5 and see what you
get.

    7.336?

Ah ha, said the mechanic.  Ah ha indeed!  Close enough.

(But what if the numbers had been off?  In that case simply do the
calculations over again, increasing deck height by ten thou (.25mm) each time
until your compression ratio drops below 7.5 to 1.)

Okay, in this case the numbers worked out close enough.  And a sixty-thou
spacer is a standard item, if you call around.  But be careful.  Everyone
carries tens, twenties and forties.  They'll tell you to stack them up to
make a sixty but don't do it, you want as few surfaces as possible.  The good
shops carry shims all the way up to ninty thou (.090&quot;) in increments of ten
thou (.010&quot;) and only charge about eight bucks a set.  Cheep.

(Before posting this article I called around to verify availability and price
of cylinder shims.  A couple of outfits only carried the thinner three sizes,
gave me the 'stack 'em up' bullshit.  The better shops carried the full
range.  Johnny's Speed &amp; Chrome sez stackemup, Mark Stephens' shop was the
other sort -- &quot;We got stock, ten thru ninety. Or we can polish you up a set.&quot;
 I like their attitude.)

The range of available spacers brings up another point.  The use of cylinder
shims or spacers is the normal procedure used to adjust the compression ratio
of a rebuilt engine and all of the better after-market suppliers keep the
standard sizes on the shelf, ready for immediate delivery.  But if you want a
size that isn't in stock, the price goes up dramatically since someone will
have to chuck a set of spacers in a surface grinder and bring them down to
the size you need.  This can cost up to forty dollars.

So let's say your numbers tell you to use a spacer exactly .035&quot; thick.
 Unless you're out to win a race, don't do it.  Order a set of forties and
drive on.  But don't stack up your shims.  It increases the risk of leaks.   

The rule here is to opt for the next larger size of standard shims that will
give you the compression ratio you need.  And it's handy to know that the
paper gasket in the standard overhaul kit is about .008&quot; thick.  I don't use
gaskets on my engines since I prefer a metal-to-metal joint between the
cylinders and crankcase, but in a special case with stock jugs, I might use
them. 

                                             Sermonette

Stock Volkswagen engines have used compression ratios as low as 5.8:1 and as
high as 8.5:1.  Given today's gasoline, the wiser course is to err on the low
side, with a compression ratio of no more than 7.5:1, and a whole lot less if
you buy your gas at a Pemex station.

Rebuilt parts are liable to vary wildly from the dimension of stock, original
Volkswagen equipment.  When someone sez a part is 'stock' it don't mean a
thing until you clap a caliper on it and see for yourself that it falls
within stock specs.  

In an earlier series of posts I wrote about filter/pump adaptors that were
machined about .006&quot; undersize, rendering them useless.  On returning the
part to the store I demonstrated that it could not work as intended.  Months
later I visited the same store and saw the same filter-pump in the showcase,
waiting for the next sucker to come along.  When it comes to parts, rebuilt
or new, it's insane to trust the veracity of the guy behind the parts
counter.  He's a clerk, not a mechanic, and in this case he's a dishonest
clerk.  YOU are the mechanic.   The kid behind the counter isn't building the
engine.  And he isn't paying for it, either.

 When you assemble an engine from an assortment of rebuilt parts you're
dealing with a host of unknowns.  A few simple tests and measurements not
only eliminates confusion it usually results in a better engine.
