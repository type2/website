Subject: Re: Fitting a rack onto the top of a 1991 Westfalia

I've seen a standard rain-gutter setup for this purpose.  False rain-gutter
flanges were mounted high onto the sides of the pop-top, say 3&quot; tall by
4 or 5&quot; long:

A standard rain-gutter mount roof rack (the usual two cross bars)
would mount to these.  Off season, the flanges themselves could be
removed.

   &gt; 
   &gt; I'm looking for information on how I'd go about fitting a roof rack (to 
   &gt; carry a small boat) onto the top of a Vanagon equipped with a pop-top.
