Does the clutch pedal go all the way to floor too easily? Have temps been
cold out? It could be debris in the lines and all that is needed is to
have the lines bled. DC

&gt; Looking for help.  I have an 85 Vanagon who's clutch doesn't want to
&gt; disengage.  My local mechanic says best to replace both the master
&gt; cylinder (under dash) and slave cylinder (above transaxle).  I think
&gt; there has to be a less expensive option.   Of course I've thought
&gt; this before.  There is no sign of leakage at either cylinder and I
&gt; figured there should be a rebuild kit for the slave cylinder.  My
&gt; mechanic says rebuilds don't work.  I had a Ford Cortina that I
&gt; rebuilt the slave cylinder on and it worked fine.  Any suggestions
&gt; out there?  Anyone run into this problem that would like to share
&gt; their experience?
