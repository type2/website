&gt;Tonight I bought a book put out by Robert Bentley Publishers entitled &quot;How to
&gt;Understand, Service and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management&quot; by
&gt;Charles O. Probst, SAE.

I highly recommend this book to anyone with a f.i. engine.  If not to save you
do-it-yourselfers from alot of grief then to keep your mechanic honest.

Factoid:
In the front chapter is a list of applications of Bosch f.i.  The make/model
that has the most number of installations is the CIS system on the Rabbit/Golf
at over 400,000.  Next is the L-Jetronic on the VW bus with over 250,000 units
in the field.  Most other makes (Volvo, MBZ, etc) were in the 20-40,000 range.
