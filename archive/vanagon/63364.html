Subject:      Help, getting on the list!

A friend I met on the old list is trying to get back on and getting error
messages.  What exactly should he do to get on?  I transfered over and just
giving him the addresses from the heading didn't do it.  Help!  I really
want to help him he has been giving me tons of help with my 84.
