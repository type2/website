Well, David,  I ended up chewing out Sears -- not because they weren't 
&quot;6-ply&quot; which doesn't mean much -- but because they drove badly.  I got 
them for $5 more to put on some Michelin 195/75 XC LT4 tires.  These are 
not the vaunted and expensive ($90+) XZX tires (which they don't carry in 
any form), but I am satisfied with them.  They are not as good as the BF 
Goodrich tires I took off, and probably are not as good as the Dunlops 
also mentioned on this list (LT5s for $93 in my area and a 4 day wait).

It was not worth the hassle, and next time I'll do it differently.  Like 
I'll buy the tires and have someone put them on who's close to home and 
I'll hang onto the old tires until I'm sure I like the new ones.

I don't know if I told the list that one of the Trailhandler tires that Sears
put on went flat yesterday.  I drove it flat the block and half to the gas
station -- man did that do a number on the sidewall.  I wasn't going to keep
them, though, so Sears ate the cost of those.  No guilt -- I got to Sears and
it took them an hour and a half just to get the car on the jack (they promise
tires in an hour) and then *I* had to start it and drive it up to the garage
because the yahoo who was going to do it killed it and couldn't get it
started.  It being fuel injected, I'll guarantee that he put his fat foot on
the gas (he *was* fat, but he was also young and stupid) and that's why he
couldn't start it.  I've NEVER had trouble starting that thing.  Geeeez. 
Next time I won't restrain my two boys....they can have their way with 
the entire store &lt;steaming and gritting his teeth....&gt;....


Still rolling (barely...)
