&gt;1)  With the colder temps at night and the repeated re-flattening during 
the
&gt;days to work out excess moisture, we have the option for organically 
produced
&gt;&quot;freeze dried&quot; possum  !


They make great frisbees, too. Watch those edges, though. Pull your
spare tire off the rim, and it'll make a great carrying case! Mount
it on the front of your bus (or in the front trunk of your bug), and
it'll keep them plenty chilled and ready for instant use.

Boy, next dog that pees on your left rear wheel, is in for a surprise...
