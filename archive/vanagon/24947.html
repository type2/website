Subject: Wasserboxer or Aircooled?

So my old 78 is getting tired body-wise, and I'm not inclined to do the
work on it. Mechanically it's excellent, but the usual rust is depressing.
I'm gonna update to a Vanagon but am not sure if there are any advantages
to the H2O machines. Should I stick to the pre 84's? Any and all comments
would be appreciated from those who own them.
Thanks,
C.
