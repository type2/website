Subject: Cruise control

I'd REALLY like to install some kind of cruise control in my '82 Westy,
but I've seen models that merely have to be installed on the dash and
there's really not much space there... besides, if I did put that cruise-
thing there, it seems to be an awkward and ugly place. Are there any
cruise-things out there that are highly recommended because of ease
of operation, decent cost (around $100), not an eye sore, and easy yop



to install?
