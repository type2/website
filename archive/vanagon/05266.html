&gt;&gt;Bobo? That's very cute. Kind of reminds me of Montgomery Burn's teddy bear
&gt;&gt;in one of the Simpsons' episode.
&gt;
&gt;Watch it, pal!!!! Bobo happens to be MY nickname!  Your treadin on thin 
&gt;ice.  I may just have to pu..., may just have to jump through the 
&gt;net..... may just have to.....
&gt;But then again, maybe I can't necessarily do anything. =)
&gt;
&gt;So, watchit, or I'll put the evil eye on you =)
