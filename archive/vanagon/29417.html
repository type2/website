Subject:       wrong ignition coil.

I took my '72 in for a check up and the mechanic told me i have a bug 
coil. He says it is only half the size it should be.  how will this 
affect my preformance?  what about distroying other parts of the 
ignition system?  how much should i expect to pay and what kind of 
coil should i get?
thanks.
Ed.
