If I were you, I'd be very careful with this.  Even assuming only financial
damage is covered, a contention that they *intended* to sell it again at
some undefined future point would make you liable.

Aside from that, there is the moral issue.  Stealing is not OK just because
you think you can get away with it.  Could I steal a candy bar from my
local convenience store and get away with it?  Probably.  Whether I get
away with it or not, it would still be wrong.

Copyright and patent laws protect &quot;intellectual&quot; property from theft.
There seems to be a growing idea that these are not important, but I guess
I'm just not locked into the material world well enough to believe that the
things I make with my hands are protected from theft, but the things I make
with my mind are free for the taking.

&gt;Copyright only applies when there is financial damage. In the absence of
&gt;demonstrated financial damage, they cannot collect. Everybody keep this in
&gt;mind, and copy stuff as much as you like, especially stuff that is no longer
&gt;for sale from the manufacturer. My guess is, it is probably safe to copy
&gt;everything but the Bentley manuals.
