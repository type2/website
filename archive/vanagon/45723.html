The other option is to buy my '81 Vanagon which is FS in Phx. This bus is
totally rust free, straight as an arrow, runs great, excellent tires,
totally complete and nice. Down side? needs clutch soon. $139.00 in parts
plus labor to fix.
I can't give this thing away near the advertised $1981.00 (very) obo which
amazes me as I have seen total POS (non running) buses sell for much higher!

Dennis is having engine probs:

As I recently mentioned, I need to replace the engine in my '80
&gt;Westy (due to towing-induced over-rev).  I am considering
&gt;several options:
&gt;1.  Buy a rebuilt engine from Mark Stephens High Performance.
&gt;2.  Rebuild it myself
&gt;3.  Have my VW factory heads with only 11,000 miles on them
&gt;rebuilt locally.
&gt;Is there another engine vendor I should consider?
