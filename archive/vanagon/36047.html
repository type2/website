&gt;Another person opined that since ALL of my trips were disasters of one sort
&gt;or another, I should keep them to myself and not waste the bandwidth with
&gt;obviously trumped-up accounts.  Another cast doubt on the veracity of my
&gt;mileage figures.

well ... i'm an old doubt-caster from way back, but ... :)

&gt;However, should the general feeling be that such trip reports as I've
&gt;submitted in the past are of no interest, I'll abide by the wishes of
&gt;electronic community of which I'm privileged to be a part and pull the plug
&gt;on the word processor.

hmph. i, for one, would rather continue to see &quot;trip reports&quot; from one and
all. part of Bus-dom is going on travel trips, and part of traveling is
telling about it ... or sharing it with someone. it would be a wasted trip
indeed, if someone took a trip alone and never told anyone about it.

besides, you guys put up with my &quot;poetry&quot; last year, so i can extend a lot
of leeway to others and their writings. ;)

besides, i still wanna hear the one about the camper at Bonneville, trying
to establish a Land Speed Record ... (no, really: somebody actually did that).
