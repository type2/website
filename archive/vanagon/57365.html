You might be a listmember if...


10.) You get more Email than the rest of your company combined;

9.) You have a funny silvery oval sticker thing on your bus;

8.) You regularly send money to people you've never seen, trusting
    a reputation you can't prove, for parts you've never checked out,
    which must have failed on the previous vehicle or they wouldn't be
    parts now;

7.) You spend more time, attention, and $ on your bus than on your spouse;

6.) Your bus is older than your spouse, and looks a lot worse, but you
    still prefer it anyway;

5.) When everything is finally fixed/complete/shiny/running/done on your
    bus, you find yourself at a complete loss in any conversation;

4.) When a day goes by that you don't worry about maintaining your bus,
    you know something must be wrong;

3.) You ride a bicycle to work, to be sure you'll arrive on time;

2.) You notice a crank on the inside of the driver's door on your friend's
    Honda, and wonder what it's for (splittie joke);

1.) You live for the day when you'll find a broken down minivan, so you
    can hear the occcupants say &quot;Gee, there's a *lot* of room in here&quot; as
    you give them a ride to the nearest towing shop.
