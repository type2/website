&gt;unscrewing rusted bolts. I'm talking about the six bolts that hold the
&gt;exhaust system to the heater boxes, so 3 bolts on each side. I can't get a
&gt;grip on them: the 12mm wrench is too large and the 11mm wrench is too
&gt;small. Tried using a vice-grip but it slips off.
&gt;I'll try to be more creative tomorrow, but if someone, somewhere, has a
&gt;good idea, please let me know.

here's one that usually works, but is a bit dangerous: smoke wrench.

take a small propane torch (like plumbers use) and heat the bolt and the
area around it. be SURE that you didn't put anything flammable on the bolt
and don't have ANY gasoline anywhere around. the heat expands the things a
bit and the vice grips can then loosen them. be sure to wear some work
gloves ... otherwise, you'll have burn marks on your fingers (like me). :)
