&gt; I bought my 85 Vanagon about a year and a half ago.  The AC has never

&gt; merely want some guidelines to assist me when the dealer begins to take 
&gt; full advantage of my ignorance  ;-).  Many thanks.

For that, don't take it to the dealer.
Take it to one of those greasy little A/C &amp; Rad shops on every
corner of suburbia.
It's probably just outta R12 and they can fill it up for you.
After filling, get them to go around the lines with a &quot;sniffer&quot;
to see if there are any leaks.

You used to be able to buy r12 in one litre _at_ liquid bottles
but the govt. of Canada has disallowed this, I don't know about the
states, but I assume that it's the same there.
