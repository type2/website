Subject: was front brake pads how, now water pump replacement how?

     Hello all,
     
     Thanks for all the responses to my question concerning pushing the 
     brake cylinder back into the caliper housing for a front brake pad 
     replacement.  A 4&quot; C-clamp did the trick wonderfully.
     
     Sorry it took me so long to respond, but I'm 4 digests behind in 
     reading the list and have been super busy.
     
     All of a sudden, the list has become a much higher priority as I have 
     discovered a problem.
     
     I recently noticed a squeaking sound from the engine compartment that 
     sounds like a loose belt.  When I went to tighten the belt, I noticed 
     a coolant leak.  It appears that coolant is leaking from the rotor on 
     the water pump and was being sprayed on the belts causing them to 
     slip.  There is also the grinding/rattling noise coming from the 
     general water pump area.
     
     I think the bearings have gone on my water pump.  Is this a correct 
     diagnosis do you think?  Is there anything else I can check to be 
     certain that this is the problem?
     
     I searched the archives for the procedure on replacing the water pump, 
     and I have the procedure FAQ from the web site.  Is there a gasket or 
     sealant of some sort that I need to worry about?  Should I replace any 
     hoses while I'm in there?  How difficult is the procedure?  
     
     I am not that expereinced.  This will be my first water pump.
     
     Thank you in advance for any advice you are able to give.
