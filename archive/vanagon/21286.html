&gt;I don't think it will buy you anything but trouble to mount in the front.

Been runnin' with front mounted coolers on Bugs, Buses and now my '80 Wanagon
for years with little or no problems.  Love seein' the Oil Temp down where
it's supposed to be :)

The Vanagon is especially neat because it's mounted just inside the front
grille, where the radiator on the later Wasserboxers would go.  I use a 72
plate Mesa Style Cooler (Cross-flow type, not tube fin [obsolete] technology)
with copper lines.

Now if I could just find a decent tranny (goin' fast as of today) :(
