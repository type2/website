Subject: Re: 83' Worries Me


&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt;         Well, the server was down again so I was listless for a week. Sad.
&gt; But your all back again...and there was much rejoicing.
&gt;         So over the long weekend I ventured many many km from home with a
&gt; couple freinds in search of some good camping. We decided to go west, as
&gt; usual since east doesnt offer to many options, and ended up near Jasper.
&gt;         The highway ride was fine on the way there, although I did suck up
&gt; alot more fuel due to the fact I was carrying alot of water in the tank, 3
&gt; big guys, and a helluva alot o' gear. Where I started to worry bout the van
&gt; was after I had driven a good 70 hard km down a forestry road. It started
&gt; making a distinctive 'squeek' up at the front end. I had just installed new
&gt; brakes pads a day before, but it wasnt a brake sound, it was a wheel
&gt; turning sound (for lack of a better turn). A freind suggested that it may
&gt; be a bearing thats gone the way of the do-do, or maybe just some cruds in a
&gt; bad place. Any suggestions?????
&gt;         The second day we decided to go to another camp ground, since the
&gt; people who we were meeting there were unable to get a site, and buddies
&gt; girlfreind was whiney as hell. So much to my shagrin I was forced to drive
&gt; back out the &quot;hell road&quot;, west another 100km, and then 60km down ANOTHER
&gt; forestry road. So by this time the squeek had me going absolutely insane,
&gt; and since Ive gotten back I havent been able to diagnose it since Ive been
&gt; moving into my new pad, and am still waiting for my Bentely.
&gt;         So if you know what this may be please help me.

My '88 makes a loud squeak when hitting bumps on logging roads, but 
this is apparently a common suspension noise. You say yours is a 
'rotating' type noise? Does it occur on smooth roads, or is it 
related to suspension travel?
Sounds like a different noise, but just a thought...
