Subject: RE: A Father's Pride

        Those of us with children understand.  Those of us who work with 
        kids thank you for that simple act of bonding.
        
        Yesterday, I had in my office, a 16 year old high school junior 
        who had cursed at a school secretary when she refused to let him 
        use the phone.  What wasn't factored into the incident was the 
        fact that he and his 11 year old brother had spent the entire 
        morning in Sessions Court watching their parents tear into each 
        other trying to prove how unfit the other one was.  Both boys 
        were sent on to school while the hearing was continued.
        
        Under no circumstances can I condone or accept what he did.  We 
        talked about anger management, walking away, getting someone to 
        intervene, anything except cursing a lady old enough to be his 
        grandmother who was only doing her job.  He cried, oh God, did he 
        cry; this man-child literally did not know if he had a home or a 
        place to go.  When I finally got the problem sorted out, I 
        contacted the father, confirmed the custody order, and took him 
        home in Da Luv Bus.
        
        The 30 minute trip passed quickly.  He was fascinated by the bus, 
        the way it drove, shifting gears, and how &quot;slow go&quot; could be fun.  
        We talked about a lot of things; by the time we got there I told 
        him to take today to cool off and decompress.  We would talk 
        about his actions and the consequences (and whatever lessons he 
        missed) when he returned.  I made sure his Dad was there and went 
        on my way.  He knows when he comes back he is facing 3 days in 
        school suspension (working in the school cafeteria) but he called 
        today to apologize to the secretary, a sincere heartfelt apology 
        that caused both of them to weep.
        
        Your post struck a cord with me because I deal with kids who 
        are treated well and kids who are treated with cruelty.  Willow 
        is lucky; so is her dad.
        
        I apologize in advance for those who feel this is sentimental 
        crap but I feel as though I'm 300 years old right now.  I have 
        worked with kids for the past 28 years; some who succeeded 
        because of their background and many who succeeded in spite of 
        it.  But it's some of the failures that concern me.  I've often 
        wondered if a simple act of parental kindness could have made a 
        difference.
        
        The VW thread?  On the way home from the student's house, Da Luv 
        Bus' fuel pump went out on one of the busiest streets in this 
        area.  I lost a lot of gas, blocked traffic, and was loudly 
        cursed by Chrysler crapmobile drivers.  My son (16 and a newly 
        licensed Thing driver) finally arrived with the truck and tow bar 
        so I got it home about midnight where it will sit till this 
        weekend when I have time to fix it.
        
        Thanks for letting me vent.
