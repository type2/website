Helmut, ok, so tell me if i have this right -
a set of 4 plastic/rubber (not the Guidoish lookin chrome ones..  :&lt;) Vanagon
fender lips will cost $335 (US) total including shipping from Germany, and we
need to send the checks to Martha Rubin, right? When do the checks have to be
to Martha?? How long for the fender lips to be shipped to the US??

I'm assuming these are the white colored ones pictured on Coyotes vanagon_dot_com
site..right??

So, in assuming this, they are NOT the 2 piece (factory style) ones that are
pictured on that yellow syncro on Coyote's site also??......
(the factory ones appear to be fastened to the bottom edge of the door at
front, and to the body at rear, while the &quot;Winkler&quot; aftermarket ones just
screw/adhere to the fender lip on the body..)

and speaking of installation, do they screw to the body (drill holes..yuk..
 :&lt;O) or do they adhere with some sort of adhesive??

AND,... I still would like to know if the body mounted fender lips will
conflict with the fiberglass rocker trim found on the '88 '91 vanagon
GL/Carat etc...

Please advise all of us on this before we write checks for $335!!!!

thanks-
chris
