&gt;	There's nothing wrong with having an old car, especially old VW,
&gt;hobby, but be good to yourself and your hobby. THREE cars that don't work
&gt;isn't a hobby, its a job. Your heart may be bigger than your tool box.

And wallet.

Me, I could prolly afford to drive some new, air-conditioned, power-windowed
beast,  or some such crap, but I prefer to use the '56 as my daily driver.
