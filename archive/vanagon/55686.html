Subject: Re: Hello from a newbie

&gt;The question:  Just to the left of the heater controls (between the heater
&gt;controls and the steering column) there is a hole in the dash with an
&gt;aluminum thing in it.  At the back is an electrical contact (hot).  This is
&gt;not the cig lighter, which is on the other side of the heater controls.  In
&gt;the owner's manual on the diagram of the dash, this is shown as a circle,
&gt;but not labeled.  What is this?

newbies ask this question SO many times, that there is a FAQ for it.
