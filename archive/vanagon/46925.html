Subject: Re: Any advice on cleaning Westy curtains?

I, having purchased a diesel Westy, soaked my curtains for 4 hours and then
washed them 3 times in the washer and the final rinse was finally reasonably
clean, but the first two times the water was REALLY muddy.  I wouldn't say
they came out beautiful, but they're a heck of a lot better than they were! 

I dried them on the line.
