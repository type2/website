Subject: '87 Wf overheated on fwy; tank dry

Hi Volks,

A really elementary question, with which I would appreciate some help:

Temps have been in the 90s in NoCA until the past couple of days :) and a
loud fan has come on a number of times, usually on surface streets.  Usually
running the A/C.  At first, i thot the accelerator was stuck, and tried
stomping it down.  Then thot it was something to do with the A/C, so turned
it off but of course, that was of no immediate help, tho probably related
due to overworking the engine.  Then, i thot maybe it was the rapid or
surging idle i've read about with some '87s.  After reading recent posts, I
gather that the fan is part of the design, when the engine is overheating.

The other day, the fan came on and didn't stop.  At a long traffic signal, i
turned off the ignition, and then turned it back on--no change.  Slow-witted
[blamed on heat and anoxia &lt;low O2 to brain&gt;], i turned off the A/C.
Finally, it occurred to me to look at the temp. gauge, and Yikes!!! it was
all the way to the extreme right edge of the dial.  I was almost home, so
just took it as easy as possible for the last couple of blocks.  I looked in
behind the license plate, and the water tank was completely empty.  

I asked that all the fluids and systems be checked along with an oil change
at the local VW dealer before a 1500-mi camping trip at the end of May.  The
engine was  reportedly rebuilt in 9/96, perhaps 10-15k ago.  I have never
observed any water leaks on the ground.  The red indicator light does come
on at ignition [flashes on &amp; off, then goes off], but has never come on
while driving.

My question is, Where do I start?  

Because of all the discussion on the list of just the right coolant, etc.,
and since i managed to make it home, i hesitated to just fill up the tank
with water.  I have a Bentley manual, if someone wants to refer to that.

Will appreciate any suggestions.  I've hesitated even to drive it because
it's been so hot here, the the weekend has been beautiful and moderate.

Thanks in advance,

Gail
