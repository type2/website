Subject: 61 356 Project FS

In line with the policy of passing on the possibly interesting to the
possibly interested we have advertised for the first time today

'61 Porsche 356 Project, $1500 (206) 839-9392


That's Seattle again.  Don't know anything about the car except its cheaper
than yer typical deluxe bus project!
