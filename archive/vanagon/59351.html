Hey all,
I'm forwarding this on behalf of a fellow named Duncan Paul Fagg.  The
below is what he's asking.  I sent him a message begging him to get the
proper air-cooled engine for his Bus, but I don't know if he will or
not.  At any rate, he's apparently not subscribed, tho I recommended to
him that with this type of project, he should be.  Send all responses to
him at dpf1_at_st-andrews.ac_dot_uk .  Do NOT send it to me.  If you do, I will
send it right back with a really nasty letter :-) 

Sean


&gt; 
&gt; Dear Sean, I am a pre '73 bus owner planning an engine swap to a diesel
&gt; vanagon engine.  I wondered if you could be kind enough to post these
&gt; questions on the watercool list for me.
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; dunc
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Apart from the turbo unit, are there other differences between the turbo
&gt; diesel and diesel engines?  What are the fuel economy figures I could
&gt; expect from each?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) There are a lot of folk who have said 'there are no differences
&gt; between the vanagon and golf diesel units'.  However, whenever I have
&gt; been able to nose around a golf diesel engine bay, the engine seems very
&gt; tall vertically, whilst to my knowledge the vanagon unit is not.  Am I
&gt; wrong, or are these two engines fundamentally different? 
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Has anyone tried the diesel unit in a pre '73 van, does it fit in
&gt; without trimming the engine bay sides?  Does it mate to the trans?
&gt; (People in Britain sell a golf or passat engine to pre '79 bus trans
&gt; adapter, however they don't say anything about a vanagon diesel engine. 
&gt; The CT petrol case fits to the trans off a '73.  Therefore does the
&gt; vanagon diesel?
&gt; 
&gt; Basically this reiterates my previous question, is the golf
&gt; diesel different to the vanagon diesel?
&gt; 
&gt; Please help I am drowning in waterworld!
&gt; 
&gt; dunc
&gt;
