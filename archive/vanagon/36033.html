Dennis,

Would it be enough to replace the thin (originally) green and black o-rings
on the outside of each end of the cylinder sleeve to reduce the seepage?  Or,
would it really depend on the condition of wear between the end of the
cylinder and the head?  And, could this be fixed with machine work and
indexing rings in the head?
