Subject: RE: 1988 Syncros?

&gt;I am curious to find out if anyone has a definitive answer as to whether or
&gt;not VW sold Vanagon Syncros in the United States for model year 1988.

While I was searching for a Syncro I found out from an owner of an '87
Syncro that VW did not import any Syncros in the United States.  He said
he had wanted to buy an '88 when they were new but the dealerships only
had '87 Syncros.  The dealers told him VW could not get enough Syncro
specific components to produce enough '88 Syncros to cover all markets
so they elected not to bring any into the U.S.  I think he said it was the
shortage of the viscous coupler being made by one of VW's vendors.

This '87 Syncro owner ended up buying a new '87 Syncro from a Minneapolis
dealer after being told '88's would not be available.  Either this is true or the
dealerships were trying to fill people with a line to get them to buy the '87 Syncros
they still had on their lots.
