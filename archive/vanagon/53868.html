Subject:       Re: 5K on new heads....

&gt; Seems to run a little bit hotter with the new heads (or else it's just 
&gt; the dino oil). I've changed it once already, but I'm going back to 
&gt; synthetic (probably Mobil 1 again) at the 150K mark (6.5K miles from the 
&gt; head install).

Just curious - did you use Mobil 1 since the van was new (and hence 
the good shape of the pistons/cyls)?

&gt; PS--I put new speakers in the front doors, which stick out 1/4 inch from 
&gt; the panels. I'm afraid to bend and break the window cranks, so I just 
&gt; loosened them a little and turn them carefully to avoid scraping the new 
&gt; speakers. Anybody have a better suggestion? Or should I warm the cranks 
&gt; up and try to bend them just a little bit?
