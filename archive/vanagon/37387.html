Subject: What's this wire.... ('88)

In trying to track down the source of my idle surge &amp; lurching, I 
found two wires near the coil which appear to go together:

They both have single yellow connectors, one male, one female. Both 
sprout from the harness along with the driver's side injector wires. 
One is white with light green stripe, other is Grey with White 
stripe. 

Should these be connected, or are they just unused wires for some 
option?
