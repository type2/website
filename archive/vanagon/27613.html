&gt;sliding side doors were standard equipment on 68 and later busses.   They
&gt;were an option earlier than that,  actually in 1963.   I've seen two 64
&gt;sliding door, sliding sunroof standard microbuses in green and white  ( my
&gt;favorite bus colour combo).  I have also seen a wienee wagon with the 
sliding
&gt;door on the drivers side.   All three were European sold and had locking
&gt;steering columns.  I've seen a picture of a 21-window with sliding doors on
&gt;BOTH sides.


I once saw a splittie (don't know the year) in Frisco, Colorado
with double hinged doors on BOTH drivers side and passengers side.
Yup, a 7-door bus! Or 8 if you count the engine hatch.
