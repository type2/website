Subject:      How can I tell what year? Thanks to all,I now know!

How can I verify the year of my vanagon?  I assume that it's somewhere in
the serial number on the dash.  Thanks in advance.



Thanks to all who answered my request for help.  I now know that my &quot;baby&quot;
was born in the year 1994 in Hanover, Germany, and that it had 24,220
siblings at the time of birth!  It's parents were named Volkswagen.  It's
genetic makeup resulted in it's phenotype being one of a multi-purpose
vehicle of the Vanagon type, and it's muscle power comes from a 4-cylinder
gasoline (water-cooled) engine.  It's immune system incorporates a passive
restraint system called seat belts.

I should also announce to it's family of Vanigons that it survived the
surgery of having it's engine replaced, and is now feeling much better.
Thanks for all your support and letters of encouragement during this
stressful time.

It still has to undergo minor medical outpatient treatment to have it's
heater fan motor replaced and AC recharged.  Then it should be good for
another 150K miles.  It plans to visit some of its relatives in the very
near future.

The baby's sliding windows were also repaired so they don't squeak and give
everyone &quot;goose bumps&quot;.  If anyone needs the part number of the nylon
slides or the grease that worked, let me know.

George in Columbus, GA
