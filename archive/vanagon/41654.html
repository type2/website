Well, hey!  Thanks for the info...

Just to let you know...the thing does run well, as it should, for it only has 
40K on *rebuilt* engine....he said that he burned the heads and did a top-end 
job on it...I have the heads, so I'll inspect them for missing metal! 
		**Perhaps a little late?**

I don't know my compression (SHAME SHAME SHAME) 'cuz I don't have a tester, nor 
have I ever been so technical with my cars that I wanted to know the &quot;real&quot; 
situaton.  At least it sounds good, just as it should, and has no lack of power 
HA HA HA...that is, for a FI'd Westy...but the chunks worried me...I figure it 
may be good to be building another engine anyway....what is the best size for me 
to upgrade to without going hotrod (that's what my 280 Z is for) but to make it 
less of a strain in the mountains with gear/people/boat(s)?  I would like to 
stay within the limits of my fuel injection system, but I feel that it might be 
good to have a broader power range...any hints?

Look for our posting on whales!
