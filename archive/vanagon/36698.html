Subject: Re: ref Thom's 'family tree'

Austin axed:
&gt;Whatsit mean if yer famly tree don't fork or have enny splits?

It means you have at least three watercooled vanagons in your front yard 
sitting up on blocks....and you live in an aircooled vanagon (also up on 
blocks) 'cause it has a gas heater (it just puts out only a little CO)..BUT
ya only drive the 'Westy&quot; once a week to church to impress the 
neighbors...and the &quot;Westy&quot; has clear plastic seatcovers on every seating 
surface (your family refers to the 'Westy' as the parlor)...

You use the words &quot;spouse&quot; and &quot;sibling&quot; interchangably...

Joel is in your family tree in at least 5 places 
(w/appologees to Mr. J. Walker from Allybammah)

You voted TWICE for Pat Buchanan in the 1996 Lewiseanna primemary.
