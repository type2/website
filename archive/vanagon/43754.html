Subject: Strange Westy Layout ('71 STOCK)

I pulled all the plywood from the roof of my westy recently before
painting. I plan to sand and refinish these.  

In my Westy, there's a different bed than I've seen in that year model.
I'm used to the cot being up there; instead, mine has a full matress-type
piece that fits all the way across the opening at the top. I've heard of
this in later year models, but when I removed my plywood, I was happy to
find the stock anchoring system in place, indicating to me that:

a. someone went to great lengths to do the job right (not likely
considering the Sears latex paint on the roof and wall panels).

b. I have a very unique layout for the '71 westy.

I'd be interested in hearing whether anyone else has seen this sort
of bunk in a '71.

Thanks! Joe
