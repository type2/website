&gt; or 110 VAC (330 Hz) _at_ 150 W

So why is everybody so afraid of this 330Hz? I agree, don't test it
on your laptop (to expensive experiment), (and stay away from that 650V DC), 
but I don't see why feeding a standard E or ring core transformer 330Hz 
instead of 50 or 60 would be such a big deal. Sure, lossess due to hysteresis
would be slightly higher, but the risk of saturating the core would
be less. I have used standard power supply E-core transformers up
to several kHz without any problem.

Things that might not work so well is anything that tries to do
something with the AC directly, eg the timing in simple &quot;dimmer&quot; type
circuits may not work very well. Also, AC motors may burn out easily.
Typical electric drill motors would work fine though.
