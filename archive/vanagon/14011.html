Subject: Re[2]: 6v wipers on 12v bus

Please send me a wiring diagram.  I am assuming that this is something I could 
use for a 6-volt gas gauge and possibly a clock as well?  Thanks!

It is very easy to produce a solid state 12-6v converters, and cheaply too.  
parts are
1 power transistor
1 zener diode
1 resistor
1 heat sink 
that is it!  we are talking about less than 5 bucks here, kids!  The power 
transistor is rated to carry 15 amperes, but I don't think the thing will 
supply that much.  5~10 amperes is closer.  

I built a similar one for 12-9v for a portable cd player and the thing is 
simple, but works great.

I'll send the circuit to anyone who wants.
