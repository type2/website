Subject: leaning Westfalia

Hi all!

My '86 Westfalia has begun to lean towards the drivers side. It's been 
gradually getting lower on the left, but still handles fine with even 
tire wear.

My mechanic says the springs are sagging. Cost to replace (VW OEM, with 
labor): $1,100. GULP! He says the only after market spring that he knew 
about were the same price.

Any brilliant ideas out there in Vanagon-land?
