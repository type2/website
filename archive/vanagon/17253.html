&gt;From: Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; does KYB even make shocks for vanagons?? that's one of the problems with
&gt; non-vw shocks: finding someone that makes them. Koni makes them in Holland,
&gt; but few dealers want to import them over here (it seems).

Yes, they do.  We have the GR2s on the front and the Gas-A-Justs on the rear
of our 85 vanagon.  We got them at a FLAPS but I can't remember how much they
cost.  You don't need to have any of the special tools to replace the fronts
as the bentley book requires.
