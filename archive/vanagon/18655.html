Steve Johnson coughed up:
&gt; &gt; My '86 Westfalia has begun to lean towards the drivers side. It's been 
&gt; &gt; gradually getting lower on the left, but still handles fine with even 
&gt; &gt; tire wear.
[snip]

&gt; I have this sag too.... maybe we can trade springs from opposite sides? ;p
&gt; (I take the passenger side ones from your's... okay? ;) )

Hmmm.  I see 2 Jenny Craig candidates....
