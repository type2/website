So Alice C. Gibb says:

&gt; I have just gone from being a wannabus person to a vanagon person!  My
&gt; husband and I just bought an '81 vanagon camper with about 130,000 miles on

Congratulations!!  You're are now amoung the elite Type II owners.  So hold
your nose real high now.  ;)  Not quite as elite as if you had bought a
'91 GL, but definitely a cut above the rest! ;P  You even could've made
the ultimate mistake and bought a ...ahem... Eurovan... (murmers rumble
through the crowd) but through wisdom and evidently precise frugality, you
made it through to a wise choice never-the-less.  (For those of you who are
humor impaired, the EV remark is, of course, aimed at a certain person that
lives somewhere's along the Eastern seaboard if ya know what I mean) ;) 
Harrr Matey!!  

Anyway, I don't know why you are so worried about all these minor details.
You've got to worry about more important things like writing VW songs and
poems and be able to make up meanings for acronyms like T.G.I.F. and such,
you can't be worrying about trivial things such as odometers and gas gauges!
Boy, I tell ya, these rookies.....   

&gt; 
&gt; 1) The odometer is apparently &quot;sticking&quot; - it still rolls over, but not
&gt; incredibly accuartely.  Has anyone had this probem?  Does anyone know a
&gt; soloution?
&gt; 

Well, if you must.  I'd start by checking the speedometer cable connection.
Is the speedometer itself accurate?  You will have to pull off the top
for access to the speedometer.  It comes off pretty easy.  I really don't
know what else you would do other than make sure of a good cable connection.
You may need to replace the speedo itself which can be had from a wrecking
yard.  I'm sure some of these other yutz's can be of better assistance. ;) 

&gt; 2) The fuel level sensor isn't working (in combination with the odometer
&gt; this is a real problem).  Again, does anyone know how to fix it?

The float in the tank may be no good or the contacts on the sender in
the float unit may be bad.  But check the electrical connections before
you go after the sender/float unit.  Again I'm not sure how to get to 
the tank yet since I haven't tackled it on a Vanagon yet.  Am I helpful
so far.  ;)

&gt; 3) Where can you order replacement parts for the camping stuff?  We need a
&gt; replacement front table and back window screen.

Wrecking yards are by far the best (first) place to search for these special
goodies for your baby.  And while you're out there, if you find another
'81, snatch up all the other things you can grab so that when they go on
yours, you'll have them.  

&gt; 
&gt; 5)  The van came with the original manuals and a &quot;Haynes&quot; manual.  Is this
&gt; a good one to use?  Can we do repairs ourselves with this manual?

Haynes? Haynes?? Who's this Haynes guy anyway?  You can probably get by 
with the Haynes for minor maintenance but I trust the Bentley for good
detailed diagrams and pictures.  It's a bit pricey, but hey, it's a VW.

&gt; 
&gt; 6)  We are in Orange County (Irvine) can anyone reccomend a good mechanic
&gt; in the area?  A good junkyard/salvage place where we might get spare parts
&gt; for cheap?

Go 10 miles from anywhere and then turn left.  Go straight for 20 blocks
then make a right, then follow the road tell ya get to.....Ah never mind.
I have no idea.....

&gt; 
&gt; I guess that's enough questions for now.  Thanks in advance for anyone who
&gt; answers this post.

ZZZZZzzzzzzzz.......
