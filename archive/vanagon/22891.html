Howdy!

	Bug O' Rama is coming in a couple of months, and I have a
question about showing a vehicle.

	Now, my bus isn't anywhere near being show condition, but I've
seen busses in the show area that looked _worse_!  Like primer'd busses
with nasty dents in them!

	I'm thinking about parking my bus in the show area, but I'm not
sure what's involved.  Do you _have_ to leave it all open for the
world to climb in?  Is there a class for cars in progress?

	If anything else, it sure would beat having to park in the 
boondockers!
