&gt;Does this oil warning system have an electronic 
&gt;noisemaker that  sounds different from anything else? 
&gt;My Corrado made a funny electronic  noise when I was 
&gt;autocrossing, and I could never figure out why. (Not  
&gt;that I've ever read the user's manaual cover to 
&gt;cover...) It only made the noise as I went through the 
&gt;start/finish line, at WAY HIGH  rpm, cornering very 
&gt;hard. It wasn't in a situation where I'd take  my eyes 
&gt;off the road, or slow down :-)

That wasn't an electronic alarm.

That was your car screaming in panic.
