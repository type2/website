&gt; &gt; Hi Pattie.  Yes, in Canada, these were available.  There's a 
&gt; &gt; few in the Vancouver area alone.

&gt; &gt; &gt; A few years ago I saw an ad for a Synchro Crew Cab pickup and wondered if
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone else has heard of this and if it was ever imported into the U.S.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; think the ad appeared in a Northern California nickel want ad type
&gt; &gt; &gt; publication.

&gt; There was one that showed up at some of the  vw shows here on the east 
&gt; coast this past summer. It was from canada and can be seen in db&amp;hvw.
