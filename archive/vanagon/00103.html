Joel querries as to what what a Kombi is...

I believe that Kombi is short for Kombination...at least in the
early busses, Kombi's were one step higher in the model range
than the plain, window-less delivery van. They had three windows
on either side of the passenger compartment, usually cloth seats
and trim.

The idea for the kombi was that you could use it as a delivery vad
oops van during the week and use it as a family car on weekends.
