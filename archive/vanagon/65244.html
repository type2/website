Subject:      Audi Hubcaps (free)

I have four 14&quot; Audi hubcaps for the taking, they're the silver plastic
with the &quot;spokes&quot; around the perimeter and the Audi emblem-four
interlocking circles-in the center.  I don't know what the VW hubcaps that
everyone is looking for are like , but these may be similar. And for the
purist, they have a little VW emblem on the back.  They were on my 84 Westy
when I bought it. A little used but they are free to anyone interested.
I'm in the DC area.

Scott
