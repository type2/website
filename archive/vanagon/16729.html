&gt; Don't even bother trying to get the right hose, even if you fix it it never
&gt; worked right to begin with.

Actually, my washer system is one of the few things that works well.  I
pumped it up at the beginning of summer two summers ago, forgot about it
as I stored it outside through a winter up here in the great white north,
(we're talkin' -35c) and was able to continue using it for most of the
next summer without pumping it up.  I suppose it's never safe to
stereotype a VW van.
