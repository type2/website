Subject: Re: Gas mileage

&gt;
&gt;My '87 Westy, 2.1 L wasserboxer engine, is getting only 17 mpg
&gt;highway.  That seems low to me.  Is it typical for the rest of you
&gt;guys with vans of similar age and equipment?
&gt;
&gt;One contributing factor might be that it has the wrong tires --
&gt;205/70R14 car tires, max load 1400 pounds.  It should have light-truck
&gt;tires, like the ones it was shipped with.  And having the wrong tires
&gt;often means lousy gas mileage.

HI John,
     17 MPG seems to be on the low end of the mileage range.  I have an '86
Syncro with 215R7014.  I usualy get about 18 to 21 mpg.  I drive fairly flat
roads at speeds of 65 to 75 mph.  In town  it  is about 15 to 17 mpg.  With
the family all aboard with luggage for a week, I still get about 18 mpg
driving through the Ozarks.  The Syncros weigh 3680lbs, according to the
registration.  The window sticker says 16 city and 18 highway.  I keep my
tires aired up to the max inflation.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
