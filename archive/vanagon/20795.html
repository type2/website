Subject: vehicle names

     I'll call my bus... &quot;bus&quot;
     
     it's a loonngg story...
     
     a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
     
     I drove a FIAT (still do but it's a different one). One day I
     decided to give it a name - I called it Christine (yeah, I watched the 
     movie and thought hmm, great name for a car). I said (as you do) to 
     Christine &quot;give me a sign that you like the name I gave you&quot;...
     
     ... later that day the cam belt snapped when the engine was running.
     
     not a pretty sight.
     
     no more vehicle names since then.
     
     Lee.
