&gt; To make a long story short, they put in another Brazilian fuel pump and it
&gt; failed. They lifted the car using the sink drain as a support and tore that
&gt; up (and fixed it). Gave me an '87 Jetta to drive around and paid for my
&gt; hotels. Finally, they put in a German fuel pump and it's still working
&gt; today. &lt;knock knock&gt; on wood.

Ditto....fuel pump problems and solution during cross country!
