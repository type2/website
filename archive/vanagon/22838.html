So Lisa Quinn says:
&gt; Hello All! Sorry, I didn't realize it was porper to introduce yourself
&gt; to the list, so here goes: I'm Lisa Quinn, from Novelty, Ohio. (East
&gt; of Cleveland OH). I'm a graphic artist. My husband is Bob Muehl, who
&gt; is an engineer. He tests big motors that are used on Navy ships. He's
&gt; a pretty good mechanic, who has taught me alot. I always wanted to be
&gt; able to take care of my car, and so I do. We are the sometimes proud
&gt; owner of a 1981 Vanagon L Westphalia Deluxe Camper. It has the stove
&gt; and refrigerator in it. It ran well until it's death at 144,441 miles.
&gt; And you all know well the saga of our engine replacement, and it's
&gt; untimely death at 1,500 miles. I am the previous proud owner of a
&gt; '66 Beetle, and a '68 Autostick Beetle. Both were daily drivers, and 
&gt; done in by the Cleveland salt in the winter. Oh yes, forgot to say
&gt; that the Camper is brown. Thanks again for all your help.
&gt; Lisa

Porper to give an introduction!!???  My God!!! I'm REALLY late with
this one!!  ;))))

Hi there!!!

I'm (pronounced Am) Steven Johnson or &quot;Ratboy&quot; as Martha seems to
like to indicate.  I blame the name on Ric though.  It's from an
ooooolllllddd post about rats eatin' someones antifreeze coated
hoses.  That's okay, you'll see Ric and I make seeminly rude exchanges
occasionally, and that's the way we like it, so get over it. ;p

Anyway, I live in Sacramento and have a '91 Camper and my wife has
a '86 Sentra (don't blame the Sentra on me cause it's her choice!)
I joined this list when Unca Gerry got it goin' and was in the
previous list which took one hell of an effort to get on, but thanks
to Unca Joel, I was on that list for a few months until it lost its
gonads and went south.  

You won't see me post as often as I used to because my latest job
requires oodles of attention and I can just bare skim the articles
and only do small posts like this one.

Speaking of etiquette, if you recieve help from someone, be sure to
thank them.  You don't have to do it publically, you can just email
them directly.  If you want to thank several people, then it's easier
to post it to the list.  I have no complaints in the being thanked
department, but just want you-all to be aware, just in case you don't
know.  

I appreciate ALL the help from everyone that has helped me with my
VW problems and especially Gerry S. for making this bulletin board
possible.

Cheers!

Steven
