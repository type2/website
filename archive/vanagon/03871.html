Gawdamned Southern, Cousin Marryin' Scum Unka' Joel Slanderously Said:
&gt;ok, Ric....

Gee I get blamed for everything...hell, I've been nice for a week or so...

Unka Joel also said:
&gt;Defender of the Right to Marry Your Cousin
&gt;(or a good looking pig, if you can find one)

To which I reply...

Do you know why men marry women?

'Cause sheep can't cook!


There, I've stopped being good! Joel started it....it's not my fault...
blame Joel, yep that't it...

In the immortal words of Paul &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; Hogan:

Australia......where men are men....


and sheep are terrified!




Tastelessly,

Ric
