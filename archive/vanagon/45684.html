Thanks for the info., though I guess I should of added the fact that I do
work for a public utility, PSE&amp;G, so I do understand the operation , use and
setup of gas appl.. According to all the service manuals 1 or 2 sizes drill
sizes can normally be accommodated , though an adjustment must be made at the
air shutter. I was really trying to find out if any has had any experience
with increasing the gas flow. 

             Thanks 
              Kris
