Subject: Pop Top canvas&amp; seals

Hi Michael,
    Just read your post about pop top canvas for pe 68 campers.  'VW
canvas' in Cordell Texas makes top quality canvas for pre-68 and newer
Buses. They're real nice and you can order the canvas with extra windows if
desired. Call Ernest _at_ (512) 926-6195  You can find the ad on page 97, Hot
VW's March '96 issue.
   If your looking for a good seal at a good price, try 'Pop top campers'
in Malibu CA.  They make a nice seal that will last longer than the bus.
Pre-68 seals only $48.  Call (800) 248-2719.  Check out their ad on page
124, March '96 Hot VW's.    I've used products from both companys and I
don't think you'll find anything better.   Limbo used to get free shipping
with any order from Poptop Campers, ask and find out.  Sounds like a
advertisment,Anyway hope it helps.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
