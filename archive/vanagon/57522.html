As a new list member I see alot about our friends to the south doing the =
camping seen.  What about us in the northwest??  Its the only place I =
have ever been to that I can pull up to a stop light and see 3 other =
vanagons sitting with me! So why dont we start a little group up here??  =
If anybody wants to get together email me at mickeyd_at_iswnet_dot_com or post =
it on the list.  I do a lot of fishing, biking and white water rafting =
with my weekender and would like to meet fellow brick campers as well.=20
