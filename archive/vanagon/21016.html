Subject: Re: Replacing bolts


%%On my '71 bus the
%%Bentley says to replace the rear engine carrier bolts.  These are the
%%ones holding the brace across the back.  Should the four main
%%nuts/bolts also be replaced?  Anything else?

%%(James Brill)

I've reused mine without a problem.  But those bushes (y'know--the big 
square rubber ones), maybe those oughtta go.
