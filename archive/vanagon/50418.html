Subject: BA6 heater question and FS


Hi All,
I have recently acquired a BA6 heater from a junker Vanagon.   I pulled the
entire setup including the fan, hearter furnace, all wiring up to dash
including dash switch, pump, coil, thermostat, ducting including the 
re-circulatory pieces under the bench seat.  It is in good condition and
appears functional. (Not all rusted out or burnt.)   

I was wondering if anyone had any insight into installing this into a
Vanagon or bus  without a previous heater. How complicated is it?  Is there
a simple way to test the system out of the vehicle.  I'm sure I can test
the blower but would like to check the furnace operation and switches.  

Also I will be selling this and was wondering what a fair price would be? 
Any help is gratefully appreciated.  Email me at 72114.723_at_compuserve_dot_com
if you are interested in acquiring this beast.  I would like to get rid of
it soon and I am sure someone with cold feet could put it to good use this
winter.
