Somewhere I once read what the rpm should be at the various shift 
points for a 1600dp.  I now cannot find this.  I have scoured Muir, 
Bentley and Haynes.  Maybe I just missed it.  This weekend I strung 
some wire to the front so I could us my tach/dwell meter on the road. 
I am running about 3,700 rpm at a timed 60 mph.  This is on 185/75-14 
tires.  '71 bus.  Which brings up the next question to which I can 
find no answer.  What was the stock tire size for this beast?  
Currently my speedo reads 72 at 60 so I am guessing these tires are a 
little too small.  Thanks, Jim
