Subject: Re: Starter, Pilot Bearing

&gt;The starter seems weak while cranking. It is getting worse.
&gt;Lately, it not even cranking fast enough to start the engine. I've checked
&gt;all ground straps and cleaned battery connections,and it is a new battery.
&gt;Alternator also seems to be fine and accessories are strong. Is a &quot;tired&quot;
&gt;starter a typical way for them to quit? Or is a weak connection likely??
&gt;How important is it to replace it w/ a Bosch or will reman. do?

A starter can start drawing excessive current when it goes bad, thereby 
having trouble turning the motor (and quickly killing your battery).  If 
you have eliminated all other possibilities, this may be your problem.  
Some garages can load-test a starter for you.  Sears used to do it for 
free, whether or not you bought a starter from them.  This means they test 
the current draw when the starter is engaged to see if it is drawing more 
than it should be.  To answer your other question, even the Bosch starter 
is remanufactured, but by Bosch rather than by by someone else.  I have 
other reman starter brands that are cheaper than Bosch (and carry a 
lifetime warranty), but personally I would only but a Bosch in my own 
Vanagon.  If I recall correctly, Bosch's warrantee is two years rather than 
lifetime, but includes free towing if it fails during that period.
