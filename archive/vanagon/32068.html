Subject: EV coolant loss (don't let it be so)

OK, all you aircooled folks, be kind.

Been noticing coolant loss on my '93 EV over the last week.  No visible
drips but the level in the expansion container drops approx. 1/2 - 1
inch per day.  It's going to the dealer Monday, and I'm hoping it's
something very simple, or something covered by the 50K drivetrain warrranty
(in that case it wouldn't be simple - head gasket).  I'll have to check the 
rear heater more carefully for drips as I've been using that alot lately.
The pan under the engine doesn't make drip-looking easy unfortunately.

Any EV owners out there aware of anything obvious I should be checking
before I submit to the dealer (cringe).  

Thanks, 
rob
