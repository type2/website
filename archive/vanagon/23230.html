Subject: subtract one from the stats

It was a sad moment for me, but last weekend I sold my '73 westy so that I'd
have enough bread to buy a bug from my friend.  He had a '72 bug with 48,000
original miles on it.  I couldn't believe the condition this car was in and
when he told me he was selling it I had to have it.  Everything is original:
 seat upholstery, paint, engine, even the muffler!  It does have one pesky
little thing about it that bugs me though.  Maybe someone can help me out.
 After I drive the car and get the engine nice and warm and then park
somewhere for say 15-30 minutes, I have a hard time starting it.  It just
turns over and over and over for about 30 seconds (sometimes longer) before
coming to life.  I haven't really messed around with it yet.  I'm sure it's
no big deal, but any ideas for things to look for would be appreciated.  By
the way, I still have my '63 kombi which is close to running now.  I will be
finishing up the engine this week or next, and I can't wait to hear it run!
 It's been over a year since I bought it, and I've had very little time to
work on it, but hopefully this year I'll be able to finish the restoration.
 It's gonna be one very cool bus.  Thanks in advance for any help with my
starting problem.
