I'm forwarding this question from r.a.vw's.  I though maybe
someone on this list could respond.

&gt; I am posting this for a friend without net access. We have read
&gt; the faq's for rec.autos.vw and find no mention of the problem -
&gt; HELP -
&gt; 
&gt; 	I have an 89 Vanagon with auto. transmission. 
&gt; 	Milage is 100k km. The flex plate failed. 
&gt; 	A replacement did the same after driving only 2 miles. 
&gt; 	Is a completely new transmission necessary or is it possible 
&gt; 	to replace just the flex plate,torque converter, and final 
&gt; 	drive only? It is also important to note that the bell housing 
&gt; 	was cracked in 3 or 4 places and had been so for quite a long 
&gt; 	time by all appearances. It had to be welded back together 
&gt; 	during the attempted repair. 
&gt; 
&gt; PS Second question same vanagon
&gt; 
&gt; 	When the knob for the fridge is switched to the 
&gt; 	battery function the parking brake warning light 
&gt; 	comes on and a loud/grinding-scraping noise is 
&gt; 	heard in the engine compartment. What's going on?
&gt; 
&gt; Please reply by email to me and I can forward the advice/suggestions.
&gt; Thanks in advance.
