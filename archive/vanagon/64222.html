I had intended my original response to be to the list.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Greetings to all:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Second owner of 84 Westy in need of a replacement refrig.  The
&gt;&gt; &gt;origninal, as we all know was like a fine women; Kind but Tempermental!
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Mine has been that was and has finally quit on all three circuits.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Anyone have suggestions for a modern replacement?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Frankly, I'm more interested in your finding a &quot;modern replacement&quot; for your
&gt;&gt; *analogy* -- I know this is a predominantly male list, but can we just
&gt;&gt; dispense with the &quot;temperamental women&quot; nonsense?  Usually, it's much less
&gt;&gt; blatant, and sometimes, refreshingly, not even there.  %-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At the same time, I wish you luck in finding a less costly solution, such as
&gt;&gt; the recharge mentioned by another list member.
