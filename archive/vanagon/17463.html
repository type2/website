if you are really running 10W30 oil, and the weather has been really warm
of late, i'd suspect that more than most else.

IF the oil got too thin, then there wouldn't be anything wrong with the
pump or the engine (since you shut down pretty quickly). i'd change to the
20W50 and see if it ever happens again (real helpful, huh?) ...

my bet is that it won't happen with 20W50.
