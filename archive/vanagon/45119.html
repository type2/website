Subject: Re: Fuel pump relay, where is it?

Thanks to all of you that sent me info on the fuel pump relay. You all
confirmed our suspisions that the &quot;double relay&quot; on the firewall it the
correct one. Going to clean it up tonight, and see if that fixes the
problem. Hope that we get The Good Old Van back on the road tonight.
