So Tim Smith says:
&gt; to give him some money soon as he gets back from winter working in USA....
&gt; so I'm holding my breath on this. Guys been gone 4 months, due back this
&gt; months end. No keys/test drive, sigh. 
&gt; 
&gt; Wish me luck.  This should finish my SOs objections over buying another van,
&gt; she can't/won't drive a standard, sooooo..... ;&gt;.

Tim,

I didn't see any price quote in there.  Do you have any idea what it's being
sold for?  I know a certain Unca Joel that is probably seathing over this
one.....  ;)
