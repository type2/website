Subject: What do people do w/their cracked Cylinder heads?

I have a cracked cylinder head and would like to solicit creative
uses for it.  So far, I have come up with:

1) Taping a business reply card to it from some junk mailer and
        dropping it in the mailbox.

2) Using it for a boat anchor

3) putting it in my aluminum curbside recycling bin

4) Putting it on a pedestal in my living room as a work of art

5) Dragging it in back of a car marked &quot;just married&quot;


Im getting a top-end rebuild on my 82 Vanagon engine this week.... fun!
