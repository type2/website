&gt;&gt; &gt; A while back their was a thread regarding &quot;interchangability&quot; of vanagon
&gt;&gt; &gt; driver and passenger seats with other car seats, ie. Audi 4000?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Any more info? Anybody installed non-stock seats?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I just got done doing it, and I don't think there are very many seats
&gt;&gt; that will bolt right in.  I had to mount boards to the floor (which is
&gt;&gt; not actually the floor but the raised platform that the seats sit on)
&gt;&gt; and bolt the seats to the boards.  It wasn't really all that hard, just
&gt;&gt; time consuming.  Oh, and the seats are higher than the VW ones, which were
&gt;&gt; very flat.  I think this is typical of &quot;other&quot; seats.

&gt;What seat did you put in? How higher are they? Does your head now rub
&gt;against the headliner? #:) How tall are you?
&gt;Enquiring minds want to know.

yeah i would like to know too. BTW has anybody tried swapping seats in a
pre 68' bus? I am definitely not going to drill holes to accomplish this.
What i am planning to do is bolt some different seat to the seat existing
seat frames. Basically i am planning on bolting some seats out of a 85'
Accord on to some spare seat frames i have for my 65' bus. Anybody done
this, or have a better idea?
