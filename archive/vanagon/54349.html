&gt;I continue:
&gt;Sorry, I've seen the little thumwheel style knobs there for heated seats and
&gt;this is not anything like a thumwheel.  It looks like a little electronic
&gt;display of some sort.
&gt;
&gt;Any other theories????

Did you notice if it was a US model or not?

I guess no chance of going back and trying to find the owner. 

Where were the digital displays mounted for the BBW 46  CDN Eberspacher
watercooled gas heater?

Hey Tim Smith - you've got a BBW 46 (you lucky dog!!)  Where is the digital
display mounted?

I  think we've exhausted all logical options. 

Here's something illlogical.....

My Audi turbo has a trip computer kind of deal that was only offered on the
turbo/quattro models. Could it have been some sort of option like that?

did it have any little buttons on it?

this one's a real stumper.
