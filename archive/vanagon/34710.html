&gt; I'm shortly going to be in the market for a new Mom's vehicle to replace the

&gt; I recently got a promo tape from from VOA(in respose to a request for the
&gt; Jerry Garcia poster which they didn't include) and noted that the EV was not
&gt; mentioned in either the tape or the promo material. Is the EV, or something
&gt; like it, still offered? I've only seen a couple and never been in one. Is it
&gt; honestly a match or superior to the Chrysler products. Same price range?

JEEZ!  Okay, I'm calm now.  No, the EV is NOT a match to the Chrysler
prodocts (Mopar Minis).  HELL YES, it's superior!

My dad has had 3 Mopar Minis since 1984.  He loves them, too.  But, from
what I can tell, either good ol' dad isn't that big on bargaining, or the
prices for the Mopars are higher than for an &quot;equivalent&quot; (if that's
possible) EV config.  Also, I always thought that the Mopars would get
better mileage, but NO.  My dad's vans all got (new one also gets) around
19-20mpg.  I had a Previa (Jelly Bean Van) that got 23mpg at 75mph, which
ain't bad.  The EV GL with the 5-speed gets me usually 20-21, rarely 19,
and recently 23 on a couple of tanks.

The EV is rumored to be coming back in the next couple of months (in
addition to the Winnie Bagoos you can buy now), possibly with the V6
engine.

Happy hunting!
