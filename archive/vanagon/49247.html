    My wife was looking  over my shoulder when I read this post in 
r.a.vw.h20.  She laughed at me, hard, so I am passing it on to you all.

&gt;Watercooled engine used on vanagon only 1986 thru 1991.  It was run out of
&gt;oil.  The van is in good shape otherwise, but I am no mechanic.  A loca
&gt;(Chattanooga, TN) shop will install if I can find an engine.  Or I will
&gt;entertain any offer on it &quot;as is&quot;.  I love my van, bought new on the
&gt;European delivery plan and toured there and accross US.  Still only 74,000
&gt;miles, comatose in my drive.
