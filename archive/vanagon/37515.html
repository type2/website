Subject:       Saphire XI Radio problems

Hi.

I picked up a Saphire XI radio at the junkyard a couple of days ago 
for $10. It came with a metal faceplate from a type III, an air 
cooled thermostat &amp; bracket, and four bench seat mounts for my '71 
bus. The yard meister was smiling when I left, and so was I, both of 
us being certain that we had smoked the other guy.

I've run into a little problem in trying to hook the radio up.  
I've found the power lead (black w. fuse) and the speaker wires, but 
there's a thick blue wire that I can't figure.  The antenna is the 
ground, isn't it???  The radio works without the blue wire hooked up, 
but if anyone has an idea of what it might be for, I'd sure like to 
know. 

Thanks!
