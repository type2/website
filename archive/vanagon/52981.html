Subject: Re: BA 6 AUX FAN

OK a big assumption on my part....the VW Manual indicates the same functions
whether it is diesel or not. What would be the differences? The spark plug
is a glow plug so would that need to be changed?. A high compresssion
chamber? Different fuel pump?

&gt;whoa...   are you sure???   Eberspacher make diesel versions, DA6, D for
&gt;diesel, B for benzene (gas).  Do they say clearly the gas unit runs on
&gt;diesel without any mods?   Tim Smith
