Subject: Strange Bus Sighting

I was heading West on I70 from Columbus towards Dayton, OH when I got a
glimpse of a LATE model bus (?!?!?!?!?!???).  It was heading east so I
only got a quick look.  The bus was a silver colored 'Loaf with a newer
looking silver Westy roof (Like on my Vanagon).  The kicker...this Loaf
had what I believe to be a radiator in the front.  A black grill about
four foot square.  This was not a retrofit add on?  Was this one of the
Mexico/Brazillian or somewhere else bus?
