&gt; 
&gt; Most people I know who have coolers in their engine compartment have the
&gt; hot side of the cooler routed out through the floor of the engine
&gt; compartment, which takes care of that problem.


If you do that you could be robbing air from the engine cooling system. 
Other components could run hotter ;&gt;)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;If you put it under the van, it will get wiped off the first time
&gt; &gt;you go over something in the road.
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I read a lot of posts about temps. These things were made to run in the
&gt; &gt;Sahara desert! Kind'a like the SW as I remember it! :&gt;) If your
&gt; &gt;timing is set correct, cooling system is intact, and you run good oil you
&gt; &gt;sould be fine.
&gt; 
&gt; If I may add one more thing,  &quot;And if your compression is not too high&quot;.
&gt; 

Agreed! I run 6.8:1 myself. I still run 93 octain fuel.


&gt; &gt;Remember, people will sell you anything. Even if it doesn't work.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Can anyone in the group find a referance to what a *HIGH* oil temp is?
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;How to Hot Rod your VW Engine mentions 270 as &quot;appalling&quot;, if I remember
&gt; correctly.

Got my copy off the shelf.

page 89:

&quot;deplorable, but its not an uncommon condition.&quot;

&quot;275 degrees F. can be considered acceptable with a good 40 to 50 weight oil

Just some food for thought.
