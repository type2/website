Subject: Re: Engine cleaning

yep I use to clean my 1.9l wasser boxer all the time.....then I 
discovered that it accelerated the corrosion on all the senders 
giving me a huge case of agita when it 
sputtered-stalled-died-resurrected.  Now, in retrospect,  I try to 
keep a little water proof stuff {snoseal,  vasoline etc}  on all the 
senders and use my compressor to blow off all the junk on the 
engine because it doesn't get grimey dirty liquid-like at all.
