&gt;Is there an upgrade for the orig stock shift knob? Did the Wolfsburg editions
&gt;have a MoMo type knob? How does it come off? My old '77 Westy had a great

&gt;My Tristar has a MoMo knob. I really like the feel. Don't know how it comes
off. It also has wood all around the shifter boot on the floor that matches
the shift knob wood.
