&gt;   The calculations we did for the now infamous &quot;wear index&quot; indicate that with

&gt;   with a numerically higher 4 th gear, the result could be 3781 rpm at 60 mph.
&gt;   The Haynes manual for 1600 buses also talks about something called &quot;mountain 
&gt;   gears&quot; which has a numerically higher final drive.

Maybe he meant a '66 bus, because I think I turn 4k RPM at 60 MPH.  :)
And what is the stock tire size, 195-75x14?
