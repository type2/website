&gt;A friend of mine called me last night to ask me about his accelerator
&gt;cable.  Of course they never break in the driveway on a sunny day.  Last
&gt;night here in Austin it happened to be cold and drizzly.  Anyway, I
&gt;explained to him how to replace it but we have a question.  His van is a
&gt;'73 but he has a beetle engine instead of the type IV.  Should he buy a
&gt;cable for a '73 or will a cable from an earlier year work better?

i'd suggest a cable from a 71 ... i think the hookup in the front is the
same.
