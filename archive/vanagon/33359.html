Subject: Safari Conversions

Anyone familiar with the old Safari Conversions company?  I am 
considering buying a '72 with a complete Safari kit installed.  Would 
like to know more about the company as I have not seen too many of these 
kits, I am more familiar with the original Westfalias.  The Safari 
Conversions are radically different looking.

The condition of this package in the '72 is close to excellent and 
everything works!  Overall the Bus is in very good condition only slight 
surface rust and minor dings in the bumpers.  Only thing I really dislike 
about it is the '77 F.I. 2000cc and the transaxle made from '73 and '74 
parts.  Is it going to be hard to go back to an original 1700 and '72 
transaxle?

Overall, it looks like a real winner and I am 98% sure I will buy it.  It 
has been stored the past two winters and only driven in Spring and Fall.  
Well taken care of and I would be the fourth owner.
