Howdy,

	I am going to put a stock bus sunroof in my '56 kombi, and I was
wondering if anyone out there has any experience with this operation,
or something similar.  I bought the complete sunroof with the
surrounding roof section, and I plan to weld it in.  

	I was thinking about getting a lap-flanging tool from Eastwood, and
creating a lip in the existing roof, all the way around where the sunroof
would go, so the sunroof would overlap the original roof about 1/4&quot; all
the way around, but because of the recess created by the flange, both 
pieces would be flush.  Essentially, the new section would then &quot;sit in&quot; 
the flange I created.  Like so: (cross section)

   roof               sunroof                 roof

	Anybody have any better ideas?  Suggestions?  Comments?  This seems
like it would be easier to weld, since the clamps holding it down would
not have to work so hard...

	Another questiion I have, is this:  It appears that I will have
to cut through the rear roof crossmember.  Do the busses that come with
a sunroof from the factory have another cross member farther back, or 
do they do without it.  I have never seen one of these without a 
headliner, so its hard to tell. 

	Anybody in the Sacramento area wanna come give me a hand?

Thanks,
Thom
