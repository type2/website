Subject: RE: VANAGON digest 774

I recently purchased a 77 westy that had lower compression in the 3rd and
4th cylinders in the hope that it would make it to spring.  Come spring I
decided I would pull the engine and fix the &quot;problem&quot;.  Well it didn't make
it to spring.  It continued to run slower and slower until it topped out around
30 mph.  I have since taken it off the road and retired it to its work space.
Besides the fact that it runs slow it seems to run and idle fine.  It even
starts right up and gives off no unusual noises.  I am prepared to buy new
piston rings and cylinders if needed but my question has to do with cracking
the crank case to do &quot;rod&quot; work.  How do I know if this is needed (there are
no unusual noises).  Where do you recommend buying the replacement parts I
would need for my 77 fuel injected california westy 2 liter?  Thanks for
your help, I miss my bus and can't wait to get back behind the wheel.  
My message isn't really suppose to be a reply, I'm just new to this.

Is it possible to tell from the info I gave you what kind of rebuild it
needs (pistons, rings, cylinders, valve work).  It has about 107K miles on it.
