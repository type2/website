&gt; Hello Vanagon list, I would like to install a deep cycle aux. Battery

&gt;store wants $45 for a battery cut-out relay. Anyone know a cheaper
&gt;alternative? Could you not use, say a 1970's Ford starter relay? (Cost $6).

It will last a couple of hours, then burn out.  Replacing it every couple
of hours, it's not such a bargain.  :)

Camping World sells the correct part for about 12 bucks.  Looks similar to
the Ford starter relay, but is continuous-duty wheras the Ford one isn't.
