OK, thanks John, for the hint, I was thinking I could do it that way, but
since I now have my front wheel bearings, the whole front end will come apart
anyway.

Re: Bilsteins.  I spoke with Bilstein West coast, and was given a number,
B46-1911, for the front, B46-1912 for the back.  NOW DON&quot;T GET ALL EXCITED
JUST YET.  I spoke with Bilstein East coast, and they wern't sure if the
number was correct.  Everyone I have spoken with, aftermarket shop, Bilstein
experts - several, etc. has not actually ordered a set of Bilsteins. 
So........

I told the Bilstein East coast guy (supposed to be a pretty good guy for VW's)
that I would measure my front shocks for him.  He will in turn check the
measurements against the B46-1911, and/or cross to something that is close. 
If anyone has a virgin or trashed set of OEM Boge's you could help the effort
by measuring yours and forwarding the info to me.  I am bound and determined
to nail this down and end up with a set of Bilsteins on the front of my Syncro
Beast.

Here's what we need.

o  Diameter of the shock body
o  Compressed Length, center of lower mount to below the thread.
o  Extended Length, ditto above.
o  Shaft diameter.  (Thread, if you know it.)
o  Spring perch height from center of the mount hole.
o  Inside diam. and outside diam. of the spring.
I think that about coveres it.

Mine is coming apart starting tonight.

Since the Vanagon is still made in South Africa, I am assuming that Bilstein
has a market there, and they might make a shock.  If they don't, it was
heartening to have the Bilstein rep tell me that if I could measure mine up,
he'd cross it to the closest equivalent shock.
