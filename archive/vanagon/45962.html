Subject: '72 Vanagon Engine Room

 I heard some one say the '72 was most difficult year to work on
but shined it on. I've been working on a '73 and assumed they looked
the same. As Bill Clinton would say, &quot;I've been tricked&quot;.
 
 I bought this '72 and drug it home months ago. I had to build a shop
and sundry other forms of drudgery before I could start putting an 
engine in. I hadn't even unloaded the extra goodies and boxes of broken
engine one always gets.
 
 So today I unloaded. Where is my hatch on top? Who designed this piece of
crap? 
 
 This is not going to work. I will have to get a hatch and frame from
some poor donor and mortise it in there. 
 Has anyone done this? Got a proven plan? 
 Talk to me guys even if it's just an idea. 
 
 Thanks in advance etc.     west
