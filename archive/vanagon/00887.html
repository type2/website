	Dave's right, and it doesn't stop at smog.  If the said boys in blue
catch you speeding or whatnot, you can look forward to a 170% &quot;Penalty
Assesment&quot;  which translates thus: a $35 ticket turns into a $95 ticket.
And you can also look forward to an assembly line traffic court process,
where you get about .03 seconds to explain before &quot;guilty, $$$$$ go to
the door on the right...  Next!&quot;  Lets see, there's also the Department
of Motor Vehicles, which has the collective brainpower of a small, 
retarded gnat.  

	The only reason I stay in California is the surfing (try Steamer Lane
in Santa Cruz in January, at high tide! )
