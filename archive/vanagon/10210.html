Subject: RE: Brazilian Bus: The Plan

Drive the junker to Brazil and leave it there when you switch VINs to the
Brazilbus.  Take counterfeit $20's to Mexico and bring a spare tire full of
cocaine back to finance the trip.  If you store it carefully the Brazilbus
will be worth even more when you get out of jail.
