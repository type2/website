Subject: Gas spill on filling Vanagon

Every time I fill the tank on my '84 westy about a half of a cup of gas 
pours down the side of the van when the gas pump automatically shuts 
off.  In Washington we have those vapor recovery type gas pumps.  Is 
there anything I can do about this overflow.  

On  related note, I was filling my wife's Honda (sorry) and I stuck the 
nozzle in the car and used the little lock to hold the pump on and then 
let go.  The pump popped right out of the car and stayed on, pouring 
a couple of gallons of gasoline in my eyes, on my face and clothes.  Be 
careful with those gas pumps.  

P.S. no lasting damage from the gas soaking except a healthy respect for 
gas pumps that I should have had anyway.  

John Brown
