&gt;Hi all,
&gt;     It's finally done-my Inuvik pages have arrived! 8.6 megs of gif
&gt;files, 77 photos in all, and all available at my website. It's not
&gt;complete yet, I want to add a pretty front end, but since it's taken 9
&gt;months to get this far I'm just posting the puppy-I'll gussie up the
&gt;front end later... For those newbies among us, check out
&gt;&lt;http://www.chaco_dot_com/inuvik/&gt; for the original trials and tribulations
&gt;of, as Unca Joel puts it, &quot;the Inuvik Idiots&quot; (I resmeble that
&gt;remark...). And, for those ready to see my side of the trip, the URL is
&gt;in my .sig, come on over and check it out.

Hi all,
     Got the image map added over the weekend, gives the Inuvik trip a 
much nicer interface, come on over and check it out...

Peace,
