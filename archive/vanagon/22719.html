&gt;      Kevin asks,
&gt;      
&gt;      &gt;Item 3: My bus is a converted 6 volt `66. That is, the lights, gen, 
&gt;      &gt;bat, and the basic assorted stuff is, but the wiper motor and the 
&gt;      &gt;infamous vdo clock are still 6 volt. I plan to snag the 12v wiper 
&gt;      &gt;assembly out of my parts 67, but am wondering what to do for the 
&gt;      &gt;clock? Are the step-down units available for wiper motors sensitive 
&gt;      &gt;enough for the clock?
&gt;      
1.  A long time ago I tried to use the wiper motor out of a '67 in my '65, which
I converted to 12V, and ran into some problems getting it to fit right. Problem 
is, I don't remember why. Sorry! (But at least if you have problems, you know 
you weren't the only one...)

2. The 6V clock is happy (and just as accurate) on 12V. The reason is that the 
early clocks have a solenoid that &quot;kicks&quot; every minute or so to wind a little 
spring. So all you need is a voltage to kick the solenoid once in a while, and 
mine has been running for over 5 years on 12V. The accuracy( or lack thereof) is
dependent on the clock mechanism itself, which is adjustable on the back of the 
clock.
