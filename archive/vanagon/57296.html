&gt; Go to the Tirerack and check out the Borbet Replica II wheels:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.tirerack_dot_com/wheels/borbet/bo_rep2.htm
&gt; 
&gt; These &quot;Mercedes only&quot; wheels are supposed to be a direct match for the Westy.
&gt; 

Of course the Borbet Type C is also another nice choice and does not 
look like a damn Merc wheel.  As to proper applicability we've been 
there already, look at the damn archives people.
