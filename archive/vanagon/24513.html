Subject: Long Week for Rusty?

Rusty &quot;The Vortex&quot; VanBondo sez (In plain English): 

I can tell that this is gonna be a long week! Between Eric Oster &quot;crediting&quot;
me with the speculative &quot;What does Bob look like?&quot; thread and Ol' Unca Joel
and Brother Ric Golen &quot;crediting&quot; me with a &quot;plethora of responses&quot;
regarding the language that we all use- I can just see that it might end up
being a doozey!

Firstly, Someday I am going to be at a swapmeet or &quot;Bug-o-Mania&quot; or
something and have someone walk right up to me (in my face) and say, &quot;So YOU
are VanBondo! Well I'm Hoover and THIS is for causing me all this grief!&quot;
POW! ;)
No, really I think this thread ought to be deemed either a dead topic or
Eric's idea. I will puss out on this one. Nice concept though Eric! =)
Peace, Bob.

Secondly, Speak what you will and how you decide. Be who you be and tell it
like it is. We all know that I can't even keep my syntax straight or spell
half way korectlee. It's not like I'm close to being the Den Mother of the
list. &quot;Mother&quot; maybe, but that's another story for another list. I can't
imagine where Puerto Rico is on the UPS shipping rate list especially for
complete 2.0 long blocks to Arizona. Isn't it near the Lower East Side? ;)

Now, if I could only get Marty Gaylean to contact me before he moves down to
Phoenix...
