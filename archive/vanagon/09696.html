&gt; So DerekDrew_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; &gt; My front mats in my Vanagon, the two mats that go on either side under the
&gt; &gt; driver and front passenger's seats, are worn. I remember that I bought them
&gt; &gt; at the dealer. Does anybody have a line on the best place to go to buy new
&gt; &gt; ones? Mine have nice little VW logos on them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well I still see mats at the dealer and occasionally look them over.
Dr. Intel :) asks:
&gt; some kind of material that will
&gt; protect the carpet.  I'd like to get something down before it gets
&gt; too worn.
I use the awful stuff your Aunt has in her home to protect carpet 
walk-ways, you know, that clear patterned vinyl stuff that comes in 
huge rolls at the fleet stores.  Actually, it installs very well with 
minor trimming and is not obtrusive.  At the rear edge, unscrew the 
OEM trim strip and place the back edge of the vinyl under that.  Then 
trim the parking brake area and up by the shifter.
