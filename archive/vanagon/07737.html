as the other person had stated, the bentley manual that is currently being
replaced is for 63'-67. From time to time you find workshop manuals at swap
meets for the older busses. If you want you can call my friend Craig Allen
who has a photocopied version of a late 50's manual. He is located in
Toronto, Canada and his phone number is (416) 724-1599 and i beleive he is
asking $50..

&gt;&gt; This is my first post, Yay!, and I just have a couple of quick questions.
&gt;&gt; I have a '59 Kombi and it's my first bus. So far I've only seen
&gt;&gt; references to Bentley manuals for '63 to '67. I've got the idiot book
&gt;&gt; already (I use it a LOT too :-) but I like the bentley manuals for
&gt;&gt; some of the specific stuff. Is this manual valid for my model, except
&gt;&gt; for maybe the bullet turn signals?
&gt;
&gt;Well, they just started reprinting the manual for the late split window
&gt;busses.  So I doubt that you'd find one for yours.  There are a few
&gt;differences, like you probably have a reserve gas switch, not a gas
&gt;gauge.  I'm sure there are also other differences, but I don't know
&gt;them.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, I am replacing the engine in the bus. It had a '57 1200 sitting
&gt;&gt; in the back seat when I got it(and it still turns even) but I decided I
&gt;&gt; might want to get on a highway someday so anyway, what's the story on
&gt;&gt; the flywheels, I seem to remember this coming up before, but I may have
&gt;&gt; missed a crucial part, Are the 12 and 6 volt flywheels the same size? I
&gt;&gt; know that the teeth are different, ergo if you have a 12 volt flywheel,
&gt;&gt; you have a 12 volt starter to fit it, but are the diameters the same, or
&gt;&gt; will a 12 volt flywheel machine my transmission for me?
&gt;
&gt;The teeth are different, and so is the size.  You need to make room in
&gt;the bell of the tranny for the 12V flywheel.  I would suggest machining
&gt;it out yourself, and not relying on the flywheel to do it. :)
