Subject: Re: Do I have the wrong pressure plate?

The problems you are describing are PRECISELY what I have been agonizing
and hassling over for a year.  This is my story, combined with yours.

&gt;My clutch goes out (something snaps, foot goes to the floor, acomplishing 
&gt;nothing) so I pull the engine. The tip on one of the forks that holds the 
&gt;throwout bearing is bent back and worn to the point that the bearing has 
&gt;fallen off the fork and exploded into several pieces. 

Exactly what happened the first time I &quot;fixed&quot; my clutch, only I didn't
notice the bent fork until the second time I &quot;fixed&quot; the clutch.

&gt;About a week later, clutch goes out again, same as above with grinding 
&gt;noise. Pull the engine again. This time, the throwout bearing has again 
&gt;exploded, but the forks look fine. 

Exactly.  I had replaced everything.  New disk, t-o bearing, new pressure
plate, and I bent the fork back into place.  So far I have gone through two
t-o bearings.  They were the correct type of t-o bearing, the kind with the
two small cylindrical pivot shafts 180 degrees apart that fit onto the
hooks of the fork. 

 I bought a pressure plate of the diaphram variety with a collar where the
t-o bearing pushes against.  According to a &quot;Hot VWs&quot; article (Pressure
Plate and Throwout Bearing Interchangeability, by Dean Kirsten, March 1995)
this is the correct set up.

There are two varieties of t-o bearings to use on the early buses.  First
there is the early F&amp;S style that you and I use, then there is the late
Sachs style.
These t-o bearings are compatible with certain cross shafts.

Early Cross-shaft (fork)  VW part number suffix #701C  (1961-1970)

Late Cross-shaft (fork)  VW part number suffix #701E (1971- Oct.1972)

Very Late Cross-shaft (fork) VW part number suffix #701F (Nov.1972 - on)

I think that the #701F fork was only used in the Beetle, so I won't talk
anymore about it.

The #701C fork goes with the early style t-o bearing.

The #701E fork goes with the late style t-o bearing.  You can tell if you
need the late style t-o bearing and fork because of the steel guide tube
that bolts to the transaxle housing, around the input shaft, and the t-o
bearing goes over it.

There are two general types of pressure plates.  There is the type with 3
big fingers (early) and the type with 18 fingers (diaphram plate - late).
Both of these plates can come with or without a collar.  The collar is a
round metal disk that joins all of the ends of the fingers (3 or 18 of
them) and provides a surface against which the t-o bearing pushes.  It is
there to evenly distribute the pressure from the t-o bearing.

If your pressure plate HAS a collar over the fingers, you must use the
early style t-o bearing.  For 1961-1970 transaxles, this is our only
choice.

However, if you have a later transaxle (1971 - Oct.1972), the kind with the
#701E cross-shaft and guide tube, you must use the late style t-o bearing
and pressure plate WITHOUT a collar.

So much for compatibility, but what about the recurring problem?  I'm still
stuck!
I have matched all of the correct parts and I still get EXPLODING t-o bearings.
I think it is the fork.

&gt;Finally get it back, pull the engine. The bearing has ONCE AGAIN 
&gt;exploded, and the fork looks pretty tweaked. The left fork is bent 
&gt;laterally a bit towards the drivers side. The tip of the right fork 
&gt;(where the bearing seats) is very worn and looks like it's about to break 
&gt;off. 

Yup.  Only mine is bent toward the passenger side.  Maybe my fork needs to
be replaced rather than bent back into shape.  Most people, with no
experience with this problem will suggest this solution to us.  But the
problem may be a more insidious one than that.  What's causing the fork to
bend in the first place?

&gt;
&gt;WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?


&gt;(mid to late 60's) incompatible? And most of all, is this damn bus worth 
&gt;ruining my marriage over?

Don't ruin your marriage!  But try to stick with it, maybe together we can
beat this problem, and keep our marriages and our buses!
