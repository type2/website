Subject: For lack of a cotter pin...

This happened to me a few months ago &amp; is probably worth sharing:
	I was cruising along in my 71 Westy without a care in the world 
except for the usual listening to the engine for any new weird sounds and 
glancing at my idiot lights every few seconds just to be sure---when I 
began braking to turn down a side street.  In the middle of the turn
my brake pedal went straight to the floor.  Fortunately there was plenty of 
open road to coast to a stop and eventually apply my emergency brake (very 
surprised at my slow reaction time).  
	The culprit turned out to be the cotter pin that holds the clevis 
pin in the connecting rod running from the brake pedal assembly to the master 
cylinder.   I don't know if it just fell out or if I was driving without 
one for some time but it's something I've never checked or thought about 
before.  Maybe a previous owner adjusting the connecting rod or replacing 
the master cylinder was a little careless.  I recovered the clevis pin 
which still dangled from the very edge of the connecting rod, inserted a 
new cotter pin and went on my way.  Such a tiny part could cause huge 
problems!
