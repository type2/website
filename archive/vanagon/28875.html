Subject: 80-85 Westy - which years are best?

I'm in the market for a Westfalia for $8-10K CDN, which around here 
means 1980 - 85 models. As this will be my first van (I've had many 
different Rabbits, Jettas, etc.), I'm not too sure what to look for &amp; 
what to avoid. Any help here would be appreciated. So far, these 
questions have come up:

1. Is it true that the W/C models are better than the A/C, or is this 
just due to more power? It seems there is a few problems with the W/C 
design?

2. I've done a turbo diesel swap in a diesel Jetta - is this feasible 
in a Van (either from gas or diesel w/c engine)
