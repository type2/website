&gt; 
&gt; Most Vanagon manuals incorrectly state the final drive ratio for the syncro
&gt; transmission. The manuals state that the final drive ratio is 5.43 in the
&gt; rear and 4.86 for the front final drive. This is, of course, impossible as
&gt; they have to be the same. The actual ratio for the rear is 4.86.

Dammit!  Every time someone mentions a Syncro, I have smack my head on
something.  I REALLY wished I'd gotten one.  I think they're appreciating
in value.  And would be really nice on those rougher trails.  :(

Just bitchin' and moanin'
