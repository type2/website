Subject: Smell from heater

Hi y'all

I am new to the list and have been waiting to see some discussion
about the smell that comes from the heaters of the watercooled
Vanagons.  It was my understanding that this was a common
feature, or is there a way to correct this problem?

What would happen if I slightly overfilled my oil?
Would I expect to get oil mixed with the fuel?

What spare parts should I bring on a 880 mile
trip?  (84 Vanagon)

I just purchased my brick with a rebuilt engine, what are
the symptons indicating that the rebuild was not 100%
effective?

How much would you have paid for an 84 Vanagon GL
with 115K miles, 5K on rebuilt engine, manual trans,
no air, body with little rust, seats in good shape, carpeting
fair?

Thanks for your help,

Jim 
84 Vanagon
