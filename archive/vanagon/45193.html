&gt;  Does anyone know what years VW made steerings locks for
&gt; vans? I've got a '62 bus and would like a lock for it.
&gt; Are they hard to come by?, Was it just steering locks or
&gt; gearshift locks as well? How much are these?

I bought one from Vintage Parts about 8 years ago.  It worked great!  It 
cost several hundred dollars as I bought it with a new steering assembly 
for a 64 Kombi.
