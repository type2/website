Subject: EV Fog light switch for sale...


Now that I've done wiring the fogs, I think I'm going to abandon my other 
project - mounting a pair of Hella 2000 Rallye driving lights on the EV. I 
think I'll just put in a pair of those 90/100w headlight bulbs in 
instead....

Anywho....I now have a spare fog(driving) light switch. The first $10 takes 
it. If interested, e-mail me.
