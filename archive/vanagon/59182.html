Subject: transmission whoes

I finally got all my paperwork done. the bank loaned me a whopping 8k to
buy my 89 westie. I put down 1100.00 and just ordered a set of yokohama
y370s (~$385.00 mounted and stems and tax) from sears. needless to say I
am out of toy spending money.!! The dealer I bought the van from just
spend ~$300.00 on a new clutch master and slave cylinder for the
transmission and a new thermostat housing and coolant change on the
vehicle.. the kids are  whinning (when are we going to see grandma in
the new van) and now the coupe de grace..transmission is grinding from
2nd to 3rd the mech says its a synch gear..cost to fix ~$1200.00
(picture of crash and burn) from searching the archives and reading
horror stories on &quot;hiccups&quot; and motor overheating and head jobs and the
fact that special tools are neede to do this work aaannndd my local vw
dealer says his mech has never done this before,is causing serious
friction with my murphies law wife (also known as &quot;you got took&quot;
yvonne)I have done all the paperwork gotten the money, but have not
taken delivery because the dealer is willing to work with me on the cost
of repair...should I just save my money and get an Aerostar?

desperate
89 westie hopeful
