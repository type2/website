So Jim Ellis says:
&gt; 
&gt; Whatsup with the Vintagvw listserv? I haven't recieved anything for at least
&gt; 3 days. Usually I'm flooded. Was I a bad boy or what? Maybe I need a little
&gt; discipline. OOOh! (oops wrong list for that talk). Whip me, beat me, make me
&gt; change my spark plugs! ;)

I haven't seen anything today either.  John must be having server problems
again. :(
