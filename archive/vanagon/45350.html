Subject: Stupid Hubcap question for '74 Westy
Date: Wed, 26 Jun 1996 18:53:00 -0500

With all of the discussion on tires and wheels lately on the list, that
brings me to  a question concerning hubcaps.  How do you put them on
without putting a big dent in them. (as I have four new ones on the way).
I have tried doing by hand, and end up slinging some off.  I have tried
using a rubber hammer, and denting them.  New ones should be here
tomorrow...and I don't want to dent them or lose them.

Any Suggestions from experience?
