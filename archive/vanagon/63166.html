&gt; Can anyone tell me what the little round test plug with a rubber cap

&gt; service advisor about it when I was there last week and he didn't have
&gt; a
&gt; clue.

   If it is the same as mine you will see that the wire goes to a sensor
to detect timing off or the flywheel. Probably used for computerized
diagnostics.
