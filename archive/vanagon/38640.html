Subject: Cost per mile



To All:

What does it cost to get from here to there?  More than you think.

&gt;From a sub-compact's 43.8 cents per mile to the 62.7 cents needed to keep a
full-sized sedan on the road, the cost of personal transportation in America
is following an ever-rising curve.

Starting back in 1950, the American Automobile Association (AAA) has
conducted an annual driving-cost survey.  The costs are based on AVERAGE cost
of gasoline, oil, mantenance and tires, plus fixed costs for insurance,
license &amp; registration, taxes, finance charges and remaining value after the
end of four years and forty thousand miles.

Needless to say, the numbers are hopelessly optomistic when compared to the
realities of owning a car in California, where the typical driver averages
more than 12,000 miles per year.   Taxes, smog checks, registration and
insurance are also higher than the figures used by the AAA, giving a more
realistic 54.6 cents per mile for a subcompact and 77.1 for a full sized
sedan in California.

To figure out what your actual costs are, write to the American Automobile
Association at PO Box 75, 1000 AAA Drive, Heathrow, Florida 32746-5063 and
ask for a free copy of &quot;Your Driving Costs&quot;.  You'll have to include a
stamped, self-addressed letter-sized envelope.  If you're a member of the
auto club,  check with them first.  They may have the figures already
adjusted for your state and locale.

As a point of interest, my 1965 bus costs about eleven cents per mile per
year, based on 12,000 miles traveled.  The cost break down is shown below.

   Fuel                          720.00
   Engine overhaul fund   180.00
   Insurance                   106.00
   Tire replacement fund    72.00
   Misc. maintenance*      60.00
   Oil, filters &amp; lubrication  30.00

*Miscellaneous maintenance includes headlights, lamps, wiper blades, cleaning
supplies and so forth.

 Since I do my own maintenance, each month I put some money aside for tires
and engine overhaul.  Brakes and suspension parts are included in the tire
fund.  Actually, the funds are mixed and budgeted at about $25 per month.
 Since a properly built engine lasts ten years or more, despite the several
brake jobs, valve jobs and new clutches along the way, there's always a tidy
sum on hand.
