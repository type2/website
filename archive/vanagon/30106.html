Subject: Greetings / gas heater info

Greetings Folks,
I've been corresponding with many of you from the sidelines of this group, 
but now I've decided to join for real.  Hello.  

This has already been posted here, but I thought I would do it again 
personally.  I have lots of used parts for gas heaters.  Currenty, I do not 
have any complete bus units.  I try to keep the prices of my wares low.  
Also, although I'm occasionally stumped, I'm pretty good at trouble 
shooting the darn things.  Especially The Eberspachers.

Currently, I have two Westies, a '66 and a '67, and a '63 bug.  I just
picked up the '67 as a parts bus for my '66, but it is in really nice
shape.  Although this van has a personality, it is new to my family and I
have no emotional attachment to it yet.  Should I be heartless and cruel
and part it to death?  Or fix it, sell it, and hope for a parts bus beyond
repair? 

Tom
