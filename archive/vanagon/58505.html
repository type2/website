Subject: Yet another Tire Recommendation for VW Buses

&gt;| Worth checking on Goodyears too BTW, the Wrangler AT
&gt;| 6ply in 195/75 looks like an excellent snow tire, best treads I've seen in
&gt;| that size.

	These are very nice tires in snow, rain, and even dry conditions
(maybe a little noisy for some, but my van is so much quieter than my old
breadloaf that I would probably consider tractor tire tread to be quiet ;) ).
Though they keep changing the tread pattern from what I can tell (every car
I have seen has a different tread pattern on their ATs. When I bought my
van, it had different tread patterns front and rear, though both tires were
Goodyear Wrangler ATs - though the rears where M+S tires)...

&gt;| the door sticker on my SYncro lists 185R, and 205/70 as 'stock' sizes on the
&gt;| 14&quot; steel rims. 195/75 fits nicely in between. 

	Supposedly, the 195/75s should be about 1/4&quot; taller, but I suppose
they are going to deform more when weighted due to the narrowing width which
will translate to a longer contact patch which means the tire has to squash
more... I found my spare (I think it is the original - a 205/70) was a bit
taller than the tires on my van, but the spare was not weighted and the tire
I was comparing it to was...
