You said:

&gt;   There's also a pretty good blues festival that happens just blocks
&gt;   away
&gt;   over Labor Day weekend. Music outdoors is hard to beat...

Before anyone shows up on the Riverfront looking for busses, I should
point out that the gathering is actually near O'Fallon, Missouri,
approximately 30 miles west of downtown St.Louis.
