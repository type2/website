&gt; &gt; The only thing that I see that I would take issue with is that the apark
&gt; &gt; plugs should be replaced at every 3000 mi tune-up.  I have always checked
&gt; &gt; and cleaned at 3000, replaced at 6000.  I always run Bosch plugs,
&gt; &gt; sometimes platinum and sometimes copper-core.  I let platinums run about
&gt; &gt; 12000 miles.  I also do not replace condenser, rotor and cap at every
&gt; &gt; tune-up.  I typically check and clean at 3000 and 6000, replacing them in
&gt; &gt; the 9000 to 12000 range, unless I am having some sort of trouble.

I wholeheartedly agree with this.  In fact, I never replace my plugs
unless there is a problem.  The fewer times you remove steel objects
from aluminum threads the better, IMO.  

BTW, DaBoat with it's rebuilt 2-liter, hydraulic lifters, and Bosch
platinum plugs flew through the California smog check this morning.  I
don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but HC was around 50 ppm 
and CO was around 3.5%.  Needless to say, I'm pleased.  The engine has a
little over 400 miles on it now, and is running great (knock on wood).
