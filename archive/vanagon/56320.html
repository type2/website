Subject: '82 diesel, Ring job



        Well, I spent today takeing apart (in frame) the engine of my '82
vanagon.  About six months ago I had replaced the head gasket and the oil
consumption jumped from about 500mi to the quart to 200mi/quart.  Then about
a month ago it suddenly jumped to apx 25mi/quart and when I ran up the
engine speed, the oil backed up the filler tube and out the oil level check
hole.

        So, I decided that it is time for new rings.  Today I got the head
off and a piston out, it dosent use the stretch bolts on the rod caps so the
will save me a couple of dollars.  

        This is my curent shopping list for tuesday when I go to the FLAP.
Can anyone think of anything that I should add to the list?

Head bolts (these are the stretch type)
Head gasket (2 hole)
Valve cover gasket
Oil pan gasket
        (I will check the price of a complete gasket set)
Ring set (I will take in a piston to check on the size)
Rod bearing set (I will take them too, so as to check the size)
Timing belt (I replaced the idler pulley apx. six months ago)

        Is it likely that I will need valve stem seals?  Has anyone had
trouble with these?  Should I consider having the head done at a machine
shop?  (Bently seems to imply that I should leave the head alone)
