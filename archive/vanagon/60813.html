Subject: Looking for a van.

        Greetings all. I have a friend who has managed to finally save
enough cash to consider buying a van. He's not looking for anything to
spiffy or nice, but he would at least like it to run. Note: Van must be in
Alberta, or BC!
        He's hoping to find:
- '70 - 80' VW Westie
- running condition, but willing to work a bit to get er going (he better
get used to it anyhow)
- interior doesnt matter, he plans to fix it up himself anyhow over the years
- not toooo much rust

        Other than that he's willing to take anything, as long as its under
$3000 (Can.). If you can help me help this guy it would be much appreciated.

ciao kids,
