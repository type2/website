&gt; &gt; I've seen far too many accidents in N.E. P.A. from the little corn
&gt; &gt; munchers to care how many get killed during hunting season.  By the way,
&gt; &gt; it was all of the development in this country that forced the deer into
&gt; &gt; tighter home ranges which in turn caused them to over-populate.  Keep
&gt; &gt; killin them.(P.S. this is not meant to be a flame,but I have had with all

&gt; Boy, that's a great attitude.  I'm not an animal-rights person, but if
&gt; the people hadn't developed too extensively in the first place then deer
&gt; wouldn't be out wandering the highways.  If we take away their homes
&gt; they've gotta go somewhere.  I just figure it's the &quot;deer's revenge&quot; and
&gt; that's what we get for destroying their homes.  Running into a deer on
&gt; the highway is absolutely not a good thing at all, but it's only going
&gt; to get worse with time.  
&gt; 
&gt; PS - this is not meant to be a flame, but I have had it with all
&gt; ignorant people.

Here we go.  I see I have started something here.  I really should stop
this and stick with vanagon content.  But,  Deer don't know squat.  They
just eat and have sex, and eat and have sex, and then they wonder over to
the highway and oops, your wife and kid are dead and your life is ruined
because of a tick infested, carbon based food source.  Not one deer is
worth the price of someone's life.  Kill'em all.
