Subject: Spare Parts Salvage Yard... Sort of

Greetings Brethren,

Well I'm home with my little red treasure. No Name yet, but I did save it
from the wreaking yard.  The yard buys late model vanagons and all other
VWs exclusivily and either sells the wreaks for rebuilding, rebuilds them
there or ships them by boat somewhere it appears or finally they simply
strip them to the bones and store the parts under cover.  The operation is
about a 7 0r 8 on the auto recyclers I've seen.  His inventory is
computerized, but he is not on the internet. Happy hunting!

  I did some checking on the list of parts request I was emailed.  He does
keep three or four pre 88 vanagons on the grounds for canabalizing.

The name is the BUGGY Doctor, Miami, Florida. 305-636-2717

Has: 83' RHS mirror and LHS parking/turn signal lamp, several bumper caps.

Since the other late model vans were all shipped or crushed by my arrival
time no vehicles were actually there to look at.  The gentlemans name is
Guierrmo, aka &quot;William&quot;.
