Subject: Vanagon table (front)

I haven't ever had a front table for the '83. We just move the rear one fwd.
Way too high but you don't have to bend over to eat the food. =) Hey, who
needs utencils anyway! In addition to BOWMANR%em.EDW_at_mhs.elan.af_dot_mil
(Mr.Roger Bowman) I would eventually like to have one but won't loose sleep
ovet it. good Idea about the stove top. I would wait to find a westy that's
trashed and scavange the stove top or something else.
