   What are your plans for this bus? If you are going to sell any parts off
   of it, I'm in need of the little fold up table and shelf unit that is
   attached to the fridge cabinet, if it hasn't been devoured by the
   sliding door already. Did either of these buses come with a westy tent??
   Coveting minds want to know....

Get in line! I want to find a spare folding table for my '76!!!
