Subject: Re: Smells like Gas

Paul,
I'd suspect the weird incline as a contributing factor.  I'd bet that you 
parked it pointing up (?), rather than down.  If the 79 is similar to the 
81, there are 3 ports at the front top of the tank, 2 for the 
overflow/charcoal filter and 1 for the overflow pipe.  One of these is 
either not seated or is corroded and leaking.  On the 81, a trough runs 
the length of the top of the tank to provide a passage for the heater 
pipe from the engine.  Dirt and debris can collect in this trough and 
provide a place for gasoline and water to collect and then outgas into 
and around the pipe.  Warm air from the engine then carries the fumes 
into the passenger compartment.

The tank on my 81 had corroded in this trough to such a point that the 
only time the smell would evidence itself was when the tank was filled.  
Once enough gas was used and the level in the tank dropped, the problem 
went away, which made the problem a real mystery (like yours).  It took 
pulling the tank several times to realize that the accumulated dirt 
wasn't really part of the top of the tank (which gives you an idea of how 
much dirt had collected there over time).  I wrote an article for the 
list a while ago on pulling the tank based on this experience.  I would 
venture to guess that I've probably got more experience than most in this 
arena (not that I really feel like advertising that fact ;)  ).  I 
finally located a good used tank and I've had no problems since then.  
But I had plenty of opportunity to inspect all the seals, pipes, etc. at 
that time to ensure that they were intact and not dried out.

If you can reach through the wheel well and feel around the ports for 
broken seals and moisture, you won't have to go to the trouble of 
pulling the tank.  I also don't know where the charcoal cannister resides 
on the 79 so I can't help you there.  It's more than likely seepage from 
the top of the tank though, and I'd recommend taking a few hours on the 
weekend to pull it.  Gasoline fumes are deadly in high concentrations, at 
the least they will cause nausea (like you needed me to tell you that :( ).

I'll go grab my Bentley and see if the 79 is covered.  I may be able to 
offer a more educated guess if I can see how things tie together.  I'll 
respond again if I find things are significantly different than what I 
describe (if I find anything at all).

&gt; The interior of my 79 smells like gasoline fumes.  It is a daily driver,
&gt; and I noticed it about 3 days ago.  It only smells like gasoline on the 
&gt; inside of the van, not in the engine compartment.  While driving, the smell
&gt; is more obvious.  I did a pretty good inspection of the engine compartment
&gt; and the fuel pump.  No leaks turned up!!!1
&gt; The only things that I've done different to the car in the last week are
&gt; park it on a weird incline which it is not used to, and also drive on 
&gt; the highway at a constant 60mph.  Before this I would drive a 
&gt; constant 55mph.
&gt; The car did this once after I added fuel injector cleaner awhile back, 
&gt; but when I refilled the tank, the odor left.  I refilled the tank 
&gt; this afternoon , and drove for awhile.  same smell.  i parked and opened all
&gt; the windows and let sit for 3 hrs.  Came back and same gasoline odor
&gt; with no visible leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas/suggestions
&gt; This is weird and kind of scary.
&gt;
