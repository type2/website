Subject: new e-mail address

Hi all, 

I've moved SP.
My new mail address is 
sarah_at_sprynet.co_dot_uk
The CompuServe account will remain active for my homepage, 
and I'll check the mail occasionally.

The brake job has come to a bit of a grinding halt due to the 
weather &amp; college work, but I'll be tackling a distinctly 
uncooperative wheel bearing this week... Hopefully that'll be 
the last of the irritating little problems &amp; I can get back on the 
road in time for the start of the show season.

Thanks!

Sarah
