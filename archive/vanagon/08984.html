&gt; 
&gt; It's time to start repairing and replacing and I'm stumped on how
&gt; to remove the fresh water pump from the water tank. How do the water
&gt; tubing clamps release? Is there a special tool or do you tear it off
&gt; and replace it? How about the electrical connections to the pump?

ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS!  Wow! whatever happened to push/pull
/push/pull/push/pull/oh the hell with it, lemme dump some water
from the jerry can?  ;-&gt;
