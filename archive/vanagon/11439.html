&gt; many VW's are on their 2nd/3rd carbs and many
&gt; of theses replacements are &quot;Hecho in Mexico/Brazil&quot;.  I had a bad scare
&gt; with one of these when the tube that the gas line attaches to on the carb
&gt; came out of the carb casting and sprayed gas all over the engine.  No fire
&gt; but quite scary
FWIW -- This happened to my Solex 34PICT-3. I rebuilt it so many
times and married parts from others I got at swap meets that I 
finally gave up and bought a new BOCAR (Hecho en Brasil), which
I was a little leery of, but it has not given me a bit of trouble
over the past 3 years. Of course, YMMV [groan]
