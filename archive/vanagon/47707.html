Subject: RE: More 83.5 Vanagon Cooling

&gt;&gt;Coolant expansion after shutdown should be
&gt;&gt;minimal and the second resevoir should handle it.

Does this mean I should replace the first resevoir if coolant is escaping out 
the top cap and around the sensor or is this due to another problem?

Thanks,
Bryan
