&gt;OK, since a picture is worth a thousand words, how about some good theories on
&gt;the distribution of models by year and design.  For example, if we make a lot
&gt;of
&gt;assumptions, can we conclude that the early vanagons were not popular with the
&gt;old bus enthusiasts since there seem to be very few represented in our sample?
&gt;Is is possible that the dirth of '83 vanagons is due to the problems with the
&gt;first of the wasserboxers?  Are there model years to avoid buying based on our
&gt;survivorship curve?  Is the paucity of 1988+ vans on the list due to price or a
&gt;drop in popularity?  Hope I stir things up a bit ;}

:) i've finally decided that there isn't enough data to determine anything.
you have to remember that in order to show up in the stats, the bus must be
owned by someone who (1) has internet access of some sort, and (2) has found
out about the list, and (3) has signed up to the list.  now there are lots of
folks who have buses. but fewer of them meet (1). and even fewer have met (3)
... cause some folks get on the list, then decide it's too much whatever and
get off.

so i just gave up trying to figure why so few 88's or 79's. i couldn't come
up with any valid reason. and why so many 87's??? i can understand the 71's
... cause that is a Preferred Year for the bread-loafs (beetle engine but
disk brakes). but the rest is just pure speculation of the worst academic
kind. ;)
