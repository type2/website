Subject: FS: 74 bus (update)

My e-mail has been jacked-up so if you are interested in my bus
please call 316-231-4866. The bus will also include a BA4 heater
from a type4 (Thanks to Jon Christensen). It's not all there but
it is a start. IF I am unable to sell the bus I will start selling
some of the parts seperately. Like carpet, petronix points, and
other stuff I have for it that is non-essential for the bus to run.
This will allow me to drop the price on the bus and hopefully move it
faster.
I will also consider possible partial trades for a running  bug or a
street motorcycle.
