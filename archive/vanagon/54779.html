Subject: RE: Buzzing Fuel Pump 

By the way, mine failed on my wife's Audi.

It failed after only 60,000 mi, so I checked into a possible cause.

It turned out that a fuel line was kinked between the pump and the engine, as installed by 
the factory.  This caused excessive back pressure and premature pump failure.

You might want to check into this if your pump fails with relatively low mileage.

&gt;My fuel pump made what sounds like the same buzzing sound during a long, 
&gt;hot trip a few years back.  Like yours, it became more frequent until it 
&gt;was almost constant.  At that point I bought a new Bosch one (~$225.) and 
&gt;installed it in the parts store parking lot (less than an hour, easy) in 
&gt;Boulder, CO.  Back home, my mechanic said one could get away with this 
&gt;noise for a while, but it would eventually fail.  He said it puts less 
&gt;strain on it if you keep the gas level higher (I don't remember why).  It 
&gt;sounds like $199. might be a middle 'O the road price.  In the past I 
&gt;used to try and get every last breath out of every part, but since I've 
&gt;gotten more into the peace of mind one can buy by replacing things 
&gt;early.  The law of averages dictates against a breakdown in a convenient 
&gt;place.  I've not heard that noise since.  The first response offers some 
&gt;compelling reasons to replace this critical piece of equipment.  Good 
&gt;Luck! (and disconnect that ground strap if you replace it!)

&gt;&gt; Personally, I would not hesitate to replace an electric fuel pump if there was ANY 
&gt;&gt; indication that it is going bad.  The reasons are:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	1)  Electric fuel pumps are cooled and lubricated by the fuel.  Possible fire
&gt;&gt; 	concerns during failure.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 	2)  A fuel pump failure might dump crap into the fuel injection system, causing
&gt;&gt; 	even higher repair costs.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The last time I replaced a Bosche fuel pump, I found prices ranging from $350 (dealer) to 
&gt;&gt; $150 (mail order).  It is worth it to shop around.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hello,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;	I just found this list and have learnded quite a lot so far.  Maybe
&gt;&gt; &gt;someone has some insight into my problem.  I have an 85 Vanagon Camper
&gt;&gt; &gt;and about two years ago the fuel pump began buzzing(like a digital alarm
&gt;&gt; &gt;clock under the floor) when the weather conditions became very hot(i.e.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 90's).  It only occured under those conditions and usually would take a while to occur 
&gt;&gt; after the engine had been started and warmed up.  Early this summer the pump started to buzz 
&gt;&gt; in cooler and cooler weather until it was buzzing all the time, right from ignition.  It is 
&gt;&gt; now very difficult for passengers to sit back there comfortably.  I have hesitated replacing 
&gt;&gt; it because of the cost($199) and the fact that I have noticed no performance problems.  Any 
&gt;&gt; ideas on other options or another diagnosis?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
