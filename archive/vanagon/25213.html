Subject: 3rd Corner Expedition, and Fond Farewells

This weekend we'll be camping at Mt. Desert (Ba Ha Ba), and mounting a day
trip to Quoddy Head, giving us the third corner. (Key West and the Olympic
Peninsula have already been marked off). Hope Cosmo ('84 Westy) will behave
on what will probably be our last big adventure before the Maine winter.
(Oh, we'll probably hit the White Mts for foliage, and so on....)

And, thanks to all for the help and the great reading: I'll be needing to
unsubscribe for awhile. VW Maine-iacs, I still have a virtually rust-free
'82 Diesel vanagon for sale for a low, low, move it before winter price!     -ed
