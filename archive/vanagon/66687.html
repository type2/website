Subject:      ultrasonic varmit repellers

Often when I go camping I have problems with mice getting into my Westfalia.
I've sealed the front air vents with wire mesh, so I don't think they can
enter that way anymore. The last trip I took, I observed the varmits
blatantly leaping in the open sliding door! I really don't like to keep my
van closed up all the time when camping so I need some way to keep these
pests out. I'm thinking about trying one of those ultrasonic pest repellant
devices, but I'm skeptical as to whether they will really work. Has anyone
tried these devices before? I guess I could start taking a cat with me...
