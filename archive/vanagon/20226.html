So Martha I-should-have-danced-all-night Rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Years back, there was a TV ad for a battery which had a special
&gt; reserve (almost like a second battery within a battery) capability.
&gt; The scene I recall was a guy's wife going into labor - they rushed
&gt; outside to get in the car and go to the hospital, only to find that
&gt; the battery had gone dead.  However, with this special feature,
&gt; they merely had to flip a switch of some sort, which called upon
&gt; the other side of the battery, and the car would start in
&gt; an emergency.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone remember who made this battery?  Or if it is still
&gt; being manufactured?

What's-a-matter Martha?  Did the rabbit die?  ;p

;)
