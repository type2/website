Subject: Solved Syncro Shifter Sympt

        Reply to:   Solved Syncro Shifter Symptoms!

Well, not solved, exactly, but vastly narrowed down.  First, thanks to Joel,
Dennis, Dan, Harvey, Craig and Tim for their feedback on possible causes for
sh*tty shifting on my '89 Syncro (95K miles with a tranny rebuild at 82K).

Craig gets the big *** gold star *** for a combo workaround/diagnostic
technique for the hydraulic clutch.  His tip was based on a minor piece of
evidence in my original post: that *occasionally*, when starting the engine
with the transmission in neutral and the clutch depressed, the van would start
to creep forward a little.  Today when I went to pull back out of the
driveway, I started the engine under just such circumstances and the van
LURCHED backwards.  Put it in 1st and turned it over again and this time it
LURCHED forwards.   

My first thought was, oh man, there's my pilot bearing finally seized up -
then I remembered Craig's advice: pump the clutch to get the hydraulic
pressure up and see if that eliminates the symptoms.  Which it sure enough
did, after half a dozen pumps. Whoo-hoo!  Some sort of clutch master/slave
screwup seems a much more tractable and inexpensive problem to fix than a
totally hosed Syncro tranny (which has already had $2700 worth of work in its
short lifetime.)  This enabled me to drive over to Larry's house, pumping the
clutch while in neutral every few minutes at stop lights and such.

After draining and filling the tranny with new fluid (hell, I'd already bought
a gallon, and it *did* come out pretty grey, with a good bit of metallic fuzz
on the magnetic drain plug) Larry and I tried some more diagnosis, with some
frustration at the lack of detail on this subject in Bentley.  When I got
under Larry's Syncro and looked at how far his slave cylinder shaft travels
(about half again as far as mine, for a total of about 1 inch), that seemed to
point to a hydraulic problem.  Also, however, my slave shaft is motionless
until the clutch pedal is 2/3 towards the floor, but Larry's starts moving
almost immediately as the pedal is depressed.

We tried bleeding the clutch using the valve on top of the slave cylinder, but
we never *did* see any air come out, with fluid emerging on the first clutch
depression.  Does this mean anything?  After all, Bentley mandates and some on
this list have recommended using a power bleeder - what is this thing and
should I use it if I really want to be sure the system is air-free?

[ BTW, when we went to fill the reservoir on the dashboard, there's a little
screen there underneath the cap that the sensor sits down inside of and which
seemed to be somewhat gunked up - does anybody know how to remove this screen
for degunking? It turns and turns but won't pop out.]

Does insufficient travel on the slave cylinder indicate air in the system?
There is no obvious leaking front or rear from the master or slave cylinders
At least from looking at Bentley, there doesn't seem to be any particular
mechanical adjustment for amount of travel, offset, etc. that could have gone
out of whack, either on the slave OR the master.  (Well, OK, there's one
little adjustment on the clevis between the pushrod and the master cylinder
piston that I haven't checked yet - could that be so far out of spec?)

As usual, any and all diagnostic speculations are explicitly invited.  Who
knows, there might be a gold star in it for you!

Thanks,
