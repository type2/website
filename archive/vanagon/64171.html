&gt;       YOKOHAMA Y370 vs Y356
&gt;       
&gt;       The confusion reigns! Yokohama has called back and now says 
&gt;       the following is the official, true story:
&gt;       
&gt;       The Y370 series (passenger and light truck) was discontinued 
&gt;       a few years ago, except for the Y370 LT 195/75R14, which was 
&gt;       kept in production because it was an OEM tire (for which 
&gt;       vehicle, she couldn't remember) and because Vanagon owners 
&gt;       kept calling Yokohama asking for it.
&gt;       
&gt;       The Y370 is being phased out and the official replacement, 
&gt;       according to Yokohama, is the Y356 LT 195/75R14.
&gt;       
&gt;       The major differences are:
&gt;       - tread pattern
&gt;       - the Y370 is a non-reinforced sidewall 8-ply
&gt;       - the Y356 is a reinforced sidewall, comes in 6- or 8-ply
&gt;       
&gt;       Anyone out there using a Y356? Please respond with your 
&gt;       comments and I will add those to the Y370 and Michelin rants 
&gt;       and raves.

This information has been at http://www.vanagon_dot_com/info/faq.html for at
least six months :-).
