Subject: Re: 83 Sink's 12V water pump

The immersible water pump was used on US market Westys from the middle of 82
(Westy SN C00859 on) thru 91.  Canadian market Westy's used the
&quot;Outside-of-the-Tank&quot; water pump 80-91. US Models 80-Early 82 (Westy SN
C00858 and back) used the outside-of-the-tank pump as well.  Trivia - this
outside pump is the same as used on 74-79 Westy's as well, although VW until
recently, used two different part numbers.

Immersible pump was made by a company called &quot;Komet&quot; in Germany and was
recently bought and taken over by VDO in the last year or so.  We buy 'em
direct from Europe and sell 'em for $49.95US (V_at_L members' price is
$44.96)(VAG's price is $71.65US at your &quot;friendly&quot; dealer).  Order BBI P/N
230-10102

Outside-the tank pump is made in USA and we get $39.95US (V_at_L members' price
is $35.96US)(VAG  is a whopping $105.25US!) and is the identical until sold
by the so-called &quot;friendly&quot; dealers.  Order BBI P/N 230-10101.  Comes with
Fuse too.

The immersible pump on my 84 Westy works fine.  The PO must have had some
problems, because I found a brand new spare wrapped in plastic in one of the
closets when I got it a month and a half ago.
