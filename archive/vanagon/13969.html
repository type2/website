Subject: Vanagon ATF Cooler Replaced

Just FYI for those that read a few weeks ago about my ATF cooler leaking 
problem. Thanks to Joel for pointing me in the right direction.

It was not too difficult to drop the frontend of the tranny and pull the 
ATF cooler off. Ordered a new one from the dealer along with 4 little 
O-rings. It went right back on and buttened up nicely. Replaced the 
coolant with new blue goo (autobahn). Drained and refilled the tranny 
about 4 times. Probably have to do this 2 more times to geet back to 
clear red color.

One of my local club guys called me to tell me that my ATF was not going 
to survive getting coolant in the tranny. Seems that most US AT's have 
clutches made of some kind of compressed fiberboard stuff which will 
absorb the antifreeze and disolve the adhesive. I checked the Bentley 
(gee I love that book) manual and it said the clutches were plastic so 
maybe I am going to be OK. I have put &gt; 500 miles on it. Runs strong. No 
problems (so far).

Thanks to those who helped and commiserated. I love this list!
