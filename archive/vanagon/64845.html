Subject:      EV AC/Heat controls

I have a '93 EV MV (my second). The AC/Heat control for the front does
not light up. At night you cannot see the controls at all. Do I have a
bulb out or is this the way it's meant to be. My first EV did the same
thing. I didn't have it long enough to be looked at.
                        Thanks Rod in west Texas
