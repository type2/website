Hey all,
I finally got the parts I've been waiting for for my '78.  The new oil
pressure switch, the seat belt hangers, and a couple of heater hoses all
came today.

The oil pressure switch was pretty easy to replace, tho I had to
purchase a deep reach socket to do it.  New one is now in, no more
leaks!  Yay!

The seat belt hangers were very easy to install where the old ones used
to be before they broke.  Boy, do they make a world of difference!  NO
more untangling the seat belt before putting it on, no more sitting on
it when getting in the car.  Of course, I'm still in the habit of taking
it off and putting it on the seat when I get where I'm going, but I'm
working on that :) .

Got some new hose for the heater blower fan -- heat exchanger route
in the engine compartment.  The old ones were held together by duct tape
so I got some nice new stuff.  It's very sturdy stuff, the inside being
standard brown cardboard, then a layer of aluminum, then on the outside
it's strong black paper.  They say &quot;made in Germany&quot; on them and I got
them from RMMW.  They're a bit more expensive than the standard paper
hose but they seem worth it.  

Sean
