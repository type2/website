Subject: Re: upgrading 86-up headlights


I agree that the stock square headlights are very disappointing with
respect to the low beam light output. I feel the major problem with my
lights is the pitting that can be seen on the silver reflective
coating.

I have not been able to find anyone who will &quot;refoil&quot; the back of
these lights.

I fixed my light problem by installing a set of Hella Auxillary Low
Beams. These rectangular lights are mounted on the bumper and look like
fog or driving lights. When properly aimed, they do not interfere with
oncoming traffic.

They have improved my low beam output tremendously, and also throw a
lot of light to the sides.

I highly recommend these lights for those people looking for better
low beams.
