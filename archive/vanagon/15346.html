Subject: Re: Sliding Door Silencer?

&gt;So Tim Smith says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;My '86 is a GREAT machine, but when the sliding door is opened at 2AM, 
&gt;&gt; &gt;everyone in camp knows what YOU are doing. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; HaHa, so you pee'd out of the vent windows yet? The only solution to your 
&gt;&gt; problem that I've found is to go out the front door, just pull in on the 
&gt;&gt; door handle as you open the latch. Less of a telltale 'pop' that way. tim s.
&gt;
&gt;Or.... You can get a porta-potti.

Actually, VW also thought of this in a kind of low tech way.  When I got my 
'73 Campmobile, it had a plastic bucket (about 4 gallon size) with a plastic 
lid, and a toilet seat that fit on the top.  For the '73, it fit in the rear 
facing seat storage area.  Kind of a waste of space, but we used it lots 
with the children along.
