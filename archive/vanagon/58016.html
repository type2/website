&gt; At one point, when I attempted to turn the engine off, the key was stuck in
&gt;  the on position. I was able to turn it enough to stop the engine, but I
had
&gt;  unplug the wire harness from the switch and hot wire it to get home
&gt;  (praying the whole way that the steering lock wouldn't engage) because the
&gt;  lock was completely jammed. My question is this; can the electrical switch
&gt;  part be separated from the key cylender 

Yes.

&gt;or do they have to be replaced together? 

No.

&gt;Is it possible that a short caused the electrical contacts to fuse together?

I haven't seen that before, but it seems possible to me.

Good luck,
