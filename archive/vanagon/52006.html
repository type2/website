So JonR says:
&gt; 
&gt; That's odd... on my '85 you push the lever toward the dash till get
&gt; adequate washer fluid on the rear window, then let the lever go... it
&gt; spring returns to the off position and the wiper makes a few more cycles
&gt; then parks on its' own... are later models different or is your Switch
&gt; broken Steven...??

Well... it depends on how you want to use it.  I tap it lightly because I
don't always want to use the fluid.  If you push harder then yes, it behaves
the way you discribe.  

Ya know, this thread could get really raunchy..... ;)
