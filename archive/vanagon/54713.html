&gt;I personally enjoy reading EVERYTHING from EVERYONE on ANY SUBJECT on
&gt;V_at_L.
&gt;I've learned VERY MUCH from the contributors.
&gt;I've bought things from the list (Syncro air filters for example).
&gt;I've used knowledge gained here to save time, money and anxiety.
&gt;I've laughed at the wit.
&gt;
&gt;THERE IS A PLACE FOR ALL.

&gt;Go ahead, tell me I'm alone.

Larry, I do agree with you. I am one of the lurkers here as a rule,
but I proudly display my Vanagon Listserv sticker in the back window
of my bus and can thank members of the group for steering me in the
right direction when it was time for me to buy new struts for my rear
hatch. I think the commercial posts to this group have been just as
important to me the other posts (although I do love hearing the
stories about trips members have made). The part of Kentucky is
Volkswagon Parts Hell and I do need to keep a list of low priced
honorable parts places I can deal with or the VW will have to go as I
can't afford the places close to home.

Just my 'lil-ole opinion,
Doug
