Subject: Next CCC campout 7/25-7/27

Howdy,

Just a reminder that the next CCC campout is rapidly approaching.  The
location will be the Escondido Campground in Los Padres National Forest.
This campground features a cool, clean deep-water swimming hole and various
cliffs from which you can dive, the highest 30' above the water.  There are
also hiking trails and large shady oaks.  The dates are July 25th - 27th.

I will be arriving early on the 25th and reserving spots for folks who plan
to attend.  If you are going to attend, please send me your name, license
plate number, and the number of people / vehicles in your party and I will
reserve a spot for you.  According to the park service, this campground
does fill up on weekends.  The cost is $8 / night.

For more information and directions, see
http://www.vanagon_dot_com/journeys/ccc/ or subscribe to the CCC mailing list
by sending a letter to ccc-request_at_vanagon_dot_com containing the line:

Also NOTE that due to a disk problem, the CCC mailing list was wiped, so if
you haven't resubscribed, you need to do so!

Thanks!
Coyote
