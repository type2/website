Subject: LAST CALL for LIST T-SHIRTS!!!!!!


HEADS UP! this is now officially your last chance to order a spring run of the
t-shirt. I have a really low amount of orders, so I am hoping I will even be
able to cover the cost of printing. Anywaym there is NO WAY I will be able to
afford even 1 extra, so if you want a shirt, MAIL the order NOW!!!!!!!!
I am planning to place the order Wednesday.
Thanks...here are the details:
Allrighty, then. As there is enough demand for another batch, I'll have to do
them. Please note that I will be doing TWO (2) different designs this time. One
is the standard list shirt of the past, with different colors and same design,
and the other is a split window design, that I will post about later.

VANAGON LIST T-SHIRTS:

Description:
&gt; high-quality all-cotton, short-sleeved t-shirts, most likely in a blue color.
&gt; the design can be viewed at my website:
   http://www4.ncsu_dot_edu/eos/users/r/rapalmer/www/
&gt; For those without web access, the shirt features line drawings of the front
   views of all 4 generations of busses. The word &quot;NETVERGNUGEN&quot; is across the
   top of the shirt, and the list address runs across the bottom. The shirt
        features 5 different colors, and is not cheesy or cheap.

Pricing information:
 &gt;t-shirts cost $16.00 each, which includes postage and handling. Orders of
multiple t-shirts will still cost $16.00 each, as postage increases with each
shirt.
&gt; NON-USA orders please add $5.00 PER SHIRT for foreign postage.
&gt; Shirts are available in S,M, L, and XL for this price.
&gt; For shirts in sizes XXL, add $2.00.

Ordering Information:
 please send a check to:
Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC
27605-1832
Foreign orders, please send US cash, as that is the easiest way.

IMPORTANT: include in your order the following:
 an index card with the following information:
 name, mailing address, e-mail address, SIZE of shirt, number of shirts

If you don't include this information, then how can I send the shirt to the
 right place?
ORDERS MUST BE IN BY FRIDAY, APRIL 26 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


DISCLAIMER:
 Out of over 100 shirts, I have only had the misfortune of having 1 lost in the
mail.  However, I can't afford to cover the cost of lost shirts, so if this
unfortunately happens, then I am sorry, but I can't replace it.

Stickers:
 if you want stickers, this would be a good time to get them. See Sticker
ordering information about those.

Anyway,
please get those orders in the mail, so I can place the order on time. I CAN
NOT afford to order extra shirts, so if you don't order one now, you won't get
one. Sorry, that's just the tight budget I'm on.
 So, then, order away!!!! If anyone has any questions as to the quality and
desirablilty of the shirts, there are many folks who can vouch for them.
Anyway, ENJOY!
