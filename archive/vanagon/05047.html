I don't know where you are, but my experience with the VW dealer in Olympia was
excellent. The fellow took me in when it was a long weekend even though I
didn't have any appointment. I broke down on the Friday afternoon, and he
squeezed me in, put in a new starter, and I was on my way within 2 hours. Now
that's service! Of course that was 2 years ago, but I expect it is still good.
Nobody does stuff like that anymore up here in Canada. Our local dealer is a
$^%$$#_at_%!! geek! I wouldn't send my mother-in-law there! 
Anyway, check out the Olympia dealer, he was way beyond the call of duty.
Luck,
Courtney
