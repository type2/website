Subject: shakedown trip with infant

 &gt;&gt; Clearly this technique isn't going to work once she's more mobile - I don't
want to find her sleeping in the foot well by the sliding door! Has anyone
come up with any interesting tricks to keep a sleeping infant confined safely?
&lt;&lt;

 Do you still have the box she came in?

 Seriously, we used the cardboard box provided by Ballard Hospital to take our
first infant camping.  It had a thin pad on the bottom, high sides so the kid
could not escape, and handy handles on the ends for easy transport.  We'd tuck
young Teddy in for the night and set the box on the fold up table.  First time
Mom could reach him quickly for those frequent feedings and first time Dad
could get a full nights sleep, important in those early months of child
rearing.
