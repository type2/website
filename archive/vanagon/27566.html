&gt; Automobile-based &quot;planning&quot; has created cities where it is considered 
&gt; acceptable to spend a couple of hours in the morning, and a couple of 
&gt; hours in the evening, crawling along a clogged highway with a few other 
&gt; hundred thousand similarly herded unfortunates.  Maybe the situation is 
&gt; worse in the vancouver area than elsewhere, but rush-hour travel time by 
&gt; car from, say , downtown to a major suburb like Surrey or Twawwassen is 
&gt; at least 1 1/2 hours and usually more since some bozo typically runs out 
&gt; of gas in the middle of a critical bridge along the way.  Three hours or 
&gt; more every day driving in rush hour traffic jams?  

This happens a lot here in California, where the affordable housing for the
San Francisco Bay area is over several ridges in the Central Valley.
(Approximately 1-3 hours each way.)  I know someone who lives in the Sierra
and commutes.

There are alternatives, however.  Both my boyfriend and I work from our
homes, as does every other employee of Chaco.  Before we started this
company, we lived 2.5 miles away from work, and we biked to work and back.

It's nice not having to drive to work.
