&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what type of steel is used in the WB head studs? I'm

&gt; &gt; Im guessing that it's the same kind as on air-cooled engines, so there 
&gt; &gt; might be a source to look up for that. If you know, I promise noone will

You're right. It is a project for school. It's an industrial validation 
test station that VW will be using in their plant. I hope that makes you 
feel more secure.

What is this crap?? Eric, if you're 14 years old I can understand this, 
but you're obviously not. I dont care who you are or what you do, but 
keep this crap off the list.
