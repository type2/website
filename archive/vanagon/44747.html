&gt;  But there's still hope. A gentleman named Tommy Sandham has
&gt;  written a book titled 'Panel Craft', by Willow Publishing,
&gt;  Barecroft Common, Magor, Newport, Gwent, NP6 3EB. (Apparently,
&gt;  that is what passes for a street address in England. Good luck.)
&gt;
&gt;  The British Library Cataloguing in Publication Data spif reads:
&gt;
&gt;  Sandham, Tommy Panel Craft; Featuring Ford Cortina MK.1 bodyshell
&gt;  restoration. 1. Automobiles -- Conservation and restoration --
&gt;  Amateur manuals
&gt;
&gt;  I Title 629.28'722 TL152.2
&gt;
&gt;  ISBN 0-9512523-0-5
&gt;
&gt;  The truly unique thing about Mr. Sandham's book is that it will
&gt;  show you auto-body repair from the non-professional point of
&gt;  view; it offers a glimpse of reality. This is a book without
&gt;  glitter. The repairs, while functional, do not have the polished
&gt;  perfection that comes from thirty years of experience. This rare
&gt;  viewpoint makes it clear that the novice is indeed capable of
&gt;  doing his own bodywork.
&gt;
&gt;  I do not mean to speak disparagingly of Mr. Sandham's efforts,
&gt;  but offer him sincere congratulations. He has done us all a
&gt;  service.


If anyone has been looking for this book, I found it through Classic
Motorbooks 800/826-6600. It's $31.95.

Cheers,

Bren
