Subject: Re: EV Westy spotted?


Speaking of different looking late model VW Vans....
Last night I saw a Vanagon Westfalia Multivan.  This is one incredible 
looking piece of German engineering.  It was navy blue all over, 
including the poptop, and there was a family of 5 riding in it.
They stopped in front of the video store and one of the kids got out to 
return a movie.  Looks-wise, this thing blows almost any Vanagon out of 
the water.  Anyone know how many of these were made, during what years, 
and how much they go for now??  Not that I could afford one of these now, 
but the future looks bright for one.
