&gt;my ex boyfriend would drop the motor to change the generator.   If you have a
&gt;doghouse cooler you do have to pull the motor.  also if the thermostat is
&gt;hooked up.    I've done it with it in the bus, with a standard oil cooler, no
&gt;thermostat.      you DO need to get both side screw/nuts out.       i leave
&gt;out that bottom screw on the left of the four holding the generator tin onto
&gt;the fanhousing tin.

I've changed the generator on a doghouse cooler, single port 1600 in my '70
and '71.  It wasn't so bad, once I remembered to unscrew the thermostat from
it's shaft.  After removing the screws on either side of the fan housing and
the generator strap and belt and 4 bolts on the fan plate, I remove the
carburator for extra room.  Then it's just a matter of lifting the fan
housing so it touches the engine compartment ceiling and coaxing the
generator out.  Not so bad once you know the routine!
