&gt;a 31.5&quot; tire, go to a 15 inch wheel,(think Mercedes or Eurovan).  Then you can 
&gt;use a 235/75-15XL or a 31-10.50/15 tire for your 31&quot;.  Spacer can be made to 
&gt;increase clearance between the tire and the control arms.  As for the gear 

...this sounds interesting. I'd like to see how that spacer thing would work.

&gt;ratio, tire diameter does effect torque, however the distance traveled per 
&gt;revolution is determined by the circumference. This is the proper way to 
&gt;determine gear ratio needed.  It may also be feasible to replace the 4th gear 
&gt;instead of both ring and pinions.  This would be a relatively low cost way to 
&gt;change the final drive ratio.  

Yes, but not for off-road driving. For that, you want the low gears,
especially the creeper, as low as possible.

&gt;As for using stiffer springs and shocks, this 
&gt;are only beneficial in competition type situations.  When on uneven terrain, 
&gt;whatever flex the suspension does not provide has to be taken up by the 
&gt;chassis.  Jack up one wheel and note how the doors no longer fit properly.  
&gt;Want that to happen as you drive through the woods?  I can see taller springs 
&gt;for increased ground clearance, but be careful changing the spring rate. 
&gt;Anyway, that my 2 cents for the day.

Hummm...

If I am not mistaken, looking through the archives on &quot;Winkler,&quot; based on an
old post of Helmut's, you can choose from Winkler the exact spring rate that
you want. Perhaps an intermediate stiffening would be a good idea rather
than the full-on Seikel.

&gt;Keep on dreaming'

Hey! Some of this stuff *will* get done.

&gt;Is that all their is to it?
&gt;
&gt;Now all we have to determine is how narrow a 31.5&quot; tall tire would have to
&gt;be to fit in the wheelwells with the 16&quot;/sawzall/plastic-wheelwell setup
&gt;without bumping into other suspension components, such as springs, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Thomas, are you telling me you don't know this off the top of your head?
&gt;
&gt;If so, then its on to the microfiche, to study what parts to order to change
&gt;ring and pinion to 6.14.

&gt;&gt;Hi Derek,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;straight ratio 6.13/4.86 x 25&quot; = 31.5&quot;  yeeehaw! that ratio is for
&gt;&gt;TD-16&quot; which is worst case, poor power + big wheels, wonder if it can
&gt;&gt;break 55mph?   cheers, tim
