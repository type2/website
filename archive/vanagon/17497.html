Should you have any comments, questions or concerns about your rental,
please contact the manager where you rented your vehicle.  If after doing
so, you are still in need of assistance, kindly call me at (301) 670-8649

always welcome and appreciated.

Thank you,
Edward L. McCarty

Your rental cars are entirely insufficient for any type of pursuit
situation.  Cornering in city streets at any speed over 50 miles per hour
results in excessive tire slippage and near overturning.  Were it not for
my superior driving ability, the irate Iranian clerk and police cruisers
surely would have apprehended me.  Fortunately, portions of the exhaust
system fell in the cruiser's path.

Is it really to much to ask that your cars be capable of speeds over 110
miles per hour?  Over my entire trip of some 1800 miles (weekend rate) I
was able to coax your &quot;Dodge Shadow&quot; to 108 only once-- and then only
downhill.  Unfortunately a noxious blue cloud seems to pour forth from
the auto at this speed.  I hope to continue as a loyal Enterprise
customer, please see to these problems _IMMEDIATELY_.

Also please add sufficient storage space for beer bottles.  Empties roll
about the footwells during extreme cornering, creating a _hazard_.

I do want to compliment the perky rental agent &quot;Jen&quot; who was very
understanding-- even though I could not produce my driver's license at
the time.  Here is a customer service agent who understands that
_customers_ and not some artificial &quot;rules&quot; should dictate proper policy.
 It
is employees like Jen who endear me to Enterprise Rent-a-Car and insure
my repeat business.
