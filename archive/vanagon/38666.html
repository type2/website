Subject: Hey Vanagon Ric!

Hey Ric, what's yer opinion on the Kelly brand tires? I used them on 
my much missed 71 Kombi, had no problemos with them. Are they made 
well?  My current ride is a 89 Vanagon GL that I LOVE like crazy. I 
havent been able to name it yet! The previous owner put on Michelins, 
I can't afford them so I'll be going back to my pals at Allen 
Tires(they know me well, the 71 was a tire eater) and getting my 
185R14s. 
Also, I've got a Covercraft brand bra for the beast, I've got one 
tiny problem...the lowest metal hooker thingy cannot be curled into 
the door jam since there's the fancy body trim &amp; the door rubber is 
really a pain...is there a way I cant get this thing on? Other than 
that the bra fits pretty good and looks cool.
If you got any hints...please, I'd love to hear (or read) 'em!        
Buslady
