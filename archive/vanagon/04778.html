Subject: Re: question of oil level


Hey joel....at least the EuroVan can travel up steep hills at 70
mph WITH the A/C on full WITHOUT loosing speed!!! So there...so 
what if I can't get to the spark plugs without unhinging the
radiator...I'll only change plugs 4 or 5 times...I go up (and
down) hills much more than that!!!!


To take a quote from Forest Gump :  Vanagon is as Vanagon does, sir!
