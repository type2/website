Just a data point to consider... My cat was gutted out years ago and I've 
never failed a test in Oregon as a result. Of course PA emissions could be 
more stringent. Should I feel guilty?

|           Dealer  EuroParts  PartsPlace
| muffler    $386     $179       $199
| cat        $166     $275       $149
| 
| What a price range! So I'm getting the muffler from EuroParts

| the cat from PartPlace, it pays to shop
