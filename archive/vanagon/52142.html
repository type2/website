Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

hmm...just like the one John Muir describes....:)

but, for use poor aircooleds alleast, the problem i see with that is the 
haveing to reinstall your sparkplu..in a hot head...not exactly highly 
recommended, you know? i assume that the device itsself doesnt have to be 
in to tight...and as long as you dont cross thread you shouldnt have much 
trouble there, but, when you have the plug left...you know? hmm...a $75+ 
head, not including labor&lt;your own, or someone elses&gt;, a helicoil, 
&lt;again, the head removal&gt; or a bunch of cheap electrics..or a hand or 
foot pump, if thats your preference..:)


anyhow.....david

&gt; I have a cool pump that works off the engine. It screws into a spark plug
&gt; hole and has a fairly long hose that attaches to the valve stem. It works
&gt; very quickly. I'll try to get the name of it and post it to the list.
