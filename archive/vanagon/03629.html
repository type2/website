Subject: Fuel consumption again...

    Sorry to be such a pest, but it seems my original message got cut 
    off or something.  The major difference between my old '72 and my 
    new '72 is the size 'o the engine
    
    old - dual port 1600
    new - 2.0 litre, dual carb.
    
    and the fact the new one is a camper.  
    
    I think I'd rather have the performance of the larger engine, but 
    if there are any helpful ideas about increasing gas mileage out 
    there....  
    
    Thanks again
    Eric
