Subject: Alldata corporation database access
Date: Fri, 28 Apr 95 13:39:21 MDT

Does anyone know how to access the Alldata Corp. database on vehicle tech 
service bullitins and repair proceedures.  I got the web address from this list 
but all I can get is an account number that is supposed to be good for 10 free 
minutes of access.  There doesn't seem to be anyway to get to the database so 
that you can use the account number from the web server.  Do you use FTP, Gopher 
or Netscape to get at this?  I am starting to suspect that this is a flim-flam 
site designed to suck in credit card numbers (which is why I'm not going repeat 
the site address that I already have).
