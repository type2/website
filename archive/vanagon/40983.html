&gt; Ahhh!  I had no idea there would be so much traffic on this mailing list.
&gt; Is there any interest in switching over to a News group?  Has this already
&gt; been discussed?  I took yesterday off and had over 150 messages.  

This threat inevitably comes back up.  No newsgroup.  We like it a 
mailing list.
