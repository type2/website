Subject:  OIL PRESSURE WARNING

I'm a total newcomer to the list, motivated like others I suspect because I have or may have a
problem with my 1986 Transporter 1900 cc petrol water cooled. Apologies before I go on if the
following has been subject of previous debate.

The problem is the drop in oil pressure as indicated by the warning light and buzzer on
deceleration from speed (say in excess of 75mph when leaving motorway  onto services slip
road).

I experienced this problem about four yers ago when the van had reached 87,000 miles and a
build up of sludge deposits was identified as the cause of the problem due apparently to
insufficient care in changing oil at the specified interval or insufficient quality of oil. The vehicle
was in fact maintained regularly by a VW specialist garage.

The only solution offered by my garage was a short engine replacement which did reslove the
problem. The possibility of cleaning out the sludge was apparently not an option, if indeed this
was the cause of the problem.

Now it may be that I have the problem again, I'm not sure at present as it was only yesterday
that the warning light came on for the first time since the engine replacement (mileage now
130,000 ie approximately 40,000 on the short engine). I'm hoping, of course,  that this is not the
start of futher problems and it would be very interesting to know of others experiences of this
and I indeed if I do have a problem, that  there is alternative solution other than another short
engine.

Looking forward to your responses


Regards


David Ludlow
