If the setup is similar to the earlier 82 models, the leak may be due to a
breakdown/deterioration in the overflow  rubber connectors between the
filler pipe and tank. Although ours does not leak, the smell of gas in the
compartment is present when the tank has been filled. Squeeze all rubber
lines and check for small cracks. This could be the cause.....
