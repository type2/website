 What I would like you to do is order a set as described above (I'll buy 5)
 and replace the UniRoyals.  You should also update your tire reference
manual
 to include a higher rating for Vanagon Campers.

When I searched for Yokahamas, the local Costco told me they couldn't order
the Y370's due to a &quot;contracts problem with Yokohama.&quot;  I had the exact same
data you used as well.

I finally went to another tire dealer closer to the city.
