Subject: Useful Tool--FibreOptic Scope

I've been wanting to get a fibreoptic scope for use in looking in to the
cavitites of my van to see where rust is beginning to form. 

I was thinking of getting a used scope that a Doctor considers no longer
reliable enough to perform arthriscopic operations with.

I also saw some fibreoptic scopes for about $500 in the Edmund Scientific
catalog. 

I haven't the first idea about these things or where to find a used one. Can
anybody illuminate us?
