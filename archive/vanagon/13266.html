Subject: Starting drill
Date: Wed, 15 Mar 95 10:56:43 PST

&gt;From a couple of years at Delta Jct. AK, I recall a starting drill for cars  
used by a fellow gummint employee.

1.  Make 1qt strong coffee.

2.  Steel oneself against the elements with a cup of same.

3.  Don Arctic Parka, anti-contact gloves and bunnyboots.

4.  Go outside and loudly confront the vehicle with your imminent intentions
    of starting same.

5.  Return to shelter.

6.  Steel oneself against the elements with another cup.

7.  Set the motor oil on the space heater to warm.  You DID drain the oil 
    and plug in the block heater, battery plate, and warmer last night 
    DIDN'T YOU?

8.  If the answer to 7 is no, call a friend for a ride to work.

9.  After reading more of the Sunday NY Times, Fairbanks News-Miner or your
    favorite, check the temperature of the oil.  It should be 180F or hotter.

10. Schlep the hot oil out to the recalcitrant vehicle and loudly announce 
    your intentions and then fill the crankcase with the oil.

11. Return to shelter.

12. Steel oneself against the elements with another cup.

13. Check windchill and go back outside.

14. Loudly  announce your intentions of starting the beast and then get in
    and crank for 3 seconds.

15. Get out and influence the outcome by spritzing ethyl ether into the 
    air intake.

16. One bash on the starter and vroom!, life is good.

17. Go back inside, pay the rent on the coffee.

18. Finish paper.  Steel oneself against the elements with another cup.

19. Back outside, crawl into warm (~20F) vehicle and lump off to work.
    (Lumping until the first turn so the squared off tires aren't syncronized)

20. Compliment the vehicle on it's reliability, creature comforts, cold weather
    performance and promise new parts in the spring.

Usually worked for me.  alf (former resident dweeb at Donnelly Dome SatTracking
