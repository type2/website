Just heard from fellow listie, Fred, up in Alaska, who had some 
insights on next year's trip to the top of the planet.  First, though,
he recommends Prudhoe Bay - isn't this further north than Inuvik?  Help!



--------

from Fred:

I have made this trip numerous times (from Fairbanks to San Francisco).
We love to come down for the AYH bike ride through the city, held each
June.  To answer your questions:
1.  Figure approximately $750 for gas round trip either Inuvik or Prudhoe
Bay.
2.  Food costs depend upon the cuisine and number of people.  We
generally figure $20-30/day for a family of 7.  We buy food in grocery
stores and cook our own.  Of course the kids know every McDonald's on the
Alcan.  Last one is in Whitehorse (on the way up).
3.  Not one of your questions, but I would suggest going to Prudhoe Bay
over Inuvik for a variety of reasons.  One - there are several hot
springs in the Fairbanks area accessible by road.  In fact - go to the
library and check out &quot;Hot Springs and Hot Pools of the Northwest&quot;.  An
absolute must for travelers.  With the kids (I have 4 daughters, 1 son) we
travel from hot springs to hot springs.  Most of the campgrounds in the
North do not have shower facilities.  Second - you get to see Alaska.
There is at least one listserve member here in the state, and I've
offered to make whatever arrangements I can.  I'm a pilot and have a
plane on floats in the summer (wheels or skis the rest of the time).
That is really the only way to see Alaska.  They have a fantastic museum
here at the University, a great salmon bake, unbelievable river boat
(paddle wheeler), permafrost tunnels, Alaska pipeline, etc.
