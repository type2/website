Subject: FS - '86 Vanagon GL 

Hi Vanatics,

  I have a some friends who need to get rid of their '86 Vanagon GL.  It has
an automatic transmission, is blue in color,  has 134k miles on it and has a
slight leak in the head gaskets.  It runs well and looks good.  Has the usual
surface rust on the front seams.  They can't afford to put the money in a
rebuild.  They are asking $1000 for the vehicle.  If interested, the owners
can be contacted at jbabb_at_dave-world_dot_net.  The van is located in central
Illinois.
