Subject: re:Passing and the slow lane

All,

Someone(in my usual level of brilliance I deleted his message) wrote
about the local rural Texans pulling over on 2 lane roads to let others
past. In fact it is a given that if you are driving on a 2 lane rural
hiway and there is a wide shoulder, you move over to let others pass.
Those who do not get even tougher treatment from other drivers, than
those who drive slow in the passing lane in the Northeast(at least while
I lived there not passing in the passing lane was worthy of highbeams in
the rearview mirror, being cutoff, flipped off, et al). One thing to be
careful of on those hiways, in Texas it is a ticketable offense to drive
on the shoulders, and if a cop is near by, the driver will cut you off
to get back on the road to avoid a ticket.

More cheers from the slow lane,

David
