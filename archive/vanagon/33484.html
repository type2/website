&gt;P.P.S.  Any suggestions as to how to protect semaphores from theft? Locking
&gt;devices, inscribed numbers, etc.?  Remember, old Buses got 'em too, I
think.
&gt;Assuming I ever FIND replacements. . .

How about an aux battery, isolator, ticker with a switch under the
dash, all wired to a pair of Bosch Blue Coils?

Makes me wonder if the anti-theft device shown in the RoboCop movie,
didn't have more merit than was portrayed.
