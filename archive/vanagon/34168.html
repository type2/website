Subject: Ordering spare parts from the USA


Ordering spare parts from the USA

&gt;Can anyone send me phone numbers of VW parts dealers in the US ... it
&gt;sounds like it might be cheaper
&gt;Shipping could be a killer (+import duty?tax?). Worth asking tho...


Sarah,
        I've done this many times. I find that by time duty and tariffs are
payed up, the cost can close in on the local rate, but you can also take
the opportunity to order a few other things, which may not always so easily
available over here.
        I have worked out a few routines when ordering. The first is that I
always insist that the package be sent by 1st class, (I think they call it
express) US post, and not through any private courier, such as UPS or
whatever. Private courier cost a fortune when sending overseas. Many of the
mail order houses say this is not so but I've been faced with some crazy
bills for foreign deliver . They call this an extra handling charge. I was
once charged $150 USA on a $50 package. Needless to say, I told the fellow
to send it back.
        As bad as this sounds, the normal express mail rates will get the
package to me in about 5 days of ordering. I've used Rocky Mountain,
Wolfsberg West and BFY. My impression was that Rocky mtn. people are
sometimes a little too eagre and maybe not really hearing what you're
asking for and just waiting for the credit card number. I like BYF and
Wolfsberg because they seem sincere, and they use VW parts codes. This
helps avoid confusion.
        My second tip is always pay with a credit card. This is your
insurance. If there is a problem you can cancel (or threaten to cancel) the
charge. This makes the shops sit up and pay attention. If you send a check,
it will take time to clear, and the bank will charge a transfer fee.
        My last tip is what I do when parts don't have to be here
yesterday. I have the parts addressed to a  family address in the US, when
it arrives they just a rip off all the labels and post it again. The
package will then be sent directly to me, and bypass the customs house, and
their 28% charge. So if you've got any contacts, its a worth while option.
        Lastly why not try calling VW Custom and Speed Parts, in Sweden.
They're quite good at finding parts for my, though the brake components you
require are not listed in the catalogue I have. Nevertheless they're
friendly and helpful, and they speak english. Telephone (Sweden) 042-22 59
40, or 22 59 41 or 22 59 42. They have a telefax number 042-22 59 44.

Good luck.
        a last thought: I've never payed for postal insurance. After an
untolled number of order over the years I've never lost a package, so I
don't no what to recomend. Is it worth the extra expense?
