Subject: Restoration references

 Hi Bus/Volkspeople! Hope you are all doing good. Now, like always, to the
point.

 The need for restoration references (books, manuals, etc.) prompted me to
ask the kind people of the list. The project will involve a 1956 Bus. Are
there books that are Bus specific? Help and comments are appreciated. TIA
