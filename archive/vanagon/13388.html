Subject: Any body ever try this??


Hello All,

	I am curious as to what other people out side of california
do for heat in there buses.  I haven't driven one through a minesota
winter yet, but I can't imagine it would be enjoyable.  My '72 doesn't
even have the heat pipe running from the engine to the front of the
vehical (I aquired the bus from a dealer after some guy from cali. blew up
the engine on a cross county trip).  As I am planing to run this bus in
the winter next year I was curious what others due for heat?  I am thinking
of buying some header wrap and wrapping the heat exchangers with it.  It
is intended to keep heat in the exhaust and engine bay temps lower (usually
you don't see it unless on race cars), But it would seem to me that if you
can keep the temp inside the heat exchangers higher that your availible
heating capacity would be higher, of course I only got a &quot;C&quot; in thermodynamics
so I would like to know if anyone else has tried this and how well it 
works.  Hell, worst case you wouldn't get anymore heat, but you would
lower engine temp!!!  I know this stuff works, it lowered the temp in 
a friends '34 benz replica 20+ degrees (chev. v-8 powered).

Any other sugestions on heating a bus when it's 20 below out!!

thanks
