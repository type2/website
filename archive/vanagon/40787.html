Subject: Re:Door window seals noise

We have lived with this problem for years - the family call it the resident
birdlife screech!
We have just had all the rubbers and seals replaced..and the problem is almost
gone..unless the wind is strong and in a certain diredtion. Our noise was /is
located in the quarter light..and we used to open it a little. Not much help
I'm afraid...but at least your not the only one with this!
