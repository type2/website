Dan,

  I've seen Or_felt_ the vibration symptom before!

  We tried MANY things to cure this one ;

  Replace the driveline with a New One.  Still there.  Took the
driveline off noise and feeling went away?  Old driveline back on, noise
back!  Humm.

  After closer inspection we found that the exhaust pipe from 1-3 was
touching the Subframe at a certain speed and load causing this noise and
vibration.

  I guess a combination of the Rear Motor Mounts, along with the Trans
mount becoming weak, the engine and trans sagged enough to let the pipe
touch!

  Our customer was a budget minded one, he wanted us to clearance the
subframe.  We cut a &quot;slot&quot; in it so the pipe had room to move.  We
didn't take away anything from the structure of the subframe doing
this.  The slot is about 1&quot; by 5&quot;'s.

  I've heard other people having this problem too?  I've told a few
people about this scenerio and others have found it too.  Ironically we
had a second Syncro at the same time as this first one do this at the
same time?  Maybe the mounts have sagged and ovetime this is bound to
happen?

  Hope this info is useful to someone.

  Kyle
