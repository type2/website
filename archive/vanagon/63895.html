Subject: Alloy wheels sold...

I have sold the 6 alloy wheels I had advertised at 50 bucks each to a
listmember early this morn...
So, all ya Ohio members will have to keep the eye out for a brown '85 westy
GL (with a 2.1) toodling around to shows with a nice set of alloys in the
near future....  :&lt;)

thanks for everybody's interest..
