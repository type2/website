Subject: RE: Syncro Drivers

&gt;Does anybody drive a Syncro Wesfalia up to Tahoe or other ski area &gt;regularly? 
Not me.

&gt;Does Cal Trans let you through like a 4x4 truck when chains are &gt;required?
No idea, but why not? 

&gt;How slow are the Syncros going up up hill compared to a regular &gt;westfalia? 

Here I can be somewhat helpful.

Of the numerous mountain passes we crossed last summer with the syncro 
westie , we did Colorado's Monarch pass, a little over 11,000 feet,&quot;in 
company&quot; with a non-syncro wasserboxer westie, an '87 I think. We just 
stayed together for the ten odd miles. I had the pedal to the  metal, and 
I can't believe the other driver did otherwise. So, on dry asphalt, I 
don't believe there is a significant difference.

Now, on unplowed snow, or packed snow, or ice, no doubt the syncro
would make better time!

Maybe it worth it to just put on chains and be able to go faster?
