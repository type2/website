Subject: Good Mechanics/Shops

I would like to know of shops/mechanics that people have had good service at.
 I live in the DC Metro area and finding a good shop is next to impossible.
 I have often resorted to mail order for supplies, parts and machine work.

I'll set the example by putting the names and contact info of quality shops
that I would recommend to friends and continue to use.  I don't have any
personal gain or ties to these shops, I just have had good service and though
I would pass my recommendations along.

I have an 85 1.9l Vanagon Westy and have been very pleased with:

Olympic Imported Parts Corp
5168 Eisenhower Ave
Alexandria, VA  22304
703-370-0850
800-572-2440
Note:  Excellant prices on watercooled engine parts.  Most items in stock,
1-2 day turn around on non-stock items.  If you ask for a price break, they
will work with you.  Especially on large purchases.

Caton's Machine Shop
871 Highams Court
Woodbridge, Va  22129
703-491-2500
Note:  Phil Hall is manager.  WELL RUN shop.  They know their stuff!  They do
all types of engines.  Prices are extremely reasonable.  I have had nothing
but excellant work from them.  Never had to go back for a redo.

National Tire Wharehouse (NTW)
8195 Backlick Rd
Lorton, Va  22079
703-550-7610
Note:  A chain company, however, this particular store is run very well.
 They keep their mechanics for years at a time (a rarity in DC).  They are
well trained and have a true feeling for customer service.  Prices are
comprable to other shops in area but they will beat any price if you mention
it and then take off a '5% good customer' discount if you ask for it.  They
are extremely good about no questions asked returns and repairs on warrantied
items.  They have done excellant work on my suspension and brake systems, not
to mention quality tires.

Well, that's my contribution.  Any others?
