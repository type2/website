Subject: Gas struts for rear, '81


 Hi all:

 I was in the Auto Parts Club today and I saw that they have a large
 selection of &quot;Strong Arm&quot; gas struts.  Although the &quot;Strong Arm&quot;
 catalog indicated they make the struts for the rear door on my '81
 van, Auto Parts Club doesn't carry them.  However, they do carry the
 strut for the Vanagons for 1983 and after.

 In looking at the &quot;Strong Arm&quot; catalog, the only difference I could
 see between the strut for my van and the strut for the later vans is
 that the mounting at either end of the struts are reversed.

 Is there any reason I shouldn't buy the '83-on struts ($19.99 each)
 and mount them upside down?
