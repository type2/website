Subject: Parody Archive Update

All,

Anyone who downloaded http://www.type2_dot_com/songs/busbug.mp3 probably
noticed that the file cut off about two or three minutes into playing. This
was due to an encoder error. The file has been re-encoded. Downside: the
file size doubled (it's a long song. :) ) You will need to re-download the
file if you wish to hear the entire song.

If you find any more errors, let me know and I will re-encode the file.
Thanks!

- J
