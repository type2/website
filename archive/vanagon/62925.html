Larry, my 86 westi does the speedo thing too!, I find it worse when it gets
cold out or the van has been sitting, just recently replaces the light my
self as well, I think that I will try the lube fix with some of the stuff I
have, for some reason my wife just doesn't like to Tap the speedo face
cover to get it to run?  (can't figure out why), Vw designed it to
this......Didn't they? ;)

&gt; Hello;  I finally found the time to check out the problem with the
digital
&gt; clock constantly cycling the hours.  I took out the dash to get at the
&gt; clock, the little target-like plastic peices that you push against when
you
&gt; adjust the clock had fallen doown and got itself trapped under the
plunger
&gt; (that actuallly does the electrical work that changes the time) I just
&gt; re-aligned the little targets, and re-assembled the dash. Everything
works.
&gt; I had a little problem when I first  bought the van the speedo needle was
&gt; lazy, occasionally taking 2 or 3 kms. to bounce off the stop and get
busy.
&gt; At the time I just took the speedo light out and squirted some WD40 at
the
&gt; base of the speedo needle with the long hose that came with it, through
the
&gt; hole the light goes into.  Works great.  I mopped up the mess today when
I
&gt; had the dash out. The whole job took about an hour.    Larry Carter
