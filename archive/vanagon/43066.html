&gt;SG/CD?

These are oil perfromance grades from the American Petroleum Institute (API).

For 'S'park ignition vehicles (gasoilne engines) they grade oils with letters
like SA, SB, SC, etc.  Every so often API raises the performance requirements
for oils and uses the next letter in the alphabet.  When they do, oil makers
make oils to the new standard and auto makers specify the new oils as a
requirement and design engines with the new higher requirements in mind.
 Years ago they had SA that was replaced with SB, then SC, etc.  Each grade
improves upon the previous requirements and can safely be used in cars
specifying a previous grade.  For instance, SH can be used in any vehicle
requiring older grades like SE, SF..up to SH.  Always use the latest letter
available.

For 'C'ompression ignition vehicles (diesel engines) they grade oils in a
similar manner, but use the C grades like CC, CD, etc.
