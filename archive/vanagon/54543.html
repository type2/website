Subject: Water Cooled Vanagon Concerns

I am currently considering buying a VW passenger bus or Westi.

I have the impression that there might be some concerns about the reliability of water 
cooled Vanagons.  Specifically concerning the heads.

Are there problems with the water cooled heads, or the cooling system in general?

Does VW have a &quot;secret&quot; campaign to replace these heads without charge?

If there are issues, can they be negated through good routine maintenance?

Are there any other issues regarding these water cooled engines, or Vanagons in general over 
their air cooled counterparts?

The benefits of water cooled engines (lack of noise, heat, easy accessability to engine) are 
attractive to me.  But, I need to clarify these issues further.

Thanks.
