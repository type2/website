Subject: VW of America - MasterGuard Repair Protection

Perhaps a new conversation topic:

I've received mail from Volkswagen USA inviting me to join the above plan.
I'm still trying to sort through the &quot;information overload&quot; they provided
to figure out what they're offering vs what's not specifically said. I'd like
to know from any of you being invited, your observations.

The offer seems to summarize as:

                    Gold         Platinum
  5 yr/75,000 miles $1152        $1242
  6 yr/72,000 miles $1188        $1278
                    (single payment or 12 monthly payments)
Two years U.S. Auto Club membership is also included.

Since I already have 1 yr &amp; 20,000 miles on my Eurovan this will equate to
less. Additionally, considering the basic coverage, this equates to even less.

The main attraction seems to be that during the coverage period any SINGLE
repair that is covered will cost a maximum of $25.

The literature included a legal-sized glossy &quot;come-on&quot; loaded with small
print to describe what's covered:

GOLD (parts &amp; labor)
Engine (Gasoline, Turbo/Supercharged, Diesel), Transmission (automatic,
Standard, Differential[synchro]), Front-Wheel Drive, Rear-Wheel Drive,
Steering, Front Suspension, Brakes, Electrical, Air Conditioning, &quot;AND MORE&quot;.

PLATINUM (parts &amp; labor)
Everything in the GOLD Plan - PLUS.
&quot;Coverage is so complete, so thorough, there are just a few items NOT
covered ...&quot;
 NOT Covered:
Scheduled Maintenance services; Other Normal Maintenance services &amp; parts;
body damage, glasses, lens, beams &amp; bulbs; Rust damage; Anti-Theft
systems; Vanagon camper equipment.

Strangely the only place that mentions the vanagon in in the NOT covered
area.

This 'invite' seems to peak my interest but the skeptical side of me would
like to have a deeper examination of what's not there before I invest.

How about comments from others!!!

  Quality is no guarantee of success, to do nothing is to guarantee failure!
