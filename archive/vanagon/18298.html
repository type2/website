Subject: Re: Cold Idle (lack of)

Not sure what the problem is Jeff, but here's another clue: It's _not_ the cold 
start valve or anything in that circuit. The cold start valve, which I think is 
basically just another fuel injector in the middle of your intake manifold, 
provides extra fuel when the motor is cold.

That could explain why your motor idles better cold. Hey wait a minute, maybe 
its not shutting off and the motor's running too rich when warmed up?

Anyway, food for thought...

&gt; In the spirit of idling problems, here's mine which is a bit
&gt; different from the others currently on the list. I have an '87
&gt; Westy with 70K miles. It often stalls if the engine is cold
&gt; when I come to a stop unless I keep my foot on the gas. It 
&gt; usually has an ok idle right after starting, but if I touch the 
&gt; gas and then take my foot off it will stall. The problem seems
&gt; to be worse when it's hot outside. My theory is that whatever controls
&gt; the curb idle when the engine is still cold is not working properly.
&gt; That may be why the problem is better when it's colder out - the engine
&gt; is colder and it's easier for this mysterious part to detect a cold engine.
&gt; I know there is an idle control valve and idle stabilizer. Does either
&gt; one of these affect just cold engine idle? Is there a sensor that
&gt; is involved? I read the FAQ and replaced the coolant temperature sensor.
&gt; This didn't seem to help. In the last 5 months I've also replaced the
&gt; O2 sensor, plugs, rotor and distributor cap. Does the wiring harness
&gt; upgrade affect cold idle? How can I tell if this has been done - I'm
&gt; the third owner.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for the help!
