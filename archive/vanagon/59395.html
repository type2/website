Subject: Syncro tranny ? noise


Hi Volks,

I heard a new sound this weekend, twice, which I could not reproduce at 
will.  I was stationary, in Neutral, and there was a rumble that I could 
hear from the driver's seat.  It seemed to come from the rear, but I 
could not hear it when I went back and raised the engine cover.  I could 
make it go away by shifting into Reverse or Low (manual transmission) and 
putting too much pressure on the stick.  

Any suggestions, ideas, ruminations, ramblings, suppositions, or rumors 
are welcome.  

Cheers,

Chris Wyatt
