Well, I'll bet there are more than one &quot;illegal&quot; copy out there, owned
by members  on the list ;-). 

Now, I just might have seen such a book, and if I recall correctly it is
very interesting. Many of the parts listed are not VW parts, but full
descriptions and drawings so that you could take them to your local
machine shop and have them made up. Thats not to say they would be
cheap.

It is not syncro specific though, indeed many of the parts make sense
only for regular vanagons, bash plates for the (forward) gas tank,
things like that. Very useful, though, since it points out the places
that VW thinks the vehicles are vulnerable, and how they think it could
be corrected.

Good luck,

Tom F.
