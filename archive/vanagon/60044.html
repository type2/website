Subject: Re: Enlarged closet; melted my A/C system!

Drew -
	I never really thought about the air conditioning unit needing extra
ventilation space! I have always used the space under the rear closet for
stuffing my electric power cord, sometimes a hose, and road hazzard triangle
into. I guess this stuff doesn't really fill up the area and air can still 
circulate around it and up? I do admit that I hated to see the loss of space
the airconditioner caused. 
	My '80 had no air and I LOVED the &quot;clothes closet&quot; over the rear seat.
We could get all of our shirts, unides, and odds and ends in it nicely for a 
long trip. Now we have to use additional boxes now for these clothes! And, as
you state, there was also a loss of space in the rear closet. Too bad since 
many of us don't use the air except in unusual circmustances.
