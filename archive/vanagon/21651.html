Subject: T-shirts, anyone? 
Date: Thu, 27 Jul 95 17:01:41 EDT
From: Poor Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

I recall a while back a great deal of conversation went on about making
up list shirts. As far as I know, nothing ever came of this, which I
would like to change. If I can get about 10 people to pay $10 or so,
then I will handle the business end. Of course prices go down as more
folks order.  
  Here's what I had in mind:
 VWOA has a new promotional poster that has front views of some 50 VW's,
including all 4 generations of buses. I propose a front view of 1 of
each generation, about 5&quot;, in a square, with words above and below the
pictures. The shirt would have 3 colors, plus a black outline. Something
like this:

    NETVERGNU:GEN

     %%%    %%%

     %%%    %%%

Any thoughts on the subject?
