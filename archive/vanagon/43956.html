Subject: Can I replace a Solex 28 PICT with 30 PICT 2?

My 1961 40 hp SAE bus was converted to 12 volts by the P.O. As a result, I
have no choke. I can't seem to locate a replacement element which will fit
this carb. I tried tracking down an element used on the earlier ambulances
and firetrucks which were converted to 12 volts, but no luck.  Now I 'm
wondering if I could use a spare 30 PICT 2 I have in the cellar. This has
the correct 12 volt element, and would seem to be a solution. But is it
realistic, or will other problems surface?
I do have a spacer plate which will allow the carb to fit the manifold.
