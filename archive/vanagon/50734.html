Subject: Tires FS and New Carat in the 'hood

Taken off a 90 Vanagon Carat a friend just bought (for $6400, very
clean, heads done by VW 15K back, 124,000 total miles).

205x70x14. They were installed in November 1995, and they have lots of
tread, no wear patterns. I can't remember the brand...if it was Michelin
it would stick in my head.  

The only reason he is replacing these tires is they are not C rated or
reinforced, are rated at a max of 35PSI, and so are not really suitable
for this Vanagon. If there is no interest on the list, he will haul them
around to a used tire dealer or two and sell them. 

So let me know if you could make use of these, and I'll get you the
details and you can make a bid or prod him into setting a price. Of
course, they can be UPSs most anywhere or available for pickup in the
Washington DC area.
