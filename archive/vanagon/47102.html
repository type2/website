Subject: vanagon crew cabs

I wonder if anyone may be able to answer this one. I have seen two 
vanagon crew cabs here in southern california over a period of perhaps 8 
or 9 years. Unfortunately, both were traveling in the opposite 
direction. 
Where, how can I find out about obtaining one?
Sincerely,
Joe Schofield
