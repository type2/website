Subject: odometer quirkiness
Date: Mon, 7 Jul 1997 21:40:03 -0400

Hey all,
Well, it started yesterday.  My odometer is getting weird.

The situation:

Driving to Knoxville TN from Johnson City TN I notice that the trip
odometer has been on 9.9 miles an awfully darn long time.  I notice that
the odometer is not advancing but the speedometer is working fine.

At a rest stop, I push the reset button on the trip odometer.  The trip and
regular odometers now work fine.

Sometime on the way back, it stops working again.  I reset it this morning
when I noticed it had stopped and it starts working again.  Then it stopped
again, and then I reset it again and now it's working.

There is no noise being made by the odometer.  The speedometer works fine. 


There is no real rhyme or reason to when the odometer cuts out.  Once it
stopped at 9.9 miles, once it stopped at 190 miles, once it stopped at .7
miles.

Any ideas?  Is this possibly related to the oh-so-common plastic drive gear
cracking problem?  It looks like my time has come.  

I will eventually pull it apart (when I get some free time, could be a few
weeks...) but I'd love to hear any ideas in the meantime.

thanks,
Sean
