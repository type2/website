Subject: Re: Needed Parts..

&gt;&gt;I  I also may need to find some used heater boxes.  If anyone in the DC
&gt;&gt;area has these parts, please let me know!

I would recommend you pick up a copy of the Want Ad, a small publication
available in 7-Elevens, Giant Food, etc. There are usually Bus parts to be
had in there. There is one guy from Annapolis that seems to always be
selling something.

&gt;&gt; I don't know how important these heat exchangers are to the vital
&gt;&gt;functions of my bus, but I was told I may not pass Maryland inspection
&gt;&gt;with the amount of rust damage they have
&gt;&gt;incurred.

MD inspection can be a royal pain to get through. Many shops see it as an
opportunity to make some cash. If you need the name of an honest inspection
facility in Montgomery County, contact me. The worry with rusted out heat
exchangers is that exhaust fumes from the engine will get piped into the
passenger compartment.
