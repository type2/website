Subject: Re: What has happened to gasoline prices?

I've also heard that it's because of reformulated gasoline in CA - but I
heard that stuff kicked in at the end of March which would be well timed with
the increases.

I also had some problems after running Beacon gas (which was also an
emergency for me - small town, gauge on E and only one place open).  I'll
really try not to use that again

As for the price of gasoline - we are pretty spoiled in this country (read
the one from Switzerland).  The true costs of the stuff have remained well
hidden in the U.S.
