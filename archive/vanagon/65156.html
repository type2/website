Subject:      1997 &lt;Mexican&gt; Beetle FS &lt;Arizona/Utah&gt;

AZ Republic newspaper, Sunday, Sept 7,1997:

'97 Bug, Fuel injected, catalytic converter, undercoated, white, 4spd,
$13,000. &lt;602&gt;545-7736.

The lady mentioned that it belongs to her parents who have a home in Utah,
New Mexico, and Mexico. They wanted an economical ride while down south.
They simply drove it across and titled in either UT or NM... They also
forgot to mention that its a convertible! Triple white.

Hmmmm,  I don't have the cash or interest. Go get it and beware of potential
emissions/insurance problems in your home State/Province. I do not have any
other details.
