Subject: Fwd: Gas tank leak-'TOP LEAK' may be &quot;Y&quot; fitting to expansion tanks

-- [ From:  * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

My first guess on the matter of leak on the 84: At 14 years in service,
it's about time for the plastic in the fuel system in your VW to fail.
Check the notorious &quot;Y&quot; fittings on top of the gas tank.  They connect the
expansion tank(s), one on each side,  to the gas tank.  You can feel them
through the wheel wells on each side of the vehicle.  Turn the wheels to
the left and reach up, above the tire on the passenger side, and feel for
the expansion tank.  Then feel for a pipe which which is connected to the
gas tank.  A plastic pipe traverses the top of the gas tank between the two
expansion tanks.  It connects on each of the vehicle into grometted
orifices in the top of the gas tank.  The &quot;Y's&quot; are pressure fitted into
the traversing pipe.  If one is broken, your VW dealer will sell you one
for about $32.00, including grommets. To install, there is no need to drop
the tank, a heavy, dirty, akward job which requires draining the tank, and
all that implies.

At some point, check the driver side arrangement for the same leak
potential.

I've installed the &quot;Y&quot; fitting on my 84 by dropping the spare tire tray,
removing the pin which supports it, removing the tray from the work area,
and finessing the grommets and the &quot;Y's&quot; into the appropriate orifices.  

Dirty shirt, strong hands, patience and lubricating the grommets go a long
way to finishing the job. Optimum situation is to have access to lift. 
Otherwise,  jack stand the vehicle, let the wheels hang and reach up to
install.  Caution, loosen the negative ground on the battery (gasoline,
fire, safety, etc.,,,,), wipe off the dirty top of the gas tank, NB, note
well, FIRST fit the &quot;Y&quot; in to the grommet, and THEN install the grommeted
fitting using a bit of graphite to  ease the bind.  That technique will
prevent first installing the grommet into the tank orifice and then using
the &quot;Y&quot; to force the grommet into the tank.

Second guess:  The collar at the filling pipe into the tank.  I've no
experience in that quarter.

Let us know your experience.

Subject: Gas tank leak

Well, I think my tank has sprung a leak.
I filled my 84 up with gas on saturday night, went and paid the bill and 
when I walked back to the van, gas is dripping from the tank. I looked
underneath and gas was dripping from the back end of the tank,  in the
middle.  I looked like the gas was dripping down from the top of  the tank
as well.

Guesses on the source?  I was sure it was a leak on the top of the tank, 
until I read the archives and guess it could also be a hose fitting on the 
top of the tank.

What to do?  I suppose the thing to do is wait till the tank is near  empty
and take the tank off and take a look.  Is this a big enough pain  that I
will want to have spare gaskets to put on when I take the tank off?

If the tank has a hole, has anyone had the tank succesfully patched by 
welding?  How much should I expect to pay for a new/used tank?

Thanks in advance

Blake
