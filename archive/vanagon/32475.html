&gt; Hello all,
&gt; What are recommended spares to carry around that are vw specific.  My 87 
&gt; syncro is pushing 135kmi and I'd like to put together an emergency kit so's 
&gt; my chances of being stranded are reduced.  some ideas i've had (with the 
&gt; help of previous browsing of the list) are:
&gt; 
&gt; starter relay (what other relays or electrical components should be incl.)
&gt; a section of coolant hose and some couplings
&gt; belts
&gt; coolant
&gt; ????

Just get a tow bar and find another van like yours and tow it behind you. ;)
