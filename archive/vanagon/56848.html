Kelly -

Naw, just need to take the wheel off, take the drum off and lube the 
parking brake cable and places where it makes contact with the 
backing  plate and any other place where friction anc take hold. 
A little rust in or on those surfaces will make the 
parking brake difficult to use.  Use grease sparingly inside the 
brake drum area and don't get any on the brake shoes.  Chance to 
check out the condition of the brakes too.

Water in there, freezing could also cause this condition.

&gt; Can anyone suggest any preventative maintainance for this affliction?
&gt; Please, please don't tell me this is the warning sign for a major problem.
