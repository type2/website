Subject: Re: Need Price info on Clean '83 Westie with 76K Miles
Date: Thu, 10 Jul 1997 12:43:14 -0400


&gt; I've got a friend who wants &quot;in&quot; to the Westie game and has been
&gt; scouting for a while. He spotted an '83 with 76K miles, good shape,
&gt; summer car, no rust (repainted), fridge, stove, aux heater. The PO
&gt; claims no problems. He is asking $7900.
&gt; 
&gt; Price sources that I have consulted only go back to '87. Anybody have 
&gt; any info on a fair price for this vehicle? Anyone bought or sold one
&gt; around that year recently?


In my experience, this price is quite high.  At least here in the Philly
area, a very clean (but not mint) '83 water-cooled Westy would be worth
maybe $5000, perhaps less.
