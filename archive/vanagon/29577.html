Subject:      for the Eurovan folks ... and Wana-EVs

those of you wondering what (if any) facial changes might be made in the
1996 EV, be sure to check out the photos in the January issue of ...
you guessed it! VW TRENDS. :)

and if anyone is considering a VW/Winnebago Rialta, there is one for sale
at Burton's Campers in Calera, Alabama (about 30 miles south of Birmingham,
on I-65). i don't know the asking price or the year, but if anyone is
interested, i can find their phone number.
