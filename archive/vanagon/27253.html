&gt; Hi John !
&gt;   could that gadget be the mechanical fuel pump ? It usually has 3 hoses
&gt; attached to it: one from the tank, one to the carbs and one short piece
&gt; called the &quot;vent tube&quot; that goes nowhere inparticular. maybe it was
&gt; disconnected because it was replaced by an electrical fuel pump ? if you
&gt; have the electric pump you should
&gt; be able to hear a clicking noise when you turn your ignition key
&gt;   about question 2: i'm sure joel will be more than happy to  fill you in
&gt; on that one...
&gt;     breadloafs forever !

Since you have an electric pump, you should then ask yourself, Why?
The answer is probably because the original engine was replaced with
one from another Type IV vehicle e.g. the 412.  This was done with
the '74 I had and the electric pump drove me nuts!  The timing for
that engine is also different.  You can verify what engine you have
by taking down the engine number and looking up that engine number
in the Bently/Haynes or whatever you have manual.
