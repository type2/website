&gt; Hello,
&gt;         I'm new to this list, just wanted to introduce myself and my newly
&gt; acquired 77 Westfalia (Kodak yellow/orange) named Petey...

Welcome!  And good colour!

&gt;         The 12V Sink pump and switch are completely shot, need new ones.
&gt; Any suggestions as to where to locate these items or suitable replacements?

This is the non-city water 12V pump I take it?  If it's the one that 
draws water only from the water tank, go to an RV dealer for both the 
pump and the switch--VW's prices (at least here in Canada) are criminal.
I paid $14.95 for the faucet with switch, and $19.95 for a 1 gpm pump.  
Replacement is straight-forward, only you'll have to lie on your back 
with your feet hanging out the sliding door to re/re the pump.
