Hello,

There may be only one or ... ?

About 5 years ago, there was one parked at a auto repair place a few blocks 
from my home in Phoenix AZ for several weeks.  Last summer I saw what I 
thought was the same bus parked along the road near Payson (northern AZ). 
 I have never seen it (them?) running.

Mike
