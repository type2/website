Subject: Propane Regulator Questions

I filled my propane for the first time last night and the regulator leaked out
gaseous propane every time I opened the valve.  I think the valve closes if I
really crank on it.  Is there any maintenance I can perform, or can I replace
the regulator?  Anyone have a good source for regulators that I could get
before July 18th?  
It looks like there MIGHT be a piece missing, but having never looked at one
before, I'd like confirmation:
  The regulator looks something like this:

         |                    |   |                    |
         |                    | O |                    |
         +---------------------------------------------+
Is there supposed to be
something in the two screw holes depicted by ``O'' ? And in the channel
between them?  The gas is leaking out the spot marked by the ``x''


Thanks for any advice on this.
