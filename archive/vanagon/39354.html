Subject: Backup halogens


I'm interested in mounting the spare &quot;tractor&quot; light as a back-up light,
and I liked the idea posted earlier about connecting it to a switch
on the dash.  At the risk of asking a stupid question, what's the 
best way to run the wiring from the rear bumper to the dashboard?  Is
there a channel through the body of the bus?  How do you pull wires 
through it?
