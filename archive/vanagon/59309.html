David,

Does yours have a vacuum controlled fuel pressure regulator?  It could be
that the diaphragm leaks fuel into the intake manifold through the
attached vacuum line.

&gt; I know that this thread is probably gone far enough, but I still don't
&gt; seem to be able to isolate the problem completely.  Here's a recap to
&gt; date:
&gt; 
&gt; a couple of weeks ago when I was driving home from work, the engine on
&gt; my 82 westy suddenly started running very rough, smoking and would die
&gt; if I took my foot off the gas.  I checked my temp sensors, no problem
&gt; there. I checked all the fuel injector connections, everything seems to
&gt; be OK there also.  I cleaned the inside of the AFM and the butterfly
&gt; valve seems to be moving freely. No O2 sensor is part of the system,
&gt; apparently not part of the 82 aircooled system.  Gas still seems to be
&gt; getting into the oil.  OK, here's the wierd part...  When the key is on,
&gt; I can hear and feel gas running through the fuel lines, apparently going
&gt; into the pistons.  When I disconnect the AFM, the fuel stops running. 
&gt; It will idle fine with the AFM disconnected, but of course will not
&gt; drive that way.  I have pretty much decided that the AFM is bad (has an
&gt; intermittant problem, since it only does it after driving a while 5-10
&gt; minutes) and I need to replace it.  Does anyone have any experience with
&gt; this?  Do you think I'm on the right track?  Thanks!
