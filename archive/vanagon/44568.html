&gt;So Scott A. Harvey says:
with no drips, then they're probably okay.  If they are dripping and not
&gt;a good spray then you should get the fuel-injectors cleaned.  Any good
&gt;shop should be able to do this.  Or you can try pouring one of the off-
&gt;the-shelf fuel-injector cleaner brands into your tank and see if this
&gt;alleviates the problem.

I would recommend Chevron Techron for this.  Works very well.  Available
for about $8US at your FLAPS.

Eric
