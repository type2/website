Subject: Sighting: VW powered Jeep CJ-5

Strange sighting on Saturday. I stopped by the local VW flaps and noticed a
normal conservative looking Jeep CJ5 &lt;or older-Im not up on Jeeps&gt; parked
behind the store. The parking lot is situated so that it is nearly mandatory
to go to the rear of the store and pull a U-turn and come back out the same
way you came in.
As I passed the Jeep I noticed the owner standing at the rear of it looking
down. I literally did a double take as I noticed a clean looking 1600 T1
style motor positioned in the usual spot &lt;for a vw&gt;. The man just smiled as
I drove by. I had no time to stop and inspect. Weird but cool! =)

With the rear &quot;lid&quot; down, I never would have thought any thing about the
vehicle as it looked perfectly normal for a Jeep.
