&gt; thom, there are also two types of the earlier aprons.  one is just like 
&gt; you described and the other has a slotted hole in the notch for a hand 
&gt; crank starter handle.  i think that goes up to around 1958 but not sure.

Hmmm.  Forgot about that.    Thats what mine has.

The crank setup is actually 4 parts:

The crank
The Apron
The engine tin with a spring loaded window for the crank
A special pulley nut to recieve the crank
