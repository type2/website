&gt;  &gt; I've used a 6-point metric allen wrench with no problems (I think it was
&gt;  &gt; 6mm but it could have been 7mm). You can buy the whole set of metric
&gt;  &gt; allens for under $10 or pay $12 for the one 12-point tool (and I'm only
&gt;  &gt; quoting a price I heard..I don't know of a source). 
&gt;  
&gt; Oh, dear, no.  I've never had the allen wrenches work, adn the K-D tool you 
&gt; can get at FLAPS is, well, I ruined three of them.
 
&gt; ...Berry continues, singing praises of Snap-On tool.

Just so I might get in the last word (ahem...yeah, right), let me 
emphasize that I used the CORRECT (read snug-fitting) METRIC allen wrench 
and had no problem. Of course, maybe my technique is a little better 
than Berry's...or maybe the fact that the 12-point screw heads weren't 
jammed on with guerilla force has something to do with it. If you do try 
the allen wrench, make sure it fits tight...and give up and go get 
Berry's 12-point, gold filled Snap-On right BEFORE the head strips, as I 
can only imagine how much fun that would be AFTER the head strips. (Now 
donning SnapOn Asbestos diaper ;) Joe
