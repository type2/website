Subject: gas heater FS (jeff schneiter)


Jeff asked me to post this to the list:

--

FS: BN4 aux. gas heater; ext. oil cooler

Time to clear out my backyard and some lucky sole will
end up with the goods...

My old '72 had the BN4 heater in it, but I never got the
chance to test it out. I am not sure what they are going
for, but I heard that $100 is reasonable...but I will go
for best offer. The deal is, I would like to find out if
it is working before selling, to make sure that the buyer
gets a good product. If you know how to test these things
and would like to earn a couple bucks, or if you are
interested in buying it and can test it out, you will get
a discount. Since it is so heavy, I will probably sell it
in the Bay Area, don't want to deal with shipping...will
consider all offers tho.

The oil cooler is an EMPI, still in its shrinkwrap. Not
sure what model, it said something about sand on the package,
and someone once mentioned that it is worth a good price. It
would be easier to ship than the heater. Accepting offers.
