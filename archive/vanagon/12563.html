&gt;        4) List folks, can Marcus's friend check the torque on the
&gt;nuts holding the case halves together? - ie put a wrench on it and
&gt;take the wrench up to the stated figure and see if the nut moves,
&gt;or if the wrench sets at that torque (or clicks if a click-type)?

No.  Remove the engine and check for leaks.  Retorque the case-halves, but...
