Subject: SPAM and other electronic crap


Be forewarned....
I am subscribed to Vanagon, APO-L, APOSOC-L.  On the last two lists (They
are run by memmbers of my Fraternity) have been getting some heavy SPAM
lately.  
My experience with this problem has led me to advise all:  Don't reply,
the SPAMer is gone already.  You will receive an error message further
clogging up your quotas. 
The main reson I am doing this now is that I have received approx. 87
messages that are bounced and rebounced and repeated.  Then people started
to respond/reply which only compounded the problem.

Don't respond to the SPAMs.  Let Joel handle it, please.  Save our
bandwidth for something more important-Like FFFFriday Follies!

My 2 phennings worth.
