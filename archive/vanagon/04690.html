&gt;  If the reverse gear selector rod has broken off, find another tranny.  

Just in case anyone is interested, I have a tranny taken from a running
'74 bus (I should mention that the bus wasn't running while I took out
the tranny, as is the tradition on this list).

I'd like to get $75 for it, and you would have to pick it up in San Diego
or participate in the Brick tour to get it.  :)
