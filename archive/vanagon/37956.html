&gt; one although the drive is a bit long.  When's the date again Jason?

Again my apologies. I guess I'm really bailing on this organization 
thing. It seems to me you already figured it out that it's going to be 
this Friday.
If it seems that my reply came at a spped similar to that of the U.S. 
Postal Service it was because I went out of town this past weekend for a 
friend's wedding. Beautiful wedding at that.
'nuff of my ranting and raving....
