Subject: super beetle alignment

Your alignment is simple:camber and toe. As long as your camber adjustment
bolts(with the eccentrics) are free, the bushings are ok, and the tie rods
are free and the ends are good, any one trained in front end alignment
should be able to do the job. The &quot;VW's are weird&quot; thing sounds like an old
cop-out similar to &quot;I can't do it, I don't have metric tools!&quot;. I'd suggest
you take your car to Firestone, or any big tire dealer. They all should
have very good alignment machines. It's a fine-tuned computerized art
nowadays. The new Hunter machine we have where I work is nothing but and
IBM clone 486 with a 7-disc CD-Rom with the appropriate software
installed(plenty of room for silly games,etc),with laser pickups for the
wheels. We charge something like $79.95 for an alignment on a
Mercedes-Benz,which has camber,caster and toe,as well as rear axle
adjustments.

Good Luck,

yug
