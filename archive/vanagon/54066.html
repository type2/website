Subject: Re: RE: Re(2): Rubber Floor Mats for Vanagon

Chris,

I called Parts Place and they are sending a catalog to me.  Are yours rubber?  I
had heard they were plastic.  The salesman said $38.00 for the pair.  I guess
I'll have to cut the driver's side and live with the exposed edge.  Should
protect the carpet, though.  No chance of finding the original VW type, except
in salvage yards.  I found a dealer who said he had had several NOS sets in the
back, and then someone put it on the Internet and he sold them all within a
week.   Thanks for the help though.

Charles
