Question...
My wing window on the drivers side of my 85 Vanagon is not tight
anymore, any wind resistance against it and it shuts itself. Do any of
you know of a fix for this? (Couldn't find much about it in the
Bentley)


In The Service Manual For My 73 Says That Under The Bottom Hinge (Behind   
The Vinyl) There Is A Bolt To Tighten.  Might Be A Place To Start.
(Hmm Maybe I Could Finally Tighten Mine Too...)
