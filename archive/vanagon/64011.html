Subject: starter problems

Hi All,

Well, sort of a crazy story... I went to Sears (Phoenix) to get some extra
ignition keys for my '85 Westi.  They said that the template didn't match,
but that it was compatible, so I had them make a few keys.  We left for
Flagstaff, my wife was driving.  About 1/2 way we pull off at a rest stop
where it felt like 120 deg. out, but when we go to leave the car won't
start. Upon inspection and playing with the key, I realize that the key
doesn't spring back from the starter engaged position and hypothosize that
we had driven from Phoenix with the starter engaged.  I realize that this
sounds impossible because of the expected racket this would make, however
I was in the back seat with my daughter watching a movie on our 9&quot; tv with
headphones on and the A/C on full blast.  My wife doesn't drive the VW
very often, so I think she may not have noticed the noise over the A/C
either.

I've got the Bentley Bible, so follow the steps to problem solve beyond
the battery - it's fine.  What-the-heck, tried to jump it anyway ...
no-go.  So we push start it and it starts right up, but with a brief
clatter (from the starter I imagine?).  

I'm feel fairly certain the starter is trashed, so I'm wondering...

1.)  Should I just get a new one and replace it...

2.)  If I do, how hard is this?

3.)  And is it possible if we drove that far with the starter engaged that
little metal shavings got in the engine?

4.)  Do the selenoids usually need to be replaced w/the starter?


We made it back to Alb. by push starting it everywhere (felt soft of like
the Beverly Hillbilly's) and it seemed to run fine.

Thanks,
Ivan ('85 Westi)

p.s., Thanks to all for your many ideas on care and prep for our trip...
