Subject: drinking song

I thought it would be nice for us to have a Netters-Volkswagen-owners'
drinking song.  So far I have three verses, and it has completely worn
me out making these, so maybe someone else will pitch in and add some.
In particular, add a verse featuring yourself.

As you read this, try to imagine some kind of tune, simple though it
may be.


And how about Willy,
Who calls himself Villy,
He's rilly quite silly,
I'd say--

And when the day's done,
Willy's having some fun,
Racing and chasing in
Willy's Fow Vay.


And how about Martha,
her car that goes farther
on ethanol--Or the
Volks say...

And when the day's done,
Martha's having some fun,
Racing and chasing in
Martha's Fow Vay.


And how about Joel,
who surely does know'll-
ot--when he's done typing, so'll
we, eh?

And when the day's done,
Joel's having some fun,
Racing and chasing in
Joel's Fow Vay.
