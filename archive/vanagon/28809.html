Subject: Trip to Orlando,Fl

All,

I am going to be driving the Westy to Orlando, Fl this weekend, from Austin,Tx.
If I break down, it sure would be nice to be able to get in touch with someone
in the approximate area for help, advice on garages, salvage yards, and such.
I will be travelling I-10 until someother interstate in Fla(can't remember the
number), and then, unless I find a shorter way, get on the Fla. Turnpike? to
Orlando.

If any of you kind souls live along this proposed route, would volunteer your
name and phone #, I would be extremely grateful, and if your services are
required, I will of course treat to beer, and pizza, or some such reward.

Unless you want tons of calls from wierdo VW types, e-mail me direct.
(Though some say I am sort of wierd :-))

TIA
David
