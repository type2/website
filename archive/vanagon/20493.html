Subject: bug screen for door
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 95 7:36:26 EDT

Here is a simple idea that someone on the list may have already thought of.

Martha was asking about how to improve ventilation in the Westy.

Take a flexible &quot;plastic&quot; mesh bug screen designed for a door. Cut enough
to fill the sliding door entrance and then another 2 inches all around.
Sew  (or glue) magnets in each of the four corners of the screen and then 
some more along the top and bottom. 

Result: instant bug screen for door when open, or partially open. Folds
when not in use. The magnets
should be sufficiently strong to keep the door partially open. Someone
mentioned velcro. This may also work.

One downside though, the risk of being dragged away by wild dogs in the
night increases, the wider the opening.
