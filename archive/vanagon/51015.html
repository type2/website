Subject:      Re: Conti Tires for '93 EV


Recently two of my OEM Conti's on the '93 MV we have turned up with broken
belts in the tread. I phoned Conti's 800 number (found under General TIre
in 800 information) and complained mildly and they replacedthem free of
charge with no treadwear considerations (Other than that there had to be
at least 2/32&quot; left). They claimed that these tires had a 4-year/48,000
warrantly against all manufacturing defects and road hazards. I've found
these tires to be good and reliable, but not particularly outstanding.
The originals were CS-21's; they have now been replaced by CT-22's. My
new ones handle better than the old ones, have a somewhat softer ride,
and are rated 240 A A (treadwear, traction, temperature). The CS 21's
were 200 A B. My tires had 35K miles when replaced.

Continental was VERY accomodating about all this.
