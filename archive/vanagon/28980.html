Subject: Re: Westphalia Top Speed

&gt;
&gt;     Does anyone want to share information on their Westphalias' top speed? by
&gt;     engine size and trans configuration?

  The &quot;Car and Driver&quot; review of the original Wasserboxer '86 Vanagon
Synchro Westfalia lists its top speed at 79mph.  Sure.
   I have not had my '87 Westy SynchroGL a long time(month and a half), but
I have put many a highway mile on it (getting to 7000,) always  checking
its performance.   Now you may have heard that my van has had more than its
share of problems (check recent posting by me.)  However, when my van was
running well I can attest to a average top cruising speed of _around_ 76mph
on level ground with plenty of time and NO WIND.
    As you no doubt know, the wind is the true deciding factor of a
Westfalia's top speed.  A light headwind can knock you down 10mph easy, and
vice versa.  A broadside wind can damn near blow you off a bridge into the
Hood River on the Oregon-Washington border.
    Also I must point out that my  tires are size 195s, and the factory
specified Syncro tire size 210s.
  You may also be interested to know that the previously reported 76mph is
no longer my top speed.  I had the &quot;factory set&quot; air screw modified about a
quarter turn (you have to drill out the plug.)  Now I have more power and
even better gas milage!  I haven't determined the exact top speed yet,
because I have to drive across some flat state like Iowa to get an accurate
figure.  My new top end though is over eighty and probably around 85mph or
more!  8-)

Hope I helped,
                        Hal Jones (joneskp_at_ctrvax.vanderbilt_dot_edu)
