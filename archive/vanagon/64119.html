&gt; Take my advice,
&gt; forget the 12 volt, stick to the gas, works much better...

Bob,
How many days will the fridge run on one tank of propane, I will be
doing the Baja run myself soon and running that thing for better than a
week straight or better. I knew the propane would be much better, but I
don't know (and must know) how long I can expect cold groceries on a
continuous run with the Dometic on propane max cold mode?
