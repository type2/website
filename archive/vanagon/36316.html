dang it!! i just read the original post that was out of order in my  
mail and i didn't realize the problem was while it was being driven 
for an hour or so.

does your van do this:   ?
drive for a period, then jerk like crazy as if the engine is cutting 
in and out.  maybe idles rough or smooth when you stop.  shut down a 
while, then start up.  may be rough or problem may be gone.  drives 
fine sometimes.  

mine DID do the above and it was a dirty air flow meter.  cleaned the 
contacts and problem was solved.

or you might be a ghost harness candidate.
