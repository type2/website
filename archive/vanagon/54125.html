Subject: Skylight Solution

Well I finally fixed my cracked skylight lens. I had too, some monster
type of blower fan at the carwash ripped the thing off into oblivion. It
was pretty scary, it seemed like the end of the world. My dog went nuts.
We had a good time!
	Anyway, I used a piece of 1/2 in. pexi-glass with some motifications to
make it work. It looks good and it doesn't leak. Have'nt checked for
noise at highway speeds yet, but I have a solution if it's a problem.
Since I don't have the lens effect, I won't get large amounts of light,
but I don't like light anyway. It will get enough light on it's own.
Plus replacement lenses are $140 and purely junk. This one will never
break. 
	If any other listmembers need more info for this installation, let me
know. It is kind of tricky to set this up with a flat piece of glass
rather than a curved lens, but I still have my template. Or.... maybe I
can sell these over the net and quit my job and... get rich and...
