Subject: 80's transporters

 
	Hello fellow vaners, 
	Been a while since last I wrote to this list (it's the only one I 
know of), but I just saw something of interest today.  
	I know that Europe has the later model transporters so I thought 
I probably would not soon see one, however, I caught a glimps of a dusty 
blue 84-86 (?) transporter with an ill fitting canopy.  It almost looked 
like the super cab of American trucks but without the four doors.  I did 
not see the front end so I'm not sure if it was air or water so it may 
even be an earlier one.  Does any one know of this vanagon?  I saw it in 
Santa Cruz CA. 
	Were these ever sold in the U.S. or Canada, or Mexico? 
	
	One quick question, does anyone know of a BMW (it's German too!) 
list, esp. for the older ones?
	You can send to me directly, thanks ...walt...
