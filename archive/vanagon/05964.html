Subject:      solar panels vs generators vs camping vs kids

well, if we REALLY wanted to go camping, we'd leave the buses at the
road and hike up into the Great Wilderness, carrying everything on our backs,
and really rough it! uh-uh-uh!! no matches, folks! :)

but then we'd be right back in the boy scouts ... and, while it was a Grande
Adventure to do these things as a youngster, my decrepit old bones do like
a comfortable place to sleep, and warm food (that doesn't taste like it was
dropped continuously into the ashes of a pine-straw fire).

so we all 'compromise' in our own ways ... if we were compromising, we wouldn't
be driving vw buses. :)`

i still there there ought to be some tiny little generator that would fit in
the back fender corner and put out enough juice to power a westafilia for a
whole day on a half-gallon of gas.  somewhere, there's got to be one!

and with the use of a few solar panels, you could stay out until the food was
gone.  or the kids ran you crazy.
