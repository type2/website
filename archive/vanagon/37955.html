Subject: Noise Control Weatherstripping

I just got a set of the rubber inserts that came in the late model Vanagons to
fill the gap in the doors to reduce wind noise (I have an '86). Has anyone tried
to install these? Do you have to take the doors off? I'm having a hard time
getting the inserts positioned properly. If you do have to remove the doors is
there a recommended procedure for taking them off and getting them back on?
