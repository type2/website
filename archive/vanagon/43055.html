Subject: Good Bye :(

 Well folks, what a long strange trip it's been indeed. I first hopped on this
list back in it's infancy, in the summer of '94. Since then, I have watched it
grow, and seen many new names and personalities emerge, as well as seen a lot
of the old faithful still around. I really appreciate our family, even as it
continues to grow.
 However, it seems that I may lose my account here, if I can't keep my job
after my summer's travels. I am leaving from Busses on the Blue Ridge Parkway
with 5 of my friends in 2 busses to traipse about the countryside. Despite
putting in a request for a leave of absence in February, I was informed LAST
WEEK that I might not be able to come back. I have made too many plans at this
point to turn back, so I may be bidding my job, along with my internet access,
farewell. I know I'll be back online sometime, but who knows when that may be.
  I want to thank everyone for all the wonderful times here. Thanks to everyone
who bought my shirts and stickers. (The last batch will be in the mail
tomorrow; I'm picking them up today). Thanks to those who have hooked me up
with parts, wiring diagrams, and many answers. Thanks to all who volunteered to
put us up for the night if we're in the area. We'll be making our pilgrimage to
Allybamma to see uncle Joel, and receive some words of wisdom before we head
out west.
  Anyway, I have had a great time, and I thank everyone. I'll be back sometime,
and I hope everyone is still around, and happily bussing along!
May the four winds blow you safely home,
Poor Richard
