Rusty VanB sez:
I suspect that some flattened Vanagon owner will be contacting the U.S.
government (US DOD) via his/her lawyer. I think I have already involuntarily
been selected (so have you) to pay for the bus. I would cry only if the bus
was '67 or older or had an antique Martin guitar inside of it when the tank
rolled over it. Possibly my attitude would not be as harsh if it were my
Vangon. Heck, I just bought a flue cover for the thing!;)
..........................................................................

&gt;	Ok- I'm up for a collection for the former owner of that Vanagon,
&gt;call it a random act of kindness or a senseless act of mercy. Someone
&gt;can take the collection and pass it on or whatever. Let me know.
&gt;
&gt;	And Steve, yeah, insurance will pay for some of it, but heck,
&gt;why not do something nice for someone?
&gt;
&gt;	One of my great cheap pleasures in the Bay area is paying for
&gt;the person crossing the toll bridge behind me. Costs $1 everywhere except
&gt;the Golden Gate, and I figure, no-one is having *so* good a day that
&gt;having someone else pay their bridge toll doesn't make it better! If I have
&gt;one or more passengers, they can enjoy the body language of the 
&gt;recipient too. :-)
&gt;
&gt;	Course, I don't hang around to exchange waves or whatever-
&gt;that might be mis-interpreted as creepy.
&gt;
&gt;	Of course the best people to do this for are families on
&gt;long trips- I always look for a car with a couple adults and some
&gt;kids, especially if it has out of state plates. Wouldn't it brighten
&gt;your day, after 400 miles of family driving, to have someone else
&gt;pick up the brige toll? I haven't yet had it done for me, but I'm
&gt;not counting on that.
