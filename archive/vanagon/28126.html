Subject: Long ..Re:Help Me Before I Spend a Fortune &quot;on an EV&quot; 

Hello Dan,

In response...

&gt;So, before I pony up Cdn $45,000 (which I don't have),
&gt;can V_at_L members advise me?  Is the 5-cylinder reliable?
&gt;Is the front-engine design sorted out yet?  Is the
&gt;4-speed automatic any good?  Is the paint better?
&gt;Should I see my bank manager?


 Just bought my 95 EV Camper in march. So far I am happy with it. This being my
first new car. I have otherwise spent much time in many late model
Westy's. I must say that you are correct that the longer wheel base EV camper
has much more room than the late 80's and 90's Westies. One thing I suggest if
you are buying the EV is to buy it from a local dealership not one far a way.
It appears that no matter where you are, you should not pay more than $31.5K
for a totally loaded EV-Camper. I bought the 95 EV Camper package with
automatic trans, LP furnace, awning, screen package, AC, power windows. I have
had to take the van back for some warranty work. That work included a failed
front drivers side power window actuator, Blown inline fuse for the fridge,
wheel alignment for a vibration in the left rear, and the propane gas alarm had
a short. That was the bad news. Otherwise I am in love with all of the van's
features. It is a home away from home. So far at two weddings and several
family outings with children it has saved the day as a nursery/play pen and
bedroom. It's a party on
wheels (only when I'm in it ofcourse).

Performance
  It is geared well for start and stop slow traffic and highway traffic. The
five cylinder engine is strong enough. The car has lots of pep on the highway,
cruzing easily between 55 and 80 mph. I have taken mine to a 100 mph with no
problem(just below red line). The cruze crontrol is very nice for long drives
and keeping my lead foot under control. The gas milage is ok. I figure it gets
16~18 city and 20 highway. At 13K miles it has performed well in the engine
department. If you don't like to sit in traffice and shift from first to second
gear every mintue the automatic is the way to go. The transmission is as good
as you would expect. It works fine to me. The only quirky thing that I can
mention is that it is not overly ready to kick down to a lower gear to keep
your power up. I often find my self having to letoff of the gas pedal then
re-apply the gas. It is then quick to down shift and power gear restored. Again
this is not a problem just a personal observation/preference.

Comforts
  It has many. The swivel seats are great, just watch that they don't scratch
the plastic doors and safty break leaver when swiveling. The fold out tables
are aswsome. You can seat 4 and have a family dinner in the van. The beds are
comfortable and easy to use. The pop top is awsome. It is much better than the
westy fold out support bars. They are now struts that lift the poptop up once
you unlatch it and give a small push up. There are 3 screen windows on the pop
top canvas for exellent venilation. I suggest you get the new extra screen
package for the doors and windows. If you camp you'll want them to keep the
mosquitos and black flies out. The fridge, though, tempermental about being
level is big and cold. I also got the lp furnace. It is so nice to wake up
toastie warm on a cold spring or fall morning while camping. Since I havn't
camped in the winter yet it appears to be well suited for cold weather. The
sink is nice but I might have asked for slightly larger pipes for the drain.
Otherwise it is the coolest to be able to clean up after a meal or wash your
messes as you make them.

Service
 My VW dealership is a very nice one. That is key. One thing to make sure of
is that you see EVERYTHING work before you take your van home. Especially the
furnace and fridge. They are the propane options with the van. Ask to have
the dealership fill the tank then have them show you how they work. I had a bit
of a scare getting the fridge and furnace started. The propane lines and
equipment must be primed. What does that mean... it just took me 5 or 6 tries
to get each of them working. I unfortunatly ran back to the dealership after
the
fourth try and was embarrased to see it light up on their first try. They
then explained that the equipment just needed to be primed as any lp gas
equipment do. Duh?

Front wheel drive

I would think that the front end design is figured out since it is the 3rd
year that they have had the front wheel design. Ofcourse I really wanted
the 4wd when I was shopping but, hey, the syncro is my next toy. I would
think that the safty of the van has increased with the front end engine
design since there is now a engine in front of you if you have a head on
collision. The salesman also mentioned that it faired very well in the
head on crash tests. I have not documentation to support that. Someone?
I think that it's pretty neat that the radiator in the front end of the van
flips out to provide exelent access to the engine to do the plugs and
regular maintenance. I rather like the clearly marked engine parts such
as air filter, washer fluid, oil fill, oil check, antifreeeze. More than
that I'll pay someone to deal.

The small stuff
 There are some small issues that may or may not intrest you about my likes and
dislikes about the van. I like the tinted windows in the cabin compartment.
I don't like small openings affored by the windows. It would be nice to have
AIR FLOW in the van, espcially on a hot summer day. the two cabin windows
are less than 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the entire window. Yuk. In my opinion
the windows should be huge and let lots of air in. You'll know what I mean.
Also the levlor blinds that you get with the van are very nice for keeping
out the sun and stuff but my passengers side window in the cabin can not be
opened while the shade is down. This is because the lock on the window
interferes with the pull down blind.

The water fill spout for the fresh water tank is ABOVE the main power panel
controlling the ground fault and fuse box for the cabin. Gee lets spill some
water while filling the water tank...SIZZLE, CRACK,POP....&quot;Hey....nothing
in the van works anymore&quot;. Need I say more. In the newer EV camper models
they have since put a fold down spout guard to prevent such spills so make sure
you get one.

Well, I think my .2 cents work is about up. If you have any more questions
about this drop me a line.
