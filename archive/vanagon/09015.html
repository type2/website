    &gt; Since I am new to owning a bus and haven't even had the chance to

    &gt; been for people driving VW busses. Are you picked out and searched
    &gt; often? Do you sometimes &quot;fit the description of someone&quot; they are
    &gt; &quot;looking for&quot;? Do they assume you have drugs in the van?

==Item the first, 1982==

Was pulled off the road in Maine in early
summer for driving too slow which was quoted
to me as &quot;According to Maine law, if you
have a tail of five or more cars, you must
pull off so as to let them all pass.&quot;  I was
doing the speed limit, and this was rural
Maine in the off season, so naturally I
accumulated a tail.  The officer passed my
tail in the left lane including cresting a
blind hill just so's he could pull me over
and tell me what an obstacle to travel I was.
Just a warning, thankfully.

==Item the second, 1989==

Take the car ferry from Portland (Maine)
to Yarmouth (Nova Scotia) which is, for
what it is worth, half vacationing families
in loaded down vehicles and half compulsive
gamblers who spend the entire overnight
trip at the slot machines that open up
when we cross the three-mile limit.

At the other end, the occasional vehicle
is pulled out for a thorough customs 
inspection.  We are, naturally, one of
the privileged few.  Unpack our incredibly
well packed van, explain why I have two
batteries and prove that both are really
batteries, pack it all up again, and mosey
on.  Note that all the other inspectees
are long-hairs of various sorts, some
so stoned looking that they may well have
eaten the stash on the boat...

==Item the third, 1992==

I picked up my daughter and two of her
friends at camp (East Otis, Mass., in
the Berkshires) and turned onto the
small and winding road that hugged the
shore of a small lake.  I was directly
behind one of those late 60's Cadillacs
that I generally call an &quot;aircraft carrier&quot;
and something small and red pretty soon 
came up behind me.  Within maybe 600 yards,
I was pulled over for doing 41 in a 30MPH
zone.  Mind you, I was still in a caravan
of three cars and had passed *no* speed
limit signs.  However, in pulling off
at a scenic overlook, I came to a stop
under a sign that said &quot;Speed Limit 40&quot;.

When the kind officer and I chatted, I 
said something like &quot;Gee, I didn't see
any speed limit sign and I was just in
a line of cars.&quot;  He said, &quot;Maybe so,
but you make the best radar target.&quot;

My insurance company (and my friends)
said &quot;fight it,&quot; but the court in question
met only Tuesdays and I was under a
contractural obligation to spend every
Tuesday &amp; Wednesday in NYC.  The court
in question would not take written
testimory, and would not permit you to
be represented by counsel in abstentia.
Verdict: guilty/default, 5 points on
the otherwise unblemished license.

Optimistic version: Caught speeding in
a 16 year old vehicle, uphill with three
teenagers -- should be proud!  Reminds
me of Arlo Guthrie's littering thing...

==Item the last, 1994==

Got pulled out of a line of cars inching 
around a construction site on a highway.
Officer, it turns out, is a van nut and
apologises for worrying me but wants to
complement me on the condition of my '78
and its brand-spanking new butter-yellow
paint job.


That's all folks
