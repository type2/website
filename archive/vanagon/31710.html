Subject: Re: Power brake booster on Type II

To All:

The vacuum cannister on a brake booster must also have an air inlet.  It is
usually equipped with a replaceable air filter, or is plumbed to the engine's
air filter.  I'm not familiar with the one on Volkswagen buses but given its
location I would suspect the second large diameter fitting to be the air
inlet, and would look for a filter or plumbing that would provide the booster
with filtered air.  The air inlet must have a low restriction, hence the
large diameter.  It is atmospheric pressure -- and the in-rush of air -- that
provides the 'boost'.  All the vacuum line does is create the low-pressure
needed to utilize atmospheric pressure to push the pedal for you.  When you
depress the brake you're actually opening a valve that allows atmospheric
pressure to reach the cannister's diaphram.  You definitely want that air to
be filtered.
