&gt;So... a few months ago there was a discussion of using EDTA to give new
&gt;life to batteries.  Can any chemist types explain how this is supposed to
&gt;work?  My sister (a chemist, but more biological) said she doesn't know
&gt;how it would work, but she gave me 29.2 grams for Xmas so I could try it
&gt;out.

The difficulty isn't with the chemistry involved, the trick is teaching your
battery how to snort the stuff.
