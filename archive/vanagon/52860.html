I replaced mine last year... found VW dealer wanted $170, so I decided 
to go the generic route.  I went to NAPA and found they could get the 
actual Bosch part for about $110, but wasn't in stock.  I wound up 
getting the right part (no splicing, heat shield fits) for around $90 
from Vee Parts in National City, CA.

I doubt I'll go back to the dealer again for anything, unless I need 
another one of those $40 cigarette lighters...
