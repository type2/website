Hi Gang,

Actually it's _my_ '93 Eurovan MV!

I'm going to phone this ad into the St. Paul Pioneer Press and Minneapolis Star 
&amp; Tribune tomorrow afternoon. If anyone on the list is interested or knows 
anyone who might be interested, give me a call at work at 612-627-1861 or at 
home at 612-298-8351.

&quot;93 VW EuroVan MV 50M, mostly highway, 5-speed, cruise, dual AC/heat, power 
everything, premium AM/FM/Cass. Seats 7, table, snap-in curtains, rear seat 
converts to bed. 1 MN Winter. Immaculate! Must see! $14500 298-8351&quot;

wish me luck! If anyone has any pointers regarding ad copy I'd appreciate them.





It's just really, really sad that Deborah doesn't want to be a two van 
family....&lt;sob!&gt;..&lt;choke!&gt;....  ;-)
