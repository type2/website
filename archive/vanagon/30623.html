Freaks,

Tailing a truck down a hill through the southwest in a '71 bus I hit 90 (in
gear).  This was a stock engine with the exception of an 009 distributor
running at 9 degrees BTDC.

In my '63 bus with an 1835 motor with dual carbs etc., I could cruise at
80-85.  I burned these heads up pretty quickly (this case is now The Old War
Horse, still running).  The speedo was undoubtably off though, so figure
75-80, 85 peaks.  This transaxle had early reduction gears (for 15&quot; wheels),
with 14 inch wheels and tires on the car so revs were higher than stock.
Very high that is.

My buses all have or had; tight steering, gas shocks, heavy-duty anti-sway
bars (5/8&quot;) front &amp; rear, good tires, pressure checked.

My '71 with a 1600 single port engine with dual carbs held a steady 70
across Arizona, New Mexico.  #3 exhaust guide failed about 5000 miles later.

Eug,
smushed '71
