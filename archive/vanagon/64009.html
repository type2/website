&gt;- my 2 cents worth.
&gt;
&gt;I'm an Australian, with a home in Denver (in the mountains at 8,500'),
&gt;currently working on assignment in New Orleans who lived for 2 years in
&gt;Boston...  Confused - you should try my end....
&gt;
&gt;The studed snow tires on my van (2 winters in mountains outside Denver)
&gt;worked great and i would not have it any other way - the van gets used as the
&gt;childrens taxi.  Even with the Synco and the Studed tires it slipped on
&gt;occasions - usually very icy and on a slope.  My recommendations to you are
&gt;to get 4 x studded tires - and then stay out of other peoples way, as they
&gt;will be much more of a danger to you, than you will be to yourself.  I do
&gt;that by taking as many back roads as possible when conditions are bad.  Kind
&gt;of hard to do in the North east tho..

Wow, if a Synchro with studded tires slips on ice, I will be careful. You 
are right about 
taking back roads in the Northeast. It is not easy. I have been waffling 
about 
whether I should sell my Acura Integra 89, or keep it for normal winter 
driving. 
I am getting more convinced I should keep it and use it for the short 
haul trips. 
It   gets better gas mileage for short trips to grocery store etc. It 
would also protect the Vanagon from overheating in summer for short 
trips. 

This is a very helpful list!

Thanks.
