Subject: Tach for '84

&gt; Hi Folks - has anyone tried to retrofit the tach from the &gt;85 vans into       
&gt; an '84?  My '84 has a clock where it SHOULD have a tach; said clock has 
&gt; inset fuel and wassertemp gauges (at 6 and 12 o'clock, respectively). I       
&gt; notice from Bentley that my fuel gauge (at least) has a different scale       
&gt; factor than the &gt;85 guage and that the cluster has a different harness,       
&gt; not to mention Bentley doesn't show my temp gauge... in short, it             
&gt; doesn't look like the drop-in that I had hoped for.  Has anyone done it?      
&gt;                                                                               
&gt; -Ed                                                                           
&gt; meed_at_mbari_dot_org                                                                
                                                                                
        This info may not help, but, I swapped the cluster from                 
an '85 GL (with tach using those nice colors) into my '85 L.  The               
L has a clock, etc. where the tach went.  A drop-in job - I did 
have to run one additional wire from the cluster to the distributor.  
I still have the L instrument cluster buried somewhere in the basement.
Your '84 wiring is that much different?
