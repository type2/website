Subject: Re: alt. &amp; OXS lights freaky

&gt;Started yesterday, battery and OXS lights are coming on together. 
&gt;They'll stay on a while then go off and stay off a while. 

&gt; As such, I'm
&gt;thinking that maybe the wind was just right to get water behind my dash
&gt;somehow?  I think a couple of drops actually fell from the bottom of the
&gt;dash onto the floor while I was driving--reason for my suspicions.

Hello,
	My '86 started doing this 2 days ago, now the lites are on all the time.
The alt is not putting out, I checked the battery with a meter.
	Cold and snow here, no wet behind the dash.
	My next step is to pull the alt and take it down to a shop to have it
tested. Right now I'm recharging the battery so the bus doesn't get anyone
stranded. 
	Now if my garage was only warm!
	Later all,

	Rob
