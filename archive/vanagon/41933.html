In a message dated 96-05-13 10:53:45 EDT, you write:

&gt; anyway i noted throughout you mentioned something called a &quot;List 
&gt;     Subscriber&quot;  how does one become a &quot;List Subscriber&quot;?

Charles,

Their are mailing lists devoted to items of interest to Volkswagen owners.
 The Vintage VW mailing list covers sedans, the Vanagon list all Type II's,
etc.  I am a subscriber of the Vanagon list (listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu).  I
don't know the addresses for the others but there are several.

To become a subscriber you simply send a message to the address of the
mailing lists controlling program, listserv in the case above.  The subject
is left blank or a filler is inserted if your software does not allow a blank
field.  In the body of the message you say....  subscribe vanagon (your name)

The ListServor software picks off your e-mail address, adds you to the
mailing list and sends you a confirmation.  Thereafter, you will receive from
ten to 100 messages per day from that list.  Or you may opt to receive one
'packaged' message per day.

Once you've become a subscriber you can send a message -- a question or
response -- to all of the other listmembers simply by addressing it to the
list's distribution address, which is different from the control program's
address.  

The Vanagon list presently has about 650 active members.  The Vintage VW list
is larger but less active and has a lower level of expertise.
