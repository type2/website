Subject: Re: BusBoys~catalogs and more...(less?)



from all that i have read and numerous people that i have talked to i haven't 
heard of ANYONE getting a flipping catalouge from BS Boys (pun intended :) I 
would personally stay away from them. If they can't get their *&amp;^%*% act 
together to send a catalouge to a friggin' potential customer I would hate to 
think of the way that they treat actual customers.

Then again I couldn't bring myself to actually _pay_ money for their promotional 
material. I would rather just write to RMMW and get a much better (IMHO) 
catalouge for free :)

Just mt $0.02 FWIW
