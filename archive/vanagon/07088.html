So William Abbott says:
&gt; 	And Steven Johnson replied:
&gt; &gt; I would, but I'm afraid that getting it smogged would be out of the question. :(
&gt; 	Steven, Bubba!
     Bubba?.....  I've been called alot of things in my time (just ask Ric
     ;) ) but NEVER Bubba.   Does this mean I have to move to the South
     and eat grits with Joel?  ;)  

Bill, Eric and others (sorry for not mentioning names) that kindly responded
to my smog concern,

Okay, I get the gist of being able to put in a newer engine in an older
vehicle.  So, as I understand it, the Porsche smog equipment needs to
come with the engine.  That makes sense, since how the hell is the old
equipment suppose to work like the newer stuff? (duh)  I'd be concerned
about some of the mechanicals though.  Would I need a beefier starter?
Alternator?  And wouldn't the 5 or 6 speed Porsche transmission be nice
too. (Drool)  I'm sure the packaged conversions probably include this stuff 
so that a good match is made.  But what if you wanted to do this on your
own?  I'm not sure I'll do this, but I'd like to know what the laundry
list is before I decided.   (Mucho dinero) :[ ]
