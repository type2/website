Subject: Re: Good News Story? 

Soap box ranting to follow, please skip if not interested in trivial 
opinions....

&gt; This is good news? New engine at 18K!! Never stranded in 38K! JEEZ!

The engine was replaced as a preventative measure.  It is not a certainty 
that it would have failed in 200K!  Mine might need the same preventative 
fix but it isn't a big deal if they want to give me an engine is it?  
Ignore that 18K as it wasn't a problem.  My engine has the same symptoms 
as his did and its got twice as many miles.  Gonna get VW to replace it 
anyway.  38k miles of no problems IS significant.

&gt; The only time my Tercel failed  was a 5 minute intermittant 
&gt; problem that occurred at just beyond 100K miles and I was really miffed
&gt; that the  piece of S**t failed so early in its life! Had it needed a tow, 
&gt; I would have been really mad! The 'ignitor' in
&gt; the ignition was replaced, and the problem never re-occurred
&gt; This is the only part other than brakes, exhaust that has been replaced.
&gt; Of course at 110,000 miles, its just getting broken in.

I get really tired of hearing how reliable Toyotas are.  I hear this from 
people one day.  The next I'm trying to replace their second turbo in 
under 100k miles.   Or I replace their 5th light bulb in the same socket 
in 2 years.  I don't see all that many Toyotas from the 60s or 70s still 
rolling.  I remember them but never see them.  Sure VW outsold (by a 
HUGE) margin the Japanese then - bigger than their margin over VW now I'd 
bet.  But they aren't more reliable than my silly Chevy S10 pickup.  Its 
never failed me either.  So?

Don't delude yourself about a Japanese car with 100k just getting broken 
in.  That is a lot of miles on any car.  Cheap little compacts have a 
better chance of having no failures over lengths of time like 100k 
miles.  They don't have the extra gadgets that more expensive cars do.  
Equally complex cars have about equally long times between failures.  I 
had a Japanese car.  It was highly complex - Mitsubishi made though it 
said Chrysler Conquest on it.  It was about as reliable as any other 
'almost super car'.  Not very.  But I got over a 100K miles on it with no 
major malfunctions.  Only minor ones were caused by bad design.  

Ric and I both have the EV MV.  This is far more complex than a Toyota 
Tercel.  Tercel is one of the simplest cars made.  What does it have that 
would go wrong?  My Mom's Rabbit had 100K miles with no problems either 
and she did NOT take care of it.  Rabbit was a bit more complex (not 
much) than a Tercel.  All modern cars are more reliable than older cars 
at the same complexity level.  Plain and simple fact.  BUT all modern 
cars are also not as simple as older cars.  A car made twenty years from 
now will be even more reliable at the same complexity level as cars made 
now but again will be more complex so you will again have the competeing 
factors.

&gt; You guys seem to have a bent view of RELIABLE?

Yeah.  Really bent.  We expect the vehicle to last some 4 or 5 decades.  
No reason the EVs won't make it as the Spit windows from the 50s have.
