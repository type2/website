&gt; How does the warp metric go?  Is Warp 8 just 8 times lightspeed, or more?
&gt; I got the impression that high warp speeds got travel from planet to planet
&gt; down in a timeframe that fit into a few days, if not an episode, and *just*
&gt; 8 x lightspeed wouldn't do that.  Or have I been at the bottom of this 
&gt; gravity well too long.

from the 
             PERIODIC LIST OF &quot;FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS&quot;
          in REC.ARTS.STARTREK.TECH (last updated 17 June 1994)
we see that the relationship for warp speeds is:
  For TOS(The Original Series), speed is (warp ^ 3) * c, which yields:

      warp    c
      ----  ----
       1       1
       2       8
       3      27
       4      64
       5     125
       6     216
       7     343
       8     512
       9     729
       9.6   884.736
       9.99  997.002999
      10    1000
      11    1331
      12    1728
      13    2197
      14.1  2803.221

&gt;From TNG (The New Generation):
  The ST:TNG  Writer's  Technical Manual,  third season  edition contains 
  the following table:

      warp    c   comment
      ----  ----  -------
       1       1
       2      10
       3      39
       4     102
       5     214
       6     392  normal cruising speed.
       8    1024
       9    1516
       9.6  1909  maximum attainable speed for E
       9.9  3053  maximum speed for E under any circumstances
       9.99 7912
      10    infinite

    Notes not from the guide:

For warp speeds 1 through 9, the formula  w ^ (10/3) * c  provides the
numbers shown, rounded to the integer.Note that with these figures, the  
TOS warp  14.1 translates  to about warp 9.7 for TNG.
The fastest the original Enterprise has gone (not counting &quot;off the 
scale&quot;) was 14.1 in &quot;That Which Survives&quot;.  Apparently the original version 
of this episode actually has a &quot;15.2&quot;, but the version that gets run in 
syndication (at least the one I taped) has this line cut.

The Enterprise-D  seems to  have a  top speed  slightly less  than 10, (and
occasions when Q flung it a great distance).  Riker mentioned  that warp 10
instigates time travel.  In &quot;Where No One Has Gone Before&quot;  it is mentioned
that the Enterprise has reached or passed warp 10

I wonder if I can fit a warp drive into my '78 to replace the dead
2 liter?
