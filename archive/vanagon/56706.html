Subject: Re: Parting out 1980-1991 Vanagons

&gt;I got more vans from insurance auctions that I am parting out including one
with
&gt;alloy wheels and jump seats.  Also have several 83-85 engines complete and
&gt;several transmissions. 

What do you have in the way of exhaust crossover pipe and/or outside sliding
door handle for an '82 Vanagon?
