Subject: Re: '78 Westy vs '88 Westy ?

&gt; I now have a tough decision to make between two nice Westies (or
&gt; maybe neither):
&gt; 
&gt; 1&gt; a '78 with 37K on rebuilt engine, 137K total. New paint, interior
&gt; original and complete but in poor to fair shape. Paint job of average
&gt; quality only (ie: poptop painted, but failed to remove seal first...)
&gt; Will need: 4 new tires, poptop seal right away. Canvas, brakes and
&gt; shocks will need attention soon.
&gt; Calif. bus, so no major rust (or *very* good body work to hide it)
&gt; Drives well, clutch feels good, throttle &amp; trans linkage good.
&gt; Steering feels tight, but shocks may be gone, as it dips &amp; leans a
&gt; lot. 3rd owner, but has all receipts.
&gt; Asking price $5800 CDN, may get it for $5000-5500
&gt; Add in $500-1000 for new parts needed = $5500-6500 CDN
&gt; 
&gt; 2&gt; an '88 with 320K total, 160K on new engine, trans &amp; driveshafts.
&gt; One owner, all receipts. Looks immaculate, new tires, new paint on
&gt; front section.
&gt; Have not driven yet, so can't say much more.
&gt; Needs new poptop seal.
&gt; Asking $9995 on dealer lot, would offer maybe $8000 if it checks
&gt; out ok.
&gt; Total price, maybe $8000-8500 incl new parts needed.
&gt; 
&gt; So, my questions are:
&gt; 1. I like the '78, but I'm having a hard time believing it's worth
&gt; only ~$3000 less than one 10 years newer. Does this seem a bit high
&gt; for a '78?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. I would buy the '88 mainly to get more space, a 3 way fridge, and
&gt; better hwy driving. My thinking is that when the heads/gaskets go, I
&gt; would spend the $2000+ on a conversion to a Jetta 4cyl engine, either
&gt; gas or turbo diesel, instead of putting more money into a poor engine
&gt; design. Is this sound logic? How hard is it to find the engine
&gt; mounts, tranny, etc from a diesel van to complete this conversion? My
&gt; thinking is that $1000 will buy a very good used or rebuilt 4cyl engine, leaving
&gt; another $1000 to complete the conversion.
&gt; (I know the above topic's been discussed a lot, I'm just wondering
&gt; how feasible the idea is without going into the details.)
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.

&gt; Shawn.

&gt; I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!

So talk the 78 down to $3000.  Ask them if you can bring it to BCAA or your VW 
favorite machanic (preferable) for a pre-purchase check.  Then use their 
written report to bring the price down to earth.

That's how I got Lief down to $3900 from $4500 and he was in excellent shape.

Good luck.
