Subject: Re: Vanagon Tire Information -- Tires &amp; Companies

&gt;I just ordered a set of Yokohoma 185/75 R14 Load Range C.
&gt;I don't know the model # or the load carrying capacity, but will post it 

When I bought the Y370G in 8 ply the dealer wanted more for the 6ply above, 
I paid $100 vs $120Cdn. No idea why, nor did the dealer &quot;older model, 
maybe&quot;. Maybe you should check on the 8 plies fast!
