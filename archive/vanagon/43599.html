Subject: sway bar kit on a breadloaf

My camper would tend to wander around in my lane on the freeways.
The aerodynamic &quot;bow wake&quot; from passing trucks tended to push me 
aside then suck me back once they passed.
Another handling problem in high-speed (65 mph) cornering was like 
the van was tipping over.  Then the front end would plow in and 
bounce a little bit.  Understeer caused me to slow down quite a 
bit to stay in my lane and not tip over.

I put some new KYB gas shocks on a couple months ago.  The ride
has improved.  Kind of like wearing a new pair of running 
shoes with lots of &quot;cush&quot; in the soles.  The handling problems 
are still there though.

Last week I had the ball joints replaced at a local repair shop.
(The rubber boots on the joints had split open at least 3 years
ago and I noticed that the bushings on the front sway bar were
cracked and deteriorating.  You would be too after 22 years under
a VW camper :)
While it was all apart I asked them to add a sway bar kit as
it went back together.  The ball joints were really shot.
The kit adds a larger than stock sway bar in the front and a
new sway bar to the rear.  Urethane bushings and hardware, etc.
The kit is from sway-a-way and cost about 200 clams. This is the 
only sway bar kit I could find for a type2. Disclaimer: I'm just 
an end-user, no affiliation.  This is not an infomercial.

Now that I have the van back and done some testing I can say
that there is a big differance in the handling.  The &quot;bow wake&quot;
problem is practically nil.  When cornering the rear end stays
down and level with the road surface. No more tipping over.
The steering has improved.  The van goes where I point it and
no more understeer.  It is not so quick to return to driving
straight on it's own when exitting a turn, but that is not 
unbearable, just differant from the way it was before.

YMMV,
