Subject: Removing steering box

I'm in digest mode so it's harder to reply to messages, but I've seen some
traffic in the last couple of days about how to get a steering box off.  I
just removed mine a week ago ('71 Westy).  Getting the arm off the shaft
WAS a pain, but I managed it using a two jawed puller.  I'd tried on a
couple of other buses, ones that were being scrapped and the owners said
for $$ you can have whatever you want.  In each case I was unsuccessful using
regular pullers so I had to leave them.  The replacement box I ended up getting
came from a junkyard and they cut the drop arm or whatever with a torch,
then pulled it with the box off the car.  So when I went to take the arm off
mine, I stopped by the local VW shop and asked them &quot;How the hell do YOU
guys get these off??&quot;  They said &quot;With a Pittman arm puller.&quot;  It's basically
a very hefty, C-shaped lump of steel with a bolt through the middle.  I
rented it for $6.  It looks exactly like the one in my Bentley book.  I think
the secret here is that it's all one piece so it doesn't want to flop around
and come off like the general purpose pullers.  The ends of the C part are
fixed at about an inch apart, big enough to clear the shaft but not the lever
you're trying to get off.  I put it on, tightened it WAY tight, and rapped on
the lever with it under tension in the hopes of it springing off.  Nothing
happened and the puller was slipping a little so I loosened it and centered
it better and turned it so one jaw was positioned close to the lever part.
(So if that jaw slipped a little it would still have something to grab.)  When
I tightened it again, I still had to put some effort into it but not near as
much as the first time.  I suspect the first time might have cocked/flexed
it enough to help.  I didn't use any heat or WD40, etc., and this is the
only one I was able to get off so I'd recommend getting a Pittman arm puller.
Someone (sorry, I forgot who) said the lever will fit through the arm in
the frame.  I tried that on the first one, but no luck for me.  But maybe
I just wasn't patient enough.  :-)  Hope this helps someone out!
