&gt; As I understand it there were four choices in colour for the early
&gt; Vanagons, blue, ivory, brown and white.....any others?...DC -- 

I have an '84 (I guess that would be considered an early Vanagon?)
and it is maroon on the bottom and cream/ivory on top.  I have only 
seen two other Vanagons with this color scheme.
