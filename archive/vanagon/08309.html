&gt;Can I ask that this thread be extended a bit?  I would love a glossary of
&gt;some of the terms used here.  For instance, I assume a Devon is a
&gt;Westfalia in England, but until Thom said &quot;no, no&quot; I always assumed that
&gt;&quot;barn doors&quot; were the double side doors that opened out from the center on
&gt;busses thru '67.  OK, I'll play ignorant (it's a natural talent for me),
&gt;can we write a VW glossary?  If not this Friday, then next?

Exactly what do we want in this glossary?  Just a list of terms and their
definitions ie: wing - fender (of which my bus has neither :) or
how about Luposlipophibia - the fear of being chased around a freshly waxed
kitchen floor while wearing only socks?
