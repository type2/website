Subject:      more on lifter noise

I should mention that unlike Brad's experience (see


http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/cgi-bin/msg?m=msg05952&amp;a=/v97/vanagon.97.06),

I do have oil coming out of the relief valve hole (unscrewed
partially) and out of the filter hole.  I even took the filter off,
drained it, put it back on, started, stopped, found there was plenty
of oil in there.  The level seems OK, and I even drove it around the
block to make sure this wasn't from my slanted driveway.

Oh well, I guess I need to really warm up the engine to see if the
noise will go away.

Sorry for the rambling use of bandwidth.

-Karl
