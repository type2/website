Subject: leaky oil pressure switch II
Date: Tue, 26 Mar 96 17:04:41 EST

Hey all,
Well, I went out today and bought a deep reach 24mm socket and a
3/8&quot;drive-1/2&quot; drive converter.  This cost about $7.42.  I tried the
socket to see if it would fit and bingo, fits easy.  In fact, this is
going to be much easier than I thought.  I can get the socket on
perfectly and the switch easily screws right out (I tried just to make
sure).  Now all I have to do is await delivery of the switch and then I
will have a non-leaky oil pressure switch.

Thanks for the help everybody.

Sean
