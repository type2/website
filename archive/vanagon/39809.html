&gt;        Getting Back on the Horse

 This message was so inspiring that I will let Bob (Veeduber) do all my
machine work even if I have to clean the blood later. Serious now, I'm
making a couple of print outs and putting them inside my resto project (56
Micro), one in the garage and one in each tool box.

 Elocuent and inspiring. Thanks!
