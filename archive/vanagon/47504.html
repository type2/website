Subject: Re: O2 sensors: 1-wire to replace 3-wire?

&gt; Any three wire one will do -- just cut off the wrong connector and splice on
&gt; the old one from yours (assuming you have the old one).  I don't even know
&gt; what mine is to -- I just went into Chief and asked for a three-wire 
&gt; sensor.  It cost about $35 (they were on sale)  The salescritter looked at
&gt; me a little strange...
&gt; 
Hi.  I've asked around for the last few days, and every parts store is 
telling me that not just any three-wire sensor will do.  Are they all 
just rying to sell me a more expensive part.  I've heard that some have 
different threading and different temp. ratings.  Anyway, does anyone 
here know the deal for sure?  I've asked a few parts stores for a generic 
3-wire sensor, and they claim not to have one.

I'd like to get back on the road, so any help would be appreciated.
