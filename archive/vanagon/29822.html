88 Westy Shock Test?
Hi,

Anyone know how to tell if shocks are good/bad?  My 88 Westy is seeming a little
rough/noisy in the bumps.  Also notice a squeeky-ish sound if I jump on the
bumper (I know... 'just don't jump on the bumper and it won't make that noise').
 Haven't crawled under yet to see what's making the noise.

Any suggestions for tests/replacement shocks are appreciated in a big way.  Thanks.

Also, anyone have an email address for Dave Garth?  The photos of his aux.
battery and (vented) catalytic heater on one of the web pages are very
interesting.  Dave, if you're reading this and could  explain the venting system
on your Westy, I would like to hear about it.
