Yeah, they shouldn't be blocked.  But they may be just covers that will pop
off with a little prying.  If not, drill 'em.

&gt;
&gt;My question is: do I drill out the extractor where it connects to the
&gt;manifold heat riser tubes, or is it supposed to be blocked? I can't imagine
&gt;how it could work without drilling a hole for some hot exhaust gas to warm
&gt;the manifold.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
