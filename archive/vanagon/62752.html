Subject: Tach swap?

Hello-

I want to put a tach in my &quot;new&quot; 83 water-cooled Westy. I've never been quite
so far from an engine, and since i replaced that noisey transmission I can't
hear when to shift. Instead of a tach I have that HUGE clock in the dash-- as
if I need to be reminded of my mortality.

I understand the later Vanagons have the tach in that spot. Can I just find a
later model (in a junkyard I mean I've read about the alarms) and install
that tach in my vehicle? Will my gas gauge and temp gauge fit in the new
tach, or does the tach have different fuel and temp gauges? If different will
my existing senders work accurately with the new gauges? Or, and finally,
should I, or do I have to replace the entire instrument cluster using the
later model speedo and digital clock etc.

Any advice from those who know or have done the swap will be appreciated.

Thanks
Jeff
83 Westy
