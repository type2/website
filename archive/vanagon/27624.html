&gt; I plan to buy this afternoon an inverter from Shoppers Advantage/CUC.
&gt; 
&gt; I have identified the PC600 Focus Industries model as the best value for
&gt; general purpose use. The prices are unbelievable. Here's what I see:
&gt; 
&gt; PC 600 $158

Grrr... that's $40 less than I paid for it, but I guess that's the way
it goes.

&gt; PC 1500 $358

Get this one if you want to run a microwave.  The PC600 just barely cuts
it, and only with the smallest microwaves.  =)

&gt; The current All Electronics Corp. closeout catalog shows these same
&gt; inverters for double the price so I know this is a great deal. 

It is.  I bought from Damark, and their prices are hard to beat.
 
&gt; If anyone has advice on why *not* to proceed with this purchase please post
&gt; the reason right away.

Go for it!
 
&gt; The only hitch might be that these inverters don't say what kind of wave
&gt; they have. I assume we are talking about a modified sine wave but for all I
&gt; know these are square wave inverters, which would be a disaster I guess. I
&gt; wonder when it would make sense to pay up for a true sine wave.

They do say they produce a modified sine wave.  They seem to be at least
as good as other modified sine wave inverters I have used in the past.
The PC600 runs all my power tools, a 26&quot; TV, and most kitchen appliences
just great.  Does need a good strong battery tho.
