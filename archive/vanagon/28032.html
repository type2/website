Subject: One Born Every Minute?

Fellow Splitters and Splitterettes:

A year ago I bought a '66 Deluxe for $200, saved it from the
crusher.  I didn't really need a 4th, but figured someone
might try to save it if I could find the right person.  No
buyers came along (I didn't really advertise), but this fall
a friend with a '66 single cab screwed his transaxle, asked
if he could have my &quot;extra&quot; and we settled for $100.  While
pulling the tranny, he said he could use a few other parts.
I said &quot;sure&quot; and he spent a lot of time pulling things of
the '66.

I haven't seen the $100, but he called last night, said he'd
be here today with the cash and could he take some more
parts (ignition switch &amp; door handles with matching locks)
for his single cab.

My question:  Am I being a good friend or a sucker by
letting him feast for parts on this (now obviously)
parts-only bus?

One born every minute, they say.
