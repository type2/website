Subject: Re: '66 Split Window  (long version)

I am no doubt in violation of some &quot;edict&quot; for leaving the text 
intact on these 3 interchanges. Then I screwed that up by putting 
the original in the middle. Since it seems to be a freudian attempt
by my sub-concious to be politically correct I decided to leave it 
there. 
 I have not heard from Bob yet but he will probably want the one in 
the woods. Those who are trying to follow this and want to know who
Bob is, Well - - - - there is a town up here, rather smallish or I
would remember the name, we'll call it &quot;X&quot; for right now.
I'll tell you about X later. The man we refer to is the world famous
Rapid Robert Hoover, often reffered to by his inferiors as &quot;Bob&quot;.
Below us inferiors is a group known as &quot;lurkers&quot; and even most of them
have heard of &quot;Bob Hoovers Sermons&quot;. Look him up and read of &quot;The Hair-Ball
Run&quot; and of &quot;Grendel&quot; who was rescued far past the knick of time. Major
Adventure.
 What I had not realized until now was the chord of fear he struck 
in some of you wimps. Sheee - anybody can weld on dry ground!
Anybody can get their hubs turned at the FLAPS! 
 You did say you wanted a Sun-Roof!       :-)      west


&gt;&quot;bargain poor&quot; mike west described a couple of buses with the &quot;FO&quot; option.
&gt;Hmmm.... (I won't say a thing):
&gt;.I think I pass on the splitty deal to you all if some one
&gt;has a need. If you don't want then give me an opinion any way.
&gt;
&gt;Ellis suggests that maybe if Bob Hoover is going to visit your neck of the
&gt;woods...     Er, never mind. ;-)

&gt;&gt;Went out to Cave Junction, Ore this morning and looked at a '66
&gt;&gt;Has an &quot;F0&quot; engine possible original 1300. Rust: bottom of side doors
&gt;&gt;and I think a piece of the panel under the doors.Not gone but need
&gt;&gt;surgery. Drivers floor is cancer, about 12&quot; square. Right rear corner
&gt;&gt;is caved but fixable. This is the 4? windows behind door job. All
&gt;&gt;windows are there tho drivers window has full length crack.
&gt;&gt;Spare is bolted to front with 3 rusty bolts, no apparent cancer in
&gt;&gt;area (like the spare didn't fall on me when I pulled on it).
&gt;&gt;Battery area on right side rear is gone. Cute board to cover it.
&gt;&gt;Rear fender wells cut back tastefully to get the BIG RUBBER in there.
&gt;&gt;The head liner is in good shape. The wall stuff is gone and some one
&gt;&gt;has started stuffing insulation in. There is no interior except head
&gt;&gt;liner. Not even the driver seat. Dash is clean and all there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The other one: He tells me a guy gave him the other one and it is sitting
&gt;&gt;outside at Lake Selmac (few miles away) the whole interior
&gt;&gt;is gone he says and rust has settled in on everything. Has rougher body and
&gt;&gt;no engine. The windows are there but some broken. No title
&gt;&gt;abandoned on property and owner wants to sell property.So gave him
&gt;&gt;Van. Still has tranny.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm, let's see: A rusty, basically roached out splittie in the woods
&gt;of the Pacific Northwest, possible freebie, needs LOTS of work to even
&gt;get it roadworthy if that's possible...
&gt;
&gt;Who ya gonna call?
&gt;
&gt;Sounds in &quot;Good Condition&quot; to me!!!     :^)  Steve Maher
