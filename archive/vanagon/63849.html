Passing it on:

&gt; 1972 Bus good parts vehicle $400 obo.
&gt;     ---------------
&gt; This bus will be a good parts vehicle or perhaps a vehicle to restore if
&gt; you have the time. There is very little rust on the body. As of now it
&gt; does not run but does have a new starter and coil. I do not have the time
&gt; to get it running so whoever gets here with the money can have it. I do
&gt; have the shop manuals for it and will include these in the price.You can
&gt; call me at the following number (217) 348-1192 Please do not call after
&gt; 11p.m. central time. My name is eric and I do have a machine so leave a
&gt; message if interested thank you.
