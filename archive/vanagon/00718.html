BUSES BY THE ARCH 6: May 27, 28, &amp; 29, 1994

RAIN OR SHINE! BBTA 6 will be held in Ft. Zumwalt Park in O'Fallon (a suburb
type city in St. Louis... sorry if that is an offensive statement), Missouri.
The park is 1/2 mile from Interstate 70 and about 30 miles from downtown St.
Louis. Campfires, volleyball, parts swapping, VW vidoes, slides, training
films etc., socializing, etc. Saturday there will be a caravan. The caravan
will be boarding 2 ferries to cross both the Illinois and the Mississippi
Rivers, picnic in a park along the way, and then back to the campground (Ft.
Zumwalt Park). There are 40 sites along 2 loops (note: as they fill, actually
they'll be filling the spaces in between.) There is a bathroom and shower
facilities. THERE IS AN EVENT FEE OF $20.00 PER BUS OR VW WHICH INCLUDES YOUR
CAMPSITE FEES WHETHER YOU STAY FOR 1,2 OR 3 NIGHTS (IN LOOP #1 ONLY). Most
activities center around loop #1. Loop number 2 has electric &amp; water and cost
$10.00 per night. CAMPSITES CAN'T BE RESERVED. (Note: most empty space will be
used so it hasn't been a problem when I've been there). Last year at this time
there were something like 66 buses, and a number of other VWs. Last September
(yes it happens twice a year), there were 74 buses.

FOR MORE INFO: Send a SASE to &quot;Buses by the Arch, 1514 Wild Goose Run, St.
Charles, MO 63303.

Oh by the way... O'Fallon is at EXIT #217 on I-70. See ya there!
