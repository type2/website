Subject:       LDT (Long Drive Theory) and other musings

My OTHER vehicle is an '86 Toyota Camry.  231,000 miles, uses nary a 
drop of oil (I hate to admit this but I don't even check it between 
changes-- it just never goes down!) and engine never been in need of 
any repair aside to routine timing belts etc.  Here's (IMHO) the key: 
 2500mi oil changes and *long* daily trips of about 100-250 miles (I 
drove alot for my job).

Speaking of Toyota, why can they make such a dang good car.  Before 
you guys flame me to death, please understand I have my true 
allegiance to the quirky stuff, stuff with character.  I'ved owned 
(and loved) Fiat 850 &amp; 124 Spyders, Volvo 1800s, Nortons, Bultacos, 
Hodakas, and my share of VWs.  But gosh darnit all, it sure is nice to get in, turn 
the key and go.  Maybe I'm getting old.  Someone help me.
