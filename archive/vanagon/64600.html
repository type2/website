&lt;&lt; I recently got my 87 Westy Syncro realigned and the mechanic told me I
 needed a new Rack and Pinion. I don't have the $700 required to fix it.
 What happens if I don't get it repaired?
 Thank you in advance,
 Brent Gardner &gt;&gt;


you can get rebuilt power steering racks for 200-300 range...
