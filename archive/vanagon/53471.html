llege town!
&gt;
&gt;Due to circumstances beyond my control (Damn! I miss her and the kids)
&gt;bankruptcy is imminent, so I can't afford much. Anybody have or know of one
&gt;of these for $25.00 or so - I think I could afford that, plus shipping. A
&gt;U-PullIt place in Florida had one when I was down there a few years ago - I
&gt;shoulda got it, it was only five bucks!
&gt;
&gt;And if you want the story's gory details in return as well, I'll provide
&gt;them. And, yes, I still love her, but that's probably irrelevant. The one
&gt;who's been left always does, no?

I'm curious, did she leave you because of your Vanagon obcession?  My Vee
Dubb hobbies have come close to ruining relationships.  But in the long
run, the VWs will be more satisfying ;-).  Sure, send me the gory details,
I want to hear about other people's personal agony for a change.
