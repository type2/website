Subject: Re: propane tank label--dange...

&gt;Under Florida Law, the label must be firmly affixed to the tank or the
&gt;propane dealer will not fill the tank.  Some of the newer tanks have all the
&gt;information (date of manufacture, last date of inspection, etc..) stamped
&gt;into the collar guard of the tank and therefore will produce no need for a
&gt;label...
&gt;
The last time I took my gas grill propane tank in, the supplier just gave me 
a peel-n-stick generic label to put on, since the original was not in 
readable shape.  Now, this is in Texas.......
