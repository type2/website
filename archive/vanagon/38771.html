Local paper ran a story about workers finding gold nuggets in an 
excavation for a major retail development in this town (about 35,000 
people near in a gold mining area).

Follows last year's story about replacing the old Post Office clock with a 
new digital one with computerised chimes instead of the lovely brass bell.

Fools a lot of people every year, including my SO. Boy, did she feel silly.
