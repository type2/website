&gt;Anyway, is there a recommended replacement (preferably a cast iron
&gt;replacement) for the Vanagon lug wrench.

best lug nut wrench: sold at vw dealers (well, at least at my dealer in
atlanta): Votex Bolt Spanner 000-093-005B, $15. comes with reversible
socket for 19mm and 17mm (for Mercedes). handle is extendable, and it
really helps loosening/tightening.

this thing really is nice, folks. :)
