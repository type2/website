Subject: headliner question


I would like soon to replace the headliner on my '81 westy.  When
I acquired it last spring in original condition, the masonite-type
ceiling panels were covered with some sort of plastic contact-paper-
like covering, most of which I peeled and stripped off by first
heating it with a hair dryer, causing the adhesive to soften and
make the job much easier.  In one section, I tried using real contact
paper to see how it would hold up under temperature changes and
use, but its adhesion was in my opinion not very satisfactory.

Am considering using something like a suede cloth, a vellux
blanket-type material, or perhaps even polyester fleece for
insulation, sound reduction, etc.  Has anyone had any experience
with this, and if so, can you recommend an adhesive?

Thanks!
