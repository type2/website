yee haw, i am a happy camper:)

anyway, yesterday i am driving down the freeway in my blue '73 pop-top
bus, bee-bopping along when all of a sudden the generator light
flickers.  uhh ohhh i think,  it goes off, then comes back, then off,
then on to stay.  i pull over, the engine is not to hot, can hold the
dip stick with no problem.  the altenator belt deflects more than 1/2
an inch (i am terrible at estimation) and looks a little shiny in
places.  hmmm, i think.  so i tighten it up (after reading and
rereading muir's book, i am new to this mechanic thing), and head on
down the highway twords home.  no more light.  later that night it
starts acting up again, and now today it stays on after it is started
and goes on and off after i reach a good cruising speed.  i plan on
replacing the belt and if that doesn't work i will replace the
alternator and voltage resistor tomorrow.  the lights are bright (even
left them on all day yesterday, had to get a jump, but it started
right up and no problems today starting it).

anyway i am happy because this will be the first actual repair i will
do myself (even if it is just a belt), and was wondering if there was
anything else that would be recomended to do if i end up replacing the
alternator such as:

-- well brandy if you are going to go through the trouble of replacing
the alternator you might as well....

		or

-- hey brandy, before you replace that alternator you might want to
look at...

		OR

-- hey you fool, you are going to drive that bus to the store and buy
a belt!!!  that is extremely stupid!!!!!  hike into town, get the
belt, hike back and then replace it:)

any info or insults would be appreciated.  take care all!!!!
