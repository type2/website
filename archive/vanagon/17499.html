Subject: Re: Door swings shut?


&gt;  What keeps the driver's door open? Seems like there's some piece
&gt;  missing, I want to be able to open it and have it stay open, not
&gt;  swing back shut on my legs. Anyone who knows what they're doing
&gt;  have any advice? Thank you!!

I don't know much about anything but Vanagons.  If your is one of those, you
are probably missing the door check rod.  I just replaced one in my Vanagon
last week ($31 from VW).  You have to take the door panel off, remove the
vapor barrier at the lowest hole and remove whatever is there, screwed to
the inside of the front of the door, and replace it.  On my '85, the
nechanism itself has a plastic cover, the rod goes out through a hole in the
front of the door and connects to the door frame by means of a pin and a clip.

The part was special order and took three days to arrive.  BTW, I replaced
the vapor barrier with 4 mil vinyl and double stick tape.

Well, this is the reason:
It's because on that night you are in somebody else's dream.
And the reason you can't be in your own dream because
you're already busy in somebody else's dream.
