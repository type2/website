Subject: Skylight (Westfalia) replacement questions

     All-
     
     First, I've been over to the archive, and an answer to the upcoming 
     question was not readily apparent.
     
     My '91 has had the skylight replaced with a 14&quot; square RV roof vent 
     that sticks up at least 3-4&quot; above the roof line.  In order to do 
     this, the pop top has obviously had surgery.  Consequently, there's 
     little if any hope of ever making it &quot;right&quot; again (although I can cut 
     the section out of a rolled  Westfallia at the wrecking yard for $20, 
     I'd still have to replace the $100+ cover, and who wants to do all 
     that fiberglas work?).
     
     I've fantasized that I might be able to find a suitably-sized flush 
     mount aftermarket sunroof, but the best I can do is a 14&quot;X 24&quot; or 18&quot;x 
     22&quot; unit, both at somewhat over $100.
     
     Has anyone seen a small square unit of this type?
     
     Barring that, does anyone have any *practical* experience in a 
     conversion of this type?  I'm sure it's techically doable (as long as 
     the curvature of the roof can be maintained).  Big question is, would 
     a 14-by-whatever hole in the poptop be a serious compromise in the 
     durability/reliability of the roof as a whole?  Even with the sunroof 
     securely in place?
     
     (What I'm looking for is someone who, with the authority of experience 
     or good science, will stand up and wail, &quot;Oh my god, don't do it!&quot;)
     
     TIA
     
     -Blaine (hoping someday to park &quot;it&quot; in the garage)
     
     BTW-If I go this route, there will be a good velcro-attached skylight 
     screen/cover available, but don't be tempted to tell me a fib just to 
     get it.
