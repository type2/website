Subject: VW nicknames/types/abbreviations

&gt;&gt;Can I ask that this thread be extended a bit?  I would love a glossary of
&gt;&gt;some of the terms used here.  For instance, I assume a Devon is a
&gt;&gt;Westfalia in England, but until Thom said &quot;no, no&quot; I always assumed that
&gt;&gt;&quot;barn doors&quot; were the double side doors that opened out from the center on
&gt;&gt;busses thru '67.

I second this idea.  I still don't know what a Kombi is (yes, you may all
gasp at my ignorance).  How about it?  Can someone type up a dictionary for
us VW novices?  What are the different engine types?  body types?  What is
that pesky EGR box anyway? etc....
