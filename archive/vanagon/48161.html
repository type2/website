Subject: Re:'91 Westy FS Phx (Wheels)

Tom Forham mentioned:
Hmmm. Stock wheels for a US version 91 Westie are the alloy ones... 

ellis blurts:
The Westy in the last post definitely didn't have the kew~el looking alloys.
The fugly plastic wheel covers looked as &quot;good&quot; as they (n)ever did. The
sales schmoe actually quoted a $21,900.00 price and I literally laughed in
his face and made the Mr.Manager man who was sitting in the adjacent office
look up at me and glare. =)
It took ONE second after I exclaimed that it was &quot;a whole *BUNCH* of
cabbage&quot; that he stah-stah-stammmmmmered that &quot;well you can tell the list
$19,900.00 as that was the price that we had it marked down to at one time
for a sale. They are rare you know!!&quot; he proudly announced. &quot;Yeah, I
know...&quot; I told him, &quot;I see them for sale all over the internet all the time
and for THOUSANDS less!&quot; (  heh heh heh~you hoser  ) I didn't mention that
they might have a hunnert thouzint more miles on em though...

I had to correct the &quot;sales associate&quot; on a couple of points. He asked me
&quot;Wasn't it '92 that they started with the Winnebago versions?&quot; I mumbled
about the Eurovan front wheel drive versions with the Winnie trimmings vs
the mondo 'spensive big ol' Winnies in '95 or '96 vs the Vanagon westy
versions. He didn't know when the vanagons went to Wasserboxers. Hmmm...
&quot;I'll be in touch I told him.&quot; (not).
Hell, for twenty grand I could *almost* finish the Resto from Hell! =)
