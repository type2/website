Subject: good ole' Chevron Techron

All-
I had a few extra bucks this week in my pocket, so I sprung for a bottle
of Chevron Techron.  It was the 1st time I've ever used it in my 79 bus.
I drove with it in a full tank, then refilled again today for the 2nd time
since using it.  I thought I'd let you all know my city mpg has jumped up to 
*25*.  Before using the Techron, driving in stop/go traffic, I would
only get 17 mpg.  I wonder what I get on the highway now? ;)
I don't really notice any better performance, but the fuel economy
has gotten MUCH better, wouldn't you say!
Take Care
Paul
