          Finally, the rebuilt 1600SP arrived yesterday a.m. and now
          sits in the cargo bay of our beloved '66 kombi/camper.  I
          will begin the surgery tomorrow after work, dropping in the
          fuel pump, distributor, assembling tins, carb, manifold, etc
          and then hope to tie it all in on saturday.  I will of
          course take photos and try to get them scanned on the web.
          At least I'll report back after the beast has roared once
          again.  Last night I opened the engine hatch and stood back
          to make a photo of the empty, but clean, compartment.  It
          reminded me of looking at Uncle Wally's photos of his chest
          cavity taken during his heart transplant, after the bad
          heart came out and before the good one was dropped in.  Made
          me woozy and I had to sit.  Maybe it was the leftover gunk
          fumes.  Wish me luck.  The motor sure is pretty!   ray
