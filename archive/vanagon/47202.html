I concur with Clara. I've never been harassed going into Canada, but more 
often than not I have been hassled coming back into the USA. Also, do not 
carry any fruit or vegetables across the border. After my two week trip to 
the Canadian Rockies last month, I had a couple of mushy bananas in the 
fridge that I had forgotten about. US customs searched me and found the 
bananas and got really pissed off. When I tried to apologize and say I 
forgot I had them, the customs agent got a real stern look on his face and 
said &quot;Have you ever seen crop devastation?&quot; I was told I could have been 
fined $250, but they let me off. As far as controlled substances, don't 
even think about it. They will take your beloved bus and you'll be lucky if 
you ever see it again. Several years back when Operation Zero Tolerance was 
in full swing, they confiscated an 18 wheeler for cigarette papers. No lie, 
I read about this in the newspapers.
