Subject: Re: How do I stop this oil leak?

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I've got a pretty steady oil leak dripping off the little nuts 
&gt;&gt; surrounding the oil drain plug on my '71. I've replaced the paper 
&gt;&gt; gaskets, the brass washers, the little nuts and even the entire round 
&gt;&gt; metal plate with no success. How the hell do I stop this thing?!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Try Permatex Ultra blue or ultra copper in conjunction with the paper
gasket.  Use Permatex teflon thread sealer on the threaded parts and wait 24
hours after application to put in the oil or start it up.

Second this opinion on the Ultra Blue, the waiting 24 hrs to fill it, and
the thorough cleaning someone else mentioned.  Also, you may need to flatten
back with a hammer the parts where the nuts have previously squished the
plate, if they're really squished, it'll never seal right.
