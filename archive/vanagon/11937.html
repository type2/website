&gt;&gt;&gt;How can I tell if the input shaft is very slightly bent?  Wouldn't there be
&gt;
&gt;&gt;With the engine out, jack up one wheel and turn that wheel.  The trans shaft 
&gt;&gt;will turn,  anrd will wobble if bent.
&gt;
&gt;Obviously! But what if is just very slightly bent?  I did turn the wheel,
&gt;and I didn't notice any pronounced wobble.  Such a wobble would make the
&gt;car almost undriveable, right?  But a VERY SLIGHT bend might go unnoticed,
&gt;and would create stresses that cause mechanisms like a clutch to fail
&gt;prematurely.

Sorry, sure it's obivous.  If you can't see it when ya look at it real hard, 
I don't think it's your problem.  But the next step would to put a dial 
indicator on it and watch.  
That's probabally obvious too.
