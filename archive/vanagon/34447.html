&gt;&gt;Hi Justin,
&gt;&gt;   Was reading your post questions about diesels and thought I might add my
&gt;&gt;$0.02 worth.
&gt;&gt;   First, yes, Vanagon diesels are just like a rabbit diesel, most of the
&gt;&gt;parts are interchangeable.  They came with a 1.6L and were offer from
&gt;&gt;'81-'83. In 83 you could get a vanagon with an air-cooled motor, diesel or
&gt;&gt;the new water-cooled flat-4 1.9L engine. Yes, they are slow, the engine
&gt;&gt;only produces 48hp. The trans is geared much like a split window bus.  But
&gt;&gt;they get great fuel mileage, average about 30mpg. Most parts are still
&gt;&gt;available, and are not to expensive.
&gt;&gt;    When I bought my Westy diesel the engine was shot. The bearings had
&gt;&gt;worn out do to antifreeze in the oil and lack of oil pressure.  I had the
&gt;&gt;choice of either rebuilding the diesel, with new crank and rods to match,
&gt;&gt;or replaced the diesel with a used gas rabbit motor.  I went with the gas
&gt;&gt;motor. It was cheaper, and at the time I didn't have a lot of time to do a
&gt;&gt;complete overhaul. Besides, I heard that it could be done and I'm a sucker
&gt;&gt;for trying new things. So far the motor has been great. Right now I having
&gt;&gt;problems with the fuel injection. But baring that I think that the gas
&gt;&gt;motor has been a good choice. Anyway, the diesel, is a good motor, maybe
&gt;&gt;slow but it's reliablity and relatively cheap to maintain makes it a good
&gt;&gt;choice in my opinon.  If you do decide to get a diesel vanagon you could
&gt;&gt;always do a gas transplant. In line-4 water cooled motors are quite
&gt;&gt;plentiful in the salvage yards. I hope this answers your questions.  Good
&gt;&gt;luck finding one.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Hello Jim,
&gt;Did you convert the fuel system over to that of a gas vehicle or are you
&gt;driving an improperly vented,  non vapor revcovery,  emmision illegal time
&gt;bomb. Although I see the benifits of this conversion, this last step should
&gt;not be over looked.  Just thought I'd enter some fuel for thought.

&gt;
&gt;Your diesel is equipped with an oil to water oil cooler.  These often fail
&gt;internally and allow the oil into the cooling system  This is usual cause of
&gt;this condition.  Check this thouroughly before condeming engine or head or
&gt;head gasket.  2.1L vanagons have same stupid set-up.

&gt;&gt;Hi folks, I'm still off the list, but in need of advice.  Tonight's minus 15
&gt;
&gt;&gt;(or so) Minneapolis weather seems to have taken the life of my clutch ('84 
&gt;&gt;Vanagon).  There is no resistance at all when I depress the pedal.  Once 
&gt;&gt;during the past two evenings, I noticed my clutch seemed to be partially 
&gt;&gt;frozen.  I got some resitance only when I pressed the pedal much farther 
&gt;&gt;down than it usually seem to begin to catch (did that make sense).  So it 
&gt;&gt;may be frozen: I usually put it in gear after I've turned it off, so the 
&gt;&gt;last thing I did was depress the clutch pedal to park it.  I just rolled 
&gt;&gt;over 100,000 miles, so it could have snapped too.    I'm wondering if anyone
&gt;
&gt;&gt;on the Vanagon list has experienced subzero effects on their Vanagon clutch,
&gt;
&gt;&gt;or any other part of the beast.  Since I'm off the list, please respond 
&gt;&gt;directly....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks in advance, and happy winter!
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like clutch master or slave cylinder lost fluid.  Cold weather
&gt;contribted but not complete cause.  Look for brake fluid leaks. See Bentley
&gt;manual for details.

&gt;&gt;After 170,000 miles it is now time to replace the liquid puncher.  I 
&gt;&gt;have been quoted about $2350 for a factory 1.9 longblock.  It seems that 
&gt;&gt;installation can run up to $1200.  This seems sort of high for the 
&gt;&gt;installation labor.  (of course this is dealer labor rates.)  What is a 
&gt;&gt;reasonable cost for replacement??  Question #2:Can a 2.1 be substituted, 
&gt;&gt;or were there too many changes in '86.  Thanks for any input.
&gt;
&gt;I would stronly recomend a 2.1.  If buying a long block, it is a direct fit
&gt;and your FI will support it. I've done this many times.  I would look to find
&gt;a good used one complete with the exhaust.  The cooling system in the Van can
&gt;be upgraded to the later style if you have all the pieces.  The later system
&gt;works better due to some flow improvements.  Less susceptible to air in the
&gt;syetm, easier to bleed.  E-mail me if you need any frther info.  I can also
&gt;help you get an engine.

&gt;Boxer? From boxing? Absolutely!
&gt;
&gt;I used to be a technical translator in Berlin (if you see any German 
&gt;construction equipment, I probably wrote the manual. Scary, huh?); I think the 
&gt;boxer=boxing version makes a lot of sense because &quot;boxen&quot; means (in German)
&gt;
&gt;a) speakers ('geile Boxen, wa?')
&gt;b) the pit (as in car racing)
&gt;c) to box, as in boxing, the sport
&gt;
&gt;Since &quot;Boxer&quot; means (in German) either a boxer (the guy who punches people) or 
&gt;a horizontally opposed engine, I think the derivation is right on. My .02. 
&gt;BTW, if anyone has any VW translation questions (names of parts, etc.) I can 
&gt;try my best.

&gt;I saw that idea in a magazine review... sounds contrived and farfetched,
&gt;to say the least. The word comes from the German language, doesn't it?
&gt;Probably bears no resemblence to the English definition...

&gt;
&gt;Hogwash, 'Boxer' refers to the cantankerous nature of these engines and the 
&gt;fact that their intrinsic behaviour can be revolting at times.  I 
&gt;respectfully submit that these engines were named after the famous 'Boxer 
&gt;Rebellion' in China, a much larger scale punch-up than a couple of brawling

&gt;What I got out of Charlie Brown's response was that he sold you a used part,

&gt;probably what the part cost him to begin with.  Mark up a nice profit for

&gt;
&gt;Jim,
&gt;
&gt;The only truly reusable filter is an oil-bath type, and even that requires
&gt;the coir baffle to be washed with kerosene from time to time, the oil bath
&gt;changed and so forth.  Filters of treated paper are almost as good at
&gt;trapping small particles as an oil bath.  Once trapped, they are discarded.
&gt; 'Reusable' filters that do not include some disposable element for trapping
&gt;fine particles are suspect, since the particles you want to worry about are
&gt;too small to be removed by conventional cleaning methods.  
&gt;
&gt;Oil bath air filters are based on a fundamental principle of physics, wherein
&gt;the greater mass of any particulate matter, as compared to the mass of a
&gt;molecule of air, prevents the particle from negotiating the sharp bend
&gt;introduced in the air stream, causing the particle to collide with the pool
&gt;of oil and become trapped.  
&gt;
&gt;Paper, cloth or other filters are based on the labyrinth principle.  In
&gt;tests, oil-bath (or water, for large stationary engines) have proven to be
&gt;more efficient, albeit larger and messier and requiring more maintenance.
&gt;
&gt;Off-roaders use paper filters only because oil-bath types do not stand up to
&gt;the jolts.  Military 'off-road' equipment such as tanks (!) use a combination
&gt;of centrifugal and labyrinth principles.  The centrifugal filters are either
&gt;active (ie, consuming power) or passive, using ducts and vanes to create a
&gt;vortex in the air-flow.  Labyrinth filters usually have a reusable outer
&gt;filter and a disposable inner filter, the former for coarse material, the
&gt;later for fine.
&gt;
&gt;Your Volkswagen's oil bath air cleaner may look clunky and out of date, but
&gt;if properly maintained it does a better job protecting your engine than a
&gt;paper air filter.

&gt;
&gt;The vanagon Syncro uses the passive centrifugal setup in conjunction with a 
&gt;'normal usage' (cheap) or 'dusty usage' ($$) disposable paper filter.  Nice 
&gt;to lift out the centrifugal trap and pour a small handful of fine powdery 
&gt;silt out. And I just drive dusty logging roads, no Baja!  The unit can be 
&gt;retrofitted to any vanagon, it includes a 'snorkle' that goes way up the 
&gt;side vent duct to get above the dust a bit.  BFG's Baja Commanders, better

&gt;I have been carrying this in my pocket for 3 days and dreaming
&gt;
&gt;Ad as follows:VW WESTFALIA '78: 2000cc, propane stove, pop-top, sleeps 4,

&gt;excl cond., $3900.
&gt;
&gt;I have been lurking on the list for a few days. My teenager totalled my
&gt;1987 toyota van I had for 9 years and me and the kids are currently riding
&gt;the bus. I could handle all the basic repairs and maintenance on my old
&gt;van.
&gt;But as a recent single parent now w/kids will this be a good investment or
&gt;I guess what I really need vs. want is a car big enough for 5 people and a
&gt;VW van for the beach and weekends.
&gt;With a factory manual would I be able to take care of repairs without too
&gt;much expense. My brother is a german car specialist, lives 3 hrs away but
&gt;at least parts are available at a discount.
&gt;Yes, I asked him but he says it is my van; my decision

&gt;Depending on mileage what is a fair counter offer range for a '78?

&gt;Exactly! BTW, back in my other life when I owned my '70 bus, I didn't do

&gt;20,000 mile engines, they got some repeat business. They could always

&gt;Sounds steep,  but I wouldn't rule it out. A '71 in top shape is a great

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Over the past year (yes, it is an obsession) I've been 
&gt;&gt;shopping for a Eurovan. While I know VW dealers are going to 
&gt;&gt;be more than non-VW dealers, and dealers in general are more 
&gt;&gt;expensive than individuals, it seems the Eurovans command 
&gt;&gt;premium prices beyond blue book and competing vans' prices.
&gt;
&gt;I have found the same thing, been looking for 4 months.
&gt;Found a nice 86' Westy with 69K no rust but leaky heads
&gt;poor brakes, rusted cat &amp; muff, needs struts. 
&gt;On a non-VW new car dealers lot. My mechanic said it 
&gt;would need a lot of work.  Dealer wants $5995 as-is.  
&gt;
&gt;Book price is approx. $2100 retail, $1600 wholesale.  
&gt;But when I look at E-Page Internet Classified AD's
&gt;(http://ep_dot_com:80/h/epages.html) I see that the $6K is in the 
&gt;ballpark.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Know that I would have to drop about $2500 to get it into 
&gt;reliable shape.  
&gt;
&gt;What is it worth?  $2500 to $3000 ????

&gt;	The best VW magazine you can get is called VolksWorld
&gt;	and it comes out monthly here in the U.K.
&gt;	Subscription for overseas is 52.50 U.K. pounds for

&gt;	I think its a more refined and knowlageable magazine

&gt;Hi, Brett--
&gt;Hot VWs and VW Trends cater to all kinds of VWs, and I think it would be 
&gt;rare to find something pertaining to 70s era Westies in them. As far as 
&gt;all-model VW magazines go, Ben is right is saying Volksworld may be 
&gt;better (some bigger news stands will have it in stock). If you can read 
&gt;French, my favorite is Super VW Magazine, edited by Jacky Morel. Also sort 
&gt;of hard to find, but has amazing photos and great layout.
&gt;
&gt;But, the top o' the heap for relevance to a '77 Westy would be LiMBO's 
&gt;&quot;The Transporter.&quot; LiMBO is a club for owners and admirers of '68 to the 
&gt;present VW vans of all years (Jim DiGennaro: does this include Sharans?)
&gt;Their newsletter is 6 times a year. Jim D. in on the List, and I'm sure 
&gt;he'll get in touch with you about how to join/subscribe.

&gt;
&gt;With the stats being published today, it reminded me that lurkers on the
&gt;list are kind of like groundhogs. That is, they're seldom seen. Every now
&gt;and then, one pokes its head out from under the bus, hoping to get
&gt;attention, in part by proclaiming &quot;Hey, look at me! I'm one of your
&gt;lurkers! Pay attention!&quot; 
&gt;
&gt;We hear about groundhogs once a year. Partly in jest, partly in hope-
&gt;against-hope, we look to them to predict how much longer winter will last. 
&gt;
&gt;I wonder why we don't have a Lurkers Day. We could watch for lurkers to
&gt;poke their heads out of their holes and if one sees it's shadow, we'd know
&gt;the network connection would be up for another day (that is, for all of
&gt;us but Tom Forhan, of course). Or, if a lurker came out of hiding with a
&gt;question that was kindof new to the list, we'd know our buses would run
&gt;trouble-free for the rest of the week! 
&gt;
&gt;Groundhogs are fat, furry, and shy. They're cute and we like them. I 
&gt;think most of the vanagon list members like lurkers too. I know I do; 
&gt;without them, who would I tease today?

&gt;&gt;From the January/February 1996 VW Autoist:
&gt;
&gt;     &quot;The Frankfurt Auto Show revealed two concepts
&gt;     from Volkswagen.  With its new minivan (VW
&gt;     Sharan-Seat Alhambra) now in the showrooms, VW
&gt;     revealed its Noah.
&gt;
&gt;     The small van features a single central door on
&gt;     either side; both driver and passengers enter in
&gt;     the middle of the vehicle.  The doors swing up
&gt;     into the roof, but they are not just giant
&gt;     gullwings...&quot;
&gt;
&gt;It is described as 40 cubits by 60 cubits by 100 cubits, so
&gt;prepare for 40 days and 40 nights of rain.  OK, males to the

&gt;Yes, but does it FLOAT?

&gt;   
&gt;COMPUTERS &amp; ELECTRONICS (as depicted in movies) 
&gt;=====================================================
&gt;     
&gt;Word processors never display a cursor.
&gt;     
&gt;You never have to use the space-bar when typing long sentences.
&gt;     
&gt;All monitors display inch-high letters.
&gt;     
&gt;High-tech computers, such as those used by NASA, the CIA, or some 
&gt;such governmental institution, will have easy to understand 
&gt;graphical interfaces. Those that don't, have incredibly powerful 
&gt;text-based command shells that can correctly understand and 
&gt;execute commands typed in plain English.
&gt;     
&gt;Corollary: you can gain access to any information you want by 
&gt;simply typing &quot;ACCESS ALL OF THE SECRET FILES&quot; on any keyboard.
&gt;     
&gt;Likewise, you can infect a computer with a destructive virus by 
&gt;simply typing &quot;UPLOAD VIRUS&quot; (see Fortress).
&gt;     
&gt;All computers are connected.  You can access the information on 
&gt;the villain's desktop computer, even if it's turned off.
&gt;     
&gt;Powerful computers beep whenever you press a key or whenever the 
&gt;screen changes.  Some computers also slow down the output on the 
&gt;screen so that it doesn't go faster than you can read.  The *really* 
&gt;advanced ones also emulate the sound of a dot-matrix printer. [See 
&gt;The Hunt For Red October or Alien]
&gt;     
&gt;All computer panels have thousands of volts and flash pots just 
&gt;underneath the surface.  Malfunctions are indicated by a bright 
&gt;flash, a puff of smoke, a shower of sparks, and an explosion that 
&gt;forces you backwards.
&gt;     
&gt;People typing away on a computer will turn it off without saving 
&gt;the data.  [See the opening credits for The Hunt For Red October]
&gt;     
&gt;A hacker can get into the most sensitive computer in the world 
&gt;before intermission and guess the secret password in two tries.
&gt;     
&gt;Any PERMISSION DENIED has an OVERRIDE function (see Demolition 
&gt;Man and countless others).
&gt;     
&gt;Complex calculations and loading of huge amounts of data will be 
&gt;accomplished in under three seconds.  Movie modems usually appear 
&gt;to transmit data at the speed of two gigabytes per second.
&gt;     
&gt;When the power plant/missile site/whatever overheats, all the 
&gt;control panels will explode, as will the entire building.
&gt;     
&gt;If a disk has got encrypted files, you are automatically asked 
&gt;for a password when you try to access it.
&gt;     
&gt;No matter what kind of computer disk it is, it'll be readable by 
&gt;any system you put it into. All application software is usable by 
&gt;all computer platforms.
&gt;     
&gt;The more high-tech the equipment, the more buttons it has (Aliens). 
&gt;However, everyone must have been highly trained, because the buttons 
&gt;aren't labelled.
&gt;     
&gt;Most computers, no matter how small, have reality-defying three- 
&gt;dimensional,active animation, photo-realistic graphics capability.

&gt;Hey:
&gt;
&gt;Well someone broke in the Vanagon and took the passanger side vent 
&gt;(triangle) window out to do it. VW no longer sells the &quot;kit&quot; just the 
&gt;glass. I still have all the parts, clasp, etc. but they want $54 for 
&gt;the glass and another $70 to install. So... my question is, the 
&gt;assembly seems straight forward.
&gt;However, the clasp used to secure the window, I can't seem to find 
&gt;out how to remove the backing so that I can reinsert it through the 
&gt;new window hole. Any suggestions? Also, there seems to be some glue 
&gt;on the window at the pivot points?

&gt;&gt;  There is a switch between the push rod tubes on the drivers

&gt;&gt;below 2000 rpm.  The other switch is below the water pump, (impossible to

&gt;&gt;at). It is normally closed, held open by good oil pressure. This switch is

&gt;
&gt;Dennis &amp; all,
&gt;The above is not correct about the &quot;normal&quot; position of the 0.9bar switch.
&gt;
&gt;The dynamic oil pressure monitoring system gets inputs from two pressure
&gt;switches.  One switch is closed with no oil pressure and opens when oil
&gt;pressure rises to about 0.3 bar, called the .3 bar switch.  The .3 bar switch
&gt;is located between the left (driver's side) two cylinders.
&gt;The other switch is open with no oil pressure and closes when oil pressure
&gt;rises to about 0.9 bar, thus called the .9 bar switch.  The .9 bar switch is
&gt;located below the water pump &amp; crank pulley, near the oil pump.
&gt;
&gt;I hopes this helps to clarify.

&gt;If you can measure and find the perfect thickness, have a glass shop custom 
&gt;cut a piece of tempered for you... this worked great on my Superbeetle 
&gt;'vert, and saved me a couple hundred bucks (the beetle glass ONLY comes as a 
&gt;kit, thereby selling you ever part associated). Make sure you have the

&gt;&gt;Hmmm. I remember seeing some TV program a few years ago about some

&gt;&gt;(obviously no gaps in it though). He stood inside and walked and 
&gt;&gt;walked and walked....and the thing slowly bobbed its way across the 
&gt;&gt;water. (Dunno if he made it though).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Surely all you need is a scaled up version, and you could *drive* your

&gt;
&gt;And if this paddlewheel device was inflatable, then when you got
&gt;across little puddle, you could fold it up, stash it in the back, and
&gt;drive straight on to the bigger puddle!  Need a few extra gas tanks,
&gt;though, to get across either puddle.
&gt;
&gt;And if you and your friends drove this trip in beetles, you could

&gt;
&gt;Dear Sirs:
&gt;
&gt;  I am writing in response to your 
&gt;request for additional information.  In 
&gt;block number 3 of the accident reporting
&gt;form, I put &quot;trying to do the job
&gt;alone&quot; as the cause of my accident.  You
&gt;said in your letter that I should explain
&gt;more fully, and I trust that the following
&gt;details will be sufficient.
&gt;
&gt;  I am a bricklayer by trade.  On the day 
&gt;of the accident, I was working alone on
&gt;the roof of a new six-story building.
&gt;When I completed my work, I discovered
&gt;that I had about 500 pounds of
&gt;brick left over.  Rather than carry the
&gt;bricks down by hand, I decided to lower
&gt;them in a barrel by using a pully which
&gt;fortunately was attached to the side of 
&gt;the building at the sixth floor.
&gt;
&gt;  Securing the rope at ground level, I
&gt;went up to the roof, swung the barrel
&gt;out, and loaded the brick into it.  Then I
&gt;went back to the ground floor and 
&gt;untied, holding it tightly to 
&gt;insure a slow descent of the 500 pounds
&gt;of brick.  You will note in block number
&gt;11 of the accident reporting form that I
&gt;weigh 145 pounds.
&gt;
&gt;  Due to my suprise at being jerked off
&gt;the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence
&gt;of mind and forgot to let go of the
&gt;rope.  Needless to say, I proceeded at a
&gt;rapid rate up the side of the building.
&gt;
&gt;  In the vicinity of the third floor, I met
&gt;the barrel coming down.  This explains
&gt;the fractured skull and broken collarbone.
&gt;
&gt;  Slowed only slightly, I continued my 
&gt;rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers
&gt;of my hand were two knuckles deep
&gt;into the pulley.  Fortunately, by this time
&gt;I had regained my presence of mind and
&gt;was able to hold tightly to the rope in
&gt;spite of my pain.
&gt;
&gt;  At approximately the same time,
&gt;however, the barrel of bricks hit the 
&gt;ground, and the bottom fell out of the
&gt;barrel.  Devoid of the weight of the
&gt;bricks, the barrel now weighed approximately
&gt;50 pounds.
&gt;
&gt;  I refer you again to my weight in 
&gt;block number 11.  As you might
&gt;imagine, I began a rapid descent down
&gt;the side of the building.
&gt;
&gt;  In the vicinity of the third floor, I met
&gt;the barrell coming up.  This accounts for
&gt;the two fractured ankles and the lacerations
&gt;on my legs and lower body.
&gt;
&gt;  The encounter with the barrel slowed
&gt;me enough to lessen my injuries when I
&gt;fell onto the pile of bricks and, fortunately,
&gt;only three vertebrae were cracked.
&gt;
&gt;  I am sorry to report, however, that as
&gt;I lay there on the bricks, in pain, unable
&gt;to stand, and watching the empty barrell 
&gt;above me, I again lost my presence of 
&gt;minde -- and I let go of the rope.  The
&gt;empty barrel weighed more than the
&gt;rope so it came back down on me and
&gt;broke both my legs.
&gt;
&gt;  I hope I have furnished the information
&gt;you require as to how the accident
&gt;occured.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; from: a Newbie
&gt;&gt; I have been carrying this in my pocket for 3 days and
&gt;&gt; dreaming
&gt;
&gt;Stop dreaming and call.  Nothing to lose by looking, poking
&gt;and proding.  Look at the bus, then you can give us more
&gt;details.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ad as follows:VW WESTFALIA '78: 2000cc, propane stove,
&gt;&gt; pop-top, sleeps 4, sink, new tires, new battery, new
&gt;&gt; brakes,runs great, pullout am/fm cass.  excl cond., $3900.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have been lurking on the list for a few days. My teenager
&gt;&gt; totalled my 1987 toyota van I had for 9 years and me and the
&gt;&gt; kids are currently riding the bus. I could handle all the
&gt;&gt; basic repairs and maintenance on my old van.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to hear about the wheels, hope the teenager is OK.  If
&gt;you're brave enough to deal with the '87 Toyota, you should
&gt;be in good shape for a '78 VW.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; But as a recent single parent now w/kids will this be a good
&gt;&gt; investment or I guess what I really need vs. want is a car
&gt;&gt; big enough for 5 people and a VW van for the beach and
&gt;&gt; weekends.
&gt;
&gt;The &quot;big enough for 5 people&quot; is easy, but what goes on at
&gt;the beach and on weekends?  Are you looking at Westy because
&gt;you want to camp on weekends?  If you don't plan, have
&gt;enough money, have enough time, to do mucho camping the
&gt;Westy may be overkill.  If the Westy is a cherry, and the
&gt;price is right, it will serve your weekday needs and your
&gt;weekend needs.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; With a factory manual would I be able to take care of
&gt;&gt; repairs without too much expense. My brother is a german car
&gt;&gt; specialist, lives 3 hrs away but at least parts are
&gt;&gt; available at a discount.
&gt;
&gt;Always helps to have some connections and it would be wise
&gt;to have your brother look at the vehicle to counter the
&gt;emotional &quot;I want it, I want it&quot; that most prospective VW
&gt;buyers suffer.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, I asked him but he says it is my van; my decision
&gt;
&gt;Yeh, your decision, but he can help it be an informed
&gt;decision, can't he?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Depending on mileage what is a fair counter offer range for
&gt;&gt; a '78?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Patty
&gt;
&gt;You've come to the right place....this list.  I have more
&gt;experience with splitties than bay-windows so I'm no expert
&gt;on pricing a '78.  I will check my &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot;
&gt;for some ball-park values while I'm home at lunch.  Weakly
&gt;stats show 15 people on-list with '78s, any points of
&gt;comparison out there, folks?

&gt;Sitting there brain dead on Friday night? Me too. Sonambulating into Saturday?
&gt;Thought you might like to share some little Splitty ditties we published a
&gt;while back.....
&gt;There once was a Splitty called Bill
&gt;Whose engine was chronically ill
&gt;Its pistons had popped
&gt;Its valves had dropped
&gt;and its big ends were over the hill
&gt;
&gt;Pablo was a Split Screen van
&gt;His owner was a &quot;charming&quot; man
&gt;One day his pet mamba
&gt;Slipped off in his Samba
&gt;And hissed &quot;why doesn't this one end in a rhyme?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;And after a day of deconstructuralism thats about all I can cope with.
&gt;Remember what the dormouse said....

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Depending on mileage what is a fair counter offer range for
&gt;&gt; a '78?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Patty
&gt;
&gt;Old Cars Price Guide (December 1995) puts a '78 &quot;Campmobile&quot;
&gt;at $2400 for Good and $4800 for Very Good conditions.  Very
&gt;Good is a &quot;20-footer&quot; meaning it looks perfect from 20 feet
&gt;away, but wear is obvious upon closer inspection.
&gt;
&gt;Just a point of reference....

&gt;
&gt;&gt; 20*(he may not have been that specific).Hence this question: Wouldn't that be
&gt;&gt; a good thing rather than bad if it means that the oil is &quot;transfering&quot; 10%
&gt;&gt; more heat(10* -20*) from the interior of the engine to the cooler?
&gt;&gt; I'll admit upfront that this is strictly an academic exercise for me since I
&gt;&gt; have very little understanding of things mechanical but do enjoy hearing the
&gt;&gt; &quot;pros&quot; hash one out.
&gt;
&gt;As I understand it, the synthetic stuff sheds heat better.  That's 
&gt;great and all, but that means that more heat is being transferred 
&gt;into the engine case.  Not what we want.  We want the heat in the oil 
&gt;until it goes to the cooler which then effectively cools the oil.  
&gt;Sure the synthetic stuff would cool better in the oil cooler, but I 
&gt;don't want the heat in the case.
&gt;
&gt;Again, this is based on what I've been told, and some random logic 
&gt;(combined in no particular order!).

&gt;Hell, better call the Smithsonian!  I'm sure they'd be interested in

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; to help check it out, I can check compression &amp; what not, but are there any
&gt;&gt; specific things to look for on a 80? Are the compression readings different
&gt;&gt; from the uprights? Thanks in advance for any info (will search archives
&gt;&gt; later).
