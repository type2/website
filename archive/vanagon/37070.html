Subject: Another Bus adventure!!!

Howdy all. Those of you old faithful might recall last summer when fellow
listmember Kevin Murray and I swapped busses. I traded him my '66 Sunroof
Deluxe for a '65 single cab. Since then, I discovered the insidious
rust-monster was eating away at my trusty '67 camper, and the damage was more
than I had thought.
  So, I sold my sweetie bus, in super running shape, to a friend, after
purchasing a clean-bodied '67 camper. That camper supposedly ran, but had been
sitting for 14 years. Upon tearing down the engine, we discovered that the case
was trashed, and had already been bored out to the limit.
  Turning to you, my faithful listvolk, for help, I got into contact with Kevin
again, who offered a brand new 1600 SP, in a fresh AS41 case, which was just
what the doctor ordered. The only problem being that he is in Florida, and I in
North Carolina. Well, since he had driven the truck to me last time, it was my
turn to do the driving this time.
  So, tomorrow, (Friday), while all you are discussing humorus things like
busses and gun control, I'll be truckin' on down to Florida, where we'll put
the new engine in a different camper he has. We'll then completely redo the
brakes, and handle whatever other tweakings need to be made, before I turn
around and head back here, hopefully in time for work. Whew!
  So anyway, send good thoughts/prayers/vibes this way, please, and keep an eye
out for a full report when it all is over!
  Also, I will have a '67 walk-through camper for sale (no engine) next week,
so if anyone is interested, I can send details, when I figure out which one I'm
selling.
  Also also, THere are still plenty more list stickers available.
 I may do another batch of t-shirts in another month, or I may do a special
Split-window t-shirt.
Ok, I think that's it...
