&gt;I've got an '87 Vanagon that lights and buzzes its oil indicators until it 
&gt;warms up (which can be quite a long time this winter in the northeast.) 
&gt;Someone told me to use an original VW oil filter to solve the problem. This 
&gt;worked...for about one day. Any ideas???

This condition can be caused by several things:

1. Bad oil pressure monitoring system circuit (located in speedometer).
2. Bad oil pressure switch(es).  Your Vanagon has two of them.
3. Low oil pressure (Probably the most likely cause)
    A. Bad oil filter (since you've changed it, this isn't likely the cause)
    B. Oil pressure relief valve needs adjustment or replacement
    C.  Worn out engine

Have this checked out soon!  For your sake, I hope it's not 3-C.

Good luck
