Subject: Cool Yellow Headlights

This may seem too dumb for the computer age, but a cheaper fix is to buy
a cheap pair of yellow-lens glasses.  Bought a pair at a swap meet
recently, &amp; wear 'em at night, some, when looking stoopid is less of a
worry than seeing.  They do seem to help.  See, I'm mid 40s, and age is
toying w/my eyes.  Of course, the van is slow enough that I have time to
react.  Now, on my motorcycle, it's a different story.
