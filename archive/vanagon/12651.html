So Peter Williams says:
&gt; 
&gt; Where does the coil go?  I seem to remember that it mounts on the fan
&gt; housing somehow, but I'm not really quite sure where or how.  Is there a
&gt; mounting bracket for the coil?

Yes there's a metal bracket that screws with one or two bolts into the
left top side of the fan housing.  Check your leftover parts pile. ;)
There should be a little piece of metal that has an opening that the
coil can slide through.
