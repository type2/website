&gt;Calm down.  You were not being flamed!  We are merely commenting on
&gt;the claim of the advertiser that he has some rare item, which really isn't
&gt;so rare.   Its kinda like talking back to the TV (television, not transvestite-
&gt;dad would slap me for talking back)

I thank whomever it was that sent that info on the busses that has now
become such a controversial issue.  I couldn't say it (above) better.
