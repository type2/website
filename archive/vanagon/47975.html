Joel et al: 
 
Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, etc, etc, etc.....  
 
Sorry, didn't realize I was kurking. 
 
Was a &quot;wanabus&quot; (last week when I first found this virtual campground), now a 
&quot;gottabus&quot; (yesterday). Our decesion was in no small part due to the kind and 
honest opinions of the many people in the group.  
 
Here are the stats: 1993 EV GL with 31,000 miles. Its maroon. It has those 
strange VW racing stripes down the side. It has a tan interior (these all seem 
to be inportant &quot;Car Talk&quot; stats, I don't know if it's relevant to all 
of you....). 
 
Haven't been on a road trip yet, but probably will in the next few weeks - 
maybe Arkansas, maybe Louisiana. 
 
Bought it through a dealer (Central VW in Richardson, TX - BTW they have a '93 
EV MV for sale - 32,000 miles +/-, 12/12 VW warranty, curtains, blue. Our sales 
person/man was Kermit Thompson and we liked him). Bought it with a VWoA bumper  
to bumper warranty (12/12).  
 
We live in Dallas, Texas (Big D), home of big hair, big make-up, big egos and 
big money. Hopefully, we do not embody for any of these traits, as we are New 
Orleans, Louisiana transplants (although the big money part wouldn't be too 
bad). 
 
We saw the van a few Sundays ago while on our way to a children's theater play. 
We were cruising up the freeway and it was parked in the used car lot at the 
dealership.  On a whim we stopped on our way home and peeked in through the 
windows.  Came back the next day and gave it a drive.  Spent the next week 
checking it out (thanks again to all who gave opinions, advice, warnings and 
who shared stories!).  Negotiated a deal last Wednesday and picked it up 
yesterday, all shiny and clean, with new tires and a new battery. 
 
We may be former wanabussers but we're VW lifers - grew up with a 
Beetle, Karman Ghia and Square Back.  We now own two (2) '91 Passats, a wagon 
and a sedan.  The rest of the family includes one (1) wife, one 
(1) little girl and one (1) Maine Coon cat. 
 
Hope this clears our name off the list.  Looking forward to giving and 
receiving more stories and advice. 
 
Regards,  
Chris L. Miller
