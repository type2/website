To: TYPE2_at_HOME.EASE.LSOFT.COM

After a couple of days of the ominous &quot;whoosh!&quot; sound from my brake
pedal -- had forgotten about that sound -- the pedal hit the metal last
night and there was NO braking whatsoever. Fortunately, I was going slow
and was able to avoid hitting anything or anyone. My impression is that,
after only a few pumps, there was suddenly zero brake fluid.  I thought
that, with the dual master cylinder, this was not supposed to happen
(also, isn't there a brake fluid warning light on the vanagon, as there
was on the ol' '68 bus?).
   Now, Mechanic #1 wants $1,300 to fix, saying needs totally new system
including two new front rotors, calipers, master cylinder, complete
rebuild all wheels.  Mechanic #2 is about to tell me the same (I
suspect, awaiting his call) and has said would thus fix for about
$800.00.  An odd thing is this: Brakes were strong, plenty of pedal and
no dragging sounds etc., up until about 3 days before pedal got squishy
and the whole thing suddenly went south.
    How can a whole system, seemingly healthy, collapse so fast and so
thoroughly?  You may consider this a rhetorical question...
    Cheers (&amp; sobs)...
