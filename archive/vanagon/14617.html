&gt; Sig for the day:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;And Saint Atila raised the hand grenade up on high,
&gt; saying, 'Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou
&gt; mayest blow thy enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'  And the Lord
&gt; did grin, and people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and
&gt; carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and
&gt; fruit bats, and large --&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Two points for him/her wot knows wot this came from...
