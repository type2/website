&gt;Dear fellow micro, bay, vanagon, and EV owners,
&gt;
&gt;This note is to (re) introduce myself to the vanagon list.  I am the 
&gt;proud owner of a slightly dilapidated 1970 Kombi which runs &amp; rides well 
&gt;but ain't the prettiest bus in the world.  I hail from Albuquerque, New 
&gt;Mexico, a fair enough place to live and generally kind to old VWs.  
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm, I guess that's it.  Howdy!

hey Joel... As long as you are at it... I have a '71 Westy, a '73 super
beetle and have just this week aqwuired a FREE  '69 Panel (camper
converted).  seems as there are still good people in this world( at least on
the Vanagon list:)).  Jim Kirk of Indianapolis gave me his parts bus for the
price of some misc. parts and trailering it away.  BTW he brews some of the
best hamebrew I've ever tasted.  Good Guy!
