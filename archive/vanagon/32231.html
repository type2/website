Subject: porsche tape ... gone to:
Date: Mon, 8 Jan 1996 10:52:30 -0500 (EST)

The tape goes to Thang Tran, from a nearby town.
Even though I suspect this guy may be a Gaytor fan (he's from 
Gainesville, Fla; what was that score again?  :-) ), I'm sending him the 
tape with the list of others who replied, in order:

Tobin Copley
Tim Smith
Bob Polys

Hope you enjoy it.

Mitch
