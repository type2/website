Subject: propane engine heaters

Hello people,

  I was looking through j.c. jipme and they sell a propane engine heater 
that is designed to keep yer coolant warm overnight.  Would this work to 
heat a bus if it were hooked up to a heater core?  The engine heater says 
it cranks out 5,000 BTU's.  Does anyone have one of these?  It's on page 
8 of the nov catalog.  What do you think?
