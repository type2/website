To David Schwarze
        I eventual got my copy of Haynes Air-cooled Transporters 79-82 so I can
        give you the spec. on the Solex 34 PDSIT. Sorry it took so long.
                Venturi diam.   26mm (1.02in)
                Main jet        135
                Air correction jet      140
                Pilot jet               50
                Pilot air jet           140
                Aux fuel jet            45
                Aux air jet             0.7

       Hope this is some use to you.

Can anybody tell me what the Venturi diameter is?

I have really enjoyed the Red Rock reports and must admit to being a lit bit 
envious of you guys being able to drive into the desert.  It brought back 
memories of when I visited  my then girlfriend, now wife ooh so many years ago 
in Riverside Ca. She took me out Mojave and I really enjoyed it. It was my first
visit to the states then and left lots of fond memories, clear blue skies (it was
around Christmas time), snow on the mountains and warm sun in the valleys.
I was living in Cologne, Germany at the time and had my first splittie, it was 
an olive green colour, maybe it was ex army, it seemed so small in comparison
to all the big US trucks.Fond memories. Maybe I'll try and get another one and 
turn back the clock. Although I like my vanagon the early models are that much
more compact, suits my 5' nothing statue a little better.

Maybe some of us people this side of the pond should organise some trips for
UK list members or is anything already organised. Are any of the UK folks on 
the list memebers of the VW Type II club?

Looking forward to more reports and the pics.

Cheers
