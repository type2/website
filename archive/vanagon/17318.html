Subject: Re: 

&gt;Chris -- do you have door handles in addition to the pull
&gt;straps, or just the straps?  Curious....

Uh ... I have a door thingy.  About 9&quot; long, horizontally mounted, a screw 
at either end.  I would call it a door handle, but I'm not sure about what 
you're calling a strap.

I think that the door ventalation Isn't there because we have the vents at 
the floor, behind the seats.  Like under the walk-thru.  At least I have 
them. :-)

Also curious.
