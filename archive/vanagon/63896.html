For the record,

Yes, I am listening. And, no, it won't fit. Now, I just have to remember to
take pictures. I did in the begining, but I've been a bit lax of late...
I'll get right on it...(aka: the check's in the mail).  The guy who's doing
this for me has been my VW mechanic for about 20 years. He owns the shop
and sometimes can't get away to do the work, hence, it's taking a while to
complete. Oh well...

&gt; Tom Czierniak replied first and gets to send me a box. Hope
&gt; it is useful to you Tom.
&gt; 
&gt; Tim and some others wondered:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; stamps with. Any idea if your pump would suit a newer TDi engine, since
&gt; &gt; that's the ideal diesel swap for me. 
&gt; 
&gt; No, I don't think it will. VW redesigned the intermediate shaft
&gt; drive for the vaccum pump. The oil pump is driven off the
&gt; intermediate shaft also, so I wouldn't have my hopes up
&gt; that a 1.6l pump fits a 1.9 (also true of the 1.9 IDI)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; PPS: nice web pages, see if you can talk Bob Bellanca (sp?) into
sending
&gt; &gt; you his TD installation photos for the rogues gallery.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Bob, are you listening? I'd be happy to host some pictures
&gt; of your 1.9l turbo diesel conversion.
