While the problem I had with a burning bus was not due to
an operating condition, I did fix the '56 so I would not get the
rubbing-on-the-tin-and-starting-a-fire problem.  I installed a 
pass-thru fitting on the firewall to the left of the motor. 
The when I pull the motor, I just clamp a small pair of vice 
grips on the line, and it doesn't leak.
