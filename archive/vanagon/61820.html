Subject: strainer help!

Hello volks, I usually hang around the type2 list but I am in serious
trouble and need your help. Please respond via pmail.

I have a 1973 VW westy with a stock 1.7L type IV engine.
Last night while changing the oil, I torqued the strainer bolt to tight.
it snapped!!

Is there anyway to remedy this situation without dismantling the engine.
Currently, I still have about 1/2&quot; of the stud protruding from the tube.

to describe the strainer, it has a single stud which passes throug the
plate and is held on by a single nute.

Please help. i am very desparate...and really bummed out.!

Brian
