Link pins and kings pins are in the same suspension.  The king
pin is the big one that goes up and down (actually angles in at
the top a little) and the link pins, uh, link the torsion
tubes to the king pin.  The link pins go side to side.  In
old buses (like ours) they need to be checked for every 3000
miles.  The ball joint susp. replaced this type of susp. in
1965 or so.
