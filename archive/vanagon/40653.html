&gt;One more air cooled  -  my friend had...
&gt;
&gt;-Honda, 2 cyl 500cc (like in motorbike), 4 seats

These were actually 600cc. They made a &quot;coupe&quot; and a &quot;sedan&quot;.
My brother owned several, and still has one on blocks. Many, many
parts saved.  It had a modified 450cc motorcycle &quot;DOHC&quot; engine.
The serpentine belt for the cooling fan is amazing - four pullies - with
two to take the belt 90 degrees out of the plane of the crank pully...

We seated 5 in a coupe once, on a food run, and we weren't all that
uncomfortable.
