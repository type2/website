Subject: Re: Tires &amp; Wheels for '89 Vanagon

I have a '73 Camper and your Vanagon and my Bus have the same bolt pattern
and offset.  The ONLY hint I ever got about putting on oversize rims was a
Mercedes pattern.  I have no idea if this works, if the offset is correct, or
how much, but it might point you in the right direction.  I devoted an entire
week of my spare time to finding custom wheels for my Bus - the only ones it
seemed would fit were 14x6 Vanagon alloys!

Hope this helps, and keep me posted if you find anything!
