So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; i think it is a case of using the wrong material for the tank. my 88 bus
&gt; gets about 35,000-40,000 miles per tank. and i don't believe there is any
&gt; way to 'repair' the tank. :(  i suppose you could always replace the tank
&gt; with something of your own design and manufacturer, but for my cost of $40,
&gt; it's just not worth the trouble to me ... especially since the tanks seem
&gt; to last about 2 - 2.5 years.  and, yes, it seems to be a really common
&gt; problem: the dealer in atlanta keeps several of these in stock. (unlike the
&gt; ball joints, which they do NOT keep in stock).

You really change it that often?  I haven't really noticed a problem at 60K
miles.  Maybe I need to take a better look.  What are the tell-tale signs?
I don't have any leakage that I can see.
