&gt;&gt; My favorite was released by VW at the time of Jerry Garcia's passing - it
&gt;was
&gt;&gt; simply a yellow and white cartoon bus, head-and-side-on, shedding a single
&gt;&gt; tear.  VW obviously knows their customers... and showed a lot of heart.
&gt;
&gt;Just a reminder... You can get a copy of this ad from VoA by calling 
&gt;their 800 number and asking for it.  They will ask a couple of questions 
&gt;and send it out in about 1.5-2 weeks.  (I suppose that this is subject to 
&gt;availablity - I got mine about 2 months ago.)  The number is 
&gt;1-800-444-8987.  

Woahhh!  I just called this number - not only are they sending me the poster,
but also a video of the history of VW - all for free!!  Also referred me to
thier website at:
http://www.vw_dot_com                Yahoo!  (THANKS David!)
