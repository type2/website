&gt;one of the guys as a kind of pop top which is full size, looks like the Westy
&gt;top, but does not hinge. It rises straight up. The cool thing is that the top
&gt;was designed as a dealer conversion for the Transporter and does not need the
&gt;body modifications (reinforcements) that the archives mention. He says that
&gt;the only change is a hole nibbled in the roof.

the conversion done by Country Homes looked like that ... i don't know if they
nibbled a hole or just got the buses with sunroofs. you might check with them
and see if they put their names somewhere on the conversion (like a plaque
you could find).

Country Homes Campers             (408) 441-6280
493 Reynolds Circle               (408) 441-6282 FAX
San Jose, CA  95112               makes camper kits for vanagons/EV,
                                  which can be removed for weekday
                                  people hauling duties. pop-tops also.

&gt;and if youse all don't say that it sucks, I'll probably take a look at it
&gt;next week.

one nice feature listed in the Country Homes brochure was that the interior
was removable ... so you could take the camper stuff out and use the bus as
a regular people mover during the week.

unka whoozits :)
