&gt;       Speaking from experience, the 2800 V-6 is not much different in
&gt;power output than the 2600.  I have had both in my Capri and the 2800
&gt;feels faster, although only slightly.  I think the 2600 is rated 107hp
&gt;with 130 lb/ft of torque, while the 2800 is 105hp with 140lb/ft.  Not
&gt;too impressive, as you point out, but this was in 1973/74, and back
&gt;then, that was a lot of muscle for a 2300 pound car.  I have added a few
&gt;goodies to my 2.8, like headers, Offenhauser manifold, and a Holley 390
&gt;4-barrel carb, and it's a pretty quick car now, although as the original
&gt;poster said, it gets terrible mileage due to very short gearing.  Sorry
&gt;about the non-VW related content, but I just had to preserve the honor
&gt;of the 2.8 engine (or try, at least)  :)


No problemo, Dave-- I was also speaking from (necessarily limited)
experience. The two Mustangs I drove were dog-slow from a standing
start with 2800 V6s; whereas a '72 Capri with its 2600 could chirp its
tires on takeoff. Niether of these characteristics relate to peak HP
or torque-- more bottom end torque, and also trans gearing (all were
automatics-- I don't know what ratios). The difference (in this
statistically tiny sample) were very noticable. I just didn't LIKE
the feel of the 2800's I tried. If I ever put a Ford V6 in my bus,
it will be the 2600.
