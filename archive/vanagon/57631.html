Subject: power loss in '81

Further testing has revealed that my temp sensor tests 850 ohms, instead of
the 2500 Haynes says.

Also, pulling the plug wire for cylinder #3 off the distributor has no
effect on engine when it is running at about 2000 RPM in park.  Is this
likely the injector?

The refusing to start from a standing stop (bogs and engine almost dies,
until I can get it up to about 5 MPH) is temp related -- gets worse as
engine warms.

Overall power loss is not temp related.  Warm or cold, it goes about 40
max, and takes 3/4 of a mile to get there.

Thanks to all of the people who have been telling me what to check.  I have
learned my way around the engine a lot better today.

BTW, replaced all vacuum lines, but that didn't help.

Thanks again,

Bill
