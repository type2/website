Subject: 25th anniversary ed. of Muir

Just thought folks might want to know there's a new
25th anniversary edition of the Idiot Book out.  It's
in the old *spiral binding* no less.  Includes (I'm
quoting from publishers catalog) &quot;... a new retro-
spective introduction by Eve Muir, and never before
published photographs from the Muir family album of
John [and] Eve...&quot;

It's $25 and the ISBN is 1562611909 if your bookstore
needs to order.
