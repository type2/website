&gt;&gt; &gt;We put a piece of PVC pipe in my friend's '59. Works a treat - he never
&gt;&gt; &gt;realized he could have that much heat!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is PVC acceptible for this application in terms of vapors it may give off
&gt;&gt; when heated?  It's really convenient to use, but I'd like to be sure of 
the
&gt;&gt; safety factor first.  In any event it might be safer than the original
&gt;&gt; rusted out pipe with asbestos fibers leaking in from the 
gaskets/insulation.
&gt;
&gt;I haven't noticed any ill side effects, except that he suddenly thought
&gt;about voting republican...


Product of a clearer head. When the old, rusty heater tube went away,
the fumes from the stash inside went with it. Presto!   :^)
