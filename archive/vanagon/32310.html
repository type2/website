Hi all

&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't it be nice to log on to a web site, browse through
&gt; the diagrams and parts cross-references to find out what
&gt; part you actually need, and ORDER it from VW!  Instead we
&gt; are at the mercy of the parts man from ABC Motors who
&gt; doesn't know a Type II from a typewriter and is repeating
&gt; &quot;Vanawhat?&quot; while we describe the part we need.
&gt; 
&gt; VW made it in the U.S. because they had a parts and service
&gt; network along with the sales department.
&gt; 

Wow - it sure would be great - maybe a color-coded wiring diagram
for my '60 bug?

To be fair to VWoA, though - I needed some parts for my '60 Bug,
went to the parts guy at my local VW dealer, who was as much amused
as anything else - he pulled the 'fiche, found the part numbers, and
ordered the parts that were still available - they had to be shipped
in from another part of the country, but the parts network really is
there.  And the VW part numbers for the parts they didn't have were
handy for getting those same parts from other sources, like Wolfsburg
West, BFY Obsolete Parts, etc.
