Subject: Re: Bad Gas for Vanagons

Jack,

I use a 10% ethanol blend exclusively in my Vanagon - have since I 
brought it back from Germany in early 1993.  I've never had any problem 
with the engine, so assume there is no problem with the ethanol mix.  In 
fact, in my subjective experience, it is at least as peppy, if not more, 
than it was when I ran only straight gas.  Never any freeze-up problems, 
of course.
