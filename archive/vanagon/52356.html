Subject: Re: Syncro on the Dunes?

&gt;sand. Luckily friends towed us out, but I will no longer 
&gt;underestimate little patches of sand...
&gt;
&gt;And, no I don't think a syncro would have fared much better here 
&gt;either. (When we get one, I'll be sure to find out, though! ;)

over 20-30mph sand is as hard as concrete, it doesn't have a chance to move
out from under the tires.  The exception is very fine sand, more like dust
that grit.  Carrying 2 2x8 in 4 foot lengths works, and a jack plus large
jackfoot block, 2x8 x 12&quot;long.  You may only make it a few feet at a time,
until you can get your speed back up. Walking back 1/2 mile to retrieve
planks is not uncommon, once you hit firmer footing. Or you can copy Derek
Drew and tie the planks to the bumper with a good length of rope!  Loafs do
much better than vanagons off-road.  Vanagon plows the front too heavily.  Tim
