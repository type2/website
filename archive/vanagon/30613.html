Subject: need '76 or later bellhousing
Date: Tue, 12 Dec 1995 14:36:53 -0600 (CST)

I'm starting to give some thought to that little conversion project
planned to begin this Spring, once weather turns clement. 

KEP sells adapter kits/flywheels to match the Porsche 6 to a bus's
transaxle. Any bus, that is, except those with 215mm flywheels...

So I am in the market for a bellhousing from a '76 or later bus (not sure
*how* much later, though; '78? '79? '83? '91?). Potentially (read: if the
price is right), I might even be in the market for a 228mm (9&quot;) clutch and
flywheel (to allow easy reversion to stock).

So please let me know if you think you might have such parts available for
sale within, say, the next 3 months or so. 

Thanks!
