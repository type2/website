Howdy,
	
	Tonight I finished straightening and filling the right rear corner,
and I've started on the detail work, glazing the pinholes and scratches on 
the rest of the bus.

	I've found a coupla dents on the roof, but nothing that a couple of
whacks with a body hammer can't take care of...

	I'm having a friend of mine look for some hinge strips for the popouts-
if he finds them, I'll replace the existing hardware hinges with them.
I should prolly do a procedure write up sometime about how to put in
popout windows in split busses that didn't have them...
	
	I'm just about ready to take to bus apart for painting, just gotta
wait for the weather to stabilize...

Thom
