Subject: EV Mystery Powder (fun)

My two 84-lb dogs and I took a ride down Seattle's I-5 yesterday in my new
Eurovan. The boys (Nelson and Lumpy) are still getting accustomed to the
roominess, and they can't quite figure out where they like to ride. Accordingly,
they do a lot of bopping around and can get into mischief.

So I'm driving along, minding my own business, when a sudden blast of  white
powder covers the passenger-side door. I'm completely bufuddled, until I realize
that Nelson, in his exuberance, has inadvertently landed paws-first on the fire
extinguisher (located at floor level, just in front of the sliding side door).

I think I might have to do some reshuffling of the standard layout....&lt;g&gt;
