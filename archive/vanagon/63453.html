Subject: Problems problems

Since the list went down I've
1. Had a broken release bearing shaft
2. Replaced the calipers and had them heat up to sizzling.
3. Replace the Master cylinder and the booster and the whole mess under the
   dash.
4. Had a stripped bleeder hole on a rebuilt caliper.
5. Now I have an intermittent cutting out during in-town driving.
I've read the archives on intermittent missing, and wonder if there is
anything anyone can add. This isn't the kind of cutting out that makes me stop
by the side of the road.  It only lasts a second or so and then starts up.  I
really wanted to take a trip to Pennsylvania next week, but we've cancelled it
becuausse of all these troubles making us not trust the van.

Any advice is welcome.
