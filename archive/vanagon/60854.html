Subject: Archives off

Due to a disk crash (and the low priority of this function) the vanagon list
archives are currently offline.
(this would be http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/vanagon.html)

When the new disk comes in, I'll put 'em back up.
I'll try to get some kind of message out there on the server...
