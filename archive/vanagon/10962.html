Subject: Re:  Bolt-on Empi Valve cover question

Lee,

I have heard nothing but bad things about these bolt on covers, seems that 
the differential thermal expansion will almost gaurentee that they will
leak. when VW made the spring bails which hold onthe steel covers they did
it to compensate for the effect. I have always found that with clean heads
and a clean cover that the seal is sufficient. Every once in a while a leak
will develop and it takes two seconds to throw on a new gasket.
