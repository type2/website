&gt;  The engine is a 2.1 on my '86 Syncro Westy.  Any input is

Craig,

You may get lucky with VWoA, but with an '86 with (how many miles?), they may
tell you that the vehicle has already reached its intended service life.  I
know this is a lame answer, but actually, depending on your mileage, you're
pretty lucky to have made it this far.  My '88 Vanagon GL (2.1L) had to have
it's gaskets replaced at about 70K miles.  I believe it cost me around
US$1000, but since the van at the time was only 3 years old, VWoA picked up
66 percent of the cost.  That was four years ago, and the heads have not
leaked since.  However, I keep the coolant fresh by changing twice per year,
because the corrosion inhibitors wear out over time, which adds to the
likelihood of head and/or gasket leaks.

As far as the repair shop telling you to let the gaskets go until they blow,
the risk you run is that you heads themselves will become so pitted over time
that they, too, will need replacement, which will add BIG BUCKS to the repair
bill.  Also, you won't be able to predict where you are when they blow, and
you could dump all of your coolant in a big hurry, which would leave you with
a BIG tow bill (if you don't burn up your engine before you can pull over).
 I think you'd be better off getting the head gaskets replaced as soon as
possible, then keep your coolant changed at regular intervals, and save up
for your next head gasket replacement in another 70-120K miles.

Good Luck!
