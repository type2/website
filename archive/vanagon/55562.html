Subject: I think the Volkswagen Gods like me???

Thanx to all list members for your help with my vanagon! I spent the better
half of the day cleaning ground wires, changing spark plugs, spraying just
about everything with WD40 &quot;thanx Lawrence&quot; and changing a few hoses. The
weather here in Northern Ontario was great - 8, so I was able to do most of
the work in the parking lot of my building. My problems seem to be be
fixed.:)

Thanx to all the great folks on this list. Without u guys I would be lost.
Hope I can meet some of u at Buses by the Arch/ Buses by the Tunel.
