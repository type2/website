Subject: '62 Brake job: Final installment

Hi,
Thought I'd let you all know I finally got the brakes finished on my 1962
Dormobile.

I had proudly assembled everything last Friday afternoon, went for a test-drive
around the block, came back to find brake fluid spewing out of the front hubs.
:-(  All over my lovely clean new shoes. :-(
I hadn't done the copper brake lines up tight enough. Duh. 

My boyfriend had to help me at this point or I'd never have got it done in time
for our few days holiday in the New Forest which we were due to depart for
the following day.
Anyway, a nightmare few hours ensued with hubs going on and off at a rate of
knots (by torchlight as it was 8pm by the time we finished)

It's all been worth it, it's wonderful to be able to STOP at last! And great
fun to be
back on the road with lots of enthusiastic bay-window drivers waving like crazy
all the way to Lymington. 

Thanks to all who helped,

Sarah

P.S. Going to a &quot;Gong&quot; gig today in the split. Any fans out there? They
recently toured
the States.
