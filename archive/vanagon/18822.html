To All:

&quot;Free!  One Year Subscription!&quot;

(I swear to God, that's exactly what it sez.)

Call (312) 431-6102.  Tell the young lady your friend gave you this funny
post card.  The code in the corner reads: A420.

The humor about the 'Free Subscription' is subtle.  Once you're on the JCW
mailing list you will receive about 20 pounds of catalogs a year.  This will
continue up to three years from the date of your last order.  To give your
some idea of their tenacity, I got on the list by writing them a formal
complaint; they were still sending catalogs to my father-in-law a year after
his death.  They never acknowledged my letter but the catalogs stopped
coming...  and then reappeared, addressed to ME!  (Ya gotta give 'em credit
for trying.)

-Bob
