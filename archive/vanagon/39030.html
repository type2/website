Subject: &quot;Bile&quot; rack for a Eurovan - reply



I have a Rhoad (sp?) Gear bike rack attached to the rear door of my 84 Westy.
The straps are adjusted so that the top bar rests above the window not on it.
The windscreen wiper still works and I can lift the hatch WITH the bikes on
the rack as long as I have a strong helper to keep it up while I reach inside.
I keep the rack permanently installed and have carried bikes long distances
over rough roads with no trouble (eg. all the way from Portland to Alaska and
back with two bikes)
