Subject: NEW Eurovan MV/Weekender clarification


Howdy, and thanks to the many of you who replied with many words of
encouragement about Weekenders and MV's. However, I was aware of those models
made by Westfalia in '93. As my folks are looking only for a new model, I was
wondering more if Winnebago now did any sort of convresion like that. My folks
are looking to get a brand new Van, so it would have to be a '96 or '97 model.
Any word on those???
Thanks,
