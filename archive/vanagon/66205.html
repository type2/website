&gt;With the onset of colder weather here in WY, my van has taken on a new
&gt;ailment.  When I first start the engine and the engine is cold, it will
&gt;idle at about 400 RPMs and a high pitch screech will sound from the
&gt;engine compartment.  If I rev the engine, it stops, and it stops if I
&gt;run the engine for 30-40 seconds.  The noise has been getting
&gt;progressively louder as the temperature gets colder.  I haven't been
&gt;able to get to the engine, before the screeching stops, so I can't
&gt;identify where it is coming from.  Is the low idle related to the
&gt;screech or is the screech related to the low idle?
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas what this problem could be?

Stephen,
     I had a similar problem with the screeching when cold.  I found it to
be a loose altenater belt.  Seem when cold the belt would slip more, either
because of the rubber being stiff or the added altenater output to charge
the battery after cranking a cold engine.  I used a belt dressing and
tightened the belt.  Becareful not to tighten the belt too much, a failed
water pump will result, if the belt is too tight.
    Hope this helps.
