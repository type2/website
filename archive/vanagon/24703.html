Subject: Re: buses in movies

&gt; The Thread That Never Dies ... :)

...we had &quot;ancient video nite&quot; yesterday, and we were watching THE CHINA
SYNDROM&quot;, and there's a beautiful red/white baywindow bus parked right in
front of the nuclear power plant as jack lemmon pulls in, haulin' ass...
forthe rest of the movie we were mainly discussing who was the EMLOB
(&quot;employee most likely to own the bus&quot;) and the role of buses in
thermonuclear reactions (...firestarter ???)...

&gt; was watching a bit of &quot;The Scout&quot; on cable tonight, and this baseball scout
&gt; is down somewhere in mexico/central america, riding on a big school bus with
&gt; about 900 other people/goats/chickens, etc. anyway, it's a narrow two-lane
&gt; road (see Copleys' Trip Reports for further descriptions), and this red
&gt; Mexican VW Bus, complete with water cooled engine (cause it had this great
&gt; big radiator grill up front!), decides to pass the school bus ... but there
&gt; is this big truck coming in the other direction.
&gt;
&gt; ever seen three lanes of traffic on a two-lane road??? :)  the vw bus got
&gt; away safely.
