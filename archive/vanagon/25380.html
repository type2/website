Just for the record, when I was ordering some stuff from them this
week, I was informed that they no longer have a Tech Support or
Customer Support department.  The guy in sales that I talked to still
did his best to help me (just as anyone there I've ever talked to
has), but it struck me a little odd that they'd shut down those
departments.

FWIW, I got my parts two days later, just as expected.
