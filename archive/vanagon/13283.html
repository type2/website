Hi Alistair.  I won't necessarily poo-poo ;)  Actually, they DO ride a tad
harder than the XCH4 Michelins, but they are also a lot stiffer, heavier tire.
Tires are a compromise, and for the Syncro Westy (weighed ours in at 
over 5200 lbs loaded) there's a lot of weight to push you around.  A 
good, strong tire is required for decent handling.  Also, with such 
high pressures for the Syncro (43 f / 53 r) about 10 psi more than 
the 2wd Vanagons, the ride was even harsh on the Conti Transporter 
tires the van was shipped with.  For off-road excursions, a strong 
sidewall is a must as well.  

The Yokos are also nicely made.  I have one tire (a front one) that 
has no weights on it, and is perfectly balanced,  the other 3 tires 
have less than 1/2 ounce on them.  Pretty decent quality control for 
such a heavy duty type tire.  I am on my second set ( I still have a 
50% worn set in my basement for later use), and both sets have been 
identical.

Catch you later,
Harry.
