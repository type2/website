&gt; Why VW chose to have the bugs make the chirping sound I
&gt;don't know, but I like it -- gives the cars some personality.


Breaks up the low-frequency sounds (&quot;exhaust rumble&quot;) and turns them
into high-frequency sounds (&quot;chirp!&quot;), which are then better filtered out
by the car's insulation. Chirping cars are quieter inside!

Could this be the reason?
