Subject: 36hp troubles/A LOT of old splits

I finally dropped the motor out of my bus this week.
The pistons are welded to the jugs, warped heads. :(
(I guess it got a little hot at one point.:^))

On a brighter note...

There's a place in Olympia,WA that has in their yard:

numerous microbusses in various states of repair;

at least 2 deluxes (64/65, I think)

a 63? westy.

a 64 23-window.

and (I had to go and touch this one.) a 1953 barn door!

I'm going to see if I can put their phone# on the list,

as I forgot to ask them.

Anyhow, I got the original manuals for my 63 yesterday, in a trade.

and I was wondering if anyone knew a source for 36hp parts. (Not

for the above engine...I have a spare.)
