Subject: Re: Need Information about Eurovan(s)

&gt;Vanagon is now built and sold in South Africa with the 5 cyl Audi engine. 
&gt;It's my guess that a bolt-in swap could be done if one could obtain the
&gt;right South African parts. (?)

OK, now I'm really interested, who's got the S.A Bentley manual for these 
vehicles. What part #s, which engine etc. Would our S.A correspondent please 
report in?

thanks, tim s.
