Subject: Northwest gathering??? (WA,OR,ID,BC...???)

In a typical show of Pacific Northwest reservedness, the response was,
shall we say, less than overwhelming to the concept of a NW gathering.
2 list members have responded, bringing the total to 3. Now, the date
and location hasn't been considered yet, so hopefully it'll be around
March or so, when there's a chance at some dry weather.
