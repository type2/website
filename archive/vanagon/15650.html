Subject: Carb Specs??????

  This may sound like a total idiot-stick question, but how does one
 adjust the mixture on the dual carbs found on 1700 powerplants? There
 is, of course the &quot;volume control screw&quot;, but no matter how much I
 adjust this, my baby still spews black smoke (and gets worse mileage
 than a Harley). Is there a way to lean the mixture out on these carbs? 
  Or will the rest of my truckin' life be filled with raunch odours and
 empty pocketbooks?
