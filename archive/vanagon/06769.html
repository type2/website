Subject:       a great winter tire...

I've had a set of 4 Summit (TM) Trail Climbers on our van for going 
on our second winter season now.  DEEP aggressive tread, load range 
C, high pressure tolerant (65psi I think), stable in cross-winds.  
These have a bit of road noise per the snow tread but we need the 
traction (year round) more than the aesthetic quality.  They're great 
for poking around logging roads (jeez, you should see the side of our 
van- scratches to beat heck, but at least we 'use' the van), getting 
into cross-country ski areas etc.  

These would probably be a bit radical for you warm climate-ers but I 
swear by (not at) them.

Joel- FYI  most people in northern Minnesota consider 
themselves more a part of the Canadian provinces than of the 
'States'--   uh, let's see...  Minnetoba?  Ontarisota?
