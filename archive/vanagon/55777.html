&gt;  
&gt;  We have an 88 we have owned for 2 years that we need to sell.  Can't
really
&gt;  afford the insurance for a vehicle we haven't been able to use to its
&gt;  potential in the past 6 months. It has 99k and is in good shape.  It is
&gt;  maroon with a grey interior.  Everything works and it drives well.  It is
a 
&gt; 4
&gt;  speed.  We would like to get $8500 for it.
&gt;  thanks, Brian and Nicole
