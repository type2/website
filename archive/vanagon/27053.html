The July issue of the NEATO newsletter described installing an old
windshield washer with its nozzle pointing into the carb. With the
washer filled with diesel fuel, a good squirt will send a huge
cloud of greasy black smoke into the tailgator's face.  

I kind of like the electromagnetic pulse idea too.  Maybe a
small nuclear charge?
