You could do it, but I don't think you would be able to use the fridge 
while charging.  What you would have to do is charge 6V batteries in 
parallel, and discharge them in series.  It would require a few high amp 
relays for changin the battery layout.

You seem to want to keep it 6V, but I think the easiest way is to go 12V.
