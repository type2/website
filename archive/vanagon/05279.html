&gt; You ain't seen nothing yet! Apparently temps get down to -30C around here
&gt; (that's the point when most Ottawans stop skating to work...).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It may mean that over the short term, that I learn to park on hills. This
&gt; trick always worked for the KG when it wouldn't start....but I have heard
&gt; that push starting/roll starting a car with a cat can damage the cat
&gt; (something about raw fuel....) -- 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks anyway for all the helpful ideas...DC

Oh no David, you're not going to push-start a Vespa when it's -30! I tried
that with a Peugeot 504 from the top of the hill in Quebec City (near the
Frontenac). That's a good sized hill, that would like adequate in San Francisco.Each time I popped the clutch the car came to an immediate stop as if the
clutch were the brake pedal. Finally had it towed to a garage to warm up,
then went to the nearest dealer for a block heater. The next morning it
started immediately (though it was about -35C).
