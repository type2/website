&gt; Dear Pete Sellers and anyone who wants a .pcx file,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, I have a mac, so I don't &quot;do&quot; pcx or jpeg.  Unfortunately,
&gt; I don't have a picture of me in digital format, but I CAN
&gt; give you this ascii one. 

Three cheers for Martha!!!!  She uses a REAL computer, as I do.  :P
Hey, I have some great jpeg viewers for the Mac, let me know and I'll
dcc them to ya on IRC.  Speaking of IRC, are Martha and I the only two
on this list that know what it is?  Hmmm... maybe we should start a #VW
channel...
