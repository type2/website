Subject: beheaded CV bolts: Left handed drills found!

	Well, I tried Imparts and they didn't have left handed drills,
but Griot's (1-800-345-5789) do have left-twist drills in their bolt-remover
kit, which sells for $34. I suspect this is the same kit the original
poster with the broken CV bolt was looking at. So much for my cheap
comment about not knowing what a &quot;bolt extractor kit&quot; was- I'm buying
one! Will report when it arrives.

	I've only ever had one failure using easy-outs- it was the
alternator bracket bolt for my Rabbit, which sheared. I drilled it out
big but the easy-out couldn't get the steel bolt out of the aluminum
head. After an afternoon's work, I had drilled the 8mm bolt out to over
 1/8&quot;  and still couldn't get it out, so I drilled and tapped it for
sae 1/4&quot;/20tpi bolt and used 1/4-20 bolts in place of the stock 8mm. 
Whenever that head gets to the rebuilders, they're gonna wonder!

	Bill
