Subject: EV GL (auto) still 4 sale...

I know I posted this before I left for France (back in December), and I took 
some flak from Moe about my comments about automatics (Moe and his EV are 
shiftless!)...but we need to find this EV a home! So how 'bout it folks! 
Here's the details:

93 EuroVan GL - automatic, power windows and locks, deluxe radio package, 
A/C, 31k miles, etc. $15,995 ( I know they will deal on this one...) 
Pearson-Miller, North Dartmouth, MA  (508) 999-4573.
