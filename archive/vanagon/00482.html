Subject:      range on a tank of gas

i normally fill up at 250-260 miles by the trip odometer. i don't trust the
gauge (because of the upside-down saddle shape of the tank, i think it's
screwy anyway: when my needle is close to E, downhill makes the needle go
up, and uphill makes the needle drop).  that's basically why i put that
trip computer in ... to KNOW how much gas i had used up.

the most i've ever gotten out of a tank was 321 miles ... put 15.9 gallons
into the tank. :) but i have gone to and slightly over 300 miles several
times.

now, having said that ... if you fill up until you see gasoline in the
filler neck, you've actually put in more than 16 gallons. on my 1986 bus,
i went to colorado and going across kansas, i went for 340 miles before i
prudently decided it was really really really time to stop for gas (actually,
it was the FIRST gas station i saw since kansas city). anyway, i put 16.4
gallons into the tank.  yes, the car was still running when i pulled up to
the tank. no, it wasn't sputtering. :)
