Hello Everyone,

For what it's worth, I entered my name and address on the German VW web 
page (accessed from Peter's page) and the Caravelle/Multivan, California 
Coach brochures and the tech brochures for the above as well as the tech 
brochure for the Transporter truck variations showed up in the mail today.

The cover letter says, &quot;Our partners for Volkswagen are responsible for all 
sales and service matters. If you have any other questions please contact 
them in your vicinity. He will inform you and take care of your orders and 
wishes.&quot; I can just imagine if I took one of these brochures to my local 
dealer here in Washington state and asked them to quote on a Syncro 
Caravelle in Frisian green or Hot chilli red pearl with double glazed 
windows in the passenger compartment, an external spare tire (as on sport 
utilities), etc., etc.

Oddly enough, according to the brochure, the syncro is not available with 
the VR6 or TDI, just the 2.5l 5 cylinder or the 2.4l diesel. : (
