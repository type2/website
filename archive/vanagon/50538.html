 I have just installed new Dansk pipes on my 84.  The two pipes I replaced
are
 the pipe from the rear (cyl 2&amp;4) of the engine, and the pipe from the 
 catalytic converter to the engine. There is a leak at the junction between
 the pipe to the Cat and the two pipes to the engine (its a three way 
 connection) due to bad pipe geometry (dont buy Dansk pipes).  Does anyone
 have any quick fix ideas?  I have tried high temp silicone (copper color)
 but it lasted
 about 50 miles.  I am thinking of doubling the gaskets up and trying
again...

Are you using the correct gaskets?  Beetle gaskets will fit but due to the
smaller inside diameter, they will burn out quickly.  As inferior as the
Dansk pipes are, they usually do not have prblems if all rpalced together.
 They just do not last as long as OEM.  Also,  are all the brackets in place.
 Any missing bracket will palce strain on the connections and cause them to
leak and break.
