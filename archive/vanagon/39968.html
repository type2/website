Subject: RE: Bus wanted / Ghia for sale (San Diego)


&gt;HI folks.  I'm looking for a '71 camper in good condition in San Diego, and
&gt;would appreciate any leads on this.  I'm not completely familiar with these
&gt;vans, so I'd also appreciate some local help - would any of the San Diegan
&gt;list members volunteer to help me inspect one or two cars?


I'll have a look-see if you like. Let me know if you find one you're
interested.

I'm not a master mechanic by any means. But I've had several buses,
seen some rust, smoke, jammed trannies, etc., and can spot reasons
to buy or not to buy (forsooth) a type-2.
