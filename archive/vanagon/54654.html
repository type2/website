Subject: RE: Really COLD starts 

When I lived in Minnesota I had a hard time figuring out what weight oil to use.

Given the range of temperatures I was seeing during January-March, 5W30 was too light during 
the warmer days (&gt;32F) and 10W30 was too heavy during the colder days (-35F).

I started using synthetic oil 10 years ago and have not turned back.

I now use 5W50 year round and have never had a starting problem in the winter.

I had the oil in my Mazda tested last year by Smart Check (800-826-6071) at 120,000 mi. and 
it showed no engine wear problems at all.

&gt;Hi all.
&gt;
&gt;I'm waiting for the weather to warm up so I can do some work on my van
&gt;(install used engine).  It's been too cold to start working outside ( -41
&gt;before wind chill (yes minus 41 degrees)).  I live in Northern Ontario
&gt;Canada.  40 below is 40 below celcius, farenheit, same thing.  It was only
&gt;a couple of days, but we usually get about a week of that stuff near the
&gt;end of January.
&gt;
&gt;The first year I had my van (85 transporter), I was coming home from work
&gt;at about 5 am, 40 below and my oil light came on.  I pulled over to find my
&gt;oil all up my back door and in a puddle underneath.  Scared the heck out of
&gt;me but it ended up it was only the oil filter gasket had blown out.  Quick
&gt;change that afternoon and all was well.  I still had to walk home though (3
&gt;miles).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Anyone know what weight of oil is recommended when hell freezes over?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;There was some talk of block heaters on the list a while back.  I couldn't
&gt;live without one.  My 74 transporter had one as well.  Every bug I ever
&gt;bought had one too.  They are actually &quot;oil heaters&quot; on the air cooled
&gt;ones, and the water cooled one is the same only bigger.  It basically is an
&gt;element in an aluminum block that bolts to the bottom of your motor and
&gt;keeps things toasty.
&gt;
&gt;When I first got my water cooled it didn't have one (I bought the van in
&gt;Southern Ontario).  A cold snap set in and I was stranded.  To get to the
&gt;dealer to buy a block heater (an hour away) I had to use an old trick my
&gt;grandfather used to use when he worked in the bush.  When the skidders and
&gt;dozers wouldn't start, they would light a fire underneath.  Not so
&gt;dramatic, I filled an enamel pan with hot coals from the wood stove and
&gt;propped it up on boards until it was close enough to just warm my bottom
&gt;(my engine bottom ;~)  ).  After three hours and a bunch of refills, old
&gt;unfaithful sputtered to life.
&gt;
&gt;I thought that this is maybe what caused my filter gasket to go, but almost
&gt;on the exact same day, one year later, and almost in the exact spot. . .
&gt;(play twilight zone music now)  it happened again.  It was later in the day
&gt;and I got a ride that time.  I was even using lighter oil.  How light can I
&gt;go at 40 below?
&gt;
&gt;The next year the van was parked for January, and this year I'm replacing
&gt;the engine, so I don't have to worry, but we still have a couple of months
&gt;of winter left.  If anyone has cold weather experience with their vans or
&gt;any recommendations, let haul, I'ld like to hear from you.
&gt;
&gt;And does Propex make an industrial size heater? Ha, kidding. My BA6 will
&gt;melt plastic (left a cassette by the floor vent).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

&gt;still looking at an 86 syncro
&gt;
&gt;Does really cold weather affect VC operation in a Syncro?
&gt;Any other list members live in the North?
