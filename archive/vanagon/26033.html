Hi all.  I am looking to put seats with headrests into my '71 bus.  I 
have it from one source that those from a '73 or '74 will slide right 
onto my rails.  I need to nail down the year(s) that will slide right 
onto my '71 rails and which of those years had headrests.  I hope that
makes sense, I haven't finished my coffee.  Jim
