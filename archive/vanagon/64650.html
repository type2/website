Ron,

Hello from Paul (86 Syncro) former member of the list serve.  I'm in
Alaska with a friend who is a fellow Vanagonaut.  She is attempting to
leave and head toward the 48 but has enountered problems recently.  Her
name is Heide and here she is . . .

Hello Ron, Paul has informed me about this internet access before, but
as of yet I haven't needed it.  My mechanic is stumped this time,
however, and we are both bummed out.  I have an 87 vanagon, automatic
transmission.  The problem is that it's running on only 3 cylinders.
The fuel injector was changed, there is plenty of compression, there is
fire at the plug, and there is fuel at the plug.  All these things
should make it run like the champ that it is, but it is not.  Mike, my
mechanic (and vanagon owner) feels like a failure, and I'm feeling a
little trapped.  If you have any suggestions of what we should try,
Please, please, please let me know. Unfortunately, I have very limited
access to a computer, this is it in fact.  If you perhaps could do me
the favor and post this on the list serve for me, and if you could fax
me the responses in care of Paul Holmdahl at 907-683-2502, I would be
more then appreciative.  If it is easier to contact by phone, you can
reach Paul at 800-230-7275, or me at 907-683-2597 if you leave a
message, I'll phone back.  Do I sound desperate?? I kind of am.  My
present location is kind of in the middle of nowhere, and I would be so
greatful if you could help me get out.  Thanks.
                                                                                        Heide
