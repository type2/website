Subject: Limbo party this weekend.

Hi Volks,
   I know its short notice, but this Sunday, LiMBO will be having a
newsletter folding and stamping party.  Free food and maybe beer.  Get your
newsletter early.  It will be held in Barnstable, MA.  If anyone is
interested please let me know.  Its a good time, even though you have to do
some work.  Take care.
