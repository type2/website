Subject: Tom via Rachel; new WWW page location

Sorry to post this to the list, gang, but I keep getting bounced:

Tom via Rachel Martin: I've been trying to get ahold of you to say yes, 
I'd like the Westy tent page to go in NEATO news.  rmart_at_umn_dot_edu has been 
described to me as an unknown address by your server.

BTW, those into laborious downloads of huge, dithered .gifs should know 
that the Westy Tent WWW page is now at www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/tents.html,
and my mini-VW page is now at www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/vwstuff.html.

And I finally revised my .sig;

Not your typical old Joe Clark------------------jclark_at_nexus.polaris_dot_net
|   Tallahassee, Florida        Where do you go when you're Toad Away? |
|     Florida info, original fiction, VW stuff, IVD &amp; kids' links:     |
&lt;a href=&quot;http//www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/&quot;&gt;Homepage.&lt;/a&gt;_________________|

(The compensation for paying for your own account is the fact that no 
disclaimers are required.  I get to be a complete egotist.)

Happy vannin'
BTW my fave is &quot;Too much, Magic Bus&quot;
