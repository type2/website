&gt;&gt;&gt;Does anyone know what the differences are between the various colours of
&gt;&gt;&gt;torsion bars as regards the different models of bay window VWs?
&gt;
&gt;On Bay Window 68-79 Models, Red or Brown Bars are Standard Load Duty.  Heavy
&gt;Duty Bars, normally installed on Ambulances and most Commercial Models are
&gt;Green as per Factory Microfiche.  Green bars are very difficult to locate :(
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;My .005 cents worth :)
&gt;
FYI, my '71 has orange or maybe brown ones.  It's a factory Westfalia so it's
got SOME extra weight to it, but apparently not enough to warrent bars like
for an ambulance.  But I'd never heard of this color coding myself.  I DO know
that according to Bentley, different years/models had different DIAMETER bars,
with different numbers of splines.  I don't have my book right here, but I
remember it had a pretty good table with the different diameters and spring
plate angles for different vehicles.
