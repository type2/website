]I have to jump in here regarding all of the Negative, and sometimes
]unfounded comments regarding the EuroVan. First off, the EuroVan is
]not a Vanagon, or a Bay Window van, or a splitwindshield van for
]that matter. Nor is it a friggen Dodge Caravan.
]
]All of the points that I have heard so far is that this is nothing
]more than a minivan, and an underpowered one at that. Get a clue
]folks.
]
]VW definately has some marketing problems in the US, thats a given,
]however, it does not have problems in other markets. The T4 van
]which is the EuroVan designation, is already out selling T3s or
]Vanagons, back in the home markets (if you compare units per
]year). So obviously VW is doing something right.

I'm sure I'm one of the ones your flamethrower is aimed at.  Yes, I
have been comparing the EuroVan to Caravans and their ilk.  My point
was NOT that the EuroVan doesn't have a special place in the market
by function, but that the American PERCEPTION of the EuroVan as just
another Caravan clone without the style was a real sales hurdle.  I
stand by that.  No matter how good your product is, if the public
perceives it poorly you're in trouble, and in this market VW is.

]Sorry Joel...I just had to vent...and uphold the honor of the EuroVan. ;-)

I don't think the EuroVan's honor should be a stake here, but the that of
the marketing department of VWoA possibly ought to be.
