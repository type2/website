&gt;&gt; &gt;Right to the problem: Every time I exit the freeway, the oil pressure 
&gt;&gt; &gt;light and buzzer (you know, the one that triples your heart rate in a 
&gt;&gt; &gt;split second) come on. In every instance, I have immediately pulled over,

&gt;&gt; &gt;stopped the engine, and checked the oil (always fine). I turn the engine 
&gt;&gt; &gt;on again after a minute or two and everything is fine (no light, no 
&gt;&gt; &gt;buzzer). Is this my vans way of telling me it doesn't want to leave the 
&gt;&gt; &gt;freeway? 8-) Any advise of information is appreciated.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sounds like you may have a viscosity and or wear issue.  What oil are you
&gt;&gt; using and how hot is your engine getting?  The whole idea of that
&quot;Dynamic&quot;
&gt;&gt; system is to give you some warning before it's too late.  Check actuall
oil
&gt;&gt; pressure with a aguge and the engine &quot;HOT&quot;  A healthy engine with 20-50
&gt;will
&gt;&gt; hold 10 to 15 psi at idle and 35-50 psi at 3000 rpm.

&gt;Thanks Dennis, I think you're right, it is a viscosity issue. I'm not 
&gt;sure of the viscosity of the previous oil as I just acquired the van, 
&gt;however, I just changed the oil (20-50) and the problem hasn't occurred 
&gt;since. The temp gauge is fairly constant at the midpoint so it seems to 
&gt;be staying cool enough.

&gt;

During extended high speed driving, the oil will become much hotter than the
water temp.  260 or more is not unusual.  Especially if you drive at 70mph+.
 I know many people disagree with my thoughts on using high viscosity oil,
but the VW oiling system needs it.  Check your owners manual.  This is one
benfit of the synthetic oils as they naturally high viscosity index without
the nead for VI improvers.  The Mobil 1 15-50 is excelent for the Vanagon as
it replaces a conventional 20-50 but still flows readliy well below 0.  I use
it all year round.

Dennis.
