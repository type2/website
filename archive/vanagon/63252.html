Subject:      More on Octane rating for Wasserboxer

Fellow Listees!

In my book -- &quot;VW BUS und Transporter/ -Syncro 60/78/90/95/112 PS
(Wasserboxer) Oktober '82 bis August '90&quot; By H.R.Etzold , Delius Klasing
Verlag -- there are two different timing advance settings depending on
which fuel you use. That is for the 1.9 liter 90 hp  (8.6:1 comp) GW and
the higher compression (10.5:1) 2.1 liter 112 hp DJ engines.
The fuel specified for these engines is unleaded 98 (RON) octane, and you
are supposed to use a timing advance angle of 10 +/- 1 degree. BUT, there
is a note saying that for unleaded 95 (RON) you should use 5 to 1 degrees
timing advance.

BTW, here in Sweden gasoline is sold in three grades: 95, 96 and 98 octane
(RON), with variations as to containing lead replacement or not.

Even more BTW, this winter I participated in a conference on &quot;Can children
become hyperactive and criminal from environmental toxines and certain
foodstuffs?&quot; (The title was clumsily worded in swedish too)

One lecturer, and the most popular one, was Dr Alexander Schauss D Ph.
Criminologist, psycologist from the US.

His conclusions after doing research on thousands of violent criminals are
that they all have high levels of lead, copper, cadmium and manganese in
their systems. He was very concerned about the manganese, as it is used to
replace lead in gasoline.
