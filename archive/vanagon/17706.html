$$First, the turn signals don't work.  Further, when I pull the emergency
$$flasher, I burn fuse 6 (or 7?)  Does it make sence that the problem is
$$just the emergency flasher switch?

$$Thanks in advance!

I had a bum turn signal switch, which on my 1970 affected turn signals, 
emergency flashers, and brake lights(!).  Ya might just check it, too.
