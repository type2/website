Subject:      Re: Door vents

What really bugs me about these silly door vents... is why VW went to
the expense of putting them in?  What purpose do they serve?  In summer
with the AC I keep them closed.  In the winter the heat blow just fine
into the cavernous Vanagon.  It's not like it is air tight with nowhere
to go...
Just another example of engineers on drugs?
