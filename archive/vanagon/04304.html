&gt;I think for much of our generation VWs were our first car.  Then we found 
&gt;out that we could maintain them ourselves or could find someone who knew
&gt;how and learned from them.  I've seen alot of VWs out there where the father
&gt;would take car of it and the son or daughter would just drive it till they
&gt;wrecked it.  I think if the first car you owned was not a VW, then it is
&gt;not likely that you'll ever own one.  And if that same person bought one
&gt;they would soon get rid of it.  It's just a first-love afair that never 
&gt;dies.

That sounds just like my family.  We have owned many VWs over the years with
a 72 bus being the longest.  After learning how to drive in '80 (in a 76 Pacer)
I drove the bus during high school and college.  We had to get rid of it in '87
when moving but by then we already had the Vanagon.  I drive that for several
years before moving to Rabbits but my 17 year-old brother drives the Vanagon
now.  He did it in high school and will do so for college.  He likes it because
he can carry all his band equipment in it.
