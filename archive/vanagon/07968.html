well ... depends on the ones you have. i finally got tired of those k-mart
types, and went down to the 'real' auto store, and bought a pair of 'real'
jack stands: 2-ton, ratchet-thingie, with a square (four-sided base). they
cost about $50 (nowadays, i think), but they are long-term, heavy-duty,
solid-built, hard-to-carry, etc. all-that-good-quality-junk. in other words,
it's a buy-for-life kinda deal. they can lift the bus up about 18&quot;, but i
have to do that outside (the quote-garage-unquote isn't tall enough for the
bus and the jackstands).

then a few years ago, i decided that i needed to be able to work on all four
wheels at once, so i bought another set. :)

gee, i almost look like a real mechanic!
