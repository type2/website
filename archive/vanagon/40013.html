Sorry, sorry, sorry, 

but you guys are all so into vehicles someone has to know something about 
an old 1966 GMC Panel Truck right?  Something stupid like what the 
blinking light on the dash is?  Hey, the &quot;little woman&quot; (she's really 
short) is having problems, and I just don't know.  so, sorry.
