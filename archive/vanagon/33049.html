     Well as it happens I have been working on my vanagon for the last few 
     months.  Here are some of the places I've run across - all numbers are 
     area coded 303.  Personally I like Wright's German Motors and Jay's 
     Bugg house best, and of course there are a number of Volswagon dealers 
     in the area too.

Can anyone email me directly some names of good VW shops here in the 
Denver area.  The trip out here last year took its toll on my '85.  
Looks like its time for some major orthopedic surgury on my heads.  
     
Thanks
