Subject: Blaupunkt Manual

My '86 Vanagon came with a Blaupunkt AM/FM Casette radio. The faceplate says
&quot;Aspen SQR 24&quot;. Although the van came with the original owner's manual, there
was nothing to cover the operation of the radio. Was there a separate manual
for the radio and, if so, are there copies of that manual available anywhere?
I've already E-Mailed Blaupunkt USA but they couldn't help.  
Thanks-
Chuck Anderson
