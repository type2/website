Subject: Re: Kelly Park Show - April 9th

&gt;&gt;On April 9th at Kelly Park just outside of downtown San Jose there is a VW
&gt;show, 
&gt;&gt;probably one of the first in No-Cal for the season.  (Last weekend there
was a 
&gt;&gt;SOTO meet in Long Beach, but I heard it was pretty small.)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If anyone needs more details, let me know.  I've got the flyer at home and
can 
&gt;&gt;relay all of the info.
&gt;
&gt;I'd love more details on this.  Do people sell Vans there?  Or just parts?

Ron,
This is an exceptional vintage show.  There will be many early bug, ghias,
buses etc.  A very good swap meet as well.  There may be some later stuff
for sale (post 1967) but it'll mainly be vintage.  There will be all kinds
of things for sale, from memorbilia, vehicles, and parts.

The show typically opens at 9am. but if you want to hit the swap early, I
advise you to get there at 8am. or earlier.  San Jose Historical Museum is
located on Senter Road off Tully right next to Happy Hollow Park. 

Take 101 south 
Right on Tully
Right on Senter Rd.
Kelly Park is on Right about 2 blocks up.

See you there.

Brendan
