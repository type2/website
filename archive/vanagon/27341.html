&gt;Emissions testing here in Seattle involves putting the vehicle on a 
&gt;dynamometer to do the testing. You drive into the test bay and put your 
&gt;front or rear wheels on these big steel rollers which allows the testing to 
&gt;be done under load. I've never seen one that is set up for all-wheel drive 
&gt;vehicles. What gives? Do you have go to some special test center or 
&gt;something? Should I be at all concerned that they will screw something up if

&gt;I take my (soon to be mine, anyway) syncro in for the obligatory test 
&gt;required to transfer the title?

STOP!!  DON'T DO IT!  Damage to your van and the sop will happen!  
If you put a Syncro onto a 2 wheel dynamometer the front wheels will propel
the van right off the machine and into the nearest wall.  I don't know what
provisions they have in Seattle for all wheel drive vehicles, but other cars
(like Audi Quattros) would be in this same boat.  I suggest you better do
some investigating at the shops or with your emissions agency before you
expect to get tested.
