&gt;You Westie owners out there might be interested about why lighting a

&gt;The weekly science program &quot;We're Science&quot; heard on PRI stations, and
&gt;at www.umr_dot_edu/~science explains it on this week's program.
&gt;
&gt;Turns out you are vaporizing ammonia, then combining it with hydrogen,
&gt;which compresses it, drawing off heat, which liquifies the ammonia
&gt;again, releasing the hydrogen. Something like that. Seems that big
&gt;industry does most of their cooling using ammonia, not HFC based
&gt;compounds.

While having my (home) reefer repaired, I mentioned to the repairman that
my Dad still has a GE refigerator that he bought new in 1950 which still
works like new &amp; has never been serviced;  repairman sez 'yeh, the old ones
used ammonia and nitrogen (?) &amp; rarely go bad, but if they do they smell
horrible so the manufacturers switched to Freon, which never has worked as
well as the old systems'.
