Subject: Re: Campers: Request for General Information

&gt; Do any of you have a file containing information about different camper
&gt; &quot;models&quot;, and what equipment was actually included with each? I guess I'm
&gt; mostly interested in the second generation buses, but I'm curious about
&gt; earlier and later models.

Nope, no file.  I can tell you what my 81 Westfalia has in it, though.  Typical double-decker sleepers,
small propane/AC/DC fridge, 13.5 gallon water holding tank, electric water pump w/sink, two burner
propane stove.  Optional gasoline heater (necessity in cold climes).  Small combo clothes/3 shelf closet.
Rear overhead two compartment storage area.  One swing out table to serve the rear seat customers,
one for the front seat passengers.  Two front captain's (rotatable) bucket seats, which I think were
standard on any of the Vanagons.  Internal AC outlet usable when hooked up to city power through
external hookup (needed to run fridge on AC).

What else do you want to know?

Jack

PS - Sorry for the earlier bandwidthwasting repost, itchy mouse finger 8).
