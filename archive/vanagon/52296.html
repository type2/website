Subject:       Re: Syncro on the Dunes?

&gt; Check out http://www.islandnet_dot_com/~swright/vwimages.html for a Syncro Picture 
&gt; in the Dunes.  Shawn was able to host some pictures scanned from a Syncro 
&gt; brochure.  I found the brochure, Harry Yates did the scanning and now Shawn did 
&gt; the Web hosting.  Does this list get along or what!!!  We have now solved World 
&gt; Peace.  What's next , World Humger???  :-)  Is it Friday Yet?
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a picture of the much talked about, but never seen Tri-Star 
&gt; Syncro.  My apologies to Shawn if his Web hit count goes throught the roof!!
&gt; 
Knowing what kind of nuts you guys are, I chose to host the pics from 
outside my domain... I'll see if the ISP complains!

btw, I made some changes last night to expand the pages a bit. 
Nothing substantial yet, just outlines, but I plan to include a 
section on diesels, and one on Westfalias, with images covering both 
areas.Please feel free to send me anything you'd like to see posted 
on these topics.

Thx.
