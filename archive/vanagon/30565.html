Subject: re: eurovan/winnebago

&gt;
&gt;1995 VW/Winnebago Rialta.
&gt;list: $45,000        new asking price:  $41,500
&gt;has A/C, generator, microwave, propane stove &amp; propane furnace/heater,
&gt;shower &amp; toilet, and is wired for television (? that's what he said).
&gt;

I'm know I'm being picky, but I think these should be referred to as
Winnebago/Eurovans (or maybe just Winnebagos?) - clearly the Winnie portion
overwhelms the EV portion!
