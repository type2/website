  This message bounced when I tried to send earlier this morning. My 
  apologies to anyone who got it twice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;  Does anyone out there in list land have experience with taking dogs on trips
&gt;  that involve crossing the US - Canada border or the US - Mexican border?
&gt; 
&gt;  An enquiring puppy &lt;that doesn't like to get left at home&gt; wants to know...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Thanks in advance,
&gt;
