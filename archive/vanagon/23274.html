Subject:       Re: Propane

Hello Everyone.  I really believe in safety.  Propane is a very safe 
product under most conditions.  Why invite problems.  

While it is probable that for 99% of the people, nothing will go 
wrong, but there is still a slight chance of mishap.  With propane, it's 
a BIG mishap.  Propane is quite violent when it explodes, and I 
wouldn't want to be around to witness one.

The point I would like to make here is if you are running your van 
with the fridge on propane, and you get into an accident, why risk 
your lives, and the people rescueing you, as well as others for the 
sake of keeping a fridge cool?  I could live with soggy food, but not 
with the thought of driving a time bomb.  Besides, those lunch box 
size ice packs to a great job on long/hot drives. 

We are lucky to have a 3-way fridge, some manufacturers only make 
2-way.  We DO have an option to run *safely*, so why not do it?  So, 
when you stop you have to put the propane on and light the fridge.  
We do that all the time.  Gee, it takes us about a minute to do.  
When I'm travelling, I'm not in a hurry.

Ok, flame away, but at least I'll be travelling safely, and won't be 
endangering anyone.

Safely yours,
Harry.

&gt; &gt; Maybe the more important question is: why waste the propane when you
&gt; &gt; have another source of power that is immediately available and does
&gt; &gt; not tax any other resources (while the engine is on)?  am I missing
&gt; &gt; something?

&gt; I was addressing _safety_.
&gt; 
&gt; Does it make sense to cool with propane when underway? Actually it does 
&gt; have some advantages:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Most 3 way friges cool much better on propane than 12 volts.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. When stopping for lunch, etc. you don't have to remember to do 
&gt; anything or switch anything. It keeps cooling.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The almost 20 amp draw of the fridge on the alternator does draw some 
&gt; engine power and effect milage somewhat.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. The propane usage is relatively small.
