Subject:      Re: READ THIS..Re:&lt;Syncro/all&gt; fender l

&gt;&gt; a) Are there black ones available?
&gt;Actually, as it says on the web site, the fenders Helmut is arranging are
&gt;BLACK.
They are available in Black only.

&gt;&gt; b) What exactly are they made of?....plastic or rubber??
&gt;Good question.
I'm sure they are made of a kind of plastic like all wheel well extenders
offered by Volkswagen. Total weight of the four lips are about 3 kg,
rubber made lips should be heavier.

&gt;&gt; c) How exactly do they attach?
&gt;Good question.
It's German quality and they should fit. As I read Thomas Niksch's article
about 16&quot; Vanagons, I don't believe that they would fit on there. 16&quot; have
modified wheel wells. But Syncro and 2WD are equal.

&gt;&gt; d) Where can we see a picture/ read a description of them?
&gt;http://www.vanagon_dot_com/ (Click on 'Info', then 'Fender Lips'.)

&gt;&gt; e) How long do they tend to last?
&gt;Hmmm.  Depends if you're Derek Drew, probably.

&gt;&gt; d) Has anyone done business with Zeidler successfully before?? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Yup!  ('d' again?)
Should be answer by others than me.

&gt;would someone tell us if they're gonna fit on a late vanagon w/ the
&gt;fiberglass rocker trim??!!??
Try to get the information out of the picture. They are very thin and
as I know the body cladding, the lips should fit. But I haven't seen
the lips in nature and someone should check. As an option, I may
keep the first set of lips and, if they will fit, add the additional
to the shipment later on.
