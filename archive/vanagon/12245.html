Subject: Re: Cracked expansion tank

&gt;I replaced the tank several years ago for the same problem. Of 
&gt;course, it was pretty expensive for a plastic bottle.  Is there any
&gt; way to repair polyethylene (most glues don't stick)? 
&gt;
&gt;I see where someone else had this problem a month back. Is this a 
&gt;design defect in the tank? 
&gt;

I think there is a design defect. 

No, I don't think you can repair these. 

Everyone should buy a little pile of these for the rainy day when VW has to
drop out of the US market.
