Subject: Re:VWoC and H2O Heads


Hi fellow Canadians, and others

Just phoned VWoC customer service, 1-800-263-9507, to ask about policy on 
head replacement. Pretty obstinant about admitting anything was wrong with 
them. I asked about FTC/VWoA, he said, &quot;well that's the other side of the 
border, we don't have an FTC&quot;. Didn't admit this right away. Despite having 
merged with VWoA, they are still  VWoC and not bound by USA deals.
        They will review each case, with the regional rep. but did not 
indicate if compensation was available. He indicated that warranty claims 
were the only type likely to be entertained, and only if authorized 
parts/repairs had been done. ie under new car warranty or if they leaked 
again within 12 mo/20K km. He wouldn't acknowledge a defect exists, &quot;can't 
comment on that&quot;. I pressed him to say if any claims had been paid, ditto 
above, words carefully chosen, me: &quot;you mean you don't know or you won't 
tell me?&quot;, ditto again.
         His name was William Woo, feel free to drop my name when you call. 
Reminding him that I had sued them once, and won, slowed him down, as did 
mentioning this list and that I would be posting his response.  I am half 
seriously thinking of getting USA Maine registration on each van then 
getting the repairs done in New Hampshire, the effort would be worth $2000 
minimum I figure.   tim s. (aka. Grumpy)  

more to follow, now where's the fertilizer and that drum of furnace oil anyhow?
