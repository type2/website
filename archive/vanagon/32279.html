Subject: mail


I seem to be having a little trouble with my mail system.  I try to reply 
to the digest version of the list, and the mail system asks if I want to 
reply to all recipients.  I tell it no, but for some reason it seems to 
do it anyway.  Is this really happening?  Am I sending messages to 
everyone accidently?  Please let me know, and I apologize for cluttering 
up everyones mailboxes if it turns out I am.

Thanks,
Craig
