Subject: RE: VW AWNING


Tempting thought, not quite so much as the PVC pipe solution propounded 
here a little while back. When I first saw the ad I'd mentioned, I 
thought it might have been a VW tent... gotta find out where I packed my 
Campmor catalog and check out the car tents advertised there (WAY over my 
budget!)

&gt; Hey Michael, why not go with an awning made for your machine? VW CANVAS
&gt; specializes in such stuff. They have a side awning kit, with poles, ropes, and
&gt; stakes for 149.00 in stock color ($198 if you want custom--maybe something in
&gt; plaid or pazley?) I got a new cot for the upper bunk from them--nice folks.
&gt; When I wrote for a price list they sent one with polaroids of their
&gt; products--nice. Think when the time comes (with the cash) I will get my new
&gt; three window convas for the top from them.
