Subject: TriStar Service record

I have told you I was about to buy a 90 TriStar Syncro. I have a friend 
at the VW garage here, and we looked thru the service records on the 
car. Servicing seems to been made with right intervals, this is what 
dont belong to ordinary service:
*46000km: complete clutch is changed
*47000km: new starter
*58000km: new starter again
*60000km: engine dont run on all cylinders, spark plugs is changed
*from 1990-95: four boots is changed
*today it has 65000km on it.
What can I more tell? It was sold at 891215 Chassis no.24LG007995
