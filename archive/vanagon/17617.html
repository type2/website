Oh oh... I don't think you'll really want to subscribe to this list from 
CI$.  It's a high volume list, meaning 50+ messages a day are normal.  
Someone else said they subscribed on Friday, and already had 140 messages 
(Weekends are slow for the list).  If you still want to recieve it you 
have to send a message to:

listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

The message should say:

subscribe vanagon John

You can make the listserv send you only one large (~100-150k) digest a 
day by sending the following message to the listserv address:

set vanagon digest

I'm CCing this to you as well as the list so that all the helpful 
folks on the list know if I messed anything.
