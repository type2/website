Subject: Garcia

whoa.  First of all, the fact that Deadheads have been associated with drugs
has nothing to do with Garcia.  He is a wonderful musician and I am sad that 
when I get Cassidy rolling this summer I won't be able to take her to some 
Dead shows (but the music lives on!)  I don't consider myself a deadhead--I
am a respectful fan of the music and the band and I for one have never used any
drugs at a show or anywhere else.  I am offended that people associate Grateful
Dead fans and the band with substance abuse.  I have stickers for my bus to
honor Garcia, but I agree that a list sticker is not a place for that.  
	I am new to the list, and I am interested in a sticker when they are 
made.  HOw does that work?  Do you just send them out, how much are they, etc.

Amy :)
