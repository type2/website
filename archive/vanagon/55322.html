I wish I'd had more than a few copies made! I've already received more 
requests than I have copies.  I will have to sort through my e-mail and see 
who asked for what first, and then I'll contact you directly if you're 
getting one.  I will try to get more copies made when I have time, and will 
post them to the list then.  (Or maybe a couple of the people who are 
getting these copies will volunteer to make copies for others?)
