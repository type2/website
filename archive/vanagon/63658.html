Subject: &quot;82 Diesel suddenly runs warm

To: Vanagon Digest

Could use some help on this one.

Been original owner of an '82 diesel vanagon, now at 179K miles.  Except
under a few very rare (and understandable) circumstances, it has never =

gauge.  Coupla weeks ago, wife noticed that at freeway speeds, it ran
warmer, at the right hand edge of the led, but cooled down if she slowed
down to say 50-55.


So - I ordered a new thermostat from VW, and had it installed with fresh
phosphate free antifreeze.  On the way home I noticed that the engine =

now runs steady state at the right hand edge of the LED all the time.

Now - although this probably isn't &quot;overheat&quot; it is warmer than it has =

for the last 15 years.

I don't think that the electric radiator fan is an issue here, I don't
think the current temp is hot enough to trigger the fan, and the last =

Coolant was last changed 2 years ago, and looking at the coolant tanks,
showed no signs of rust in the cooling system.

Thanks
