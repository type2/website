A friend used spray on Urethane foam. The kind that you put on thin and
it grows, like 5 to 1. It will also act as a vapor shield.
Make sure to apply to a well painted surface, lightly sanded to give
&quot;tooth&quot; for the foam.
Enjoy...Ken

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; i saw a recent thread on the vanagon list where someone had removed
&gt; his
&gt; headliner and wanted to know what to use for insulation up there.
&gt; Since i
&gt; didnt see any responses i thought i'd crosspost this to both lists.
