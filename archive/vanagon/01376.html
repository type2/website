	I have a '84 that I have pretty much decided that when the engine
does go, I will replace it with something else.  I helped a pal put a
Toyota 3TC (corolla) engine into a '74.  I had been talking about
upgrading my '72 that had been so many headaches and I talked him into
putting a new engine into his and selling me his old engine.  Probably the
hardest part of the deal was fabricating a new engine hangar.  This was
the bar that slung under the engine to give it support.  We discovered
from a person who didn't make one that it was a very important thing. 
This person had a pinto type (newer, better, bigger) engine installed.  I
would not reccomend this conversion due to it's amazing lack of power and
incredible levels of vibration.  The 3TC engine was a very good match for
my friend because he wanted a dependable, efficient auto.  the 3TC wasn't
an upgrade in terms of power but it was really quit and he gets about 30
mpg.  I have been looking at putting a small v6 in my vanagon and having
some custom metalwork done to raise the rear deck for more engine
clearance.  A guy locally, put a big v8 in and his deck is only a couple
inches below the rear window-line.  A little excessive perhaps.  I wore my
KEP catalog ragged before we actually did it.  You should probably get
permission from the wife to use her car or get a bus pass.  :)  It took us
several months to get everything lined up.
