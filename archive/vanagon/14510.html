(discussing rear carriers and broken bolts)
--Wolfram v.Kiparski said:--
&gt; 
&gt; This happened to me, years ago, on my '71 Bus.  since I was broke, stranded
&gt; in a desolate region, and didn't have the proper tools to fix this, I
&gt; abandoned the Bus.
Ouch! Moment of silence!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Query -- can I put on one of those bug engine -to- bus
&gt; &gt;adapters (the ones that bolt to the oil pump cover), 
&gt; 
&gt; If had had this option back then, I would have used it.  I don't trust
&gt; those weird rear engine carriers, but if it means saving your Bus, go for
&gt; it.  then fix the baby once you get home safely.

Are you familiar enough with the hunk of metal to tell if it will
fight with the case that already has mounting points? That's my
main concern -- if it doesn't conflict, I don't see anything wrong
with using it for a couple of weeks around town....

Anyone's input would be apperciated.
