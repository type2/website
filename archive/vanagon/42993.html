Subject: Westy questions

Hi Mike,
  I hope I can answer some of your questions.Date: Fri, 24 May 96 17:50:07 PDT


My 1980 Westy has developed a propane leak.

*** Be careful, we don't want to see your camper in flames.  Anyway,  I'm
not sure about the rest of the country, but in  Massachusetts the propane
tank MUST be checked and/or replaced every 12 years.  I just had mine
checked at a local propane dealer and he had it tested and recertified.
The parts for you tank can be brought at most propane dealers.  They use
standard fittings.

The luggage rack seal were replaced (with a kit from some company in
Malibu). Now, when the wind hits just right while driving on the freeway,
the whole front of the rack starts vibrating really loud. The seal work
great on the pop-top but I'm thinking that something a little stiffer may be
better up front. Any ideas on fixing this?

**Hmm,  I've used the same kit for my '83 Westy without a problem.  Is the
rack bolted down tight.  I know this sounds obvious but hey, you never
know.  Those 'L' shaped brakets sometimes get bent.  Its worth the effort
top check it out.

What is the small hole just to the right of the steering column for.? My
wife who normally drives a Sube, make quite a spark when she stuck her key
into it. Is there anyway to do anything useful with it?

**  That is a European cigerette lighter hole.  I've seen them in buses
starting in the '70s.  Hella makes a map light that will fit in there.
Other than that it just space.  Hope this helps.  Take care.  BTW, are you
in LiMBO?  If not wanna join?
