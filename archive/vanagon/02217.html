&gt;When I turn the ignition switch, the engine merrily turns
&gt;over but won't catch.  The thing is, I still have a wire
&gt;running from the ignition wire to the battery.  When I touch
&gt;that to the battery, it starts immediately.

ok. i think i might have found something.
in the bentley book wiring diagram for the 76 bus, the ignition switch
shows a bunch of stuff coming out. my guess is that you removed the
red/black wire that runs from the switch to the starter motor when you
hooked up the relay. now the problem is that in the wiring diagram, the
red/black wire is also tied in to a red/white wire that runs all the
over to the fuel injection control unit (terminal 86a). my guess is that
you've got the red/black wire hanging loose (terminal 50 on the ignition
switch) and the fuel injection is getting NO power at all. there is no
telling WHERE the connection is made between the ignition switch wire
and the fuel injection wire.

one way to find out is to test the cpu for 12v at that terminal when you
turn on the ignition switch. then test it again with that wire touched
to the battery. if no, then yes, you've cut your power to the cpu. :)

hope it helps.
