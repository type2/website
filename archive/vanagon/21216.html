 &gt; After calling everyone I could think of at VWUS, I finally got in
 &gt; touch with their Technical Service Department (as opposed
 &gt; to their Customer Service Department). Their suggestion...have
 &gt; the dealer order a set...
 &gt; 
 &gt; DUH! Sure I can do that...but why...ok...enough venting for now.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Here's my plan. I'll order the parts I don't already have. Once
 &gt; or twice a week, I'll photocopy each section of the manual. Then
 &gt; I'll send off the photocopy to a EV owner. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; What I envision is sort of a &quot;chain letter&quot;. I need a list of names
 &gt; and smail addresses of EV owners on the list. I'll send the photocopy
 &gt; of the manual section to the person at the top of the list who
 &gt; will make a photocopy of the section, and then send it to the next
 &gt; person on the list...and so on...and so on...I'll be on the bottom
 &gt; of the list so that when the last person finishes making a copy the
 &gt; master photocopy can be returned to me...
 &gt; 
 &gt; Ok? 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Let me know what you EVers think.
