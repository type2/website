Subject: Center Console for Vanagon CHEAP!

Thought I would contribute to the vanagonlist a little product information.
Found a console in K-Mart (K-mart sucks?)that works great in the Bus. Made
by Steelhorse Automotive (American made-imagine that!) floor mounted, Fits
mini vans trucks etc.,that have bucket seats. It just sits on the floor,it
moves around very little, if its a problem, I guess you could put velco
stick tape on bottom with the clinging side next to carpet. Rocks abit, the
floor in uneven in the vanagon. Has 4 cup holders, several slots for CD's,
note pads/pen, coin holders and very small ice chest, and even a hidden
compartment(Humm-which any theft or cop could easily find.). I even found
mine in tan,which matches the interior of '85 westy quite well. Cost 70
bucks.(would be $500 if VW sold it!) I have no interest in Steelhorse
Automotive or K-Mart and except no disclamers or any other legal
garb(Humm-maybe they will pay me if 1000's of you VW-bus owners go out and
buy them--NAAH). Summary, it worked well on a long road trip (it was nice
to have a place to put all my stuff and drink.)It does stop up the
walkway,but did really bother me.They come in a few different colors,
black, blue,tan,maybe others? Checkmee out.
