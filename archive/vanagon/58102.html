Subject: Part-Out or sell  RANT!

Listees,

  I'm having a very funny feeling about the different things that are 
being said on the list.  There is a large population of members that 
&quot;Complain&quot; about Vanagons being parted out as opposed to being offered 
to the list and sold to be put back on the road.

  In the last week I've posted to good bargin vehicles to the list's.  
One to the type 2 list and 1 to the Vanagon list.  Oin both instances I 
got ZERO response.  A 69 Single cab for a $1000.00, and no response?  I 
posted I wanted to sell it instead of part it but I don't have ALL the 
control in the shop I work in, so on Friday the single cab was pated 
out:-(.

  Then I post this posting;

  I have a 86 Vanagon FS.

  It needs a Steering rack,  Front Brakes, Shocks, Windsheild and a High 
beam light.

  The rear tires are good, but the fronts are thin.

  The Vans been sitting for about 6 Months.  The rear seat folds tio a 
bed, and the
middle seat folds forward too!

  I want to sell this van right away, I want $2500.00 for it.  DMV fees 
are paid too.

  E-mail me for more details or info.

   
  Again I got zero response to this too?  I guess this 86 will get 
parted out too.  

  My biggest gripe is that there seems to be a Large amount of sniveling 
when someone from the list &quot;scoops&quot; up something that some &quot;WannaVanner&quot; 
&quot;Might&quot; have bought.  Then when there are good deals posted nobody seems 
to have interest?

  I just felt that I needed to post due to the fact that 1 Good Deal has 
allready been missed and that If there's no response on the 86 I have to 
sell it too will get turned into a pile of parts :-(
