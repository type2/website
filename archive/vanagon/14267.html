&gt; How about Yosemite in Spring. They'll be lots of water, spectacular water 
&gt; falls, cool days, cooler nights, and HOT SHOWERS, Martha. (At Curry 
&gt; Village for $1, nice, clean, white tile.)
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen it snow in Yosemite in April, lightly, usaully, but late May 
&gt; would be almost sure fire nice weather. How about May 26, 27, 28. Or is 
&gt; that Memorial Day?

How bout May 19th?  That is when the GNATT tour is scheduled to start, and
it starts in Yosemite!  More information on GNATT coming soon, so stay
tuned...
