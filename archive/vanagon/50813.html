&lt;&lt; The heated mirrors on my 1986/2 westy syncro don't appear to heat. I
 don't know which circuit they belong to. I can't find any reference to
 them in the Bentley manual. 
 Can anyone give me guidance?

They are engaged by the rear window defroster circuit.  Turn on the reart
defroster, wait a few minutes and fell the mirrors for warmth.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
