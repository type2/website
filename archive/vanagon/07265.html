&gt;   P.J. Bushrat writes late Tuesday:

&gt; &gt;  The extra length of the long Eurovan is very apparent.
&gt; 
&gt; Curious.  Dave, is the chassis the same as the long-wheel-base 
&gt; Transporter or have they stretched it even more?  I don't know 
&gt; if the LWB is shipped to the 'states: please advise.
&gt; 
&gt;   If what my co-worker tells me is true it is the long wheelbase Transporter.
    He says we have only received short wheel base ones until the Euro-Bago.

    P.S. Air conditioning is for sissies - besides, it not part of the &quot;Be-Here
    -Now&quot; philosophy that is essential to _real_ VW Bus wandering. (this should
    provoke a response; hee, hee, hee, grin)
