&gt; one's own camper/van from the US to Europe, and then ship it back
&gt; when the trip was over.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know what it costs to ship cars back and forth?

&gt; Ric,
	I would think that the round trip boat ride for a bus trans 
Atlantic should be less than $5,000. Iwouldn't do this with a '68 or 
later bus as the EPA will make you re-certify your bus for emissions when 
it lands back in the States.   You do not want to have to deal with 
that.  It would probably be more fun to just rent rooms on a European 
trip.  It is not like there is any &quot;wilderness&quot; there to camp in.  And 
they will insist on your leaving your firearms back at home.  Gary Gibson
