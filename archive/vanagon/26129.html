&gt; 
&gt; The small outlet brass pipe or fitting going to a rubber fuel line to
&gt; the carburetor had popped out of the fuel pump. It is apparently just
&gt; a pressure fit.

I have heard of the same fittings falling out of the carb itself.  Anyone 
have this problem?  Glad to here there was no fire.
