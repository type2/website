&gt; Well, I suppose you could substitute a dual-spray &quot;thief-cleaning&quot; &quot;solution&quot;
&gt; by having one spray bottle filled with an ammonia-based cleaner, and
&gt; the other with a chlorine-based one.  The switch would trigger spraying
&gt; from both sources.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who wish for a more passive attack, you could just install one
&gt; of those disposable cameras to take mug shot of the &quot;alleged&quot; perp.
What about a valve that directs co into the vanagon complete with a 
video recorder snapping the last moments?
