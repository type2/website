Subject: Selling the Fridge

Well, after testing the fridge out for a couple of days, I think I am
going to stick with my old, compressor driven one.  To refresh your memories,
I grabbed an electric fridge (I think it is a Dometic) from a 79 Westy in
the junkyard last weekend because it was too cheap to pass up.

It works fine... at least as well as it should.  It did chill a gallon of
water at room temperature down to 36 degrees after 24 hours - it just takes
a long time to cool down.  I read the bit on refrigerators on the gopher
server, and it said that for this type of fridge it is best to pack it with
frozen food and already-chilled drinks.  I think if you did that it would
be useable.  As far as I can tell, it is 12V only.

Anyway, I paid $25 + tax + $1 admission + drove 20 miles to the junkyard,
removed that puppy and cleaned it up.  I think $30 is a fair price for it.

Anyone wanna buy this fridge from me for $30?  For those of you in the Bay
area, I will be in Davis the weekend before thanksgiving and I could bring
it with me.  Otherwise, I guess I'll just use it to keep drinks cold in the
garage.  To those outside of Calif. I apologize, but shipping this beast is
out of the question, methinks.
