Home Brew.  Easiest source of parts is Radio Shack.  They sell a Light
Emitting Diode (LED) with a built in flasher circuit.  You need one of those
and a 330 ohm resistor, 1/4 or 1/2 watt should do.  Shouldn't cost you more
that a buck or two plus wire. Wire can be small gauge, 20 gauge or so is fine.
 Run a lead from the glow plug buss up to your dash.  Be sure and follow the
usual appropriate techniques for stringing the wire, and put a low value fuse
in the line as close to the connection to the Glow Plug Buss as possible in
case of a short in the line at a later date.  Wire the resistor between the
line from the glow plug buss and the + lead of the LED.  Wire the other lead
of the LED to ground.  Mount it wherever convenient.  I  have a spare spot in
the center of the dash just to the right of the yellow glow plug wait light
that I have been meaning to use.  Thats it.  The light should be on whenever
your glow plug buss is &quot;hot&quot; and provide positive indication of power on the
buss.
Harvey
