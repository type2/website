Subject: Re: 1972 (engine almost in?!?!?) Westfalia

&gt;engine and engine compartment, I don't see how anyone can install the
&gt;engine with the fan housing on, much less the tin.  Like you say, you
&gt;have to move the engine back to clear the input shaft, and things hit
&gt;the rear of the engine compartment.  Why oh why couldn't they have made
&gt;it removable like the earlier busses?!?!?  :)

Always learning, always learning.....
It is possible to put the type 4 engine in the '73 with the fan housing on.  
I have always done it that way (but probably won't anymore).  It is a tight 
fit, and you have to have the engine/trans bolts all set up right, but it 
goes.  It always scares me when I do this, since that trans shaft looks so 
fragile....

I think we can thank the gov't for the change to the non-removable rear 
apron.  '73 was 'the year of the bumper', and I think in order to meet the 
crash tests they had to reinforce this area.  Anybody know for sure?
