&gt;original rounded bus design with the Brick design which judging from the

&gt;went with the flat face if they knew as early as 48 that the rounded

yup. real simple reason: look at the rabbit. the vanagon was designed to
match the angular flat features of the rabbit and jetta and other cars of
the period (early 80's). in the same way that the eurovan was rounded to
match the newer rounded golf and jetta and passats, etc.
