&lt;&lt; If you knows of another source for a front table, let me know. I've
 never heard of one. I know that I
 talked to the owner of Euroamerica about a year ago and he mentioned
 that he might start making them, but in our 
 last conversation (when I ordered a fridge vent cover--very nice snf
 about $8.00) he said that it wasn't in his plans.

FWIW, the dia. of the table arm on a '75-'79 westy will fit the mount on the
drivers seat pedestal, I believe......then again, I guess you could always
use the rear V-gon table up front.....
But making a table would be easy - some alum pipe (it doesn't have to be the
heavy galv. steel)  the underside&quot;table bracket&quot; can be had at any plumbing
supply store, and the top is just plywood laminated w/ formica.  Drill a
couple holes in the arm, and thread in some large wing nuts to lock into
position.
Simple, functional, decent looking, and best of all CHEAP, and something just
about anybody can do themselves...
