Subject: tires(picture of dead horse getting beat)

I promise I have read the FAQs, just one quickie. Sears is checking to
see if they can order me a set of mich 2-ply side reinforced tires. cost
$77.00 in the catalog (they said they would see if I could get a better
price) anyway my question is: if I go to a 205/70 (bigger than stock)
would I lose a noticible amount of power in the 1st to 2nd gear range?
