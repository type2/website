Hi Scott, having just come back from the maiden voyage with my 85 Westy I
can report that the fridge (and stove) worked perfectly on 12V and propane.
No noise, propane made ice cubes every day and moves between campsites at
12V kept the fridge adwquately cold.
BTW, my fridge doesn't seem to work on 120V and given the way it works in
the other modes I'm not even going to try to fix it.

Harry
