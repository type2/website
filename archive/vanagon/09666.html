Subject: Wanted! 1600cc Vanagon Engine Case- REALLY!

Ian Abbott asks:
&gt;	What I'm seeking is the 1600cc (gas, carb) Vanagon case. 
&gt;	And NO, it's NOT just a beetle or &quot;universal&quot; case!
&gt;

Sorry this reply is a bit late, I got unsubscribed over Xmas and have only 
just caught up with the backlog. 
I know the engines you're talking about and yes, they have oil filters and 
hydraulic valves and other good points, but are you really sure you want one 
of these? It would be expensive to ship a used engine from here, and what 
would you do about parts? Most are slightly different than type1 parts and 
they are expensive, even in Europe, as they are no longer made and were 
never made in the huge numbers that type1 parts were (still are). As far as 
I know, nobody bothers using these engines in the UK bcause of these 
reasons. It is cheaper to modify a type1 case. Or how about a new Mexican 
engine? I think they are based on the same design but with an upright fan 
and would probably cost less than rebuilding a used engine.
There is another reason to avoid a used 1600 Vanagon engine. They were only 
available in panel vans and pick-ups, that tended to get thrashed to death 
by lead-footed brickies and plumbers, so by the time the van hits the 
scrapyard it is completley knackered. The early air-cooled vanagons had a 
reputation for being fragile, but this is probably a result of the abuse 
they suffered as workhorses. Campers and buses lead a much easier life but 
almost all had 2000cc motors.
If I haven't put you off yet, I can dig up some phone numbers of possible 
sources for you but the chances of finding a good engine (remember, they 
haven't been available for about 10 years) are pretty slim.
