&gt;I am looking for a Carb replacement in my 1980 Vanagon.  The current one is
a
&gt;2 bbl Weber, but has no power in the lower RPMs.  Has anyone had any
&gt;experience in this area?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the assistance.

Find a proper FI system and restore it.  Nothing else works properly for any
lenght of time.  Especially if you live in an area where it gets cold.
