Subject: Cruise control progress


Today I talked to the Equus cruise control Technical Service dept. 
(800-544-4124) and they were super helpful!  I talked with Gene--he has 
installed the system on his 84 westy and had some detailed modifications to 
make the system work.  Equus does not recommend the system for the vanagon 
because of the low vacuum levels supplied by the engine.

The vacuum on the vanagons is not enough to run the cruise control so at a 
minimum a vacuum canister with check valve needs to be installed to build up 
a resevoir of vacuum to power the servo.  Gene recommended to call Napa and 
ask for part no. 250-6019 from the Perfect Circle catalog.  It will probably 
look like a can with two ports on it.  It also has a check valve so that 
vacuum can be 'acumulated' inthe canister.  For junkyard scavengers, look 
for late model GM's or call automotive heating and A/C types.  It is 
IMPORTANT that the canister have two vacuum fittings and that the flow only 
goes one way.  If you suck on one side you should be able to feel it on the 
other port in only one orientation because there is a check valve in the can 
to permit only one way flow.  Even with the canister, operation at altitude 
is still questionable.

Gene suggested hooking up the vacuum feed line to where the line goes 
forward to the power brake booster.  Right now, mine is taping off the idle 
stabilizer valve connection to the inlet air distributor.  That may be a low 
and inconsistent source of vacuum.

Gene also said that a vacuum pump is to powerful.  They typically supply 
18-20&quot; of steady vacuum and the unit only needs about 10-16&quot;.  Using a 
vacuum pump could result in a stuck valve and an inadvertent full throttle 
condition.  Yeuch.

Considering the above two scenarios, I think that after I move to Utah, I'll 
be modifying my cruise control to have its own independant vacuum pump, but 
will run it through a vacuum canister with a pressure relief valve.  This 
way I'll be able to have a steady supply of strong but meterable vacuum. 
  The vacuum pump will be hooked up to the canister which will be hooked up 
to the cruise control servo.  If the vacuum becomes to strong for the servo, 
the pressure relief valve will allow some air into the system reducing the 
level of vacuum.  Having the canister in line will reduce the systems 
sensitivity to valve operation and make the vacuum level more consistent. 
 By hooking up a vacuum gauge on the exit of the canister, I'll be able to 
set the release point for the relief valve.  This should allow the servo to 
operate at altitude.  For safety sake, the power to the vacuum pump could 
also be controlled by a pressure sensor on the canister.  At a minimum, the 
power supply to the pump could be in series with the power supply to the 
servo--kill both with one wire yank at the fuse block.

If all this fails, Gene recommended an all electric system made by Rostra 
(previously Dana) in North Carolina, 910-276-4853

BTW, the stock VW cruise control system for the vanagons has a vacuum system 
independant of the engine.  It has its own vacuum pump.

I've mentioned several companies here, but have no affiliation with or 
interests in them.
