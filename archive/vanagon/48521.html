So then, Tim P. said:

&gt;Me too. Only I own a GL. I looked for a weekender MV when I bought the
&gt;GL, and called VW's 800 number to locate a 5-speed new on the lot (this
was
&gt;fall of 94). Only weekenders they showed on their computer were two
&gt;automatics in Hawaii at the time! So I bought the GL. Looked at the
               ^^^^^^

Muchachos y muchachas (or kanes &amp; wahines, as the case may be...)!
Well, I'm there (HI, that is) and yes, it's hard to believe, but
they do have MV Weekenders here, which seems pretty, uh, kind of a
waste because no matter where you are on Oahu you're no more than
an hour or so away from home (and trust me, you don't want to be
shipping vehicles inter-island just to go camping on a whim...).
Anyway, they have a surprising number of MV's in both the Weekender
and non-Weekender flavor.  And I would concur w/ Tim's finding that
HI was probably the last place to sell all their Weekenders as new,
as I recall seeing at least one at Ala Moana VW when I was visiting
family a couple years ago.  You all should count your blessings, cuz
good VW service (air or H2O) is pretty hard to come by, and this
humid climate really bites, not to mention the salt in the air....

Oh, so anyway, I'll add my $0.02 worth to the original thread and
say that a couple weekends ago I had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of driving to
Sacto (Sacramento, CA) not once, but twice, in 100+ degree temps.
The first time around I took my wife's GLI w/ reworked suspension.
The second time around I took my MV, and I'm here to tell you that
the MV was a hands down winner; if you've got to drive long miles/
hours, you might as well be comfortable while you're doing it.

Aloha,
Norman isn't remote access great? Leong
