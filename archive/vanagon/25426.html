Before I left last weekend, I replaced the rubber flex lines in my '67
brake system. &quot;Lovely&quot;, I thought. &quot;My brakes will be prefect now&quot;,
since, nothing else leaked or anything.
WRONG!!!!!
Apparently, all this new unrestricted flow blew out my master cylinder,
and all 6 wheel cylinders!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ARGH!!!!!
my master cylinder then proceeded to empty itself over a preriod of
merely a few hours, and all 4 tires were covered with the tell-tale
drips.
Needless to say, I had a rather thrilling trip home, and back, where my
new parts are waiting.
Anyway, I was just curious as to whether anyone else had had such a
gross reaction to a &quot;fix&quot;. 
I guess my moral in all this is- always leave plenty of shakedown time
after a repair before a trip, and always
Anything you must fix will break something else...
