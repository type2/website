Sami (and anyone else who might happen to have a VDO catalogue). Here is
the # on the &quot;pictograph&quot; installation guide that came with the dual sender:
5 350 015. Does any one knwo what might be the difference between  a
0-80psi sender and a 0-150 psi sender. What if they were mixed with the
wrong gauge?

Are the pressure readings a &quot;true&quot; reading of the pressure before or after
going into the guts of the engine?


TIA - David C.
