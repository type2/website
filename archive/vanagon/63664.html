Subject: help

I am new to this listserv and also new to Vanagons, but I am in the
initial stages of purchasing a Westie.  I live in Alaska and Westies that
are for sale are few and far between.  I have found a nice 83' with a
sound body and 100K on the engine.  The owner wants $8000.  I think that
is high, but I have no idea how high.  It is not an automatic and it does
not have air.  If anyone can help me on the pricing I would be grateful.
Thanks. Mike.
