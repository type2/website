Subject: Re: Camping at Disney World

&gt;Has anyone ever camped on the Disney property (at Fort Wilderness, not
&gt;actually _ in_ the Magic Kingdom, although that would be interesting if you
&gt;could drive your VW that far.) Is it decent? It's expensive--$42-$49 a night.
&gt;Was it worth it?

I stayed there about 25 years ago, and remember it as being wonderful.  Of
course I was 10 then.

There were nightly campfires with stories, canoe trips through the forests,
a monorail to the Magic Kingdom...

&gt; PS-Disney World in FL, not Disneyland in CA )I don't have time this
&gt;vacation to drive that far).

Disney World California is tiny, and surrounded by urban sprawl.  Supposedly
the situation made ol' Walt so furious that he made sure he'd never be
crowded in when he built his next park.
