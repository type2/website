Aiee, it seemed like a simple matter. Set the valves, change the spark plugs 
(which ARE at insane angles in the Type IV engine)... then to change the point and 
condenser. Heck, let's pull the distributor out altogether.

Engine turns, then kind of hiccups. Had one good backfire. I guess I'll try it
with the distributor where I think it might be, then move it a few degrees
and try it again, and again... this has not been a good day!
