Subject:       RE: Aircooled Redline?

&gt; I've heard 4400 RPM from several sources, including a VW dealer.
&gt; 
&gt; The critical part is supposedly the bearing journals in the case. The
&gt; crank hammers them pretty bad at or above that. Then the oil pressure
&gt; goes, then the bearings go, then... take cover.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if a balanced crank would make the engine able to
&gt; rev higher than that? If not, what else would if need? Ignorant
&gt; minds want to know-- mine in this case.

Interesting.  I've got a balanced crank as well.  You would think if 
the bearings are what fail, the balanced crank should help overcome 
that.  Maybe that's why it'll do 11,000RPM... &lt;BIG GRIN!&gt;
