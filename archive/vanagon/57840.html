Subject: Heat/Fresh Air Cables broke



Well, as I got inside my dash to fix my headlight problem, I realized 
that not only is the Fresh Air Cable broken, but now the heater cable is 
broke.  I can pull it with a tool, and since it is spring I may just 
leave the heat off.  Though it is really a hassle to get in there to turn 
the heat on/off.  

What is it like to replace the control cables for the heat levers?  Where 
could I get the cables?  

If I can't replace them, then I may attempt to just rig them up with a 
wire attachment.  Though I would like to replace them, now that it is 
warm and I could have some time in the nice weather.  If I ignore it, 
I'll hate myself next fall.  

Kyle
