Subject: RE: Alloy wheel deal

You are right the off set will probably be different. VW and Audi put the
off set right on the wheels. I don't remember what letter they use but it
is the same as is shown in the parts film.

&gt;	are you aware that the Audi 5000 is a front wheel drive car??
&gt;
&gt;	the off-set is totally opposite from rear wheel drive vehicles such as
&gt;Vanagons...
&gt;	the incorrect off-set will cause numerous problems such as strange tire
&gt;wear, incorrect wheel bearing loading ( premature failure...), may
&gt;affect handling...
&gt;
&gt;	so before you buy, check with a tire/wheel expert to see if the
&gt;difference in off-set will work on your Vanagon...
&gt;
&gt;	I personally would not do it...
