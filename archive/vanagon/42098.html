I think I've discovered a new source of gas leaks.  At least, the shop
it happened at had never seen it before, and I certainly haven't.  As
they were pulling it into the shop (or just after, exact chronology
isn't clear), that disc-shaped spot on the rear of the carb fell out.
This translates to, among other things, a serious vacuum leak.  They
fixed it by expoxying the disc back into place.

That's probably not the best solution, and I kind of wish they'd told
me about it rather than just fixing it (I'd probably have told them to
put a new carb on instead), but everything seems to be working at the
moment.

Weird.
