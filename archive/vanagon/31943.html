&gt; Subject: ? about cold weather and oil pressure
&gt; Message-ID: &lt;Pine.3.89.9601040852.A24577-0100000_at_indy1&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; It was about 4 degres Faren. this morning on my drive in. I let my 87 
&gt; Vanagon warm up about 10 minutes before heading out. About 10 miles down 
&gt; the road my oil light/buzzer came on while slowing down. I goosed it and 
&gt; the light/buzzer went off. This happened several times. I checked the oil 
&gt; level and it looks OK. Probably have 2500 miles since the last change. 
&gt; 10-40 as I recall. 
&gt; 
&gt; Any recommendations on oil when changing it soon or other ideas??. We will 
&gt; probably have pretty cold weather here for a while (Indiana).
&gt; 
&gt; Peace,

Check if it's a FRAM (or other non-VW) filter - I test drove an '87 
which did this, and the problem disappeared with a VW filter. Also 
has happened on my Jetta, but not since switching to VW filters...
Around here, I get them for $5.50 CDN, so it doesn't pay to go with 
the FRAM...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
