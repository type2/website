I don't know, Lisa, I have never had all those problems with
&quot;peripherals&quot;. Thirteen VW over the last 35 years and I've never had even
a crack in the dash. Changed one fuel pump, no broken door handles,
latches, etc. Upholstery has held up very well. But then I have had very
few serious problems of any kind with my vehicles, many with over 100k
miles. I do very little maintenance other than filters, oil, spark plugs,
wash and wax. I do drive the hell out of them.
