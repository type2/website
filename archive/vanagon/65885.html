Subject:      Raising '83.5 for CV work

In the archives I have found a couple of references to using jack stands to
support a Vanagon while performing CV joint work. I don't have jack stands
at the moment and since my driveway is on a slight incline I would prefer
to use my good quality ramps which elevates the rear by eight inches. Is
there a downside to immobilizing the rear wheels and using the
aforementioned ramps over jack stands?
