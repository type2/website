&gt;2.- 1987 Vanagon Synchro, good interiors, Central A/C, a minor dent on the
&gt;    sliding door, engine sounds good but has some hesitation, previous owner
&gt;    fixed the rust but you can notice the &quot;bondo work&quot; on the van. Price -&gt;
&gt;    $5,900

This would be my choice out of the list you provided.  It seems from the
variety of vans on you list you might be able to use a quick synopsis of
Vanagon models available in the USA.  I'll leave out the Westfalia options
off the list since you didn't mention a particular interest in them.

1980 air cooled 2.0 liter
1981 air cooled 2.0 liter
1982 air cooled 2.0 liter, 1.6 liter diesel option
1983 air coolde 2.0 liter, 1.6 liter diesel option
1983-1/2 water cooled 1.9 liter gasoline boxer, Digijet fuel injection
1984 water cooled 1.9 liter gasoline boxer, Digijet fuel injection
1985 water cooled 1.9 liter gasoline boxer, Digijet fuel injection
1986 water cooled 2.1 liter gasoline boxer, Digifant fuel injection
1986-1/2 water cooled 2.1 liter gasoline boxer, Digifant F.I., Syncro GL
option starts
1987 water cooled 2.1 liter gasoline boxer, Digifant F.I., Syncro GL option
available
1988 water cooled 2.1 liter gasoline boxer, Digifant F.I., no Syncros
1989 water cooled 2.1 liter gasoline boxer, Digifant F.I., Syncro GL option
available
1990 water cooled 2.1 liter gasoline boxer, Digifant F.I., Syncro option
available
1991 water cooled 2.1 liter gasoline boxer, Digifant F.I., Syncro option
available

In addition to this list, I remember seeing a much more detailed year-by-year
description of Vanagons on the WWW somewhere, bu don't remember where.

So, if you're looking for a Syncro, you should focus on the 1986 &amp; newer
vans.  Good luck!  If anyone cares to add a little more detail (or
corrections) to the rough list above, I'd like to see it.
