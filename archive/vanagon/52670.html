Subject: Re: shipping interior answer!

Robert (and anybody else interested),

Well, the news is in and it's not good :-(

Everything is too big for UPS to handle. I even tried packing everything
in seperate boxes. That left Greyhound and the commercial trucker of
your choice. Both were fairly comparable, which came to roughly $300 not
including any packaging materials. This was for the entire interior
including both front seats, middle and back seats and all panels. I was
planning on packing three boxes. One with the rear seat and all panels,
one with the middle seat, and one with both front seats. The price
wouldn't change that much no matter how you packed it though. Most of
the price resulted from the size, not the weight. Also, this was to ship
it from Cincinnati, Ohio to Teaneck, New Jersey!! Somebody did recommend
a furniture moving company, I didn't have any luck around here, but you
never know... 

Hope this helps somebody, it sure didn't help me :-(
