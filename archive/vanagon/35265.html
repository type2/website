Subject: vw's wanted for pepsi commercial


Ok, now that I got your attention, it's bugs, not busses, but the
rest of it is true.  Am mentioning it here, because I know some
of you have bugs, see them for sale, know of someone selling one, etc.

My VW repair shop need bugs (69-74 std.) in or near the San Francisco
Bay area.  He has a contract to refurbish about 20 of them for a
Pepsi commercial/bug-giveaway, and needs them asap, so told him I'd
try and help out by posting here.  He's willing to pay $300-$1,000,
depending on the condition, and it's not crucial that the car be
running.  Good body would help.

If interested, tell him you saw Martha's post on the internet, and
phone:

The Bug Stop
