&gt;&gt;As i look at the damaged piston sitting on a table i see a round
&gt;&gt;port for a pin to connect to the the rod. This circle is gouged
&gt;&gt;above and in the shape of a crescent moon. Actually both circles in
&gt;&gt;the piston, on either end of the pin have this crescent gouge on
&gt;&gt;top of the piston.  The rings and piston in between are also
&gt;&gt;scratched but i suspect some dage here removng the piston.
&gt;&gt;Evidence shows the motor ran on three cyliders.

&gt;&gt;Query:

&gt;&gt;1. This is a tough one but for curiosity what might have caused this
&gt;&gt;type of damage described above.
     The &quot;crescent gouge&quot; that you see on the side of the piston was
     probably inflicted by the disassembler. He probably used a socket or
     large punch to knock the wrist pin out of the piston. The marks are
     where he missed. D'oh!

&gt;&gt;2. I am debating replacing one cylinder and piston versus all four
&gt;&gt;simultaneously or purchasing a complete rebuild kit (i.e. valves
&gt;&gt;cyliders etc).  I am curious for past experience making this
&gt;&gt;kinda decision.  Is replacing one cylinder and piston a mistake?

     Do the one cylinder thing if you are really short on money. The cost
     of a stock rebuild kit with new pistons, cylinders, reground
     cam/crank/lifters and bearings is pretty cheap--as low as $250
     exchange! Add a few bucks to check out your heads, and with careful
     cleaning and assembly, you will have aengine you can depend on for a
     while.

     Well, I shouln't preach though. Back when I was in high school and
     college, I was a master of the mix&amp;match game. I would pick up blown
     VW engines and scavenge the &quot;good&quot; parts out of them. I would then
     happily assemble engines (from these used parts) that would run to
     keep my bug alive. After all, Muir said it could be done, didn't he?
     Well, it can. However, none of those engines mage it past 15-20,000
     miles before self-destructing. I learned quite a bit about engines
     those years! Also, my parents got used to the late-night calls begging
     &quot;I'm on the Interstate, about 30 miles from you guys. Can you drive
     out here and pick me up in the station wagon? Oh yeah, and bring the
     tow-bar.&quot; My Dad eventually got sick of this and gave me a folding
     tow-bar on my birthday that I could keep in my Bug in the area where
     the back seat should have resided. Then I could pester anybody with a
     hitch, and not just him...

     Oops, got a little long winded there!
