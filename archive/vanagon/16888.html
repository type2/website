Subject: Re: Best Vanaogon Brake Pads?

&gt;
&gt;Well the pads started squeeking a little the other day, so I am thinking
&gt;maybe I will change the pads this time, especially if you guys can tell me a
&gt;good brand/type of pad to buy that wont garf up my wheels and will not
&gt;squeek excessively.

I haven't used them but Repco MetalMaster Dustless are thought to be good. 
If available for a van. I have heard of noise complaints about semi-metallic 
pads, but don't know if that is typical. The difference between cheapest and 
very best pads is small compared to the rest of the deal. I put one cheap 
set in my Vanagon, never ever again, they smoked, they wore out fast, they 
didn't slow the van down fast at all. Go for broke.   tim s.
