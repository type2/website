     OK, folks, busy times at work but here are the bare bones:

     Elizabeth Furnace Campground, on VA RT 675 north of Detrick and south
     of Route 55,where 55 runs between Strasburg and Front Royal. Near
     intersection of I81 and I66.

     Come Friday or Saturday, bring something for a potluck Saturday night.
     Camping sites may be limited Saturday, if necessary we can put two
     vehicles at each campsite.

     DC area folks, if you want to caravan Friday afteroon, call me at home
     (301) 270-8073


     Later!


     Tom F.
