&lt;&lt;  I'm going to install at least two VDO gauges in my project van (oil 
 press and tach, maybe oil temp) and am a bit perplexed about where to 
 install them. 
      The only place on the dash that seems suitable would be on top of 
 the present instrument cluster.  Unfortunately, wiring three gauges there 
 would make removing the cover a minor nightmare.
 
      Any suggestions? &gt;&gt;

center console that covers htr duct/coolant lines, forward of shifter.
inst cluster out of '81'-'83 audi 4000s or 4e fits right in there.
