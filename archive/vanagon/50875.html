&gt; I shut my driver's door on my 83 Westy today and the side window shattered

&gt; a regular Vanagon I could go to my junkyard and get one but it's one of those 
&gt; ones that slide and has the screen.  If someone has one to sell me, please let 
&gt; me know as I need it ASAP!

&gt; Hey, how hard is this to replace?  Anyone have instructions?

     Bryan,
        Try a local auto glass shop. They can cut glass to fit!
