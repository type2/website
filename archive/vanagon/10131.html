Do you think you could find a Subaru dealer who would work on the original
import (rear-engine, air-cooled, two-cylinder, two-stroke, pre-mix)?
Or a Honda dealer that will work on a 600 (front-engine, two-cylinder,
air-cooled)?  How about a Saab dealer that will work on one of their
two-strokes?  Product abandonment is common.

Would you take a Model A to a Ford dealer?

Sears will probably throw one of their drelgs at anything with wheels on
it... :-)

Of course, if they weren't still actually manufacturing the Beetle and
variations on the Bus in Mexico and Brazil (and others), our supply of
parts would have dried up completely too.  Something to NOT look forward
to...
