&gt;Hell, In the non catalytic, carburated engines, all you have to do is 
&gt;shut off the ignition while still moving and in gear...
&gt;This will fill up your exhaust with plenty of air/fuel...
&gt;
&gt;When it ignites it'l shoot a nice flame cone outta the pipe...
&gt;

I used to drive a large furniture moving truck as a summer job. It had a 
cracked manifold and was a bit noisy, BUT if you did as sstones suggests you 
got a 'backfire' loud enough to scare the hell out of people nearby.  Full 
throttle, followed by no throttle followed by a quick 'blip' to ignite the 
gases.  Used it to clear pedestrians, joggers and dogs away from the side of 
the road as I lurched along. It would've taken the muffler off my van, this 
was a cast iron manifold on a 12 ton International Harvester truck, age 
uncertain.
