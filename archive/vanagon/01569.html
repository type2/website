Subject: heater boxes, exhaust, etc.

 grr ... I recently removedd my 73 Camper's 1700cc engine, in an effort to 
replace the heads, and I''m discovering more and more problems ...
 The heater boxes, exhaust manifold and muffler are all badly rusted. There
is no way I can justify buying new boxes, but I really don't need heat
right now anyway. Does an adapter exist for the type IV engine that will let 
me remove the heater boxes altogether? If  anyone has suggestions as to
how I might get out of this in the most inexpensive way possible, please
respond! Thanks.
Dan
