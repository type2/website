&gt; us...isn't in the way for access or clearance and no problems from bumpy
&gt; road caused dents. I use those web belt/buckle tie-downs to cinch them

I have been thinking of a front mounted carrier myself, one of the
reasons is that I feel more like I can have some control over whether or
not I rear-end somebody than I have over being rear-ended.  I would hate
to have a couple of expensive mountain bikes ruined by some jerk bumping
my rear end, not to mention the damage to the rear hatch.  Does anyone
know where to get a good front mount carrier?

thanks,
