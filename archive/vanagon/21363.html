Subject: Intake Manifold Porting

I finally got my Weber Progressive carb kit.  I have a question about 
the intake manifold.  It has EMPI cast into it.  It has a couple of 
copper or orangish cooled pipes glued or welded into the ends to go 
out to the end castings.  When I looked down into the intake part 
nearest the carb I spyed a big hunk of left over material of a big 
drip of the stuff they used to glue the two side pipes into.  It is 
about the size of a very large coffee bean (organic mexican I think). 
What I am wondering is how badly I want that thing out of there.  I 
thinkI can reach it with a file.  Also, where they mated the two side 
tubes with some kind of brown glue, there is some that ran over into 
the path of the mixture coming from the carb.  Do I want that there?  
Can I take my file to this and fix it up?  Should I take it to a 
professional?  Is this typical or should I refuse it and ship it back?
I don't have anything beyond stock end castings and heads (extractor 
exhaust) so part of me thinks I might be worrying too much.  However, 
another part of me wants to make what I have the best that I can.  
Also, I have a couple of cans of that high-temp black stove paint for 
the exhaust and tin, what would it look like on this intake?  I have 
only seen into a very few VW engine compartments.  Thanks, Jim
