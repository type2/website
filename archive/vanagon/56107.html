&gt; The water pump in my '86 GL has got to go.  I've got a new pump on the way,
&gt; I've printed out the FAQ, got the Bentley warmed up, I *think* I'm ready.
&gt; 
&gt;  I plan to remove and replace the pump.  Since I've got the system open
&gt; anyway, I will drain, refill and bleed the cooling system.
&gt; 
&gt;  Am I missing anything?  Does anyone have any last words of advice before I
&gt; begin?

 	I Wish you all the luck in the world!!! I have just done that 
job while stranded in eastern north carolina
it took me 7.5 hours it take a lot patience one suggestion I have is to 
have two 6mm allen wrenches one keep in original size and the other, cut 
the short section in half so that it will allow you to reach in tight 
spots
 when replacing the new pump loosly fit the hose with the flat gasket 
first
GOOD LUCK OLD CHap!
