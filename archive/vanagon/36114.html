Subject: Posting Adventures or not

Variety is the spice of life. If anyone reads a post title that is not of
interest then delete it for gosh sakes! I highly support the listmembers who
write about their adventures. I personally, am impressed with the talent of
quite few of the regular authors.  As for me, I simply regurgitate my
thoughts as I think through them.  The percieved informality of the &quot;list&quot;
medium allows me to go beyond worrying about the dotted &quot;i&quot; and crossed &quot;t.&quot;
Hopefully my mumblings will assist others in avoiding my mistakes or
beneifit from my discoveries. No one should percieve VanBondo as a
knowledgable guru. Readers should run with an CYA, circumspect attitude.
(look it up). The thoughts, experiences, and adventures of the authors are
what I seek.
 
Secondly, I still have a problem understanding what the frackus over
&quot;Bandwidth&quot; is all about. The concept of conserving band width reminds me of
my grand mother who, according to my 75 year old mother, used pull the
electric plugs from the outlets to &quot;keep the electricity from escaping.&quot;
Apparently she didn't trust the on/off switch. Are we still counting each kb
or what? Step up from ELM, VI, use the ^D key or deal with it.
Life is Too Short,
