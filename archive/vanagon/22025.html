&gt; Made it to San Francisco from Ottawa in my previously unproven 73 Westy.  I
&gt; put 7000 miles on the bus in a month!  Longest day was from Kenora, Ontario

&gt; 
&gt; So - where's a good place to get parts in San Francisco?  Good Junkyard?

Don't know much about SF. Travelling a little down the penisula you've got 2 
really good parts shops:

   - Kohlweiss in Redwood City, (415) 367-8424
   - Donsco in Belmont, (415) 592-1131

A decent garage is:

   - Fred's Garage in Redwood City, (415) 368-5343

For parts, I like:

   - Pick-Your-Part in Hayward, just over the bridge in the east bay.

There's also a bunch of stuff in San Hoser, but that's a bit of a schlep for 
you.

Welcome to the lunacy!
