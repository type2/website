Subject: I found an '80 westy......$?


How much is reasonable to pay for an '80 westy....some rust-needs light 
body work &amp; a paint job, rebuilt engine, new tire &amp; brakes, 115k.
The owner has in the paper for $1800, but said on the phone he'd take 
$1600.....is this good???

any info you might have would be great

Thanks
BL&gt;
