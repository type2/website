Subject: correction re: my 'new' vanagon

Ok, it looks like I was in error when I said I just purchased an '87 
westy multivan.  It looks like a multivan with one seat missing, but I 
believe now that it is an '87 camper (base, not GL) which used to have a 
removable fridge behind the front passenger seat.  Also, like some of you 
suggested, the wolfsburg emblems were probably added by the first owner 
despite the fact that it has most of the wolfsburg edition features.

Now that I know what I have, I need a little help.  I have the camper 
manual for '87, but it seems to refer only to the GL model.  My westy has 
a second battery under the driver's seat, but I'd like to know more about 
it besides knowing that &quot;it helps the other battery&quot;. Does anyone have 
any literature or know of where I can get literature which explicitly 
describes the functioning of this particular configuration?  (For 
instance, what does this battery power and how long can it be used with 
the car's engine off).  Also, does 
anyone have any of the promotional brochures from 1987 which describe the 
features of this model?  Finally, if none of this is available, is there 
a wiring diagram somewhere which might help?

I've called a couple local VW dealerships and they were unable to help.  
If any of you know of and/or live near dealers that know about vanagons, 
perhaps you could refer me to them and/or ask about this for me?  
However, my guess is that if this list doesn't have the answer, then the 
dealers won't be of help either.  

Thanks for the help.
