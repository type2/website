Subject: Re: Interesting Eurovan Pickup

I defer to more authoritative Canadian sources, but based purely upon 
observation (never having been in the market for a truck), VW of Canada 
appears to have Eurovans in plain van, passenger van, pickup, crewcab, 
camper and possibly other styles.  You can also get diesels and 
(possibly) turbo diesels (no, not TDI).

In Toronto, there are lots of commercial EV vans running around.
