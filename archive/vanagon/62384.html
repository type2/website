Subject: fridge question

Hi, I'm new to the list so I hope this is the proper method of submitting a
question.  Anyway, I recently bought an '86 Westy. I appears to be in mint
condition but for some reason I cannot get the pilot light lit on the
refrigerator.  The lp tank is full, I get a spark (visible thru the peep
hole), the unit works fine using the battery and AC.  I have tried
numberous suggestions such as blowing air thru the drain pipe; various
pumping techniques; trying to start it with the unit pre-chilled; burning
off excess air from the stove; etc. None of them worked. I've gotten
frustrated enough to pay someone to fix it for me.  So any suggestions?  I
live in Berkeley so if anyone can recommend someone in the immediate area
who might be able to help, it would be greatly apppreciated.

Thanks, Martin Jara
