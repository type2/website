Some years ago, my Auntie's daughter (my cousin, I guess) went on
holiday to Turkey in a VW camper. This was in the early seventies
when Turkey was, at least in the eyes of the British public, still 
exotic if somewhat underdeveloped.

Despite being trendy and flower-loving types, they sensibly took 
with them a large quantity of clean (ha!) British tapwater, and 
that most useful of devices, a portable toilet.

Now, this toilet was basic: strictly functional and utilitarian. 
It comprised a plastic seat atop an aluminium frame, and that's it. 
To use it you simply attached a plastic bag under the seat, filled 
the bag and then sealed it and disposed of it as you saw fit. Easy.

However, because Cousin *was* a member of the British public, 
she was quite ignorant of exactly how hot it was going to be 
trundling around Turkey in a metal box, and of just how much 
water they were going to be drinking.

So, inevitably, the water quickly ran out, and they found 
themselves in a place far from what they considered to be 
civilisation replenishing their supplies from a dubious standpipe 
outside a building that you could squint at and generously describe 
as a fleapit.

Equally inevitably, it was not too many hours before the &quot;water&quot; 
began to have an effect and the diarrhoea started to flow. As 
they wound their way ever higher into the hills they made ever 
more frequent stops. The constant stopping and starting and ensuing
evacuations of the van by all but one of our travellers, who had his 
own evacuation to consider in any case, soon exhausted them all and 
they finally decided to stop for the night. There were six of them in
the van and, or so I was told and I have no reason to disbelieve it,
the smell was appalling.
 
They pulled off the road into some woods and set up camp. Since they
had heard stories of hill bandits and other nasty people who lived
in these places, they decided it would be safer if they all slept
in the van; but to make room for them all, they had to move a load
of stuff out and put it under the camper. 

This they did, and soon they were all tucked up in bed, safe in the
knowledge that the table and chairs and a myriad other camping
essentials, as well as the dozen or so bags of diarrhoea that our
environmentally conscientious hippy friends had been carrying around
all day in the hope of finding somewhere to dispose of them, were all
safely under the van.

One of them awoke in the night and thought he heard voices. He put
this down to imagination and went back to sleep.

Morning broke, golden and fine over the mountains. They climbed out
of the van feeling refreshed and mercifully free of stomach cramps.
But their happiness was shortlived, for they found that they had been
robbed. Everything had been pinched from under the van: table, chairs,
parasol, the lot. Including the abovementioned dozen or so bags of shit.

But there was more to come. Closer examination of the site revealed 
a pair of badly soiled combat trousers and a pair of socks. Nearby lay
one of the bags, split wide open and empty save for a cloying film 
grey-brown fluid.

Everything else was gone.

To me, this story is amusing and slightly tasteless; but more important,
it is thought provoking.

For whoever stole the bags was aware of their contents, to the extent
that one bag had split and forced someone to divest himself of socks and
trousers.

One question has kept me awake often over the years and will undoubtedly
haunt me to my grave: why take the rest?

Jon
