Subject: Re: new vw/winnebago campers

Since Joel brought it up-

About three months ago I received a letter from vw America
listing the dealers who would be part of the test market
of distribution.  One is a few miles from my home and is
located right next to the freeway.  I've been meaning to drop
in to check them out.  So far I've only glanced at them (very
few on the lot) as I drive by.  If anyone wants to know if
a dealer in your area is part of the pre-marketing stuff, I'll
try to find the list.  I think I kept it?

&gt; oh, yeah. :) i forgot the punch line:
&gt;
&gt; the whole point is that
&gt; (1) half-size town has winnebago dealer.
&gt;     full-size armpit has none.
&gt; (2) half-size dealer has three.
&gt;     full-size armpit vw dealer can't even spell 'camper'.
&gt;     hell, full-size armpit vw dealer has only six vw's on the whole lot!
