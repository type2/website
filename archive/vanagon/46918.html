Check around, local import guy by me used to sell Pentosin CF-11 and
CF-7.1 for about $14 and $12 the liter respectively,  recently realizing
he was really underselling he raised to $18 and $15 the liter but still
incredible compared to VW.

Still all Vanagons are supposed to use ATF in my knowlege, certainly
until '89 or so, I'm not sure if they switched the van to Pentosin when
they switched most FWD cars '88-'90, but I know for sure my '85,
the parents old '86, and a friends '88 came with ATF.  If you have ATF
I would not likely change to the hydraulic oil, could be a real costly
mistake.
