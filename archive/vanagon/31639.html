Subject: 85 VW Westfalia Camper
Date: 27 Dec 1995 00:42:13 GMT

This is a great car.  Runs excellent.  Refrigerator, Gas Stove, Sink,
storage, cassette/radio, AC (works great).  Sleeps 4 easy.  (You've got to
see it, to believe it, but I've had two couples camping many times.)

One year ago Lemon Busters said this car was a great buy!  My divorce is
your late Christmas present.  I've driven this car all over Texas and have
had a blast in it.  If you've ever looked for Westfalias, you know how
hard good ones are to find, and how reluctant the owners are to selling
them.  I don't want to sell it either, but...

Tan body, White Top.  105K  (Motor already rebuilt and runs strong!)
$7,500 firm.

Call 477-2279 hm, or 502-4505 wk (but I'm off until Jan. 2)
