&gt;I have these idiots once in a while, but more often, I have their distant
&gt;cousins.  The ones that are putzing along and I gain on them and the minute
&gt;they realize that they're being over-taken by a VW, they speed up!?!  Now

i call that kind &quot;dumbasses&quot;. :) or &quot;sleepers&quot;. they are off in another
world until you catch up to them. then they wake up.

&gt;why the hell do they gotta do that?  They were going their original speed
&gt;for a long time for me to catch up in the first place and then &quot;all-of-
&gt;a-sudden&quot; they can't stand it that they were being passed by a VW.
&gt;Sheesh!  And then after they speed up and are ahead of you for a while,
&gt;they gradually slow down to their original speed until they realize that
&gt;a VW is passing them again.  What kind of anal retentives do this kind
&gt;of driving?!

the dangerous kind. this is just one of the eight million stories on the
Naked Highway. and YOU have to watch out for ALL of them!!! :)
