So ACommons_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; OK, I'm new to my van, and have been reading the owners manual.  There's this
&gt; little round knob down by my right knee, next to the heater controls with the
&gt; word Temp on it, and some arrows.  I've found it in the manual, under the
&gt; heading VW Auxiliary Heater, but for the life of me, I can understand what
&gt; this thing is supposed to do.  I turned it on following the directions, but
&gt; don't know if it did anything.  Please, someone tell me what this knob really
&gt; does!  
&gt; 

Well, it's suppose to turn on the heater that is built in under there rear
bench seat.  You have a Westy or a bus?  It's just a heater core with a
blower built in it.  When you turn on the switch (3 speeds) it activates
the blower.  From what you've said, it sounds like the blower isn't
blowing.  I'd check the fuse first and then the switch.  I've had trouble
with the switch for the main heater and had to replace it.  Kinda of a
cheapo switch.  If that doesn't do it, you'll have to check other things
like the connections, the relay at the blower end.

Hope this helps,

Steven
