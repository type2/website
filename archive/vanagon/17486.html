&gt; Volks,

&gt; which has the registration sticker.  Any help appreciated!

My brother and I just drove into Canada without a front plate on
wednesday. We're two young guys and we had a lot of stuff piled
in the back (including a vespa) and got no hassle.

I wonder what happenned to my front plate though...
