&gt; I've got JCWhitney's $70 fan in the main heat duct on my 81 Vanagon.  It helps
&gt; a lot, although it is very noisy.  If I could do it again I would consider
&gt; mounting it in the engine compartment.  This type of fan, together with 
&gt; scrupulous care to make sure your heating system is tight from end to end (e.g.
&gt; high temp red silicone sealing the heat exchanger case to the pipes), will do
&gt; a lot.  Enough for C-c-c-canada? 

&gt;&gt;&gt;last year, so I am told, Ottawa had two 
weeks of sustained -30 C weather so I don't know. if the blower is 
sufficient - I am thinking of installing an electric heater in line with 
the main duct so that it pulls in pre-warmed heat and throws out extra 
heat when needed -this would necessitate adding an additional in line 
duct-   &gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Make me an offer if you want my VW gas heater.  I don't use it enough to
&gt;justify having it under there losing value. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know what these are 
worth ... so please let me know. How good is it on gas? &gt;&gt;&gt; 

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;BTW the guy in Menlo Park, CA who did the checkup on the van after I 
installed the engine disconnected the flaps 
from the thermostat saying it wasn't crucial in CA. Do you use it in 
NY?

&gt;&gt;&gt; My key concern is not repeating my experience with my Karmann Ghia - 
scraping ice off the INSIDE of the windshield while driving down the 
highway in December....

Thanks in advance - DC &gt;
