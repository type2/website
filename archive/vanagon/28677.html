Subject: re:Inuvik alternative

John Anderson bemoaned the fact that most of us in the southwest, and
east of the Mississippi most likely will not be able to make it to
Inuvik :-(

How about we arrange a trip to the Smoky Mountains, or somewhere along
the southern portion of the Appalacian trail.  That should be close
enough for us east of the continental divide to make in about 2 days
drive. That way those of us south of the Mason-Dixon line could attend.

Just a thought.

Cheers,

David
