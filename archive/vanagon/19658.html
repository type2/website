Subject: Checked out the '90 Vanagon GL

I'm the one who was asking for advice regarding a '90 Vanagon GL for $7995.
I went to see it today.  The body is &quot;pretty darn straight&quot; (you have to
look in the right light to see a few light dings.  Nothing breaks the paint
or is very deep).  The interior is nice, with seats for 7 people.  I took my
2 and 4 year old kids and we checked it out.  I had a few minutes before the
salesman came out.  It does have good tires, and nice alloy wheels.  There
is a piece of rubber trim above the slider door that is pulling out, and
there are some seat belt pieces missing from the center two seats.  It does
have AC, but I didn't try it out.  It has 95,000 miles on it.  I looked
under the car and found a motor with just enough dirt on it to see that it
hadn't been cleaned recently.  The motor was dry, and there was none of the
white corrosion looking crap on the cylinder heads that I had been warned to
look for.  The coolant is blue.  It has a pull out stereo.  The guy came out
and took us for a ride.  My kids loved it (it is a &quot;bus&quot; after all).  It
started quickly with no smoke.  It did seem to run on three cylinders for a
moment.  It is very quiet inside when driving down the road.  It seemed
about as fast as our '79 westy bus when healthy.  It didn't shimmy, rattle,
squeal or knock during the drive.
I told him that I would get my wife and have her come check it out, without
trying to seem excited.  I'm going to try and dump my '75 Rabbit for a trade
(it's been fun darlin', but you just ain't as pretty as you was).
What do you think folks?
