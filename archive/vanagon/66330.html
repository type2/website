 with the VC--it's probably related to the front diff or CV joints.  &gt;&gt;

Mark is right on the first question, but wrong on the later suggestion.

My Syncro does this as well while making U turns.  The proper operation of
the VC is to lock up when the speed of the rear wheels differs from the speed
of the front wheels.  This is EXACTLY what happens in a turn.  The front
wheels travel a longer distance, at a faster speed, than the rear wheels and
this makes the VC lock up.  The tighter the turn the greater the differnce
between the front and rear wheel speeds.

I would be concerned if my Syncro did NOT exhibit this characteristic.  This
would mean that the VC was not locking up.

The original post seemed to idicate that the binding was severe.  Severe
binding could mean that the VC is locking up too easily.  Has this been
getting worse over time? Or is this Syncro relatively new to you?  Perhaps
what you seem to think is severe is just normal?  Hard to tell from this side
of my computer. :-)
