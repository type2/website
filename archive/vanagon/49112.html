Subject: Re: 86 Westy Electrical Questions/Problems

After a little bit of a&quot; calming down break&quot;, I was able to think a little
bit more rational. I pulled out my  multi-meter and started to do a little
point to point probing. Low and behold I found no continuity across the LRR.
It seems to have a resistor wired into the coil side of the relay, I guess
it decides by the voltage draw when to open or close . I went to the local
import shop and snagged a replacement for about $7.00. Pluged it in and
presto all better. So many thanks to all who responded.

&gt;The problem could very well be in the load reduction relay. It's purpose it
&gt;to reduce electrical load while cranking. The items you listed are probably
&gt;controlled by the load reduction relay. What you have to determine is, did
&gt;the relay quit working? Did the power input into the relay cut out? (This is
&gt;somewhat less likely) Did the power that switches the relay cut out? Or did
&gt;the relay loose it's ground? The LRR used to be in the fuse box. It's pretty
&gt;much square. If I remember correctly the terminals are not centered in the
&gt;bottom, (this may not be entirely true, it's been many years since I worked
&gt;on them) If you cannot duplicate the problem you may want to carry a heavy
&gt;gauge jumper wire with you #10 gauge with a female connector on each end. If
&gt;the symptoms return. Remove the LRR and use the jumper to jump across the
&gt;terminals that 30 and 87 plug in. Note that the 30 and 87 are on the relay
&gt;NOT on the fuse box. Just line up the relay and put the jumper in the
&gt;corresponding female slots. This will not diagnose the problem though. You
&gt;will need a test light or volt meter to determine if the relay's controlling
&gt;voltage is the problem. The two remaining  terminals are the control
&gt;connections. One is 12 volts and the other is ground. Good Luck

&gt;&gt;While driving thru the brunt of hurricane Eddie, we lost our front and rear
&gt;&gt;windshield wipers, heater blower motor,aux. heater, rear defroster, and last
&gt;&gt;but not least the A.C.. We checked all the fuses and relays we could find
&gt;&gt;and they all seemed to be AOK. There didn't seemed to be any water or
&gt;&gt;moisture anywhere near the fuse panel , which is always a concern . After
&gt;&gt;consulting with Bentley, we realized that our relay panel seems to be
&gt;&gt;missing some of the relays shown in the book. Though at this time thats a
&gt;&gt;B-list problem {everything was working before we noticed the difference.}
&gt;&gt;  So here are a couple of questions I hope you guys can help me out with,
&gt;&gt;    1. Are there any other fuses or relays I need to be searching for?
&gt;&gt;    2. What does the load reduction relay do ?
&gt;&gt;    3. Bentley shows a 2nd. stage rad. cooling fan relay , I can't find it
&gt;&gt;on the panel, what is the purpose of it and where else may it be located ?
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;                Thanks alot in advance.
