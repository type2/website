Subject: Re: Auto Trans Maintenance?

&gt; I look carefully at the pan gasket, if it's still pliable and not 
&gt; cracked, I reuse it.  VW charges a lot for them, they don't need any 
&gt; donations unnecessarily.  If you start seeing red puddles under your 

Autozone or Advanced, $15 the whole kit including the pan gasket, 
paper filter gasket and filter, Taiwanese origion yes, but identical 
to the OEM so who cares.  Worth the ease of installation, lets you 
afford to change it every 30k or whatever you like.
