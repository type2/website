&gt; I have acquired a 1984 GL with two different keys which is slightly

&gt;  Is it simple or inexpensive change some or all of the barrels so that one
&gt;  key will fit ignition/cab doors/sliding door/rear hatch?

Lionel,
I have changed the rear hatch lock to match the rest of my van.  I bought a
used rear hatch lock so that I could install power door locks on it.  Since
this lock was different from the rest of my van's locks, I disassembled the
old lock and the &quot;new&quot; one and exchanged all of the little plates (I'll call
them &quot;cams&quot;) that slide up &amp; down depending on the key's ridges.  This was
not difficult - really fairly straighforward.  I did however have all of the
cams I needed from the old lock.  I don't know if VW sells these
individually, or if a locksmith might be able to supply them.

You mention changing the &quot;barrels&quot;.  I take it that you're talking about the
cylindrical assembly that holds the cams?  I think if you could get a
matching set of these, they would be fairly easy to install.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
