Subject: Splittie Bus Windshield Drain Holes

Howdy Listernauts!

I thought I'd pass on some info.  Our KC Kombis NEATO Chapter had a tech 
session yesterday on the installation of windshield rubber.  The 
candidate for this project had new rubbers installed a few yrs back, but 
they were not working out real well--ill fitting and leaking *with* an added 
black silicone bandaid fix.  To make a long story short here were the 
solutions:

 * New Rubber from Vintage Parts, Inc.
 * The use of an original style 'thin' replacement glass instead of the 
     thicker custom made US spec safety glass
 * Redrilling or augering out the original drain holes in the base of the 
     window sill
 * Sanding out the surface rust and lightly treating the area with 
     Rustmort or POR 50 (or whatever)

There was some debate over the advantages of removing the old rubber from 
the inside or outside.  Of course my preference for the inside method is 
the correct one IMHO (just kidding Dan!).  8-)

All this made for a happier 67 Deluxe Bus owner.  Esp. when we did not 
break any glass in the process (it is still Winter here in the midwest!).
