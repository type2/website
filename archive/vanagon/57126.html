Subject: Busses on the Blue Ridge Website

Howdy all. I just noticed that the Busses on the Blue Ridge website has been
updated for this year's event. Check it out at:
http://www.teleplex_dot_net/cwebb/buses.html
Should be lots of fun, just as it was last year. Also, from there, don't forget
the NC BuRPOBaT for a week of bussing along the Outer banks. For more info on
that, check out the TYPE2 page
http://www.type2_dot_com/
and look under the transporter tours section...
