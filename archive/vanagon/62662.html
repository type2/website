Subject: Gearbox conversion

Hi everyone!I=B4m new to this list.Today,actually.I have a little problem
I hope some of you
can help me with.I have a IRS gearbox from an aircooled Transporter that
was &quot;born&quot;
arond 1980.I want to use this together with the engine in an  old bug I
have.To do this I
understan that the gearbox needs to be rebuilt.I see in my Gene Berg
catalog that they
sell conversion-kits,but I wonder if any of you guys know of any cheaper
and easyer(?)
way to do this,maybe using bug or van parts?Hope to hear from you!

Have a nice summer!

Jan I.
