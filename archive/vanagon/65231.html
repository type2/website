&gt;As far as i know the only mexican made bugs were hardtops, and the last
&gt;bug conv. was made by Karmann in Germany in early '80....
&gt;
&gt;maybe someone made the bug into a conv. with a top frame off a junked
&gt;'70's bug conv??
&gt;highly  possible..with a welder, you can do anything...  :&lt;)
&gt;
&gt;anybody else know??

Don't know about this one, but I do know that a former roommate hacked the
top off a hardtop bug and made a convertible.  He really did a great job
and sold it as a genuine convertible.  He claimed the only difference was
his version occasionally sagged in the middle.
