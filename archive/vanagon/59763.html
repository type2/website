Subject: scary cruise control

Hello all,
I just installed an &quot;Equus&quot; brand cruise control in my '87 syncro
camper. The problem is this- when the clutch is pushed in the cruise
control is supposed to detect a rapid increase in RPM's and dump the
vacuum, thus releasing the throttle and not throwing the valves into the
pistons. At least this is what the manual claims. In reality, it works
for about 2 seconds (releases) then revs about 2000 rpm, until I tap the
brake or switch the demon off. 
	I don't want to order their &quot;optional, but not necessary&quot; clutch 'kill'
switch, so I throw the question out to you. Are there feasible options
or do I have to tape a big sign up on the dash that says DO NOT PUSH
CLUTCH WHEN IN CRUISE CONTROL MODE!!! especially when someone else is
driving?
As always, I appreciate the wisdom of the collective,
Jay
PS. The install is on the negative of the coil (tach. reading)
