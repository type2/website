Subject: throttle bodies - older motor with 85 tb?? 

I recently replaced the engine in my 85 van (1.9l) with an older 1.9 from a
scrapyard.  I have almost everything hooked back up, and the engine will
start.

The first question I have is about the throttle body.  On mine there is ONE
switch for idle and wide open.  The engine now, has two switches, one for
each. Can these switches hook up to the same wire as mine?

Do I hook them up in paralell, so that when either one is closed, it closes
the circuit?

I was just going to exchange the throttle bodies, but there are two vacuum
hoses that hook up to it on the motor now, but my other throttle body has
only place for one. . .

If you followed this so far without getting confused, help would be
appreciated, thanks already.
