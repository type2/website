I would use those tires on all four corners. Larger tires on the rear will
change the caster angle of the front wheels.  Can make handling scary.  Been
there, done that.  I have the Wrangle Aquatreads on my Syncro.  Excellent all
around tire.  Dunlop Rover GTX is also HR speed rated.  Should provide crisp
handling.
