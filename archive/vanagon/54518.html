Subject: Tiny orange switch right of steering column below dash?

Does anyone know what this thing does? It is on a relay kind of thing with
stickers that say on and off with red and green colors. My van stalled at a
light and I couldn't get it started until I tripped the switch. It acted
just like the G.F.I outlet in the bathroom.
