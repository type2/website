uhhhhhhhhh ... like, what's the question? :)

if you keep the little tank in the back filled up with the Blue Magoo, then
you're not letting any air get into the system, so the heater still works.
?  sounds ok? :)  you might not have the head gaskets leaking (i.e., the
combustion gases are NOT getting into the coolant), but instead have a leaky
head bolt or something else letting the coolant out.

are you SURE the leak is from the head(s)?? and not from the water pump or
maybe a hose connection or something else?
