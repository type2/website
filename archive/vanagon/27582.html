Subject: Re: barn doors?

sliding side doors were standard equipment on 68 and later busses.   They
were an option earlier than that,  actually in 1963.   I've seen two 64
sliding door, sliding sunroof standard microbuses in green and white  ( my
favorite bus colour combo).  I have also seen a wienee wagon with the sliding
door on the drivers side.   All three were European sold and had locking
steering columns.  I've seen a picture of a 21-window with sliding doors on
BOTH sides.



Why do I know all this trivia?
