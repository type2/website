Subject: Free  Splittie - maybe NOT

Well, in the last chapter  in the saga of the free 1964 
(make a note of that year) splittie, the PA area listmember gets the OK 
to haul it away from one family member, while the DC listmember gets the 
OK from another. 

They both pursue their plans, posting to the list. Then the family 
members talk to each other  and discover there is a little competition 
for the &quot;worthless vehicle&quot;. (Good thing the aren't on the Web, or seen 
my e-mail inbox!)

This AM, I got a call from the executor, saying that since more than one 
person was interested in  the splittie it might have some actual value, 
and as such she could not release it. She was going to post a 
&quot;do not remove&quot; sign on it, while she tries to evaluate what its worth. 

Meanwhile, the PA contigent may be driving down to DC today, perhaps 
pulling it out of the pile of leaves as we speak. Will he succeed?

Stay tuned. You can be pretty sure its not going the the crusher, 
anyway, and that is the real objective, IMHO. For an early update, 
attend the Eastern PA camping trip this weekend at French Creek State 
Park, organized by Dave Mancuso. See you there!
