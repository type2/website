&gt; &gt; Isn't there going to be propane in the lines whether the fridge is
&gt; &gt; running on propane or 12V?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, yes, but if you leave the valve open and are running propane,
&gt; you end up with a nice fuse line to ignite the entire tank.  At
&gt; least, that is my impression.


boys, boys, boys.  hold on.

propane needs an air/propane mix to ignite.  it will NOT travel up in 
a line and ignite the tank.  needs air.  lots of it.  someone can 
post the stoichiometric ratio but a 100% propane environment cannot 
support combustion.

also.  the quantity of propane stored in the lines with the main 
valve off is negligible.  if the line is ruptured, it will fart out a 
small quantity but causes no explosion hazard.

just had to step in...  i'll leave now.
