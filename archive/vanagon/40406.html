Subject: MORE 'you MAY be a devoted VW bus owner if:'

And a few more:

-you replaced your doorbell with a 6V VW horn
-you play the heat exchanger in the local brass band
-you installed 16&quot; VW wheels and a camber compensator on your mother-in-laws'
 wheelchair
-you have a room for rebuilding VW engines in your appartment on the third
 floor (like me)
-you have lifetime subscriptions to 7 different VW rags worldwide
