&gt;  I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do

&gt;  easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
&gt;  go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back 
&gt;  and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
&gt;  it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?

It's not *that* hard to just take the engine out.  I did it by removing
the fan housing from the engine, which is not hard to do.  I haven't tried
to take them out together, cause I think it would be too difficult to
do by myself.
