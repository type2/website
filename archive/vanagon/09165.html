&gt; is also right on:  that's where my leak is -- a pinhole in a field of rust
&gt; about 6 in. in diameter.
&gt; I took Jack's recommendation to run the car low on gas perhaps too seriously.
&gt; The car had less than a quart of gas in it when I drained the tank.  Now I
&gt; have to track down a used tank, or see if some brave soul welds gas tanks.

I have had success in repairing problems like this using a MAPP gas torch
from Sears. I had an oil-pan rust out on me in another car, and I removed
it, cleaned it up, and used the torch to braze the holes. The MAPP gas torch
kit comes with brazing rods and was under $40.00. Standard cautions
apply about gas fume explosions. 

For My diesel, when I dropped the tank, I noticed that professional repair
work had been done once. I was cheap and it had only one hole, so I bought
gas-tank epoxy and filled the hole, then spread the remainder of the epoxy
all around the rust areas (thinking that a new hole would pop up soon).

Then I sprayed the top with Undercoating, and installed it again. 6 months
and no problems, but I know I will have to call the Parts Place Inc. 
(810)373-2300 for a new or refurb tank someday, but I bought some time.
