Subject:      Re: Vanagon- Chev 2.8 V6 swap

   I do not recommend the chevy 2.8 v6. It has a balance problem
   that required the flywheel to match the crank shaft, dependeing
   on the year of the engine. in your installation the fylwheel will
   be the first thing to go!

&gt; I'm thinking of possibly swapping a chev 2.8 V6 for my 2liter VW engine (
&gt; it broke a piston and rod). I have the chev engine allready from a wreck
&gt; belonging to my brother. I've heard of Ford(2600) engines being swapped in
&gt; with few problems. My brother is a machinist and does not think an adapter
&gt; plate to mate engine and trans together will be a big deal. I'm concerned
&gt; about  cooling and the strength of the auto trans axle.Any help or
&gt; experience you may have on something  like this would be appreicated.
&gt;   My choice  of Chev V6 is its availability,it's compactness, and
&gt; relatively high horsepower(Approx 135 in X11trim).
&gt; Once again any help or advice would be welcomed.
