Subject:       RE: halogen backup lights

&gt; Does anyone run halogen bulbs in the reverse lights?  Will the sockets neet to 
&gt; be 
&gt; changed out as well?  Where can the bulbs (and sockets if necessary) be had?

There's only one thing to say:

Backup lights?  I don't need to steenkin' backup lights!  :-P &lt;grin&gt;
