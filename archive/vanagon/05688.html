This is almost a VW question...

	My parents bought an old house, and in the process of doing some 
renovations, my dad found a matching set of 1939 World's Fair license
plates!  He also found a '34 plate.  These were being used to cover
holes that the birds had made!  One plate is in very good shape, the second
is bent a little.

	My question is, how much are these worth?  I've looked for plates for
my '56, and they want about $100 or so.

	Wouldn't be cool to have these on a '39 bug?  (I believe the 1st year
was '38...)  Hell, woudln't it be cool to have a '39 bug period!

	Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Thom
