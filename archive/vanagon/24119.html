Well thanks to all who have replied.  The support helped.  Well the police 
finally decided that the hand prints on the bus could not be lifted because the
van itself was too dusty.  I've left the prints alone for now to remind me what
the idiots did.   I've got 2 nice sets of hand prints on the back of my van
where they pushed it at.  I am presentley now whating to find the time to take 
the stearing wheel off to see if there is some way to disconnect the locking 
device to the igniton and I have found a donor for the parts.  Hopefully in the
next week I will be driving a bus again, Instead of my roommate's Neon.  I was 
born to drive a VW not these plush interior, ac, automobiles.
Brad
