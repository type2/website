&gt;Hi all, the rockers on my '87 Syncro GL are covered in what looks like
&gt;leftover adhesive goop. Any ideas what was there before? Ground effects
&gt;skirt? Hah. The goop is on both sides, full length between wheels. Cleaning
&gt;it off for repainting is going to be a chore. My '85 was cleanly painted
&gt;down there, no chipguard, nothing but smooth paint, so I'm puzzled. No
&gt;ground effects airdam up front on the '87, regular square tin bumpers. Any
&gt;takers? TIA, tim s.

that stuff is called Body Shutz, and is a sort of pliable thick paint ...
it's supposed to prevent rocks and stuff from scratching the metal. other
cars also use it (porsche 911 has some way down at the bottom, and some
mercedes models also had it). it definitely is hell to get off ...
check with a local body shop/paint supplier to see what sort of remover
will take it off (as i recall, you have to use one of those super-toxic,
gotta-wear-gloves-and-a-face-fask removers ... like the ones used for
removing paint from airplanes. you do NOT want to get careless with that
kind of remover!!! it also removes SKIN!!!)

better yet, just clean it really well and leave it on. cheaper. quicker.
