Subject: VW powered &quot;Bugatti&quot;

	Hmm, I saw something that looked like a Bugatti body with
what were obviously VW Beetle front axle ends hanging out of it on
Bascomb Avenue the other day- looked like fun, but I figured it
was just one guy's folly. Hmmm, maybe there's more of 'em!

	Cheers!
	Bill
