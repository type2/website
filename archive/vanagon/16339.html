Subject: VW 40th Ann. video

this video was like a show on the discovery channel, but there were only VW 
commercials between segments, it gave the history of vw and talked alot 
about the beetle, it talked about how vw lost it to japanese cars, and now 
how they are coming back now.  the last part was about the concept 1, which 
should be here soon.

some important things about the video:

1. there were NO bussess/vanagons/evans at all.
2. the word &quot;Hitler&quot; was not in the video, german government was preferred.

included was a pamphlet about current products, nice paint jobs, and there 
was no EVans... strange...

i'd love to see an old vanagon ad... sigh..
