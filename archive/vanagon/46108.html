Head Count -
Talk to some local mechanics before you decide on heads.  Recently 
used a set that shortly after installation (6 weeks) broke.  Actually 
a defective valve spring broke.  I was't the only one, just amongst 
the first.  I can't recall the maker but check with some local 
mechanics first.

&gt; After extensive calling to find the cheapest heads on the market, I need some
&gt; information on who carries stuff that is good as opposed to what stuff is &quot;bad&quot;
&gt; This is of course just your opinion but I would still appriciate what your 
&gt; experiance has been with the particular products listed below.
