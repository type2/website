&lt;&lt; I recall a while back there was some
 heated discussion on how to get the bad smells out of your rig,
 specifically the seats. &gt;&gt;
Chris, Ive found Naptha to work well(a dry cleaning agent)It is hard to find
but if you wipe down  the cloth w/ naptha w/ a white rag it will take out the
smell(essentially dry cleaning your fabric).It will smell like drycleaning
for a couple of days but should work.
