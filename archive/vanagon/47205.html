&gt;I wonder if anyone may be able to answer this one. I have seen two 
&gt;vanagon crew cabs here in southern california over a period of perhaps 8 
&gt;or 9 years. Unfortunately, both were traveling in the opposite 
&gt;direction. 
&gt;Where, how can I find out about obtaining one?

These were not originally sold in the USA.  The ones you saw were likely
originally sold in Canada and imported into the USA personally.  To buy one,
you could call Canadian VW dealers, check Canadian newspapers somehow,
perhaps ask out Canadian listmembers to keep an eye out for one for sale for
you.

Good Luck,
