Yes, Thom, they have a rear lid for your bus.(I think.)

But if you could talk them out of it, I would be surprised.

They do sell parts, though: I got the engine lid for my bus for

6.00! (minor dents, surface rust, but better than what I got.)

I'll talk to them, and see if I can post their phone # here for

the (sadly) few split owners we have here.
