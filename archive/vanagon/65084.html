&lt;&lt; I have a slate-grey 86 Syncro GL, and WHITE RUBBERS would look just
 terrible.
 a) Are there black ones available?
 b) What exactly are they made of?....plastic or rubber??
 c) How exactly do they attach?
 d) Where can we see a picture/ read a description of them?
 e) How long do they tend to last?
 d) Has anyone done business with Zeidler successfully before?? &gt;&gt;


they're prolly ABS plastic since they're white..???
PAINT THEM....

the black rubber 2 piece ones are available from European VW dealers for more
than what you prolly paid for your whole van...

Helmut Ziedler is just a helpful German listmember who is only doing this as
a courtesy to us US listmembers who like to have hard to find overpriced
goofy european accessories on our VW vans..  :&lt;)
.......so we can go to a VW meet and have everybody say &quot;kew-el lips ,
dude...where'dya get em?? &quot;  heh..heh..not tellin'....  :&lt;)

Anyway, as far as Helmut's honesty, there's no question there...
how many of you would organize a whole group purchase like this without
making a red cent??
