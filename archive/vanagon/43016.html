Subject: Re: Need TIPS restoring on Westfalia '66

&gt;  Should I use
&gt;the sandpaper and varnish on it? What kind of varnish would be apporiate?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thank you,

I would recommend scuffing the surface with 220/280 grit, and finishing
with a semi-gloss polyurathane. Varnish IS a good finish, but unless you
have experience it has several problems: it is prone to 'fish-eyes,' it
takes 8-10 ours to dry (more time for bugs, dust, pets, kids, to mess it
up), and is not very scratch resistant. Poly is idiot proof. Dries in three
hours, is VERY mar resistant, and is self leveling. I used this on the Ash
floor of my bus and it has held up pretty well, given the sharp nails of my
dog, rocks in my shoes, etc.
