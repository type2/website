Yo

	Wellm I think I fixed the brake problem.  I ran a quart of CLR thru the 
brake lines, interspersed with 3 quarts of clean brake fluid, and I think I got
all the little chunks of crap out.  I re-adjusted the rod and now the
brakes work good, they don't drag, and the brake light works as  it
should (Steve, you listening?)

	Now on to finishing the wheels, interior, electrical and undercarriage!
