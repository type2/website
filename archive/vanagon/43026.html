Subject:  86 Westy Syncro , Re: Dynamic oil pressure 

I'm still trying to track down a problem with my oil warning system. The high
and low pressure switches have been replaced along with the circuit board. At
about 3000 RPM the light flashes and the buzzer goes on. If I rev above 3000
, they stop. It was suggested to me to use the V.W. filter, it helped for a
while though it started again this weekend. Does anyone know if there is
another relay or cap. in this circuit . It gets to be pretty annoying after a
4 or 5 hour drive. I actually cut the connection on the old board so we
didn't have to listen to the buzzer on the way home from Maine.
