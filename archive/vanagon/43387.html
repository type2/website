Subject: cheap new buses in Jamaica

I heard of this guy who bought 1995 panel van (aircooled) brand spanking new
in Jamaica for $6,000.  sounded like the brasilia bus, with the breadloaf
windscreen, hinged cargo doors on the side, and a 1600 motor.      he lives
in Georgia and goes to Jamaica on vaction, and keeps the bus there.

what a deal!
