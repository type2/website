Subject:      Syncro exhaust split.

Hi all: The #1 exhaust pipe on my syncro just split. Made it 180,000
miles before it did though. I was wondering if anyone has experience
changing that pipe in a syncro with the engine in. Is is pretty straight
forward or do you have to drop a lot of stuff out of the way to do it.
Thanks
