Subject: Re: R&amp;T Digression, airbags

I don't think it was just a matter of the &quot;old-fartiness&quot; of Vanagon
drivers.

Aside from the studies done by the insurance companies, in the mid-eighties
the federales started doing head-on crash tests at speeds well above the
bumper standards of the time, and they came up with 3-and-4-digit damage
numbers, with gruesome interpretations about the probable extent of injuries
and fatalities.

For some reason, Vanagons fared very well on these tests, not just compared
with other vans, but with ALL vehicles.

So the nature of the driver was not a part of this - it was either very
brilliant safety engineering by Volkswagen, or maybe the wall the feds
chose to crash into was about 20&quot; high.

These tests might have been published in those infamous &quot;Car Books&quot; that
the Reagan administration tried to stifle - I'm gonna go dig through my
pile of EPA Gas Mileage Guides and see if I can find a &quot;Car Book&quot;.

On another literary topic - I finally spotted the 25th Anniversary Edition
of the Muir book at a local bookstore.

Bad part - they did NOT make an effort to integrate all the stray notes and
&quot;Changes to the 19xx Edition&quot; stuff - you are still led on wild-goose
often circular references with little payoff  (maybe this is a semi-adult
version of &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot;) and most of the newest changes have little to
do with Vanagons or earlier Type II's.

Good parts - they brought back the spiral binding (yay!) and there are
many pictures and bits of information on the beloved St. John.
Including his resume.  He WAS a rocket scientist!  (Somehow we kind of knew
that, right?)

So, there's no technical reason why you should run out and buy this if you
have a still-legible, fairly-recent previous edition.  AND, it does not
kill the market for the multi-media information-superhighway next-generation
dream of this group!
