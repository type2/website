Subject:      din numbers

i saw once upon a time a list of din numbers,
which referenced what the van was,
anyone that has the list,
please post it so i can get a copy.
i'm sure someone else on the list may be able to use this.

happy, happy, joy, joy,
i'm a wannabus who may have found one,
79 base with a rebuilt motor and 30k after
lousy paint job, anyone know the correct orange ?
the sliding door seams to close with difficulty, (difficult to fix?)
a lot of the window seals seam to have dry rot (resources/easy to
replace?)
and the air has been disconnected. (hope to re-install, $$$$$ ?)
i will need a bench seat which folds down to a bed, (any help?????)
Saturday i will turn over the motor, it has been idle for 4 monthes,
any suggested dos and don'ts,
remember i'm an uneducated wanna bus.

(oh yeah $600.00 is asking price)

so many questions, im so exited!!
sorry for this non-educating post if misplaced.
thanks ahead of time for any answers.
all smiles:)))))))))
