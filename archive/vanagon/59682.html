Subject: $3


      Sure, ok.  I'll be willing to throw $5 in the hat going 'round.
I'm usually quiet as to posting; I'm in digest mode, and usually get
things a bit later that way.

	I'm very sorry to see Gerry let it go, we've never met in person.
I would just like to shake his hand and thank him for what he has done.  
( consider a virtual hand-shake done) Real thank you here.

	Where shoud the check go?
