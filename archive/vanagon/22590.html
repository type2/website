             Part IV: Cruising up the Gulf of Mexico


In this chapter, Tobin and Christa bail out of the Oaxaca in the 
mountains of southern Mexico after a neighbouring RV gets 
firebombed, and head for the Republic of Texas.

February 11, 1995

The firebombing at the RV park two nights before had made us think 
that maybe it was time to be moving on.  Speculation was that the 
incident was related to President Ernesto Zedillo's announcement 
that the government had identified a key leader of the Chiapas 
Zapatista rebels, and that the army was working hard to locate and 
arrest him.  The area around Oaxaca is reported to have a lot of 
Zapatista supporters and sympathizers, and there were a number of 
reports of political violence in the area since Zedillo's 
announcement.  We decided it was time to move on with our trip and 
head back to the States.

I had put off doing the oil change on the camper until the morning 
we pulled out.  Finding 20/50 oil (actually, _any_ multiweight 
oil) proved difficult, and I finally had to pay out of the nose, 
but got brand-name oil (Valvoline) in return.  I should have 
picked up six or seven quarts of Castrol when I was at the market 
the day before, but at the time the prices seemed really high.  So 
I waited and ended up paying even more!  :(  Oh, well.  

All this shopping around for oil took a couple of hours, then the 
oil change itself took another 15 minutes, then I had to clean up 
and stow all my tools again... and then it was getting late in the 
morning.  I was feeling rushed, a bit ripped off, a triffle 
worried about the increasing political violence and how our next 
leg would take us right the mountains that were reputed to be 
strongholds of Zapatista rebel supporters, and to top it all off, 
Christa and I had had a fight about some spare parts that had gone 
missing (I had asked her, in an exasperated tone, &quot;Did you throw 
out the bag with the spare parts in it?&quot;  This was a Bad Idea.)

Finally we were up and running, and we pulled out of the Oaxaca RV 
Park and headed East on Hwy 190 to meet Hwy 175 North, which we 
would take to Veracruz and the Gulf.  On the way out of town, we 
passed PEMEX station with a big line-up: I checked the fuel gauge 
and saw we had a little under half a tank.  I was still feeling 
pretty annoyed at the way the day was going, so I passed it by 
because the last thing I wanted was to wait 20 minutes in the 
blazing sun for gas when we're running late already, and also 
thinking that we'd hit another station in one of the smaller towns 
up ahead.  Bad Idea.

We left the city behind us, and turned onto Hwy 175 for Veracruz.  
Almost immediately, we started climbing.  The road narrowed, and I 
shifted down to 3rd, then to 2nd.  The road started to twist 
sharply, and I had to slow waaay down for curves that forced me to 
lean far forward in my seat so I could look through the passenger 
side window to sight through the curves.  At this speed, I fell of 
the power curve for second gear, so we were climbing in 1st gear.  
At times, I was unable to get back up the second gear for the 
straight sections, because we'd lose too much momentum in the 
shift.  Our oil temperature gauge, which had been sitting around 
235, was climbing: 240...  250... 260... 270...  275!   280!!!

We continued to wind up the face of the mountains, and we had 
spectacular views of Oaxaca and the valley below.  Far below.  We 
climbed up canyon after canyon.  Often, we could see the road cut 
running up to and along the top of the mountains high above us, 
but when we got there, we saw that that mountain had been only a 
foothill to much, much higher mountains, and the road cut could be 
seen crawling up the sides of those mountains as well.  And so on.  
Mountain range and range, higher and higher, never really dropping 
from one range to the next.  Always climbing, with our engine 
running hotter and hotter.  There were no pull-outs, no guard-
rails, few places to pull over to stop.  A couple of times we did 
stop to let the engine cool, but the outside temperature was so 
high that 15 minutes at the side of the road would only let the 
oil temperature drop from 280 to 265 degrees.  We continued on, 
and I kept my eye on the temperature gauge, keeping our speed low 
and using as little throttle as I could.  The high oil temps were 
only part of the reason I was adopting this driving style: I'd 
noticed that we were down to less than a quarter tank of fuel, and 
we had yet to pass a town with a store, much less a gas station.

As we continued to climb, we passed out of the dry desert of the 
valley and into more and more lush rain forest.  Soon, the road 
was wet with water dripping from vine-draped trees overhanging the 
road, and clouds of steam drifted in the valleys below and down 
from the slopes above.  Water rushed down in cascades under 
concrete slab bridges or washed across the road.  Vines draped 
down over the road, as low as they could hang until the transport 
trucks would clip them off at 15 feet or so.  At times the forest 
canopy was so dense our headlights actually illuminated the way in 
front of us.  Jungle plants with leaves the size of the side of 
our camper fought for space along the side of the road, and of 
course most of the warning signs were overgrown and had been 
swallowed up by the jungle.  The temperature gauge had steadied 
out at 285 degrees. 

As we rounded one corner, a bright blue macaw flew out of the bush 
beside us and in front of our car.  Christa and I looked at each 
other in disbelief.  This was _real_ jungle, like &quot;me Tarzan&quot; 
stuff.  I looked for a place that would be safe to pull over so I 
could take a picture of us and our camper in this unbelievable 
jungle, but couldn't find one.  We drove on, and continued to 
climb.

The road kept twisting higher and higher, and soon we left the 
jungle below us, and we moved into pine, then oak and scrub.  We 
were driving the ridges again, with impossibly deep valleys on 
either side of us, empty space yawning just beyond edges of the 
pavement.  With the fuel gauge needle well into the red, I found a 
spot pull over.  I pulled the six-gallon jerry can off the roof, 
and poured every last drop into the gas tank.  Getting back in the 
camper, the fuel gauge read just under 1/3 of a tank.  Six 
gallons.  On roads like this that gave us about one hundred miles.  
I looked at the map, and it didn't look promising.  Stupid!  How 
could I have let myself get cocky enough to pass a gas station 
with only a half tank of gas?  I said encouraging things to 
Christa, trying to sound confident and unconcerned, but I think 
she could read what I was really thinking.  She was good enough to 
act like she was buying what I was saying, knowing that I already 
had enough on my mind with the twisting narrow road, roadblock 
concerns, a very hot engine, and too little fuel.

After a while, the road no longer climbed non-stop, but 
alternately climbed and descended as we crossed each set of 
mountains in the highlands.  Still no sign of gas, and I began to 
put the clutch in on descents or any other time I could afford to 
go without power from the engine.  1/4 tank... into the red... 
halfway into the red.  The road wound on through the empty, dusty 
highlands, and only rarely would we pass another car.  I had begun 
a new mantra: stupid! stupid! stupid! stupid!  I shifted down 
again for another climb.

We ground up and up again.  The fuel gauge faithfully reported 
what was left of our fuel: we were nearing the end of the red, and 
soon the needle would be off the scale, pointing at the black 
blankness to the left of the scale.  Borrowed time.  I knew the 
gauge well enough that the edge of the red really meant we had 
about 1 1/2 to 2 litres of gas left: 10 miles on a good day.  We 
were almost there, and were the hell were we?  Around the next 
corner a house appeared, then another, then a big green sign: 
PEMEX!  Gas!  I could see the station now: were they open?  Would 
they have any gas?  We pulled in, and not only were they open, but 
they had unleaded fuel!  Smiling, laughing, we jumped out of the 
camper, hugged each other, and asked the rather confused-looking 
attendant to fill it up.  I took the jerry can off the roof again, 
and had him fill that one up, too.  Thank the gods for the jerry 
can.  I had really saved our butts.  

The guy at the station filled both our tanks to overflowing (he 
fit nearly 70 litres in the gas tank!), and tipped him wildly.  I 
guess we were drawing on some of that good karma we'd built up 
earlier in the trip!  We got back in the camper and I moved away 
from the pumps to the edge of the lot to check the oil.  Our oil 
temperature had dropped from 290 degrees to 275 while we'd been 
taking on fuel.  I opened the engine compartment lid, and pulled 
out the dipstick.  It looked a little low, so I topped it up.  As 
I was replacing the oil filler cap, my other arm brushed the rear 
bumper.  I jumped back, yowling in pain: I had burned the back of 
my arm on the bumper!  Now _that's_ a hot engine!

As we pulled out of the station, a couple of young Mexicans stuck 
out their thumbs.  We asked were they were going, and they were 
going our way.  Eager to repay the gods for giving us the gas 
station, we had them pile into our van.  And a couple of their 
friends who just 'happened' to show up too.  So we ground up the 
mountainsides, Christa and me and 4 Mexicans and all their bags 
from the town market.  We talked haltingly with them about simple 
things, and every now and then one of them would yell &quot;Here!  
here!  Stop!,&quot; and we'd squeeze over to the edge of the road and 
let them out.  They'd each ask how much we would like in payment 
for the ride, and each time they'd smile wide when we told them we 
wanted nothing, that it was our pleasure.  All too soon, the last 
of them had gotten out, and were alone on the highway again.

After a while, the road began to drop, and the humidity climbed.  
&gt;From some of the passes, we caught glimpses of the coastal plain 
below.  I had learned my lesson on the mountain road into Oaxaca 
from the Pacific, and I took my time winding down, down, down the 
steep mountainsides, keeping the brakes cool and our speed very 
slow.  

When we hit the flats between the mountains and the Gulf of 
Mexico, I was unable to decide which was more oppressive: the heat 
or the humidity.  I decided it was a non-issue.  I had sweat 
dripping off my wrists, nose, and chin, and the air felt hot going 
into my lungs.  Our camper liked the flats better than the 
mountains, I think, but its oil temperature still hovered around 
255 degrees.  

We set out across the plain for the Gulf, where we would intersect 
highway 180 south-east of Veracruz.  We chugged across the plains 
driving on flat, straight roads built on berms above miles upon 
miles of sugar cane fields.  Every 20 or 30 miles, we'd pass a 
huge sugar refining plant, belching thick black, sweet-smelling 
smoke into the air.  All along the road, workers drove huge wagon 
trains piled insanely high with sugar cane from the fields to the 
plants.  Each of these cane trains was pulled by a large tractor 
or truck, and the tractor was followed by a half dozen or more 
very large trailers that were constantly having sugar cane fall 
from them as they swayed and rolled down the road at perhaps 10 
miles per hour.  Often the trailers were loaded so high the five 
foot high tires on the trailers were squashed nearly flat.  The 
road was strewn with a slippery sticky mush of flattened sugar 
cane.  Passing these crazy trains was an entertaining exercise in 
skid control: applying throttle to pass would often start the rear 
wheels spinning, requiring correction of the resulting yaw through 
the sliding front wheels.  Pulling back in and braking presented 
similar problems.  

The weight of all these cane trailers was destroying the road bed.  
We were fortunate to be following a local in a passenger car: when 
the driver's brake lights would flash and the car would nearly 
disappear from sight then reappear a few seconds later, we knew 
there was a large pothole in the road ahead.  Several times every 
mile, we'd have to slow to a crawl, and work our way through a 
hole that could often span the width of the road, and be as much 
as 20 feet long and 3 feet deep.  Of course, there were no warning 
signs for any of this.  Gods help someone hitting one of these 
potholes at the posted 80 km/h speed limit.

We neared the coast as night was beginning to fall.  We fell in 
behind an express bus and followed it all the way to hwy 180 on 
the Gulf coast.  By the time we hit the coast, it was pitch dark.  
We decided to press on to Veracruz, only 70 more miles up the 
coast, before turning in for the night.  I found a large transport 
truck and followed it closely all the way into Veracruz.  We found 
the RV park listed in Carl Franz's book, and turned in for the 
night.

About 4:30 the next morning, we awoke to the sound of laughing, 
shouting, and talking just outside our camper.  Looking out, I saw 
that a bus load of Mexican tourists had been deposited next to us 
to watch the sun rise over the Gulf.  They laughed, yelled, and 
gave absolutely no indication of shutting the hell up.  We got up, 
made the bed, put everything away (and everything was drenched 
from the humidity), and closed the pop-top.  I jumped into the 
driver's seat and tried to run them all down as we pulled out.

We had used up the last of our Mexican cash, and we tried to get 
cash at one of the bank machines in town, but it was broken.  We 
went to a big hotel, but they wanted to charge us a criminal 
exchange rate to cash traveller's cheques.  We tried another bank 
machine: broken.  We drove north, figuring we'd find a place to 
get cash along the way.  Each town we stopped in either had no 
bank machine, had a bank machine that worked only for cards from 
their bank, or the machine was broken.  As it was Sunday, all the 
banks were closed.  We were down to 35 pesos, and we were hitting 
a lot of toll bridges at 5 pesos a piece.  Christa scrounged 
around in the van and found a few more pesos that had fallen down 
behind other things.  When we were down to eight pesos, we finally 
found a working bank machine.  Joy!  We filled up our fuel tank 
and bought junk food and some cokes to celebrate.

We had lunch at the side of the road just past Tuxpan, and when we 
pulled back onto the highway I looked in my rear-view mirrors and 
saw another mango breadloaf westy behind us!  I stuck out my hand 
and waved, and the driver waved back.  We pulled over and talked 
for a while.  The guy was named John LaPlante, and used to write 
for the Boston Globe.  Now he spends in winters driving his westy 
all over Mexico, and writing an occasional column called America 
on a Shoestring (but not for the Globe, I think).  We got to 
talking about our busses, and get this: not only were our campers 
the same colour, model, and year, but they were both originally 
purchased at the same dealership in Massachusetts!  We pulled our 
campers up beside each other, and got a local guy working in a 
nearby field to take a picture of us and our busses.  Neato!

We cruised along the flat and unremarkable coastal plains towards 
Tampico, where we'd heard from some people back in Oaxaca that you 
could sleep overnight in the airport parking lot for cheap.  By 
the time we finally found the airport it was dark, but when they 
told us that it would cost us 50 pesos to stay for a few hours 
until early morning, we just turned north, figuring to find a 
place to free camp.  Again, I found a large transport truck to hit 
the animals on the road for me, and I tucking in close behind and 
we drove into the night.

Over an hour later, we arrived in a town called Manuel and we 
decided to try our hand at street camping.  We found an empty 
street next to a vacant lot and a school, and settled in.  Half an 
hour later, as we were finishing our dinner, search lights blasted 
into the car, and men's voices and a big truck could be heard 
outside.  I crawled up to the front to take a look.  I opened the 
front door slowly, and saw 6 or 8 federales in black clothes with 
big guns.  I wished them good evening, and they asked what we were 
doing there.  I told them my wife was sick, and asked if we could 
park there for the night.  I assured them we would be gone first 
thing in the morning.  I told them we were Canadian and were 
heading home.  I asked them if they wanted to look inside, to 
check things out.  They said no, don't worry, take care of your 
wife.  I thanked them, and they wished us well.  

When we got up early the next morning, school kids were already 
milling around the school.  We quickly put everything away, and I 
fired up the camper.  I waved to one of the federales parked 
across the street as we pulled out.  He smiled and waved back.  
Whether they were making sure we'd move on or were always 
stationed there to watch the school kids, I'll never know.

After filling up with gas at the PEMEX in Manuel, we hit the road 
for Matamoros and the American border.  We cruised easily across 
the desert flats for a few hours, stopping only once for new wild 
flowers to stick in our coke-can blumenvase.  A few miles further 
on, we hit a check-point swarming with federales.  We stopped, and 
the guard asked us were we had come from, and were we were headed.  
Did we have any drugs?  No, no, I assured him.  He motioned us 
over to the side of the road, and asked us to open up the camper 
so he and some other agents could search the car.  No problem, I 
told him, and we did as we were told.  After a few minutes of 
snooping around, one guy at the back of the bus called me over and 
asking what this was, pointing under the rear cushion over the 
engine compartment.  He found were I had duct-taped over the hole 
left in the body by some fuel gauge sender replacement surgery.  I 
tried to explain why the body of the car was cut like that, but he 
had me drive over to a heavy-duty searching area on the other side 
of the lot.  There, they went over the car more carefully, and 
really focussed on the fuel gauge sender.  They piled into the 
back, removed the plate I had covering the hole, and yanked out 
the sender.  No fire extinguisher.  I brought them mine.  They 
asked me repeatedly if I had drugs stashed in the car.  Cocaine?  
Any cocaine?  They asked over and over.  Finally I got pissed off 
and asked them why they kept asking me the same question: I 
understood in the first twenty times, did they expect me to answer 
differently the 21st?

Some poor junior bastard had his whole arm inside the gas tank, 
feeling around for big packets of drugs taped to the inside of my 
tank.  One guy dropped a screwdriver into the tank, and spent a 
minute or two fishing it out.  The whole thing was such a comedy 
production that it was all I could do at times to keep from 
laughing.  Over an hour later, greasy, dirty, and with chemical 
burns from the gasoline, they gave up and let us go.  

A couple of hours later, we cruised into Matamoros where we did 
some last minute shopping for food, cheap beer, and big bottles of 
tequilla.  We stopped at the border to check our bus out of 
Mexico, and drove over the Rio Grande into Brownsville.  

And what a nice feeling it was to have the border guard ask us how 
long we'd been in Mexico and what our citizenship was.  In 
English.
