Subject: HELP!  Advice needed-79 Bus

Folks,
After 2 days of inspecting things, it is apparent that the gas tank in
my 79 bus is rusted on the bottom and leaking.  After replacing the filler
neck, and adding a little gas, it is obvious gas is getting to the tank, and
then dripping out(more like dripping fast.)

So, this means I need a good used gas tank to get THIS bus back on the road.
Anyone have one BTW??
Or, I could spare myself and buy another bus and keep this for parts
Anyone have a late breadloaf they want to get rid of cheap??

I'm really in a scramble here!  I am VERY attached to this bus, but at
the same time I need a vehicle to drive(like today).

What would you all do?  Get a tank this week, and install it next Sat.?
Or, go looking everywhere for another bus?

At the moment, the mechanicals of this bus are EXCELLENT, but the body is
definitely rusty, including the pedestal the gas tank sits on?

All opinions are welcome and needed!
Thanks,
Paul Wies
