&gt; &gt;  Sierra is another brand of phosphate FREE antifreeze.  I've used thiis
&gt; brand and had very good experience with it!
&gt; 

Sierra though phosphate free is also one of the new animal safe 
propylene? glycol formulations and has considerably lower heat transfer 
properties, check out Gerry's FAQ's.  A vanagon deserves only the 
best, the only two I have ever seen cheap are Prestone Longlife 
(silver jug used to say 4yr/46000 mile, now says 5yr/50000 mile 
reprinted the container primarily to say its compatible with the new 
GM Delco phosphate free fill) which is yellow in color and Zerex 
Extreme (also silver jug, yellow in color but it dissapeared from 
stores around here a year after it appeared 3-4 years back) both are 
$6-$8 the gallon depending on sales etc.  Prestone at every Walmart 
in america and a lot cheaper than VW.  I would still change either 
every 2 years in a Vanagon, and still pray a lot.
