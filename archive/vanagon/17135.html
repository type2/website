&gt; Hi all-
&gt;         I got the most monster wave from a guy in a vanagon today.  I was

&gt; vanagon shopping.  Anyway, it was the first wave I have gotten from anyone 
&gt; in a vanagon.  Me thinks that the vanagon owners are snobby around here.

I've waved at probably fifteen or twenty different Vans, buses, 
microbuses, Westy's and only one has waved back.  But, I've had three 
bugs and two little Jettas or Sciroccas (sp?) wave to me first!!!  The 
fact that they were young good looking women has nothing to do with my 
being so happy about it ; )
