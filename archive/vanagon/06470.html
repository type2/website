On this Wonderful day, I would like to announce that of the 2 members
of the Montana Vanagon society (we are kind-of busy holding down the
forth or so out here) one of us, namely me, received my long-awaited
pulley last night from UPS.  So at least 1 vanagon from the Montana
division will pretty soon be rolling again!
