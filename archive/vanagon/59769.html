Subject: (Fwd) Outrageous oil change prices

&gt;55 bucks for a simple oil change for my 95 eurobago.
&gt;That's crazy!!!

Forgive me for butting in, particularly as a newbie, but why not just 
do it yourself?  Oil changes are simple, even for the 
non-mechanically enclined.  I had to make a new filter wrench for my 
wife's Saab, but it can be done.

Having said all this, I dunno how hard it is on a VW bus.
