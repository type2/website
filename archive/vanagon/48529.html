Subject: Re: list stickers

this is the best plan i have yet heard.  we should not stick richard
with the cost of the stickers, and this allows us to avoid that, and to
distribute the cost of having spare stickers around to everyone.  i
would be happy to buy a share or two of stickers.

evan


&gt; cost thereof I would like to suggest a solution.  Don't print them until
&gt; you get the money in hand.  Here's the plan.
&gt; 
&gt; You offer sticker shares at $5, or something that makes numerical sense.
&gt; If you sell enough shares for a quantity price break then the purchaser of
&gt; each share gets 7 stickers.  Not enough orders then the share is worth 5
&gt; stickers.  You close the share selling at some fixed date, like maybe
&gt; Christmas.  After that point anyone who wants a sticker must buy it from
&gt; someone who ordered a share and therefore has stickers to sell.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with this plan is that it is a lot of bookkeeping for somebody.
&gt; Sticker share buyers could maybe fill out a little form to help with the
&gt; bookkeeping.  Like
&gt; 
&gt; name:    _________________________ | shares purchased:_____________
&gt; street:  _________________________ |        money collected:_________
&gt; City/state________________________ |        stamp enclosed? _________
&gt;                                    |  name again:____________________
&gt; Then maybe just tape the left half of the form to an envelope and mail the
&gt; stickers using the enclosed stamp.  Processing even a hundred of these
&gt; could be a pain, but we're all VW van owners.  What's a little discomfort
&gt; for all this community and history?
