Subject: Re: Mounting a BN-4

&gt; This reminds me.  The shop manual for my BN-4 (early '70s) says that
&gt; the heater mounts in the ``forward luggage area''.  Since this is an
&gt; Nth generation photocopy, the photograph of the installed unit is
&gt; completely undecipherable.  Now, most of my experience is with
&gt; microbusi, but I've been in a 1971 a few times.  What, precisely, is
&gt; the ``forward luggage area''?

The trunk in a Thing--it used the BN 4 also.
