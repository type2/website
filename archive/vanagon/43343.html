Subject: Westy Tent Pole~Follow up

On May 21, 1996 I wrote about a poential source for tent poles/corner
pieces. The same items were located at a local Phoenix  &quot;Fabric Depot&quot;
wholesale warehouse close-out type of store. I purchased the exact items as
mentioned below but at an extra dollar markup on each piece. So much for
&quot;wholesale.&quot;  I need to purchace and cut the metal conduit poles but I think
this works for me vs not being able to use the tent or paying out the &quot;ears&quot;
for the correct poles. I would recommend the $22.50 plus shipping price.
Out-the-door, the corner pieces along with with four double female connector
pieces for the legs (at $2.95 each) was $41.54.
$4.95 x 6 plus $2.95 x4 plus tax
You might forget about the leg pieces and search out adjustable poles from
camping or RV sources.
Happy Camping!

May 21, 1996 message as follows:
Specifically there is a source named &quot;Hillco Shade Canopies&quot; in Apple
Valley, CA (619) 242-8218 who sell heavier duty poles and corner units at
the Pomona, SanBernadino/National Orange and Victorville/SanBernadino swap
meets. I think that the corner pieces that are included in their canopy kits
would work great. All corners and poles are of the metal electrical conduit
quality. The HillCo folks sell corner pieces and peak/center pieces
separately or as a set. The corner pieces (Item# P3J) cost $3.95 ea. and the
Center peak pieces (Item# P3E) cost $3.95 each. The kit of 4xP3J and 2xP3E
costs $22.50. You need to find your own poles at the local hardware store or
specify exact dimensions to the HillCo folks and pay the shipping. I would
opt for the HomeDepot. I hope this helps someone.
