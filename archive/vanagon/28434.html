Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?


Just my 2 pence worth;

[on soapbox]

This kind of argument was exactly why I stopped reading
the vw newsgroups. Threads such as &quot;do vw owners get chicks&quot;, &quot;are
vw owners gay&quot; etc really pissed me off because they are irevelant
garbage that always turned into name calling.

I'm not being all PC about this ('cause believe me I'm not), but I am 
aware everytime I read my vanagon mail that I'm talking to 400+(?) 
different people with views that are probably very different to my
own. In common we've got love of vw busses (beer as well maybe?)
and not alot else. 

I don't give a pair of fetid dingos kidneys (ho hum- 
how unoriginal) what the argument is about because now it seems to be
getting personal, and that leaves a bad taste in my mouth when
I read my mail. 

Any chance of knocking it off?

[off my soapbox}
right, pub.
