I knew there was something else......
The tent that came with my bus attaches to the sides of the body at the 
rear door, it's roof being supported by the opened hatch. The question is 
- what good is it?
It's only an extension, approx 4-5 feet long and, of course, the width of 
the bus.  Is this a gear stowage area, or a place to work on the engine 
if it's raining. :-)
It's nicely made, has NO floor and has 2 pole-holes toward the rear edges of 
what would be the open hatch, allowing the closure of the door 
presumably. The tent is reinforced where the wiper contacts it. 

So, what the HECK is it??
