Subject: 1980 Model Confusion, lights update


I've got a 1980 Vanagon L Camper.

I called Euro-American RV Products to see about replacing the hook-ups 
and vents.  Though the person I talked to said that the '80 should not 
have the exterior vent.  It should only have the three hook-ups, and the 
refrigerator vent.  Though I have another vent, same height as the fridge 
vent, but about two feet to the left.  

He said that the sink water should drain out a tube just below the 
driver's side door, which it does.  But the extra vent was to drain water 
in the older models, not in an '80.

Mine looks kind of like this:
Window----------------------|   
?Vent?          Fridge Vent

                Hook-up Hook-up Hook-up

What is this vent for?

***Thanks to everyone who is helping me figure out my headlights 
problem.  I took the dash apart, unscrewed the fuse box to check the 
wiring, and checked the headlights switch.  This morning they didn't 
work, but when I got home from class they came on just as suddenly as 
they went off.  I assume I have a grounding problem, and that I need to 
check the insulation on the wires, or maybe a loose wire.  Maybe there's 
just a ghost living in my van.  It sure act spooky sometimes!

later,

Kyle
