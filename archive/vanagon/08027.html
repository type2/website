Subject: quiet list.

I've gotten several messages from people saying they've received nothing 
on the list.  I have NO idea what's going on, but clearly no one is 
receiving anything, otherwise the traffic would continue, right?  Anyway, 
I'm looking into it, but I can't any reason on my end why the list would 
not be working.  Maybe it's because I stayed home yesterday?
Anyway, at least for today, don't send email to me saying that you 
haven't received any mail and I'll keep working ont it, k?

Thanks.
