Terry,

No, I said it right.  Perhaps I didn't state it clearly.  I run paralleled
batteries in both my 67 baja, 65 bus and 73 Datsun camper (3 batteries) to
power a variety of things from computers to high power radio transmitters.

Attempts to use deep-cycle batteries in series, or series-parallel, looks
good on paper but fails the test of practicality/low-cost due to the details
of isolation.  My experience here ranges from our 48vdc, 1200 A/hr
'submarine' battery atop a local mountain to stand-by emergency lighting
systems, both covered in my 5-part Emergency Power series of articles
published in CTM in 1987.

ps - the Dodge system mentioned was in a 1924 tourer we used for desert
travel.
