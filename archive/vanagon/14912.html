OK, How about something like this, frankly we the easterners seem
divided, most 5-10 posts seem to want a central or southern leg
although a around 5 want a northern leg, how about a route that
consolidates both in the beginning then we split, I envision something
like this,

START St. Louis, Missouri, May 29 or whatever, everyone takes most
direct route there with as much caravaning as possible along the way,
the northeast all comes down onto I70 for instance, the mideast over
on US50, I64, or I40, and the southeast up on I75, I24 or whatever, we try
to pick people up on the way, so that each incoming route has 3 or 4
buses together by the time we hit St. Louis.

&gt;From St. Louis we all take US50 out, this is the origional coast to
coast road, hell books are written about its attractions, some of the
best 2 lane blacktop (OK 4 lane a lot of it) left in the US, speed limit
is 55 so we don't feel pushed, we hit a stop on 50, all easterners
together until we get to Winchester, VA, I note that last leg through
WV, MA, and VA should prove an interesting test for all VW transporters,
some pretty rough but beautiful mountain driving.

At Winchester we all pick up I81 down to I66 and start heading east,
when we hit the top of Skyline Drive the southern tour splits off down
the drive through Shenandoah Natl Park (beautiful) the northern tour
keeps on to DC, then heads up the coast to Cape Cod, Maine, wherever, as
I plan to go south I don't know.

The southern tour proceeds down Skyline all the way through the park to
I64 which we take through Charlottesville and Richmond all the way to
Newport News, through the Fort Monroe Tunnel and onto 168 through
Chesapeake then into NC.  Down to Point Harbor, across to Kitty Hawk
then down the Outer Banks, around Cape Hatteras, and culminating in the
ferry ride back to Swan Quarter. From here 264 back to I95 then everyone
finds their best way home.

I am very interested and would help plan the trek on 50 and down Skyline
but have never been to the Outer Banks and someone else would have to
figure out those parts, of course people going north would need to
figure their own plans but most importantly I think we should keep it
all together, easterners united for a least a day or two out of St.
Louis, as always, lets hear some feedback, anyone interested in the
proposed route?, better suggestions are welcome, bring an extra engine,
them mountains can be killers.
