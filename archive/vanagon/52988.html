Subject:      Re: 97 EV's


 The sporadic sightings and information about 97 EV's suggests that they
have already been imported, at least in a few places. As I recall, they
have been examined in North Carolina, Missouri (Bap?), and Seattle (Rick
Gordon). My local dealer says there are no plans to bring them in here
until at least next spring and that they haven't even gone into production
yet in Germany. He was told that at a New England regional sales meeting.
This does not seem to jibe with the above info. Are the ones people have
seen only Winnebagos? That could explain it. Or perhaps they're doing test
marketing in places where they think they'll sell. Also Rick Gordon mentioned
seeing tests of traction control. Where Rick? Could you give more details?
