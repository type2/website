Subject: RE: buying a used tranny.

Bite the bullet and buy a trans from Transform, NOT from MOFOCO. These boys 
were no use to me when  having bought a &quot;Remanufactured&quot; trans from them with 
a 12/12 warranty,The main pinion bearing crapped out at 14,000 mi. Now I 
understand that technically the warranty was up but they would'nt even talk to 
me. And if the trans was reman.the main bearing should have held up. Just my 
two cents worth.Good luck. Tom
