	I'm with you Dave. 50amps _at_14V (what alternator put out) is .94hp,
a very significant fraction for a VW at idle. I can hear the
effect of turning on the headlamps on most cars- even my Corrado.
And 2 55 Watt headlamps are only 8-9 amps- of course, other lamps
begin to add up too...

	Theory's great when it explains experiences you've had, or
allows you to make predictions. W's theory is that alternators
present negligable load to the engine. My experience and David
Carment's are that headlamps load the engine, and the alternator
is the most likely connection. Stephen Hawking writes wonderfully
about this when he compares Aristotle to Einstien in &quot;A Brief History
of Time.&quot; A good companion volume for Muir's aircooled book...
sorta the next stage after St. John tells you what to believe,
Hawking talks about how to figure out what to believe.

	Cheers!

	Technical annex:

(Conversion factors from CRC handbook, 54th ed.
Watt * 0.001341 = horsepower
Watt * 3.41443 = B.t.u./hr
Watt * 44.2537 foot-pounds/minute)

	So I conclude that turning a wrench with 44.2537 foot-pounds of
torque for a minute makes a Watt, and turning a wrench with 220 foot-pounds
of torque for a minute would make five Watts, enough to light up the
little dome as bright as the battery/generator/alternator do. Sounds
about right. That's why my 20 Watt bike lamp runs on a battery and
not a generator.
