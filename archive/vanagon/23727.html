When I went on my lunch break today I noticed shifting
was very stiff in my '65 bus. I didn't have to force into
any gears but it sure wasn't the fluid motion I was used
to. I bought the bus 2 months ago knowing that 4th gear pops
out on ocassion and would have to replace the tranny at some
future date.

Is this stiff shifting an indication my tranny is about to go
or something I can simply check and adjust?

Your comments would be greatly appreciated so as I could avoid
being stranded somewhere. This list has been a great resource
for a not-so-experienced mechanic like myself and I'm grateful
to all those who have responded to my sometimes trivial questions.

Thanks.
