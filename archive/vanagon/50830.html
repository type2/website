Ask your dealer for the &quot;universal&quot; O2 sensor. It's the same for the Vanagon 
but you have to add the right clip on the end.  Chances are though, your 
dealer might not know what your talking abount.  (They are about $50).  Also, 
check your local parts store, I was surprised to find Pep Boys carried it here 
in PA.

Subject:  90 hesitates when cold

Now that its turning colder, my 90 tends to sometimes have a hard time
starting, or at least idling after it does start.  And once I feel as if
I have let it warm up sufficiently, it'll try to stall out at the first
stop sign/light I come to on my way to work. 

I'm fairly sure these symptoms have been covered on the list before, but
I have to admit that since it didn't apply to me at the time, I ignored
it.  Seems to me it had to do with a temp sensor somewhere, but which
one and how do I find it.

Also, my van just reached 90,000 miles and its time for a tune up.  is
there a concesus on whether or not to change out the O2 sensor (the
cheapest I could find is $108.).  And what else should I tackle while
I'm at it (other than the obvious)?

Thanks,
Ian
