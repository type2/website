Howdy all. Thanks to the overwhelming response to the extra shirts, they
are gone as well...
So, please don't ask for any. They were snapped up over the weekend.
Anyway, for those who have still not ordered, and are still wanting,
wait until the spring (like I said last time...)
:)
and we'll see what happens
Thanks again...
Richard
