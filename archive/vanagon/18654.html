Subject: BODEGA BAY L(!)&amp;F(?)


Back from the Bodega Bay outing, and at the computer.

The weekend was fun, and we met great people (see numerous Bodega BAy 
updates from Martha),  thanks for showing up... 

The ride back to Davis was w/o events to tell about; we stopped in 
Petaluma and walked through the historic downtown area with beautiful 
Victorian houses.

At home we realized that my finnish fish (filet) knife (long narrow 
blade, light brown wooden handle, light brown leather sheath) was 
missing, and we figured that we left it on the 'food' table were it had 
been used to cut the cheesecake.

Has any of the participants that left later as we did seen it, or taken 
it along? Would be great to have it back.

Hope to meet al of you again at some of the next West coast 'outings'.

Marcus (and family)
