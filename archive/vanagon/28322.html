Does anyone know whether this video is the one entitled,

&quot;The Volkswagen Story&quot;

and is narrated by Tom Skeritt (I think that's his name)?

If so, I already have it and you'll save me from calling VW.

I can say that if this is the same video, it's good.  Mostly at the 
beginning, when they're actually covering the history.  Later on, it does 
degrade into a sales pitch of sorts, but it's not unbearable.

TIA/kw
