I'm having a dispute with a vendor from whom I bought special VW head studs. 
Three of their $130 per set head studs failed during engine assembly and 
they are blaming my click-type torque wrench.  Consequently, I am sending 
the tool to a place to be tested, repaired and certified.  I'll post test 
results here in a week or two.
