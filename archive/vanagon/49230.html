Disclaimer up front - fair warnings, etc.:  this was a problem with a
previous vehicle that also had removable bulb headlights.  Typically these
are 'aero' headlights, and quite expensive to replace, so I figured I had
nothing to lose and put 'em in the dishwasher - upside down of course, &amp; on
hottest water setting using Cascade dishwasher detergent.  They came out
crystal clear &amp; the reflectors looked perfectly polished.  It was done to
Nissan headlamps, &amp; I'm not sure it'll work on European headlamps, but for
the several hundred $'s to be saved by not having to replace the 4 I'll be
trying it on my '87 RSN. (*) Incidently, the increase in light output was
dramatic - they dim over the years from this misting/frosting so slowly that
you think your 'old' vehicle has outdated lights compared to new ones - then
you get the original brightness back &amp; you go 'ooooohh - nice'.

(*) = RealSoonNow = things I want to do to *my* car wait 'til every other
project is done
