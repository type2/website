Subject: Tires again, almost

Yesterday I got my first flat.  Pulled out the sack-o-tools that came
with the van only to fine the 19mm socket was starting to s t r e t c h 
.  Called AAA just in case and proceeded to work at them lugs.  Got the
tire off just as AAA arrived so I let them tighten up the lugs (lazy
me).  Just had to kick myself for mot checking the sack-o-tools and
putting in a breaker bar with a 19mm impact socket in there like I did
on the old 70 Westy.

Got home and figured I'd check out the tire, I did touch the curb while
parking and thought &quot;oh sh*t, sidewall damage&quot;, only to find out there
was not hole in the tire.  I hit the valve cap on the curb and mangled
it enough that it depressed the valve stem.

Oh happy me, just figured I'd share some good with all.
