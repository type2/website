&gt; Yes!!  you are correct, that IS what the RV guy told me, I'm just having
a
&gt; little lapse of memory (what little of that I have left!).  He said the
&gt; amonia boils, etc. etc. etc. 
&gt; But that's why it has to be level anyway.  I got this info from the owner
&gt; of Major's RV Center on Cape Cod.  He deals with Dometic and other
fridges
&gt; that work the same way.  
&gt; Sorry for the wrong info.

&gt; &gt; For your edification the Dometic fridge does not contain freon. It uses
&gt; &gt; an amomnia (sorry spelling?!?) compound. Not that that helps us
&gt; understand/
&gt; &gt; use the fridge any better.
