Subject: Re: NON VW...electric cars

there is a 70 bus that has been converted to electric power sitting dusted up
on my street. The gas filler flap opens to reveal an electrical socket. The
whole thing has been very professionally done but it only goes 15 miles at
most between fill-ups and it costs twice as much as running on gasoline.
If you want to know more let me know I will try to get the guy to get in
touch with you. I was going to buy it minus electric stuff as it is an
exceptionally clean rustfree bus.
