Subject:      Dometic fan cycle question

Our Dometic fridge fan in our '85 Westy, when running on A/C, seems to
cycle alot.  It goes on for about 5 seconds then off for about 10 seconds
and repeats this for what seems like an eternity, especially when your
trying to sleep.  Is this normal or should it run longer in the cycles?  It
doesn't seem to make any difference how warm or cold it is outside.  It may
do this also when running on propane, I just haven't noticed.

Thanks in advance for &quot;V-Wisdom&quot;
