Most mechanics, dealer or otherwise, bill you for time using a &quot;flat rate
manual,&quot; which is simply a book telling how long the job *should* take.
This is a pretty fair system, since a fast mechanic is rewarded for his
efforts, and you don't pay extra if your mechanic is exceptionally slow.
At many shops, the mechanics are paid not for the hours they work, but for
the hours of flat rate time on the work they do.

&gt;stayed with the van this time to watch them. It only took them 4 hours to
&gt;complete the job, this disturbs me because the first time they did it they
&gt;kept it and billed me for the whole 8 hour day. Is it customary for the
&gt;dealer to bill you for hours that they don't even spend on your vehicle?
