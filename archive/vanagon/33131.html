Talking about the distributor reminded me of one really stupid thing I
have done at least twice.  While checking the point gap, I put a
crescent wrench on the alternator pulley bolt to turn over the engine.
Problem is I occasionally forget to remove it, and when I go to start
the bus, it turns over about 1/2 turn and then stops.  The first time it
happened I thought the battery was dead, but of course the wrench had
butted up against the body and prevented the alternator from turning.
DOH!!!!!!
