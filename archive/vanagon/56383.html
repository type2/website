&gt; I think it's a generally accepted practice of not keeping gasoline inside
&gt; of a vehicle, I suppose the main risk is in case of an accident, things

&gt; van...I've carried a gallon in a rocket box on past cross-country trips.
&gt; On the other hand, I suppose if you're travelling somewhere so remote
&gt; that there's no gas stations around, or not many, chances are there
&gt; aren't many other cars around either, so there's less to worry about.
&gt; Personally, I wouldn't do it unless absolutely necessary...

&gt; &gt; I was wondering if it is safe to carry an extra gallon of gas in a gas
&gt; &gt; canaster inside my 1980 camper.  I'm sure some people do it.  Could you
&gt; &gt; put the canaster in one of the cabinets?  (since my gas meter is broke, I
&gt; &gt; have to judge the level on milage)

It is strictly illegal in several, if not all states, to carry gasoline
in the passenger compartment of a vehicle.

That said,

Whenever I'm travelling in incliment weather, overnight, on long trips,
or in the backcountry; where I quite likely would be in *serious* danger
if I ran out of gas - I carry ~1.5 - ~2.5 (depends on which can I grab)
in the 'footlocker' in the lower cabinet of my Syncro Westy.  The can
just fits, &amp; stays out of my way &amp; away from hot things.

However, I *do* remove it for daily driving, not only is it very
dangerous, particularly in hot weather, but the fumes will quickly
permeate the whole vehicle.

So, my advice is to *FIX* the gas gauge, &amp; *DON'T* carry gas in the car.
