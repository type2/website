&gt;The statement from phoenix about the lists being students just giving
&gt;unknowing opinions. i think is S**T.  i have not used the list very long but
&gt;it has been very helpful and entertaining. i do not take every statement as
&gt;the word of god but as helpful direction from people who love the bus.

&gt;&gt;Tim, 
&gt;&gt;I'm sure that most of us would agree with you. I posted the message to
&gt;&gt;point out that some &quot;all knowing&quot; gurus are closed minded. I prefer to
think that even if I end up throwing away 90% of the stuff read on the list
but learn anything or gain insight as to other peoples views and opinions
then the list is worth my time. Everyone needs to manage their time to suit
themselves. On the other hand I'll defend anyone's right to state what they
believe to be true- even if I totally disagree with them. It's better than
none of us being able to express ourselves. BTW I like to use asterisks * in
appropriate spots and still get my msg across...
