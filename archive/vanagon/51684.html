Subject: Re: Hey California folks

What you hear is correct. I bought a Syncro in Colorado last Spring.
Fortunately it had the California exemption sticker, otherwise I would have
had to pay the fees. The sticker was located on the back of the rear license
plate hatch, though I have heard that it can be on the driver's door jamb. I
was surprised to find that I had to pay California sales tax, thinking that
since it was bought out of state it would be exempt.
Watch out for rust.
