Hi Everyone,

Quick question,

I'm found a '85 Vanagon in S.C.  I'm thinking of buying it to run around
during the week and keep the miles of my '91 Westy.  It's not a westy but
looks in great condition.  Any ideas what it's worth?

Info:  '85 Vanagon - Ugly Brown Color
             65,000 Miles
            A/C and it works
            Auto Trans
             Needs tires
             Interior is great

Just looking for a ballpark figure.

Thanks,
