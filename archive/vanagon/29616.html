Subject: swapping Splitty speedo's??

i want to swap my current speedo in my 65' westy from a mph (miles/hour)
speedo to a km (kilometer/hour) speedo that i recently acquired.

aside from the mechanics of swapping speedo's, are there any
recalibation/modifications  needed to have the km speedo accurately reflect
the speed (or lack therof ;) that i am driving??

btw what have people used to replace the little plastic &quot;filters&quot; that
cover over the idiot lights and give you those pretty red lights etc.??
sorry for the lack of tecky discription.

I was thinking of replacing mine with coloured acetate from an art supply
store but wanted to get other opinions.

michael
