Subject: Oil Light Update - Bentley book problems

     
     
     If you're following this &quot;serial&quot;, you might remember that I've been 
     slowly getting the oil sensing system back to factory specs.  The 
     final problem is that when the oil's hot, the 0.9bar sensor is setting 
     the system (light and buzzer) off after about a 5-second coasting at 
     around 2200 RPM.  I'm gonna suspect a weak sensor switch and replace 
     it.
     
     Well, I determined to do the job last evening (after the car cooled 
     off from the daily commute).  Spent the wait studying the Bentley 
     book.
     
     First problem - the book indicates that one can access the sender by 
     &quot;sliding the exhaust pipe cover to one side - screw is under the oil 
     pump&quot; or somesuch nonsense.  I'd suggest they send a staffer out to 
     the parking lot and try this - it bears no relation to the actual car 
     (at least the '91 - and I DO have the latest edition!).
     
     My solution after &quot;noodling&quot; everything out for about an hour is to 
     loosen the alternator and get the belt out of the way, then you can 
     get a 24MM socket over the sender (after the wire's removed).  Only 
     problem is that I need a deep socket.  By now it's 8:45, too late to 
     get to Sears.
     
     Button everything back up (I thought).  Take a short test drive, and 
     hit the sack.
     
     Next morning - off to work.  On the freeway when the alternator light 
     comes on.  Here's my exit.  Coast off the exit with the engine shut 
     down, round the corner and pull into a parking lot.  Rolled the 
     alternator (and water pump) belt and it came off the main.  I guess it 
     wasn't tight enough.  Not broken, but I recall that a rolled belt is a 
     dead belt.  Nevertheless, I reinstall it so's I can get to the parts 
     house (service stations are no help any more).  It only lasts a mile, 
     so I call Dad (same guy who accompanied me on the &quot;Odyssey&quot; to buy the 
     Vanagon) to take me to the place.
     
     Second problem - the book can tell me how to rebuild a wasserboxer, 
     but their only suggestion as to V-belt installation is somethin like, 
     &quot;correct belt tension is very important to proper operation of the 
     engine and accessories - we suggest you have VW service or a competent 
     repair shop perform this procedure.&quot;
     
     Geesh!
