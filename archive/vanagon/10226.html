Subject: Re: 20% discount at West Coast Metric


&gt; I just thought I would mention a postcard I got today from WCM.  It says 
&gt; a 20% discount until January 31st, $25 min. purchase (after discount).  
&gt; 1-800-247-3202, mention #23.

I went in yesterday to their shop and mentioned the discount and they
told me I needed the actual postcard to get the 20% off.  I proceeded
to show them that I was going to be spending _a lot_ of money and that
my body had the postcard and I could get it if I had to, but it seemed
kinda silly for me to have to get it.  They persisted so I will have
to get the card from my friend and return another day.  Now I won't be
as happy a customer though, but I will feel good getting mega $$ off
on my order!

So, the scoop on the discount is that it is a one-shot per postcard
deal and the postcard must be surrendered at the time of purchase.
