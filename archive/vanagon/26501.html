Subject: So long, for now

Dear Folks,
Things have been getting pretty hectic around here, lately, and getting more
so every day. My RN boards are coming up. I gotta find me a new job. Gotta do
the two I already have. Not to mention the slowly evolving body project that
is my '76 Camper! So, I just have to get off this list for a while until I
set things straight. Just don't have time to take in all that I find of
interest on this list. I want to thank everyone who has helped me throughout
my re-build and what-not. Best Wishes and Good Luck to Bob and Grendel.
See you all around the corner!
Chris
'76 Camper
