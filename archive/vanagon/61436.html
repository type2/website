If the vehicle is a pre 86 model the smaller tubes would need to be
upgraded to the larger ones. If so the holes in the cross members need to
be enlarged. probably labor intensive. I would search the archives.

&gt;Where did that price come from?  Is that including all the hoses in 
&gt;the van?  
&gt;Seem excessive to replace the two tubes.  Figure three or four hours 
&gt;labor 
&gt;plus parts.

&gt;
&gt;Hi all
&gt;I had my Transporter checked, and the mechanic said that the long
&gt;coolant pipes under tha car were leaking. Replacement costs $1200. I
&gt;wonder if it would be possible to use reinforced plastichoses to 
&gt;replace
&gt;the bad parts of the pipe. Any experiences?
&gt;Thanks for many valuable and entertaining contributions.
&gt;-- 
&gt;Have fun!
