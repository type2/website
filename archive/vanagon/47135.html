Subject: Re: Traveling Questions

&gt;&gt; Route:  From Dallas/ Ft Worth, I35 North all the way to Duluth, MN.  
&gt;&gt; &gt;From Duluth, I will travel to International Falls on US 53.  I am 
&gt;&gt; pretty sure that once in Ontario, I will be on my own. 
&gt;
&gt;This is 2nd hand info, but the original owner of my '88 Westy (who 
&gt;drove it for 320k) had a fondness for Don Valley VW in Toronto. So 


Drive the extra 20 miles east to Owasco VW in Whitby.  They are big Westy 
dealers, maintain a rental fleet and are way way better at vanagons than Don 
Valley, who took 6 months to NOT fix my FI system under warranty.  I quit 
when they tried to tell me 'they all run like that'.   Tim Smith
