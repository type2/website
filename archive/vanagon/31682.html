Subject: Re: 66 Camper


&gt;Seen in the Atlanta paper two weeks ago for $3000 and now today for $2500: VW
&gt;66 Split Window  bench seat pop-top camper. Serious inquiries only.
&gt;770-977-4982.

I am very familiar with this bus (used to own it) if anyone has any
questions about it.  I can probably tell you more about it than the
present owner can.
