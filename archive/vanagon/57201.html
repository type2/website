Subject: Hose Size ???

Hello Folks,
	I need some help. I have a leaking water line on my '86 (2.1). It is the
hose that comes off the left head (at the rear) and goes to the  tube assy
that runs around the engine compartment.
	I went to the dealer, he can get it a week from Monday (24th) for $40.14.
For an extra $6 I could get it on the 19th. Do to work I need it running
before then. the VW p/n is 025-121-058-M, it's in my Bentley page 19.14
(the upper far left hose on the page). It has a 90* bend where it attaches
to the head.
	Now for my question, does anyone know the diameter of the fitting on the
head? If I knew what size to get I could make one. 
	I'd like to minimize the mess so I don't want to take to old one off until
I have another to slip on, I need to know what size to look for.
	Any help would be appreciated, maybe you have a head laying around and you
could get a quick measurement from it???
	Thanks,
	
Rob
