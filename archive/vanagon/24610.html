Subject: side impact &quot;beams&quot;




I was at the junkyard the other day, prowling around for this and that 
when I noticed a Passat that had a severe frontal impact. The crash had 
caused some of the side molding to come loose and underneath was what I 
can only guess as being side impact protection. It comprised of two 
pieces of 3/4&quot; diameter, thick wall steel tubing welded together in 
parallel. At either end they were welded to a bracket which was screwed/bolted
to the door.
So what? 
Well I was just surprised at them being outside of the door. I 
had always imagined them to be hidden inside along with the window 
mechanism .

(not much to do with Vanagons, eh?)
