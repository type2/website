Subject: VAnagon-Bad Lifter

I was trying to be nice to my '84 Vanagon this winter by letting it relax ( 
I've 
been driving my '83 GTI. Unfotunately now when I start it (after a 2 week rest)
a lifter is making noise. This happened once before but after a few minutes
it went away.
This time it is not going away. Is there a way I can detrmine with some 
certainty exactly which lifter is bad. 
Also, does anybody have any experiences replacing lifters in a Waterboxer.
