Subject:      Re: Cupholders

I also need cupholders.  Brown ones for my '85.  The dealer says brown is
no longer available.  I'm wondering if they may still be available in
Germany or if the Eurovan ones will work and if they are available in brown
or if someone else has a source.
Sincerely,
Craig Rogers
