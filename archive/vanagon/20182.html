     Hi all,
     
     I went BVF (British Volkwagen Festival) last weekend at Malvern.
     
     I liked the atmosphere there, it wasn't as crazy as the Pod, but you
     could still have a good time and relax knowing that some jerk wasn't
     gonna smash into your shiny motor!
     
     I arrived on Saturday afternoon, and missed the 'bargains' - 
     apparentley.
     
     I got the BMX straight out and scoooted round the site... after about 
     an hour I had four popout seals, some rear lenses and four NOS 
     vent-wing catches for my bus.
     
     The &quot;night-life&quot; was a bit dodgy, but I stumbled over Andy.E and we 
     chilled out with the buggy crew for a while, then went and watched the
     Carrabean (?) band.
     
     On the Sunday was the conqours. I entered the Samba and won squat :(
     
     The &quot;judge&quot; picked up on a few things like having Brazilian glass in 
     the popout windows and stainless steel cab door bolts. what a load of 
     old shite.
     
     Anyway it was a good, relaxed festival and it will be one that I go to 
     next year.
     
     see you all at Avon next weekend,
     
     Lee.
