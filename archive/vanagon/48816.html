Subject: Re: Help: Oil Pressure Light ('89 Vangagon)

If your oil light flickers; you need a rebuild.

If you think a higher oil pressure switch setting will protect your engine, 
you are mistaken. Whatever causes your engine to go down, it has happened long 
before your pressure drops;&gt;(

Bentley lists the minimum pressure on a warm engine with 20W oil as 7.1 
lbs/sq.in. The stock sender operates at 6.3 lbs/sq.in. Do you really think 0.8 
lbs/sq.in. is really going to help?

&gt; I know from what i've heard and read that there are a lot of people who
&gt; think that the oil light comes on too late, ie. at too low a pressure.
&gt; 
&gt; In my Bosch catalog i see that there are OP switches that come on much
&gt; sooner, at a higher pressure than stock, i don't have data at hand at the
&gt; moment.
&gt; 
&gt; One could replace the stock unit with one that switches at a higher than
&gt; stock pressure or add the heavier switch via a T and hook it up to an
&gt; extra oillight. If you want more data, let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; The stock unit can also be had with a M4 threaded connection instead of a
&gt; 6.3mm spade.
