Subject: VW's Hydraulic Shop Press

Don't you all have your own hydraulic shop presses?

The VW manual for my 90 4x Westy shows innumerable operations that are done
on a full fledged shop press. It is extreemly annoying to see so many
operations requiring this item and yet not having one.

I went to the auction of a VW dealer the other day and bought a 25 ton press
with all the little fittings but now I cannot figure out how to use it. 

Are the press fitting tools that come down from the press and that press
things supposed to be attached to the face of the press as it lowers? I cannot
 see any way to do this.

How are they protected from side to side slipping? I am afraid that if I take
one of these tools (which looks like the end of a sawed off broom handle) and
press on it it is going to go flying out sideways or slip when it is under
pressure. I am wondering if I am supposed to have the broom handle go up insid
e some kind of hole that will stabalize it. 

If nobody knows the answer, or even if they do, perhaps someone can tell me
of an automotive book they know about which gives instructions for the proper
use of a shop press.

If anybody expresses any interest to me (like telling me what price they
would pay), I might be able to buy another press this weekend at another VW
dealer auction I know about and am going to.
