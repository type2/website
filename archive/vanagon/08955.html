&gt;I have a '71 bus with the brake fluid reservoir behind the front
&gt;seat. It has been leaking at the seal between the bottle and
&gt;the tube. The seal, which looks like a cross between a bushing
&gt;and an O-ring, is toast (well, more like goop). I haven't
&gt;found a replacement through the usual channels (WCM, &amp;c). I
&gt;was thinking about wrapping the base of the bottle with string
&gt;or duck tape or something, then putting the clamp back on.

one thing that might work here is to find a suitable o-ring, and use three
of them together. or more if they'll fit.  also check with Bus Stop (Rocky
Mountain Motor works). and check the yellow pages for hydraulic suppliers
locally ... they usually have a wide assortment of o-rings and seals of all
sorts.
