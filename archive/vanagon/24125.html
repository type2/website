&gt; Hi All!
&gt; 
&gt; Just a quick question to all fellow Vanagonowners.  Is there a special way to
&gt; get the sparkplug wires off?  Just pulling like on the '72 doesn't seem to
&gt; work.  Please help!  I still haven't come up with the bucks ($85 at Westside
&gt; VW before my 15% VW Club discount) to get a Bentley.
&gt; 
When I put the platinums in I just unscrewed the plug wires.  Be careful
putting them back on.
