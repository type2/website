Subject: VW Westfalia '77 2ltr fan housing problem?

Hi all,

I have a problem with my van in that recently the fan decided to detach itself from its housing. The bolt onto the crank shaft was also loose (which probably caused the problem in the first place).

I have been in touch with Bob (veeduber_at_aol) who has given me some suggestions and some book titles to buy (and how I found this list, thanks Bob). However I live in Sweden and cannot find the books for sale here. Unfortunately I'm on my work computer and I do not remember the titles so I'll continue this mail when I get home (aggh!).

In the mean time perhaps you could think on the same question I posed to Bob. Where do I start? 

A VAG mechanic had a quick glance and suggested that the crank shaft is broken, however how can I check this with the engine in situ. The bolts holding the fan sheered off and I do not know where the bits are, is there an easy way to check if they are in the housing?

What would you do?

More on the books later.

All the best,
Ian
