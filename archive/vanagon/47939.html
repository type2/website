Subject: FS: 88 Doublecab synchro???
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom Forhan)

Well, thats about $14,000 US, and, given some discounting 
by the seller and a vehicle in good condition, an interesting deal.  
US buyers would hve truck dury (25%?) to deal with as well. 
 
&gt;From what I understand, Vanagon vehicles imported to Western 
Canada tend to already have all the relevant stickers for US import: 
DOT and EPA, but since this is a truck I'd definately double check. 
Rumor has it that the several Syncro Doublecabs legally into 
the US all came from western Canada. Its not reallly one of a kind, 
but really interesting. 
 
I'd say this is an opportunity that bears investigating...I want 
a syncro doublecab myself, but unfortunately have to many 
toys  already. Of course, my vacation is coming up....nah! 
 
Keep posting these sorts of great  finds!
