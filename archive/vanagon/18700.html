&gt;     Other women on this list, I'd like to hear from you. Any similar road
&gt; side tangos??? What should you do? What can you do?? It's improper to mace a
&gt; guy who insists on helping you change a flat, isn't it??????? *damn*   ; )

That reminds me of a coworker's experience.  He had stopped to help a woman
on the side of the road since it not good to be out alone in a rural part
of the state.  He goes up to see what's wrong and she pulls a gun on him.
He said he did not stay long.
