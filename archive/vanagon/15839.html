Subject: Generic Vanagon ?

Hi all,

I've been taking passive mental notes on Vanagons the last few years and 
have planted seeds in my wife's brain about the possiblility of buying 
one someday, hopefully thwarting out her inclinations towards wanting a 
Nissan Pathfinder or a (gagg, $$$) Range Rover!!

I've noticed a few Vanagon GL's around town that have nice looking 
factory alloys, metallic paint and lotsa ground clearance (not Syncros).
At what year did VW lower the suspension on these wedges and when did 
they start offering the five hole alloy wheels?  Thanks in advance.
