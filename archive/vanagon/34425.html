Forgot to mention that (part of) the credit for finding my pickup goes
to who else but Thom Fitzpatrick.  I say part because a friend of mine
from Dixon had also called and left the info on my answering machine.
But I did use the printout of Thom's email for the phone number, so he
gets the beer (finder's fee :-).
