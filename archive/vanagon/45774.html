Subject: Lame Events at Local Vw Shop

hey now,

well, i was walking down hillsborough street in raleigh with my friend johnny
and we passed the German Auto Repair Shop on the corner of Dixie and Hillsborou
gh streets. i noticed the owner hosing down the shop bays....no big deal. then
i noticed the runoff going down the culvert and into the drainage system. big
pools of fluorescent green antifreeze. we aren't talking a little leakage. the
guy was pouring the old anti freeze he had collected into the gutters! and
into our water supply eventually.

my friend johnny was extremely pissed as was i...the stuff is poison afterall.
the shop doesn't have a good reputation and i warn everyone i know not to take
their vws there. anyway...johnny took the confrontational approach by telling
the guy what an a#$hole he was and what he was doing was wrong. i would have
taken the educational approach but what was done was done. the guy replied
in english/arabic to mind our own #$cking bizness. johnny said he was
minding his bizness cuz clean drinking water is of upmost concern to him.


today i called the North Carolina Environmental Division, the Wake County
Water Quality offices and several other places. i hope they catch him pouring
more out and shut him down.

folks, let's keep that antifreeze, brake fluid, used oil, etc in the proper
containers until they can be properly disposed of. if ya don't..i'll set
my friend johnny on ya!
