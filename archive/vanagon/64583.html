Subject:      Syncro water proofing

   TO the LIst:

    Does anyone know if the Syncro had anything extra done to the ignition
    to water proof it? I figure if VW took the trouble with the
    air cleaner, maybe they did the same for the ignition system.
    Mine has regular wires and cap etc. Anyone own a Syncro
    from new, that can verify?

                                                                     Eric
