You can use a standard FUEL pump to pump water to your sink, leave the
existing water pump in place. Install the new water pump(fuel pump) in
line, hook up the electric. The new fuel pump can be any 12V from any
vehicle, generic pumps are about $25.00. I installed a pilot light to
let me know when the pump was running (Radio Shack nienty cents).
