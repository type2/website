&gt; Sorry to be so negative, but I have just put in a heck of a day trying to
&gt; add a 3.5&quot; floppy and a hard disk to an IBM PC (the original model 5150),
&gt; and am real turned off at the momment towards trying to get machines to do
&gt; things that were not included in the original design. (anyone need a 
&gt; supply of 3.5&quot; 360K floppies?)

Somehow, an old bus owner trying to keep an old 5150 going seems
appropriate.  I got pretty good mileage out of an old XT (5160) with
a 10M hard drive. Do you take backups to the cassette port? And
no, if I want 3.5&quot; 360's, I'll make them myself! ;-&gt;
