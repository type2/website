Subject: water pump change
Date: Wed, 17 Jul 1996 10:56:32 -0500

I just changed the water pump on the 87 syncro.  A few tips...
1.  Loosen all the belts, don't take them off, just move them out of the
way.
2.  Use two ratchets in opposition to remove the pump pulley bolts, use a
long bolt that will catch somewhere to remove the last bolt.
3.  Upon re assembly, make sure the new pump has the coolant line bolt
holes are machined to the correct depth, or they will feel tight, but
won't seal.  Use washers if necessary
4.  When reassembling pulley,use the long bolt to get the 2 bolts tight,
and then use loctite to hold the third in, as it is difficult to really
tighten.
5.  Check belts carefully before starting up engine!

Hope this is helpful
