&gt;&gt;Dave K. Have you thought of getting info from each of us on engine life
&gt;&gt;and type to verify your data? For example our 82 air-cooled engine was
&gt;&gt;overhauled at 80,0000 miles (previous owner).  DC

Both my 83 westy and my 84 vanagon have not had engine overhauls yet. The 
westy has 60k and is suffering from the popular head gasket problem. It will
need an engine overhaul soon. The 84 vanagon has been lucky so far. It has
logged 100k miles (I probably wrote 10k in another posting) and has no gasket
problem.  Let me know if you like to know anything else about my vanagons.
