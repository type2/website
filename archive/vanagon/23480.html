Subject: More revisions to Westy Tent Pages

Hi all,

I've added some new stuff to the tent pages -- mainly some of John 
Gladu's photos of his carbak camper and a shot of Jack Stafford's tent.  
Check it owwwwwt!

For the carbak: http://www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/nonwesty.html
For Jack's tent: http://www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/drive.html
VW tents: http://www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/tents.html
General VW links: http://www.polaris_dot_net/~jclark/vwpage.html

Visit often - crank up my hit counters!

Disclaimer: I have no tents for sale and don't know where to find any.  
(I've learned from experience to include this statement -- every time I 
announce changes to the pages I get a few requests.  Wish I had a stash 
of 'em, folks. :^)

BTW the new VWOA web page is IMHO promising.  I'm no deadhead, but that 
bustear.jpg cartoon is a definite keeper.  Can't wait to see what they 
put on the history page.

Ever a-lurk,
Joe
