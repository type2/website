Millions of thanks, everyone.

There was *so* much mail in my 'box yesterday (122 postings) 
that it has taken me 3 and a half hours to wade through it.  
How can a thing as simple as a Volkswagen cause so much 
information?

Those hours were well spent.  Keep it up, people.  :)

*** Ennis, Ireland.  A weird place to live.
*** Viva the Bushrats!    ***   Go Dale, #3!
*** If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen.
*** '91 Transporter T4 1.9L diesel SWB van with shiny alloys,
*** a bullbar, Blaupunkt, big Hella spots and a weirdo driver.
