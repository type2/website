Subject: Re: Middle seat in Westy?

I am curious too.  Although I'd rather have the rear facing seat like the
Weekenders had attached to the back of the passenger seat, the middle seat
option would suit me fine.  Indeed if anyone can help me do it soon, I'd
greatly appreciate it.  

I live in Vancouver, WA and can drive a considerable distance to find a
seat...
