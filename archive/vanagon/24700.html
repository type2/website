     ...or should it read, &quot;...don't let your dog drive an automatic.&quot;

&gt;  I'm not sure if I ever posted the story of my friend who found the 
&gt;creampuff '84 westy automatic, with *12,000* original miles !!!!!!!!!! 
&gt;For only $6,000 !!!!
&gt;anyway, horribly, he, his wife, and her parents were driving down the 
&gt;highway, when their super-friendly huge rottweiler climbed into the 
&gt;passenger seat. The dog knocked the van into reverse, which locked up 
&gt;the rear end completely, and rolled the bus 3 times.
&gt;  Thank God, no one was hurt at all. He was the only one wearing a seat 
&gt;belt even. Luckily as well, no other vehicles were involved.
&gt;So, on the bright side, score another super-safety point for vanagons... 
&gt;:(
&gt;And of course the other moral is-don't drive an automatic! 
&gt;:)

As the driver of an '85 automatic, i am wondering: could the transmission be 
shifted into reverse without the button being pressed.  I always thought 
that it could not be shifted higher than neutral without pressing the button
     
??
