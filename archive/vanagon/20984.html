David, et al,

I got my 'misters', foggers or what-ever at Home Depot.  I think they came
five to a baggie.  They were with the stuff for drip irrigation systems.
 They're about the size of a thimble with the push-on fitting coming off the
side allowing you to wire them flat against something.  They dribble a little
until the washer pump builds pressure in the hose then they spray just fine,
sorta like those things markets used to keep the vegetables fresh, back
before god invented air conditioning.  On a hot, dry day if you put one of
these things in front of a fan and feed it water from a tap, it makes a fine
evaporative air cooler (for people, not engines).
