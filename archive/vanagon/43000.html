Subject: RE: control arm bushings for 85 Westy

Gary, I'm replacing the bushings because the eccentric adjuster(washer)is 
rubbing on the outer edge of the bushing itself. The Bentley says that that is 
an indication of bushings worn to their limit. I can also physically move the 
control arm side to side in a horizontal plane. Tom C.
