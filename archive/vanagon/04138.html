Subject: Re: politically correct and you children's silly songs

Joel - your favorites, Big Bopper and Buddy Holly, were killed together
with Richie Valens (of La Bamba fame) in a plane crash on the &quot;day
the music died,&quot; immortalized in a tune called American Pie, sung
by Don MacLean.  Elvis is gone, together with many people from the 
Hit Parade and other stars of novelty television.  Chuck Berry and
Little Richard live one, and hopefully, our vanagons will too!  

I think we all need to start listening to more Snoop Doggy Dog  ;)
