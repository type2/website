Subject: Bug freeze '95

     Hi all you UKers,
     
     Yep its time once again to get on the M6 for a cruuze.
     
     I'll be there in my Samba (you know, January 95 Volksworld) sellin' 
     goodies to bus freaks, or hoverin' round Jon Abbots' bus stall.
     
     Hey, err, if any of you nuts have a mobile, then I'll be switched on  
     0850-672-704, and, err, ask for Lee.
     
     Looking out the window here I think it's gonna be a Bug FREEZE, uurgh.
     
     Lee.
