Subject: Re:  synthetic oil

Synthetics (Mobil-1 at least) have been known to cause rubber seals to 
either swell or shrink in some cars.  In some cases the problem goes
away, in others it just leaks some for the life of the engine.

My SAAB with aircooled turbo, ran for 180k miles on synthetic.  It leaked
some, but not enough to ever add oil between changes.  As some other
list member attested, this car &quot;fell apart&quot; around a strong, perfect running
engine.

I've run Castrol Syntec in my '86 since breakin with no trouble.
(I've also heard that synthetic is too slippery for rings to seat
correctly on a new engine)

 &gt;As far as leaks caused by Synthetic oil, my past history is this: 8 years
 &gt;and 145,000 miles in a 1985 VW Jetta that I used Mobil One in from the first
 &gt;7,500 mile oil change (synthetic oil should not be used for break in oil
 &gt;since it will prevent valves from &quot;seating&quot; properly).  The '85 Jetta
 &gt;disintegrated physically around its perfect engine, never burned oil, only
 &gt;leaked from the valve cover gasket once.  I also used synthetic in my 1992
 &gt;Passat Wagon--this one used oil from the start, but never used any more than
 &gt;1/2 quart in 3,000 miles.  The new owners of this car in Boston have kept in
 &gt;touch with me--now at 65,000 miles, the Passat now seems to use no oil, but
 &gt;leaks slightly from its horizontally mounted distributor--most VW 16V
 &gt;engines seem to leak at this point, though.
 &gt;
 &gt;I suspect that leaks with synthetic oil are anecdotal, the engine protection
 &gt;characteristics of synthetics have sold me on the stuff, though!
