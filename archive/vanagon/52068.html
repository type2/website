&lt;&lt; OK, one last question and I'll go away.  Castrol Syntec only seems to be
 avail. labeled as Dexron-III/Mercon. I want cold weather startups made easy,
 hence the Syntec.   Label says fully compatible with older Dex_II etc. etc.
 What's this Mercon deal, anyone know if this stuff will work OK, if it will
 damage stuff, and if I should really spend $9/qt. instead of $3 for regular
 ATF. Thanks, tim

Mercon has to do with Ford transmissions.  The different fluids are slightly
diffrent viscosities and the dexron uses a slip additive for smoother shifts.
 Newer fluids and especially synthetics are being rated for both
applications.

BTW-Transmission fluid will not make much diffrerence in engine starting.
