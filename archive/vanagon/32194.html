Subject: Bus Safety

We've had quite a few 'problems' in Canada over the last year or so with
semi truck tires flying off and munching unsuspecting drivers-by.  &quot;It can
never happen to me&quot;, I sez, and go about my merry way.  So, I'm driving at
90km/h north towards Goderich, Ontario in the trusty '78 camper, and a
southbound farm 18-wheeler and its tire decide to part company at about the
same time.  Happens too fast to react and WHACK!! - that sickening sound;
right off the front-mounted spare and into the ditch.  &quot;That's gotta hurt&quot; I
say speculatively and pull over.  Amazingly enough, no damage to the van -
it must have hit hit square on the spare and it left without any damage at
all.  Lucky me.  No dents, no scratches, no mess, no fuss.  I'm not
suggesting that the van would have fared well in a head on with a car, but I
was glad to have come out of it so well.  Now, had I been driving the 88
Scirocco . . . it would have been at about windshield level - I don't want
to think about it.

So there's my contribution to the safety debate.

Peace,

        Kev
