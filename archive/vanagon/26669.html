Subject: steering dampner or shock?

Today, while at the Bug-On in Monrovia MD., I picked up a new steering
dampner for my 79.  it wasn't in a box, and wasn't exactly the same as
the old steering dampner, but it fit perfectly and was easy to
install.  So, I go to give the bus a test drive, and the steering is
locked!!!!!! ARGH!!!!!
After barely missing my nextdoor neighbor's new car I stopped.
Swore a whole lot and felt dumb because those next door neighbor's
were in the driveway.
Anyway, obviously-that steering dampner is wrong!  It is NOT a shock 
because 
I just replaced the front shocks with Gabriel gas shocks and they
are much bigger and much heavier.
What's the deal???  The new dampner felt very tight and the old one
moved back and forth easily.
Right now the old one is back on, but I bet that new one(if correct)
would feel great!
Any ideas??
