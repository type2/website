Subject: RE: 6 cyl. Vanagon

I got a copy of the Kennedy Products catalogue a while back, and for 
Vanagons a Subaru 1800cc engine looked like the best choice _at_ 85 - 125 HP. 
No deck mods required, and watercooled. The 90 - 94 2.2l Loyale/Legacy? 
Turbo put out much HP, 160 I think, and required about 2&quot; of extra deck 
height. These were both 4 cyl. engines, some with overhead cam, some with 
pushrods, some with turbo. The RX-7 motor needed more deck height, and was 
rated poor fuel economy. I wonder about the new twin-turbo RX-7. V-6 motors 
were likewise difficult. There was a note about a 6cyl. Subaru engine, ?? 
litres, that showed 230 HP. Wonder were you get one of them, hmmmm. Better 
than twice stock HP and watercooled wow. Price and availability of Subaru 
parts is much better than Porsche motor parts, obviously. The KEP adapter 
plates cost around $450US, you usually needed other bits, ie. flywheel, 
looked like $700+ for the conversion, without any motor! Facing $2500 + 
labour for a new waterboxer core to cure post-nasal drip might make me think 
seriously about the Subaru. Anyone out there with a Subaru Turbo Loyale want 
to provide comments about maintenance and reliability and costs, I'm curious?
