Subject: '71 &amp; '79 Seat Interchangeability

Hi Busheads,

I recently acquired a '71 Westy hardtop from Florida and the seats are a 
bit tattered.  I've been toying with the idea of buying &amp; stripping out a 
'79 passenger van which has some decent high back seats--front middle 
and rear.  I imagine they interchange with the '71, but I am wondering if 
anyone out there in busland knows if this swap will work.  ???   

Thanks in advance!  8-)
