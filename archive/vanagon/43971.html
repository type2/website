Subject: gas tank venting

 Now that my new engine will have Weber carb with a low pressure electric
fuel pump (Redline) Ihave a couple of questions (so far)

what are the venting requirements for the gas tank and /or gas cap?

old hi pressure pump had 2 leads +&amp;- new pump has only one, does + go to
pump and pump body act as ground when fastened to firewall?


Thanks 

Len
