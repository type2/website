&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am new to this list.  I wish I had known it existed a year ago. I have
&gt;a
&gt;&gt; 86 Westy with what seems to be an airflow problem.  I bought the $100
&gt;add-in
&gt;&gt; harness for the air flow meter but it did no good.  I get loss of power
&gt;and
&gt;&gt; black smoke from the exhaust.  If I turn off the key and reset the
&gt;computer
&gt;&gt; while driving, everything goes back to normal for a while.  The problem
&gt;&gt; always returns in 30 seconds to 1 week.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Spraying the connectors with silicon seems to help for a short while. 
&gt;What
&gt;&gt; is my problem?  What measurements can I make?  I don't think that I have
&gt;a
&gt;&gt; problem that others have not encountered.  I saw a reference in another
&gt;post
&gt;&gt; to an air flow problem.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am going on a trip in 10 days, and need your HELP!!!!!!

&gt;Bill,

&gt;I've got a '86 westie with the exact same problem(black smoke and all).  I
&gt;have seen a few posts with almost the same problem. I have been hoping
&gt;someone could point me in the right direction.  I think it is a
&gt;temperature sensor that  is bad because it runs good when cold (first 5
&gt;miles or so).

This sounds an awful lot like a problem I had receintly. My temp head sender
was going out. Caused the same problems. You might try disconnecting it and
clipping one end of your John Muir static timing light to the wire and
connecting the other to ground. If it runs better... bingo!
