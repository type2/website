Subject: Re: &quot;Bird Nest&quot; Air Filter

&gt;Just a hypothetical question...
&gt;
&gt;What would be the effect on performance if the regular air filter in a 73
&gt;Westy was supplemented by an additional  &quot;medium sized bird nest including
&gt;a few baked feathers&quot; filter, underneath the pleated paper filter.
&gt;
&gt;Was this a factory option, or was it more likely to have been installed by
&gt;the dealer?   Can I still get parts (twigs, wool) or will I have to replace
&gt;the entire &quot;bird nest&quot; as an assembly?


You're lucky this is a'73. On later models these were replaced with a 
computerised tangle of wires and diodes. It doesn't do a significantly 
better job of bunging up the filter, but it is a sealed-for-life unit, costs 
a king's ransom (only available from authorised dealers), has umpteen 
mystifying connectors and is guaranteed to fail with annoying regularity.
