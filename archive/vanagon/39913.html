Tom,

There are some differences between '65 and '66  that are immediately 
noticeable.  The most obvious is the engine decklid and rear apron.  
The '65 has the &quot;church-key&quot; type while the '66 (and '67 has the 
&quot;finger-pull&quot; latch type.  The rear view mirror also changed between 
'65 &amp; '66.

The other one I can think of off the top of my head is the wiper 
motor.  The '65 has a seperate wiper motor with linkages going to the 
wiper shafts.  The '66 has a one piece unit that has the motor, 
linkages, and wiper shafts all together.

I do have chassis number information that I have not formatted yet to 
go on the NEATO Technical Data Page (along with a ton of other stuff!).
I will try to get it up sometime this week (plus the Links Page).

&gt;&gt;Easiest if you check out the NEATO web site - it contains info on datind and
&gt;&gt;deciphering plates and also has paint codes M nos model nos ..and a whole
&gt;&gt;bunch of intersting stuff. 
&gt;
&gt;Dave is talking about http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html
&gt;I had used that site to decode the optional equipment and paint codes,
&gt;and to confirm that the first three digits of the VIN indicated it was
&gt;a Standard Microbus, RH Cargo Doors, LH Drive, so a big thanks to Dave 
&gt;Easterwood and the rest of NEATO. But there is no build sequence or
&gt;year of manufacture data. 
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, your eyes are all glazing over and I still don't know the year of the subject 
&gt;bus. I think its not a '64 because it has the later VIN format, and not a '67
&gt;because it has the square key lock on the gas filler. So '65 or '66. Maybe the family 
&gt;will find the paperwork, and solve the mystery, or next time I visit, I'll check
&gt;the engine number and the rear deck lid lift.
