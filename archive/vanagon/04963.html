So Mike Busby says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have not had much luck in trying to find the leak.  I was wondering
&gt; if the oil filter had been damaged because of the pressure.  When the
&gt; oil was re-drained, it came out like a high-pressure hose.  Anyone
&gt; have a comment on what could be causing the leak?
&gt; 

Well, it seems to me that there are a couple of possibilities.  Either
the leak is coming from a broken seal or gasket, or there may be some
residual oil that is puddled somewhere and is still dripping down and
onto the ground.  I would check for tell-tale signs by laying under 
the car where the drips are landing and look up to see if you can follow
the oil trail.  I would check the oil pan, all of the components that
are bolt on with a gasket such as the fuel pump, oil pump, oil filter
holder etc.  I would also check where the crankshaft pulley connects
onto the crank (seal).  If you could put the car up on ramps and run
the engine while you lay down underneath, I'm sure you could locate
where the leak is coming from.  I agree though with checking the spin
on filter first.  Especially since the kids who did it were suspect.

Good Luck,

Steven
