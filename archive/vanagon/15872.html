Subject: Re: Franklin Mint Microbus

Not Stupid, not Dedicated but saw one at Phoenix Bug-o-Rama. Some kid had it
out ther for a look at me kinda thing. It does look very nice, about the
size of the old car models that I put together as a kid for $2.00 a pop.
Everything moves opens and rolls as it should. The only thing missing is
that the gas heater is the only way to heat the thing by the time you get
the bus to where you're going ;). It's the nicest $150.00+ toy that I saw at
Bug-O-Rama. I am not a &quot;toy&quot; kinda guy. Most of that **Personally** no
flames please- leaves me cold. I like tinkering with the real poop.

 
&gt;
&gt;anyhoo, was anybody stupi ... er, Dedicated (yeah, that's it!) enough to
&gt;buy this thing? :)  i'm kinda curious as to the quality/etc.
&gt;
&gt;not that i would buy it, mind you. not at that price, anyway. just curious.
