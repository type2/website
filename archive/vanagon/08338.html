Johnny:

My guess is that there is something wrong with the master cylinder you 
replaced.  Years ago, in my 1981 Dasher Diesel, I talked a machine shop 
into rebuilding a brake master cylinder.  VW recommends against this, 
incidentally.

When I reiinstalled the rebuilt item, refilled and bled the brakes and 
tried to drive the car, the brakes would be fine until I tried to use 
them, and they would work, but the pedal would not return from the floor 
and in fact the brake pressure would increase until the car just would 
not move.  The brakes were self applying themselves.

Perhaps you have a defective &quot;new&quot; master cylinder. --
