The kids call 'em &quot;poots&quot; - seems to work best in mixed social situations.

However, they call MINE (after a night of homebrew and Bentley-reading) FARTS.

'Spose they're right, but it still bothers me. I prefer &quot;poots&quot;, too!

Remember Toad's motorcar? &quot;Poot-poot-poot...&quot; Cracks the kids up every time.
