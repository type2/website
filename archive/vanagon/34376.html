&gt;Hi Justin,
&gt;   Was reading your post questions about diesels and thought I might add my
&gt;$0.02 worth.
&gt;   First, yes, Vanagon diesels are just like a rabbit diesel, most of the
&gt;parts are interchangeable.  They came with a 1.6L and were offer from
&gt;'81-'83. In 83 you could get a vanagon with an air-cooled motor, diesel or
&gt;the new water-cooled flat-4 1.9L engine. Yes, they are slow, the engine
&gt;only produces 48hp. The trans is geared much like a split window bus.  But
&gt;they get great fuel mileage, average about 30mpg. Most parts are still
&gt;available, and are not to expensive.
&gt;    When I bought my Westy diesel the engine was shot. The bearings had
&gt;worn out do to antifreeze in the oil and lack of oil pressure.  I had the
&gt;choice of either rebuilding the diesel, with new crank and rods to match,
&gt;or replaced the diesel with a used gas rabbit motor.  I went with the gas
&gt;motor. It was cheaper, and at the time I didn't have a lot of time to do a
&gt;complete overhaul. Besides, I heard that it could be done and I'm a sucker
&gt;for trying new things. So far the motor has been great. Right now I having
&gt;problems with the fuel injection. But baring that I think that the gas
&gt;motor has been a good choice. Anyway, the diesel, is a good motor, maybe
&gt;slow but it's reliablity and relatively cheap to maintain makes it a good
&gt;choice in my opinon.  If you do decide to get a diesel vanagon you could
&gt;always do a gas transplant. In line-4 water cooled motors are quite
&gt;plentiful in the salvage yards. I hope this answers your questions.  Good
&gt;luck finding one.
&gt;

Hello Jim,
Did you convert the fuel system over to that of a gas vehicle or are you
driving an improperly vented,  non vapor revcovery,  emmision illegal time
bomb. Although I see the benifits of this conversion, this last step should
not be over looked.  Just thought I'd enter some fuel for thought.
Keep on Bussin'
