Subject: Duh, i don't have a 1700 engine


hey now,

late yesterday, sean got the heads and cooling tin back from being 
cleaned. the tin had been acid soaked..i don't know about the heads but 
they look brand new clean. they are being sent off to california to be 
machined and reworked. much better job and quality and price then we can 
get here in nc.  also will be guaranteed not to drop a valve seat or they 
will pay for repairs.

anyways, sean really looked at the heads last night...i have a 1800 engine.
the heads are larger and more oval shaped then a 1700's heads. duh. so we 
have to return the p&amp;c set we found yesterday. sean confirmed the size by 
measuring the pistons i reckon. duh. hehehe.
