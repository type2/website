So Joel Walker says:

&gt; ok, NOBODY voiced negative opinions about this Who's Where stuff, so here
&gt; goes ... what i would LIKE to have is your location as the largest major
&gt; city within 100 miles (150 km) of your &quot;real&quot; location ... i figure that
&gt; all the folks around a big city (like san francisco) might get together
&gt; for something like, say, pizza and beer?? :) and that distance is not tooooo
&gt; far to drive for such tomfoolery. so if you'd like me to change what i have,
&gt; let me know.

Bravo Joel!  

Too bad there's not enough room for a email listing column.  &lt;sheepish grin here&gt;

;)
