Subject:  Roof racks for 76 Type II? 

Anyone have any reccomendation on what kind of roof racks will fit a
76 Type II non camper. I want to put a couple of windsurfers up there.

PS: If you are selling something, or a vehicle its worth mentioning
    where you are. It is often difucult to tell what continent a post 
    comes from, let alone whether it is close enough to bother following up.
