Subject: spring PNW camping

i'll try again this year...

anyone in the PNW interested in a little weekend gathering?
I have a couple of dates/spots in mind, which correspond to other activity:

3/15 Deception Pass State Park - mtb ride with BBTC folks;
4/5 Orcas Island/Mt Constitution - mtb ride with BBTC folks;
(BBTC == Backcountry Bicycle Trail Club)

as for other spots:
out at Pt Townsend or Marrowstone Island;
maybe some nicer 3-day weekend down in Cannon Beach, Oregon vicinity;
any other ideas on west side of mountains within 4-5 hours of Seattle area?
