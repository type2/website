&gt;So... are you saying this shouldn't be tried at the next Vanagon camping

come on, folks ... Steve is NOT kidding about this stuff. it is HIGHLY
dangerous. it CANNOT be stopped once you start the reaction. you can't throw
water on it, it works underwater, fire extinguishers don't work, sand and
dirt don't stop it ... it will melt whatever gets in its way until the
reaction exhausts all of its chemical energy.  it is MUCH more dangerous than
fireworks or gasoline or even guns!!

those of us who have been in the military and seen what this stuff will do
are trying to scare the rest of you aware from even trying this. it is NOT
something to play with. it can KILL you, and if it doesn't, it can inflict
terrible pain ... just little particles being sprayed outward from the
reaction will try to melt their way through YOU (or your car, cat, dog, house,
concrete driveway, etc.).

the military uses this stuff to destroy things they do not want other people
to have ... and it is VERY effective at that destruction. VERY VERY effective.
it will melt through entire truck engines, through the huge metal barrels of
the artillery canons, or even through the hull of a ship. it will melt its
way through concrete or steel or anything else that gets in its way. it is
NOT something to play with.

please don't try to make this stuff.  it is NOT safe. you would be safer
running around in a thunderstorm, waving a 30-foot aluminum pole.
