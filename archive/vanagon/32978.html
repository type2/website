Subject: BBC vanagon spotted


Just wandered past Coventry Cathedral, where there was some special
`service of thanksgiving for 100 years of the British motorcar'. Apart 
from the Jag E-types, Singers, Triumphs, Rudges etc etc were all the BBC
vehicles there to cover the event. They had three VWs. A couple of LT34s(?)
and a gold vanagon, with the BBC logo on the side. The vanagon had gold,
mirrior type tinting on all the windows except the front, so you couldn't
see in, and an enourmous telescopic arial mounted on the roof. Judging
by how low this thing sat it was fully of equipment, but it drove away 
before I could get a really good look. Despite the description of the 
colour scheme, it actually looked quite good, although all the roof
mounted ironmongery mad it look like a large R/C model.
