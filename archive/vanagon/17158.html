Subject: Re: Anyone know where water tank plug can be found?

&gt;Assuming that this is an American model, a regular hose cap should fit 
&gt;perfectly, as long as it is the right diameter...  I know this only because 
&gt;mine was unscrewed during shipment and fell off during delivery.  I discovered 
&gt;that in order to replace it, at that time, I would have had to replace the 
&gt;whole sink drain assembly (really stupid situation) in order to get just that 
&gt;plug.  I went down to the local H/W store and got a cap that fit perfectly and 
&gt;voile'...

I don't think that the original poster was thinking about the sink drain...
I believe he was looking for a water tank cap.  For the sink drain, I've
heard that the cap from a Chlorox bottle will work.  (I haven't tried it,
though.)
