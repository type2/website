Hi Harvey,

Yes,
I was extremely optimistic -- did not get a chance to lookup
efficiency numbers -- that's why I emphasized the MORE THAN
clause...  It would be kind of nice to have a second 150 Amp
alternator put in, though :-) (do they even make these things???)

 &gt; Cetin - Very valid point, except :  your numbers are at 100% conversion
 &gt; efficiency.  The real world won't allow that - probably better add at least
 &gt; 20% to your numbers!
