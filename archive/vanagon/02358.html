&gt; I think it's Somebody's Theory that if you make a chain from person
&gt; X to person Y in the USA by FOAFOAFOAFOAF...  then actually you can
&gt; always connect any two people by a chain no longer than:
&gt; FOAFOAFOAF
&gt; 
&gt; The nice thing about this theory is that there's no proving it (or
&gt; disproving it) so you can believe it as part of the growing VW
&gt; True Faith and Mystic Revelation Cult that seems to be springing up....

Don't know if this applies but...this has been studied.  In a 
university somewhere.  I think it was sociologists.  They determined 
that if you took any two people in the country, at random, there are 
only five people between as friends.  This was an average.  I think it 
has been duplicated.  In other words, anyone of you could give me the 
name of someone you work with and I would ask a friend who has a 
connection to that city who might ask a friend who had the same line 
of work, etc. until someone knew that person.  It only takes five.  
Within the VW community I bet we could average less.  :)  I knew all 
that college would come in handy.  I'm also kinda fun at parties after
a few drinks.
