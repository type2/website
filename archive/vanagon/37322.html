Subject: Re: [T2] Ponderous motor thoughts...

&gt; I saw an ad for a 1.7 L Porsche 914 motor and was wondering if this would
&gt; fit in my '79 Bust.  If it would fit, is it a bolt up, plug in the Bus FI
&gt; stuff and go job or something worse.

Was waiting for someone else to point out...
The 4 cylinder 914 engine is a basically VW engine that was installed in 
411, 412 and buses starting in '72.  Size kept growing.  Added water 
jacket after a couple years in a Vanagon.  Dealers would hype the fact 
that it was a Porsche engine because it was in a Porsche 914.  In Europe 
the 914/4 was a VW and the 914/6 was a Porsche (close enough)  We had a 
'72 camper and the dealer fed the Porsche line to my dad when he needed 
to replace a prematurely dead '69 (hit by an early Civic - never have 
like Hondas)

Ignore the Porsche part.  I don't know how big the engine had gotten by 
'79 but suspect it was bigger than 1700 cc which I think was used in '72 
or '73.  Judge this engine as a VW engine that is better or worse than 
what you got now.
