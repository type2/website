&gt;
&gt;I have a '65 split window, original paint, original interior (excpt
&gt;uplstry), only a little rust (under the battery), with a '71  1600 SP,
&gt;original leaking trans, original leaking weather stripping. It sounds
&gt;pretty desperate but it runs well and looks pretty nice too.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice or philosophical discourse (to drive or not to drive) (to
&gt;restore or not to restore)  would be greatly welcomed.


my policy has always been to preserve *and* drive the vehicle. I often run
into the dreaded cash flow problem, and i can't always restore my vehicles
to the pristine condition i would like. I try and at least keep the rust
from getting any worse by repairing any obvious rust holes, and dealing
with the surface rust.

I think (assuming emotional attachment hasn't already been established)
that you should look at the oriiginality and/or rarity of the vehicle and
decided how much $$$$$$ you want to sink into it. Obviously itis cheaper to
do the work yourself assuming you know how. Actually a cheap temporary fix
for your bus would be to keep it stored in a well vetilated garage. That
will keep rainwater from making your rust any worse (i.e. the rust under
the windshied etc.) I would fix the rust time/money permitting, that is the
way i do at least.
