Subject: Re: Fuel Injector Cleaner

For many years Techron was the only additive of any kind that BMW,
Porsche, and Mercedes would reccommend...

	One &quot;Cleaner&quot; that I personally like is a Lubro Moly product called
Ventil Sauber (Valve Cleaner??)this is a solvent added to gas tank when
there is less than two or so gals in it...it cleans/removes the carbon
deposits off the backsides of the intake valves... Good Stuff..
	Lubro Moly also makes a Heavy Duty injection cleaner, but I've had
problems finding a supplier for that locally

	Lubro Moly products are what VW used to recommend for Dealer shop use (
a few years ago, haven't worked for one since '89 or so...)

	I believe there is a vendor or two running Ads in European Car  that
have a package deal ( both products for like $15-$18...)
