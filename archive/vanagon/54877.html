Hi all -
Recent heavy snow storm in the Sierra's dumped lots of snow in a short 
period of time.  On the order of 2 feet overnight.  1 inch per hour 
stuff throught he day.  Local news station happened to be there when 
the road crews pulled a dark colored Vanagon out of an avalanche.  

Apparently a small avalanche came across the Interstate to a depth of 
about 5 feet deep.  The winds whipped up and driver ended up in a 
white out.  Drove right into the avalance.  Oops.  Apparently the bus 
and driver came out ok.

Another VW sighting.  On a recent rerun of Nash Bridges, the one 
where they are searching for a Pinto belonging to baseball player, 
the get into the wrecking yard holding the Pinto by climbing over the 
fence aided by a splitty used as a ladder.
