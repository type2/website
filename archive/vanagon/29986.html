&gt;that the Vanagons are actually quite good in the snow.  Your
&gt;opinions?

&gt;brian.

The first winter I had my '84 Vanagon I got to January with
the stock Continental &quot;Transporters&quot; tires on it.  By the
end of January I bought two wheels and two snow tires.  This
was my 5th Type 2 and I had never had problems in the snow
before.  I found that with so much distribution of weight to
the front, the front tires would settle in the snow and the
rear tires would not push me.

After the original tires wore out, I bought four new
Continental M/S tires and have not had a problem since then.
As long as you have some rear tires with good traction, the
rest is easy.
