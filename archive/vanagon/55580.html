Subject:  Re: VW Alloy Wheels

&gt;&gt;Everybody, keep in mind that Cory's talking about mounting a &quot;Carat&quot; V-gon
&gt;&gt;wheel, not a Audi turbo wheel. 
&gt;&gt;Also, I would imagine, if one was to purchase a set of used Vanagon &quot;Carat&quot;
&gt;&gt;style 5 spoke alloys, they would be smart enough to get the lug nuts and bolts
&gt;&gt;too, therefore your problem would be solved......
&gt;&gt;
&gt;When I bought my 87 syncro a couple of years ago I also picked up a set of
&gt;Carat alloy wheels. I DID NOT have to replace any of the studs to mount the
&gt;alloy wheels.. 

Yeah,come to think of it, I seemed to have missed when Cory said &quot;longer studs
in the rear&quot; which of course, isn't necessary.  (forgive me, It was late...)
Just as you said, there is no modification to the rear studs to mount the
factory &quot;Carat&quot; alloy wheels. You just use the alloy wheel lug nuts and bolts,
and you're ready to roll. 

when you mount the Audi turbo wheels, that is when you need longer studs in the
rear drums.

(I think people get the hang of this now....   :&lt;)
