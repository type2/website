Subject: '84 sink

I was lucky enough to buy a gorgeous '84 Westy with 49,000 original miles
on it from an old guy three years ago. Only problem: The sink/faucet wasn't
working, and I quickly made it worse.

The connection under the knob wasn't making proper contact to get the pump
going and I stupidly spun the knob well past where it should have stopped
before I realized the problem. Result: I snapped off the small, black,
plastic peg that is supposed to restrict how far the knob turns. Now it
spins out of control and strips the wires off the connections each time. I
tried epoxying the peg back in place, but that was dumber than my original
mistake.

Do I need to replace the whole faucet or has someone out there accomplished
the fix in some other way?

Thanks,
--BW--
