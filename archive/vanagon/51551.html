&gt; 
&gt; What's the chances of the heads just needing re-torquing?

   Waste of time.

 Is this common at 102,000 
&gt; miles? Also, how about different types of stop-leak?
    Warning!!!!!!
    It will cause other problem in a Vanagon!

    Will clog up the heater cores and the Rad. cap!


 Anyone have any experience with 
&gt; thems stopping VW Camper head-gasket leaks? If so which type? I've seen metallic aluminum 
&gt; (dry) types, liquid types, etc. Since the type of anti-freeze you use is so
 important to these aluminum head engines, I'd think the wrong type of stop-leak could also damage the

 Regular prestone Anti-freeze is fine in a Vanagon! It's the water that
 is mixed with it that causes the problem! Here in the US most Water
  supplies are not a problem at all.

 
&gt; heads?
