Hi there,
	Well, my bus isn't running so great right now either.  You
said....

&gt;A note regarding your auto choke. You would know if your auto choke was
&gt;stuck closed, becuase your car would idle at an extremely fast rate at
&gt;startup, and not die down.

I see this.  After it idles high for a bit I have to nudge the gas
peddle a bit to get the idle to go down to normal.  Is this nudge
thing consistent with a stuck auto-choke?  I didn't think it
was too bad, but lately after stopping it from idleing so fast, it
idles very poorly for a minute or so then kind of evens out.  If I
don't let the bus idle for 10/15 minutes it is almost undrivable.  

I have a weber carb, anyone wanna tell me what to look for when I am
looking for the auto-choke.  Could someone tell me the name of the
Weber carb book?  Thanks everyone:)

have a good weekend,
		brandy
