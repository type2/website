Subject: Re: Things that make you go &quot;Hmmmm&quot;

&gt; As a novice that has been looking hard for a Westy, I appreciate your  
&gt; info on things to be carefull of when looking at a bus.  If any more  
&gt; &quot;potential pittfalls&quot; come to mind, I would sure appreciate hearing  
&gt; them.  Rust is my biggest concern.  

Always check for rust in the following areas: 

Windsheild face (strip of body that supports wipers) ALL VW'S
...Major hassle to patch and repair. usually worse under the gasket!
...Splitties are susceptible to cancer around the window center frame!

Around headlight trim ALL VW'S
...The trim sometimes hides serious rust gremlins. After facing the
...hassle of rebuilding my headlight adjustment bracket, and welding
...in a new trim ring bolt I now know to check...

Fresh Air Duct (grilled panel below windsheild face) 68-78 BUSSES
...Not an easy fix either, potential for some nasty winter drafts!

Floorboards..in general. ALL VW'S
...replacement is not too bad, but tin usually is a bit short and is hard
...to make up in the corners and the bend regions by the wheel arch. 
...Check carefully by the gas pedal.._dot_common rust area
...Check also by the shifter plate/cup..another potential rust region

Area by seatbelt bolt(bottom)
...Where the seatbelt bolts to the wheel arch. another common area
...susceptible to cancer. Not a fun moment feeling your seatbelt ...giveway
at the wrong moment!

Sliding Door track (upper &amp; lower) most BUSSES
...A most critical area as I've seen (and had) Kamakazi Doors that just
.._dot_decided to &quot;let-go&quot; as I went around a corner, and went sidewalk
...surfing down the road.  Hard on the glass, and scares hell out of both
...rear passengers and pedestrians alike. Look for rusted out track, or a
...concentration of rust bubbles specifically on the lower track by either
...corner.  THIS IS A TRUE PAIN to repair....

Rocker Panel/Cargo Doors: Pre68 BUSSES
...Similiar to the Sliding door track above.  NOTE: All doors are suspect
...until proven rust free. Check for rusted areas at the bottom (gravity)
...of the door(s), by the hinges, and around the windowsill/gasket areas!

Middle and Rear FloorBed/Pan
...Usually more pronounced around the perimeter of the bus I have
...noticed areas like the inlet for the AC resevoir, the utility panel inlet,
...and in the passenger corner where the Westie closet sits. I gather that
...moisture congregates here and causes eventual deterioration...

WINDOWS: All
...Maybe it's just me, but does anybody else have a problem with the
...wingvent windows on the side and rear windows (72 bus)? Mine are
...rusting/bubbling directly under the hingepin for the quartervent. ...I've
replaced my sliding door window with a jalosie model and plan
...to do the same with the opposite side, but imagine others must be
...having the same experiance as most of the junked busses I find have
...the same rust booboo's?

Spare Wheel Well: 68-? BUSSES
... Bottom on mine rusted out from a leak caused by the quarter 
... window problem I noted above.  Seeing's how I mount my spare
... on the nose, I removed this section, sheetmetaled it over, built a
...small toolbox area above and respostioned my battery into the sub-
...sequient space directly below. Eventually, after I replace the battery
...tray on the passenger side, I will mount my EberSparcher in this new
.._dot_cavity and hopefully not freeze to death next winter ; )...

Battery Tray.... ALL VW's
...Need I say more?

&gt;Also I haven't decided if I want  to go pre or post '72.  

Get `em both Bart !
