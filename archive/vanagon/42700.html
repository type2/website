&gt; hatch seal for my 73 westy. Is there any secret concerning the installation ?
&gt; I suppose I just pull out the old and put in the new ? Any glue involved?
&gt; Anything else I need to get to tackle this ?

I used 3M weldwood cement.  It holds in in well, but if you even needed to 
get it out, you could, with effort.  The 3M weatherstrip adhesive is 
stronger, but you would probably have to cut the frame to get the seal
back out :) (just kidding)
