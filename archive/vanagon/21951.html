Subject: looking for a camper

All,

I am looking for a camper, pre vanagon era(not that I have anything
against Vanagons, I just don't want one).  I need the body/pan to be
in good condition, condition of motor(or lack thereof) is not that
important, nor is the condition of the interior(I only ask that the
components be there, and in a condition that can be fixed, rather than
pitched), it needs to be within reasonable distance of Austin,Texas
(3/4 of a day drive- 1 day drive), and can be towed(I don't want to
purchase tires, just to get it home, and (as if that wasn't enough) it
needs to be cheap, I could probably weasle $700 out of the wife, but
I would have to pay for it later :-O

Any leads would be appreciated.

BTW, I am looking for a pop-top camper, not a weekender version.

Thanks

David
