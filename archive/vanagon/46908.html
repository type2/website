So Gerald Skerbitz says:
&gt; I've added a nice description of head gasket replacment by Herb Harmison
&gt; &lt;herbh_at_iastate_dot_edu&gt; to the Vanagon Files location on the gopher as
&gt; 
&gt;    HOW-TO---Head-Gasket-Replacement
&gt; 
&gt; gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon/Files

I skimmed that article and noticed a reference to another article
about bleeding the system called &quot;Bubble Trouble&quot;.  Does anyone out
that have a copy of that?
