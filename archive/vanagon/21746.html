Subject: Where to get rebuilt Tranny?

Hey now,
        The Crunchings and Munchings have returned, telling me my tranny is
not long for this world. Anyone got some good inexpensive sources for
rebuilts for a '70 transporter? Somewhere near Austin is best, but mail
order is cool if the price is right.

Peace,
