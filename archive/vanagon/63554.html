Subject: Re: shocks, and life

Digest is horrible because you have to scroll through the whole thing.

Better to use an email program like Eudora that will organize all posts by
subject (group same subject posts together alphabetically.) You delete all
the posts with subjects that don't interest you and then read only the good
stuff.

Much, MUCH better than digest for getting through the mail quickly.

&gt;Good Morning Derek.
&gt;
&gt;I have to apologize to someone, and since you picked up my ball and completed
&gt;the play for me, it might as well be you.  I have intended to follow up on
&gt;Thomas Niksche's report when he sent it to me, but... well, air conditioning
&gt;installation, walk in closet work for my 16 month old Tersa, blown up furnace
&gt;fans,..... etc. etc.  you know ..  LIFE... kinda interferred.  I did just fax
&gt;a note to both Peter Seikel and Projektzwo this morning, just before I read my
&gt;e-mail.
&gt;
&gt;When I started the whole Better Shock Question, who could know where it would
&gt;lead, and now there is news and prices for parts avaiolable in Germany.
&gt;
&gt;My thanks for contacting Peter Seikel.  I got the news of the 3 parts
&gt;available in Germany from Thomas while the list was down.  I did not realize
&gt;he had spread the news a bit farther, and I thank you for following up on it. 

OK. How about you pursue the Projecctwzo people the way I did Seikel. Let's
see what dope you can get.

&gt;I read you report in todays list.  I get it as a digest.  Methinks I should
&gt;switch to regular, maybe I'd get the news a bit faster.  
&gt;
&gt;I too am very interested in what can be obtained for better shocks, and maybe
&gt;springs.  We should try to identify how the rears compare to the Bilsteins
&gt;that are available.  I believe the Bilstein rears are a bit less expensive.
&gt;
&gt;I also have in a short archive, the names and e-mail address of at least
&gt;another dozen who expressed an interest when I started my search.
&gt;
&gt;At this point, I wonder if we should try to get someone like Ron Salmon of the
&gt;Bus Depot involved.  He might have contacts and be familiar with the process
&gt;of how to get stuff from overseas.  But Maybe you have done that before and we
&gt;don't need another middle man.

Ron seems to keep his slice of the middle to a modest role so it is not that
onerous, usually. But I usually just call Germany at 8 in the morning here,
credit card in hand.  It is the discount thing that we have yet to crack in
Europe--German dealer willing to ship to USA on a Visa card number, and at
discount, and to correspond via email.

&gt;I'd like to hear your opinion.
