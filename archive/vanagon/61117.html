&gt; Anyone know what interval you are suppost to change the tranny fluid in a
&gt;  90 vanagon with automatic transmission?
&gt;  
&gt;  I can't find any reference to frequency of ATF change in my owners manual
&gt;  or Bentley.  

Although I waited much longer to change mine (like 100,000 miles - please no
flames) I'd suggest about every 50,000 miles.

&gt;I also can't find any info in Bentley as to how to go about it.  

I thought there were some general instructions in there.  Basically, do this:
1. Buy a new filter(really just a screen) and seal and ATF.
2. In a clean, level place (perhaps put a plastic tarp under the van)
    detach the tube from the side of the pan &amp; drain the ATF
    remove the pan, being careful to  note which way the filter (screen)
    is installed.  KEEP EVERYTHING AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE.  Even bits of 
    lint can be detrimental inside an automatic transmission.
3. Install new filter screen and seal, reinstall the pan.
4. Add new ATF to the full mark with the trans warm, engine running.  Hey
now, I remember reading this in the Bentley.  Look more carefully.  You're
not talking abouth the owners manual are you.  By &quot;Bentley&quot; you do mean the
1.5&quot; thick big green book, right?

&gt;Is there a filter to change?  Does the pan have to be dropped?  

See above.

&gt;There is no drain plug, right?

No.  Drain it through the tube connection.

Since I waited toooo long to change mine I did a bit of a &quot;pre-procedure&quot;
before the 
&quot;regular&quot; ATF change:

My ATF had not been changed in a long while and I wanted to
change as much of it as possible.  Since a significant ammount of ATF remains
in the trans during this procedure, I elected to change much of the ATF
before the procedure.  What I did was use a plastic lube oil pump and snaked
plastic tubing down the dipstick tube and pump out 1 quart.  Then add 1
quart.  We'd drive it for another week or three and replace another quart.  I
think I replaced about 6 quarts this way.  I recall calculating that I was
able to replace about 95% of the old ATF after the screen &amp; gasket change
with new ATF.  If I recall correctly, a typical change only replaces about
60% of the ATF.  If yours hasn't been serviced regularly, you might want to
to the same.  Remember to do any of this work in the most clean conditions
possible - ATs are very suseptible to even small amounts of dirt or even
lint.

Good luck,
