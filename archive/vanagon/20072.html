NO!!!  Most brass polishes contain varnishes to help keep that fresh 
clean look.  Said varnishes are notoriously poor conductors.

Yes, make them shiny.  Use a stiff brush, vinegar and salt, or a fine 
file.  Don't use emery paper -- most contain an oil lubricant, which is 
also less than perfectly conductive, and also keeps crud from 
dispersing.

YMMV, o'course, and I'm not a metallurgist, nor do I play one on TV.
