Subject: external head leak
Date: Wed, 28 May 1997 09:30:56 -0400

Like most other Vanagons at some time in their lives, my '91 is =
suffering from external head leaks.  Mine only leaks in the winter =
though..  The last two years, as soon as the temps stay 40 or above, the =
leaking stops.  I had to fill up the reservoir every two weeks or so =
during the winter.

I'm just curious if anyone else found this to be the case.  Maybe it =
gets worse as time goes on.  Any feelings on how quickly the leaks go =
from being tolerable to intolerable?  I know different people have =
different thresholds.  I don't want to poison all the neighborhood cats =
and dogs, but I also don't want to spend $2000.   It has 80k miles on =
it.

I've been a VW addict for the last 13 years or so, but I'd have to say =
that my other VWs (Rabbit, Jetta II, and Cabriolet) have been way more =
bullet proof than the Vanagon.  I don't mind replacing worn out parts =
like shocks, tie rods, ball joints, even cv joints, etc, since I can do =
them myself.  I resent this head leak, though, since it's a known =
Vanagon problem, very expensive to have someone fix, and  somewhat over =
my head (no pun intended) to repair myself (and still expensive if I =
need new heads).  I guess I'll have to try fighting with VWoA on this.  =
I know people have had mixed results with this.

I've been on the list for a couple of months and have enjoyed it.  This =
is my first entry.  Thanks for any info (or sympathy or whatever),=20
