Subject:      FLAPS ... an afterthought

which brings up a thought on this FLAPS thing:

sometimes it's hard for us old-timers to recall that we made up this junk
or already know that it means, etc. and that new folks are signing on each
week that do NOT know what the heck we are talking about.

so you newer folks need to kick us in the butt every now and then and say,
HEY! What does that Mean?

kinda like when you take a new job somewhere, and you have to ask where the
toilets are; stuff like that.

and while we are at it, since not everbody has access to gopher software,
if anybody wants the fuel injection data (from bosch) for their bus, or the
model year differences in the buses, or the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions
... a misnomer for just general collected info) or Some-Parts-Suppliers, or
even the file about the stuff i've done to my buses over the years :) ...
just ask and i can/will/be happy? to send it to you.   not exactly 'pimping'
here, but if you are bored today, it makes dull reading. ;)
