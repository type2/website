I take issue with the following statement from WHellmer_at_aol_dot_com:

&gt; the change in magnetic strength in your alternator
&gt; does not dissipate horsepower from the engine or produce 
&gt; signifigant additional &quot;drag&quot; as some seem to believe. it is 
&gt; important to understand how a bosch alternator functions in 
&gt; order to further explain.

The force on a current carrying wire in a magnetic field is proportional
to both the magnetic field and the current.  I.e. you increase the torque
of the alternator by drawing more current or by increasing the field.  Adding
a load to the alternator increases both.  When the current draw is higher
you need more force to push the wire through the field and this force must
come from the engine, slowing it down.

&gt; 2. how a bosch alternator works:
&gt; [ generally correct description removed to save space ]

OK, this is almost exactly how the large generators at your neighborhood
nuclear power plant work.  If what you say is true, if we could get that
thing spinning with my 2.0L VW engine, adding the city of Chicago to the 
output wouldn't significantly load down the engine.  I think I better call
the DOE!

&gt; now back to the point. the mechanical energy consumed by the rotation of the
&gt; alternator does not increase as electrical output increases. your engine
&gt; cannot tell if the alt is outputting 20 amps or
&gt; 55 amps. now for those of you theorists who are waiting to drop the
&gt; &quot;increased resistance to rotation as a result of induction&quot; bomb,
&gt; this effect would be similar to lightly rubbing your finger against the fan
&gt; pully and would definately not be measured in horsepower;
&gt; inch-ounces perhaps :)

Lets see:  20A * 12V is 240 Watts which is nearly 1/3 horsepower.  At 60A,
you get nearly one horsepower.  So, neglecting inefficiencies in your
alternator, you would need 2/3 hp from your engine to get 40 more amps for
your stereo.  You do agree that the energy has to come from somewhere, right?
And, since the alternator isn't all that efficient, it probably is more 
like 1.5 or 2 hp.

If anyone is not clear on the above, please don't hesitate to ask.  I'm
pretty confident in my EM theories.  Generally, or alternately ;-)

Albrecht
