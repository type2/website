Subject: Strange tab behind passenger's seat
Date: Fri, 13 Oct 1995 18:21:27 -0500 (CDT)

Can anyone tell me what the tab on the back of the base
of the passenger's side seat in my '79 westy is?  It's
located on the back face of the base and is a tab about
the size of a seatbelt clasp and it's simply bolted in
there.  What in the world is this for?  No one I've 
talked to has even a guess.  I thought it might be for
some sort of cargo strap, but there isn't a matching one
anywere else in the bus.
