Subject:       50's White-walls?

Greetings!

Since Friday has arrived, and I find myself looking at the postcard 
with the 21-window on my wall, I can't help want some of those big 
old white-walls.

Does anyone have any information on them.  I talked to the local VW 
guru sometime ago, and he said something like $100/ea!  Ack!

Is anyone running them on their &quot;resto classo&quot; ;-) ?

What source should I look to for purchase?

Since my bus originally had 15&quot; wheels and some PO put 14&quot;s on it, 
I'm ready to go back to the 15's.

I used to have 15&quot; Chrome 356 replicas on my '67 and really liked 
them, and think I'll do it again.

But $600 for wheel's and tires is a pretty hefty investment...
