&gt; Hi volks,
&gt;   I'm new to the list. Don't know what's kept me so long. Hopefully I'll
&gt; be able to help someone out (own an '89 Westy with it's share of foibles)
&gt; but for now I'm looking for advice. The seal around the cap (poptop
&gt; section) never seemed to be properly attached from day1. I drove the van
&gt; for the first couple of winters and freeze/thaw made a bad situation
&gt; worse. Wound up peeling the whole thing off. The metal strip inside was
&gt; badly corroded. I removed it and cleaned up the inside of the rubber
&gt; strip assuming I would be able to glue it to the cap directly using
&gt; &quot;goop&quot; or someother sort of product.
&gt;     Has anybody tried this or is it necessary to purchase a seal with the
&gt; metal clips inside?

Just before the PO sold the Westy to us, he did this &quot;repair&quot; - he
removed the rusted metal strip and glued with GOOP on to the top. What a
mess, and its coming off in spots, and I can't get it off in some spots.
Some warm summer day we'll have to remove all the smeared GOOP and
install a replacement. 

I'm not saying that it can't be done neatly and securely, its just that
the PO was inept. I'm not willing to see if I'm just as inept GOOP-wise.
