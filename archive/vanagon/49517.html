If I recall there is button to be depressed at the housing were the speedo
cable runs to and from,somewere near the front of the vehicle. Trace or
follow the cable from the drivers side wheel . Sorry that's so vague but
it's been a few years. I think the housing is a black box with a cable and a
recessed button. Good luck

&gt;           The only way  is to unplug it. Find the wires at the
&gt;           sensor and trace them back into the engine area, 
&gt;           where you will find connectors.
