Subject: Re: 84 Westy Compression Test

&gt; I just did a compression test on my 84 Westy which has 153K on the clock (I
&gt; presume that this is the original engine but cannot be sure).  I got
&gt; the following readings (these are &quot;wet&quot; i.e. with oil in cylinder):
&gt; 
&gt; These look pretty good although I am puzzled by #4 which is 23psi above the
&gt; spec for a new engine (90psi).  How could this happen?

   Carbon build up on the piston or other parts of the combustion
   chamber. Try the old water trick.
