&gt; Yes, it is.  Every time you're under the bus.  And have your next engine
&gt; properly balanced.  The engine/tranny interface is a prime nodal junction for
&gt; harmonics set up by an improperly balanced engine.  Often times folks buy a
&gt; long block, stick on their flywheel and go.  Massive imbalance.

This brings a question to mind. Since my recent 
rebuild, my windows vibrate and it seems sometimes 
the entire bus vibrates. How do you &quot;balance&quot; an 
engine?
