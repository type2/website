&gt;Finally, a reminder to John Gladu: you foolishly stated a while back that
&gt;you'd try to send some images/info on the Karbach Kamper -- put up, dude!
&gt;:) I'd really like to add some images to my brief mention of that option.

Life has been interesting (in a Chinese curse kind of way) lately.
It's good that you reminded me, for it had completely slipped my mind. I
actually saw the camper top today as I visited DryDockII for something else
(a table to use at my &quot;over the hill&quot; party), but it never occurred to me
to take a picture :-( (and I had my camera along).  I have the attention
span of the parents of Harrison Bergeron...
I was typing that I'd do the shoot on the 4th, when I take back the rest of
the party stuff, but then I remembered that DryDockII changed their hours
and they're closed on holidays.  *sigh*

Sidebar: I mentioned, at one time, that I have an official VW folding
ladder for use on roofracks and there were some requests for pictures
(which I *did* take, but then put in the stack of, well, pictures).  I
noticed in one of the relatively recent issues of DB&amp;HVWs (one of the ones
that I bothered to get out of the plastic wrapper) several pictures of that
same type of ladder, both in stories and ads.  The ad demonstrated that,
thanks to the ladder, someone could access the rack even while wearing
spike heels.

and...
GREEN LIGHT!  (no oil shows on the dipstick - add a quart of the wrong kind
to get home...)
