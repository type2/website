&gt; &gt;You dog!  Heated seats?  Is there anyway on earth the rest of us mere
&gt; &gt;mortals could aquire such a luxury
&gt; 
&gt; Factory heated seats??  No.  Buy a Tri-Star.
&gt; 
&gt; Aftermarket heated seat covers?? Yes, Martha posted something a month or
so ago
&gt; about some seat cover kind of things she picked up somewhere that you
could
&gt; plug
&gt; into your ciggy lighter. Seemed like an good inexpensive alternative to
the
&gt; real
&gt; thing. 
&gt; Martha, care to enlighten us about where you got them?

I saw a seat warmer manufactured by Sunbeam which was advertised for sale
at Long's Drug Stores in Southern California before Christmas for $29.95
plus sales tax.  Sunbeam has a WWW site.  Search http://www.hotbot_dot_com
