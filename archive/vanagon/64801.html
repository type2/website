Subject:      Westfalia Splitty on Junk Yard

Hello all,

searching for parts I found an original Westfalia Splitty at a local
salvage yard near Dusseldorf, Germany.

It's in a good shape (for this age), even the pop-top and the
fabric attached.

Anyone like to rescue this vehicle? Please forward this mail to
all relevant lists, thank you.
