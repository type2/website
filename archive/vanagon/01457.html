Subject: Canadian Parts for 73 Bus?

Can anyone recommend a reasonable sorce of parts in or near
Ottawa/Ontario/Canada?

As of yesterday I have a 73 Westphalia sitting in my backyard.  It is in
reasonable shape but needs work to be a reliable vehicle.  As might be
expected it needs (for example) new heat exchangers.  I know I can order
these from the states for about US$200 each but I am a little concerned
about the cost of shipping heavy items like these.  Is there a cheap
aftermarket supplier up here?

Also - the most pressing item on the vehicle is the repair or replacement
of the front torsion tube.  The brackets that connect the tube to the frame
are rusty (most of the vehicle is very rust free - for Ottawa).  There
appears to be plenty of solid metal left to weld to.  I figure the whole
assembly should be removed in order to do a reasonable job.  Any pointers?
