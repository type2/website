&gt;I've just finished reading Ted Simon's &quot;Jupiter's Travels&quot; (again!) - 
&gt;around the World on a Triumph motorbike in 4 years in the mid '70s.  
&gt;Great descriptions of  'epics' at the bottom of S. America.  I guess 
&gt;this idea came up at the right time!

I'd also like to recommend &quot;Road Fever&quot; by Tim Cahill, about his
record-breaking journey from Tierra del Fuego to Prudhoe bay.  The entire
North American part of the journey takes place in 2 days in the last
chapter, and the rest of the book is about his 20 days through South
America.  Get it.  Read it.
