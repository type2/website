&gt;i would like to build a 'pin-out' or 'breakout' box for the vanagon 
&gt;ECU harness and computer.  to do this i need a spare, fried is fine, 
&gt;ECU for the connector and a spare, Fried is Fine, wiring harness or 
&gt;just the last few feet for the connector end.  these breakout boxes are 
&gt;available commercially at rediculous prices.
&gt;
&gt;so if anyone has some toasted components sitting behind the christmas 
&gt;tree stand in the garage and would like to clean house, i would 
&gt;gladly reimburse.  OR if someone knows just the equivalent part 
&gt;number for the connectors via electronic supply companies eg DigiKey, 
&gt;that would be cool too.
&gt;
&gt;another question.
&gt;are the ECU connectors the same for all Bosch ECUs or is this a 
&gt;vanagon specific thing?  could one scavenge an old Rabbit, of which 
&gt;there are a zillion out there?
&gt;
&gt;

We have a full set of these cables and breakout boxes. The Digifant
connector is the same that as Mercedes Benz uses on one of their control
units. And yes they aren't cheap (or enven reasonable) but is fun and
enlightening to watch the sensors function and the resulting outputs.
