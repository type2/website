Subject: Re: Pop Top seal replacement

&gt;It seems that most of the Westies I've looked at (from 83 - 87) have
&gt;needed a new pop top seal. ie: once it starts to come apart, it
&gt;rapidly falls apart.
&gt;
&gt;I've priced new seal kits at $600 (dealer) or $150-200 (aftermarket),
&gt;but I was wondering how tough they are to install. It appears they
&gt;thin side section is glued to the wider front section at the two
&gt;front corners - does it come this way, or is special glue needed?
&gt;
&gt;If I'm looking at a Westy which needs a seal, is it better to get the
&gt;seller to replace it first, or talk him down on price and do it
&gt;myself. I'd rather do it myself &amp; know that it's done right, but I'm
&gt;not sure if this is a tough job or not. I see so many vans with
&gt;failing seals, that I'm beginning to wonder if there's a reason for
&gt;the owners not fixing them.

Shawn, I think maybe someone said this but I'll say it again. Pop Top
Campers in Mailibu CA sells pop top seals for $91 plus shipping.  This
comes complete to do the whole top including luggage rack. I've done them
myself it takes no time, hour and half. It lasts forever too. no metal to
rust.  You can call Mark McCulloch at Pop Tops Campers: 1-800-248-2719.  Or
write M.L. McCulloch P.O. Box 2533, Malibu,CA. 90265.  A while back LiMBO
had worked a deal to have free shipping for members.  Mention this when you
call.  If you not a member, wanna be?=)
