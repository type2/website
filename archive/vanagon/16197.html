&gt; Directly behind the passenger seat there is a metal wall (about the same

&gt; stand outside if you wish) but it blocks access to the sliding door latch 
&gt; (in that respect, sounds similar to the Safare).
&gt; 
&gt; Behind the driver's seat there is a full height cabinet, then a sink-water 
&gt; tank-storage tank arrangement.  There is an electric pump for the little sink.

Wow... sounds just like David's Safare, except his has a bubble top 
instead of a pop top.
