Jim, what kind of shape is the glass surface of your windshield like?
I found that because of the angle of the glass and the fact that the
State of Oregon rocks the hell out of the roads in Central Oregon, mine
got beat up pretty bad. The previous owner (my dad) had the windshield
replaced in 1993 for that reason.
