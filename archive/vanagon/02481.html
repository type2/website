Subject: Hey Joel!!

Sorry folks for the broadcast, a couple of specifics for our tempoary mentor..

Joel, 
        1) I'm running Windoze/Winsock/PC-Eudora ver-1.4 for E-mail, and 
have been told ver.2.0 handles graphics ie. PICTURES, diagrams, anything 
that fits into Wordperfect. Any info/thoughts on this type of capability for 
the group? (ps. I don't endorse ANY specific software, please note, I just 
use it)
        2) Noticed something about you and IBM3270, I need a winsock/3270 
GRAPHICS emulator, know of an FTP site? (I have 2 text emulators,nice one 
from McGill Univ./Montreal, no graphics now or ever)
        3) Any Digest option possible for us? Some E-mail readers won't 
handle over 50Kb, I get a PorschePhiles list digest cut-up into pieces.
---&gt;  Any one else interested in a single message digest style? It might 
spoil some of the spontaneity of this list, which is one of its niceties. No 
songs on the Porsche list, most active responses are in arrogant flame wars, 
snore..zzz.   thanks tim s.
