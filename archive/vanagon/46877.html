Subject: Re: Warming Engine OIL

Hi,
	I am a newbie on this list, but have been a lurker on the other 
VW list for some time. I have just bought a '78 Westy, that beautiful 
green color, high mileage, but really good shape.

	When I was having it checked out by the local VW shop, I was told 
that VW mechanics hate the '78's pancake engine. They told me that they 
would install a completely new engine when this one fails, but that they 
would NOT rebuild it. Is this the general opinion among VW folks? If so, 
why? 

	Also, my younger brother has one just like mine (beautiful green 
color and all), except his needs work (body, engine, etc) He has his bus 
running, but says that it is spraying oil, apparently through the 
dipstick tube! Any suggestions for him?

	Thanking you in advance for your kind advice,
