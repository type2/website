Subject: Gas Heater

Well, winter has finally arrived here in DC.  Once again I sit here at my 
keyboard postponing the drive in to work at 15 degrees because I know that 
the bus will stay at 15 degrees for the whole trip.  

Does anyone know what gas heater would have been installed in a '78 bus? 

Do you know this because you have one? 

Do you want to sell it?
