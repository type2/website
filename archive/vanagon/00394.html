Subject: Re: battery tray replacement story

	The best thing to do is make sure your battery tray doesn't
rust out in the first place. A lot of my friends are into SCCA slalom racing,
and have their batteries mounted in plastic boxes with a lid that straps
on. they are usually red and white. Anyways, i picked up one of these to put
my battery in in my '61 bus. Not only did i have the assurance that the tray
wouldn't start to rust, It also looks 100 times better.
