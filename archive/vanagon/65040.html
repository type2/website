Subject:      Coolant and Oil - which types ?

Hello,

        I am a new Vanagon owner and I am going to have the oil changed this
weekend.  Can someone suggest the proper weight of oil I should use ?  I've
been told that I need to use a somewhat heavier oil than what I normally use
in my Subaru (I was told 20-50 for a VW might be a good choice), but I'd like
to hear what the list members have to say about it.  Also should I stay away
from any brands (I've always steered clear of Pennzoil and Quaker State and
usually use Castrol GTX) ?

        Also, my coolant reservoir (the one accessible from the rear behind
the license tag door) is empty, so I expect that I should fill that up (or at
least half way) soon.  Can I use Prestone ?  It appears to be phosphate free,
but again I'd like to hear everyone's opinion on what I should use before I
put some bad stuff in there.

        It is a '90 Vanagon.

        Thanks in advance for any information, comments, etc.


-James
