&gt; Is it really the
&gt; case that generator usage is tolerated in campgrounds?  I would think that some
&gt; anonymous evil would befall a generator in the woods, same as would befall a 
&gt; trombone played for most of the day out there.
&gt; B.

Hey, I frequently take my tuba in a backpack to northern Minnesota for
hiking and playing from views overlooking Lake Superior.  I've never
had another hiker show up while I was playing, much less complain about
the noise.  I pick secluded spots with scenic views for practicing. 

When at lakeside wayside rests, some people pull up next to my Vanagon, walk
to the shore within hearing distance of me practicing on tuba or trombone,
yet on the return trip to their car thank me for playing.  Some people enjoy
music anywhere.

Seriously, I really do these things.  I'm not kidding.  Weird maybe...  But
a musician can't take a break from practicing when there are gigs on the
near horizon even if taking a VW trip.

BTW, some people think my warmup exercises on tuba sound like a foghorn
so maybe I'm actually helping shipping traffic on Lake Superior.  ;^)
