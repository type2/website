Subject: Joel's Statistics...was RE: forgot to include the list ...


There are lies...there are damned lies and then there are Joel's
Statistics....

Unka Joel must be doin' a bit too much of that there reefah while
workin' on the dole of the Allybammah Tackspayerz...me 7,000 +
postings...Unka Joel ONLY 117 or so...

Hey, I may be Polish....but I'm not stupid....lets do some
math here...

Joel publishes the weakly stats, one corrected version of the
weakly stats, and at LEAST two Allybamah state-sponsored
terrorist acts known as Joel's songs and poems... 

His stats are since January...so lets see there are at least
4 posts on FRIDAYS...times what 30 weeks? so thats what..
120 posts right there...

and then there are at least three responses to each of the
three corrections or responses made to the above items...
so thats 3*3*4...or 36 times 30 or sumpin like over
a hunderd tousand or so...

Multiply that by the other postings Joel does and hell..
the number of Joel's postin's is higher than the 
national debt!...or at least higher than the number
of cousins marryin cousins every week down there
in the deep south!

So come on Joel...confess....up date your list...
Joel - a gazillion posts...
Ric - 7,000

Your mathimatically precise, Yankee customer-relations manager of
the virtual garage..Ric  ;-)
