  REGARDING           RE&gt; Bob's Posts to the net &amp; Diesel oil leaks

I find all of Bob's posts to be of great interest.  I invariably learn
something, even if it pertains to a vehicle I don't and in all probability
will never own, or if it has to do with a road adventure or the combination of
various attributes (skill, experience, &quot;cussedness&quot; or whatever) that will see
an individual through a challenging experience.  Learning something every day
is part of differentiates existing from living.  I, for one, enjoy picking up
bits of knowledge that may have no apparent immediate use and trying to file
them away for future recall.  I have found that there can be a synergism of
all these related and unrelated tidbits that often provides the solution down
the road for some problem at hand.  Perhaps it is an extension of a philosophy
from the school I attended - although enrolled in a engineering program, we
were constantly hammered to &quot;stretch your mind&quot; and pick up as much of the
liberal arts world as possible in addition to the straight engineering stuff,
to be as well rounded and diversely educated as possible.  My professional
philosophy, as a one time department manager to my really neat group of people
was, &quot;share what you know and help each other!&quot; That's what Bob's posts do.  
So -- Bob, to the extent that you have the time and are willing to share with
us, please keep those posts coming!!!!

To those diesel Vanagon owners out there -  if you appear to have oil leaks
around the bottom of the engine somewhere - before you condem the oil drain
plug's seal (even if it appears that oil is leaking slowly from the opening),
check the possibility of a hairline crack at the bottom of the oil filler
tube.  (Try washing everything clean, and then stuff a rag around the bottom
of the filler tube for a week or so and then check.  If everything is still
dry and clean but the rag is full of oil, it's a good bet that the filler tube
is cracked around the base/flange somewhere.)  Note that this tube ends in a
flange secured by two bolts.  It has no other support.  Any lateral force
applied to the tube, particularly at the filler cap/dipstick will put
significant strain on the plastic and quite probably lead to one or more fine
cracks near the flange.  Since this flange  is below the oil level in the
crankcase, a slow leak will generate a real mess all around the right rear
corner of the engine compartment and bottom of the crankcase pan.  Replacement
is the only solution, and the new tube and &quot;O&quot; ring runs around $40.
