So thom fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; 	Anyone ever run an 050 distributor?  I just bought one ($4) out
&gt; of curiosity.  Its gonna be for a 1600SP with a 28PICT.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Any data points on advance settings, performance, problems, trials
&gt; and tribulations would be appreciated!

Aren't you the boy who cried, &quot;Wolf!&quot;  :)
