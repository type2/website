Subject: 84 GL potential purchase - questions
Date: Mon, 25 Nov 1996 12:09:55 -0000

I am considering a 1984 Caravelle GL (aka Vanagon is the USA), automatic
with 1913cc water-cooled engine.
Total mileage 182000, 74000 on recon engine.

Some pre-purchase questions:
Is the 1.9 good or to be avoided? The original engine blew up due to a
water leak. Is this a potential re-occurrence?
Should the engine be enclosed underneath? In the air-cooled 2.0 there is a
metal sheet (tin??) but this one is exposed.
How long would you expect a (non-abused) auto gearbox to last when its
already done 182000 miles?
There are 7 seats with armrests. How feasible is it to add an extra seat?
For example in the middle row can you swap out the 2 seater for a 3 seater?
How far do the front seats recline backwards?
How good/reliable is the very long sliding (factory?) sunroof - is it an
advantage or disadvantage?
How does performance compare with the 2.1 litre water and the 2.0 air?

I need to decide in the next day or two.

Thanks,
Lionel Tun
