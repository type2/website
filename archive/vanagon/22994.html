Subject: Pulling/swapping engine?

	My '86 vanagon (manual) has a blown engine, connecting rod threw
top of case.  I'm going to swap it out with a &quot;long-block&quot;, probably from
VW.  I do have the Bentley and Muir books.
	Here are some of my questions:
1) Can I drop the engine with a floor jack without jacking the vanagon?
2) What do I need to pull from my engine before turning it in for core?
	Can anyone send a list?
3) What should I change at the same time (H2O pump, clutch kit)?
4) Any advice?

Tkx to those who responded to previous questions and tkx in advance on 
this set.
