Subject: engine running too cold

fellow vanagoons:

my 90 carat runs too cold.  On days when the temp. outside goes below freezing, 
the beast will operate correctly and warm up is normal.  However, while 
cruising _at_ 65 mph the engine will cool dramatically and actually fool the 
engine to go into a cold start senario. the result is a mixture rich enough to 
force a pull over to allow the engine to heat up agian. T-Stat Right?  Nope. 
The new Thermstat failed to correct the problem. obviously over heating has 
never been a problem even while pulling a 67 beetle in august with the AC on 
and a small pit crew aboard.  Any Ideas?  Thanks.
