&gt; 
&gt; Greetings, van list!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm back after an extended absence.
&gt; 
&gt; As I had mentioned when I left I have a '65 Deluxe Bus, in bare metal
&gt; at the present.  I am almost ready to go to paint, in mid January.
&gt; 
&gt; I am presently looking for information and would like to solicit
&gt; the list's input.
&gt; 
&gt; I am basically redesigning this bus and will make significant
&gt; changes to the powertrain.  I will be using a SCAT T6 4 piece 356 alum.
&gt; wet sump case with their Volkstroker 78mm nitirded crank.  I have found
&gt; a supplier of Porsche square finned jugs (93mm thick wall) and a set of
&gt; split heads to top it off (so to speak).  I should be running between
&gt; 145 and 160 HP.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem is the transmission.  I would like to have input VW versus
&gt; Porsche, 4speed VW vs. Berg 5-speed VW, and any suggestions that will 
&gt; help in the decision process.
&gt; 
&gt; And as a second like of thought, disc brakes.  Can I use 'em, can I get
&gt; 'em.  Can I use porsche 914 brakes and calipers on a bus with good results?
&gt; Does anybody have experience with discs on an old bus?
&gt; 
&gt; I am at the point where I can make these decisions and have some 
&gt; flexibility  with what I put on as basic equipment.  If I plan
&gt; for a system before it all goes together, I can work out issues that
&gt; would maybe compromise other systems by adding them after the bus was 
&gt; complete.
&gt; 
&gt; I will accept ALL comments with gratitude.  Feel free to tell me I'm
&gt; crazy if you think I am, but tell me why.  I will appreciate your
&gt; technical expertise.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Cecil
