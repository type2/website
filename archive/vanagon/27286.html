I think you are confused over what a barndoor is.  It's NOT the double 
doors on the side.  It's a large engine hatch, and they have no rear 
hatch other than the engine hatch.

The sliding door option started in about '64, and became standard in '68 
model year.  I've heard that the double doors were still available as an 
option after '67.
