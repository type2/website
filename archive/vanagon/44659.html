Subject: Re: Scat Enterprises?

So Dworkin says:

&gt; Anybody have any experience of Scat Enterprises, out of Redondo Beach, CA?

It is said that Porsche has experience with them*. It is told that they 
obtain the cranks for old flat four Porsches from them. If this is true you
can be sure they deliver good quality. Btw, Porsche has a division dedicated
to classic Porsches, Porsche Classic GmbH.

*I believe i read that in 'California Volkswagens' by Keith Seume.
