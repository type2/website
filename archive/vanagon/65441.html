Subject:      &lt;question&gt;Westy cushion cover replacements

Does anyone know a source for replacement rear seat/bed covers?  The
seat has a Westy tag inside and it came from an '84 Wolfsburg Edition I
found in the junkyard.  The cushions are OK but the covers are worn and
have a few rips and stains........Any help would be appreciated.

Steve           '81  7-passenger, now slightly Westy'd
                '77  7-passenger, mobile parts shed (soon to change)
