Subject:      late model side body mouldings

Hi All!
You know them nice fancy color matched side panels the fancier
Vanagons have? Can you get a set to match my plain old grey bumpers?
I like my greys, but also dig those panels. I think Bessie'll look
cooler with them.  Any ideas on how much they might cost and would
the dealer or a body shop put em on? I couldn't do it, I'd get 'em
all crooked.
