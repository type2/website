Subject: Re: Kombi, Kombi, who's got the Kombi ... (differences)


I had a '61 9-passenger, a '67 kombi, a '76 7-passenger and
now a '81 7-passenger....

The early buses came in bench-front-seat with an option
for split-front-seats.  There were windowless models and
fully outfitted passenger models.  The kombi was inbetween:
it had the windows but was empty behind the driver's seat.
It was a solid color and the passenger models were two-toned.
When Germany put a tariff on US chickens (frozen?) to protect
German farmers in ~'62, JFK retaliated with a tariff on
German &quot;trucks&quot;--and the kombi was one.  So VW started putting
a rear seat into them, making them &quot;passenger vehicles&quot; and
exempt from the tax.  The seat was cheaper than the tax.

My brother's '62 kombi was without-seat.  My '67 had the
seat.

I always wanted a kombi with the side doors on BOTH sides....  :-)
