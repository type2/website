Subject:      buncha replies all rolled into one ...

first!  i'd like to kinda dispell the impression that this list is somehow
MINE ... it is NOT. Gerry Skerbitz is the List-Manager or whatever you want
to call the guy that set it up, and has the thankless job of running the
software and hardware to keep it going &lt;except when he goes on vacation for
half-a-year and dumps it on some poor unsuspecting redneck to run by remote
control!!!&gt;

so i'm just the guy with the same name as the other Joel :)   and the one
who keeps up with all the microbuses, buses, vanagons, and eurovans he can
spot trundling across the Internet. i guess if Gerry could be condsidered
the Driver of the List, i'm the widdle kid in the back seat, yelling &quot;Are
We There Yet? Are We There Yet?&quot;.  :)  i appreciate the accolades, but please
let's give credit where it is due: All Hail Gerry, the List-Whatever. ;)
&lt;&quot;wrest control&quot;, indeed!!!&gt;

pushrods: since i haven't done it yet, i can't say for sure, but i cannot
believe vw would screw up and make the head come off. on the air-cools Type
4 engines, it's was really easy to remove the tubes: you took the rocker
arm assemblies off ... and there was this dippy little spring wire that &quot;held&quot;
the tubes in place. see if you can take the valve cover off one side (you'll
probably have to buy one of those new gaskets from the dealer) and see if it
looks like the rocker arm assembly (the whole thing ... actually, two whole
things i think ... four bolts) comes off. i'll have to check the book when
i get home, but with coolant inside the cyl  like that, i just can't believe
they would make the head come off to fix an oil leak. i could be wrong. :(

silver secret: ok, fess up. you guys are making this up, right? anybody try
to trace the power source and see what if and to what it is fused? it's got
to be some sort of optional accessory. and since it is over by the driver,
one might assume it is driver-related.  i don't think it would be an 'input'
plug (like for trickle-charging the battery or for 2nd batteries) since it
is placed like that in the dash. coffee-heater? seat-warmer (early version)?

lower temp thermostat: derek, any part numbers on that thermostat?

Matthew's diesel dilemma: might you consider a gasoline replacement? to
tantalize your wife with real (albeit minor) acceleration might calm her
fears. i'm not trying to start a diesel-gas war (again), but it's a thought.
there would be lots more rabbit gas engines out there than the diesels. and
likely cheaper.  or you could check with Cetin Seren and see how much he
wants for his 82 Diesel Camper ... and use yours as spare parts? just rambling
out loud.

uj (short for Unca Joel) :)
