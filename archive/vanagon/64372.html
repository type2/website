Subject:      1998 Syncro &quot;Convention&quot; Dates

Syncronauts,

For all those interested in attending the Syncro &quot;Convention&quot; at the 1998
Jeep Easter Safari, here's a bit more information.  The event begins
Saturday, April 4th and culminates on Easter, Sunday, April 12, 1998.

This annual event is open to all 4WD vehicles, not just Jeeps as the name
implies and is sponsored by the Red Rock 4-Wheelers and the Moab, Utah
Chamber of Commerce.  The events and trail rides take place in and around
Moab, Utah.

Our registration must be in by sometime in mid-February (a specific date will
be setablished) to assure a reasonable chance at getting the trails we
desire.

Please email me if you're interested in attending.  If you previously
replied, I've saved your email, so you don't need to do it again.

I don't care for the name &quot;convention&quot;.  Any better ideas?
Syncro Roundup?
Syncro Safari?
Syncro Spectacular?
Syncro Rally?
Syncros by the ????

Regards,
Jim Davis

PS: From my previous message (&quot;Syncro Convention Proposed&quot;, 5/25/97)
about this event:
=====================================================

[I propose a] &quot;Syncro Convention&quot; - sort of.  I'd like to tool around the
trails in my Syncro as Jay has done and I'd really like to do it with 3 or 4
(or 50) other Syncros.

Each Easter four wheelers decend on Moab for the Easter Jeep Safari put on by
the Red Rock 4-Wheelers.  While &quot;Jeep&quot; is in the title, the event is open to
all 4WD vehicles.  They organize a bunch of trail runs rated from 2.5 (fairly
mild, 4WD required) to 4+ (BIG tires, LOW gears, locking differentials and
winches!).
I think this would be an ideal time for Syncronauts from all over to gather
at Moab and do some wheelin'.  I know there will be a TON of other 4-wheelers
there at this event, and that would be sort of part of the point.  I really
enjoy seeing the jaws of Jeep drivers drop when I meet theem on the trail.
 Having a whole group of us will multiply the effect and be especially fun!

I volunteer to coordinate this effort and handle the registration (yes, it's
quite organized) for the group.  This registration will need to be done in
February.
