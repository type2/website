well... it's been awhile since i put it on... and the results are a hung jury.

yes, it does dramatically renew the fiberglass top's paint, on mine a
chalky TITAN RED, to a glossy, deep red finish that looks darn new.  but it
has some problems...

i don't know how long i've had it on (someone check my post date) but it is
wearing off.  it sorta gets the appearance of skin sloughing off a sunburn.
 it also forms white water spots after a rain.  the stuff would drive a
meticulous person crazy if they were going for an OEM paint job.

however.  it took years off the appearnce of the top.  i'm mildly satisfied
with the results for the cost.  but don't expect miracles to last.  will i
recoat?  dunno.  mebbe a refresher coat.

WARNING:  yes this stuff could be used to really dress up a top prior to
sale.  just get above the van and look as the people probably didn't do the
whole top, just the sides (as i did, too).  buyer beware.
