Subject: '84 problem

Volks:

I am the DCO (Dreaded Current Owner) of a gorgeous 1984 Westy with 71,000
original miles on it. We've had two recent problems. First came the slow
oil leak. Then came the red overheating light.

Being basically a clueless DCO (see above) I brought our bus to the
friendly independent garage that has worked on it in the past and pleaded
for mercy.

(While I was at it, I  brought along a condensed version of information
about coolants and phosphate gleaned from this list and the archives. The
coolant hadn't been checked since coming out of winter storage and I
figured as long as the bus was in the shop it was high time we did
something about it.)

Well, I picked the bus up today and found myself $110 poorer. I wasn't
complaining though, because they said everything was fixed. They had
replaced a radiator hose and a $10 oil &quot;sender.&quot; The leak was gone and it
shouldn't overheat they said.

Tell it to my wife, who saw the red light come on a half hour after leaving
the shop and then sat for 45 minutes before nursing the bus the last two
miles home.

I guess I should have been a little suspicious when the mechanic said he
didn't &quot;top off&quot; the coolant because &quot;there aren't no such thing&quot; as a
coolant without phosphates. &quot;That's what makes them work,&quot; he said, looking
at me as if I was more of an auto idiot than I am. Of course, &quot;Topping off&quot;
wasn't why I had brought him the printout about coolant problems.

Oh, and for good measure, as we walked out the door he told us we have a
coolant leak. Gee thanks.

I think it's time to visit the semi-local VW bus guru if I can find a way
to drive the 40 miles without breaking down completely.

Any suggestions?
