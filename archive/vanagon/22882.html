&gt;      &gt;Well the new rubber etc. is going in my front door windows with all 
&gt;      &gt;the glass and little metal pieces.  What I can't figure
&gt;      &gt;out is how to attach the metal piece with the notches in it that the 
&gt;      &gt;sliding windo latches to.  It has screw holes it it, but there are 
&gt;      &gt;none in the door top.  Does it screw into the felt strip, rubber 
&gt;      &gt;strip under that, or what?
&gt;      
&gt;      The notched strip screws onto the inside of the door frame. So it 
&gt;      should have holes for these screws.

Wow, our buses must be different somehow, because unless a piece of
my door frame is missing, it has no screw holes.  A slice of my door
would look like this:

Above this is a rubber piece, mostly flat except for an outer
bead which has a groove that fits around the left upper &quot;lip&quot;
in the picture.  Then above that is a felt/rubber strip with
2 channels in it for the two windows.  So the inner part of the
inside (where the notched strip has to go) is only felt.

There is a little rubber block right that goes right in
front of the fixed window that has a screw hole in it, so
my best guess is that a screw goes through  the notched
piece, then the felt and into the rubber block.

Hmmmmmm.  Where does your notched piece attach?

P.S. My bus is a '62 Kombi.  Don't you have a Deluxe?  Maybe
with all that extra trim there is more stuff to screw things
to.
