Subject: Re:  RE 12 volt shop supply

&gt;According to the
&gt;national electrical code, all lead acid battery installations should be
&gt;vented to outside air. Unsealed lead acid batteries are notorious fire hazards.
&gt;Unfortunately, I know this from experience as a good friend of mine died in
&gt;a van fire which was started by a battery. The battery was mounted in a
&gt;plywood box in the back of the van and it was used to power his hydraulic power
&gt;wheel chair lift. Keep lead acid batteries vented at all times as explosive
&gt;hydrogen gas is generated from them if you are considering using them as
&gt;described in the article.

	GOOD ADVICE!

	Having personnally seen serveral burned VW bug hulks where a battery
	was suspected as the cause, I've been sensitized to this issue.
 
	A good preventive measure for Westy dual battery installations 
	would be to use SEALED batteries (like Delco or Sears) for BOTH 
	batteries. AT A MINIMUM, on a single battery installation, make sure
	that the Vanagon passenger side battery compartment vent is unblocked!

	Having examined a 95 EuroVanCamper(Winnie) this weekend, I noticed that
	the &quot;coach&quot; battery is in a compartment behind the rear seat along 
	with the power converter. I didn't look closely enough to see if
	it was one of the sealed varieties...

	In another recent thread, the subject of cracked, leaking rubber
	hoses in the fuel system came up again. This is another cause of 
	VW fires. Proactive replacement of any of the fuel system textile 
	clad rubber hoses (especially if older than 5 years, and sometimes
	within 3 years if exposed to heat and high ozone environments) can 
	save your vehicle. The fact that VW (and other German manufacturers) 
	don't seem to understand this is CRIMINAL!
