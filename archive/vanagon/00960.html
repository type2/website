Subject: Re: Tiring Question

&gt;Looked at some Michelin 'X' P205-70-14 and some &quot;metric radials&quot; also by them.
&gt;The 'P' tires had an 88,000 mile treadwear guarantee and the metrics had a
&gt;lower treadlife. Question what are the differences between 'P' tires and
&gt;metric radials? $20 each, yeah I know that. COSTCO price for the 'P's was
&gt;about $72 US. The tire specialist (ha!) at COSTCO explained the differences by
&gt;saying there weren't really any.

I would verify that the rated inflation pressure is the same.  We have had 
considerable consistently finding tires rated for 49 psi rear pressure 
recommended for the '84.  We have found it does make a handling difference.
