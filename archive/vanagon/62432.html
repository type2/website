&gt;For clothes and stuff that can be compressed without being damaged
&gt;consider canoeing style &quot;drybags&quot; instead of a box. They seal completely
&gt;waterproof, and are eary to hoist up and strap down. I also
&gt;expect less extra wind drag than from a box. Drybags comes
&gt;in sizes up to about 70l (70l is about the volume of a large suitcase or
&gt;backpack). I think one could fir up to 4 large bags on the rack.
&gt;I've had three drybags and one 5 gal jerry can up there.
&gt;Price for drybags? $15-$30 at your canoeing shop or sports store.
&gt;Sealline by Cascade designs are durable

I admit that my solution was a little more expensive...I bought the Sherpa 7 bag for about $150.  The 
straps are too wide for the tie downs so I bought boat fasteners (they are little u-shaped pieces of 
metal with a small screw that finsihes the C into a D. Although they aren't theft proof...you'd need to 
spend some time unscrewing them.  The Sherpa worked well and compressed well.  It is meant to 
go the longway but worked well for us.   I used about 6 bungee cords as well.  I only used the 
crossover straps on the Sherpa to compress the compartment.  Between the boat fasteners and the 
bungee cords the sherpa did the job.
