 So here's the question... I assume the battery in Moo is orginal 
 equipment.  ( It looks that way ) SSo, its, what eight years old... would 
 that be about the life span of the VW made battery or should it last 
 longer?  I checked and the only permanent drain on the battert is that 
 LCD clock behind the steering wheel.  I figure that cant be sucking back 
 much &quot;jusic&quot; or can it?   Should I just go get another battery &gt;  A 
 question for the list lurkers!!! &gt;&gt;

Eight years and you question it's conditon.  You are at the very least 3
years over due.  Treat Moo to a new one.  I've found the Exide international
series work very well for this vehicle.  Avoid Die Hards and Delco's.
