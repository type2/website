Subject: Old Bus Backfire Issue 5 *long-SE regional*


This is the latest newsletter from the Atlanta area bus club.  Points
of interest for those of you in the Southeast are the Spring Campout,
Buses on the Blue Ridge, and the 3rd Annual Vintage Show &amp; Shine.

Greetings!

Greetings fellow bus-nuts. I hope everyone is getting their bus ready for
a full schedule of VW-related events. I'm pretty stoked!  I have just 
returned from the IVWA Bug Bash in N.C..  There I saw two types of old 
buses which I'd never seen before.  A 1956 Westfalia, original condition,
gas heater, roof rack and tent.  The bus still has the original 36 hp 
motor and was driven to North Carolina from California in 4 days.  A 1959
Firetruck from Germany with all the original fire fighting equipment 
including working siren and lights.  The swap meet at the show was 
smaller than last year, but I still managed to spend all the money I 
brought with me.  I hope to see many of you at the upcoming events.

Upcoming Events

April 29-30	PST's Spring Campout

This campout will be held at Indian Springs State Park, 30 miles south of
Atlanta at I-75 and Ga. Hwy. 42. near Jackson Ga.  Everyone is invited to 
attend even if you don't want to camp.  Come on down Saturday afternoon 
to visit and participate in an informal swap meet.  Some people will be 
going down Friday night, so watch for them.  For specifics on a caravan 
going down Saturday morning give me a call.  This is always a lot of fun 
so don't forget your cameras and extra parts.

May 12-14	The Great Smoky Mountain Bug Run 95

This was a lot of fun last year and should be even better this year. 
Anyone interested in caravanning should give me a call.  We take Ga. Hwy. 
411, instead of the Interstate, which is a beautiful easy 4 hour drive. 
For more info. see enclosed flyer.

June 2-4	Buses on the Blue Ridge

We will be caravanning up to the Blue Ridge Parkway near Asheville N.C. 
on June 2nd.  If you are interested give us a call. There will be buses 
from as far away as Canada, Missouri and Florida.  For more info call 
Neil Pickett _at_ (704) 665-1650.

June 25	Vintage Show &amp; Shine

The &quot;Biggest and Best Air-Cooled VW Show in the Southeast&quot; will again be 
held at Southern Tech this June 25th.  This show is sponsored by Peach 
State Transporters and will most undoubtedly be even bigger and better 
than the last two years.  With this in mind, we will need much more help 
from club members to be able to host a really great show.  PST is the 
sole sponsor for this event, so please volunteer!  We will start getting 
together to work everything out soon.  Also if you have suggestions on 
how to make the show even better let us know ASAP.

PST's March Meeting Report

On Sunday afternoon, March 12th a large group of buses and trucks met at 
Southern Tech to caravan up to the McDonald's in Woodstock.  The caravan 
included David Easterwood - 66 Scud Camper; Dewayne Epperson - 67 Crew-
cab; Bob Jarman - 65 Crewcab; Jerry Peters - 68 Singlecab; Ronnie Hunter
- 68 Singlecab; Pete Durand - 66 Camper; Bob Stanek - 60 Panel Van; 
Walter Donilla and Allen Becker (in non VWs).  Also there were two new 
members, Jason Mogi - 66 Deluxe and Michael Masseau - 66 Deluxe.  Those 
who met us at McDonald's were Nick Azzolesi - 66 Kombi; Gordon Hunter - 
61 23-window; Tim Humphreys - 63 Crewcab; and Chris Martel - 72 Bus. 
Items discussed were:  The upcoming Vintage Volkswagen 3rd Annual Show &amp; 
Shine, the Spring Campout, and Buses on the Blue Ridge.  Dues of $3.00 
per year to help defray the cost of producing and mailing this newsletter
to everyone.  Many members paid this and Allen and wife Susie were glad 
to accept it. Suggestions were made for more one day caravans and more 
campouts.  I would like to thank everyone for coming out and was 
immensely pleased with the turnout.  I was happy everyone brought along
friends and family.
