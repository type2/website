 Strangely enough, I get lots of glares and fingers
&gt;from both groups. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

just to let everybody know that &quot;polite&quot; Canadians are not immune to the
above actions.

whiltst driving the 65' westy on a road trip this past summer (holiday
weekend) w/ wife and child i received numerous fingers for driving my bus
at the 90kmh posted speed (55mph for yu folks south of the border)! FWIW
everyone else seemed to be doing about 120knm :0!

i goes as fast as i can but 120kmh the bus she canna' do!

michael (love those full sized domestic yank tanks)
