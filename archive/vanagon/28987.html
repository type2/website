Subject: diagnosis anyone?


Hi everyone,
	My '79 bus is out of commission and before I start tearing things 
apart this weekend, I thought that I would see what everyone thought 
might be the problem.  On trying to start the bus, it has plenty of power 
but acts like the engine is locked up.  I followed the advise in Muir's 
book and put it in third and pushed it backwards to &quot;free up&quot; the 
starter.  When I do this and turn the key, it grinds and the engine 
starts to turn over a little and then it sticks again.  My mechanic buddy 
says that I'm right to suspect the starter and that a replacement should 
take care of the problem.  He will warranty this starter because we just 
put it in about 3 months ago.  So, the questions are ... 1) do you all 
agree with this diagnosis? and 2) should I do anything else while the 
starter is out to prevent this problem from coming back anytime soon.  
thanks for your opinions on this,
dave.
