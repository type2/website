Subject: Re: broken wire survey!

Have fixed the speaker wires twice on my 82 westy!

Now leave my van from the passenger side whenever possible for this and other
reasons, i.e. lock wearing out and having to lock with key on driver's side.

Not a big deal after 13 years of wedded bliss to my van I can overlook a few
warts!
