&gt;...  I'm looking at buying an '87 Westy,
&gt;well maintained but with 160,000 miles.  The usual has been replaced:
&gt;water pump
&gt;cv joints
&gt;currently needs exhaust but not head gaskets
&gt;My question is this:  Is there any parts that will be ready for
&gt;replacement just as a straight function of high miles-- regardless of
&gt;it being well-maintained?  Clutch? Brakes? Tranny? Rings?

brakes. especially the rear brakes, if they haven't already been done.
tranny. if it was gonna break, it shudda done so by now.
front rotors might need replacing. $160 each.
all four sets of wheel bearings (if not already done).
all coolant hoses ($800 for a set from the dealer!!!!) ... maybe.

i don't know of anything on the vanagons or even water-cooled vanagons that
especially wears ... at least, no more than any other car. any older car with
lotsa miles needs to be looked at with a jaundiced eye. ;)  and save back at
least half the cost of the car for 'repairs' that might be needed.

me, personally, i'd get paranoid and replace ALL the fluids and bearings and
such ... just so *I* would know the condition. stuff like that.
