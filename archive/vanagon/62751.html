Subject: We're off!


Well, practically.  Just 2 more hours of work, then a few hours of sleep 
and up the coast we go!  Many thanks for all the interesting sight-seeing 
tips, repair info and offers for help.  The van is as ready as 
it can be, all things considered.  Can't wait to pop the top, fire up the 
stove and all that good stuff.  I hope I have some good adventures to 
share with the list when I return (the kind of adventures where the van 
keeps on running perfectly :)  Talk to ya'll soon!
