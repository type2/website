Subject: RE: Personalized License Plates


&gt;AS it is Friday, and I got back from an actually pleasant visit at the DMV, 
I
&gt;thought I'd bring up the thread on personalized license plates, 
specifically
&gt;those relating to VW's. You can gain a lot of insight into folks from their
&gt;plates, even from the fact that they went to the trouble of getting one...
&gt;Anyway, my old one was:
&gt;
&gt;OLDNDWAY
&gt;and the new one is
&gt;NFA 4295  (a &quot;stealth&quot; hippie plate so as to avoid a bit of hassle)


In any list this size, no matter how intelligent and/or perceptive the 
normal
clientele is, there's always someone who just doesn't get it.
In this case, I qualify without reservation.

OK, what does NFA 4295 stand for?   &lt;hanging head in shame&gt;
