Subject: Re: Westi's and towing small boats

Eric, 
I have towed a 14 foot runabout for the last two summers.  Avoid
slipping the clutch when loading and unloading. I am now having trouble
with my 1st gear syncronisers(sp).  My van now pops out of gear with
back pressure on the trans. This may be due to high mileage or towing.?
With hind sight,I think I would avoid towing given how expensive bus
drive lines are to replace or rebuild.

&gt; Anyone out there have any experiance with towing small boats or watercraft
&gt; with your vanagons?  Anything to be cocerned about.  I have a friend who
&gt; wants to by an 82 Westy. It has a new motor but he is concerned about the
&gt; lack of power to pull his small boat.
