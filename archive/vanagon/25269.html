I cant really give you advice on good shocks but I can warn you away 
from some bad ones.  There is a national chain of autoparts stores 
called Car Quest.  Last time I needed shocks for my '78 Ford E150 I 
got their gas charged spcial for $16.  well, 8 months later I was 
looking for shocks again.  Be carefull and make sure you get a well 
known brand.  It is worth spending a little extra money for something 
that will give you a comfortable ride and last a while.
