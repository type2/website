&gt; results? Should I run the new 12V wire directly from the alternator or from 
&gt; the battery?

I haven't popped the lights out on my Westy yet, but I went through 
this in my Jetta which also uses 9004 bulbs. I put in 55/100w bulbs &amp; 
promptly fried (melted) the plastic connectors. I ran a relay, along 
with 14g wire to ground &amp; battery, and fried two more connectors. 
Then I tried 3 separate spade connectors carefully inserted into the 
bulbs. This seemed to work fine, I guess the air space allowed them 
to dissipate the heat. The bulbs burnt out &amp; replaced with stock &amp; 
added H3 driving lights instead.
