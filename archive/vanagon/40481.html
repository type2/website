FWIW

Motor City VW/Subaru in Cumberland MD recently changed
their name to Motor City Subaru, getting rid of the whole 4
VW's and meager parts inventory they had in one fell flood.


No tears will be shed, like most VW dealers today, it deserved
to be put out of it's misery, was little more than a tax write
off for the dealership, course now I'm 90 miles from dealer parts.
