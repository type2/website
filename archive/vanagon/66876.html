Subject:      I still have Air Flow Meters! And MORE!

I had posted before about these units, I'm reposting for the people
that may have missed it or forgot about this great deal.

  86 and up Vanagon AFM's for $100.00 Plus S&amp;H.  I have a few left and
would like them to go to a good home:)

  There are still a couple of the ZF Power steering racks too, $450.00
Plus a Core.  If you're not familiar with the difference between the ZF
rack and the other &quot;Rebuilt&quot; racks on the market call me or e-mail me
and I'll let you know the difference.

  Also a few of the Brake Booster/Master Cylinder units, $100.00 for
these and that's the price of a Master.  Basically you get a Booster for
free!

  As some of you will remeber I had the Syncro Air Filters, I still have
about 8 of those too.  $20.00 each Plus S&amp;H.
