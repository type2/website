Subject: It's stalling out...?


This is on my 1980 Westy.

My engine just started to act up.  When I start it, it will start up, but 
then immediatly die out.  I guess while it was sitting a bunch of oil 
leaked out, but it was around min. level.  So I filled it up to Max.  
Though it still won't stay running.  I sure hope there isn't anything 
serious occuring!

Any thoughts?

Kyle
