A slight change to Thom's fine rendition:

Someone let the bus out - in the fog,
and I don't think I can see it,
'cause the lights, they don't cut it,
and I don`t wanna cause another crack up, again!!!

OH, NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


...on second thought, I think I'll take Steven`s advice and check myself
into Agnews this afternoon...
