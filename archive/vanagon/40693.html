&gt;Two questions for my experts.  1. why is the temperature gauge only 
&gt;going a quarter up instead of halfway?  2. had the heads replaced a 
&gt;a few months ago and last month had the two oil pressure switches  
&gt;replaced.  Now, a third leak developed.  VW says it is leaking from 
&gt;the oil cooler which is behind the oil filter.  The o rings must be 
&gt;replaced and its parts plus one and a half hours.  Does this sound 
&gt;correct?  tia  Sherwin

Is the oil cooler leaking oil or water.  The &quot;O&quot; rings seal the oil, not the
water.  Water leaking could be either the hoses or the cooler case itself.
 Foir real fun, these coolers sometimes leak internally.  This allows the
cooling system to fill with oil making a real mess.  I personally hate thse
things.  I replaced the set-up in the FUN BUS with a 16 plate cooler mounted
in front with a 180F thermostat. Works great.
