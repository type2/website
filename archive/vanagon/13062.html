Subject: Re: parking brake

here is my two cents on this one.
    As I recall, the vanagon's brakes must be adjusted by hand.  I don't 
recall that the back up trick works for them, I may be wrong.  The way 
that I adjust mine is be the littlle star nut inside the drum which 
adjusts the pad distance from the drum.  It is accessed from the back 
pllate through a smalll holle via a screw driver.  LLets see, is it 
cllock wise or counter clllock wise?  Onllly takes one try to find out, 
but it has been a few year since I've done it.  Can Anyone Verify (CAV)?
This terminalll llllikes it's ellllllls, BTW.
             wallt.
