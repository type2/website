Subject: Auto Coolant Facts: ALL You Want to Know!

Volks,
All the talk of coolants sent me off on an Alta Vista research mission
on this matter. A lot of interesting on auto coolant data, which seems
to be nearly exhaustive yet succint, is found in an Australian website:

This press release addresses most all of the issues I have seen brought
up on the Vanagon list concerning coolant.
