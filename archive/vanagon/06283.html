Well I just joined the list today,  So I would like to say hello.   Now I have 
a question.  I just bought a 69 bus  for 600  body is pretty clean and it seems
to run pretty good once I get it started.  Here's the situation  it's has a 72 
type 4 engine with dual carbs and an electric fuel pump.  It starts up fine at 
first but once the engine is warm I have a hard time starting it.  Also looking
over the enginge I notice there is a dip stick near the oil filler and then 
there seems to be another dead center on top of the engine.  I am not really 
familiar with this engine.  SO any suggestion out there.  Is' been 2 years 
since I have driven a bus and boy was it a great feeling to get back behind the
wheel of one.
Thanks
