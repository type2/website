Subject: 84 Westy Runs Rough...

Hello all from an ex-lurker.
I own an 84 Camper (watercooled) and I'd like to ask for advice about the way
she runs, but the symptoms may be part of a complex:

Historically I have had the rusty fuel tank problems, and I had the tank removed
and welded over 5 years ago, but I still occasionally get a whiff of fuel when I
top-off the tank, so I suspect some minor leakage...also the fuel pump whines
sometimes (air?) though I changed it a year ago as an attempt to get her running
again by the side of a busy road in S.E. Pa.  I have taken to carrying spare
fuel filters on trips and they have saved the day on several occasions.  At this
point I am shopping around for the best deal on a new fuel tank.

Back to that break down a year ago...she began lurching (losing, re-gaining,
losing power) then just completely cut out on me.  We rolled to a stop, I
changed the fuel filter, no start.  I changed the fuel pump (yes I had one on
board), no start.  I believe I flooded her bad trying to get her to start.
Finally had her towed home.

Took her to my mechanic, he found fuel in the crankcase oil and changed it.  He
disconnected the idle stabilizer, played with the mix, and she started and ran
OK last winter and this spring.  Here a month ago she starts to lurch again, but
didn't die outright on me.  I changed the oil, plugs, rotor, distributor cap,
and she is running OK.

My basic question is, do you think I can continue without the idle stabilizer,
or should I be replacing it too?  My mechanic apparently always tries taking
these out of the circuit and tuning without them.  Is the idle stab. necessary?
More generally, any ideas about my running problems?  How about the fuel in the
oil incident, is that common?  I keep wondering if all this is ultimately caused
by the rotten tank, and if a new one might be the cure.

Any thoughts on my situation much appreciated!
