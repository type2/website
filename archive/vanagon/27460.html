I stand corrected.  I was thinking in the context of the state of California
and it's smog inspection which includes( in addition to other tests)  a visual
inspection pass/fail  for the presence of various items.  Leaded gas hasn't
been available here for quite a while, so the need for a nozzel restricter in
a replacement part seems somewhat unnecessary.
