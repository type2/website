Subject: Re:Eurovan Electrical Problems

&gt; David M. and Norman write that they had intermittent guage problems with
the fuel and I believe the coolant temp guages in their Eurovans.  I too
had the problem with the fuel guage.  Fortunately it was still in warranty
and after two trips to the dealer problem solved.  The dealer ordered a new
sender unit, dropped the fuel tank, and then discovered that the problem
was a loose wire in the dash.

Good Luck
