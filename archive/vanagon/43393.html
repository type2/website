So john wakefield says:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;In the RV world they recomend putting chlorine (I use chlorine bleach)
&gt; the water and then flushing the tank out good. I think a cup or so in the
&gt; tank full of water, let it sit for 30 minutes to kill the germs, drain, 
&gt; then
&gt; fill and flush twice. Kills bugs dead.&quot;

You can't flush (rince) too many times.  This is for those of you that
don't 'just love' the taste of chlorine. ;)
