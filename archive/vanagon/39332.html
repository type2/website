&gt; 1. I need to find a good set of after market wires for my van. Does any one
&gt;have any suggestions.

Go to the dealer and pay your money.  These last allmost forever.  I have had
many problems with the ends shorting out on the aftermarket wires regardless
of brand.  There must be a deal where all the defective stuff goes to the
aftermarket as these ends are also &quot;German&quot;.  I hate the 6 month comebacks.
