Derek is correct -- our Vanagon alternator puts out a little
less than 14V _at the alternator_ .  Because of this, not only 
is the forward voltage drop of the diodes in an isolator a
problem, but voltage drop across relay contacts and throughout
the system is a problem -- so use the best, lowest-resistance
relays you can find, and use big beefy cable.
