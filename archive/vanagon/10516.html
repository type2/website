So Alistair Bell says:
&gt; 
&gt; Who knows, maybe a wet (with water) filter has different flow
&gt; characteristics than a non-wet one (hydrophobic filter material, I know
&gt; this sounds contradictory, but some of the hydrophobic filters I use at
&gt; work won't pass shit when wet...)
&gt; 

Trying to pass shit through a filter eh?  That must be a fun experiment.
;)

Alistair, are you going to give me a snail mail address so I can send
this stuff to you?
