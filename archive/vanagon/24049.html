Subject: Re: '61 crew cab value

&gt;There are no frills (i.e. Safari windows) on my '67.  The PO
&gt;had rigged a hoops-and-canvas top for the bed (including
&gt;some less-than-stock screw holes).  Since I have a '67
&gt;Deluxe Sunroof and '67 Westfalia, the Double Cab keeps my
&gt;'67 collection going.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe I got lucky on the price for mine (felt lucky at the
&gt;time).  You sound like a good home for the '61 if the $$$
&gt;are there to buy it.

Your '67 collection sounds great, Jim.  I'm wondering about the $$$ for the
'61, since I don't happen to have $3,500 lying around begging for something
to do at this moment. &lt;g&gt;  It is really pulling at my nostalgia strings,
though - so I'll probably take another look on Tuesday when the shop opens
up.  I'll follow up here with what I decide.
