Subject: 70 Bus FS-Chattanooga, Tn

I am posting this for a student who has a 70 bus for sale.  His ad:

&quot;New tires, new brakes, new shocks, good paint.  New clutch, engine rebuilt
recently.  No holes in headliner, driver's seat has 2 small slits. Brand
new tape deck.  $2500&quot;  (but I think he will come down.)

I quickly visualed it this morning.  There is some pin hole rust in the
rear wheel well area, drivers side, but the paint is in good shape and the
interior is above average but not exceptional. All seats and such are
complete and it is much cleaner than the average bus.  I did not crawl
under it so can't tell you much about the undercarriage.  On the basis of
my quick look it appeared to be in above average condition  but YOMV.

The kid's name is Zack Berryman, 423-855-7403.  His mom's work number is
423-495-3557.  The usual disclaimers apply; I just saw it in a parking lot
and talked to him about it and promised to post it to the list. Please
contact him, not me.
