Subject: H4 headlights

I've often found a sets of h-4s in a junkyard 914s and similar cars.  They
are often overlooked, as the headlights are typically cranked closed.
Simply turn the manual headlight open knobs and check.  The last set I
found cost a whole 3 bucks!  Keep your eyes peeled for diamonds in the
rough...
