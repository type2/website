Subject: Re: joel's locator list

          alright now.  before evil, nasty rumors get started i want
          it known that lisa mazak and myself do not own the same '66
          kombi.  it is simply a weird and wonderful coincidence that
          we both have the best veedubs around and live in the same
          town.  there is one big difference in our vehicles however;
          as of last saturday mine has no motor attached, d'oh.  now
          back to the rumors: there have been reports of mutual beer
          sloshing between said parties.  will you accept &quot;no comment&quot;
          on this one?  interesting list joel.  hope you get bored
          more often.  very productive in that state , you are!  ray
