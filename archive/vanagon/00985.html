have you checked the solenoids on the carbs?

three in total - one on each carb - fuel cutoff
one bigger one on lefthand side carb for central idle system.

i've found that they can cause mischief, especially when
they work intermittantly.

only at night - does this suggest an electrical or supernatural
cause, or is that a redundant question?

my '72 westy - in the barn - selling it this summer
