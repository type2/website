Subject: Re: mystery hose (FUEL TANK)

Jim wanted to know, I think everyone could use the advice.
(clamps on fuel tank vent lines)

&gt; clamps, expecting a &quot;simple job&quot;, and then found that I cannot figure out
&gt; how the original clamps are loosened--got any suggestions?
&gt; Jim&gt;
&gt; 

Jim you pretty much got to cut them off, a big (8&quot; handle) set of 
quality electricians dikes (side cutters) will nip right through the 
OEM clamp at the point it is raised a bit to crimp, come off in a 
second, then cut the hose with a single sided razor blade so you 
don't break the barb off the tank.  I reccomend the simple spring 
clams when you put it back together as they are cheaper and easier 
than the screw on jobs and as there is no pressure here are more than 
sufficient.  You can use any ole American fuel line for the same 
reason.  A bit more advice, unfortunately you are only seeing the 
outer end hoses up on those tanks, one on each side attaches through 
the exact same type (and likely condition) hose to a steel tank line, 
the other to a little plastic valve thingy on the tank.  So the best 
real option is to drop your tank and replace ALL of them.  This is 
100% needed for the secondary reason that chances are on an '85 the 
top of the tank is near rusting through because dirt collects on them 
and holds water (like 1/2&quot; of mud on top of your tank likely).  
Removing is fairly straightforward and will take an afternoon.  
Siphon out all the gas, then with an extinguisher nearby, remove the 
fill hose from the body via 3 screws (The plastic surround twists off 
in a counter clockwise direction after screws out) remove the vent line from
the fill hose (1/2&quot; line slips on the plastic fill fitting), wiggle the 
big fill pipe into the tank another couple of inches and you should 
be able to then wiggle it down and clear out through the  wheelwell.  Cut 
all those vent line pieces you are replacing, then support the tank 
with something, unhook the rear lines to pump and return and plug, 
watch draining gas, drain it into a pan and dispose immediately.  
Remove 2 bolts from front of tank hanger straps, then wiggle the 
rears of the straps out of the frame member, carefully drop the tank 
(2 people).  A big vent line that goes over the front top from side 
to side (1/2&quot; ID or so) may be attached to the body with a conduit clamp 
sort of thing, it will pull out one end, observe how it is fitted and 
notice reinstalling it is a real SOB that must be done by feel 
through the tinny hole above the frame member in the wheelwell from 
each side.  Disconnect the tank sensor and then remove tank.  Plug 
all the holes scrub down well, degrease, hand wire brush, whatever.  
Paint carefully on top with at least Rustoleum in the can primer and 
topcoat.  Reassemble replacing all the vent hoses.  DO NOT FORGET TO 
REAATCH THE SENDER FIRST THING, removing about 2-3 hours first time 
installing faster as you know how, basic down time is paint drying.  
Vanagon tanks are very $$$$, your time is worth it.
