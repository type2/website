Subject: Heading to Colo.

Hello Group: Took a job in the South Eastern part of Colo. and I'm 
heading that way Sunday. Driving from Dallas, thinking about pulling a 
motorcycle trailer w/ my BMW GS on it. Anybody had any experance pulling 
a trailer with a 85 Westie?? I've never pulled anything with it so I 
don't feel go about doing it.  Thanks, Doc
