Subject: Vanagon Parts List !!

I got the Web page complete this weekend!  The url will change again
in a few weeks for now you can find it in one of our local sevice
providers at,

 http://www.scruznet_dot_com/~vwmaster

  Hope this list of prices helps everyone out I'm working very hard to
get the rest of the site up and runn ing also.  The Vanagon parts list
seemed to be the most important to do first, any VW part that you might
need is availible through Volks-Motorsports.
