&gt; Hi all.
&gt; Does anyone know of a good source for sheepskin seat covers (front), for
&gt; a '91 Westie? Thanks in advance,
&gt; Cris
&gt; '91 Westie (Trying to preserve its original upholstery)
&gt; '66 Kombi  (getting ready for Tierra del Fuego)
&gt; '67 Deluxe (parts car)

	I bought mine from L.L. Bean about 10 years ago for ~$75. I've used
	it in a couple Ford Escorts, a '91 Westy also and now in an '85 Weekender.

	It's real cozy and noticeably warmer on cold mornings.

	The only bugaroo is the elastic and velcro straps that wrap under
	the seat bottom get a little greasy from the seat runner lube, but it's
pretty
	minor. I wash the cover about once a year in cold H2O and Woolite.

	scr
