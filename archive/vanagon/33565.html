&gt; driving mine on the street. Its fine to keep it in as-new condition,
&gt; but I can't see the point of trailering a car around.
&gt;         My dad used to watch a guy in 944 turbo gingerly tip-toe over
&gt; the speed bumps and park diagonally across two spots far from anyone's
&gt; doors. His observation to me: &quot;The proper way to arrive in a 944 turbo is
&gt; *sideways*!&quot; I've gotta agree. We VW Bus types drive our favorites as
&gt; a matter of course, as it should be. This weeks Autoweek has a cover
&gt; story on the Ferrari F50. Two were delivered in Texas. One went into
&gt; a trailer immediately, the other was driven 115 (yes, 115) laps on
&gt; the local race track for the benefit of the new owner's friends in
&gt; the right seat. He then drove it home! My man!!

I agree with this thread.  When I was in the Model A Ford Club, I got to
serve as a judge at a car show.  This guy had a beautiful 29 Phaeton that
he trailered in.  Went up against a bunch of also nice cars that were
driven in.  I was impressed, until I saw that the sand castings on the
block and head had been sanded smooth before painting.  Fords were cheap
cars when built, so this was way over-restoration.  Needless to say, it
didn't take best of show.  I believe in driving the cars!

On the extreme, I met a lady once at a vintage car meet that had been
offered the chance to drive the Briggs-Cunningham Museum's (I don't know if
they're around anymore) Bugatti Royale (170&quot; wheelbase and 770 cubic inch
straight 8) around the block.  On surface streets in Costa Mesa!!!  Mind
you, at the time (around 1970), one of the *other* of the six Royale's in
existence had recently sold at an auction for something like 8 million
dollars!  She told me she declined the offer.
