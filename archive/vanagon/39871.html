Subject: 82 Westfalia Carpet

 Hi! And the usual, to the point. I need guidance about the carpet located
between the front seats and the back seat. It's approximately 6ft X 4ft.

 1. Besides the dealerships (at $400 I was told), are there any other
sources for this piece (brown)?

 2. If negative on #1, sources of automotive carpet would be appreciated.

 TIA.
