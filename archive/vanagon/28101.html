&gt;Hopefully, the front shocks for the 16&quot; version of the Vanagon would have

I can't see how the absorber could raise the height of the vehicle without
also changing the springs.  With the standard springs a longer shock would
just squish down more since it doesn't actually carry the load of the
vehicle, but just &quot;absorbs&quot; bouncing motions.  A longer shock might even
bottom out when squished to the shorter ride height.
