&gt;we'll talk more about this at the NC Vw campout this weekend! hope to
&gt;see you there!

Very, but North Carolina is just a little too far to make in a weekend.  I
looked on the map to make sure.  How about a campout in Tennessee or
Alabama somewhere so some of us Texans could conceivably make it?  I really
miss camping!
