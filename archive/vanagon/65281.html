&gt;I've heard this tip before   but can't get it to work
&gt;is the tube actually inside the tube    or do you just pull on the tube
&gt;or do not all of us have the extention tube

ALL Vanagons should have the oil tube extension. when you remove the oil
filler cap, you should be able to feel the lip of the slide-out extension
... it's the top 1/8&quot;.

by the by, for all you old-busers with 1980-1981 Vanagons, with the oil
cap that does NOT have the word &quot;OIL&quot; on it, you can still get the newer
&quot;OIL&quot;-labeled cap from the dealers. about $8. :)
