Subject: Jerome Jamboree Report

Bottom line: &quot;Wunnerful~a~wunnerful!&quot; *Excellent weekend!*

On Friday I tried to sneak away from the job after a measley eight hours.
Honk!, per the usual, some hoser scheduled a late Friday interview in which
I had to sit... and sit etc. I dinged the candidate and bailed on home (heh).

Friday night:
After a billion stops, Paula and I were able to crawl out of Phoenix by 9PM.
One of the last stops was the local Safeway super market. The neighborhood
is &quot;nice enough&quot; to be blessed with rent a cops in the parking lots. I guess
a rash of Ding-dong jackings or something... I noticed that an overly
attentive guard was hovering around us as we loaded the hoards of ice,
enough beer for a Ray Milland weekend, and some real groceries into the
Vanagon.  Kiddingly, I asked &quot;Moojibur&quot; if he wanted to come with us. (It
was a velvet hammer way of asking for space and I was just being a wiseguy).
The guy proceeds to go off saying that he gets off work at 6AM and would we
wait? He then started in on the life story starting at day one. &quot;Uh, OK
dude, Like can we stay with your family until you get off work? No? well
maybe next time... He responds with requests for pen and paper in order to
give the phone number etc. Um, sorry pal fresh out. It sounds like we were
rude but trust me, I handled it like a softie.
WE FINALLY crawled up the hills to Jerome. Our intent was to arrive Friday
night in order to help with the arrivals of the caravan crazies who would
arrive sometime Saturday morning. When we rolled in fresh as a flower at
midnight, were simply dumbfounded to find nearly 35 buses already camped! Of
course we made no secret of wanting to get a good camp spot this year. At
the last two Jamborees, we had the privelage of randomly picking the spot
next to the loud folks two years in a row. All worked out and a dry high
ground spot was decided on. We were supposed to find &quot;Buckwilde&quot;, his Mrs.,
and cutie baldie baby with the pretty eyes. Dark is an understatement mixed
with quasi-fog, we gave up and just parked. The tent was pitched and we
crashed in total exhaustion. 
Sprinkles turned to all out havoc at 5AM. It rained and boomed thunder and
flashed lightning right over head so hard that it rocked the bus. The whole
campground was wide awake and howling with amazing cheers.
Saturday:
Muddy and coolish to the Phoenix crowd. (Hurray!) A steady stream of
vehicles continuously poured into the event all day long. 26 clubs (not
counting Thom's favorite SOTO) were in attendance from AZ, Cali, NM, TX, CO
and other parts unknown. It was a great mixture of all ages and models of
VWs. Lots of them! It was packed. Snivel kids and Grand folks alike. Special
thanks to the Box on Wheels, VTO~Vintage Transporters Owners from
California, The NM Route 66 Splits, and &quot;Great&quot; Dane Dawson from El Paso.
Long distance was from extreme NorCal or S. Oregon &lt;specific for this
event&gt;. A couple of Beavis and Butthead types drove from SanFrancisco in a
'65 Type I totally unprepared for camping. They sat there saying &quot;Dude&quot; alot
and talking about where to sleep and how to eat. We took pity and fed the
pigeons all weekend. (Being a former pigeon, I understand).
The Chili Contest was won by &quot;Cherry VanBondo&quot;! Her Machaca beef &quot;Chalupa&quot;
was killer but not killer hot. A combo of her good cooking and my &quot;Come to
Jesus&quot; invitation for votes. =) I supose I could preach if I wasn't so warped.
Proper amounts of campfires and fun was had by all Saturday evening. We
shared our fire and conversation with Mr.and Mrs. John Kyte from the
Vintagvw &quot;aircooled&quot; list. Several real &quot;characters&quot; also popped in and out.
heh, heh, heh.
Sunday:
The Celebrity Auction was held. An original autographed VanBondo cartoon
fetched $20.00, a mystery package from Paul Newman went for a wild $150.00.
It ended up being an autographed T-shirt for Newman's Best. The Celeb Aution
alone raised over $1000.00 for the Foundation for Burns and Trauma's &quot;Camp
Courage.&quot; Contact Arizona Bus Club President, Jon S. &lt;during polite hours
MST&gt; at (602)877-8662 if you wish to send in a late tax deductible &quot;bid.&quot;
An extensive raffle was held through out Saturday and Sunday. The big prize
went to a very very stoked young kid who was a longtime wannabusser. For
$50.00 in raffle tickets he drove home in his '59 7-door panel bus. He had
failed to win a thing for his efforts up until the big one. Way to go! It
had been a long time since I had seen anyone that genuinely excited about
their luck! =) It might be BS &lt;bus story&gt; but word that a barndoor might be
raffled next year. I will advise accordingly. If not, Im sure that the club
will come up with a nice alternative.
Dyer Lytle, Buckwilde, John Kyte and several others from the lists were at
the meet! Maybe next year you can join us!
