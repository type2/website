Subject: newly installed engine won't turn

This is on a '72.  I managed to put a valve through my piston so I was
afforded the oppportunity to put a new engine in.  I got a 2000cc from a '78. 
I took the fly wheel of of the '72 (1700cc) and put it on the 2000 cc. And put
it in with minimal trouble.  I tried to turn it over tonight and it seems to
have jammed on something. You can hear the starter work but nothing happening.
 Now I can not even turn it over by hand.  Please help me make this nightmare
end.  Any Idea what's up? Please E- mail me directly. 
Thank you
 david
