Subject: Parts for sale in P.R. (again)

Hi investors in VW precious metal! Several days ago I mentioned the possi-
bility of getting Vanagon parts from Puerto Rico. I talked to the guy (PU
(PUCHO) today and he told me that he's able to send parts to U.S. via UPS
(C.O.D.s accepted). Pucho is a reliable guy who knows a lot about Vanagons.
He has in stock complete engines, trannies, windows, windshields and other
interior parts. To contact him call (809) 265-7901 in the evening. Expe
