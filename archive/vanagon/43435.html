&gt;        I have a real basic question regarding what weight oil to use in my
&gt;1990 Westy.  Reviewed the owners manual and found that SAE 15W-50 and SAE
&gt;15W-40 were recommended for temperatures 10 degree F to 90 degree F, while
&gt;SAE 10W-30 and 10W-40 were recommended from 0=B0F to 60=B0F.   Just
wonderin=
&gt;g
&gt;if most people on the list who live in climates with wide temperature
&gt;differences are switching the weights of their oil for different seasons or
&gt;what?  Also these 15W-50 and 15W-40 are pretty thick oils and I have never
&gt;had to use this weight in any vehicle I have every owned.  Welcome any
&gt;comments on this issue.
&gt;
&gt;

Most european engines still recomend the higher viscosity oils.  The Vanagon
engine runs exteremely hot and places a lot of shear stress on the oil.  The
bearings are also not as tight a tolarance as amrican engines and this also
increases the need for increased viscosity.  Summer operation calls for
20-50.  The owners manual actually calls for straight 40 in temps above 90F.
 I think this may be too much.  Use the chart in the manual.  Modern oils and
especially synthetics allow for a much wider temp range.  I use Mobil 1 15-50
all year in NY.  Mobil claims it is good down to -35 or so.  10-30 does tend
to have oil pressure problems in hot weather and high speed driving. Avoid
using it.  Never use 5-30 unless in artic conditions.  15-40 oil is used by
many fleets as it is an outstanding all year compromise.  These fleet oils
usually have superior additive packages and are especially suited to diesels.
 Hope some of this helps.

Dennis.
