Hey Matt

I bought my 83.5 westie waterboxer in may of last year with 86000 miles on it
for $5000, it was all in good shape except for low pressure in #3, like
yours.  
Some things to think about:  
   I also purchased my beloved VW for post-graduation traveling and after
having lived out of it on and off for a year and a half have pretty much
managed to degrade the interior of the van through heavy handed use, don't
get me wrong I love it do death, but if you're like me and kind of a clutz
many of those plastic 13 year old german parts wont last too long.  The
kicker is that in all that post-graduation traveling, I have managed to drive
it pretty hard and haven't always been in the best location for the proper
care that my van has been needing, the result-&gt; my pressure has dropped more
in both 1&amp;3 and I think I am in for more trouble.

The moral is, traveling is defined by motion which in this day and age
requires internal combustion, make sure you got a reliable engine so you can
go anywhere you want, missing handles, a warm fridge, no water in the sink or
any of that stuff will keep you stuck like a motor that needs rebuilding.

Good luck, mike d
