Hi Sean et al

I just ordered my '68-'79 book, direct from Bentley, for $34.95 + $4.95
shipping.  When I got my '61-6? Type I manual, it was about $92 from Bentley
and $70+ from JC Whitney.  The tradeoff was that I had to wait about 8
weeks until Whitney got it in stock...

I didn't call JC's this time, but they might be cheaper if you feel like
a (possible) wait...

	N-Joy!

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 	I've been seeing on this list that the Bentley books for the VW
&gt; 	Vanagons and Westys (1980 and up) are around $70.  Are the
&gt; 	Bentley books for the older buses, like the '68-'79 book, that
&gt; 	expensive?  Seems like a lot for that book, but I guess if you
&gt; 	need one you need one.  
&gt; 
&gt; 	Hopin' older is cheaper,
&gt; 	Sean
