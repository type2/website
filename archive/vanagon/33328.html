Subject: Re: Idiot Factor


&gt;Somehow no-one was hurt, and upon re-connecting the cables + to + and
&gt;- to -, both cars still started.  I did get a little weak in the knees
&gt;though, upon reflecting on the fact that there were probably 500 amps
&gt;of current going through those wires, and I was clipping them on and
&gt;off with my bare hands.

&gt;Whoever heard of installing a red wire on a ground connection?!

&gt;-Rodney

Actually, my bus has the red cable going to ground and the black is positive.
I don't know if this is the stock set up, but it looks like it is.
