Not on purpose, methinks, but a while ago I was driving across Kansas
and, uh, kinda speeding, along with this guy in a Celica.  He had one
of the magnetic mount antennas which fell over at about 80 mph and was
lying horizontally on his rear window.  We continued to talk on the radio 
without any apparent decrease in signal quality.  Of course, we were 
relatively close together.  And no, I wasn't driving my van.  :)
