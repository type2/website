&gt;&gt; What's the availability of the type 3 pickup trucks?  What are they going
&gt;&gt; for?  Is there a list for them anywhere?

&gt;Do you mean Type II pickups?  The van cab and a bed in the back with fold 
&gt;up sides?  If so you need the vanagon list you sent to.  Handles all four 
&gt;generations of the transporter - van, station wagon, camper, and trucks.
&gt;
&gt;Generations have a T# as well
&gt;Type II T1 - Microbus to 1968
&gt;Type II T2 - Bus to ~1977
&gt;Type II T3 - Vanagon to ~1991
&gt;Type II T4 - Eurovan current
&gt;
&gt;Type III is a fastback, squareback and notchback that was supposed to 
&gt;replace the beetle.
&gt;
&gt;These are a part of the Vintagvw (and aircldvw) lists.

Yes, I did mean type II.  I've been looking around and just haven't seen
many of the trucks lately, either on the road, in the graveyards of the
mechanic shops, or even in the magazines.  Have they all rotted away?

102F outside.(I-40 west of Nashville)
