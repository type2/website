Subject:      Re: Hubcovers wanted: ME TOO

I need a couple of those Wheel Covers too.  Let me know if someone knows
where I can get 'em.


&gt;I'm in need of another one of those silver &quot;spoked&quot; plastic hubcaps with
&gt;the VW emblem in the center.  If anyone has one please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Bryan
