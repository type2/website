Subject: Gas Tank Conversion - step 1

Howdy,

	Tonight I got the gas tanks side by side and started sizing up what I 
wanted to do.  Being the type that makes things harder than they have to 
be, I decided I wanted to use the original gas cap, instead of the larger,
later one.   So I cut the end of the filler neck on the early tank and
the one off the new tank, and MIG welded the early cap-holder to the 
late neck.  I tested it by putting on the gas cap and filling the neck 
(which is a separate piece, remember) with water.  I got a little seepage
in a couple of places in my welds, but I got way more leakage thru the
cap, so I'll stop there.

	If I feel brave tomorrow, I'll pull the engine and do the welding
I've been putting off, and then try to wedge the tank in.  I did make one
major mistake, though:  I forgot to get the straps that hold the tank
down.  D'oh!  Either I havta fab something, or schlepp back out to the
junkyard to get them...
