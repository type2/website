Subject:      Arizona bus club?

Does anyone in this mailing list belong to the arizona bus club? If so please
contact me, I am interested in joining your club. I have a real nice 81
vanagon L . It needs friends badly. It is lonesome. I want it to be happy
again , know what I mean? Anyway.. My family does'nt want it around, it is
ugly and unwanted by all , except me of course. I am fairly new to phoenix
and frankly have found it boring as hell, not to mention hot as hell. I would
like to meet others with the same interests as mine. Camping and cruisin'
around in a caravan of vw busses is my Idea of heaven. So come on and help a
fella' out Ok? Maybe I'll change my mind about Phoenix? I know my vanagon
will be happy.
