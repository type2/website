Subject: Buy of the day

Wow I just picked up a Bentley for 1980 - 1991 vanagons for $15.00 at a
local freight salvage place.  It was the only one there I could find. Brand
new.  Made my day.   I did see a 1985 Sirroco, Jetta bentley if any one is
interested.  Also I think I saw a Muir for Jettas or something like that.  I
could pick these up if anyone so desires.  I will look for more vanagon
bentleys next time. 

They also had two VW type mufflers.  they were not vanagons but
maybe a type 2 or bug.  They were Kadrons,  I saw a date 1/78 and it
said VW sedan.  There were two outlets for the exhaust about a foot
apart and had two very small heat exchanger type structures.  Any one
interested in these and I could find out more info.   Probably pretty cheap.

Have a great Friday.
