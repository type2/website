&gt;&gt;Okay, so it's dangerous if the flame were to go out while driving.  Is
&gt;&gt;it not also dangerous for the flame to go out while you are camped,
&gt;&gt;sleeping, during a storm?  I guess anything with gas and a flame is
&gt;&gt;relatively dangerous, driving or not.  One solution would be to get a
&gt;&gt;warning device that detects a gas leak, or lack of oxygen.  But if there
&gt;&gt;are so many risks, why are there so many three-way fridges in RVs?
&gt;&gt;Actually, a gas leak while driving is probably *less* serious than when
&gt;&gt;parked.  Why?  Because there is likely to be air moving through the
&gt;&gt;vehicle which will help disperse the gas, as opposed to it filling up
&gt;&gt;the inside of the van.  Comments?

&gt;Isn't there a safety device in there by which if the flame goes out then
&gt;the gas supply is cut? Thought I read that in the manual.

&gt;I have seen a propane barbecue tank catch fire: it's very much like the 2nd
&gt;world war flame throwers without the 'off' switch.
     (snip)
&gt;It seems to me there's a worst-case-scenario here that's far deadlier than
&gt;is the pleasure of a slightly colder beer.


This thread is enough to make me swear off any and all propane
appliances forever. And I don't even have any experience with them!
(Maybe that's why?)

Gimme my Igloo ice chest any day over those propane-powered tactical
muclear devices. More capacity; colder; lower operating costs; more
reliable; FAR more predictable; &quot;fuel&quot; is available at any liquor store,
grocery store, or 7-11, and can put out fires instead of causing them;
and portable to boot! At least, portability proportional to size and
content, and to your physical similarity to Shaq or Hulk.


Sorry for the dump. But, holy moley, these things sound like
original equipment on a Yugo. Can't you guys/gals say anything NICE
about them? VW/Westy had to have SOME reason to include them in their
camper &quot;upgrade&quot;.

(Now turning down flame, partly for fear of propane explosion :) )
