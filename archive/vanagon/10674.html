Ok, I might be ill-informed, but what is a T2 Kombi? I think 
I know what a T1 Kombi is, but the T2's were Station Wagons,
Campmobiles, Sunrooves, and a few Pickups -- come to think of
it, I don't think I've seen a T2 panel for that manner.

Are there such things which weren't common in the US or is
this transferring T1 nomenclature to T2 busses?
