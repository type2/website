Subject: June Bug Jamboree / Doh!

The June Bug Jamboree flyers are finally in the mail.  I see that I 
screwed up the directions to the show site (well, it was 3 am when I 
wrote 'em).  Exit 80-A on I-44 is correct, but it exits onto Business 
Loop 44 (not Bus. 65).  It's still Glenstone Ave., no matter what you 
call it.  Hope to see some of you there!
