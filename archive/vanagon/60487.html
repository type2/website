Subject: Fire Prevention

Thanks to the warnings posted awhile back, a suspicious odor prompted me
to immediately check down under where I discovered a seeping fuel line.
This hummer, left alone, could easily ruined my whole day if it had
caused a fire. Consider this yet another warning, fellow Vanites and
check yours out. One thing about it, access could'nt be easier.
