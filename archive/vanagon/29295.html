Subject: Re: sliding door handle screw


BrianI,

When you install the new screw for your sliding door handle,
make sure you use some LocTight or ThreadLoc or whatever it's
called on the screw's threads. This will keep the handle from
working the new screw loose. I did this, back in June and the 
handle hasn't come loose since. 
Caution, use the stuff that can be undone without heat, never
know when you'll have to remove that handle.

Good luck,
