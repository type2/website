Yes, I did it a couple of months ago.  You should be able to find a post
from me that said a little about it in the archives.
 
&gt; I don't get it... since the rods are somewhat pressed
&gt; into each other, and there is no nice way to disassemble
&gt; them (that I can think of... if I had access to a machine
&gt; shop I could make a puller but...), they have to be hammered
&gt; off, a little on each side, which inevitably leads to twisting
&gt; them around the crank a little bit.  After that it's hard to 
&gt; imagine the plastigage meaning much.  Mine is just a smear.  
&gt; Suggestions?

Hmmm... I didn't have to hammer mine to get them apart.  Tap them
gently, yes.  Don't know of a solution to this problem.  New rod bolts
maybe?
 
&gt; On my rods, once the bolts are tightened
&gt; a bit it's no longer trivial to get a socket on at least one
&gt; of the bolts on each rod.  I had to more-or-less hammer
&gt; a socket onto each rod bolt while disassembling the engine,
&gt; so I guess it shouldn't surprise me.

&gt; Should I go buy a little drill-mounted grinding wheel
&gt; and grind away around the bolts?  That's a little scary... 
&gt; or has anyone had this problem and found a socket with 
&gt; narrower walls?  Mine don't seem all that excessively beefy.

You need a thinner socket.  Rather then grind on the rods, which could
lead to all kinds of trouble, I would go to Sears and get a Craftsman
socket.  They tend to have real thin walls which make them fit in places
other sockets won't.  If yours is already a Craftsman, then I guess I
would take the rods to a machine shop and let *them* do the grinding.  :)

It was difficult to hold the crank and rod still while I tightened and
untightened the rod bolts.  Helps to have an extra set of hands.  After
a few tries, though, I was convinced that I was doing it well enough to
get accurate information.  Keep trying...
