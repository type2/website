Subject: 81 Westy (air-cooled) Exhaust System

Help! The exhaust system on my Westy is toast, and the system from VW is
very expensive. In fact, VW cannot even supply the crossover pipe any
longer. The systems in the after-market catalogs do not include the
catalytic converter or the EGR filter connector. I've installed a muffler
without the cat. conv. and blocked off the EGR filter for now, but may not
pass Texas's new emission control standards when the time comes. Any
guideance will be much appreciated, not just by me but probably every 80-83
brick-owner out here.

Thanks,
Mick
