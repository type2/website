&gt; I'll give you folks the planned route for the trip.  Any suggestions on 
&gt; things to bring/see/do/avoid/etc. would be great.  We want to stay off 
&gt; interstates as much as possible.  We're both into pop culture stuff, so 
&gt; any 80 foot brontosauruses (already been to Wall, SD) or 
&gt; World's-Largest-Perogy-On-A-Fork tips would be appreciated.  
&gt; Any 'must sees'?  Any thoughts/comments/sugestions/etc. would be helpful.

The October 94 National Geographic's cover story is &quot;Our National Parks&quot;.
Looks to have some good information in it.  Also, the Aug. 94 Readers
Digest has an article on &quot;Six Great Vacation Drives&quot;, two of which are
close to your route.  Check them out!  I'm always looking for sources of
information to use in planning the May'95 &quot;Bricks Across America&quot; tour, so
if you feel like sharing details of your trip, both before and after, I
(and I'm sure the rest of the list too) would be really interested!
&gt; 
&gt; Something I was thinking about related to this trip: is there a list of 
&gt; good (non-dealer) VW specialist shops around?  The dealers are way too 
&gt; $$$ for me.  Maybe it would be a good idea to get a state by state (prov 
&gt; by prov) list of such places together for this list, as a faq or 
&gt; something.  It'd sure be nice to know of a good place to go if you 
&gt; encounter problems on a trip.  Thoughts?

Well, I can supply you with information for San Diego.  If you want, contact
me directly when you get here - my phone # is (619) 469-8894.  We can all
go out to dinner and talk about Joel, Thom, Ric, Martha, etc.  :)
