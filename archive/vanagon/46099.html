Subject: Re: 78 bus making strange sounds at star

(To David Schimpf, regarding Van not driven since &quot;91, with noise at startup:

I have 78 Westie.  The clatter at startup are the hydraulic lifters, which
will allow a lot of valve to Pushrod play until they are full of oil.  Did
you change the oil in this &quot;not driven since 91&quot; bus?  The oil may be very
thick, not allowing pumping up of the lifters until oil is thinner- Any
time my bus stands over 3 days I get ther clatter, sometimes one lifter
will not pump up for 6 miles!  The noise climbing a hill is probably
&quot;pinging&quot; due to the rather high compression (165??).  Was this engine ever
rebuilt (heads)?  Like oversize cylinders or anything that would change the
combustion volume?  If not, I suspect there may be carbon or some sort of
deposits in the top of the head or on the piston that is reducing the
volume of the combustion chamber, thus raising compression.  An inspection
inside the chamber via the spark plug holes may help. In fact, don't buy it
until you try to pull ALL the plugs, to make sure plug holes are not
stripping from carbon deposits on end of plug, which happens if wrong
length plugs were used.  Stripped plug holes involve a head teardown and
inserts put in, so check &quot;em now!  Memorize the angle of the plug
wrench/extension, so you can rethread plugs, #2 is especially hard and
easiest to do via the access port in rear of vehicle floor.  Make sure you
have locking extensions and rubber plug gripper in socket (SEARS); I've
dropped the socket into the shrouding before getting locking ones...
