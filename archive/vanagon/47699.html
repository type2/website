Subject: Re: More 83.5 Vanagon Cooling

&lt;&lt; I appreciate the suggestions for helping get this van to cool 
properly...&gt;&gt;

We have a cranky '83 that did the same thing for over a YEAR.  We 
learned to cope with the overheating at lights -- racing the engine a 
bit, making sure we don't drive anywhere where we have to stop, you 
know...

We finally put it in the shop, and it took them over a WEEK to go 
through the list of possibilities.  

It turned out to be the rear Bypass valve at the top of the engine.

It had broken and &quot;rigged&quot; by my husband over a year ago.

It's so small, if it clogs, or malfunctions, it won't help any to flush 
out the engine.  

It was a quick, cheap repair, and the bus hasn't overheated since.  It's 
a joy to drive.

Good luck.

Nancy
