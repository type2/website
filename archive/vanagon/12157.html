sam:

first of all what you have is an eberspacher not ebersparker.

secondly, don't cut away the sheet metal eeeeek! the eberspacher will fit
underneath the spare tire cutout in the back section of the van, no need to
cut out the spare tire holder. if you are looking at the engine, the heater
(assuming it was the one designed for the bus)  should fit under the spare
tire holder on the &quot;drivers side&quot; of the engine. One thing you should
determine is that the darned thing is working before going to all of the
plumbing to fit it in. those gas heaters are a bit of a pain in the but to
work on in those cramped quarters.

thirdly, did you get all of the sheet metal and control knobs, cabling etc.
for the heater? basically the heater will be routed via ductwork through
the firewall into the back of the van via some metal plumbing that is a bit
of a pain in the _at_#$%_at_!! to fit in.

fourthly, the only hole that will need to be cut is behind the spare tire
carrier in the metal pillar behind the rear window. There is a 2&quot; x 2&quot;
piece of mesh metal that fits into there. It is kind of a &quot;cold air return&quot;
(i think) that will grab the air from the cab to recirculate or something
like that in the heater. As with all gas. powered heaters etc., keep the
window open a tad so you can get some &quot;real&quot; in there and not gas yourself
out.

fifthly, although gas heaters perform a fairly simple function, they are
kind of complicated to work on, and because they run on gas, can catch fire
if they have been fiddled with incorrectly etc.

There is a fellow in Colorado i think, called JB or JV's heater service. He
works on old Stewart Warners and Eberspachers. You might want to make sure
the thing is in good working order before trying to install the beast! Not
an endorsement, just passing along what info i know of.

&gt;At the Palo Alto swapmeet Yesterday .I got myself a good working ebersparker.
&gt;But there is a problem.
&gt;
&gt;The westie has a spare wheel well just where the heater is meant to go.  Does
&gt;one just cut away at the bottom of the spare wheel well and put the spare
&gt;wheel on the front of the bus. Shoud the cut-off wheel well be filled with
&gt;plywood say 1/2 &quot; thick or a piece of pop-riveted sheet metal.
&gt;
&gt;Should the heater connect to the regular heater so that is works as a
&gt;defroster and everything or should the heat just get into the bus under the
&gt;rear seat?
&gt;
&gt;Tks for any help.
&gt;sam williams
&gt;
&gt;hope to see you at red rock canyon.
&gt;
&gt;will it be cold there or can I forget the heater till next year?
