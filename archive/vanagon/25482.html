Subject: re: LEAF (Lake Eden Arts Festival)

hey now,

duh, LEAF is near Black Mountain, North Carolina nestled in the mountains about
25-30 minutes east of asheville. make that 40-50 in a vw bus. :-) Take I-40
to Black Mountain, north into town, turn left at second light (US 70 west), go
1.4 miles to second light and turn right at &quot;Ice Serive Store&quot;. Left at STOP
sign, proceed about 1.6 miles to light then right on LAKE EDEN ROAD. Main gate
is 1.5 miles on left. if ya get LOST...ask for CAMP ROCKMOUNT.

heheh,

jonathan
