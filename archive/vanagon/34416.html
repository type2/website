Subject: Glow Plug &amp; Batman Split

An ex-Busser Friend came across some NOS in his shop including a VW 
glow plug for a gas heater. If you need one I can put you in contact 
with him. This guy also has just about every toy VW bus that was produced in the 
60's and 70's including a Batman VW split with action figures, 
unfortunately none is for sale but he would be willing to trade for a 
Syncro Westy.
BTW if you are not familiar with the 81' model Westfalia I have 
uploaded photo's to my home page, It's for sale.
