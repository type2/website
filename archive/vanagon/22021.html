Can anyone help me?  My parking sticker went down the window.  Is there any
eas
y way to access the window wall?  What holds the interior panel to the
exterior
 door?  I can see the two screws that hold on the armrest, but how do I get
the
crank handle for the window off and does it just come off around the door
handl
e?  Any help that anyone can give would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Sounds like you want to pull the door panel?  (This applys to Rabbits too, and
probably is common to all VWs.)

Remove arm rest, 2 big phillips head screws.  Remove it and set it aside.


Remove window winder - pry up the plastic cover and find the phillips head
screw in the center of the end opposit the know you hold to wind the winder. 
Once the screw is out, the winder pulls straight off a spined shaft.  Note the
position of the winder before you take it off.  If the glass is fully up, what
&quot;0'clock&quot; is the winder at?  Remove it and set it aside.

Remove the trim and &quot;cup&quot; around/under the door release handle.  The cup under
the handle has a tab at one end, and so if you gently pry at the correcte end
(I think it is the back end) it can be removed.  Under it is a phillips head
screw to remove.  Then the trim comes out.   Remove it and set it aside.

Remove the door panel.  It is held in place with plastic barbed &quot;nails&quot;.   The
head of the nail is fixed through a hole under the vinyl panel covering and
can be left undisturbed.  The barbbed shank goes through a matching hole in
the door.  Try a thin wooden flat stick (maybe a paint stirring stick - you
may have to sand a &quot;chisel edge&quot; on it) and slide it between the door and the
panel.  If you feel along the edge of the panel, you can usually locate the
&quot;nail&quot; heads by feel.  You insert your stick kinda midway between two nails
and then slide it as close to one as it will go.  Find, get, make some kind of
flat hooked tool, like a miniature wrecking bar (I have one from Sears, it is
about 6&quot; long, 1/2&quot; wide, perhaps 1/16&quot; thick and literally is a mineature
wrecking bar) to use.  Insert this into the gap that the wooden stick has
made, and again move it as close the the &quot;nail&quot; head as possible and pull
straght out from the door.  The barbed shaft should pull free from the door. 
It is usually a pretty firm =&gt; hard pull.  Be ready for it to pop free so you
can release the tension, if you don't, you could break the masonite backing of
the panel.  Do this all the way around the perimiter of the panel, remove it
and set it aside.

Remove the plastic sheet under the door trim panel.  Be very careful here!! 
This plastic streatches and tears pretty easily.  You want to take it off and
preserve it's original shape and condition as much as possible.  This is what
stops water that has run down the glass from the outside and drained into the
inside of the door from getting into the interior of your van!!!!  The plastic
is just taped in place with double sided tape.  Carefully remove it and fold
it back out of your way.  For your purposes, to retrieve a dropped sticker,
you probably only have to partially remove it to get access through one of the
holes in the sheet metal of the door.  Remember when you put it back that
water will splash from the inside of the door through the holes in the
sheetmetal onto this piece of plastic and then run down the inside surface of
this plastic.  If you don't seal it up again as originally done, water will
leak out from the bottom of this piece of plastic under the edge of the vinyl
door panel and into your van!!

Assembly is the reverse of disassembly.  YMMV
