Subject: Re: Towing a Syncro, final Q?

Here's the quote from my '86 Syncro Supplement:

=====================================================================
Emergency towing by commercial tow truck

In case the vehicle needs to be towed by a commercial tow truck with
either front or rear wheels off the ground, make sure the off-ground
wheels can rotale [sic] freely.

If the off-ground wheels cannot rotate freely, the vehicle must be
transported on a flat bed.

The differential lock must not be engaged.
=====================================================================

This is on page 16 of &quot;Insert for Owner's Manual  Syncro Model  1986
Vanagon/Transporter&quot;.

Apparently VWoA thought it was appropriate back in the first year of
Syncros to allow towing with either front or rear wheels on the ground
as long as the wheels could spin.  I'd assume that the caveat about the
diff lock only applies if the affected axle is on the ground.  I know
that this is at odds with other reponses on this subject, so I would
also suspect that VWoA changed this section for later years.

&gt;  Anyone see any reason why a Syncro couldn't be hauled in the older style
&gt;  sling type tow truck, front up high, wheels spinning freely in the breeze,
&gt;  driven by the viscous coupling?  Just a thought for those little
&gt;  emergencies.  tim

&gt;  This should be okay for short distances.  Be advised that this type of pick
&gt; up will damaage the front bumper and it does put undue strain on the front
&gt; end where the lift chains are attached.
