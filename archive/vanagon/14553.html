Subject: Re: Sliding door tracks.

Im sorry I have not been able to answer this thread for a 
couple of days. (Its terrible when your job gets in the
way of your hobbies!!)

I have replaced and greased about four sets of these roller
guides, particularly the one on the bottom, and sometimes
the one in the middle.

My advice: Spend the extra $2.00 and get the tub of trailer
wheel bearing grease. It is sold next to the regular
wheel bearing grease, but is much more resistant
to salt water. I have used the regular in the middle and the
salt resistant on the bottom, and the stuff on the bottom
is still cleaner than the stuff in the middle. Its only
$2.00 more, but the stuff works like a charm. I dont buy
anything else right now.

Be sparing with the grease on the top track. It does not
carry any load, and you dont want to get it on yourself
when getting in and out.

Good luck.
