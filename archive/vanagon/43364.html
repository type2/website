Subject: Joys of a Bus, Mermen Itinerary through July

	The band I'm in broke up and we're hauling our stuff out of the
rehearsal space- so I'm helping the keyboard player (I play bass) and
as we're motoring along in Little Martha, somebody passes us and 
waves. Suddnely, this guy who drives only RX7s and turbo SAABs,
understands why I wanted a VW pickup! He says &quot;If you're driving one
of these you're either a mechanic or a poet- either you don't know
what you've gotten yourself into or you enjoy every minute&quot;.
