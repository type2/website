Subject: 2.0 motor, auto tranny for sale, best offer.

In PGH, PA:

Greetings.  I'm buying a 1981 Vanagon for the body (got a 1982 Westy that either
needs a new front clip, or everything swapped over).  Anyway, I'm stripping all
the good bits off the plain-jane Vanagon, including a running 2.0 motor.  Accord-
ing to the previous owner, it just suddenly &quot;lost power&quot;, so he parked it.  It
currently has no exhaust system, and he wants his dual Baby Dellortos back.  All
the fuel injection bits are in a box, but unless you really need them, I'd rather
hang onto them for spares for my 1982.

At the very worst, the 2.0 is good for core.  I suspect it might just need to be
tuned up (it's got recent heads, and only about 50,000 miles on it).

Also, I have the automatic transmission from the van that I don't need.  Again,
I know little about it, except that it was allegedly working when parked about
1.5 years ago.  Also around 50,000 miles.

Anyway, I was going to haul these to the BugOut in May and try to hawk them there,
but I'd rather not have to tote them that far.  So if anyone's interested in
either of these items, respond with an offer.  I do not want to get involved 
with packing and shipping, so if you want it, you gots to come get it.

Also, the seats will be for sale, doors and glass (except the windshield and
front passenger door), etc.

Thanks,
--Dale
