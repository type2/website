&gt;Just for us curious what are the details of your FI system.
&gt;Is it C.A.R.B. approved (like the Allyson ignition)?
&gt;Is it programable? How? Laptop?
&gt;When it runs how is your power and MPG?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

 Chris,

Well, I think you've missed a couple of my latest posts.  It's not running
at all right now.  I wish I could tell you more myself.  But here are the
basics;

Haltech F7b system from Gene Berg Enterprises, along with the rest of the 78
X 90.5 engine kit.  TWM throttle bodies with Porsche type '201', O-ring top
and bottom, injectors.  I used the pump and regulator from my old 1971 type
III system that I'd squirreled away.

It is programable from any PC type computer with the serial port, I have
been using a older portable 386 with an inverter since it doesn't run on
batteries, and it was free to me.

When it was running it felt really good, but since this a new engine I
resisted all temptation to rev it up and jam.  I was concientiously keeping
under 65, and under 4000 rpm, in spite of all my usual bad habits.  After
one day and about 175 miles on the road, something goofy went wrong and I
had to tow it home, that's where I am today.  I still haven't found the
problem, the injectors check out, so does the computer, sensors, ignition,
pump and regulator, fooey.

C.A.R.B.?  I'm guessing Canadian Air Resources Board, gee, I have no idea,
but I doubt it.  Programables would never pass, I'm sure you would need one
that is locked in.  Berg has talked about an 'E' Haltech model that he is
trying to get approved by California emissions, it is locked in on the O2
sensor.  Mine doesn't include the O2 sensor at all, unfortunately for me.  I
am hoping to someday trade it in on one that would be approved, though I'm
not sure my engine size would qualify even if it was an approved system.

Zat help?

Eug,
