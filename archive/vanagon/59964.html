&gt;right?

If the leaks aren't severe, you can get away with just replacing the
o-rings.  My wife's Honda apparently destroyed the compressor, leaving
the system wide open.  How the technician explained it to me is that
moisture gets into the system and &quot;corrosion&quot; develops in the 
condenser and evaporator.

If your system has small/slow leaks, i.e. from old o-rings or old
hoses, you should be able to replace them and recharge the system
and be OK.  I'm not sure how many o-rings there are on a vanagon,
but there would be one at the end of each hose.  At least six on
a typical AC system. (2 _at_ compressor, 2 _at_ condenser...)

AC systems are definitely one area that needs constant maintenance and
attention (especial when they get older) I order to run right.  Getting
small leaks fixed could end up being cheaper in the long run instead
of having to recharge the system every spring. (Especially at the cost
of freon these days)  

I'm definitely going to switch to R-134 if and when my compressor fails,
(Which means replacing the entire system as it has been explained to
me) as I intend to keep the van as long as possible.

Have it atleast check out.  I bet you just have some small leaks from
your o-rings.  

I hope this helps,
Sebastian Hill
