Subject: Doesn't ANYONE want a free '74 Bus? - rec.autos.vw #66815

I am very surprised: despite several posts, is there may be no one on this
list who wants a '74 Bus with Type II engine for free?  This bus is
sitting in my mother's backyard at 9 Birchwood Terrace, Groveland
Massachusetts, and  anyone who wants it can go take it before September
6th.  I asked people to e-mail me or call me (212/645-4136) before setting
off so I could give my mom some notice, but apparently no one has any
interest.  When the house is sold, it goes to the crushers, so I hope
someone decides to take it.

(earlier post below)

If you are still interested, I still have the VW bus available, but it
could not be moved while the yard area was a) buried under snow and b)
awash in spring mud.  The most recent problem is that the person who was
going to try to sell it for me, and to whom I sent the keys, lost them,
and there are no others.  Therefore, you would have to have a locksmith
make one or something similar.

Please let me know if you are still interested.  I MUST get rid of this
thing this summer.

&gt; I have am orange '74 VW bus that ayone can have who wants it.  Last run
6
&gt; years or so ago, but ran well then and has gas stabilizer in it.  Two
flat
&gt; tires (though unmounted replacements inside), and two new,
never-installed
&gt; heater boxes. Body rust but no structural rust under the floor pan that
I
&gt; can see.  When I last used it, its only real problem was that the
parking
&gt; brakes didn't work, and a previous owner had let the clutch cable get so
&gt; slack that the clutch wasn't freeing and it ruined the synchromesh in
the
&gt; transmission.  New clutch cable now, but you have to doubleclutch shift
by
&gt; feel, like a motorcycle -- it is not a problem, ince you're used to it. 
&gt; Only other problem is that it badly needs a tuneup, a new battery, and
has
&gt; a slight leak from one pushrod tube.  In addition, the keys were lost
some years
&gt;ago, so you'll have to call a locksmith or lift the front end to move it.
