Subject: Re: Vanagon Hub caps


Gregg,

I don't know about the 'baby moon' hub caps of the pre-70s but
I have installed the 70's style chrome cap on my '86. These are
the flat ones, but I think it looks a lot better than the plastic 
aero wheel covers that where on the van. I got the chrome caps from
West Coast Metric (800-247-3202), for about $7.50 each.

Anybody want a set of FREE plastic aero wheel covers for a Vanagon?
You pay the shipping, you can have them.
