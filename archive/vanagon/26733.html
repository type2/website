&gt;It was due to Ronald
&gt;Reagan's first term &quot;Trickle Down&quot; stupidness that caused all construction
&gt;and misc spending to come to a screaming stop between '80-'83. No one was
&gt;buying anything. DOH~!

As I recall, the 23% interest rates from Jim Boy's administration were
still around then, along with a Congress that kept declaring Reagan's
budgets &quot;D.O.A.&quot; and substituting their own.

I wouldn't have done any housing starts then either!
