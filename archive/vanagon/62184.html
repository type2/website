&gt; &gt; So why does my van die when out in the rain? can be driving along nice
&gt; &gt; weather, gets good gas miles, pass into the rainy area and the performance
&gt; &gt; just sucks, will have to pull over because of a loss of power, keep
&gt; &gt; revvvving the engine and it might come back to where it sounds like a
&gt; &gt; normal engine,  86 westy

&gt; Mine does the same thing.  (83.5).  I am guessing it is bad wiring
&gt; harness.  Either main or air-flow sensor.???

Mine too.  I suspect the 02 sensor is shorting out.  But then, I always
suspect the 02 sensor...
