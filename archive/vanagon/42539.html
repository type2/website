Dennis,

I'll definately take your advice on the thermostat.  Certainly makes sense.
 The engine temp seems to be fine in the evening and at night when the
outside temperature is cooler.  Hmmmm....I don't know.  Would the stretched
water pump belt contribute to the problem?  Any ideas about the heat coming
through the cab vents when they're closed?
