&gt; 1.BLIND WITH NO LIGHTS    Am planning on installing additional interior
&gt;  lighting, and would be interested to hear others' methods. PLan on going
to
&gt;  the local marine store and purchasing long 12v f lights or sliding door
&gt;  area. Hard to believe with all that Westfalia engineering, we can't even
&gt;  have a light when the side door opens at night! Ditto for rear hatch
(round
&gt;  light).

Some newer models of Vanagons came with a nice flourescent light mounted
above the left windows in the central passenger area.  It lights the whole
&quot;room&quot; up quite nicely.  I've found an aftermarket source for this
flourescent light.  Let me know if you'd like it. 

Above the front passenger door there is a cutout for a small light like that
found above the driver's door.  All you need to do is buy a light, cut
through the headliner, pop the little plastic cover out of the cutout, run
three wires and install.

I've also installed one of these little lights in the rear hatch.  It lights
the cargo area pretty well.  I cut a hole in the vinyl covered trim piece
about 4&quot; left of center (there is a large support brace in the center) and
mounted it.  Getting additional wiring into the door is a bit of work though.
  
&gt;  2. CONSOLE    Am planning on removing plastic shroud around dash under
&gt;  middle section behind stick shift and bolt a tray there for the ubiquitous
&gt;  coffee cup/console use. See any objections (besides clearance, etc.)?
  
Shroud?  What shroud?  Thats the heater's air distribution box isn't it?
