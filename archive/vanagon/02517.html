Hi all!
Some previous discussions on part sources made me think of passing one 
along.
I got a catalog recently from a place called The Bus Stop.  It is a division 
of Rocky Mountain Motorworks. Catalog lists parts applicable to Busses 
from'50-'79.
It is about 70 pages with some pretty good stuff.  Extensive listing on FI 
parts as well as lots of body and interior parts.(They even list full nose 
panels for 68-72 Buses).
They have toll-free numbers for catalog request(1-800-544-1066), customer 
service,
tech support, sales, and fax.  I haven't ordered anything from them yet but 
I am impressed by their service.  I saw the announcement for there catalog 
in one of the VW mags and called to request one.  They said they were having 
some problems
with the catalog production and it would be delayed by a couple of months. 
 They
took my name and address and said they would send me one when they were 
available.  It was about 5 months later but I did get my catalog.  Seems 
like a lot o0f effort to keep someone's name in the file just to send them a 
free catalog.  Makes me want to at least give them a try sometime.  Anyway, 
 you guys/gals on the net may want to call them for a catalog if you are 
looking for a mail order parts source.

And by the way I am in no way affiliated with etc. etc.
