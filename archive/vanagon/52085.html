&gt;       Any suggestions for snow traction devices for an '85 Westy.  How 
&gt;     about chains vs. cables.  Are there some brands/types that are easier 
&gt;     to put on than others?

&quot;Z&quot; cable chains are the ones I've settled on after going thru too many sets
like those described below - they are by far the smoothest, easiest to
install, and won't disintegrate if you have to make a quick run up to 35 mph
&amp; back.   (they're not worth much off road or in mud, however).  They're on
sale in the current JCW special  'sale' catalog.


&gt;       I have a set of cables for my other car that I dread to put on 
&gt;     because you have to reach behind the wheel and thread a nylon web 
&gt;     through a buckle to secure them.  This is not easy when your hands are 
&gt;     cold &amp; numb and you can't see what your doing because the wheel is 
&gt;     blocking your sight.

This *really* s*cks - the first set I had were these - absolute junk, you
can never tighten them enough even with a rubber spider, &amp; trying to thread
the stupid nylon strap while working in frozen slush at night will make you
regret saving a few $$.
