Hi,

	I'm still stumped on the starter problem.  I charged up the battery for
2 days at 1 amp, and the lights are nice and bright, but the starter still
only makes groaning noises when I try to crank her over.  I'm on the
verge of yanking the motor out and replacing the bushing, but that seems
like a lot of work to do that little thing.  (I know how to yank the motor,
I'm just lazy.  I can do it in under 10 minutes when properly motivated)

	Any last minute suggestions before I embark on this?  Am I barking up
the wrong tree?

	I know its not the switch 'cause I jumped the wires manually with a
screwdriver to the same effect.  It just makes a loud chatter/groan.  Its
brand spankin' new, too!

	Any help is always appreciated!

	In other news, I am going to order the sunroof cover tomorrow.  I'm
going to go with plain black vinyl for now.  Maybe someday in the future 
I'll move up to canvas, but I don't feel I need it yet.  Stay tuned for
the upcoming saga!
