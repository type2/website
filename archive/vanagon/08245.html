&gt;Has any one considered mounting those &quot;aircraft&quot; Halogen type  focussed
&gt;lenses on their Vanagons? If so where would you put them (it)? One big guy
&gt;right on the roof? or two smaller ones on the bumpers. Would they be
&gt;sufficient to stop deer in their tracks...just kidding....DC

i have four (4) 7&quot; lights on my front bumper (two fogs, one driving, and
one geez-it-looks-like-an-airplane &quot;pencil&quot; beam). since the 88 bus has those
el cheapo plastic bumpers, i felt like i had put some big washers on both
sides of the bumper surface (to keep the plastic from being cracked easily).

stop deer? no ... the heat makes them (deer) uncomfortable, and they run off.

rear fog light: yup. got one 5&quot; red fog light and one 5&quot; clear fog light.
the red fog helps an awful lot in bad fog (maybe not as bad as SF/Bay area,
but the coast of alabama in spring can get pretty bad) ... and it solves
one problem, David: it's rather bright, so folks do NOT get very close behind
you ... it tends to hurt their eyes. :)  just a thought.  and they CAN see it
from about 200 feet back, no matter how thick the fog. fer real. i first saw
one on a truck down in Mobile and was really impressed at how visible it was.
as i came up behind the truck (obviously going too fast for local conditions),
i could see this big ball of red up ahead. i had no idea WHAT it was, but i
knew SOMETHING was there. so i was sold.

one problem with all of this: it never gets bad enough up where i live now to
really use all these lights. :(  especially the driving/pencil. on the inter-
states, you don't really need them. they reach out to over a mile, and there
is almost always too much traffic to justify using them. but they look nice.:)
and every now and then, i get on some little two-lane.
