Subject: Fwd: LA Vanagon Westy's for rent?

There is an outfit that has been around for a number of years that rents
Vanagon Westfalias in Phoenix and Albuquerque.  They also buy '86 and newer
Westys.  They are called Roamin' Holiday, 800-969-8040.  They advertise in
the NEATO newsletter, Old Bus Review.  Also, email: roamin_at_rt66_dot_com.

My brother-in-law and his wife are planning a trip to the desert.  They
plan on flying into Los Angeles and are wondering if there are any places
that rent Westfalias or Eurovan campers the the L.A. area.  Can anybody
give me a heads up on this.

Thanks,

Fred
