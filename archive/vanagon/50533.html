I have to sell my '72 bus. Body is in really good shape, fairly
new tires. Motor making funny noises. Drives excellent, won't
charge a battery, Would like $400. I've   done all the wiring up,
transmission is good. Would consider trade for a decent tranny
for my '62 bug. 


Call:  206-941-5181
Or email ekoman_at_u.washington_dot_edu

I haven't used vi in years...since when did it become my default
editor????
