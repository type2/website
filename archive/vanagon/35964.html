&gt;This is where I start to go nuts, because while they're loose, they fall

&gt;The measurement problem looks to be in the crankpin diameter,  right?
&gt;Does anybody know what they *should* be? Until I can figure this out I
&gt;can't make them give me the right bearings because I don't know what to
&gt;ask for.

Drop test!  It can be affected oil viscosity and temparature. Sounds like you
need to have a machinist measure it for you.  Since crank is in your hand,  a
dial indicator can be used to measure the play.  On a type one motor, why
would you want a crank that is .020 &quot; undersized any way.  Alos, have the
rods been re-sized.  They can be worn out of round and cause excess
clearence.
