couldn't find a motor, I bought another '87. However, since the first
vanagon is basically in very good condition, it is loaded with good
parts. Some I will use. Some I would like to sell. If anyone needs
things like a computer, steering rack, interior pieces, etc. please
let me know at bbellm_at_neca_dot_com.&quot;&gt;
Bruce,
Sounds like really bad luck with your engine experience!
Do you happen to know if the 87 interior is the same as an 86?  I'm
looking for some 2nd and 3rd row grey cloth seats (GL style - with
armrests) with the headrest receptors along the tops of the seatbacks.
I'm not sure in what year this change was made, but a couple of people
have said 87.
Thanks,
