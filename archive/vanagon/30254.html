    &gt; I got mine from the Tire Rack (interest disclaimer) for significantly
     &gt;less than local quotes, they were about $86 each, if my memory
     &gt;is still working....

     &gt;Tom F.

I got mine from the &quot;Boys of Pep&quot;, came with a lifetime balance and rotate 
(!) thingie, as well as a road hazard guarantee....which I was glad to pay 
and additional $6 (or $8..._dot_can't remember) to protect my sneaks from all 
those terrible off-road hazards.

Tires were $69 each.  FWIW......   (yes, 27x8.75....)
