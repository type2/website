Subject: Re: Rebuild help please!

I had a similar engine death. I never found that piece of metal. I cleaned
it up, replaiced a head, a drove it off. The cam was wiped shortly
thereafter. Could that piece of metal done it? I dunno. I'd crack the case
and check it all out personally. I wish I had.

&gt; Well, I see the error of my ways.  A while back I posted to ask if anyone
&gt; could suggest a source for a rebuilt engine and got no replies.  So, I see
&gt; the light, and will attempt a rebuild myself...
&gt; 
&gt; I have pulled all of the sheet metal off and pulled the heads and cylinders.
&gt; It looks really bad!  There is a big chunk of head missing by the #1 exhaust
&gt; valve, and the forward cylinders both have seize marks.  Looks like I'm 
&gt; going to have to replace the heads, cylinders and pistons for big $$$.  And
&gt; of course the &amp;(_at_#$%^^#^ thermostat!!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, if anyone of you air-cooled gurus can suggest anything I should do
&gt; while I have the beast in pieces, please advise me.  This is the first time
&gt; I have ever done anything of this magnitude for my car.  What should I 
&gt; check for?  What should always be replaced?  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for your help,
