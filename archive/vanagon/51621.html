Subject: Hey California folks

Hi fellow CA residents---
     I've been corresponding with a few of the people who've posted cars FS
on the list, and I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with buying
and bringing back out of state cars, particularly VW's.  DMV sez it will need
an EPA sticker (?) or be subject to $300 penalty, plus 2% of its fair market
value, or somesuch.  Was there a CA version of Vanagons for lower emissions,
or were they all the same?  Any input would be greatly appreciated.

     Many thanks, Matt Q.
