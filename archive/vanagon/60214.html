Subject: Re: Carat dash clock source?

The clock in my '91 Westie was not correctly set, and pushing inside
those two little holes weren't changing anything, even after trying with
a mechanical pencil. So I took the dash cover out, and disconnected the
clock's wire for the amount of time it was off. (Luckily it was only
about an hour). The trick here is to reconnect exactly at the specific
time needed. It worked for me.
