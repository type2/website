Subject: mo' motor mounts

motor mounts.  another queasey sea of unknowns.  urrrp.

having a similar clutch shuddering problem and similar suspicions i talked to our VW 
service manager, the venerable 'JD'.  he wasn't eager to accept my money for new 
mounts.  he said the vanagons run with extremely soft motor mounts to absorb the 
engine vibrations, particularly at idle, as they tend to idle rough &lt;grin - right 
gerry?&gt; due to some valve timing overlap that a far eastern manufacturer wouldn't 
accept.  you'll see the exhaust system bouncing up and down at idle like a kid that 
has to pee.  that isn't why they break.  well it is but not the REAL reason.  the real 
reason is that we have exhaust systems made of about 20 feet of thinwall tubing 
including the header.  which everyone else sees to make of cast iron.

but the clutch.  i still think the springy motor mounts contribute to this problem, 
advice from the service manager respectfully pushed aside.  he said he just doesn't 
see that many bad motor mounts, even on vanagons with 300K miles on them.  i think my 
shift lever whops around too much on torque changes and still want to change the 
mounts.

anyone have prices?  comments?  testimonials or castigations?
