Subject: Storing a Syncro

The long and arduous mechanical battles with my Syncro are about halt for
the time being.  I had hoped to take my brick on a 4000 mile journey, but I
fear there is a strong chance it'll need work along the way, so I've opted
for the trusted Subaru instead.

The Syncro will be stored for work at a later date.

*** What prep should occur before storing it for more than 7 months.

A friend suggested that I place it on blocks so the tires don't develop
flat spots.  Is that true and should I do anything else other than purge
all of the fuel.

Man, I wish I could drive that brick!!
