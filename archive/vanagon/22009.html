Can anyone help me?  My parking sticker went down the window.  Is there any eas
y way to access the window wall?  What holds the interior panel to the exterior
 door?  I can see the two screws that hold on the armrest, but how do I get the
crank handle for the window off and does it just come off around the door handl
e?  Any help that anyone can give would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
