Subject: 82 vanagon heads

Please some one help!
I need to replace a head to my van ---valve seat sucked out 
It was made in spain and cost me $325, new and only lasted 40K miles.
I am using Pep Boys synthetic oil  ---supposed to be valvoline in disguise. 
I was haveing allot of valve clatter for 200 miles before total failure.  I think the #1 cyl  exhaust hyd lifter 
failed ---putting extra pressure on the valve seat somehow which caused premature head failure.   
Please --because I have to pull the motor for the for the 5th time,  anybody have some words of wisdom 
for me?
