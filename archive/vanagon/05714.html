&gt; &gt; 6) Brakes are mushy.  Is this typical?
&gt; 
&gt; They may require more force than a typical passenger car, and maybe a tad 
&gt; more springy, but definitely shouldn't be mushy.  
&gt; 

Agreed. My 81's brakes were mushy when I got it.  Replaced the master cylinder,
pumped all the old brake fluid out, tightened the rear brakes, checked the booster
unit, replaced the seal and now they work great.  Haven't had occasion to panic
stop yet, but they feel like they would lock up if needed.  If the brakes are mushy,
there's a problem.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 7) Steering has a bit of play and the &quot;sway factor&quot; seemed high.  Could
&gt; &gt; this be due to the passenger car tire it's shod with?
&gt; 
&gt; Subjective, but my '82 was actually a pretty tight handling rig.  Less 
&gt; sway, even at 90K than my '91 had new.  There is a spec for steering play 
&gt; - have the dealer measure it and verify that it confirms (and check it 
&gt; against the Bently manual yourself).  Definitely could be tires or even 
&gt; inflation pressure.  Have the dealer check out the steering and 
&gt; suspension, and certify that it's OK.  
&gt;

Check the &quot;links&quot; to the anti sway bar.  The sleeves the links run through rust
to the lower arm and the links themselves will rust to the sleeves.  If this 
happens, the links will snap where the threads ends and you'll get alot of
sway.  The only thing you can do then is to replace the link(s), the sleeves and
the bushings.  Then it tracks like a Rabbit 8).  Check the bushings the anti-
sway bar runs through for cracks, etc. and replace them if bad. 

The steering input to the rack and pinion runs through 3 &quot;steering knuckles&quot;.
These knuckles are actually 4 small metal sleeves that the bolts run through
wrapped with a heavy cord.  Then they hold the whole mess together with
molded rubber.  When the rubber starts to break down all that holds the 
knuckles together is this heavy cord, which will develop some give without
the rubber to hold it together.  Drop the spare tire carrier and inspect all
3 knuckles.  Chances are that one or more knuckles are in the process of
self-destructing and need to be replaced.  They run about $15 from the 
dealer.  Make sure that you mark the steering rods where they go into the
knuckle.  If you get them together wrong you'll have to reset the steering
wheel as well.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 8) What's a good price?
&gt; 
&gt; Haven't really followed prices but we traded our '82 (one of the 
&gt;

I paid $3300 for a 81 Westy with a new clutch and about $80k on
the clock in CO.  YMMV tho.
 
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.
