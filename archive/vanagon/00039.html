]In the process of removing the seats and carpet from my 84 Vanagon I
]discovered that the auxiliary heater beneath the rear bench seat has
]been slowly leaking antifreeze.  The two hoses appear to be in fine
]shape as well as the heater core itself.  The leak appears to be coming 
]from the little white threaded valve on the top left of the heater core
]housing.  I removed the valve and it's gasket and cleaned them up.  This
]has stopped the leak for now but I have yet to test it under pressure
]with the engine running.  Is this a common problem?

I dunno, but I suspect that my '84 has the same problem.  When I turn on
the rear heater I smell antifreeze.  I've been hesitant to lift the seat
and face the mess.

]Also, does the metal
]lever next to the valve alter the flow of coolant?  If so which position
]is open and which is closed?  If that is not it's function then what the 
]hell does it do?

I'd like to know the same thing, so don't reply to Jerry (unless you reply
to BOTH Jerrys).  Better you should reply to the list.
