&gt; Subject: List Stickers
&gt; I was cruising the archives to find some messages about a 'list'
&gt; sticker.  Is it still available?  Anyone know what I'm talking about?
&gt;
As the printer of the last batch of list stickers, let me step forward, with an
answer, as well as a tidbit for everyone else out there questing for an
exciting, newly designed, Official List Sticker and Bus Identifier.
Now that I've set the printing process in motion for the coffee mugs, my mind
has begun to wander back into sticker-land, especially as many folks have been
inquiring about them. I've had a new design in mind for a while, and have been
cleaning it up a bit. Anyway, the point is that in the next few weeks, if I
feel there is enough interest, I will print a batch of exciting, high-quality
List stickers with a thrilling NEW DESIGN! That's right, your old stickers,
while still nice to look at, will be passe! You'll have to buy new stickers to
be cool and current!
:)
 So, we shall see how things look, and if I'm not in too big of a hole after I
finish up the printing and distribution of the coffee mugs, I'll unleash the
exciting new design upon the list...
Anyway, thanks, and happy Bussing...
