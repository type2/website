Subject: Re: 91 injector seals recall

&gt; does anyone actually have the letter that came with/for/about that recall
&gt; on the injector seals? would they mind typing it in or mailing a copy to
&gt; me?  i'd like to add it to the Recall data file.
&gt;

I've got the letter, but it doesn't mention part numbers or such...
Only that it affects &quot;some 1990/91 model Volkswagen Vanagon and Synchro
vehicles&quot;.  Contact me by email if you'ld like me to mail you a copy,
though...
