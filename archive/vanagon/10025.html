Subject: deep cycle batteries

Ok, now a technical issue

The fridge I just installed is 12V, but hte rest of the bus is 6V.  I'm
thinking about using a deep cycle battery for the time being, and just run
the fridge off of it until some day I feel like converting to 12V.

How long should I expect to be able to run off of a deep cycle battery, with
a rated load of 5.5A?  (Looked like a 4A load on the charger)  Am I
even close to having a practical solution?  I would only be using the fridge
for a day at a time, like for beach trips.  Maybe longer in the future, but
I don't have any camping trips planned, except for maybe the next big bus
excusion.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thom
