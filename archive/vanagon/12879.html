Subject:       Archives reminder...

Don't forget there's an archive of all our messages!  Gerry (i think) 
has setup a nice search mechanism and it works.

for those of you new(er) to this list, you can often find previously 
discussed topics and get instaneous answers to 'old' questions.  ie. 
gas mileage. now, i don't mean to discourage you from bringing up topics 
again because often new people on the list provide new information 
and that is VERY valuable.  so feel free to ask away but know that 
there is also this great archive to access.

gopher to or set your WayBack Machine (any Sherman and Peabody fans 
out there?) aka Netscape/Mosaic/Lynx to:

gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:70/11/Miscellaneous/Vanagon

enjoy!
