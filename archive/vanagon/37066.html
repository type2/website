Subject: barndoor roof chop...

     All you buffers will be pleased to know that i've decided not to go 
     for the barndoor roof chop on my new single cab. I was only gonna do 
     the roof swap if the bus was a basket case, but now that i've gone for 
     a rust free one, i daren't do the roof swap.
     
     The barndoor roof section i had is now going to someone with a 
     barndoor bus to help save it - i'm swapping it for some semaphores and 
     a cash balance.
     
     yep, i'm still gonna put semaphores on my new single cab, as well as a 
     center brake light,
     
     Lee.
