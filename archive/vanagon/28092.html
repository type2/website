Hey VW people,

I was wondering if anyone out there has ever delt with the parts company 
known as MOFOCO. I am looking for a rebuild kit for my 1974 Westy and 
this is the only company I could find that sells a complete kit for an 
1800CC engine. The kit includes reconditioned crank, Main, Rod and Cam 
bearings, reconditiond rods, reground cam, reground lifters, flywheel 
seal, piston and barrell set, geasket set, and push rod tubes. The price 
on the kit is $409.95. This sound like alot for a little to me. If anyone 
has any info of other suggestions for me, the help would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Woody
