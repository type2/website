Subject: '72 oil cooler seals blown

Volks,

        I adjusted my valves last week and changed the oil/filter (replaced
with a FRAM - smaller outside diameter, but same seal).  Started OK next
morning (cold - 35 degrees F), but neede a jump that night from work.  While
idling, a co-worker mentioned  my oil leak  - and it was running out of the
oil cooler area.  Looked like water in oil, but careful examination the
&quot;whitish&quot; look was tiny bubbles.
        What the heck has happened? 
         Did I blow the oil cooler seals? (probably)  Isn't there some kind
of pressure relief valve that bypasses the cooler when pressures are high?
         Any ideas or suggestions are welcomed.  BTW, I have the engine out
of the van now...When I removed the top tin, I noticed that there is black
blow-by at the cylinder/head on the left side (actually, I haven't removed
the right side yet, so it could be the same).  This is a &quot;new&quot; rebuilt
engine I was told and all looks that way.  
        Is black blow-by an indication of bad heads? Bad head gaskets?  Does
it matter?
        Although the fan housing number matches the '72 year (CB), the block
number appears to be from a 2000cc (GD).  I guess I will have to remove a
head and measure bore and stroke to determine exactly what it is I do have
in this.
        Thanks in advance.
