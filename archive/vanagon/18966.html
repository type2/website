Subject: Boot camp foul-up



Dear Vanagon Subscribers,

I screwed up.  As Tim Maddox very kindly pointed out in a private post, the
number I posted is the generic catalog number covering just about everything
EXCEPT the late Transporters and Vanagons.  J. C. Whitney offers only the
boots for those vehicles (no kit).  The catalog number is 85 xx 6958-A,
$3.32. and is specific.  (For generic numbers, you give the girl the make,
model and year of your vehicle; the kit you receive may have a different
number than the one under which it was ordered.)

Sorry for the wasted bandwidth.

-Bob
