Subject: buying a new or used VW

I am planning to buy a Vanagon or Eurovan with Westfalia equipment
in the next couple of month (probably in August).

I used to drive a '87 Turbo Diesel Westfalia in Germany. (I am living 
in the Seattle are now.) How stupid of me to sell it ;-) Anyway, after
driving a sedan for 3 years now, I feel I have to go back to a van.

I don't really like the new Eurovan, but this is only a problem of
getting used to it. When the vanagon came out, I preferred the
previous &quot;round&quot; form too.

What would you recommend to me and why?

- buying a new Eurovan with Weekender equipment?
- buying a new Eurovan with some other camper equipment?
- buying an used Vanagon with Westfalia?

BTW, I am not a handy person and do not know much about fixing cars.
Almost all of the repairs would have to go to a professional.


Please let me know any thoughts you might have on this topic.

thanks,
--bjorn
