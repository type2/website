I intend to put in a fridge fan next summer. It will be my winter
project to see if I can rig one up. I can't see paying $25 for one

================================
Living here in the Silicon Valley, we have numerous electronic surplus stores
that stock a wide variety of 12 DC fans from a wide variety of electronic and
computer applications.  Prices are pretty cheap, $5?  If you have any such
sources in your area, it would be worth a look.  Another potential source
might be your local Radio Shack store.
