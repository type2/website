Subject: MOFOCO campout

       Hi everyone!

A reminder to anyone attending the MOFOCO show.  

Die Busbesitzer Gruppe is hosting its 3rd annual campout after the MOFOCO 
show this weekend after the showw at the dragstrip.  If interested, ask any 
of the split bus drivers at the show, or look for me.  I will have flye3rs 
availiable on the window of my very rusty 67 double cab.  I have really 
longt hair, and will be judging the car show.  OR, look for my brother's 
bus, a 67 two tone flat black over white.  Or mail me for directions to the farm


See you there!!
