Subject:  Re: Cops buses and profiles

I think I've had abnormal luck with this.  Never got pulled over in the 59,
cept once.  Didn't even notice the flashing lights for a while, just putting
along at 55, with a good tape in the player.  The cop had to pull up beside
me to get me to notice.  So I pulled over,  couldn't figure why.    Someone
had stole my registation sticker off my liscence plate.  Showed him my
registration, he was almost apologetic.  Drove it on Grateful Dead tour cross
country and back, up and down the coast, etc etc.   Just aqua blue with a
whale sticker on it,  but as a friend said, ANY old vw bus with california
plates is suspicious on the east coast.
  
For that reason,  someone i know tourd in a ford escort.   Had  NRA and
 American flag stickers on it.  Damn thing smoked all the time.  Never had
much luck ridi ng in American cars.  Break down all the time.  Gimme a bus
any day.  8)

     Another friend had a 63 bus with beautiful murals on it.  Lovely bus, if
you ignore the rot.   He was a horrible driver, though, and left a baggie of
mushrooms on the front seat.   Was pulled over and BUSTED!  Later same guy
mushed the front of the bus as he let his brakes get so bad it wouldn't stop.

     But, never was pulled over in a 61 another friend had, all painted with
murals of people dancin and doing handstands.  He never carried a drivers
liscence, either.  I think it has something to do with paranoia, getting
pulled.  That unseen, non rational but very real ability 6th sense that
people have to percieve, and to put off an un spoken message or feeling.
 They can tell when youre worried or vunerable.
so,
 travel in a bubble of white light, and keep your papers in order
   
and if you are pulled over, look confused, and say, well those SHOULD be the
right plates for this car.
