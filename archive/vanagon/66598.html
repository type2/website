Don't forget to order the chrome coil cover!!!!!

&gt;  The other best ways to dress the compartment are to replace the fuel
lines
&gt;  with stainless braided AN hoses, and paint the intake runners and
plenum.
&gt;
&gt;  Colorful spark-plug wires are easy, too. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; OH NO!!!!  the cheezy JC whipme custom look has spread from stoopid
beetles
&gt; to the Vanagons!!!!
&gt; watch out for those flourescent pink distributor caps!!!!  ;&lt;)
