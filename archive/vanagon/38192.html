Subject: a question or two..

Um, being not new to vws, but new to vanagons, I have a 
few questions in regards to me '85:

Burping the Radiator; I looked at the faq's, but 
still not clear how the debubbling process is 
accomplished.

Annoying Heater Cable Snap:
	One of my control cables has snapped right at the
space-shuttle-compexity a/c control, thereby creating 
colder conditions than my Beetle ..
It's the frontmost lefthand cable on control #2.

	There's wire about 2-3 inches out, and traced the
thing into the floor. How far does it go, and how
much resistance should the wire have in doing its job?
(that is, the other end may be stuck..)
is it a hideos prospect of changing the wire, or should 
I try to improvise a connector with what's left?

And the Obligatory:
Scary sounding klack:. Sometimes the noise
goes away utterly when it's warm..
I've eared everything, and narrowed it down to that 
metal assembly that regulates the air intake. sounds 
like something getting pulled to with every cycle and
rattling loose inside it. the noise seems to eminate 
from it.. Ideas? 

Charlie&quot;Just a few more adjustments&quot; C
