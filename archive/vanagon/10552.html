WARNING: Non VW related but very short. It is my hot-button though...


&gt; The solution to pollution is not &quot;dilution&quot;. The dilution mentality is best
&gt; exemplified by your local industries &quot;super tall&quot; somestack. If they build
&gt; the stack tall enough the &quot;flyash&quot; or whatever other particulates they are
&gt; producing disperse over a large enough area so that the company will be in
&gt; compliance w/ gov't reg's. It is not that they are polluting less, they are
&gt; just dispersing it over a larger area!

I have often stated that the solution to much stack pollution involves
&quot;one&quot; federal regulation: Limit stack-size to a very short height. This
will put the pollutants on the ground locally, and the states can figure
out what THEY want to do. A factory will be much more &quot;incented&quot; to fix 
a problem they have to breathe.  Let the acid rain (if it really exists)
fall in Chicago.

I apologize for the lack of VW content.
