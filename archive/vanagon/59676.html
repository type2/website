Hi Volks,
Just received a new toy from a friend returning from Germany.  It's a VW
Panel Van, two tone blue with a big VW logo on the side and on the top it
says &quot;Is the good vehicle-VW&quot;.  Friction driven, complete with sliding
door.  There's no indication of what year it is, has split windshield, no
side windows except driver's &amp; passenger's door, has a small rear window. 
The license plate in the front &amp; rer says  3  VWS 7.
Does anyone have one of these?
