&gt;Weren't there those things (no not Things!) which were based on
&gt;a Type 3 chassis and made for the German post office?

The Fredolin was based on a Karmann Ghia floorpan, had what appeared
to be a Typ3 front end, sliding doors on both the driver and passenger
side and had the typical upright Typ1 engine. According to the VW
museum the official name is the &quot;Kleinlieferwagen Typ 147&quot;, making
it a Typ1 vehicle.

As to the obligitory van connection of this vehicle...the body was
built by Westfalia.
