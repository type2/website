Subject: Re: Raising the roof

&gt; I've seen some buses around that have a high roof.  Not a pop-top, but an
&gt; entire raised roof (about a foot and a half or so).
&gt; 
&gt; Cheese
&gt; 
FWIW the local Bug guy just got in a '73 or '74 Safare Custom Camper.
I take this to be their top o the line model just like David's.  Camper
is Orange and White, Safare serial number was in the xxx700's I think.
It has the propane stove, propane/electric fridge behind passenger seat.
Cabinets and sink on the other wall.  Body is excellent structurally
I think she has CA plates (this guy really does haul em in from the
oddest places), needs cosmetics, paint, and rubber outside and the
inside is complete but pretty worn plus a certain lingering &quot;aroma&quot;
from previous want to be hippy owner who probably lived in it a while.
I think Bug man has rebuilt the engine and probably brake system, but as
a rule this guy is a total ass who always wants double what something is
worth but to tell the truth I don't know what he actually sells the
stuff for.  I figure she might be worth about $1000-$1500 if engine
is real solid so he's probably asking $3000+.  Anyway somebody dieing for one
in the NE in solid restorable shape should check it out.  His place is
the Bug Works in Morgantown WV, (304) 599-9801.
