&gt;When you want to make a 90 degree turn and do it fast in an aircooled VW,
&gt;you twitch the wheel hard left (or right) and accelerate.

Whereas if you want to do a 180, hang the right wheels off onto a gravel
shoulder and slam the brakes.

(Somebody's gonna get hurt. We're all going to be sued, I just know it. I
just now decided not to divulge any fun stunts you can do on a Yamaha 650
that I learned in college when I thought my body was made of Kevlar. I'm
too old for this and you should be, too.)
