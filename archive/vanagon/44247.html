I refrained from posting with my old &quot;tag-line&quot; back when we were told bandwidth
was at a premium. I realized how precious a commodity V_at_L is and decided NOT to post

my Eudora settings and seemingly didn't include my prefs in NetScape..

Forgive me father for I have sinned.... While I still do restorations (2 verts, 1-23 win,
1-21 win, and the 65 SingleCab at the present) The only one I can call my own is the
65 SingleCab (aka the infamous Lemonhead) The rest belong now to customers as do the
Binz, the 58 panel and the 58 15 window.
