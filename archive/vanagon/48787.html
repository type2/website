Well... from what you've said, it sounds like you're getting gas okay.

First, Check that your throttle valve is adjusted correctly.  Have someone
press the pedal and make sure it is opening.  

Next, check to see that your getting spark from the plugs and go backwards
from there.  Check the wires, distributor, rotor, cap, coil.

If you're getting spark, then check that you're getting enough air by
removing the air snorkel from the air distributor and see if it will
start.  If it starts, then you know you have a problem with air delivery,
so check all of those components out.

If it still doesn't start then I would check the oxygen sensor, coolant
temp sensor, idle stabilizer and all the electrical connections inbetween.

Another thing to check is the catalytic converter.  See if it is clogged.
This may not allow the system to breath properly.

Good Luck!
