Subject: Bolts Are OFF...Many THANKS to all...

hey now,

finally got that #$_at_#_at_%›› last bolt off yesterday. i was running outta liquid
wrench, didn't have any more knuckles to scrape, and was about ready to give
up.

me: &quot;you know, this damn bolt is causing me to be highly pissed off.&quot;

friend: &quot;he he...welcome to the world of auto mechanics..get used to it.&quot;

me: &quot;i'm going to try one last time...then i'm gonna sell this van..&quot;

friend: &quot;yeah right&quot;

*curse words...sounds of straining...bolt moves a little...i shout holy _at_#$%!*

friend: &quot;what'sa matter?&quot;

me: &quot;i got it loose....imagine that..&quot;

friend: &quot;just remember you haveta get it back on.&quot;

me: &quot;grrr&quot;

just want to say thanks to everyone for answering my questions. i'm new to vw's
and new to car mechanics in general. getting cv joints off has been the biggest
project i've ever done. next it's tie rods. but this group is great...thanks
a bunch guys.
