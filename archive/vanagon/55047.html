Tom,

The easiest way will be the Subaru conversion. All you
may need you get from local US dealer.

For Golf/Jetta conversion you will need the Diesel
bellhousing. It fits your tranny. Other parts like
oil pan and exhaust system and engine support needed
from a Vanagon Diesel, ask tcarrington for details:

Other conversion will be Ford engines up to the 2.8L
and AUDI 5 Cylinders, but this all need an extension
of the engine compartment. Parts available from a
German dealer or VW of South Africa.

Description of the AUDI conversion comes soon on WWW.
