Re: Best parking in the house...

Yup! While driving into the Classic's show car area, a worker came running
up to me and asked if I really was going to show my pathetically dirty
Westy. I said yes, it would be in the &quot;Off-road, thrashing in the Arizona
Desert searching for abandoned buses-Really used as a camper on the way to
the VW Classic&quot;   category. The kid just looked at me stupified and let me
slide. =)
