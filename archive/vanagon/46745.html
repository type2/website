&gt; Hello watercoolers,
&gt; 1) Because it was new to me, I had the van &quot;tuned&quot; up by my mechanic who does
&gt; most work on my 1986 Volvo DL.  It runs smoothly but I noticed that while
&gt; riding really slow in 1st or 2nd gear, around a campground lets say, the van was
&gt; really &quot;herky jerky&quot; or bouncy.  It was really sensitive when I gave it a 
&gt; little gas or let it off. I didn't really notice this before the &quot;tune up&quot;.  
&gt; Can anyone identify with this?  Is there a solution? 
Not sure about the 83-85 engines, but on mine this symptom was caused 
mainly by a sticking throttle position switch. It is a small switch 
under the throttle body which should close at idle and full throttle. 
Check the Bentley manual for the exact description on your '84. 

&gt; 2) My fridge.  Me and fridges don't get along.  I had it serviced 
by an RV
&gt; outfit.  They got it going on 110V and propane, and said everything was okay.
&gt; You bet, on Thursday I got it going on 110V and things were nice and cold in
&gt; the morning.  Before we left I got it going on propane.  Took a some doing
&gt; which was a little disconcerting.  I had been told not to run it on 12V while
&gt; riding because it still draws a lot of current.  &quot;Turn on the propane and
&gt; forget about it until you get home&quot; was the advise I got from more than one
&gt; person.  When I got set up at camp fridge wasn't on.  I wasn't out of propane
&gt; because I got the stove going.  I then went through the whole procedure of 
&gt; getting the fridge going again and sure enough it lit and stayed on all night. 
&gt; I discovered that the fridge would turn off when I was *driving* because when we
&gt; got to the trail head of our hike it was off again!  Obviously the pilot light 
&gt; was being snuffed out.  Again, can anyone identify with this?  Is
&gt; there a solution?
Yes, don't run the propane on. My Dad does this with his truck &amp; 
camper, but I prefer not to risk a gas leak. I've run for 2 weeks 
straight using gas at night, and 12v while driving with *no* 
problems. (just make sure the van is level when you light the gas). 
If the 12v isn't working check the fuse behind driver's seat on the 
floor. I found that if the fridge was already cold, 12v could 
maintain the frost on the fins while driving, even when 80-90 outside.
