&gt;&gt; If the law is bad work to change it.
&gt;
&gt;I know you will think this is a bad attitude, but I'd have a better
&gt;chance of walking on the moon than getting this law changed.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; You may not disregard a law merely because it
&gt;&gt; inconvieniences you and you believe it does no good.
&gt;
&gt;I do it every day.  Have you ever driven 56mph on a freeway?
&gt;Everyone does what they feel is right, for whatever reason.  We would be
&gt;better off concentrating on our own morality than blindly following
&gt;every rule on the books.


Would you believe that there is legal precedent for disregarding laws,
even without a &quot;good&quot; reason?

In 1988, a law was enacted prohibiting shipping companies from brining
ashore certain kinds of fruit without a government inspection. Shortly
after signing it into law, the gummint minions discovered that there
were about a dozen qualified inspectors who could be spared for this duty,
to inspect umpteen million tons of fruit that came in every week-- clearly
an impossible task.

To repeal the law would be as difficult as enacting it-- they had to pass
another law in the same way, repealing the first one. Asking a judge for
a restraining order to stay their own law, would have left egg on a lot
of faces, however deserving. And there was no money to hire/train more
inspectors.

Their solution? &quot;Well, we just won't enforce the law&quot;.

If you thik silly laws weaken respect for all laws... try THAT line on for
size! People who wanted to obey all laws, couldn't land fruit, or would risk
spoilage while waiting for inspection. Those who disregarded the law, got
off-- with the tacit blessing of the gummint.

The moral of the story is, it is not the gummint's only duty, to pass
laws for whatever reasons. It is also the duty of gummint to ensure it
does not make its citizens' lives arbitrarily harder (even a little
bit, if you want to shoot for perfection) in exchange for marginal good.

I know, lots of value judgements to be made here. But this is what is
sadly lacking in such things as 55-mph laws. Does this mean we can disregard
the 55 laws? IMHO yes. Again, I know, lots of arguments can be (and have
been) made against this-- some by moi. But OTOH, I speed all the time. So 
that
really points out how I feel-- I submit that the rest is empty rhetoric. And
to the rest who say one thing while doing another, the same applies.

The vast majority of drivers on So Cal freeways, drive over 55. IMHO they
are voting with their gas pedals when they (we) do this. The 55 law should
be overturned, purely on this basis. Again, talk to the contrary is empty
rhetoric-- either blatant hypocrisy (except by the very few 55ers), or
unwarranted meddling by people who never drive and who have no business
telling drivers how to live their lives.

Majority rules, ladies and gents. The lawmakers are out of touch, and should
get their acts together.

Well, enough heavy stuff-- guess I shoulda waited till Friday.
