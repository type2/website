Subject: 87 vanagon oil pressure problems


Had engine rebuilt by reputable engine rebuilder - not a VW garage - 
because a main bearing was failing after only 90,000 miles.

Have the following problem with the rebuilt engine - only about 200 miles 
- garage that did the R&amp;R is trying to solve problem.

Hot day - about 90 degrees.  Two mile upgrade.  Can just maintain about 55
in 4th gear.  Get over the top of the hill and slow down because there is
an intersection.  As slow down - oil pressure light/buzzer goes off.  Rev
engine to 3000 rpm - light goes off.  Does this a few times for less than
30 seconds - then problem disappears. 

Hot day - about 90 degrees - one mile upgrade - goe up at 3500 rpm in 3rd
gear.  Get to top of hill - shift into 4th.  No problem for about 30 or
seconds as stay at 55 mph.  Stop.  Make left turn - accelerate in first,
shift into second - as rpms drop -oil light/buzzer go off - rev engine,
light goes off. 

In garage - have checked the two oil pressure switches - both are OK.   
Have put mechanical pressure guage on engine - lots of pressure at 2000 
rpm - much better than VW specs.

ANY IDEAS????   I'm wondering about the oil pressure relief valve.  Does 
spring need replacing?   Did valve bore or cylinder get scored in rebuild 
or are metal chips (gasp) causing valve to stick?

Anyone else had a problem like this - what was your solution.


This is my third bus - an 87 Vanagon Syncro.  Others were a 68 and a 
74.
