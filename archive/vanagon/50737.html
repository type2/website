Subject:       90 Vanagon with intermittent (brake?) hiccups -- HELP

I have a 90 vanagon, which is having a funny problem.  Once in a 
while, while I am stopped for a while (such as at a traffic light), 
the van jerks just slightly -- as if I had taken my foot off the 
brake and then re-applied it, but faster than what I could do myself. 
 It also, occasionally, feels temporarily 'stuck' when I start up 
again from a light.  I'll be sitting at a red light, foot on the 
brake, and when the light turns green, apply the accelerator, and 
then it takes just a few seconds before the car moves at all -- as if 
it were sitting on something sticky and had to break free.  Neither 
of these things happens with any consistency -- it's once or twice, 
every few days.  I'm concerned of course, that it might be the start 
of something serious, especially since I have a hunch it may involve 
the brakes.  Can anyone give me any insights?

Thanks in advance.
