Subject: RE: Rabbit/Jetta engine swap

Martin Schneider Designed Systems (MSDS) in their writeup on putting Porsche
engines in Vanagons does not discriminate between 2WD and Synchro; I would
take it that the bellhousings are identical.  In the Porsche-into-Synchro
conversion you do have to reroute the fuel filler because it goes through
where the Porsche's oil tank needs to be.  120+ hp Synchro sounds neat to me.
