Hitchhiker's Lament
(sing it to the tune of Streets of Laredo or Cowboy's Lament)


As I was out driving one morning for pleasure,
My bus and me riding one morning so fair,
I spied an old geezer beside of the highway,
A pack on his back and his thumb in the air.

There was something about him that gathered my notice,
A something familiar, and yet still unseen,
A spirit so kindred, I felt in a moment
That here but for god's grace was easily me.

I pulled to the shoulder and waved to him friendly,
He walked to the bus and he slowly got in.
I asked, &quot;Where you headed?&quot;. He answered, &quot;Out that way.&quot;
&quot;And I'm later than usual,&quot; he said with a grin.

In talking while riding, he told a sad story
Of trading two morrows for one yesterday,
And then he admitted that he once had buses,
And like his tomorrows, they faded away.

&quot;I once had a camper, a nice sixty-seven,
A neat little Microbus rolling along,
But the wife and I split up, I needed some money,
So I sold it to strangers, for nearly a song.&quot;

&quot;My fortunes rebounded, a year or so later,
But by then the buses had lost most their charm,
Still I bought me a Breadloaf, and learned that I loved it,
For it still was a Bus and could do me no harm.&quot;

&quot;After that there were others, in lengthy succession,
A Vanagon camper I had for a while,
A pickup, a kombi, a double-door panel,
I had always thought I'd be riding in style.&quot;

&quot;But fortunes and favors don't stay long at my house,
They find better lodging with others some day.
When I lost all my money, my job, and my buses,
That's when I packed up to try traveling this way.&quot;

&quot;As the years added to me, I wandered the country,
Searching and seeking and moving along,
Unsure of the way that my destiny pulled me,
I changed my direction like changing my song.&quot;

He talked for a long time to tell his life's story,
I listened intently to his sad refrain,
For his tale was spell-binding, no matter the sadness,
And he spoke as if knowing he'd rebound again.

My exit came up as we rode down the highway,
So I pulled to the shoulder and bid him farewell,
He thanked me profusely and wouldn't take money
And waved at me til I had turned down the dell.

And as I was driving, my home road returning,
His last words were ringing around in my brain,
&quot;Enjoy this nice bus for as long as you have it,
You just never know if you'll have one again.&quot;
