Names for buses!  Yep, I'm going to need a new name for my new bus!

My 1972 Westy (off-road) is named Prospector because the previous
owner was a real prospector and used this bus for prospecting trips.
(This one is still for sale...)

My 1973 Westy is named Georg (gay-org) because the previous owner
had already named him George and/or Georgie and I just made it more
Germanic (and I like the movie &quot;Sound of Music&quot;).

My new 1966 microbus camper (with the blown engine) we are just calling
&quot;Red&quot; because it is red on the bottom (sort of) and white/cream/grey on
top.  After seeing the movie 'Wyatt Earp' the other day I suggested
to Janice that we name it &quot;Festus&quot; (I guess I had Wyatt Earp confused
with Matt Dillon) or &quot;Doc Holiday&quot; but she didn't like those names...

This bus might do with a feminine name, she seems a little different 
from the others.  So?  Suggestions?  German girl's names?

 -Dyer

P.S.  I hope to have Red ready for the *Tremendous Transporter Trek*
      next spring/summer/fall :-)
