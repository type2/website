Subject: Re: List explosion!

Gerry, 

My wife is business editor at Newday/New York Newsday here in NY. She is
preparing a package of articles on the internet and is pestering me to come
up with the name of someone who toils in the background running a listserve.
They want to interview the person, ask what it is like, and feature the
person in a pacakge of articles on the interent. 

Newsday is well in to the top 10 papers in the country in terms of size. If
you don't think the publicity would get you in trouble perhaps I could have
a reporter call you. 

What your reaction? Want a be profiled as to what ever it is that you do to
enable us to do this? 

Derek

&gt;This is a good (tm) thing, not a bad thing.
&gt;Thanks to alert reader, Joel Walker, of Tookalooka, AL, for bringing the 
&gt;expansion of the list membership to my attention. As of today, the 
&gt;list membership broke 300.  There are actually 302, but only 298 of them 
&gt;are active (the other 4 are &quot;postponed&quot;)
&gt;
&gt;Donuts are in order.  Donut gift certificates can be mailed to:

&gt;
&gt;Thanks to everyone for making this a successful list!
