I've stripped off the exhaust and alternator from the waterboxer in my 
shed.  If anyone wants whats left, it's there for the taking, otherwise 
it goes to the junkyard.  Ran fine before removal, slight coolant leak 
which was never investigated (I had a replacement ready to go). I'm in 
the process of removing the heads to check for pitting.  Has top 
injection unit as well (no airbox).  It was a used replacement engine 
of unknown origin when I bought my Westy, if anyone can tell me how to 
find the S/N I'll see if it's a 2.1 or 1.9.  I have a Bentley, but 
still can't get the reference right with the illustration they have.  
Would possibly make a good rebuild project or boat anchor.  E-mail me 
for questions/details.

Scott
