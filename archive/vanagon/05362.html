&gt; 	Jack's point about connecting negative cables last is valid and
&gt; worth consideration. I've never seen or heard of a hydrogen exposion
&gt; associated with a jump-start, but it is a possibility. In which case
&gt; 
Hydrogen explosions can indeed happen, and are more of a risk when the 
battery is in the vehicle compartment.  Several years ago a friend jump 
started an old Volvo for a friend.  He narrowly escaped serious injury 
and both vehicles burned to the ground in his driveway.  Nearly lost the 
house too.  Fire trucks (called by alert neighbor) arrived just as the 
fire reached the roof.  He was treated for burns on face and arms.  May 
not happen often, but when it does it's intense.
