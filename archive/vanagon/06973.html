Subject: RE: need  advice about a  bus...

I'd say have the shop in Washington do the work.  I'm so used to my own garage
that I have trouble remembering what all needs to go to my Mom's house so I can
change her Honda's oil.  Plus, I find nothing takes the fun out of working on a
car liking having a deadline.  Just schedule a phone conversation so they can
tell you what all they plan before they start work.
