Subject: Re: List T-Shirts


        My T-shirt got here on saturday.  My wife took it already and now I
still don't have a list T-shirt, my wife has one(hey...how'd that
happen...that was mine!).

        At this point I'd like word on a sticker and I'm in for the coffee
mug (ceramic, wide base prefered).
