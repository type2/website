Subject:       Click-type vs beam torque wrenches

Here's something to consider in you tool searches:

Some specs ie vanagon head bolts, require that a specific torque be 
*held* until the bolt stops all movement.  This assures a very 
accurate torque in high compressability situation, ie thick gaskets 
or a lot of material to squish.  A beam torque wrench is the only 
suitable tool for holding a torque, as the click type releases 
somewhat at the 'click' and you cannot monitor continual torque as on 
the beam gauge.

The click type is nice to use in narrow confines and where you cannot 
see the beam gauge.  Also, they feel cool when they click :)

Forgive me if this was discussed previously.  I might have missed a 
post or two.
