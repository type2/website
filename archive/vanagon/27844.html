Subject:       Re: Splash Pans for a '56 &amp; booty.

&gt; The splash pan is one of the first things removed from the typical bus, but
&gt; it has a function and should be retained.  If your bus is lacking a splash
&gt; pan you can make a good replacement simply by pulling a fiberglas copy from
&gt; an existing pan.  The existing pan must be sanded, sealed and waxed to
&gt; prevent bonding, and your pull should have at least three layers of fabric on
&gt; the body, six on the flange.  The nice part is that your fiberglas copy won't
&gt; rust or rattle.

A Volkswagen rust or rattle!  I'll hear no such nonsense! &lt;grin&gt;

I imagine its the case with most old busses, but I took it off to 
work on the master cylinder, and never got it back on.  The cold air 
is now recommending that I do!
