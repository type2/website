Subject: Jersey Turnpike

On a recent band trip between Baltimore and Manhattan I spied two
bread-loaf bodies heading the other way (southbound) on the New Jersey
Turnpike.  The lead one was normal enough, but the trailing bus had a black
thing on the front.  As it went by, I realized that it was a radiator and
this was a Mexican bus!  So far from home...
Couldn't see the license plate to tell if it was just visiting or had
somehow snuck in and stayed.
