Subject: Radiator Cover on Vangon
Date: Fri, 8 Dec 1995 10:00:15 -0700 (MST)

Greetings,

As most of you already know, it is *REALLY* Cold up here in &quot;The Great 
White North&quot;.  I have installed a front cover to keep the blustery 
cold of of the radiator.  It helps quite a bit.  Has anyone installed 
covers over the BACK intakes to stop the cold air from going inside?
Would it be a big problem to do this?  I would like the van to heat up 
a little quicker.  What vanagon owner doesn't, right!!!  ;-)

Second question, when I look at the heat guage on the dashboard, where 
is it getting the reading from?  In other words, where is the sensor.  
I can drive the van and it registers heat.  I can stop the van and 15 
minutes later, (after not running), I can start it again, and it is 
registering COLD.  I realize it is cold here but I would imagine that 
it would be able to retain SOME heat.

Thanks for your help

Cheers
Tony
