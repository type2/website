Subject: Re: 84 Electrical-Fusible Link?

&gt;I have Bentley.  I track the &quot;ignition&quot; portion of the wiring
&gt;diagram.  I see connections to fuses in the fuse panel, but no
&gt;fusible link.  I trust my mechanic, but don't know where else to
&gt;look.  Call me con-fusible.

hmmm,  VW just use fuses, those flat ones in vanagons.  Let me know where 
this missing link is when you find it, just in case...  tim, equally confused.
