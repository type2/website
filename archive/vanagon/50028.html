Subject: Pelican Inn outing 10/12


Reminder - Evening gathering for the CCC's at Pelican Inn, Saturday, 
October 12, starting at 6 p.m.  I'll be posting directions to this
as the time draws closer, but to orient you, it's near Muir Beach.  

If you have darts, bring them - this is very much a British Pub atmosphere.

I'll try to get info on pricing for food, for those of you wishing to
eat dinner in addition to floating around in the bar.  

This place is pretty much out in the middle of nowhere.  Don't count on
there being any stores or gas nearby.

See you there on the 12th!

 Current lust list: DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a Eurovan TDI transporter,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.
