&gt;Barndoor panels have the upper vents, which are for venting the cargo area

Ah. How do they open? Just curious. Are they cabled to the cab?

Okay. I bet you open a little carboard flap and tie it back with a piece of
string, right? ;)

&gt;The first ones ('49/early '50) had vertical vents instead of
&gt;horizontal.

Somewhere in my memory is a datum: There were only two with the vertical
vents, they were prototypes, whereabouts unknown, missing presumed dead. Is
that right? I probably read that somewhere.
