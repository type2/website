&gt; Since most of the figures for mileage were for vangons, and mostly
&gt; water-cooled at that, I was wondering if someone can tell me if
&gt; the 10-12 mpg I am getting on a recently (1000 mi.) overhauled
&gt; engine is as pathetic as I think or if it's par for the course.

It is very common to for the valves to get out of adjustment very quickly
after a rebuild.  This could be the cause of your crappy milage.  I suggest
you take a look at the valves and make sure they are properly adjusted.

Unbalanced carbs and incorrect timing could also screw up the mpg department.
