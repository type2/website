Subject: Re: Weekly Statistics

&gt;To All:
&gt;
&gt;Whereas, all Type II owners are known to be brave, loyal, trusting and true,
&gt;as well as intelligent, kindly and thoughtful, it seems a mite odd that the
&gt;list remains so small.  And while we are but a small and happy band, there is
&gt;strength in numbers.
&gt;
&gt;I suggest that when any of us attend any gathering of Volkswagen owners that
&gt;we carry with us and display in some prominent place, a placard or sign
&gt;telling of the existance of the Vanagon list with easy instructions on how to
&gt;join, how to buy a computer, how to rebuild the 3/4 clutch hub of a late
&gt;model tranny, and other useful tidbits other Type II owners have been lusting
&gt;for.

Maybe we could get on the nightly news Internet report or something...there
was that thread on magnesium a while back.  Of course, that wouldn't really
draw in VW van fans as much as it would readers of alt.explosives.nuts

Seriously, I'd think we could get mention via letters to the editors of the
VW rags...anyone care to write? If not, pass on the addresses and I'll
write.

Of course, more numbers may mean more work for our benevolent list owner,
to whom I must defer. But if Gerald's up for more numbers, I'd be happy to
write the letters to the rags.

Thanks! Joe
