&gt;Subject:Re: Overheating, '87 Vanagon
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I request some help with what has turned out to be a chronic problem of
&gt;&gt;overheating on my '87 vanagon.  When driving at sustained speeds on the
&gt;&gt;highway, everything is fine for a while.  Then the red warning light on the
&gt;&gt;temp guage starts to flash and the temperature starts to rise.  I pull over
&gt;&gt;and check the engine.  the coolant seems to be boiling and overflowing into
&gt;&gt;the &quot;overflow&quot; tank.  It fills well over the cap and starts to come out.  I
&gt;&gt;release some of the pressure and the engine cools down if I drive at lower
&gt;&gt;rpm, say 3000.  The temp rises again when going up hills or if I let the
&gt;&gt;rpms creep up.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In town, the red warning light often flashes, but there plenty of coolant
&gt;&gt;and the engine temp doesn't seem to rise above half way on the guage.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have been to the mechanic several times.  There are no apparent leaks, no
&gt;&gt;apparent combustion of coolant (actually it doesn't seem to lose coolant).
&gt;&gt;He has changed the thermostat, the thermostat housing and says everything is
&gt;&gt;ok, but it isn't.  It works for a few days than it acts up again.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Any ideas?  I have had problems with heads and head gaskets, could this be
&gt;&gt;related?  Is exhaust gas getting into the coolant?  What tests are
&gt;&gt;available?  Help.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;Tom,
&gt;
&gt;Has the cooling system been bled of air?  Is your coolant fresh or is it a
&gt;couple of years old?  When was the last time the cooling system was
&gt;flushed?  BTW if I'm not mistaken the red warning light signals a low
&gt;level of coolant in the expansion tank and not an overheating situation.
&gt;In your case the cooling systen is overheating because your temp gauge is
&gt;going up and you have boil over so it sounds like you need to rule out if
&gt;you have enough coolant in system, properly bled of air, and coolant is
&gt;fresh.
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck
