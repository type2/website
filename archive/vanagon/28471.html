Hal,

Thanks for the feed back.

&gt; I'd like to follow up on some of the items discussed by Robert Tomaselli in
&gt; his very detailed response to Dan Herbert about the EV Camper.
&gt;
&gt; 2. The extended length EV Camper (Riatta?) is not the only camper available

I don't think the (Riatta?) and EV Camper are the same.

&gt; in Canada. There is also a regular length &quot;Eurovan CV Camper&quot; which seems to
&gt; come with many of the same features that Robert details. It &quot;starts at&quot;
$34,995
&gt; Canadian, a fair piece of change cheaper. I found out about it through a
home-
&gt; page set up by Southgate VW in Edmonton (403-435-4821). Incidently, they also
&gt; list a 7-seater GLS model (=93 EV MV??), a 4-seater CV model with a 2.5 litre
&gt; diesel engine, and a Transporter Panel Van (starting at $20,995).
&gt;
&gt; 3. Robert, your salesman may have lied to you about the crash test results,
but

As would be most salesman's nature.


&gt; The crash tests Robert's salesman was probably referring to were the ones
&gt; done by VW themselves and they're not published.

You are correct. Now that I jog my memory he did mention that the crash
tests were done in Europe, probably by VW.

&gt;
&gt; 5. I understand that EV Synchros ARE being produced but are not being
imported
&gt; to the US at this time. Rumor has it (again) that some Canadian dealers may
&gt; have them.

Excuse me while I wipe the drool away.

&gt;
&gt; 6. Extended warranties are not a bad idea with the EV, if you can get one for
&gt; dealer cost. The VW plans are expensive, but I got a cheaper one through
&gt; GE Capitol (yes, that's General Electric getting into the money biz) for
&gt; $435 in May of '93 that extended the 2 year bumper-to-bumper warranty to
&gt; 6 years or 75,000 miles. I filed two claims on it so far and they have been
&gt; settled quickly to my satisfaction. The only problem is that the dealer who
&gt; now works on the van doesn't know from this warranty and I have to do the
&gt; paperwork myself. Didn't have to with the dealer I bought it from.

My VW salesman actually told me to hold out on the VW plan and within the year
another company, probably GE, would be offering me a cheaper extended warranty.
It seemed strange but I went with it.

Another thing that puzzles me is that I saw some adds on TV a while back
stating the 100,000/5yr standard warranty on new 95 VW's. Anyone manage to get
a 95 EV with the 100,000/5yr warranty? I didn't, just got the standard 24K/2yr.


&gt; Lunch break's over.
