&gt; I would look at the bushings for the upper control arms first.   Bentley
&gt; tells how to see if they are worn, but the easy way is to unbolt the upper
&gt; ball joint and see if anything is loose.   I'd bet that either the control
&gt; arm bushings or the upper ball joint (s) are bad.  Neither are hard to
&gt; replace (assuming you replace the whole upper control arm.)   Someone on
&gt; the list (Ron Salmon at Bus Depot, or maybe Kyle Wade) had upper control
&gt; arms for sale at a very good price not too long ago, and I replaced them on
&gt; my 87, along with upper ball joints, and the clunking is miraculously gone.
&gt;
&gt; For the record, Unca Joel said it was probably the bushings.  I said Nah,
&gt; it sounds like ball joints,  I know what worn ball joints sound like.  But
&gt; he was at least 80% right, cause the bushings had noticeable play.   Maybe
&gt; the ball joints were worn too (a little loose anyway).   I replaced them
&gt; anyway.   Made me feel better.  Check the bushings first.

&gt; &gt;Any thoughts? Ball Joints? How do I check?

Frank,
With the mileage that your vehicle has on it, it would be correct to
suspect any of the following as noted in the memo from Dave:  Upper and
lower ball joints, upper control arm bushings, and/or lower control arm
bushings.  I have replaced all noted components on my '87 camper with
similar mileage.  Do not neglect to check the upper shock mount with
specific attention to the shock shaft where it passes through the upper
frame opening.  As the shock bushings age, they tend to shrink which
allows the shock shaft to migrate over and contact the frame.  This can
result in the noise you report and it is much cheaper to reapair than
rebuilding the front end.

Justin
