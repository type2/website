&gt; 
&gt; My 74 camper with a 1800 has stock dual carbs (solex 34-32 PDSIT 2,3.  I 
&gt; bought the van used and the carbs have never been set since I had it.
&gt; Both the Idiot guide and the Haynes manual give methods that require 
&gt; the use of a sync-meter of some 

&gt;  Any tips on setting up the carbs would be appreciated.  
&gt; The van appears to be runnin rich the tail pipe is lined with a nice tell 
&gt; tale lining of black soot.

Let me tell you what I did when I &quot;tried&quot; to synchronize my carbs which was
before I had access to the news net. much less this mailing list.

I read thoroughly the &quot;Idiot Guide&quot; on how to adjust the carbs for my '74 bus
under the carb section for dual carbs.  I fu-ked with it and fu-ked with it
using a synchronizer (Uni-Syn) I had bought from the local German Parts store 
which was a Victory Auto Parts Store if I remember correcltly.  It may have
been Von Housen but I'm not sure.  Anyway, I tried adjusting every screw in
both carbs as indicated in the procedure and still had no luck.  Finally after
weeks of putting off going to a garage I took it to a mechanic with a flashy
name called &quot;Performance Auto&quot; or some shit like that.  Well they dicked with
my car and finally got it dialed in to what they thought was right.  So I picked
it up and it seemed to drive okay so I paid them some outrageous some making a
definite mental note to never set foot in that place again.  So it drove fine
for a while but I noticed I was getting gasoline in the sump and also noticed
that one of the elbow boots for one of the tubes between the carbs was half off.

So I wrestled with it some more on my own with the typical constant encouragement
from my wife which equates to: &quot;Honey, why don't you just take it in and have
a professional fix it?&quot;  Of course, I take this kind of encouragement so well
that I only have to sleep two nights on the couch after the resulting argument.

So I read the &quot;Idiot Guide&quot; some more in hopes of finding some elusive bit of 
information that sometimes escapes my eye.  I check the Bentley too to make sure
they don't have any secretly hidden information or arrows pointing out in their
pictures of what other screws should be turned.  

After more fiddling with the syncronizer and many four-letter adjectives, I threw
in the towel and took it to the dealer in Sacramento and they do their magic for
about $90.00 and it comes out running like a champ.

So, after a good dose of crow, and alot of sweat and good-natured swearing, I
think it was worth the 90 bucks to have VW adjust it right the first time and 
hopefully, according to the manual, it should be easier to adjust after that.

I've since sold the '74 and have heard that it runs just fine with no problems
after the top-end rebuild I had done.  

At least I got something right! ;)

Moral: When you can't get it right yourself despite all the head-scratching and
       swearing and consulting,  swallow yer pride and take the damn thing in
       and get it fixed.
