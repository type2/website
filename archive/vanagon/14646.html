&gt; One more thing, there should never be any load on the input shaft of the
&gt; transmission (only torque applied to it).  
&gt; 
&gt; -David
&gt; 
&gt; If there is a load on the input shaft other than torque it means that the 
 engine to transmission mounting is loose and that should be dealt with 
 right away.

 My brother had a Corvair which had a clutch-out noise / clutch-in quiet 
 syndrome. It turned out to be loose rivets on the flywheel or pressure plate.
 Pushing in the clutch put an axial load on those items and stopped their
 movement. Don't know if there is a corollary arrangement on the VW though.

 For what it's worth,

 Dave
