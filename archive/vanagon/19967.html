Subject: of interest?


This in not exactly van related, but definitely VW related, so thought
I'd post it in case anyone is interested.  I have a friend who works
at a salvage car place in Oakland, CA, and a customer there wants
to sell what is apparently a in very good condition bug 'vert.  He
thinks the year is '71, color black, apparently no rust.  I haven't
seen the car, and don't know the party, but thought I'd pass this
on to the list members, since the price is going to be probably
around $1500, which seems quite reasonable, considering the car
is supposed to be in very nice condition, and the original, California
(I think) owner.  Anyway, if you want to pursue it , phone
Richard at 510.223.4786 evenings after 7.

  '81 westy (puke eggnog-ivory)  
  '79 bug 'vert (triple white)
  '74 Thing/Safare/Trekker/Acalpulco/181 wannabe.  If you hear of one in
       in need of a good home/restoration, etc., please let me know.  If
        you can't find me that, I'd take a good DC blender or coffee grinder.
