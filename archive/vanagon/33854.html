This from Gregg Carlen to another subscriber:

&gt;In a message dated 96-01-24 06:57:21 EST, you write:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;My van  intermitantly sends oil warnings (ie. warning light and nasty
&gt;&gt;buzzer at 2000+ RPM).
&gt;
&gt;Not really enough info to make an accurate diagnosis.  First, I would
&gt;recommend installing an analog oil pressure guage.  Electric are OK but I
&gt;would prefer a tube type that will read the actual pressure.  (Less chance
of
&gt;guage failure).
&gt;
&gt;Possibilities are:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;-Too little oil pressure.  Worn crank bearings, cam bearings, or oil pump
&gt;face plate.  Oil level low, broken down oil, etc...
&gt;
&gt;-Faulty guage.
&gt;
&gt;How many miles on your engine?  What is the compression of you cylinders?
 Is
&gt;there any noticeable sign of power loss?  What other symptons occur when the
&gt;light and buzzer go on?  Do you get power loss, lifter tapping, etc...?
&gt;
I, too am aware now, after reconnecting all the mangled wiring in the
engine compartment of my recently acquired '67, of a low idle low-pressure
condition in my '71 dual port. After buying the assurances of the PO that
compression is good (this backed up by a prof. diagnostic) and that the oil
was changed religiously and had no leaks (yeah sure) (it *was* topped off
and clean). I bought the bus even though the PPO's oil P and T gauges had
no senders and the idiot light lead was gone. How much damage could the PO
do in his 3 mo. of ownership? After 10 days of back and forth to work, I
bought and installed a sender. The oil pressure fluctuated wildly between
nil and 60 psi. The steering wheel is at such an angle that one spoke
blocks the view of the idiot light (how convenient and sinister!). Adding
oil smoothed it out; it went from full to very low in 10 days (=*0 . As
things warm up the oil pressure is around 28 psi at cruise and drops low
enough at idle to allow the idiot light to come on (about 10 on the gauge).
Power is still good and no harsh noises are detectable but my paranoid ear
thinks the valve noise is a leetle higher now.

Any suggestions of a fix? I plan to go to a full flow oiling system with
filter and new pump soon.

How long will it last? Shall we start a pool?

Regards,

Jim.
