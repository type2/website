&gt;I getting a clue than the wiper motor's on its way out?

you might want to try cleaning and regreasing the wiper arm shafts and
the joints on the wiper linkage first. when the grease gets old and cold,
it'll start doing that. with your bread-loaf dash, it's a snap to get up
under there to grease things.

words  of caution:
- don't use really thick grease ... it'll get cold and thick, too. use
   something that stays put but doesn't gum up in cold weather.
- when you take the wiper arm off (so you can push the shaft back in a
   little so you can get to it from under the dash to clean and regrease it),
   keep track of ALL those little parts.
- and don't take but one wiper arm loose at a time!! the whole mess can fall
   through if you take both loose at the same time. besides, you'll need one
   still in place to be able to figure out what order all those little pieces
   go back on. :)

you'd be surprised how much difference it makes with the wiper speeds.
(of course, it STILL could be the wiper motor!)
