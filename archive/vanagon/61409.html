Subject: Fridge ?

I started using my fridge for the first time this weekend and became somewhat
confused.  I plugged it in the night before we left, it was very cold.
 Switched to 12V for trip worked great again I then switched to propane when
I arrived, no problems.  My question is about the switch located behind my
drivers seat.  After listening to my radio I pulled the switch up to  check
how much battery power was left, it was at this point that I heard what
sounded like a fan, behind the fridge start.  Is this fan important, if that
is what I am hearing?  I was with two other Westy owners one had an 82 diesel
and the other had an 84 they told me that their fridges don't make any noise.
 My fan or noise goes on for a little then it shuts off as if it is
controlled by a thermostat.  Will it hurt to run it without the switch, to
the LED lights, in the on position.  I thought that maybe the fan is blowing
across the condenser, if these things have one, and that maybe the fan makes
the fridge more efficient but that it isn't necessary.  Any explanations
would be greatly appreciated.  I would really hate to hurt my fridge.  Thanks
in advance.
