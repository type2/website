Subject: Re: The shower thing :}

Larry and David, silly boys, write:

&quot;OK, I know that I'm just looking for trouble for posting this but what's up 
with
&gt; the shower thing?  Now don't get me wrong - I like showers, but WE'RE CAMPING
&gt;HERE PEOPLE!  Remember that this is California, where every other year seems 
to
&gt; be a drought.  What's wrong with roughing it for the weekend, conserving a
&gt; little H20 and enjoying a nice refreshing shower when you return to
civilization?  Besides, if the FRENCH can get away with only one shower per 
week
&gt; on average, can't we risk it for a couple of days?

I'm going to stick my (dirty) neck out here and agree with Larry.  I'm fine
going for a weekend without a shower if none is available.  When they *are*
available, I like two per day.  :)&quot;

ARE YOU GUYS *&amp;#^$&amp;*# NUTS?  Who do you think is going to be able
to share a campsite with you!????  :)
