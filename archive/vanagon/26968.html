Subject: pick a lane, any lane

Something for us slow-pokes to watch out for: the highway laws in Michigan
prevent semis from using the left lane.  On a two-lane interstate they'll
blast you for getting in their way in the RIGHT lane.  It took me awhile to
snap to this and move over into the LEFT lane to allow them to pass me on
the right.  Enforcing the &quot;no trucks left&quot; must take precedence over the
&quot;speed limit x&quot;.

Do any other states or locales have this law in effect?
