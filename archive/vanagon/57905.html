Subject: Re: Low brake pedal

&gt;What would cause 'low brake pedal'?
&gt;
&gt;I just got new rear drums &amp; brake shoes.  I've checked the brake fluid

brake shoes need adjusting.  put on the handbrake 2-3 clicks then tighten
adjusters until the drums won't turn.  Let off the hand brake and check for
rubbing. adjust again slightly if needed.  (Your handbrake cable may be way
out of adjustment so be ready to set it up too.) New shoes wear in rapidly
at first, you should break them in with gentle braking a few times. Check
adjustment again in a couple of weeks.  But if low pedal is still there
after first adjustment try bleeding them again. Tim
