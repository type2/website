Subject: Propane  (fridge) finally out


Fired up the fridge with a full tank of gazz on 3 May _at_ 5 pm.  Ran it 
continuously until the profane went out this morning, tho the 
evaporator was still frosty.

so... 3 May _at_ 5pm &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 23 May _at_ 7am     is er, well you do the math. 
 It ran a long time.
