Subject: I need to complete my 78 Westy

Hi folks:
I'm looking for two items that will complete the hardware inside of my Westy.
They are: 1.- Bench seat/storage box between the front seats
          2,- Small removable table in driver's cabin

If anybody has those parts for sale, please reply this message.

thanks

Angel
