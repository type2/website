From: Dave Mancuso &lt;Mancuso_at_etown.k12.pa_dot_us&gt;

Hello All,
Directions to this weekend's camping trip in eastern PA follow. I'm also 
putting them on my attempt at a web page, 
&lt;http://members.aol_dot_com/mancuso&gt;. Oh, there are some decent pictures of 
past vans on the page, too.

Directions to French Creek State Park:

All are certainly welcome for any part of the weekend they can make (they 
have 24 hour registration for camping). I'll be there from 7pm Friday 
till 1pm Sunday.

A good PA map is probably a must. I used the Rand McNally Road Atlas to 
help me make these directions. If you need further info, email me at 
Mancuso_at_aol_dot_com and I'll send you back a reply. I will be there by 7pm on 
Friday.

1. From most directions, it's probably best to get on the PA Turnpike 
(Rte. 76) (head East if coming from Harrisburg, head West if coming from 
Philly area). If I came up from Baltimore or points south, I'd probably 
take 83 north to Route 30 East (York, PA) to Route 222 North (Lancaster) 
to the turnpike and head East on the Turnpike (76).

2. Get to Exit 22. Take Route 10 south to Route 23 East. (PA road, little 
keystone icon sign). These roads are all pretty close to each other.

3. Take 23 East to 345 North (smaller PA road, not sure of the sign; 
might be keystone). this is only a few miles.

4. Take 345 north to French Creek State Park. You can get a site any time 
of night; they have 24 hr. registration. Sites are .

Dennis Haynes has offered to provide a seminar (the topic of emissions 
when I last emailed him), which is certainly of interest to those of us 
with emissions testing (or even we who want to make our vans just run 
right). I know I personally want to see his speaker system.

French Creek has trails, a lake (they might have boats out; I'm not 
sure), and historic Hopewell Furnace nearby.This is a state park, and 
sites are $10 per night for PA residents 
and $12 per night for non-PA residents.

The phone number for FCSP is 610-582-1514. (They're open 8am-4pm).
If anyone desperately needs to call me during the weekend (i.e your van 
broke down and you need help), I can give you my cell number, but it 
would probably cost me a dollar a minute for roaming charges.

I can tell by the stats that there are 12 of us in Eastern PA. 4 of us 
are accounted for; the rest of you, come on down!

Thanks!
Dave

PS-John Sharpe, my emails to you keep bouncing (ludwig.att_dot_com doesn't 
exist for my DNS server??). Send me a note when you get a chance. Hope 
your engine transplant is going well!
