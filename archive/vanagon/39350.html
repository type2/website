Subject: Jerry/stolen bus found!

responsible for hooking thousands of people on drugs and cultivating a
lifstyle that glorified substance abuse.

well, i missed this     :)

  jeez, get a grip.    

so - A friend of mine had his bus stolen about two months ago.  It was a 67
panel van, so straight and rust free it was amazing.  He went to California
to get it, and was driving it back to his home in BC.  Stopped to visit in
Lynnwood, WA, and it disappeared.  They told the police, but no dice.

   Then about a week ago the friend in Lynnwood found it two blocks from his
house, abandoned.  There was a bible in the engine compartment, pictures of
saints under the back seat, and dirty needles scattered around.   My friend
in Lynnwood put the bus in his driveway, but isn't touching it other than
that, as it's too freaky


if there were Grateful Dead T shirts left in it- you'd say the Dead made them
do it
