Perhaps the people we bus owners piss off the most are the ones who
race from red light to red light when driving in the city (and other
places with traffic lights).

I learned to drive in a '63 Bus, and learned at an early age to time
the approach to the traffic signal, so that I wouldn't have to stop.

Unfortunately (for the people behind me), it meant that I approached the
red light at 20mph or so, instead of the 45 or 50 that they wanted to
drive.  But I always breezed by the speedsters stopped at the red light
in the adjacent lanes when I blazed through the green light at 
20 or 25 mph!

This &quot;skill&quot; became useful later in life, when I bought a diesel Jetta.
