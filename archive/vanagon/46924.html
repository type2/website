Gordon,

I don't know how common the problem is, but mine did the same.  The 
heater control valve is probably stuck open, even though the lever is 
moved to the &quot;off&quot; position.  The control cable can get bent and then it 
will never be able to close the valve all the way.  Remove the glove box 
and shut the valve manually, then you have until winter, I guess, to 
trouble shoot the real problem.

&gt; My mother has a recently purchased '87 Vanagon Wolfsburg Ed. There is a
&gt; noticable and uncomfortable draft of warm air comming from under the dash.
&gt; I haven't seen the van, but she claims to be turning off all of the heater
&gt; controls. This is more and more annoying as temperatures rise in mid
&gt; summer.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a common problem? What's the diagnosis and what's the fix?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks in advance,
