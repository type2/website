Hey ya-all!

I see all these people out there with these PIAA lights....anybody have
them?  Do you like them?  What makes them so special?  Do they come in
other shapes....like 7 inch round?

RESPONSE
************************
IMHO the very best accesory light of a reasonable size, and not one of the
round type ever made was the CIBIE 175.  This thing would light up a football
field when a 100W bulb was used.  I had a pair of clear fogs.  I checked Yahoo
about a month ago for CIBIE and found a source that said they were still
available, at about $90 apiece.  The source eludes me for the moment, but
could be dug back up.

Well, that's my 2c's
