Subject: Can you please help me troubleshoot my fuel injection?

Hello Volks,

This is my first post as a havabusser. Up to now I have just been one of
those snivelling lurkers.;)

I have owned a 78 Westy, affectionately named Nellie, for the past three
months. She is my first vw and we quickly fell in love with each other --
that is up until last week.

For about 200 miles she would often stall a few minutes after being
started. Felt like low rpm and if I revved the engine for a while, the
stalling would go away. She never stalled when she was hot. She usually
stalled when the engine was around 120 degrees.

So, last week when she was at about 120 degrees she did something
different. She lost power and I was unable to rev her up and prevent
stalling. From then on, I have only been able to run the engine for about a
minute before she dies.

I bought this vehicle with no illusions that work would be involved.
Besides, I know I will enjoy her more if I know what the hell is going on
in the back.

Any suggestions as to what I should test?

Thanks in advance!

P.S. - I am in digest mode so please respond to me directly.
