&gt; The engine is running very rich during idle and haphazardly hesitates to
&gt; accelerate from a stop.  These symptoms have resulted in.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.      hesitation from stop to first
&gt; 2.	hesitation from first to second (happens less frequently than #1)
&gt; 3.	high hydro carbon emissions readings
&gt; 4.	high carbon dioxide emissions readings
&gt; 5.      very bad gas mileage.  
&gt; 
&gt; Dealer stated that it'll cost $320 total for the fix...  I have some
&gt; questions on the dealer's proposef fixes.
&gt; 1.      sticking throttle valve ($6.00 cleaner &amp; brush, 118.00 labor) 
&gt;         Q: Can just anyone find this throttle valve and clean it?  How
&gt; hard is it to locate and remedy?
&gt; 
&gt; 2.      seeping (seaping?) fuel line #3 ($22.00 parts, 78.00 labor)
&gt;         Q: Not yet leaking, but at this point seeping.  Any dangers in
&gt; replacing this thing?  
&gt; 
&gt; 3.      $79.00 Diagnosis fee
&gt; 
&gt; Main questions:  If you were me (a person who's not really too
&gt; knowledgeable yet... book's on the way from KevinS though... would you
&gt; tackle this project yourself and be able to do it in 1 to 2 hours? with
&gt; minimal danger?  Kind of worried about the fuel line since fire and fuel
&gt; equals possible boom :-)  
&gt; 
&gt; More stats on &quot;me&quot;:
&gt; 1.      Can do oil changes on the 84 vanagon... woohoo
&gt; 2.      replaced the coolant reservoir myself!
&gt; 3.      replaced alternator myself! 
&gt; These are the extent of my minimal expertise.  Can I perform the first
&gt; (throttle valve) and second (fuel line) myself?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks y'all!
&gt;

   One Question can you use an Ohm meter?
