Which kind(s) of filter does your Vanagon have, and which one(s) did you 
replace?  The Cal models are supposed to have the large silver cylinder 
(self-cleaning) type of filter, while the non-Cal are supposed to have 
the small plastic-bodied paper element type.  But I've seen Cal models 
with both, one in front of the pump and one behind.

When the van dies, and you try to start it, is it getting gas?
