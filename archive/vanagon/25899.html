Subject: Re: king and link pins (was Grendel)

     &gt; Also, this is going to sound like a silly question, but what is the 
     &gt; difference between link ping and king pin suspensions?  Or is there 
     &gt; any?
     
     Early buses -&gt; '67 had king pin suspension. Kingpin supsension 
     consists of a combination of king pins and link pins.
     
     
     
               =| |== link pin        O====|o|
                | |                        | |
     axle  =====| |                        |O|   
                | |                        | |
               =| |== link pin        O====|o|
     
                 \ king pin
     
     end view                         side view
     
     
     the king pin allows the front axle (wheel) to rotate and the link pins 
     which are a 90 degrees to the king pin allow the suspension to move up 
     and down. The link pins are attached to the two trailing arms shown 
     above and rotate up and down in parrallel.
     
     Post '67 buses were fitted with ball joints instead which allow this 
     kind of two axis movement with just a ball and socket.
