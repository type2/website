Maria and I took Saturday off and participated in the traditional BBTA
picnic expedition. Gorgeous weather! Since the River was low this time, we
got to do the double river crossing on ferries. Neat! A total of about 45
boxes participated in the caravan. We loved to watch the reactions of the
many other drivers who had to share the road with us. From anger to
disbelief to enchantment. Mostly impatience: one VW bus is bad enough, 45
is their worst nightmare come true :-O

And we got to meet many listmembers! The VANAGON_at_LENTI sign in the window
attracted those who knew its meaning. And so we met Bob Hufford and his
Dad, both from Springfield, MO; Tom Forhan et al. on their way back to DC
in a magnificent '90 Syncro Westy just purchased in Oregon; Pete Sellers
and S.O. Rose and their Eurovan Plaything; Jim Kirk with a '70? Riviera;
Richard Kurz from KC, MO; and Sean Roberts, joined by his Mom, came in a
cherry '78 Westy all the way from Ohio. It was nice to put faces on all
those electronic addresses :-)

Among the things for sale: a tent for $420 and a gas heater for $270. Too
expensive for me, and apparently for others, too, since it was still
available by the time we got there.
