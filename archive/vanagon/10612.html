&gt;&gt;A fine time for Unca Joel to get writer's cramp.  Here goes:

What does curb weight mean here? Does it mean its weight of just all its
equipments alltogether? Or does it include all it can carry including human
beings? I had the impression that there is a sticker somewhere in the driver's
door frame where a curb weight number is shown there. And in some countries
that curb weight is used to determine if it should be ticketed for over weight
when the vehicle is weighted in road check points. In other words, it is a
limit of total weight it should not exceed when it's loaded. The number for
vanagons is somewhere between 5000 to 6000 lbs. Am I correct?
