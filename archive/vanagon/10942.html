Subject: Re: What Size Socket?
Date: Tue, 31 Jan 1995 19:11:14 -0600 (CST)

&gt;What size are the rear axle nuts on a 1985 Westy? I don't have a 
&gt;wrench large enough so I figured that I might as well buy the 
&gt;&quot;proper&quot; tool.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;ray...
&gt;
It's 36 mm I think, but I had a socket on the bugger and a 3/4 in Craftsman
breaker bar with a long piece of pipe on the end of that, and all I did was
turn the breaker bar into a pretzel!!!

The really trick tool for the rear axle nuts is sold by Mofoco and I am sure
other VW shops, made by Bugpack.  It's a piece of 1/2-3/4&quot; plate steel with
a hex opening in it, and a square hole on the other end for a rachet/breaker
bar.  It also has two &quot;ears&quot; on it for you to beat upon with a hammer while
pulling/pushing with all of your might.  The tool only cost 8 bucks which is
far cheaper that said size socket.

Now that I've been thinking I think the size is 46mm.  Anyway, if you call
for the tool, they make it in two sizes, and you want the bigger of the two.

I have no interest whatsoever in the above mentioned product, except to say
that IT WORKS!!!
