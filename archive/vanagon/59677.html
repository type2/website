Subject: Manassas BUG OUT #38 Sun May 25th

Hello, All - I just wanted everyone to mark their calendars for &quot;THE BIGGEST
VW SHOW ON THE EAST COAST&quot; , in historic Manassas, Va - site of the famous
Civil War battle where many soldiers lost their lives, and the town in which
infamous John Bobbit lost his...er...uh...  :&lt;) 
Anyway, folks mark your calendars for Sun May 25th Which is the first BUG OUT
of the summer (the other one is held 1st wk in Sept)
This will be BUG OUT #38. 
It is held at Old Dominion Speedway in Manassas, Va (right across from the
National Guard Armory)
The show usually starts at 8am, vendors need to arrive earlier to set up. 
Large all-VW car show and swap meet with new and used VW parts vendors.
Drag races (bring your earplugs :&lt;) and judging and trophies for winning best
of show cars.
This is a very good show. ( I for one drive 6+ hours to get there from
Allentown, Pa     (yeah, my navigation skills suck...get lost EVERY time...
 :&lt;) 
Good chance to meet listmembers from all up and down the east coast - we
should set something up where listmembers can meet at a specific time and
location on the show grounds. 
For information call (703) 471-0559
I'll be posting more on this at the show nears...
