Oh yeah, in addition to my question about how to put the new window
in, there's one thing I forgot to ask.  How do I get the old window
out?  This is the Vanagon-style sliding window in the cargo door.  The
glass is broken out, but the aluminum frame is still being held in by
the rubber gasket.

I'm sorta thinking, get six hands, spread evenly around the edge of
the frame, and PUSH!  Would that be wrong?  I'd like to not destroy
the frame.
