&gt;If so, it's not a bad little van.  It's styling is nice, but it has those nasty

&gt;I think someone missed the boat on that one.

be warned that if you guys are talking about the Nissan Van, which looks like
the kinda squared-off Toyota and Mitsubishi Vans (sort of a smaller version
of the vanagon, with more of a slope on the front) ... Nissan has a buy-back
campaign on those vans. they had a lot of engine fires and so Nissan just
decided to buy them all back from the owners for about twice the suggested
'book' value. the local dealer has ten of them stuck back in a corner of his
lot. i have no idea what they are planning on doing with them.
