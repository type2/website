Subject: Pittsburg, PA?

Hey Group,
Well, my company has expressed some interest in moving me to
Pittsburg.  So, I have many questions....But for ya'll, they are Bus
related.

1. Is there emission testing/vehicle inspection in PA?

2. Any good import parts dealers in the area?

3. Any good junk yards?

4. Any laws that would make it unpleasant (like in NJ) to own an older
vehicle?

5.  Any registration penalties for older vehicles?

Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer!!
