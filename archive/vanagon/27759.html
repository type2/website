Subject: VW part number interpretation, or more engine ID
Date: Mon, 30 Oct 1995 23:34:20 -0700
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


I finally got to where I could read the part numbers on the tops of
the heads on my mystery engine.  They are 113 101 375 A, with either
61 or 71 on the next line (61 on the right head, 71 on the left).
Does this give enough information to determine what sort of exhaust
system I need?

The catalogs I've got give really generic descriptions, like ``69-71
1600dp''.  I know I've got something that's dual-ported, but I have no
idea of what the displacement is, or if it matters in this particular
case.  I suspect it does, as it's my belief that the displacement
differences are mainly achieved by varying the length of the cylinders
(distance along the axis).

More generally, as I know I'm going to have this problem a lot as my
bus project continues to grow, is there a translation somewhere from
part numbers to useful descriptions?  I've read the VW parts numbering
system guide from the archives, but that just gives a rough guide as
to how the numbers are constructed; it doesn't really say what
particular numbers mean (other than that I can generally ignore the
first trio of digits).

Thanks.
