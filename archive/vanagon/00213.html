Hi 1985 Westphalia here.

Mine did that for six months or more. Paid up and down the yin yang for 
their experimental opinions. Finally got it fixed after doing th ECU and 
ten other things. I've got so many receipts now I can't remember which 
one seemed to fix it. I'll try and look it up over next few days.

&gt; Well, I bought the wiring harness fix last Friday (thought that it couldn't
&gt; hurt) and the Van now has gone into it's idle hunt mode twice on Saturday,
&gt; and twice today (Monday).  It seems to be running better (when it runs
&gt; right).
&gt; 
&gt; I'm seriously thinking about selling this thing to some unsuspecting soul
&gt; and getting something different (Golf ///?)
&gt; 
&gt; What's going on???  Do I really have no other option than to replace the ECU
&gt; ($$$).  
&gt; 
&gt; I've replaced:
&gt; Air Flow Sensor
&gt; Fuel pressure regulator
&gt; Plug Wires ($$$)
&gt; Plugs 
&gt; Oxygen Sensor
&gt; Fuel Filter
&gt; Air Filter
&gt; Oil and Filter
&gt; I've cleaned every ground I can find (Weeelll, now that I think of it I
&gt; havn't cleaned the front strap from the tranny to the frame, but I did clean
&gt; the one from the left head to the frame)
&gt; Fiddled with the idle stabilizer
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing that I was wondering about was those stupid throttle
&gt; switches... I tested them a while back, and at that time they were fine.  I
&gt; priced them also... they were like $50 each!!! For a f*ckin microswitch.  I
&gt; just assumed that if they were that expensive and they seemed o.k. I would
&gt; leave them alone.  But now I am thinking along those routs again.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line....   Has anyone else had this problem and FIXED it??????
&gt; 
&gt; If so what did you do????  Or did the dealer just finally get it right for
&gt; you by replacing the whole wiring harness?!?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.  I'm slightly annoyed!!!
