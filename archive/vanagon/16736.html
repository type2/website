The opening/max opening temp of the thermostat is stamped on it, (of
course this means loosing some coolant to check, and you really otta put a
new O-ring in. If I were you I'd buy a new thermostat just in case...). I
think the thermostats come in only 2 temps, 80C and 87C.
Peak into your rad through one of the fan temp sender holes. See if it
isn't all crudded up. You're &quot;lucky&quot; you have a brass bodied rad, it can
be fixed.
Its because I just had my rad recored that these things are fresh in my mind.
