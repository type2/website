&gt;Just saw a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup ad on tv which featured an old guy
&gt;sitting in back of his parked split window, sort of winter camping/sort of
&gt;playing with some kind of electronic (tube era) equipment. A meteor thing
&gt;falls to earth in the background and the old grizzled guy gets out of his van,
&gt;looks around puzzled-like.
&gt;Don't know why, but I thought of Joel when I saw it :)
