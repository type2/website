Only stainless steel?  What about the copper nuts that VW claims is what your
'supposed' to use?  How well do they hold up?

After a while, the copper starts to corrode and wrenches will no longer fit.
 I find stainless nuts to be a real blessing as i've done much re-work to
exhausts i've repaired.  I've also found that good grade 10.9 or 12.9 bolts
hold up much better than oem junk.  Part of the grade specification includes
the quality of the plating.  Stainless bolts do tend to loosen occaisionally.
 The good bolts eliminate that problem.  Only real problem of stainless is
that it is difficult to cut or drill if needed.
