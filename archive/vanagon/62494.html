&gt;&gt;&gt;  Do the dealers still stock masks for Vanagons?

&gt;&gt;I doubt many dealers do, but I have them for $99.95, which is less than
the
&gt;&gt;dealers charged anyway.  
&gt;&gt;These are the genuine O.E.M. Volkswagen bras,


&gt; Ron,
&gt; 
&gt; Wolf had a different bra for later Vanagons with plastic bumpers. The one
for 
&gt; metal bumpers also clipped on in front of the doors where the plastic
bumpers 
&gt; would interfere. Thus I can't use my '87 bra on my '91.
&gt; 
&gt; Does the OEM bra work with both bumper types?
&gt; 


Yes, it fits '86-91.
