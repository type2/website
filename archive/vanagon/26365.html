Subject: non-technical - and I thought it didn't get better

	Volks,
	My sweetie Jean gave me one of the big Solido '66 Kombi
toys- 1:19 scale, for my birthday. I checked, it contained no nuclear 
weapons and so I'm keepin' it, even if it was made in France.

	Its beige-grey over red, with rear-view mirrors, wipers and
door-handles made out of aluminum sputter-coated plastic. The doors
and engine hatch are fixed closed but the back hatch open. Some engine 
detail, and the tires are soft, with tread. The front wheels turn, but 
the steering wheel doesn't appear to move. The grab-handle on the back
of the middle seat is present. Overall, very, very, neat!

	Cheers!
	Bill
