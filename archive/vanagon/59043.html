Subject: vanagon_dot_com update!

Howdy,

I just wanted to let people know that we're adding new stuff to vanagon_dot_com
daily.

In the 'Photos' section, you'll find a new section containing lots of
classic bus ads, as well as one ad for the Vanagon Syncro.

In the 'Info' section, I've been continually updating information on
Beethoven, my '90 Vanagon.  There is now an article describing my CB with
photos.  The 'Info' page also contains Jim Davis' excellent description of
how the Vanagon vent controls work, in the 'Articles and Essays' section.
Also in this section is a technical article on how coolants work and an
article on how to replace your own heads.

As always, you can check out the 'What's New?' page for day-by-day
information on what's being added.

As always, http://www.vanagon_dot_com/

Ron
