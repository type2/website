Subject: LiMBO Rites of Spring at Carlisle,PA 

Hi Volks,
   I thought I might pass along an event that LiMBO is planing.  Its
called the 'LiMBO Rites of Spring'  Its going to be held at the Carlisle
Import and kitcar Show in Carlisle, PA. May 9th -11th. If you register
with the show promoter before April 15th (tax day)  The weekend only
cost 5 dollars. That includes camping and admission to the show for 2
adults.  If anyone is interested please either e-mail me or Dale Ward
&lt;LiMBOBUS_at_aol_dot_com&gt; for more info.  Take care
