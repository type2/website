&gt; 
&gt;   I'm looking at buying an 82 Diesel Westfalia (asking for trouble?).
&gt; It has it's problems but it should meet my needs.  The major problem
&gt; is that it is overheating.  I was just talking with a mechanic and he

Since Stephen Smith is on sabbatical, I will lead the charge for Diesels...

Before you decide, answer these questions

1) Does 30 MPG sound better than quick acceleration?

2) Do you even *care* about platinum spark-plugs?

3) Do you drive real fast?

I have had my NuBus ('82 Diesel) since March. When I first got it,
NuBus spewed diesel fuel from 3 places, and Oil from 3 other places.

I fixed the diesel leaks, but the oil leaks were due to massive blow-by
in the engine. For non-bunker burners, the compression ratio in the
diesel is 3 times that of the gasoline engine. This means that when
air blows-by the rings, it is under a great deal of pressure. This pressure
goes past the pistons, into the engine. It pushes out seals and valve
cover gaskets. Eventually, a piston in this engine &quot;blowed-up good&quot;, and
I put another engine in... (OK, I paid for my FLAG to do it..)

I seem to have adequate heat. The engine now purrs. It leaks nothing.
Make sure you check for blow-by (pull the valve-cover vent and feel for a 
rush of air..)

Other than oil-changes, this is a zero maintenance engine. Don't drive fast
though. You should get 200K out of it if you don't abuse it. I love my
Diesel, and my wife and I still fight over who gets to drive it. 

My $0.02...

p.s. Pay somebody to figger out the overheating *before* you buy. It is
    *real* hard to get this engine hot. I don't think my 'lectric radiator
    fan has _ever_ come on...
