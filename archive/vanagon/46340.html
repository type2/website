ALL,

WANTED :  DIESEL WESTY

I've been creeping around the list here for about a month picking brains,
listening in and being a general bother.  What a great community of folk I've
discovered out there.  Thanks to everyone for their help and info.  I think
tsmith (aka RICH LANG WEB GOD OF THE WEEK AWARD winner the week before last),
after an exhaustive exchange of mails, has finally helped me narrow my focus
to the beauty that will get me off the ground, meet my  globe trotting needs,
and fit in my budget.

Looking for a diesel Westy, folks.  Something in great shape and priced for a
brother in arms - or on wheels, shall we say.

I look forward to hearing from anyone who can do me right on this one, and as
a reward I'll stop by your house and cook you a fine italian dinner or give
your wife or girlfriend a full body massage.  What the hell, I'll throw em
both in.

Thanks,

Rich
