Subject: INDEX format




Now that &quot;Whatshisname&quot; is back, I'd like to reopen the thread regarding 
making an INDEX option available on the list.  My other active list sends 
out one message per day with the titles and reference no.'s.  You order the 
messages you want by sending back the following batch file to the listserver:

//       JOB
Database search DD=Orders
//Orders DD *
Select * in &lt;listname&gt;.&lt;message no. range&gt;
Print &lt;type the numbers of the messages you want here&gt;
/*
//       EOJ

This option is user selectable by sending a command to the listserver:

SET &lt;listname&gt; INDEX

I would be happy to put Gerry in touch with the listowner to get the 
details. I have been very happy with this option on my other active list.
