Subject:      ok then. what would YOU buy for $300,000?

well, as long as it is email-monopoly-money anyway, what would you guys and
gals buy if you had the $300,000 that clown wanted to spend on ONE auto-
mobile. ONE, i said.   i can't imagine paying that much money for a car,
and then taking it out on the highway with all those other idiot drivers.
and what about insurance!!!! can you imagine the deductible!??

so anyway, what would you buy? but it's got to be all spent on car(s). no
houses, garages, real estate, etc.

me? i think i would try to get one of each of the vanagon models:
vanagon GL (already got)
vanagon GL Camper ............ $16,000
vanagon GL automatic ......... $13,000 (around here, anyway)
vanagon panel van ............ $13,000 (got to import it from canada)
vanagon double-cab pickup .... $15,000
vanagon single-cab pickup .... $13,000
and maybe some syncros:
vanagon GL camper syncro  .... $19,000
vanagon syncro double-cab .... $19,000
vanagon syncro single-cab .... $17,000
                  total       $125,000

hmmmm. got a ways to go, don't i?  ok then we'd start with all the models of
the bread-loafs! and then the split-windows!! yeah!! can you just imagine ALL
of those buses out in the yard!!! mine! all mine!! nyahahahahahahahahaha!!!
&lt;pause&gt;

can you just imagine the insurance agent's reaction??? :) it would probably
only cost me about $20K a year for insurance on all of them. and i wouldn't
be able to hold down a job ... i'd be out driving them each for an hour a
day. or changing oil. or something. hmmmmm. well, i'd just have to start a
museum. ;)
