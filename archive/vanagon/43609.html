Subject: Re: Microbus replacements

I have Delux 21 windows Micro bus walk thur with ragtop. The nose and doors 
are badly smashed so I would like to know is it possible to use kombi bus 
doors and nose to replace the microbus? I noticed that the dashboard of 
microbus has more features than the other bus. What year will it fit 
to replace the nose and the door for the '65 microbus? Anyone out there 
sells the nose also doors for the microbus.

the front doors are the same 64-67.   as long as the door handle has the push
button rather than the handle that pulls out, youre okay.   the 66-67 front
ddors are slightly different, actually, as they have a pull handle on the
inside, but that only affects the holes for the door panels clips for the
handles, are are perfectly fine for a 65.  deluxes came with the belt trim,
so if you find a door from a not deluxe, you'll have to drill holes to mount
the trim.  
(i have some spare doors - in western washington)

use a nose from a 62-67 bus.      one with the fried eggs turn signals. 

   the dash is different between models in that the deluxes came with a
clock.  also in 65 they got emergency lights.   but if you find say, a nice
63 kombi nose, use it and measure and cut holes for the clock &amp; emergency
light switch.
