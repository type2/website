Subject: on buying a car


This from my type 181 thing list; thought it might be of interest to
the wannabe's on THIS list:

&quot;I decided to buy my Thing (the Pickle!) three years ago.
     (My wife owned a '67 Beetle; seeing the Things around
     and in magazines had lit the fire inside me about five
     years earlier...)  At that time, there was a new service
     available (at least here in SoCal) called
     1-800-CAR-SEARch.  You called the number, told them what
     you were after, and they checked their database for any
     and all matches within X miles of your location.  They
     would mail or fax the results to you.  At that time, the
     service was free to the buyer.  (The seller would pay to
     list his vehicle.)

     The service still exists, but now I think they charge
     the buyer for the service. (Don't know how much...)
     According to their radio ads, they also have all the
     listings for autos-for-sale out of all the local papers.


     Anyone know if the service exists outside of SoCal?
