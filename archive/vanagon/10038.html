&gt;Chris, I see where you got some good advice on where to shop for a 
&gt;rebuild kit.  The list, however, only got one of these responses, that
&gt;I saw.  Could you please let me know what else you found out?  Thanks,
&gt;Jim

True true.  I am really torn about what to do.  The case is out at the 
machinist to get line bored, and will be back tomorrow around 5 pm.  plenty 
of time to get an order to colorado or cali.  Money is tight, and this tends 
to not look in The Bus Stop's favor.  They look real expensive.  I've been 
leaning toward Performance Specialties, as they have low prices.  It seems 
to me that a new head is a new head, no matter how much you pay.  
Remanufactured parts are another thing completly, Who knows whos been 
working on that crank or connecting rod set?

I've been considering ordering just the engine kit from Mofoco or the bus 
stop, and ordering the other parts like heads, etc. from someone cheaper.

By the way, over the summer, I built a homemade parts washer, (that is a 
motorized pump for those smarties).  I'll post the details if anyone is 
interested.

If y'll got any advice, now is the time for it!
