&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyone have any ideas on better ways to recharge the aux. battery?
&gt; &gt; When stopped, my fridge drains it in less than 3 hrs.  Does anyone have
&gt; &gt; a three battery setup?

&gt; Hi, is your aux battery a &quot;deep cycle&quot; battery? where did you get it?
&gt; how much? was it easy to install? Thanks for any information,

Hi there, Rick!
In answer to your questions:  When I first bought my '79 Westy it was
already wired for an aux. battery, so I can't shed much light on EXACTLY
how the whole (engine+alternator+battery+wiring=juice inside the bus to
run the cool electric appliances) setup works, but I'll tell all I know.
I installed a regular gel-cell battery in the engine compartment, this is
all that would fit in my engine compartment.  As I stated in my original
post to the list it only ran my fridge for about 3-4 hours when the 
engine was turned off, for that I might as well just have an icebox and 
save myself the electric headache.  Nevertheless I have recently been 
informed by an ever-so-kind fellow VWer that a &quot;deep cycle&quot; battery would 
do a much better job and, furthermore, that it is possible to install it
somewhere else, where it will fit.  Tentatively, I am considering 
installing it under the driver seat, a design I believe I am copying 
from late model campers.  I intend to leave the other battery in its 
place, simply because it'll just be harder to remove it and clean up
all the wires, than to just leave it there and know that I have a spare 
battery and an extra source of power, b/c one never knows what situations 
might arise...
I'll keep you posted on my little porject.
Any other way I could be of service, you may find me in my domain...
