Subject: Gas in oil? UPDATE

I know that this thread is probably gone far enough, but I still don't
seem to be able to isolate the problem completely.  Here's a recap to
date:

a couple of weeks ago when I was driving home from work, the engine on
my 82 westy suddenly started running very rough, smoking and would die
if I took my foot off the gas.  I checked my temp sensors, no problem
there. I checked all the fuel injector connections, everything seems to
be OK there also.  I cleaned the inside of the AFM and the butterfly
valve seems to be moving freely. No O2 sensor is part of the system,
apparently not part of the 82 aircooled system.  Gas still seems to be
getting into the oil.  OK, here's the wierd part...  When the key is on,
I can hear and feel gas running through the fuel lines, apparently going
into the pistons.  When I disconnect the AFM, the fuel stops running. 
It will idle fine with the AFM disconnected, but of course will not
drive that way.  I have pretty much decided that the AFM is bad (has an
intermittant problem, since it only does it after driving a while 5-10
minutes) and I need to replace it.  Does anyone have any experience with
this?  Do you think I'm on the right track?  Thanks!
