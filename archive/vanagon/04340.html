&gt;
&gt;Does _anyone_ out there know where I could find a suitable tow hitch (Class
&gt;1) so I don't have to go out and fabricate one myself?
&gt;
&gt;I would be so grateful, I might just stop by on my way across and buy you a
&gt;few beers!
&gt;
&gt;Please to be emailing me at  yeebot_at_aol_dot_com  because I no receive digest
&gt;anymore (at least til I get a comany acct!)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all,
&gt;Mike

Mike -
  Did you ever receive any response on this??  I'm also interested in a 
tow hitch for a light duty utility trailer, to fit my 79 Van??

Could you email me any info - or let me know if you got none, so that I 
can begin to design/commission/steal a suitable hitch???

  Good luck on your trip!!
