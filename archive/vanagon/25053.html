Subject: low compression _at_ no. 1 &amp; 3

Hi,

My '83 Vanagon/water-boxer overheats.
Its no. 1 &amp; 3 compression reading is 55
while no. 2 &amp; 4 have ~120. Is the headgasket
inbetween 1 &amp; 3 cracked? I'm in Sunnyvale,
can folks in this area suggest some good shop
in Santa Clara/Mtn. Views/Sunnyvale?

If you have some personal experience on
this type of vehicle/sympton, could you
give me some ideas?

Thanks.
James
