On Fri, 13 Oct 95 08:42:57 CDT William Kennedy mumbled:
&gt;box car children?

hmmm. food for thought. especially since all the buses are shaped like
boxes. and the first three generations had a &quot;boxer&quot; engine (flat,
horizontally-opposed cylinders ... even Bill's Porsche engine fits. :)

maybe BoxKar?         Boxer?  Boxer-Shorts?
      BoxKinder?

and, of course, if buses were considered &quot;light&quot;, as in made-of-aluminum,
why then we'd be   &quot;Boxites&quot;. :)  &lt;groan&gt;

but the 5-cylinder Eurovan's don't fit this convention ... but being bigger
than our little 4-cylinder boxers, maybe the EV's are just &quot;crates&quot;???  :) :)
&lt;chortle/snuffle/guffaw/giggle!&gt;

of course, the more liberal politically-correct of you might be upset about
this ... since it was a B-29 named &quot;Bock's Car&quot; that dropped the 2nd atom
bomb on Japan in WWII.
