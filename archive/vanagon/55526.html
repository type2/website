Subject:  Re: VW Alloy Wheels

&gt;  The alloy wheel
&gt;also needs tapered lug bolts and nuts, not rounded.  I'm not sure that
&gt;this is absolutly necessary but that's what I've been told.  The lug bolts
&gt;off of Saab 9000's work fine, the lug bolts from the Audi 5000 have a
&gt;rounded head. 

Everybody, keep in mind that Cory's talking about mounting a &quot;Carat&quot; V-gon
wheel, not a Audi turbo wheel. 
Also, I would imagine, if one was to purchase a set of used Vanagon &quot;Carat&quot;
style 5 spoke alloys, they would be smart enough to get the lug nuts and bolts
too, therefore your problem would be solved......

If you're mounting a Audi turbo wheel, then it IS PREFERABLE to use the Audi
turbo lug bolts on the front of the V-gon.
