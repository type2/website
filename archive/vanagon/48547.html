&lt;&lt; Anybody out there have a good idea for a bicycle rack for the back of 
 the Vanagon? &gt;&gt;

You can buy one that mounts in a class III reciever hitch.  Which you can buy
from a guy named Dennis Haynes for $225 including shipping.  I bought a hitch
from him and it went in &quot;slick as a whistle&quot;  _No_ problems at all mounting
it up.  Excellent quality, service, etc.  Do I sound like a satisfied
customer yet?  I am.  

If I remember right his address is Dhaynes_at_AOL_dot_com.  Tell him I sent you.

Oh, when you are not using it to haul bikes it also doubles as a trailer
hitch so you can pull a trailer!!
