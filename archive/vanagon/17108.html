&gt;i am looking for the following:
&gt;        late model/low mileage non-westy syncro diesel or gas
&gt;        any location is o.k.

this fellow on the list is regrettably having to sell his:
Michael Plickys,  plickys_at_aol_dot_com
he's in Ellington, CT

if you can get to the local public or college library and check out the
newspapers from various cities (usually in the reference or periodical
section), look particularly at the san francisco and seattle areas.

also this guy in kentucky keeps advertising in the VW Club of America:

1986 Vanagon Syncro Van, a/c, tinted windows, very nice, 100K miles,
asking $4500. Call Bill (302) 438-4322. if no answer, leave message.

(oddly enough, he also has an add for a 86 syncro camper with 67k miles)
good luck.
joel
