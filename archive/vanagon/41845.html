Subject: Re: Bus Boys comes thru Pt 2

I did forget to mention that we do have 2 other people that work in our
Manufacturing Shop, but don't go anywhere near the phones 'cause they're
workin' their butts off 6 days a week building beams, swing axle kits, irs
kits, safari windows (80 sets 2/3ds the way finished), steering boxes,
spindles, balljoint torsion arms, springplates (new item!) and trying to keep
the antiquated hot tank running.  Their names are Walt &amp; Laura and yes
they're a husband and wife team that beats anyone else that's worked here in
over 2 years.  I mean we really had some &quot;winners&quot; here before that took
forever to get stuff built.  With these two, I rarely have to jump their
butts because they keep their part of the rocky ship afloat.
By the way, in case y'all are wonderin' just how big (in building size) we
are, here's some facts:  Front Office and Main Warehouse - 1200 square feet
(and it's packed to the ceiling); Manufacturing Shop with small area for
warehousing - 2500 square feet.  Plus we have additional storage elsewhere
for bulk items we make and buy from overseas and here in the states. Oh how I
would love to be in a larger, single central building for better efficiency.
 Keep on flamin' :)  Jim / BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com
