Subject: Vanagon Single/Double Cab wanted
Date: Mon, 28 Apr 1997 20:45:55 -0500

Well, the Double cab turned out to be a 1963 Chevy (go figure), so I am =
looking for a single or double cab, double cab preferred, Vanagon or =
bus.  I am really looking for a 2WD Vanagon Double cab w/1.9 or 2.1 l =
H2O, but I would be interested in just about anything.  I live in the =
St. Louis area and would like to find one near here, with in a 3 hour =
drive.  I am not looking for one in perfect condition or anything, just =
one that has all four wheels and an engine.  It doesn't even have to =
run.  If I can't find a Vgon I want an 82-84 A1 GTI, I know these cars =
are quite different, but I have my reasons.

Thanks in advance
