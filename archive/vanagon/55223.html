Subject: Re:  Turn Signal Flasher Replaced-Wipers NG

To Jeff Diebolt:  BINGO!  You were correct.  I had plugged the new turn 
signal flasher into the socket for the intermittant wiper relay.  Had I 
bothered to LOOK at the Bentley before performing this procedure, I would 
have seen in the photo that the turn signal flasher is the left-most of 
the units on the top of the fuse block.  But then I wouldn't have learned 
as much about programmable delay units as I now have 8-)  For the record, 
the part number on the original flasher unit that I replaced is 111 953 
227D, while the wiper delay relay is the xxx 955 xxx as described in 
Jeff's posting of 1/28.  All's well that ends well:  put the new flasher 
unit into the correct socket, reinstalled the wiper relay into its 
socket, and both flashers and wipers now operate properly.  Now, off to 
try to find one of those after-market programmable delay relays.  Thanks 
to all who provided advice.
