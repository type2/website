&gt;Should I start looking for joints, roaches, and other drug related stuff in 
&gt;his toy box?

Well at the age of three, and with you (hopefully) as his main role
model, if you're doing what you think is right, I'd be more worried
about his taking and hiding/using the keys to the bug and van, than
looking for plant matter or needles in his toy box:)
