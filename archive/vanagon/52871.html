Subject: thanks

To all those who gave input about auto trans.  a big and hearty thanks.
except for the volume of mail, this is a great mailing list. lots of info.
and lots of fun to boot. will enjoy being here. does get a little hot
sometimes.

now another question. can i get armrests or seats with armrests for my
vanagon? Is it possible to order the table from the camper version for the
&quot;plain&quot; version?
