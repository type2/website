Subject: RE: 911-Drivetrain in 66 Micro??


&gt;I was thinking about putting a Porsche-6 and maybe trans in my Micro. I 
know
&gt;that it can be done in a vanagon, but I'm not sure if it would work in my
&gt;bus.  Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Listmember Bill Kennedy in New Jersey, has put several different
Porsche-6 engines in his '81 Vanagon, and I have an '81 Chevy 2800
V6 from a Citation, in my '80 Vanagon.

I know, different transmission from your '66, and ours have rear engine
mounts which yours doesn't. But if you write him directly, maybe he
can give you some info? For my part, I would be happy to help out
with info also, some of which might be useful despite our different
engines and applications.

You might also call Kennedy Engineered Products in California.
They advertise in the small ads in the back of HVWs.

It's soooo nice to cruise up hills at 70 in 4th...   :^)
