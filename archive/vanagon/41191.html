Subject: intermittant wipers?
Date: Thu, 2 May 96 20:45:15 EDT

Hey all,
I know this thread has been discussed before, but I was flipping through
the RMMW catalog and they are selling the intermittant wipers relay for
$39.95 for the 73-79 buses.  Am I right in thinking that this just plugs
in to the spot for the current wiper relay??  Is there some kind of pin
in the wiper switch that can be removed so that it goes down when you
pull it down??  I'd really love to have intermittant wipers :)

Anybody done this?

Sean
