Subject: Re: VIRUS ALERT


Ahh...the folklore of the internet is once again being spread...
the &quot;Good Times Virus&quot; is up there with the Easter Bunny, Santa Clause, and
that poor kid dying of cancer in the UK who wants to get in the Guinnes Book 
of World Records for collecting the greatest number of (you choose) business 
cards, birthday cards, get well cards, etc....
