&gt;Subject: gex rebuilds

What does GEX REBUILDS have to do with your note? Was this motor a rebuild
from GEX? Are you planning to get a motor from GEX? I'm thinking of buying
one of their long blocks so this info would help. Thanks.

&gt;          motor on my '66 kombi is out and apart.  it was a 1600SP
&gt;          with a 28PICT-1 in a universal T1,2,3 case with a doghouse
&gt;          cooler.#4big end bearing spun and became part of the crank.
&gt;          there are two cylinder studs on #3 that came out in my hands
&gt;          (no wrench required), two helicoils in cases, several small
&gt;          cracks in cases, cracked head, and the cam shows wear.  the
&gt;          carb has a worn throttle shaft.
&gt;          i'm looking for a long block plus a carb.  gex offers a 1600
&gt;          SP with dual oil relief.  i'm thinking about putting a
&gt;          31PICT-3 on it.  any experienced opinions on quality and
&gt;          customer service on these motors and about my carb choice?
&gt;          the bus already has converted to 12v.  what do you think
&gt;          about flushing the existing oil cooler and using it again?
&gt;          if i end up replacing oil cooler is the extra $ for german
&gt;          vs brazilian worth it?   thanks ray
