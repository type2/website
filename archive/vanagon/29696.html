Subject: Re: swapping Splitty speedo's??

if the speedo came out of a 64-67 bus there should be no calibration needed.
  64-67 buses came with 14&quot; wheels,  unless specially requested.  55-63 came
with 15&quot; wheels,  so in a bus with 14&quot; it'll be off.  There should be a date
on the back of the speedo.
