Subject: Barndoors in Dumb Blondes and Hokey VW's

I finally picked up a copy of this useless rag, the only reason in doing so
was because of the blurp David &quot;the Nerd&quot; Heard wrote on the Sacramento
barndoor contingent.  Of course he left off my name, since I refuse to kick
down the cash to join ghoSTO.  He also left off altogether another '54
standard (which live a few blocks from me) that I'm sure he knows about.
One of our lurking listmembers is outed in this issue also, although its
purported to be a '55, its actually about 1000 numbers earlier than my '54,
making it the oldest barndoor in Sacramento.     

To add further to the insult, all this came out in the &quot;swimsuit issue.&quot;
Reminds me!  I gotta pick up some silicone for the 56's windsheild...
