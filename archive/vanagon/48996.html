Subject: aux battery installation info for 89 Westy

Hi y'all.  I've been looking for installation infor, and parts required for
adding auxillary battery under driver's seat, as mentioned in my owners
manual of 89' Westy.  I've also noticed that there's mention of aux. bat. in
large Bentley for this year.  It has wiring diagram, showing routing, but I'm
dumb to this, and would like to find step by step proceedure required.  Too
many times, I've had to jump start because I didn't realize that stereo might
be on low, or whatever.   I carry jumpers, but the aux battery seems like the
perfect solution..    Any know-hows out there, or directions of who to
contact for what I seek?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
