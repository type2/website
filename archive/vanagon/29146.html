Subject: Re: Which is the outside lane?


&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought the question was:&quot;Which is the outside lane?&quot;, not, which is 
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;fast/slow lane.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Pat, Pat, Pat...in VW bus terms the outside lane IS the fast
&gt;&gt;lane, because there is only an outside chance you will ever
&gt;&gt;drive there in a VW bus!
&gt;
&gt;     I'm sorry, I'm still thinking in Audi Quattro terms.
&gt;
&gt;     Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpa
                                ^^^^^^
Isn't this a Nissan term?
