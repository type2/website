Subject: Generator to Alternator Conversion....

Hello all..
    I have a '72 Bus that I am trying to fix up for a variety of 
purposes. I have been having trouble with the charging system, and I 
would like to upgrade to a high-output alternator, as I plan to run 
Hella driving lights and a fairly powerful stereo as well as other 
eletrical gadgets. As it happens I have no idea how to go about this, 
but I am fairly mechanically adept as well as having friends who are 
even more so. Any tips, suggestions, plans (dare I hope), or horror 
stories would be greatly appreciated.
