Subject: Re: westy table

Anybody got a table to measure? There's enough of an aftermarket to 
figure out how to duplicate the missing tables and buy a 2&quot; ad in Hot VWs 
or the other one...

&gt; &gt;           i found a westy table in very good shape at a local
&gt; &gt;           unauthorized vw repair shop (luvwrs?).  amazingly it has
&gt; &gt;           survived in spite of windows being gone from this bus.  the
&gt; &gt;           shop owner wants to sell but doesn't know how to price.  i
&gt; &gt;           told about this list and he actually suggested i inquire as
&gt; &gt;           to it's value with y'all and bring him a reasonable dollar
&gt; &gt;           amount.  i got him to take it inside out of the elements and
&gt; &gt;           it awaits.  so, anyone got any ideas as to value?  i'm lost
&gt; &gt;           but want the darn thing.  thanks   ray  gainesville, fl
&gt; &gt;           oh yeah, it's the big table that folds up on the driver's
&gt; &gt;           side about midway back.
&gt; 
&gt; So a wise acre who knows nothing about the relative value says $1.98.  To 
&gt; make the buyer happy and $200.00 to make the seller happy.  Okay I'll 
&gt; shut up now.
