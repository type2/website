Subject: re: :) Jettas

I'd just like to pile on in support of the lowly Jetta. I bought mine
before it was fashionable to have them, way back in 1982. My girlfriend at
the time told me it was an &quot;old man's car&quot;. She bought one herself in 1986!

It was a great car, even if a bit under powered, but it took me faithfully
everywhere I wanted to go. I pretty much scoured the paint off the front of
the car because I took it skiing so much!

I put over 160,000 miles on it, with no engine work at all.

Just my $0.02!
