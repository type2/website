Subject: Haunted 84 adventurewagon

My 84 hi-top seems haunted...I drive along for 10-15 minutes, the boheamoth
stalls, no power. Crank it over and over, lots of blue smoke (oil pulled up
into cylinders by trying for a restart while going from 65 to zero?). Let
it sit for 20 minutes or so(heat gauge to nill), pump the pedal while
cranking it,(ist verboten mit fuelinjection, right?) and it starts, no blue
smoke anymore.  I take off and 10 minutes later it stops again.  It takes
three hours to get home with this charming procedure (good thing it had a
full refrigerator and library!).  It acted up a bit the day before, but the
day before that it ran perfectly fine (tank was full that day).  This has
been an ongoing problem since just after I got it three months ago, with
fixes including fuel filter(s), temp sensor 2 replacement, relay.  It was
losing power on the hills, only to run fine down the backside.  Does this
sound like the coil problem experienced by others, or am I running out of
gas with 1/3 of a tank?  All the cranking-over produced no gas smell in the
engine compartment.

That was Saturday. Today in the shop, it started right up ran to be moved
to a different parking space.

Any Vanagon exorcists out there?
