&gt;So, I'm driving down the street when I see this old flat-faced Van, of
&gt;American marquee (I know not which).  Then I notice that there are vents
&gt;towards the back of it.  Then I notice that it's a rear-engined beast and
&gt;sounds very much like an old Corvair (!).
&gt;What Gives?

back in the 60's, when GM decided to try to copy VW with the Corvair, they
did make a van version ... and even a pickup version. called the Briarwood
(i think that's correct), it was indeed a flat-faced (with a somewhat silly
&quot;face&quot; on the car. imho) van with the air-cooled engine in the rear.

i'm somewhat amazed that (1) any are still left, and (2) it's still running
around.  actually, i've always been kinda p.o.'d at GM for canceling the
Corvair ... i thought it was a pretty good little car. well, my cousin had
one, anyway, and it was a Terror-Weapon!!!! :) Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaast!!!
(it was the 2nd generation, with the much better looking body).
