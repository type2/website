Subject: RE: How to Steal VW Vans Quickly

&gt; I replaced the thieves-attracting face plate with an ugly, generic one and
&gt; replaced the ergonomically shaped designer knobs &lt;grin&gt; with old, clunky
&gt; ones. Worked well so far.

I had to use VW-radio knobs on my pioneer (didn't have any, itself)... even
when I had the radio sitting on the dash with a tangle of wires under it
because I didn't get around to installing it right, I didn't have any theft
problems.

And if I lock the doors, it takes 10 minutes and a screwdriver to unlock
'em again...
