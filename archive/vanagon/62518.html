Subject: Re: For the dreamers ... TDI emissions


&gt;&gt; A properly tuned TDI motor should not smoke and is very clean, emissions-
&gt;&gt; wise.  It's real appeal (to me, anyway) is that it has diesel mileage
&gt;&gt; coupled with gas engine performance (i.e. doesn't have a 0-60 of 20 secs.
&gt;&gt; or whatever it is).

&gt;My next door neighbor has always bought the latest VW, and now she has
&gt;a new Passat TDI. The car puts out a LOT of smoke. It is not a heavy black
&gt;smoke, but more greyish; it still stinks pretty badly however. She
&gt;says she gets nasty looks all the time. She also has had a few people
&gt;honk the horn and hold their nose when they pass her car. The car is
&gt;very well maintained by the excellent local VW dealer, and runs perfectly.

&gt;The most smoke is on acceleration from a stop. Out on the highway, smoke
&gt;is less noticable, but still smells badly. But, then, so do M-B's.

TDI engines produces a lot of smoke, I can see this on German roads.
Usually when they are cold or under heavy load. That's not a problem
of the 'next door neighbour'.
