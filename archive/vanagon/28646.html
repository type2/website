Subject: Re: Seat Belts


&gt;I personally wouldn't be here today if not for seat belts.  A drunk driver
&gt;ran a red light one night in San Antonio in '83, hit me from the front at
&gt;about a 30 degree angle (almost head-on), his lights were off, etc., and I
&gt;didn't even see him coming.  The length of the engine compartment from the
&gt;windshield to the front bumper was about 4 feet after the crash, the engine
&gt;went downward and back, the door on the passenger's side was so mangled that
&gt;the passenger had to get out my side...she had a broken arm, I had a scratch
&gt;on one knee (we both wore seat belts).  The drunk driver of the other car was
&gt;wearing his belt, and didn't get a scratch.  His passenger was not, and is
&gt;paralyzed from the waist down.
&gt;
&gt;I'll wear 'em every time, and the van doesn't move until all passengers are
&gt;buckled up, too.

I've always been worried bout this kind of crash in my Westy.  Can't
imagine surviving front end impact like that even with seat belts fastened
(always do).

Was hit broadside in an intersection, just ahead of the rear wheel in my 72
Westy, prolly the best place to be hit - right on the end of the frame
crossmember.  Spun the bus 180 degrees, and I drove away, after repairing
shifter which was 90 degrees out, pointed at me instead of aft.  Bus
suffered only sheetmetal damage, no alignment problem at all.
