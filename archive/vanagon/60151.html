Subject: Spare tire gas can.

Hi guys.
I think I scored this weekend. Just by chance I stopped at a garage sale
and found a german tire gas can (&quot;Doughnut Tank&quot;), like the ones
mentioned in a recent thread, NEW, with its original box and paperwork,
for $10! (I remember quotes for around $70 in the list) Kraftstoff brand
(?), excelent quality, 1-1/2 gallons capacity. Apparently imported by
Stainless Steel Brakes Corp.,NY. (716)759-8666.
Fits great inside the Westie's spare. It made my weekend!
Later,
Cris.
