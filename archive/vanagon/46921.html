&lt;odd..me, responding to to at once!&gt;

barry, glen  expounds upon one of the point i tryed to make in the 
beginnning.

for those of you who remember, only a few years ago, when acessing the 
internet took either a college account, or a big buisiness, or the 
knowhow to get through the back doors, back when NSCAMOsaic was the only 
thing with which you could see the graphics on the web, and even then, 
either a t work or at school, because providers were still providing UN*X 
sheel accounts to the poor exstudents who missed what they had, but SLIP 
&lt;and now PPP&gt; had not yet migrated out of the upperechelon, and so we had 
to deal with &lt;gasp&gt; text for everything, but wait...i ramble..sorry.

point being that with the quite easy access to the internet for all the 
AOL,CIS,GE,GNN,ETC users out there, more of the &quot;kids&quot;, if you know what 
i meen, and the money seekers, now flood everything. here, you pull that 
to often, and &quot;pop&quot; somebody who can just unsubscribes them. for the 
community. but on Usenet, there is really hardly anything one can do &lt;oh, 
well, except run a moderated group &lt;which not only defeats the purpose, 
but woud definity killl hte community&gt;&gt; to keep them out.

and another thing, when you are in a hurry, and just pop through the 
messages, even then, you stop and npotice. why? BECAUSE! its EMAIL! its 
to YOU! personally. or sortof. somewhere, some computer decided to send 
THIS message straight to your &lt;virtual&gt; rusted metal mailbox. somewhere, 
deep inside, you &lt;yes YOU&gt; feel that hey! soemone cares! maybe...

and of course, you say &quot;all&quot; sites carry &quot;all&quot; &quot;rec&quot; groups.
sorry, been cut off from too much stuff before for that one. for example, 
those who only access the 'net from a BBS, who uses UUCP &lt;NO! they realy 
do that anymore! wow! how quaint..&gt; and selects what netnews they &lt;the 
system op's that is&gt;  wish to get. sure, some will even spend a bit more, 
&lt;you know...paying byte by byte..or is tht old fashioned to?&gt; and get 
that newgroup and all the traffic, and crossposting, and other bullsh!t, 
just from maybe ONE user!! or instead, they can just not have the control 
and let it go throught hte more controled, yet uncontrolled email channels.


or why dont you check out what is available on earth.armory_dot_com? see if 
you find &quot;all&quot;...


anway, sorry for the lenght..but..

btw, if i offendeed anyone &lt;and i hope i did!!&gt; please flame ME! NOT THE 
LIST.


and all opinions &lt;and facts&gt; are the sole property of David Raistrick, 
and all subsidarys.

oh, one more thing.
when you are in a hurry, you chek your email. woud you bother to check 
your &lt;your??&gt; usenet feed too? and, maybe you forget...

and of course, you say you have never experiance delays. check it out, 
maybe you'll learn that one message does NOT get to all those mythical 
places usenet is supposed to reach...


but i drift.


&lt;hmm...sorry, no VW content..ack!&gt;

&gt; &gt; There are newsgroups that make the traffic here look puny. Since usenet is

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Again, I am suggesting this as a way to keep us together. To me, it is
&gt; &gt; preferable to splitting the camps. In a split, we lose the ability to hit a
&gt; &gt; larger pool of knowledge, don't have as much impact on suppliers, and really
&gt; &gt; take away somewhat from why we're here.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The option is there. It will be a large change either way.

&gt; &gt; My hat tipped to Gerry once again. I couldn't have done it.

&gt; &gt; sniff sniff...barry
&gt; 
&gt; Ya but monitor rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled for a while.  There is no community feeling.  
&gt; Of course if we start a group and all of us switched to it then there would be a community 
&gt; feeling for a while but it would degrade with time.
&gt; 
&gt; Also look at all the CR*P that gets posted to this group (and all others).

&gt; This garbage has increased over the past few years and will only get worse.

&gt; No thanx
