Subject: Re: Tim's 93 Eurovan 

I really hope Tim just got a Lemon.  Is there a Lemon Law that might 
apply to his vehicle?  How many miles have you put on it so far?

I drove the Vanagon 150,000 miles without ever getting stranded.

For what the Eurovan cost, I expect that same.  :&gt;

&gt; I wasn't going to say anything, because I couldn't think of anything nice
&gt; to say today, because my EV GL REALLY tweaked my gain this evening!
&gt; 
&gt; It'd been running flawlessly for the past 8 months or so.  I'd ALMOST
&gt; forgotten about all the trouble I'd had last year, until...
&gt; 
&gt; Driving home this evening, it just died, with 3/4 of a tank of gas in it.
&gt; I was in rush hour traffic and it stalled.  Even in gear, it wouldn't fire
&gt; back up again, so I coasted into a wide spot along the freeway and waited
&gt; for a tow.  Lights and everything else work.  I can crank it and it'll
&gt; fire, but won't run.  Got it towed to the dealer I bought it at and left it
&gt; for the service idiots to mess up in the morning.  There was no clue that
&gt; anything was going to go wrong... except, and this is the ONLY thing amiss,
&gt; the clock was off a few hours when I got in it yesterday morning.  Then
&gt; last night it was off again!  I just reset it this morning and went to
&gt; work.  Note:  The stalling feels exactly like the problem I had last year,
&gt; which resulted in the dealer replacing the battery, the computer, the fuel
&gt; injection system and the exhaust system.  What's left??
&gt; 
&gt; On the transmission:  Look up my post from last Dec or Jan on the troubles
&gt; I've had with this car.  Transmission had to be dismantled twice and gears
&gt; and shifters replaced (manual), and I'm not convinced it was done right.
&gt; 
&gt; I tell ya, if the problem is the same as it was last year, I'm baggin' it!
&gt; I really like the layout of the EV, but I'd buy another of those silly
&gt; Jellybean vans, or maybe even one of those ridiculous Chrysler Depot Hacks
&gt; before I'd put up with worrying about this thing just dying on me on a
&gt; two-rut road in the middle of the Utah desert or someplace (the kind of
&gt; places I like to go).
&gt; 
&gt; I'll find out tomorrow...  I hope.  Maybe I'll be civil then.
