Hi,

	Today, I took the first sump back and bitched and whined..
I got my money back.

	I took my $$ to another VW flaps and bought another sump, but by
a different maker, this one Scat.

	This one looks better than the other one.  Its less grainy in 
appearance, the mating surfaces are cleaner, and the threads are a whole lot
better.  The aluminum is much finer consistency than the other one.

	It also installed a lot easier, since they put holes in it to get
the wrench thru.  It also came with allen bolts to install it with, so
there must have been some validity to my original idea...

	Cross your fingers...

Thom
