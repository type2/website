&gt; forged (stock is cast) 
&gt;stroker crank, and replacing the &quot;Beetle&quot; conn rods with forged rods. 

I can see that these may be stronger and more durable yielding perhaps 
longer
life and ability to withstand higher RPMs, but I fail to see how these could
improve power or torque.

well:  

This gets a little slippery.  First, the separation between &quot;Power&quot; and 
&quot;Torque&quot;.  Power is defined as work per unit time; A Watt (power) is a Joule 
per second (W=J/s), horsepower is related, but different system of units.  
Torque is twisting force, usually unit force times unit distance (ft-lbs, 
newton-meters, etc)

what &quot;power&quot; and &quot;torque&quot; do to a car is not quite within my range of firm 
knowledge; at least, I cannot explain it well.  But:  The wasserboxer puts 
out 90hp (this is power, and at the rate of something like .74hp per cubic 
inch, doesn't lack too badly in the &quot;Power&quot; department.  Just think:  
Pushing that great big flat plate of a front end through the air (not to 
mention the 5,000 lbs/2000kgs of mass) at 75mph probably takes a lot of 
power.

Accelerating that up to  75 mph, however, takes an expanse of highway that 
would traverse any one of the western states.  This is where the torque 
comes in:  More torque (twisting power, applied to the shafts/axles/wheels) 
would mean better acceleration and better ability to handle hills.

The &quot;stroker&quot; crankshaft attacks both of these ills (all else, like piston 
height being the same, i.e., stock) as follows:  since the &quot;stroker&quot; crank 
has a longer throw (TDC to BDC is a larger distance, bottom end follows a 
larger circle), the piston bottoms lower, and goes up higher then the stock 
crank.  This means more air fuel ingested per stroke, compressed to a higher 
pressure (higher compression ratio), more efficiency, more power (and more 
fuel consumed, by the way!). 

Torque, remember, is twisting force; remember the ole' cheater bar approach 
to those DEElightful gland nuts?  With a longer lever arm, more torque is 
delivered by the system.....since the new (stroker) bearings are further 
from the crank centerline, a longer lever arm is created....and violin, more 
torque.  and power.

There  are some simplifying assumptions in this description that might not 
carry over well tro the real world.  Higher compression means higher octane 
requirements, and may result in interference 'twixt piston and 
valve.....there are others, but the bottom line is that some things have to 
be considered, but they can be worked around......

More later, I GOTTA GO.  Write with questions.....
