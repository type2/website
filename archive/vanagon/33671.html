The handle on my '82' Vanagon's sliding door is getting awfully loose - as in
there is an terrible amount of &quot;slop&quot; relative to the axis about which you
twist the handle to unlatch the door.

Anyone out there every take the thing apart or find a way to take up this
slop?? (Buying a new latch mechanism doesn't count!!!)

Thanks
Harvey
