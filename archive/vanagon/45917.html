Subject: Re: 83' fuel consumption is UNREAL


&gt;         While returning from my long weekend bush adventure I noticed that
&gt; I was consuming fuel at a very increased rate. Granted I did have one more
&gt; passenger, my girlfreind, but she weighs about the same as the amount of
&gt; water we had consumed from the tank, so I know it wasnt that. I checked for
&gt; leaks underneath, thinking that I may have puntured a fuel line or some
&gt; damned thing, but it offered no greater insight. The hills were bad coming
&gt; home, but again, not a drastic enough change to account for the dimished
&gt; fuel. The trip home to Edmonton was about 300km, and I used almost 2 full
&gt; tanks. SOMETHING IS WRONG!
&gt;         I now turn to you for insight o' wise list members.
&gt; 
150km on a tank!!! The worst I've seen is still around 300!

You mentioned doing brake pads the day before you left - I'd start 
there. If they were sticking enough to cause that kind of fuel cons., 
though, I'd figure you'd  feel major brake fade, and the van would 
barely *move*....
