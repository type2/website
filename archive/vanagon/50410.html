&gt; &gt;Your coolant light will blink if you do not have the proper mix of
&gt; &gt;coolant and water.  It will also blink if your fluid level is low.

&gt; The sensor is simply a level sensor, not a magical glycol sniffer.

Actually, the sensor is two little wires sticking into the coolant.  It
measures level by allowing the coolant to short these two wires out.  The
wrong mixture (usually too much antifreeze) will not pass enough current,
and this will be seen as a low-level indication, blinking the LED.  So it
is a &quot;magical glycol sniffer&quot; in an odd sense.
