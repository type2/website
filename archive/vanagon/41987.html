Subject: Re: external oil cooler for 82 vanagon? Heating up????

I have an 82 vanagon and I am thinking of installing an exterval oil 
cooler. I have a VDO temp guage on the sump and the temps are running 
around 230-250. I know that is too hot. I have brought it in to get 
checked out and they say that everything is fine with the cooling system. 
So I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on why it is getting so 
hot and how much and should I get an external cooler to hopefully solve 
the overheating problem.
