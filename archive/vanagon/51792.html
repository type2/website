Subject: Ignorant glow plug question

Please excuse this question as it is easily answered by the manuals, but I do
not have any yet and am in the process of ordering several.
On a '82 diesel Westy, what does the pull out cold start lever actually do??  I
looked at the injection pump where the cable attaches and did not see any
electrical connections.  I used to think that this lever actuated the glow
plugs, but now I don't see how it could.  What does it do and are the glow
plugs controlled by a relay, independently??

Thanks for your patient help.
