Subject: Re: Mo' buses in da movies

-A 12v sticker?
-The rear view mirror?
-Radio w/backing plate or large block off plate?                   ______
-If an outside shot then it would be the shape of the bumper ends /______
 front and rear                                                   \______

**Rusty guesses the type/shape of rear view mirror between the split windows
or the bumpers**

&gt;........................................................................
&gt;Was watching the 'boob-toob' last night when an ad for the
&gt;new Winona Ryder movie came on.  Her boyfriend was driving
&gt;a 66 or 67 Microbus.
&gt;
&gt;BONUS ROUND:
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone guess how I was able to place the year of the 
&gt;bus in the 2 seconds it was on screen?
