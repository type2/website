&gt;Most of the stuff on the halfdan vanagon gopher was contributed by Joel
&gt;Walker, and remains either reprinted fact, or his opinion.  I'd be really
&gt;happy to put other opinions on the gopher, and, I suspect Joel would be
&gt;perfectly happy to have some other opinions inserted too.

you betcha! i'm beginning to get a little bit worried about being set up in
some sort of Muir-like status. and we all know what happened to him! (he
died!). :)

i really wish other folks would write up what they have done to their buses
... so i didn't feel like i was the ONLY one who 'personalized' their cars.
well ... ok, i know derek does it (but he goes a little overboard). ;)
