&gt; Just to breathe some propane into the debate, I swear I have seen some
&gt; later-than-82 Westy control panels with a single BLUE LED, which I assumed
&gt; was the refrigerator LED, as there were still the two &quot;stoplight&quot; LED trios
&gt; showing battery condition and water level.
&gt; 
&gt; The only Dometics with gauges instead of LED's that I have seen were in
&gt; pre-Vanagons.

In the category of &quot;boring cocktail trivia&quot;, I thought that blue LEDs were
very rare, sort of military only stuff. The &quot;blue&quot; LEDs I have stripped
from VW instruments have been white ones with a blue filter. Does anybody
know of the existance of true blue LEDs?, and anybody care to comment on
the effect of tv development if such things exist?
