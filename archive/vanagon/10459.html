Subject: Saw The 1995 VW/Winnebago Camper In Northern Virginia

For anyone interested, there's one of them 'thing's at the Springfield VW dealer.

For a fleeting moment, I was attracted and tempted to consider a new toy but ...

It looks like the Eurovan camper we saw in Canada the summer of 1993.

Don't like the idea that to get at the fridge, one MUST remove the 2-PAX seat.

Overall, considering the modifications to my Eurovan, the new one didn't have 
enough to hold my attention/temptation-level. $21,000 for the Eurovan PLUS $9,800 
for the 'Winnie' modifications was a definite turn-off.

	If I didn't have one, however, it would be a 'toy' I'd like to have. :)
