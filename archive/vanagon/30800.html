Subject: Re: door-lock problem

&gt;	Hi,
&gt;	So I've got one new, Brazilian, door-handle with lock
&gt;installed on the passenger side. When I lock it, from inside
&gt;or outside, it locks fine. However, I can't open it with
&gt;the key from the outside!
&gt;	If I open and close the inside lock-lever, it
&gt;makes a pop-ping sound and they the key works form outside.
&gt;
&gt;	Anyone recognize this symptom?
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;check the spring (short one...1/2inch) inside the locking mech.
 This slips off every once in a while and causes the problem
 you suggested.
