&gt; 
&gt; If you want *real* power, you need the 2.4 5 cylinder  diesel 
&gt; fitted to my Tranny. Gobs more power than that  weedy 1.9 :-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;manner.  I got to one of the traffic lights, behind a '88
&gt; &gt;Cavalier.  The lights changed to amber as the nice person in
&gt; 
&gt; Get it right, P.J. - An Opel Ascona. I used to drive one but 
&gt; fortunately not the one mentioned above.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(and if you want to rob my house while I'm away, note that 
&gt; &gt;I'm taking the hard-disk and hiding the Transporter.)
&gt; 
&gt; Ah, but the Tranny will be at *my* house over Christmas.  If 
&gt; anyone wants to cross my palm with silver, I'll tell  you where 
&gt; it's kept and put the key under the left front tyre!
&gt; 
&gt;     FOR SALE : '91 VW Transit 1.9 Diesel slightly used
&gt;                Complete with Bull Bar slightly abused
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; .. with any luck P.J. won't check the list before he
&gt;     leaves so I'll have plenty of time to make a quick     
&gt;     killing.
&gt; 
&gt;     Happy Christmas all.
