&gt;&gt;         Edmonton will be having its first Hemp Day Festival this year, and
&gt;&gt; they are going to be raffling off a VW van that will be all painted up with
&gt;&gt; hemp related graphics. Cool huh.
&gt;


Oooh I'd luv to try to get across the border into the good ole US with
that rig- they'd probably just start shooting... I get enough
hassel in a plain  bronze 85 as it is. It doesn't pay to advertise!
VW vans are major heat scores already, without pictures of pot leaves
all over them. It would be nice to take a look at though...
