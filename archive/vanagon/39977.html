Subject: '66 progress,parts,powder coating?



Hi all,

I received a large order of parts from Wolfsberg-West yesterday.  Most of
it is my 12-volt conversion stuff including starter, alternator setup,
bulbs, various relays, wiper moter armature, coil, etc. etc. but also
a clutch, some rubber seals, engine bits, etc.  Everything seems to
be of excellent quality.

I got the heat risers in my intake manifold fully cleaned out thanks to
a proceedure outlined to me by Bob Hoover, just have to spray it grey now.

Does anyone have any experience with having a set of engine tin powder
coated?  How much did it cost, how well did it last, etc?  I'm also
trying to decide how to coat my heat exchangers.  I had them hot-tanked
and they are really clean but certainly not things of beauty!  Can these
be powder coated too?  If not,any recommendations for a good hi-heat
paint?

I ordered a few more parts from RMMW including the 63-67 Transporter Bentley
Manual and thermostat parts.  I was planning to order a VW emblem for the
front of the vehicle but their price for that item has increased considerably
from about $24 to about $85 (!).  Anyone know any place to get a less
expensive VW emblem for a splitty type II?  (Arg, I just remembered that
I forgot to order one of those $10 rear window seals they have on sale.  Well,
they have a 1-800 number there after all....)

  Thats all for now, much more later!
