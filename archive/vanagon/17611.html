	i am writing to let you know that i am the proud 
	owner of a, as one person put it, a shoebox on wheels
	with inadequate horsepower, but i would not have it
	any other way.  i have been having so much fun owning 
	a vw. 

		anyway, i am writing to tell you my name is
		kevin petrini and i drive a 1974 campmobile

	i found the stats last friday interesting and wanted
	to be added.


		also, i am currently in worcester massuchusetts
		but home is connecticut, i will be traveling 
		this summer and will ultimately end up in 
		colorado.  maybe i'll see some of you on
		the road and we can swap vw stories.



			peace to all
