Subject: Re: A Freindly Wave


I tend to agree...the Vanagon owners who are most likely to wave are the
ones driving either beat up old Vanagons or those speedy old diesels.  (I
*will* own one.) As for those Eurovan drivers, they're so confused by
their engines being at the wrong end that they don't have time to wave. :)

&gt;         To change the subject a bit, Why don't Vanagon drivers wave?
&gt; Whenever I take the '72 camper on a trip, air cooled people wave (and I wave
&gt; too).  When I drive my '82 no one seems to wave, why?  I've tried waveing as
&gt; I go down I-5, people look at me like im a kook or something (please, don't
&gt; say the obvious).
&gt; 
&gt;         Well, if you see a beat up '82 w/ a lot of antennas in the Siskiyou
&gt; Mts. Wave
&gt; 
&gt;         Oh, a couple of reasons air cooled drivers wave 1.  Its anothee one,
&gt; and it's running too.  2.  Shared pains and sorrows.
&gt;         I have noticed Vanagon drivers will wave in the middle of nowhere
&gt; and on dirt roads.
