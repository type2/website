Subject: Importing cars, to Alabama.


hewy volks...

about the guy in AL, who saw new mexi-bugs  at a dealership..

now,,,,we all know that Alabama is not really part of the united 
states...at lesat, in its eyes..:)

(got lots of family that lives there, and lived there for many years 
myself...)


and, if i remember correctly, alabama doesnt even require liability 
insureance on cars. at least, not to get tags. (my grandparents have 
lived there for over 60 years, off an on, and i dont think any one in the 
famiily that still lives there has ever had any auto insurance....)

thois state has one of the greatest (for us old car owners anyhow) 
antique tag policy in the states, to my knowldge..

you pay a one time fee, of ~30 dollars (last i checked), and you get a 
nice little antique vehicle tag. and you never have to register again.
nice, eh? and, again on memory here, it has a rolling age of 20 years....
(that is, 20 years old is consiered antique..:)


and there are no checks, emmisions, or otherwise, that one hasto worry 
about either. you walk in, tell 'em a few things, and you get tags. even 
on new cars. (again! memory...may have changed, but i havavnt heard 
ggramma bitch about not being able to register her new 96 grad prix...)

so its likely that this dealer just told 'em it was a 97 beetle, and they 
gave him tags for it...

just ideas...

:)
