&gt;So, I am wondering how to paint this thing.  ...
&gt;2. Camouflage paint using flat desert colors (tan, various light orange, etc.)

this sounds good. but you must realize that if you walk off on a hike away
from the bus, you might never find it again. :)

&gt;4. White all over

this is probably the most practical, heat-wise, and visibility wise ...
unless it snows that winter. ;)

&gt;And so, I'm lookin' for other ideas.  Anybody painted their bus anything but

there was an article in one of the magazines about a guy up in SF, CA who
painted his bus in a beautiful (really, super fine job) mural of mountains
and trees and all. he left the top in its original white (from below the
windows).

in some of the books i've got, there is a round-the-world bus with roof racks
loaded with stuff: it's painted white with huge zebra stripes. :)  looks kinda
neat. also several other paint jobs of various checkered patterns and such.
visibility-wise, i think the zebra-stripe or the checkered (table-cloth)
pattern would really stand out. scotch plaid, anyone? :)

how about like a greyhound bus?  an airliner of your favorite travel company?
shamu the whale on the side?  a big desert tortoise on the side? native
southwestern indian symbols on the side (it is a desert camper)?

hmmmmmm. that's gonna be a really hard choice. such a large canvas. :)
