Subject: Re: Too much heat?....


&gt; For the question of how to adjust the heat on those BN-4's:
&gt; There is a small set screw on the side of a fuel regulator that sits on
&gt; top of the heater. Loosen the lock-nut and turn the screw *slightly* to
&gt; change the rate of fuel delivery. The more fuel, the hotter it runs.
&gt; Don't allow too much in, or you will get clouds of black smoke from it 
&gt; burning too rich. 

Adjusting your heater like this could lead to problems.  The fuel pressure
regulator should be set so that 20-21 cc's of fuel are injected every two 
minutes--then tighten the lock nut and forget about it.  (this only 
applys to BN 4's made between '62 and '72.   The fuel systems on 
other BN 4's are completely different)  Use the thermostat on the output 
side of the 
heater to adjust the heat.  In case your thermostat is missing, 
ask your friendly VW parts man for a 211 261 355--he should still be able 
to order it.

Thats my 2 cents

-Tom
