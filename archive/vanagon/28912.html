Subject: Re: Spray Foam Alternative?

&gt;ACCORDING TO TEST RESULTS, TEMP-COAT WHEN APPLIED TO A THICKNESS OF 15
&gt;MILS (15 thousands of an inch), PERFORMS AS WELL AS A 4&quot; THICKNESS OF
&gt;FOAM WITH AN R-20 RATING.
&gt;

Jezuuz, now this is the stuff to use!  R-20 in fibreglass pink requires 6 
inches depth.  And now. for the $1000 question.... what does it cost?   Tim
