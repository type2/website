Subject: '73 FREE PARTS DC THIS WEEKEND

Well I bought a '73 sight unseen and I will be parting it at Steve 
Dolan's parents in Springfield VA this weekend, god willing.

Anyway basically the engine and tranny are already spoken for for 
Steve as is the front glass,  nearly anything else (not much I 
admit) is available.  The front axle is the only other thing of 
possible value, it is free to someone who needs it and shows up for 
it but I have no idea of it's condition.  Hell the whole Bus may be 
just jim dandy shape but I'm pulling it to parts regardless (famous 
last words).  Anyone who wants any rear glass or body panel with the 
exception of the sliding door is welcome to take em.  I intend to 
part on Saturday afternoon and Sunday, drop me email and I'll give 
directions.  Interior is of course available as are dash, lights, 
trim, etc.  Also features a set of only barely used Baby Dellorto 
carbs on T4 manifolds (34mm FRD's maybe?), these will however be for 
sale to the best offer, I have no idea what they go for now days, 
better than $250 I expect, as I said offers.  I will get Steve to 
post a better description of what's available on Saturday after we 
see it.

Anyway, Steve, Sean, and I will be there, anyone else is welcome for 
the sheer learning experience of ripping a Bus to shreds if nothing 
else.

On a PS, does anyone know if the '73 has the later sliding door, as I 
need it for the '78 but am not sure exactly when all the body changes 
were completed, when the lock changed, etc.
