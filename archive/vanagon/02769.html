Subject: Re: Antenna Replacement



&gt;
&gt;One of the few flaws on my lovely new (87) Syncro is a snapped off radio
&gt;antenna. I've purchased a replacement but - much to my chagrin- I don't
&gt;seem to find any reference to replacing said item in the Bentley manual.
&gt;
&gt;Attempting to wing it has proven rather daunting, and I stopped before I
&gt;made a big mess of things. Please, somebody tell me that I don't have to
&gt;remove the entire dash assembly to do this.

	Its funny, but the big fat Bently (80-89?) doesn't
	show the antenna replacement, but the skinnier (80-83)
	Bently does.

	You get at the bugger from the front grill. It sort
	of goes down then out and up. Its tight, and there
	are some sharpish edges.

	Don't forget to disconnect the antenna lead from the
	radio, you do have to take the instrument cluster
	out (and removing the ashtray helps too), to thread
	the new lead into the dash and connect with the radio.
