Subject: a couple new photos on the web


Hi all,

I finally got my pictures back from our Christmas tree cutting expedition
to the Chirachaua mountains and scanned a couple in.  There is a link
from my home page (see signature) to the new &quot;Prospector&quot; page.  (There is
also a cute picture of our beagle in there too.)

Sure hope I can make it to the Red Rocks gathering, I think I could win the
&quot;ugly bus contest&quot;!  Unfortunately, our landlords told us yesterday that
they want to move back into their house April 1 ( :-( )  That means we have to
scramble to get a new house and may well be moving that weekend.  (but, we'll
see...)

Cheers,

 -Dyer
