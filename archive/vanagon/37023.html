Subject: Westy plaid fabric for late bay windows

OK, following the lead a few months back on the list (thanks whoever, I
cant recall) I talked with the Trim Shop (now called something
different,
of Thing parts fame.  They do indeed have 2 rolls of OEM plaid Westy
fabric,
sent me a swatch.  it is the primarily yellow, green, and black with
smaller
orange stripe pattern used primarily in bright yellow on yellow '75+
Westys.
May also be in bright orange Westy's I don't recall must look at a
friends '75.
Well to boil down I want enough for the parents mint '77 as the front
seats
are slightly faded and I want to put enough away in the eventuality of
a total
recover (I figure 10-15 yards for an entire bus, front seats, rear
seats and bed,
top bunks)  material is 54&quot; wide.  Now thing is this, owner is sort of
a jerk IMHO
but his wife is very pleasant, they used to be in the VW upholstery
business hence the fabric.  He belabored how he could sell this stuff
at any SOTO meet
for $30/yd (and maybe he could).  The smaller roll he has is about 30
yd's and
he will sell for $13/yd or $10/yd if I take the whole roll, which is
more than I need.  Hence if anyone wants to go in for half the roll
please get back to me pretty soon and I'll set it up.
