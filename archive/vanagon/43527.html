Last year's Rolling Concours at Pacific Grove included Carol Shelby at the
head of a pack of 25 Vipers, multiple Lamborghinis, Beetles, Karman
Ghias, a couple on matching Vespa scooters and a '41 Ford Woodie. As
we drove from Pacific Grove to Carmel and then to Monterey, people lined
the sides of the street and waved, took pictures and video-taped the
parade. It wasn't cheap, but it was a blast. We waved, wrist-wrist, elbow-
elbow, and people on top of bridges shouted &quot;Farfegnugen!&quot; I think
it would be nice if such events included more than the pointy and red...

	Cheers!
