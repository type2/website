&quot;NOW THE NEAT ONE, I WISH YOU COULD SEE THE PICTURE OF THIS THING.

'82 VW LT45TD, 4wd camper, 6 cyl Vovlo turbo diesel,
low miles, many spares, $30,000

Anybody know about this?  Looks like Vanagons big
brother, with a raised fiberglass roof, lenthened rear
end, but what might be standard vanagon nose (hard to
say comparing teeny picture to the '81)  certainly seems
to have Vanagon grill, lights, and VW emblem.  $30k
a lot but looks as big as the EV based big Winnie,
and this has got 4wd

Oh well in UT (801)645-7666 days (801)649-9719 eve&quot;

  Really interesting.  About a month ago I proposed a friend's suggestion 
that I cut the end of my Vanagon Westie from the front.  Then, he'd 
attach a section from a salvage yard donor that included the body from 
a little forward of the rear window measured so that the extra rear 
window on each side would appear spaced very like what a factory version 
of a longer Vanagon might have appeared.  I've seen photos of his long 
sold extra long Dodge Maxivan done this way, and it appears like an 
unusually long factory model.  So does this already exist in the Vanagon 
family of customizations?  Reread the description above.  Stock Vanagon 
rear overhang is so short that this addition still wouldn't make it 
conspicuously customized.  Has anyone seen this done to a Vanagon based 
vehicle?  The US manufactured vans tricked out this way aren't that 
unusual, but I'd surely like to talk to someone who's lived with a well 
done extended Vanagon.  If you sight one, please get a plate number if 
you can and post your sighting to the list.

  Thankz,
  John Wakefield
