Well I made it to the referee and it passed.  It seem the original tester 
I took my '72 to had a 1994 smog manual and that the 1995 manual had been 
corrected.  I am glad because he said had it not I would have had to get 
a letter from the factory ( not a dealer )  That stated '72 year model 
did not have smog pumps or EGR valves.

So the Westy is now street legal :-) and I can start checking it out on 
short trips.  

Thanks all for the suggestions
