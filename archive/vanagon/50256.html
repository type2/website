Subject: re &quot;House Tags,&quot; &quot;Motor Homes,&quot; and Insurance

I don't know about special tags in Washington state, but I found that State
Farm *did* recognize the EV Camper as a &quot;recreational vehicle&quot;, and this
combined with it not being my only car, significantly reduced the insurance
rate. It is *not* my primary transport vehicle which probably helped a lot.
I asked them why they didn't discount my Vanagon Camper when I first
insured it, and they hemmed and hawed a bit and never really did answer the
question.
The EV Camper does have a Washington State &quot;inspection plate&quot; on it which
certifies that it meets various state standards. Also an RVAA plate stating
the same. These may also be a factor - as far as the state is concerned
apparently it *is* a motor home. (Geez if I put a toilet in it I could get
a tax deduction no?)
