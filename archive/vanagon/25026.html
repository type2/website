&gt;as to the overheating on long idles, I believe the problem with my '85 is
&gt;that the cooling fan situated over the spare tire is inoperative.

&gt;I have yet figured out how to fix it though.

Some fans will run with the ignition switched off.  Other vehicle
manufacturers wire the fan to be able to run whether or not the ignition is on
or off.  Check the fan blades to see that they aren't jammed.  You can test
the fan itself by disconnecting it from the wiring harness and applying 12
volts directly.

The electric cooling fan is usually powered through two temperature controlled
switches, a &quot;slow&quot; speed and a &quot;high&quot; speed.  The slow speed puts a dropping
resistor in series with the fan ( mybe around 0.5 Ohms???).   The resistor is
physically large, about 1/2&quot; square and a couple of inches long, and the
outside surface is a rough ceramic material.   The high speed switch is direct
full battery voltage.  In some cases the resistor fails (typically &quot;open&quot;). 
Otherwise it is usually the switch. 

These switches are usually screwed into the side tank of the radiator and have
2 leads each.  The fan should come on if you short the two terminals of the
switch together.  They are typically about 5/8&quot; in diameter with flats for a
wrench , and have flat 1/4&quot; male spade terminals on the top.
