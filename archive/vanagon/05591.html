Responding to Pet Sellers' comments about roughing it across NA:

Basically I save that kind of attitude for travelling in Asia or SE Asia,
where the people are genuine, friendly and curious --Got an hour I'll tell
you about our &quot;bus&quot; trip from France to India and back -sometime. 


My goal? By bus to Chile and back in six months. It CAN be done and what
better vehicle to do it in?
