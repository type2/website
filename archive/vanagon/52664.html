&gt;Good thermostats:
&gt;	Behr Thompson
&gt;	Wahler
&gt;
&gt;Not good in my experience:
&gt;	Motor craft
&gt;	Stant (or stent or something like that)

One very important feature to remember when using aftermarket thermostats is
the bypass flange. The VW and other good thermostats have a sencond flange
of the pump side of the thermostat. As the engine heats up it closes off the
bypass, which was open to allow for quicker warmup. Really wierd cooling
problems can arise from one of those generic thermostats.
