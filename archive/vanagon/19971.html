Subject: Ford list address request


Please, do not flame me.

I do own lots of vans (VW of course) but I also own a couple of Fords; 
and I need the address of a FORD LIST and listserver.  I need the 
complete name of the list and the complete name of the listserver to send 
the &lt;subscribe&gt; &lt;Ford-list-name&gt; command to .

I am really a cool guy, I do all the work on my vehicles (except for 
foundry and machine shop stuff)  I also have answered help requests on 
this VW Van list.  

Really it is okay to own a Ford.  (just nobody throws you peace signs)
