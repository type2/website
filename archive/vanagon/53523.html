Subject: 97 Westy Weekender???  T or F ?

I saw a posting on the list the other day of someone having a
conversation with a dealer about Westfalia bringing in a 97 Weekender. 
I was reading my messages from my sister's house and wasn't able to save
the message.  So whoever that was, do you have any more details?  Anyone
else heard of this?  Any more details?
