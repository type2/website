Well, not one to want to remain unknown.... :)   'Cept I do not own a bus.  I
_almost_ bought one, a beautiful psychadellic painted micro in Los Gatos, CA.
Unfortunately, I was in progress of closing the deal on my new '75 Super Beetle
convertable at the time.  
  I have been reading this list for its engine content, since my new bug shares
similiar engine characteristics of the busses from the same era.
  Now my new friend in its beatiful blinding banana yellow glory must visit the
Beetle Mania (yes, that's the name!) fixit shop to have a large majority of its pan
replaced.  Zero rust on the body, but the pan.... UGGGG!!!!  I neglected to check
this tiny detail in the dealer's lot due to very heavy rain in the Bay Area at the
time.  
  Car runs like a champ, good heat (in fact, heat all the time... the cables need to
be rebuilt), not a ding or scrape on the body.   Gotta get the pan rebuilt though,
else I'll end up with my butt sliding down 101 one day on the way to work.  :)  Damn!
I knew that I should have taken &quot;Welding-101&quot; in school long ago!
  Already enquired, and the shop can do the work.... I just &quot;might&quot; enquire about a
small loan from the bank to pay for it though!  :)
  This is my very first VW experience, and all problems aside, I'm loving every
minute!  This has been the most fun I've had driving in years!



Peace.
-Joe
