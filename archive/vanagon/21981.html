Lisa: is this a rebuilt? If so give at least 1000 miles before the full
power of the engine can be realised (which isn't much to begin with). If the
rebuilders knew what they were
doing the rings etc will need to seat with time - don't stress the engine too
much in the first few months give it time.
AT does not help matters though....have been told by all VW mechanics to
avoid AT if possible. The only thing I can imagine that would be slower is
a diesel with AT...
