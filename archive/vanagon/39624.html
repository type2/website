Well I have to saw that one time I adjustedmy valves and did a compession 
check thereafter.  I freaked when one cylinder showed nothing.  I had 
accidentally cocked the swivel foot sideways and it was holding the valve 
open.  Good thing I didn't start it right away.  I would say this was a 
case of out of adjustment valves, however, it was me that caused the 
problem and not the normal wear and tear of the engine itself.
