&gt; meanwhile my van sits in the backyard with a newly done wax job just waiting
&gt; to be driven. have a feeling i won't be going anywhere next weekend either.
&gt; 
&gt; anyone in the raleigh, nc area have a sparte axle assembly for a '74 bus,
&gt; standard drive? this is all i'm missing to be on the road. i'm so pissed at
&gt; this whole situation...makes me wonder why i bought a vw. :-( have had the van
&gt; for almost 4 weeks now and driven it only once around the block.
