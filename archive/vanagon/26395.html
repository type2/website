&gt;HI all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This morning I spotted what looked like a 76 VW bus (saw it from a
&gt;&gt;distance)that was a converted camper (looked like a vertical pop top).  What
&gt;&gt;was unusual was that it was about 5 feet longer than a normal bus.  Looks
&gt;&gt;like this fellow welded the middle section of another bus to the front and
&gt;&gt;back ends of his bus.  His plate was of U.S. origin, I couldn't make out
&gt;&gt;what state.  I've never seen one of these in Canada or anywhere else!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Too bad that you didn't get a photo for the weirdest of the weird page in
&gt;one of the magazines! Was the body over hanging the wheel wells by 5' on
&gt;both ends? What was the total length?

&gt;

Nope. The front and back ends were as usual but the middle was 4-5 feet
longer(picture a stretch limo) . I'd say the total length was 17-18 feet.
