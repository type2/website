&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone had similar symptoms with a faulty sensor or is there something I
&gt; &gt; am overlooking?

&gt; I had problems with the sensor in my '78 several years back. The 
&gt; engine would be running ok for a while and then would not idle at a 
&gt; constant rpm at all. I put my multimeter on the lead from the sensor 
&gt; when it was doing this, and the voltage was jumping all over, 
&gt; indicating that the sensor was intermittent. Replacing the sensor 
&gt; fixed the problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; My sensor was in a hole in the tin so I could get a deep socket on 
&gt; it. Unfortunately, when I removed the old one, it took some of the 
&gt; aluminum threads with it. I had to clean up the threads with a tap 
&gt; and put the new sensor in gently with some loctite. Worked good.

	I've been trying to figure out why my '77 won't idle below 2000 rpm
for a while now.  Could this be the culprit?

thanx,
