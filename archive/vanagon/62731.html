I'm tending towards not archiving these recordings.  The problem is that
the MPEG3 audio files aren't at all VW-related... they're just recordings
of pop songs.

What I *would* like to do is archive MPEG3's containing members of the
Vanagon crowd singing the parodies themselves.  We have several excellent
musicians in the group (Martha, Kathy, etc.) and I'm sure there are folks
willing to sing.

I think that this would be a lot more fun (and interesting) than a
recording of 'Puff the Magic Dragon'.
