Hey now

Sick of having to recharge my old no-name battery everytime I
wanted to go out in Samiam, my green '77 Westy, I auled myself
to Sears for one of those fine Die-Hards.

In the catalog and the computer, it turns out that my '77 VW
Transporter is really a &quot;Vanagon!&quot;

Which list (VANAGON, type2) should I participate in?  I wonder
if I get a free radiator from Sears! :-)
