Subject: Anyone Install a Drain Plug on a Vanagon Auto-Tranny

I am considering putting a drain plug on the auto-trans of my 87GL. I
propose drilling the boss on the opposite side from the ATF filler tube
and tapping it for a drain plug. Has anyone done this? The boss on the
ATF pan looks it was designed for a drain plug on some other
application. I wish to know if there is enough metal there to accept the
threads necessary for a drain plug. Anyone done this? Anyone have a any
data on the thickness of the boss on the ATF pan? Any data and feedback
appreciated.
