Subject: window screens

On an 84 Camper I had I just use the frames and bought some vinyl screening
and repaired the the holes in the screen that way.  You also have to have
the rubber tubing inserts that fit in the frame groove but if you don't have
that you can probably get that from where you get the screening.
 
On another note I just looked at a 91 Vanagon with the weekender pkg
including screens and curtains.  It's in pretty decent condition with 39+K
mi. on it.  They were asking $12,988 for it at the dealer.  I just missed
out on a 91 GL that had 29+K in even better condition for $11,300 at another
dealer. The person who had 1st dibs took it.  What do you think of the price
on the 91 weekender?...Joe
