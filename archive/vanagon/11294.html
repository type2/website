Subject: TINTING COMPLETED



 &gt; From: Scott Harvey &lt;CNETSAH_at_mvs.oac.ucla_dot_edu&gt;
 The place I went will remove
 &gt; the tint for free if I'm stopped and issued a 'fix-it' ticket.  And
 &gt; further, they'll reinstall it for $25 once the fix-it ticket is taken
 &gt; care of.  Only in America!

Scott, where is this place? - I also live in LA
