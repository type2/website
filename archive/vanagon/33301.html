Funny we should be exploring the idiot factor, because I *just now* recovered
(I hope!) from a reeely good example...  having tuned the Pumpkin last week,
I've driven about 50 miles since then.  On way home last night, I heard a
mildly disquieting &quot;ticking&quot; of the engine - &quot;not valves, nooo, what IS that?
 Will have to look in the AM..&quot;  This morning, I started up the bus to run
down to my storage space and...  a LOUD thunking about was going on back
there!  Alarm bells ringing, I shut her down and ran back to peep into the
engine compartment, and lo, there, in *shreds*, lay the (plasteek) &quot;debris
strainer&quot;, which I had forgotten to put back in place after tuning up.  It
was flapping around in there, and tore up the edge of the fan belt pretty
badly..  so off I go to the FLAPS for a new belt...    color me mortified!  I
think this one qualifies me on all three counts - Arrggghhhh!
