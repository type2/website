Mark Keller was talking about load measuring for the starter.  For the 
record, I get this done at a local battery shop, in my case Battery 
Warehouse.  They will load test the battery, and measure starter draw, for 
free.  And since all they do is sell batteries, they don't WANT to fix anything.
HTH,
