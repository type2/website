Subject: RE: Wavering Wannabus

I have an 85 Wasserboxer (Wesfalia) and love it.  I paid $3500 for it knowing
it would need an engine rebuild.  Rebuilt the engine myself for about $600.
 It requires more maintenance than my other cars but I don't think I would
drive a car I couldn't tinker with.  Once the engine was rebuilt (and I keep
up with a religious maintenance schedule in ALL my cars) I hardly ever have
to make repairs.  Guess I'm going to have to get another VW so I can tinker.
