Jim,

Sounds very similar to an elusive problem I had on my '82 Scirocco - 
finally replaced injector O-rings &amp; it's ran great ever since. 

The injectors are tough to get out - just pull straight out - I clamp 
gently with vise-grips then pry out slowly with a screwdriver. Check 
the spray pattern of each, and the operation of the 5th injector (ala 
Bentley) while your at it. If they're spraying poorly, Lubro-Moly 
stuff should help...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
