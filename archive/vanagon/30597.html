Subject: Re: Clutchless in California

(snip)

Got a phone call from dealer's shop about the van just now.  Aside from no
power at the shop due to the storm, they believe that something in the clutch
broke, and have to drop the tranny to &quot;look and see&quot;.  Current estimate is
$360 to Remove and Replace, possibly another  $290 parts for clutch and stuff.
(end snip)

Seems a bit high on the labor there. If they are charging $60/HR, that is six 
hours labor!!!!! I would be willing to accept three hours for the work to be 
done. That gives the mechanic 1 hour to drop the tranny, 1 hour to replace 
either the broken cross shaft or pressure plate (typical problems on the 
Vanagon) and 1 hour to put it all together and test it. This is not a major 
repair! You may want to ask what the time is, and ask if they are quoting &quot;flat 
rate&quot;. I could do the job three hours easy in a driveway! The shop should take 
even less!

Parts price sounds normal VW dealer price...just the disc lists for $200 from 
the dealer...they are prolly assuming to replace the pressure plate and not the 
disc.

YMMV, of course....Good luck!
