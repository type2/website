Has anyone ever tried to design a condenser air chimney that extends
into the outside panel space, passing up between the kitchen windows,
exiting through a rain cap at a sufficiently high point to induce
natural draft just like other compact RV vehicles?  Obviously it should
be insulated if only to retain as much density shift as possible through
out the whole column since that's what makes chimneys auto-vent. 
Probably the external fan could become almost redundant.

It seems to me that VW sold vehicles with motor radiator fans that came
on too late and refrigerator fans that came on too early.  We owners are
left with the task of correcting their kit's design.
