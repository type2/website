Subject: Re: camper fit in garage?

The manual sez the 76 westy is 6' 8&quot; in height, and mine is pretty darn 
close to that.  I can juuuust fit mine into my underground garage... with 
about 1/16th of an inch clearance.  (Love to freak out my landlord by 
barrelling into the garage full tilt and watch his face as the daylight 
disappears above my camper!)

If it's close, and if you aren't going to be driving it in and out all 
the time (like, if it's a weekend camper), why not let just enough air 
out of the tires to get it in?  Seriously.  I've found I can get it 
lowered by 2&quot; easy that way, and if you have a portable electric 
compressor, it only takes 5 min or so to get the pressure back up to specs.

Of course, you could always lower your van, put on small rims, and 
low-profile tires!  You could fit it in the garage AND have that way-cool 
bitchen sano Cal-look!

OUCH!  JUST KIDDING!  FLAME-THROWERS OFF, PLEASE!

P.S.  MIG-surgery on the exhaust was successful: $45.00!  Thanks to all 
who responded with suggestions and support.  I may contact some of the 
places suggested by you folks this winter when I have the time, money, 
and an engine out of the bus.
