About two months ago I put out a message encouraging suggestions about
my huge roadtrip... well.. I left for it on June 1st, and now it's 
July something and I still haven't returned.  which as it turns out, 
is both good and bad.
We left from Omaha, Nebraska, and after 3500 miles and dipping up into
British Columbia (and visiting Allistair! and others from other lists 
along the way) that put us in Crescent City, California, on the very 
top of CA on the shore.  About 10 miles south of there, the van gave 
out... turned out it was a sheared cam shaft gear.  Ken Percy who 
operates the Beetle Barn there in Crescent City worked on it.. it took
two weeks to get a reground cam shaft (meanwhile we hitched a ride 
from a fellow bus owner down the coast to the bay area for the two 
week wait and then hitched and greyhounded back up when it was done so
we wouldn't have to sit around in CC for the two weeks).  He rebuilt 
the engine in addition to replacing the cam shaft.. new 
pistons/cylinders, etc.  
After we picked up the van, we drove around CC for about 35 miles.. to
get the rings worked in, and after awhile we hit the highway again.  
It ran great.. very smooth, and everything was great.  We cut over to 
I-5 down to stockton and cut over through yosemite and death valley 
(we didn't go through the hot parts during the day... although it's 
still pretty hot in death valley in the middle of the night)
about 75 miles from Las Vegas, the van died again.
I went through the muir manual once again and I noticed that the fuel 
pump wasn't putting out anything.  (The guy had installed a manual 
fuel pump.. before I had the electric...but it was still on there).  
So I switched it over to the electric fuel pump, and it still wouldn't
start, and the plugs were still dry.  Turns out it was once again a 
broken cam shaft.. the valves weren't moving when the engine turned 
over.
As we were waiting, Jimmy.. the guy with the '70 blue hitop bus.. the 
SAME guy who picked us up when we were hitchiking down the coast.. 
drives by and stopped.  After we discussed the unbelievable odds of 
this happening, he gave us a ride on in to LV and thank god for the 
AAA plus plan, had it towed in for free.   Now it's at the Beetle Barn
(another strange coincidence) here in LV having the cam shaft 
replaced.  It's going to cost me $1000.
 
Oh, and the first time it cost me $1235 for the complete rebuild... 
$500 labor and $600 and something parts.. the rest tax.
Now  I'm wondering what I should do. 
I'm wondering what YOU would do if the same thing happened to you... I 
don't feel that I should be stuck with the entire bill two times in 
700 miles... but then again the first guy did put a lot of new parts 
into it.  I called Ken (the guy at the first beetle barn) and asked 
him for a partial refund.  He told me to find out exactly what went 
wrong with the cam shaft, and then we'd go from there.  I can't 
remember exactly what he said, but basically if something specific 
went wrong with the cam shaft (which I can't remember right now) he 
says he won't stand by it. 
I don't know where I stand legally... not that I'm looking forward to 
taking any legal measures...
but any suggestions are appreciated.

p.s.  some of you are on our trip mailing list...basically an update 
(well.. sorta) of what's going on on our trip... we gave up after day 
9 because of lack of computer access on the remainder of the trip.. 
but we will update it after we return home.  so if you're interested, 
send me a message.

luckily I found my way to UNLV and used the showers in the University 
gym... Ed greyhounded back home...I think this broken down business 
took the toll on him for too long.... I'm able to sleep in my van at 
night.. I asked them to park it outside after they close so I can &quot;get
to my stuff&quot; and I'm able to watch all of the cheesy lounge acts at 
the casinos in the evenings.  i promised my self I wouldn't stay in a 
hotel the entire trip.  What an interesting place to be stranded.
