Subject: air in my hydraulic lifters?

About a month ago my '82 camper developed noisy valves when first
started. Although it would go away pretty quick it certainly got my attention.
It has 8,000 miles on a rebuild done about a 10 months ago..yes it's
still under warantee. I took it back to the shop that did
the rebuild and subsequent tuneup and oil changes. They said there was
air in the hydraulic lifters and had squirted something into the
valves to prevent it from happening again. Is this a common thing, a
sign of future problems, both, or should I just relax and not worry?
Thanks, I appreciate any thoughts/ideas
