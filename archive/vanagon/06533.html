	I'm going, and if I haven't found my pick-up yet, I'll be
in my Corrado (Easy- no hook-ups!)
	I'd be happy to double with someone. Drop me a line.
	If I don't hear from anyone today, I'll make a solo reservation
tomorrow.
	I might bring a friend and/or child depending on who's feeling 
adventurous at that time of year. I'll certainly bring a guitar and
firewood.

	Bill
