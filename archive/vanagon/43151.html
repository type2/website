Subject: &quot;special gastank&quot; part number???


 anyway....
 no that we have this going...
 i remember that my friend, who happens to be from austria,
 resently brought an interesting piece of VW micro fiche,
 which is labeled VW type II, but it is for 86-92 transporters and
 vanagons ( it's in german, but i can stumble through it..)
 i really have not had a chance to really look at it, but
 it did show all kinds of stuff that i've never seen before...
 like, carbureted wasserboxer motors, late FI systems Without lamba or
 cat,  stuff to make your van an ambulance or fire engine,
all kinds of bizarre stuff....and way i look at it tonight and see
if it has any unusual gas tnaks and repart tomorrow...
later
patrick...
