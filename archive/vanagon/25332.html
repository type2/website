&gt; remember, when the PC 600 is putting out 5 amps, then (110*5 =
&gt; 550Watts) it is drawing MORE THAN 45 amps from the
&gt; alternator/battery.

That's why I had to install a couple of 4 gauge wires running from it to
the battery.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Scares me to think that the PC 1500, at full blast, could draw more
&gt; than (1500/12 = 125) 125 amps from the alternator/battery combo.  

That scared me too :)  I don't think I would run it while the engine is
going, just in case those stories of overloading the alternator are
true!  Actually, I don't think 125 amps for a couple of minutes is any
big deal.  Starters draw more than that (well, maybe not VW starters).
