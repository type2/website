Subject: California Vanagon warning?

After having my Westie checked out I discovered the gas tank seals and hoses
are leaking. The mechanic said that he has seen and increase in this since
California
has switched to new reformulated gasoline. (The additives in the gas have a
knack for eating certian plastics and rubber.)

So, for those of you who live in California, you might want to keep an eye on
this.
