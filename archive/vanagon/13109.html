&gt; My van has 86,000 on the clock and has 16,000 since the valve drop/rebuild-
&gt; over-christmas-break-gawdawful-expensive episode in 1991.  I would be
&gt; willing to bet that those are original miles, too.  73 campers don't seem
&gt; to run for very long at a time.

Should have gone a lot longer than that, remember the early type
IV's like the type I's don't have hydraulic lifters, adjust them
valves every 3000, or at least 5000 and no problems as long as your
not running full tilt all the time, of course that Safare conversion
does probably weigh a ton.
