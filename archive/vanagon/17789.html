I will second this, with a little more detail; ours has all options EXCEPT
the Weekender poptop, and the automatic tranny.

Money being a relative thing, I figure the true cost of this vehicle is
really
not that bad.  Another way to look at it is this:  He who dies most massively
in debt has come out ahead in the end.   ;-)  

Oh yeah, just be sure you don't have any heirs...

Seriously, though, I think the EV is a pretty slick automotive creation very
much in the mold of the T1s, 2s, and 3s before it (you just have to know 
where to look)
