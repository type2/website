Subject: Prices:'83 throttle cable (!?)

Last week I thought that I better quit pushing my luck and add a throttle
cable to the &quot;Emergency Kit&quot; for the '83 Westy. Prices ranged as much as
$46.48!!!!
FOR A THROTTLE CABLE! =)

All prices local to the Phoenix, Arizona Metro area:
All prices are for 251-721-555C (all German not Italian, Mexican or
Brazilian...)

Berge Mazda Volkswagen, Mesa,AZ $52.43

Chapman Autoplex (Mazda, VW, Volvo, BMW, Whatever we can get our hands on...)
Scottsdale, AZ $48.55

FLAPS #1 (BAP) Mesa, AZ &quot;Don't stock it, Dude. Like what's that # agin? Heh-heh&quot;

FLAPS #2 (BAP) Scottsdale,AZ $6.95 &quot;Like, can you drive in 15 miles, pay for
it and like, wait two hours until it's delivered?&quot; &lt;Rusty: Like, whatever
happened to the concept of SERVICE, *Dude*!!&gt;

FLAPS #3 (Toy' Discount Auto Supply) Mesa, AZ Quoted price on phone, $7.95,
plenty in stock. Actual sale price after hearing price comparison etc, $5.95.
I ended up buying cap, rotor, airfilter, alt belt, points, condensor. Mr.Toy
is always extremely nice, an ex factory trained mechanic from the &quot;old days&quot;
and knows the meaning of acting as a professional and providing service to
his customers.

Called the dealerships and verified the part numbers and the prices and the
&quot;service&quot; man on the other line said &quot;If they're that cheap buy ten of them.&quot;
Thanks, I will... 

BTW: In a related thread, does anyone know how to say &quot;Bite me&quot; in German. ;)
