Subject: Re: what are sealing rings?

Mine is an air-cooled. They don't show up in the Bentley for AC engines at
all, but are called 'sealing rings' in the Haynes manual.
In contrast, they do show up in the Bentley manual for the water-cooled
engines. In essence, they are the head gaskets.
(my engine just leaked air, not water!)

&gt;I see that you had &quot;real head gaskets (aka sealing rings)&quot;
&gt;installed. Is this a wasserboxer? What are &quot;sealing rings&quot;?
&gt;Do these replace the head gasket? My '86 has the drip, not
&gt;too bad yet, but I'll have to deal with this problem sometime
&gt;in the not too distant future :(
