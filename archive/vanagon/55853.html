&gt; filter with a nut on the end. Again, if a diesel filter, or some 
&gt; other type would work, it is possible to get a wrench to fit the end 
&gt; of the filter. EC just did an article suggesting that the larger 
&gt; diesel filter is a good upgrade for gas engines, so if it would fit 
&gt; the EV, can't see how it could hurt. And it's about half the price, 
&gt; even from the dealer.

There's been some big commotion on rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled about
this EC article.  Apparently the diesel filter is more restrictive than
the gas filter and some people have ruined their engines trying this.
I've heard that litigation is involved against EC.  Now, take what you
read on newsgroups with a grain of salt, but if the diesel and gas
filters were the same, why would VW make two different ones?

I wouldn't try it.
