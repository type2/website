Subject: Re: oil pressure at idle

&gt;
&gt;One of you wrote that your oil pressure reading at idle is 0,
&gt;and another wrote that the oil pressure reads at 15-20 psi.
&gt;
&gt;Any explainations for this much of a difference?  Could it be
&gt;the particular gauge or sending unit?

Yes, I was the one with 0 psi at idle. It should just be the gauge/sending
unit which has a problem, not the engine. I say that because the idiot
light (which is still connected to the stock sender) does *not* go on.
Hence I should have at least 7 psi at idle.

Could it be that the gauges are off because of the *long* wires from the
engine to the dash board?
