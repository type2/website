Subject: vw dealers refuse (conspiracy)


	Sorry to hear that some VW dealers have come up with a ten 
year cutoff policy for service.

	The dealers in my area (south San Francisco Bay Area) have no 
such restrictions that I'm aware of. Friends with older VW's have 
reported no problems, anyway. In fact I know of at least two dealers which 
still have the &quot;Vintage Club&quot; at their service departments- owners of 
older cars (10+ years, I think) get a break on parts and maybe 
service.

	When I get a chance I'll call the VW customer relations 800 
number and find out what, if anything, VWoA has to *say* about this.

	Let's hope it's just some dealers being buttheads....
