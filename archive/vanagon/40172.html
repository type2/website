that's even worse, if the tv news is to be believed ... just this evening, they
said that diesel fuel had risen in price by 40 percent (yup, that's FORTY)
since March. and the truckers and shippers were pretty ticked about it, cause
for some reason, they were having trouble passing the extra cost on to their
customers. maybe pre-existing contracts or something?
anyway, they are NOT happy about the gas companies!

actually, it really doesn't matter much to any of us ... we cut down on our
driving a little bit; don't hotrod as much. but in the end, we pay whatever
it takes to keep driving. just like in Europe. even if it cost $2.00/liter,
most of the folks would cut back on expenses elsewhere. same thing over here.
Sad, but True.   but it does put a real dent in the cost of going to Inuvik
for that Motley Crew planning to do so.
