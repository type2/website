&gt; In response to Alistair's question on the EDTA use in batteries, my GUESS
&gt; is that the EDTA functions as a chelator for all divalent ions.  EDTA has

&gt; to the free ion concentration) In lead acid batteries, the lead exists as
&gt; Pb+2 when it is in solution.  Maybe adding EDTA complexes the Pb+2 such that
&gt; it doesn't react and form the slightly insoluble sulfate salts
&gt;

&gt; it doesn't react and form the slightly soluble sulfate salts whixh can then

Actually (again, please bare with me, I'm _not_ a chemist at home or at 
work), the sulfate covers the plates in a crytalline form, preventing the 
lead from reacting _well enough_ with the electrolyte.
