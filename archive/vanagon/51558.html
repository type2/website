&lt;&lt; Hey Bob - do you have any thoughts ref throttle position while doing
 compression checks? &gt;&gt;

Austin,

You can prop the throttle open if you wish.  Drawing fuel thru the carb isn't
a problem when all of the spark plugs are removed.  With the plugs pulled the
intake manifold is effectively at atmospheric pressure regardless of the
position of the throttle plate.

I've heard it can make a difference but I didn't see it when I tried it both
ways.  This may be a hold-over from working on V8's, or because some
mechanics don't pull all the plugs.

But I'd open the throttle if I were checking compression on a one-lunger :-)
