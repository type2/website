Subject:      motorcyles, step rails, and oil filters

Hi Volks,

Do any of you carry a motorcycle inside your Vanagon?  How do you tie it
down?  Mine just fits between the shifter and the rear seat (middle seat
removed), and I'd like to secure it a little better.

Has anyone determined if one of the step rails (like a running board, say,
from JCWhitney) will fit a Vanagon?

And is there a compelling reason to change the oil filter EVERY time I
change the oil in my boring car, an '86 Honda?  It is relatively
inaccessible, and if I could skip every odd filter change, while still
changing the oil every 2500 miles, I will.

Thanks,

Chris Wyatt
