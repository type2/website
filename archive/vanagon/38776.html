Subject: re: Rusty pipes

    Well made it to the archives on a friends machine and came up
    with the fact that the pipes will likely set me back $130 each in
    steel from VW, but Parts Place swears the later plastic
    replacements will fit and will sell me used for $80 each. I seek
    clarification on this if anyone has actually done the switch, as
    actually I may still be able to get them off a locally junked
    '87. It was in a local yard 4-5 years back when I was looking for
    bus parts and may still be there if it has not been crushed. Even
    if '87 still used steel it should be ideal as it was only on the
    road 4-5 years before being wrecked so I'm hoping it's still
    there.

You're talking about the pipes from heads to thermostat,etc on either 
side of the engine, right? If so, my '88 has steel pipes, and left 
side on mine was replaced 4 yrs ago from dealer (with new engine) for 
$140 CDN. After 160K this pipe still appears new, but van was driven 
more on west coast since, I believe, so much less salt. Let us know 
how you make out on the PS pipes - mine sound about the same as yours 
- pretty scary once I found out how much pressure they hold!
