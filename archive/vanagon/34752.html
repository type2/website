Subject: Better than stickers

To All:

While I agree there is strength in numbers, and that a distinctive sticker
will surely win us a few new recruits to the Vanagon List, the recent flurry
of list sticker messages makes it clear that a: Martha is not aware that real
buses have a divided windscreen, and b: there are are Sticker Cops in almost
every state, eager to dance on your head if you hippify your van with
anything other than officially-approved ways of obscuring your vision.

Even so, continued growth of the list is important to me and I've given it a
lot
of over the last few days.  The answer came to me as I was dropping the
engine out of a '72 bus.  In fact, that's exactly what happened.  

When the Ultimate List Identifier came to me, a light bulb went on over my
head, just like it does in those silly cartoons.  Startled by the flash, I
let
the engine drop catty-cornered out of the vehicle.  Fortunately, the welded
seam of the muffler landed on my shoe, preventing any damage to the muffler.
 And my thumb was conveniently placed to cushion the heat exchanger on
the opposite side, allowing the engine to survive the fall without damage,
although my bellow of pain shattered the light bulb.  I ended up nailed to
the 
ground by a Type IV engine as a rain of glass tinkled down my collar.  For a
time, thoughts of the Vanagon list were far from my mind.

I was down at he local Doc-in-a-Box getting my shoe cut away from my crushed
toes when I remembered the great idea.  Unfortunately, I have a habit of
snapping my fingers when I suddenly remember things, probably because I also
have a habit of suddenly fortgetting things, such as the splint on my broken
thumb.  The untimely finger-snap shot the aluminum guard off my thumb and
into the eye of the Pakistani doctor gingerly trying to separate toes from
shoe leather.  He accidentally stabbed me in the ankle with the scissors.  At
least, I think it was an accident.  Neither I nor the nurse, who was from
Rhwanda, understood Pakistani.  Fortunately, the bill was in English.
Getting stabbed in the ankle added $178 to the bill, which was already larger
than the price of a good engine overhaul.

It wasn't until I was driving home that my Great Idea came back to me.
Naturally, I snapped my fingers.  The little aluminum thing, which costs
$58.40, flew out the window but didn't hit anyone.  I made up a replacement
when I got home.  Cost a nickle, mebbe less.  Installed it with electrical
tape.
Works fine, I can even type with it and the black tape hides the grease.   

My idea is to use flags.  Not itty-bitty stickers but big five-foot high,
seven-foot long flags!  On an ten-foot flagstaff mounted on the rear bumper
with a steady-clip to the rain gutter.  Streaming out behind your bus, such a
banner would be unmistakable, especially if it were of distinctive pattern.
Perhaps a bold black &amp; white checkered pattern.

But that was only part of my Great Idea.  A sticker or a flag attached to a
VW van merely identifies what is already known, VW van owners can recognize
each other at a mile or more, the flag or sticker only serves to narrow down
the classification.  What we need is to identify ourselves even when NOT
driving, when we don't have our vans for identity badges.  That's where the
flag is superior to the sticker.  

Take the flag with you when you park.  

Go on, unlatch it from the rain gutter, lift it out of the pole-foot and
carry that puppy into Wal-Mart as you go.  Or the barber shop.  Or the Mall.
And WAVE that sucker.  Let's hear it snap!  Put John Phillip Souza on your
Walkman and turn the knob up to 9.  Everyone will soon know there is a
Vanagon list subscriber marching down the mall.

Of course, this idea isn't for everyone, and a ten-foot flag isn't suitable
for all occasions.  Such as when you have one foot in a cast, for example.

I suppose I could put a Vanagon sticker on my cast and wave my cane in time
to the 'Washington Post March', round up a few new Vanagon List recruits that
way.  

I wonder how late Wal-Mart stays open?
