Carl and Listmembers,

Carl, thanks for your continued sleuthing.

Let me pass this on:  Regarding KYB GasAdjust rear shocks for the Syncro
(which I am very happy with), the Syncro rear is not the same as the

the standard ones first and they extend about 1 1/2 inch shorter.  On
the second try, they got me the correct ones.
