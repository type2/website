Subject: RE: Placement of list sticker


&gt;I also like Martha Rubin's suggesting of one in front- center top
&gt;of windshield seems safe enough- area is blocked by the rear view mirror.
&gt;But be careful- CA state vehicle code specifies lower-right corner ONLY
&gt;for front-window  stickers, and yes, it is a safety issue. Maybe on the
&gt;Front Bumper is best for front stickers.

I lived in an apartment complex where they required that you have a
sticker to park in their parking lot. They told you to put the sticker
directly on the front (FIF) of the rear view mirror (yes, the &quot;back&quot; of
it as you see it from the driver's seat). So, it's visible from in front
of the car as you stand or drive in front of it. And, technically it's
not on the windshield at all, so satisfying the ICSW (Irrelevant
California Safety Weenies).

Only if you have a windshield that's EXTREMELY tinted at the top, might
this be a problem. BTW, have you checked out the number of stickers all
over various corners and edges of the windshields of cars in CA and
elsewhere? No crashes yet have been attributed to these stickers, fuzzy
dice, glittery crystal things, dashboard shrines, etc.-- ICSWs take note.

How about putting a sticker on your rear-view mirrors, ladies and gents?
(In addition to the one on the bottom left corner of your rear window,
of course!  :^)   )
