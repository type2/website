Subject: &quot;EV&quot; Panel Van Sighting???

While in Calgary this week I nearly stuffed he rental Contour into a snow
bank as what seemed to be &quot;EV&quot; panel van with &quot;Autohaus&quot; graphics drove by.


Just another remnant of late '60s ingestions or are the &quot;truck&quot; versions
sold in Canada?
