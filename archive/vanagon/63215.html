Hi,

Spoke to them yesterday.  they are working on the conversion steadily,
it has (finally) passed pollution tests (CARB?) but they haven't
actually received its smog certificate.  They said that most of the
calls they are getting are from Syncro owners, like 10:1 instead of
2WD.  Basically they have everything needed ready to go.  Still no price
on the full kit, est at $1500, but adapter+flywheel/flexplate is
$520/420 for std/auto trans.

Glitches are you will need a better starter, Sub is 9.7:1 compression,
so factor in another $150 for KEP.  On Syncros they will machine down
the bell housing starter face and reweld for $80 to allow a longer more
powerful starter to clear the diff lock servo.  No such probs without
diff lock. Bonus on the Syncros is that the lowered engine _may_ not
need their modified air intake plenum, the 2WD vans need to keep the
deck lid flush.  I will go for the basic adapter/flywheel kit, fabricate
cross bar /exhaust locally.  Likely worth buying is their Subaru/vanagon
FI wire harness diagram/info, $35.

I don't know what a mass mailing would get you from KEP since this is an
active and 'pet' project.  May overwhelm them or??. A group purchase
with firm deposits etc. might be worth a decent discount. Even a group
of say 10 should get some sort of deal.


Bye, Tim

'87 Syncro Westy
'85 CrewCab

both of which could benefit from a Subaru motor.
