Subject: List split

Hello fellow Volks,
        I just got back from 3 weeks of being gone. The list has split?
Water here and Air somewhere else! Too bad.
        I have a waterboxer now, but after I sell the 86 syncro I'll bet I
get another bus within 6 months. (I did make it a year without a bus once).
I guess I'm going to have to get on the aircooled list too.
        If anyone is interested while I was zipping thru Iron Mountain
Michigan I saw a lot with lot's of vw's. Bug and busses, westies, regular
vans, new and old. Now 10 vw busses in one spot is a lot for up here. Iron
Mountain is some distance from most everywhere, but it's nice country and if
your looking for some where to go...
