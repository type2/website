From: &quot;Charles \&quot;luke\&quot; Lukey&quot; &lt;74301.2203_at_CompuServe.COM&gt;
Subject: FS: 1986 GL

For Sale:

 1986 VW Vanagon GL.  137k, new waterpump, fresh Autobahn coolant (last week!)
Berg Shift kit, Blaupunkt AM/FM cassette, silver paint, factory wheelcovers.

 Includes an NOS front bumper, new bumper caps (when and *if* WCM decides to
ship them) that will be installed as soon as the local panel beater gets back
from vacation.

 I like this bus a lot, but my wife cannot get used to the 4 speed gearbox. In
Seattle you have to be *very* good at clutchwork to survive.  Also need room
in the driveway for the '88 Wolfsburg autostick I bought for her.

 $4900.00  Please reply via p-mail or give me a call (days) at (206) 783-1779.
Thanks!
