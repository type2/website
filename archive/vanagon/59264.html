Subject: Sticky Throttle Linkage 87 GL

Volks,
My 87GL Autoboxer's throttle linkage is sticky, hard to push to floor
and slow to return to idle. Where are the best points to lube and how to
do it. How can the cable be properly lubed? And the linkage shown in the
Bentley beneath the throttle pedal. Any and all tips on this
appreciated. 
Regards
