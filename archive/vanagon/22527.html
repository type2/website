&gt; 
&gt; I am new to the list and think its great.  You guys really are crazy.
&gt; I thought I would tap in to your vast collective knowledge for some
&gt; advice.  I am considering purchasing a 1972 vw van.  It is sort of 
&gt; rusty because it was submerged in a pond for about 3 years.  The 
&gt; engine has been replaced with a TIII engine, but it has no compression 
&gt; on #3 and ranges from about 60-90 psi on the rest.  The automatic 
&gt; transmission slips if you go uphill so it probably needs to be rebuilt.
&gt; I want it to have air conditioning &amp; I found a guy who can put a 
&gt; Mercedes delivery truck a/c unit on the roof.  Do you think $3500 is 
&gt; too much for this van?  A friend says he thinks he can make it into 
&gt; a camper.
Wow! You *are* going to lower it, right? Those darn things sit way too
high for me. My dad paid $10,000 for a bitchin' 52 deluxe, which I had
the top chopped 6 inches on. I also had a rear hatch put in, since there
wasn't one back there, just some barn door thing. Anyway, check it out
in the next VW T &amp; A magazine, with my naked 17 year old girlfriend
posing with it.
