     &gt;NEVER
     &gt;get behind a
     &gt;VW BUS

     I picked up one of those magnetic NEVER signs at Busses Beside the
     Arch and it DOES incite some antics among the non-bus drivers...

     Typically it is a heavy traffic situation, say three lanes, me
     in the right. Mr/Ms Type A is behind somewhere, jumping between all
     three lanes to gain maximum millisecond advantage. They are in another
     lane when they see a big open space behind me (created when the last
     person to read the sign vacated), so they cross over, accelerate up to
     my bumper, and just as they plan to jump over to the center lane, they
     get closed out by someone else.

     Adrenalin has already been high, I suspect, and they are cooling their
     heels behind a Syncro Westie, and do not seem inclined to take a
     moment to appreciate the uniqueness of this magnificent vehicle.
     Instead, they  are fuming, outsmarted by the brownian motion of the
     traffic.  Then, on the great silver wall blocking their progress, they
     notice my little green sign: &quot;NEVER get behind a VW BUS&quot;.

     Hooo boy! The horn honks. Every five seconds. They practice
     inch-of-your life tailgating.  Finally they do get past, and I get the
     their horn AND the their finger!

     Maybe I should be get some of those european rear fog lights to flash
     them, or one of those Hella third brake lights like Joel's,..but maybe
     its not in the nature of a bus. I could just take the sign off, until
     the next VW Van meet....
