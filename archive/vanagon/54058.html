There are a lot of German factories working on custom high roofs which
have lower wind resistance than that one you saw. The high roof as you
described is looking like the VW factory one as the Safare camper is
also VW factory made.

Hey all,
Today while driving by the local VW dealer I saw a Vanagon sitting in the
lot apparently awaiting servicing.  Why anyone would take it to the dealer
is beyond me, but that's another story :) .  This Vanagon was an air-cooled
model and had a non-Westfalia camper coversion.  It had a white fiberglas
roof similar to the roof on David Schwarze's Safare camper, with the
sliding windows on the sides of the high-roof.  The camper was beige and
the roof was white, looked like it added a couple feet to the van.  Anyone
know what company made this type of conversion for Vanagons?  Could it have
been a Safare?

I've not seen this one around town before, thought it was kinda interesting
:)

Sean
