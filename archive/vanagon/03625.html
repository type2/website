&quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_tim_dot_com&gt; says:

&gt; THe chassis number on my '56 Kombi (217692)  Is registered as a '57, 
&gt; St. Muir sez its a '56, Wolfsburg West sez its a '56, but the bus stop
&gt; sez its a 57.  I don't know of any fetaure that was different between those
&gt; two years, so that isn't any help so far...

Comparing these two catalogs, it looks like WW is using calendar 
year numbers, but Bus Stop is treating anything manufactured 
since the middle of 1956 as a '57 model year.  Your bus must have 
been manufactured in late 1956.  WW goes to the model year method
in 1962;  starting then, the two lists are consistent. 

I had thought that VW had gone to a model year concept back in 
the early 50's???
