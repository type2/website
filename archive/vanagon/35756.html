Subject: RE: 83 vanagon wobbles


&gt;It seems as if my &quot;radhaus&quot; steering wheel &quot;wobbles&quot; when I drive at slow
&gt;speeds, ie 5-10 mph.  I know I'm not giving much to go on, but if you
&gt;could give your 2 cents I would like to read.

Sounds like either your front tires are way low, or they are out of round
(worn) and need to be replaced!

Not good...
