&gt;&gt; The two effects cancel, thus making northern drivers
&gt;&gt; look like the rest of humanity.   :^)

&gt;well, except for the fact that we need XXL shirts and have no clear
&gt;demarkation as to where facial hair ends and body hair begins.


Quite true. I guess shaving off my beard and 'stache, upon moving
to Colorado, made me forget...

But let us not also forget the scars on the knuckles, caused by
impact with the pavement as my northern VW aficionado brothers and
sisters walk.

Uff da,
