My problem is getting really, really annoying. 
Here are the symptoms:
It dies when it gets warm.  I go about a block and then when the engine
revs high, it looses power, and dies at the first opportunity.
I push the van home (It's only a block), and then the van won't start for
a few days.  Most recently, it started after I screwed with the points,
but they seem o.k., and it won't start now.
What could make it die like this?  Can the cold start valve/thermo time
switch do that if it's bad?  Is it the brain?  What else?

BTW, it's a '77 bus with a 2000 cc engine.

grr.
