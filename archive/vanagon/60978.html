&gt; Fellow listees,
&gt; 
&gt; I have acquired a few brand new OEM 091 4-speed Vanagon transmissions, some
&gt; automatics, and even some (extremely rare) 5-speeds with the (in)famous Audi
&gt; 5-cylinder bell-housing as sold in South Africa and other parts of the world,
&gt; as part of a package deal along with some other parts that I needed. I
&gt; haven't yet figured out how much I'm into them yet, but I will, in a day or
&gt; two, after I've inventoried the lot. If anyone out there is interested in any
&gt; of these trannies, either e-mail me, or call (714)771-3763 (work)9-5PST, or
&gt; (714)283-2966. 
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;
