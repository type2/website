   So Mike says:

&lt;&lt;   I was just wondering if any of you veteran van campers could give  me an
idea of how best to pack your van. Any tips that you could give at all on things
like:
  where best to store certain items
  how to keep things from banging around while your driving
  extra things that just us Westie camper people should maybe bring, or
  that would be helpful.....&gt;&gt;


   To keep things from moving about, &quot;slip stop&quot;, &quot;scoot guard&quot;, etc.  Port-A
Potti is indispensible, it rides behind passenger seat and never leaves the van.

   In my '89 I use the &quot;wardrobe&quot; to stuff sleeping bags and other bedding.
2 long Rubbermaid silverware trays in the valence over the sink hold more than
the valence alone, there's room for three, at least.  I keep matches, spices, 30
amp adapter and AC tester,  flashlights,batteries, etc.  It really augments the
drawer.  I've replaced the incandescent fixture above the rear table with a
fluorescent and added another above the sink, a necessity IMO.  There's also a
12v oscillating fan just ahead of rear light fixture.

   The front seats have bungee neting on the rear for Rand Mcnalley, hats,
gloves etc. Between the seats or on table behind driver we keep a covered
plastic container 16Lx11Wx6H for other books and maps.

   Under rear seat  Between ECU &amp; heater I keep a quart of oil, a liter of
coolant/H2O mix, hose repair kit &amp; clamps, 12V air pump, spare belts.  Opposite
side left is a clip fan &amp; light, cube heater, water hose power cord.
This space becomes the clothes hamper once we're underway.

   On bed cushion behind seat I use matching grey vinyl covering for protection
from abrasion and dirt.  Sitting on this are a grey water jug with short hose
which stores inside it, 2 small Rubbermaid roughneck tubs for outside
dishwashing, a flip top container for Coleman stove, small lantern, etc.
There's room for at least three of these tubs for an extended trip. I use a
Roll-A Table, and telescoping director's chairs, purchased at REI.  I'll also
bring a cheapo screen room for extended campground stays.
  
   In &quot;linen closet&quot; is enough clothing for up to 4 day getaways.  for longer
trips, we use duffel bags and backpacks for clothing.  In the space under the
closet are jumper cables and 2 folded triangle reflectors.  On shelf at top of
hatch is remaining reflector, folding saw, entrenching tool and other flattish
items which won't interfere with operation of AC.

   I'm able to keep the van packed and ready for quick trips at any time.  This
saves a lot of energy and forgetting of vital items.
