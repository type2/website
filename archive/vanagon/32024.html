Subject: Re: Flaky fuel gauge

&gt;I had a problem with my gauge a while back, never registered more than half
full.
&gt;I think it was a post from Andy Erskine that suggested having a look at the
gauge itself,
&gt;there is a coilish bit of wire in the gauge, this was encrusted with I
don't know what.
&gt;But after a quick gentle brush I put the gauge back in the dash and lo, it
worked fine.
&gt;Bizarre, I never did understand black magic.

Yep, that was me. I'd checked the wiring, the voltage stabiliser and the
sender and couldn't work it out. Even the gauge seemed to work OK when I
tested it on the bench. As a last resort I took it apart (needs a delicate
touch) and found what looked like carbon on the coil in there. I scraped it
off with a knife and it's worked fine since.
