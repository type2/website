&lt;&lt; I don't intend to tow
the sailboat BUT I have an 18.5 ft. kevlar canoe that I'd like to be
able to mount on top.  It only weighs 42 lbs. but the wind can really
&quot;rack&quot; the thing around if it gusts.  My concern is this:  Can the top
of the Westies handle this type of twisting?  If so, do the gas shocks
on the pop-top have enough oommph to hold the canoe up or would I need
to unload the canoe everynight (and chain it to the axle!)&gt;&gt;

I put my 16ft aluminum canoe on top of my 85 Westy with foam blocks. I
tie down the front and rear to the bumpers and a 'safety' strap accross
the canoe attaching to the rain gutter just behind the driver and
passenger front doors. (I use three motorcycle tie down straps).

Wind isn't a problem. In fact, I find that I get about 3-4 mpg better
than without it on the highway.

The pop top isn't held up by gas shocks (at least my 85 isn't). Its held
in place by a folding bar assembly. (Kinda like locking your elbow - or
so my 5 year old tells me). It would seem kinda awkward to keep the
canoe on top. I unload it everynight. Takes longer to unhook my tie down
straps than it does to actually take the canoe down.

I don't chain my canoe to anything although I do carry a chain and lock
in case. I generally try to take my family only to places where locking
things and safety are not a concern. If it is, then maybe we're not
camping at the right place. Once we 'set up' camp, things are pretty
much unsecure when we go fishing or on a hike, etc...

Thats my 2 cents.  BTW, I alternate towing a hobie cat sail boat (for
sale ... shameless plug) and a 3 rail motorcycle trailer (with Goldwing)
behind my van.  Been doing it for years and works great if you don't
mind draining the remaining power left in a 1.9l after you put your foot
on the gas pedal.  :-)

Happy Camping!
