 EV'ers:


        Thanks to those of you who sent suggestions about what happened
to my EV. It turns out that although I didn't smell any gas, fuel wasn't
the problem, the distributor was. It's been replaced on warranty. Isn't
this awfully early for a distributor to die? Seems like 10 years and 160k
is about what I would expect. Maybe that's why they replaced it on warranty.
I pick up the van this afternoon. Since I provided misleading info, the Wendy's
offer is good for all entrants!

      PS: Anyone else lose a distributor at 42k?
