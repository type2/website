Subject: Campground Recommendation

This is for any listee who has camped in the Okangan Valley in British
Columbia.  I am looking for recommendations for a campground anywhere from
Vernon south to the US border.  My brother and his family would like to
join us, so if the campground also offered rustic cabins it would be a
bonus.  Any ideas, suggestions and recommendations are welcome.  

Thanks
