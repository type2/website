Subject: Re: mufflers

GT asks:

&lt;&lt; Are there any aftermarket mufflers available for a 89 vanagon? Like a 
 flowmaster or something with a little &quot;rumble&quot;?  &gt;&gt;

We offer a USA made Turbo-Style Quiet muffler that flows better than the
stock muffler, but is about as quiet as the stock.  Bolts right to your
existing Catalytic Converter and has a permanent tailpipe attached as well.
 Part number 210-25107, price is $117.50.

Dee (BugPack) offers for the 79-83 Cal Models a Monza Style muffler with a
flared dual tip that does sound a little throatier than the stock muffler,
but I know nothing of it's flow characteristics.  But it's made to slip into
the left exhaust supply elbow pipe, no flanges (the way the stock ones
installed on that year period), but I'm sure a good muffler/exhaust shop
could weld the proper flanges in place and modify it for your installation.
 We haven't offered this muffler style in quite awhile, due to lack of
inquiries (most people wanna quiet their exhaust, not make it &quot;rumble&quot;).  But
we can still get them - Part number 210-25024, price is $98.99
