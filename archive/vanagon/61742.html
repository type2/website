Subject: re: Shocking grease!

Hi Ron, could the plastic on your steering wheel be in contact with the 
plastic housing underneath the steering wheel?
Mine was and it made an awful screeching noise...fix was to remove and 
reinstall the housing.

Howdy,

My Van's making that annoying scraping noise when I turn the wheel.  Sorin
and I both suspect the horn contact (if we're wrong, please correct us.)

If I wish to grease this, is there any sort of 'conductive' grease, or is
all grease conductive?

p.s.  See what I mean about needing a mechanics course?
