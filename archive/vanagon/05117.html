ha! one of my old bosses used to have TWO of those. the only two in the
whole state of alabama. they were DKW Juniors. and they are/were truly
two-strokes. when you lifted the hood to fill the gas tank, you had a small
oil tank to fill as well. front wheel drive, so they were good in snow and
ice. and i believe they were 3-cylinders. not much to look at but they just
just kept going and going and going ...

wasn't DKW one of the four companies that merged to form Audi (which is
what the four linked rings represent)?  if so, DKW was like a 2nd cousin
to the beetle. :)

column in Road &amp; Track. :)
