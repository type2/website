When a bus (or Vanagon, for that matter) has an in-line engine stuffed in
the back in place of the proper boxer, is that engine installed inline with
the vehicle, as in an Audi, or transversally, as in a Golf or present Pas-
sat?  I've never looked in the back of a diesel Vanagon, so I have no clue.
I would think the inline arrangement would be a tight fit, but would allow
the use of the standard Typ II transaxle, while the Golf arrangement might
allow the whole engine/transmission from the car to be used, but with the
enginer laid over flat.

Edjicate me.
