Hows everyone doing in VW land.  Well I have posted 2 bumper stickers to my 
home page and I was woundering if you all out there could give me some feedback
on them.  Do you like them.  Should I sell them and would you buy them.  Well 
they can  be seen at http://www.cis.ohio-state_dot_edu/~winemill
Thanks for any info
Brad
