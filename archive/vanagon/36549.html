&gt;Volks,
&gt;	I'm trying to track down dpd, the makers of the air conditioner in
&gt;my bus.  Another bus I saw at the junkyard last weekend has the same A/C
&gt;as mine, with a sticker on it that said &quot;dpd manufacturing, San Antonio,
&gt;Tx.&quot;.  Well I called the 1-800 directory service, and directory
&gt;assistance in San Antonio, and there are no listings for dpd in either
&gt;place.  I also searched the web and came up with nothing.  Does anyone
&gt;know if this company is still in business, and if so where they are or
&gt;how to get a hold of them?  I want to find out if the plastic covers for
&gt;the A/C units are still available.  The one in the junkyard is much
&gt;nicer than mine, but it will be a lot of work to remove and if I can buy
&gt;a new one I'd rather just do that instead.  Thanks in advance...
&gt;
&gt;

Most of the VW bus A/C units were made by this company.  I did track them
down many years ago.  They would not sell to me direct.  Something about VW
contract.  Anyway,  they probably don not make any parts that have been
discontinued for seven years.  VW dealer should be able to gett part# for you
and you can then ask them to locate.  That will at least tell you if it is
available.  Go for that used one.  The spare parts inside are worth having.
 Especially the blower motor.
