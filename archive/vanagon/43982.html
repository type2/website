A local junkyard was removing the gas tank from some kind of big
Chevy, they cut the straps off with a torch, the straps came off, the
tank fell on the straps, you can guess what happed next:  the tank still
had some gas in it, the straps were red hot, the tank exploded.

Moral of the story--stay away from Chevy's.
