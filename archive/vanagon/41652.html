Subject: Re: 3 Questions


&gt;    Howdy!?!  I would appreciate answers/experiences in response to these three 
&gt; questions....I have an '81 Westy(2000cc,FI)
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Can I get to the oil cooler without pulling the engine?  I once lost a dune 
&gt; buggy by running it with 1/2 inch of crud on the leading edge...I see some of 
&gt; that same kinda crud on the blades of my cooling fan.....
&gt;
If you can get the cooling tin, fan shroud and air duct off you might 
be able to clean it somewhat. I think the motor must be out to really 
get to it. 
&gt; 2)  Is it possible for me to get to the head bolts without pulling the engine?  
&gt; The guy I just bought it from wasn't too fond of tightening things to specs...
&gt; 
Yes! after pulling mine I see that you can remove the FI intake 
manifold, then the tin and get to the upper bolts, for the lower 
bolts simply remove the valve covers and rocker arms and they are 
easily accesible. Not easy but possible. You have to take the tin off 
either way.
&gt; 3)  This may be a stupid question:  So I changed the oil for the first time in 
&gt; the week or so since first purchase...cleaning the strainer and I found sizeable 
&gt; chonks/grindings of metal...is it time to start building another engine, or am I 
&gt; just paranoid?
&gt; 
I find chunks of gasket and other un-identifiable stuff but don't 
worry too much. If I found hunks of valves and rings I be looking.
