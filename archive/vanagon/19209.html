Subject: another accessory..

I just got one of those hand-held GPS (Global Positioning  System) units
since I all be doing alot of science in small boats along coastal N.E.
Last night I laid it on the dash and cruised homed at doing 49.8 knots.
Not only does it give my position (in Lat./Long.) and speed but also elevation
as well as a plot of my course... It does many other things like current 
heading and allows you to plan stops along the way in which the thing will
prompt you as you approach your waypoint.  The one I got is a Garmin GPS
45 now on sale at West Marine for $299.  Martha, forget the microwave....
