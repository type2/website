&gt; &gt; A Gas company up here in Ottawa has Ethanol blend at the same price as
&gt; &gt; regular. I asked him if it was good for air cooled engines and his answer
&gt; &gt; was it has 15% higher octane, runs cleaner and cooler. Any opinions,
&gt; &gt; advice, experience with using ethonal blend  for air-cooled Vanagon engines?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; BTW its 55 cents CDN per litre up here.....DC

&gt; &gt; There was an interesting article in _Porsche Panorama_ about oxygenated fuels
&gt;   about a year ago. On vehicles with oxygen sensors, very little changes 
&gt;   except fuel mileage which drops (there's less heat available in Ethanol). On
&gt;   vehicles without O2 Sensors, exhaust emissions were shown to drop along with
&gt;   driveability and fuel economy. The air to fuel ratio for ethanol is different
&gt;   than that for gasoline (numerically lower) so unless one can richen up their
&gt;   mixture the engine effectively runs lean. 
&gt; 
&gt;   There was also considerable discussion of the corrosive nature of the 
&gt;   oxygenators. Although not as bad as methanol, Ethanol is more corrosive
&gt;   than gasoline. The article suggested using gasoline containing MTBE (Methyl
&gt;   Tertiary Butyl Ether???) because it is less corrosive but I have not been 
&gt;   able to find a gas station employee yet who could tell me what their      
&gt;   company was using as an oxygenator. The article said that ethanol smells
&gt;   sweet and MTBE smells like formaldehyde. I think all gasoline smells like
&gt;   sh*t, so I haven't followed this up.

This is interesting and paradoxical, since we normally associate a leaner
running engine with higher fuel economy. But if I understand you
correctly, the engine will run leaner with Ethanol AND fuel consumption
will also increase. Is this correct? This plus the potential corrosion
could spell trouble, yes? DC --
