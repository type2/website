&gt;&gt;First, moralists will argue right/wrong
&gt;&gt;over just about anything but as Socrates stated in  one of his little 
known
&gt;&gt;treatises &quot;The Nature of the German People's Car&quot;:  &quot;moral debate does not
&gt;&gt;apply to VWs&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Wow!
&gt;
&gt;You wouldn't last two rounds with the Cruise Director, but *I* am
&gt;impressed. My last spin doctor quit over the fallout from the Statuatory
&gt;Incident. You want a job? We'll go on the campaign trail. Or trial,
&gt;whichever.
&gt;
&gt;My handlers suggest this slogan:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Hooper. Jiminy thinks he's a Real Live Boy!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Whaddya think?


I think that the quest to produce a totally incomprehensible thread,
has finally borne fruit.   :^)
