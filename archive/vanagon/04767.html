opinions are always thin ice. :)

&gt;To normal people, a mature adult that willingly spends their hard earned
&gt;money on any Volkswagen Bus/Van (and then proceeds to force spouses,
&gt;children, dogs, etc. to ride in it), is far more foolish than any kid who
&gt;chooses use money he makes from his after school job to trick out his ride
&gt;in the style du jour.

wrong.
when a teenager does it, it's foolish waste of money.

when an adult does it, it's a carefully considered expenditure of vital
financial resources for the sole purpose of mental health and recreational
pleasure.

it all depends on whose ox is getting gored, don't it. ;)

&gt;mirror I see a sucker who sold a rock-solid maintenance-free Toyota truck
&gt;to be there.

you are suffering from a severe case of Buyer's Remorse. as a continual
sufferer for many years, i can tell you that you need to buy a Project Car.
pick a British car ... it'll make your bus seem like heaven.
