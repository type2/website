Subject: Re: Stealing vs Kharma cleanser

Steal plywood (much less anything else)? Naw, we bus drivers prefer clean a
Khama. Alot of our buses are &quot;faith-mobiles.&quot; Ya never know when the clutch
or throttle cable will snap on ya. Good thing we know you were kidding.

I started to steal it right then and there, but reconsidered given the eyes
on me. &lt;snip&gt; Personally I rather like the ability to put poetry magnets on
the roof ;-)
