Subject: Re:  westfalia restoration articles from HOT VWs

&gt; I have Part 2-6 but am missing Part 1. Someone like to swap?
&gt; BTW, I don't think there was a part 7.
&gt; 
&gt; And people thought I was crazy for saving issues of Hot VW's!

I may have it, but I cant get to any of it until later this month (I'm
out town at the moment).  Do you remember the title of the article?
