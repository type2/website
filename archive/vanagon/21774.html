Subject: Re: oil leak stains

To clean the oil,trans fluid and other gunk I left on the garage floor,  I
went to the store and got the cheepest clay cat litter i could  find.  I then
spread it on the floor put some music on and danced on the litter.  When I
had danced until I could dance no more, i sweeped up the litter to view the
nice clear floor.
