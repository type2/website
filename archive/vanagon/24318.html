&gt; i've run across a 21 window, suntop, rusted (badly) body, good runner
&gt; it needs a rear bumper and a new canvas top right away....
&gt; as i'm new to the world of VW's, i really have nothing to go on except
&gt; my instinct which tells me the 3000.00 price is about twice what it's
&gt; worth...any and all input on this would be very much appreciated

Yup, wayyyy too much.  

I know a kid who got a 23 window in that condition for $200.

Keep looking, unless you REALLY want a project...

Where is this by the way? I'm curious to see what geographic areas are 
getting for what kinda busses.
