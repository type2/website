Subject: Re: Replacing seats



&gt;I have two front seats from I think a 78 Westy. Is there any easy way to
&gt;install them in a 74 Westy or do I have to move the upholstery over to the
&gt;original seats?
&gt;
Pre '77 and post '77 Westy drivers side have slightly different seat 
tracks, so you'll have to use some ingenuity.  Also, the passenger seats 
for '74 and '78 are completely different; the '74 seat clips to the wall 
behind the seat, whereas the '78 Westy passenger side has no wall and uses 
the same seat track as the drivers side.  You might be able to get away 
with just bolting the passenger seat in place.

By the way, are you aware that there is a Type 2 list for pre-79 Buses?
