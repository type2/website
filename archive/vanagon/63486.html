Subject: Re: removing radiator


Not a problem.  The A/C lines are long enuf (once you unbolt them from the
frame) to allow the condenser to be taken off the rad.  Make a hanger out of
coat-hangers or something to hold up the condenser, once disassembled.


 &gt;I need to do exactly the same thing (need to replace the radiator on our
 &gt;87, but don't especially want to disconnect the AC...
 &gt;
 &gt;Any one done this?

 &gt;&gt;Has anyone dropped the radiator out of an 89 vanagon with air conditioning.
 &gt;&gt;I have'nt seriously tried it yet, but the two freon lines running
 &gt;&gt;underneath the the radiator appear to have it stopped from dropping
 &gt;&gt;straight down. Do these lines have to be removed or is there room to jockey
 &gt;&gt;the radiator around them?
