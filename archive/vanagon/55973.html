Subject: Re: Test driving '87 syncro - what to check?

&gt;If you pull this knob and drive ahead slowly, a light over the rear diff
&gt;schematic should show red. This indicates that the rear differential is
&gt;locked. If you try to take a tight turn you will find the front wheels
&gt;will tend to plow. If you push in the knob and drive ahead slowly, the
&gt;light show go out and you will have returned to normal drive.

The light on my '86 Syncro GL diff lock is green.
