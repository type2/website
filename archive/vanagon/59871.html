&gt;At the beginning of each season I am having to recharge my ac at a cost of
&gt;$75-125. Does anyone else have this problem with there AC. What could be the
&gt;problem. Last year I replaced the &quot;o&quot; ring so it is not that. Thanks for any
&gt;help. Dan

i've had good luck by running the a/c for about 15-20 minutes EACH WEEK,
ALL year. yup. even/especially in winter. only trouble for some folks is:
if the outside temp gets down about 40F, the a/c won't turn on. but for
those of us in the more temperate climes, it's worked well for me. i've been
four years now without adding freon (although i think i'll double-check it
this month and see).
