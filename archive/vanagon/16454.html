Subject: More New Owner questions

1) I looked at John Muir's book today, and it doesn't seem to cover water-cooled
   engines.  In fact, it explicitly said that Volkswagons use air and oil to
   cool, and that's it.

   Is this book useful to the owner of a 1990 camper?  (The first thing I want
   to do is change to the Autobahn coolant.)

2) Who was making flue caps?  Any left?

3) What are the best floor mats?

Thanks again, folks, for all of your help.

Ron
