So David Carment says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	In some cases this still seems to be true. VW mechanics we talked
&gt; to told us :&quot;FI systems are prone to running lean&quot;; &quot;Parts are
&gt; outrageously expensive&quot;; &quot;they are difficult fix without the proper
&gt; equipment&quot; and so on. As a  consequence in fixing a problem they tend to
&gt; replace parts rather than diagnose and fix the problem.....DC
&gt;  

I agree, especially because alot of times you can't change just one integral
part of a mechanism. You have to by a whole new mechanism.  What a waste of
money and resources.  An armiture is broken on your wiper, you have to by
the whole wiper assembly.  Urg!!  

Your right too about the swapping theory.  Some friends of ours had a 
real nice vanagon bus and they had the hesitation problem and the 
dealer swapped out every part of the F.I. system.  They ended up in
arbitration and eventually were paid almost the full price of the
van.  What a waste of money and time for both parties.  Any technician
worth his salt would not waste his time in this way and try to track
down the real problem.  And I sure wouldn't pay shop prices for that
kind of non-sense.
