&gt;        On to the listserv.  I'm trying to set up listserv

&gt;        Why?  Those forwarding-thinking people may have made a link between
&gt;my job as a SysAdmin, my love for busses, and a request for list server
&gt;software...

Non-forward thinking people might need it explained to them, though. (?)

If it's what I think it is, you don't want Majordomo if you can help it. It
isn't even an application, it's a perl script. I think you'll find listserv
to be much more configurable if you can get it compiled. I'm so
disappointed with Majordomo that I'm planning a full-time connection so I
can run ListStar from home. You wouldn't believe the options Majordomo
doesn't have...

Thinking about it, if you can't get listserve made, there are a battery of
cgi scripts (some of them in C, if I remember right, so they're fast) for
running a message board off your web page. I have some bookmarks if you
want them. Lawd, I wish I had root access, there are so many improvements I
could make. ;)
