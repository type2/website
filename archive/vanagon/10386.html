Subject: Re: 1964 micro manual!


Steve Walker described his Original Owner's manual...

But what Steve really has is VW's replacement owner's manual. VW
at least during the 60s would print &quot;generic&quot; owner's manuals
for bugs and busses. For example I have a couple (one in German)
which cover bugs built from 1954 to 1960, and another covering
1961 through 64.

Hold onto the manual, its still a valuable source of info, trivia, 
etc...What you should be looking for is a blue covered manual
for TRANSPORTERS for your particular year.
