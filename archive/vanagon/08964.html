Thom Fitzpatrick reminissed about a fellow abusing himself on the
road...once, about 12 years ago, while driving to Boston, I
passed by a driving school car whose driver seemed to be in
a state of bliss because the female passenger was leaning
across the  front seat, her head bobbing up and down...rather
unusual considering the road was not bumpy...

I also noticed a CB antenna on the back of the car (this was in
the days when CBs were still rather popular), so I decided to
alert the rest of the &quot;good buddies&quot; on the road of my sighting..
almost instantaneously, this young lady suddenly sat up erect
(I guess the driver was too...) and slid over to the passenger
side door.

I guess she just must of come from Florida or something because
her face was awfully red...probably sunburn...  ;-)
