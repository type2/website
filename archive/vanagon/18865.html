Subject: Valve adjustments



To All:

Valve adjustments are indeed a thing of the past if your engine is fitted
with hydraulic cam followers.  Fortunately, hydraulic lifters may be
retro-fitted to any air-cooled VW engine although the drop-in type of lifter
does not perform as well as claimed.  I've a couple of length posts lurking
out there which covers the nitty-gritty, including how to make the drop-in
type work.

For those of you still running solid lifers, installation of swivel-foot
adjuster screws (about $16 from J. C. Whitney) allows you to extend the
adjustment interval to five thousand miles or more.  The How-To and
Why-It-Works  is covered in another sermon tacked to the electronic wall.
