Subject: pick-up owner  need wood slats???


i just finished istalling a set of wood slats in my 1960 crew cab resto 
project.  i have a extra set available if anyone out there needs a set.  
they are made out of teak wood.  this is better then the original oak 
because it will last forever.  they look great in the truck.  if you are 
interented in my extra crew cab set or a single cab guy needs a set made 
let me know.  as a not, they are not real cheap because of wood cost.

take care and God Bless
matt
