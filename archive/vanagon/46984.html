Subject: Removing tie rod ends?

To all,

I am trying to remove the drag link from my 74 Westy, but the front 
tie rod end is being a real pain.  I can't get the right angle to 
knock it out with a hammer.  Are there any homemade tools that you 
all have come up with for popping the tie rod end out of the drop 
arm?  Are there any other suggestions?

Thanks
