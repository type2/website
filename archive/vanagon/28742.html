Subject: 1700 Type IV head gaskets &amp; Aluminum cars

So I asked :

I want to pull the heads on a Type IV 1700 soon. As soon as I've clocked
10000 km (6000 mi for the metrically challenged :-). Just to have a look-see.
So - do I need to replace those little aluminum or whatever seals between the
top of the cylinder and the head? Or can I use Injun head on it? Or something
else? 

and nobody replied. So I'm asking again :-)

(Heard in the wings, &quot;persistant bugger, innit?&quot; :-)

Do you guys have Land Rovers over there? Well, they're aluminum too. And
isn't one of the new Audis also, or was that just a concept car I saw?
