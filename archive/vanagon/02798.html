 While ago Aaron VanDerlip quizzickly inclined.
             ^^^^^^^^^ -(I wish I had a fun name. Tho, VonDerlip would     
                        be more volksy)ÿ


   !-i am new to the air cooled world (have a 82 scirocco, it has been a 
   !-very mixed reltationship)

A mixed relationship?? With a VW?? 
 
ÿ
   !- i plan on buying a bus. 
             (just say no)

   !-  So the other day i drove a 79 at it drove great, had plenty of 
       power. 
Power?? In a bus??



   !-  My only 
   !-concerns were two: one that there was a smell, the engine, when the 
   !-heater was turned on,
ÿ
 You got a heater with yours? Mine ('79 Westy GTb) didn't come with one,
might be coolant.

 
   !- two there was a slight ( a few drops) amount of oil leaking from were
   !-i presume the two heads are.  how serious are these two things?

This is not oil!!! It is a HIGHLY contagious fluid... Its transmissibilty
is unmatched in its ability to render the hosts immune system 
defenseless. It quickly transmorgrifies (by transmutational 
transportation) brainwashing the host, making them think it's their
blood (coolant?) There is no cure for this malady... Do not touch,
breathe, or look at this fluid for any length of time. It may not be
too late. Lettuce pray.




My habit was a half a quart every 300 miles. It is now half a quart 
low per 2500 miles, due to a recent (slight) overhaul and tightening
of the loose. (like I need)

You get used to it, and feed it before it gets hungry. Check the oil
in the morning, and after filling with gas. It is a sentient being
and will return your love and efforts. My bus is a good teacher, it
started me out easy, and has taught me all I know about working on
cars,(Ie: it). Daddy tell me again how the water circulates in the
head...(his head, not mine...nothing circulates there but air
&amp; oil)




&quot;come to kindly terms with your ass
 for it bears you&quot;
