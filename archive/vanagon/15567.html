Subject: Re: new van, inspect'n &amp; warrnty questions

The MasterGuard Platnium plan available from a VW dealer is the preferred
warranty company. Most of these warranty companies are quite evil and will
find every possible excuse to get out of repairing your car. For example,
most won't cover *any* car with more than 100K on them no matter what (so
check before laying out your $1K).

On the other hand, you will probably recoup your $1K within the first three
months (just joking, sort of) so you might as well get the warranty. If the
tranny has been &quot;worked on&quot; this is a very troubling thing. 

These trannys are rare enough (read, hard enough) that I have heard of many
rebuilds going bad within a few thousand miles of the &quot;rebuilt&quot; tranny going
back into the vehicle. Exception would probably be a VW rebuild. A
non-factory syncro tranny rebuild item is a very scarey thing indeed.

&gt;I may be soon moving from wannabus to '86 syncro camper. I understand 
&gt;that the engine has about 20K on a rebuild and the trans has been done 
&gt;too.  I don't know what it needed or what was done.  Total miles ~= 110K.
&gt;
&gt;I have a question about extended warranties and this vehicle.  I am going
&gt;to have it inspected by a mechanic today or this weekend to check on cv
&gt;joints, water pump, heads, trans, etc.  I have the opportunity to get a
&gt;warranty called 'Flextech 1' (sp?) that would cover engine, drivetrain,
&gt;electrical, steering, AC for 18 mo.  for $1K.  In your option, is this
&gt;recommended?  How much can an inspection uncover about (un)expected and
&gt;expensive problems?  This list has warned me in the past about $$$$$ 
&gt;maintenance. 
&gt;
&gt;I'll have to pay closer attention to the syncro bits on this list. TIA for 
&gt;your advice.
