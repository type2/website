Hi Mark,

I have a 85 Vanagon GL (and a Bentley Manual as well as the VWoA
Owners Manual and Maintenance Manual) so I will try to answer
questions for you. Please feel free to ask any more that come to mind,
I might not know the answer, but will see if it is in the manual. Or
maybe, if not there we can see if we can figure it out between us. So
here goes...

&gt;After many years of wating and wanting, I am now the proud owner of a 1985
&gt;Auto-Westy Weekender (174K, but in remarkably good shape for a 'northern'
&gt;Vanagon).

&gt;As with many used vehicles, this one didn't come with even a whisper of an
&gt;owner's manual, so I really need some help until the Bentley arrives....

&gt;1.  Power steering.  Found the reservoir -- it's low, but I do not know what
&gt;the recommendation is for fluid type.  ATF dipstick demands Dexron, but the
&gt;PS doesn't say...

The VWoA 1985 Vanagon Owners Manual says ATF Dextron.

&gt;2.  Brake fluid reservoir (here's the Bonehead part).  Where is it?
&gt;I think that I've found everything else (washer fluid containers, fuel tank
&gt;overflow lines, coolant reservoir and expansion tank, extra battery
&gt;compartment and connectors, etc.) just not the master cylinder.  I'd really
&gt;like to make sure that I am not peilously close to a dry cylinder, and all
&gt;help will be appreciated!

Again quoting from the VWoA 1985 Vanagon Owners Manual...

The brake fluid reservoir is located under the instrument cluster in
the dsahboard panel. 

To gain access to the reservoir, grasp the two recesses provided on
the back of the frame cover and pull up.

When replacing the cover, insert the front edge first, then press the
cover down firmly. Make sure it is firmly seated.

The fluid level in the brake fluid reservoir should always be between
the two marks &quot;MAX&quot; and &quot;MIN&quot;. If the brake fluid level falls
considerably below the mark &quot;MIN&quot; the complete brake system should be
thorrughly checked by your VW dealer and the cause corrected.

In the WARNING section it states...

Every two years the brake fluid has to be replaced. See your maintence
booklet.

If brake fluid must be added to the reservoir, use only new and unused
DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid that meets SAE specification J 1703 and
conforms to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 116.

Do not use any other brake fluid, or brake fluid that has absorbed
moisture from the open air, or brake fluid that is dirty. It may cause
premature wear or unreliable braking action.

Do not add or mix DOT 5 silicone type brake fluid with the brake fluid
in your vehicle as severe component corrosion may result. Such
corrosion could lead to brake system failure.

When adding or replacing brake fluid, make certaion to avoid spilling.
Brake fluid will damage fabric, paint, plastics, and metal. Cover the
areas surrounding the reservoir before removing the filler cap.
