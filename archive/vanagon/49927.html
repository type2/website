Subject: 85 shifter problems

Thanks to you all who sent helpful information to me on my 85 Vanagon
shifting problems (140,000 and still goining).  Bled the slave cylinder.
System was fine for about 10 miles, but hard shifting again.  Anyone want to
share how to change out the clutch master cylinder and the clutch slave
cylinder? Do you half to remove the instrument panel to change the clutch
MC? Bleeding proceedure etc.
I am going to try this first before I tackle the tranny.  I got prices on
each unit from a low of $44.00 to a high of $205.00. What about rebuild
kits, is it worth the effort?

Thanks,


Bill Lund
