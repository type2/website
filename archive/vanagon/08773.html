I had an identical problem with the 82 aircooled Westfalia. The engine
would cut out at high speeds. The problem was traced (so VW tells me to:
a collapsed aux. air regulator hose and a faulty idle regulator). Both
were replaced and both are do it yourself jobs. In fact the idle
regulator is identical to those on Audis of the same vintage. There is an
easy way to test both - the hose can be replaced and the idle stab. can be
bypassed......DC
