Some time ago, Dan Houg brought to our attention the 12,000 btu Suburban
furnace sold by Camping World. I hear that the same model is used in the
&quot;Eurobago.&quot; I'm contemplating a purchase for the '75 Westfalia, but would
like to know whether the unit can also be used while driving. Would anyone
know?

TIA :)
