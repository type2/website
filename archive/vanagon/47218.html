&gt; &gt;I just came across a 1985 Westy Synchro w/50k miles for $10k. Is it worth

&gt; &gt;What should I be looking for while cheking it out? Advise??
&gt; 
&gt; I'd never buy any 1985 Syncro.  VW did not start selling them until 1986 as
&gt; 1986 models.  Either it's not a Syncro or it's not a 1985 or someone has
&gt; assembled their own hybrid.  Valid Syncro model years in the USA are 1986,
&gt; 1987, 1989, 1990, &amp; 1991.  Question everything else.
&gt; 
Don't have the bentley handy, but don't the first few letters of 
the serial# tell the model year? This should clear things up (or 
maybe not...)
