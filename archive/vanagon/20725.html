&gt;I am curious...

yellow??    :)

&gt;Are there other people, like myself, who remember peoples' Bus-names
&gt;but not the peoples' names? I will use as an example, &quot;Das Boot&quot; and
&gt;&quot;Bozo Bus&quot;.
&gt;It would help *me* a great deal if we could get a mapping of vehicle
&gt;names to people names...Does anybody else feel this way?

AARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! not the &quot;let's keep Joel busy&quot;
thread again!!!!

&gt;NuBus - '82 Diesel
&gt;p.s. NuBus got its name to differentiate it from the &quot;old bus&quot; which
&gt;    was a '76. NuBus is actually a nickname.  The proper name is:
&gt;    &quot;NuBusNuBusNuBus&quot;.  She was named before I got her. Don't blame me.
&gt;P.P.S. I engendered NuBus as a &quot;she&quot; because like my wife, NuBus gives
&gt;       me trouble and costs me a great deal of money... (but I love them both)

are you sure it's not &quot;N U Bus&quot;?? as with &quot;N U Endo?? :)

do you people realize how much Kludging i'll have to do to keep up with all
these busnames?? do ya, huh?? and how much bigger that'll make my poor wimpy
little ascii flat-file &quot;database&quot; what uses crappy ibm Nicknames files??

oh, sure, YOU don't care about MY problems!!!! it's only diskspace, after all,
right!!! :)
