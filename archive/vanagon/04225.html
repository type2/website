Subject: lighting the fridge


Some observations on fridge lighting...

	I have taken my fridge out 2X, cleaned everything (including
	combustion chamber), and made sure of all electrical connections.
	Can't say that it worked any better after.

	I have given up on looking for the pilot light through the little
	window in the fridge. I look for the green LED (below the water
	level LEDs, has an * beside it) to begin to glow.

	The fridge WILL light after 10 or so pumps and a couple of
	clicks, the LED gets brighter, and I stop pushing the button
	after a count of 15.

	Sometimes the bugger doesn't light right away, so I pump some
	more and blow air through the drain at the bottom. Sometimes
	I get a &quot;whump&quot;, when I have kept the safety button depressed
	for a few seconds without activating the sparker.

	My unsolved problem is that my fridge doesn't cycle, so I
	have it on max all the time. On a cold night, the fridge is
	off in the morning (I guess it got cold enough inside), and
	I have to relight it. No great problem, and on max, the unit
	reelly works well, supplying teeny icecubes for G&amp;Ts.

	Alistair
