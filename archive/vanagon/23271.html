Subject: Re: Advice on heads for '80 Westy

&gt;
&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I need advice on where to buy a head (preferrably new,
&gt; reputable rebuilt OK) for an '80 vanagon (air cooled,
&gt;2 litters, square ports).  The valve seat on # 3 dropped,
&gt; trashing the head and putting a big dent on the piston.
&gt;Should I replace the piston too? In that case, any suggestions
&gt;for places to buy a piston/ring set?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for all suggestions.
&gt;

Mario,

Here's my standard reply for dropped seats from Type IV air-cooled heads:

The 2.0 liter Type IV engine, used in 72-82 VW buses, VW Type IV cars, as
well as the Porsche 914, is by far the best air-cooled engine ever built by
VW.  The major problem with this engine is that sometimes the valve seats
come loose from the heads.  Bad!  Someone came up with a fix for this
problem.  See June 1995 Hot VWs mag, Page 52, &quot;Type 4 Head Rebuilding,&quot;
featuring head work done by:

Mark Stephens High Performance
21800 Oak Summit Ct
Tehachapi CA  93561
805-822-5678  Fax: 805-822-0223

Stephens does head rebuilding for some of the major parts resellers in the
nation and understand Type IV engines better, probably, than anyone else in
the biz.

Some of the tricks Stephens does in rebuilding Type IV heads are heating the
heads to 350 degrees F in an oven and freezing Stephens specially-designed
valve seats.  Then they drive the seats into the heads, followed by
&quot;pinching&quot; the aluminum around the seats, to keep the seats where they
belong, with a curved cold chisel and grinding everything smooth again. 

I recently had my '79 Bus engine rebuilt by Stephens and, while a little 
pricey (they used only German parts and made a slight mod to the combustion 
chamber), they did a first-class job.  You can  have displacement increased 
to 2.5 liters or more, install a hot cam, stroke it, etc. or leave it
completely stock.  The bottom end of a Type IV engine is virtually
bullet-proof, if it hasn't been allowed to overheat and had the oil and
filter changed regularly.

You might want to, while you're at it, reduce the compression ratio a little
so the engine will run well on 86 octane gas (it's a lot cheaper over the
years).  You can do that either with cylinder shims (the cheap way) or have
Stephens &quot;unshroud&quot; the combustion chamber (heads).

Best of Luck,


Cheese

P.S.  Mario,

Sorry i couldn't send you a more personalized reply; I need to be packing for 
my Colorado fly fishing expedition tomorrow at 0700 hours, sharp.  BTW,
loved playing your &amp; your brothers game.
