Subject: Re: CB Performance fuel injection


        There's one thing that I find puzzling about their injection
system:  how does it determine the quantity of air entering the engine?
The Bosch systems that I've read about (D, J, L &amp; K) all have some sort of
device which measures the incoming air directly (e.g. air mass sensor) or
indirectly (e.g. manifold pressure sensor).  Does the CB system just make
an estimation via the throttle position &amp; rpm?  Is this adequate?  Is this
why the low- and high-speed mixture control knobs are included on the
control unit?
