I have a 1600 because a PO had one put in while s/he was in Mexico.

So do I look for a 2.0L in  junk yard and have it rebuilt, do I look 
for a new one (Is there such a thing)?=20

What am I looking at as far as money goes and What can I sell the 1600 
for? I have the paper work from when it was put in Mexico. I'll post 
some info on that later, because I have questions about it.

Thanks for all your help.

I have to ask why you have a 1600 in a late bus?  It will not go up 
hill
fast.  Needs diffrent gearing to push the wieght of that beast.  Also, 
if the
performance was satisfactiry(you have a lot of patience), long drives 
at high
speeds will regularly melt the pistons and heads. Save your money and 
repalce
the 2.0L with the FI and all it's equipment including the EGR.
