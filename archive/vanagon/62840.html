Subject: inverter exchange program PC300

The message below worked for me and the new inverter they sent me runs my
drills and all kinds of stuff. The original PC300 I bought wouldn't run
those loads. So if you purchased A PC300XT send it in for the upgrade
replacement.

Enclosed is a PC300XT inverter for exchange for a PC300HS inverter. Enclosed
also is a check for $9.95 for shipping and handling, as I was instructed to
provide by your office. Also enclosed is my sales receipt.

You asked me on the telephone to include an explanation so here it is: This
inverter shuts itself off in less than an hour no matter how small a load
was being drawn from it=97even a 20 watt load that I use for a sound=
 machine.
I know the problem is in the design of the PC300XT itself, since I purchased
two and they both have the same problem. For this reason, I am taking your
suggestion to send it back and exchange it for the PC300HS, which,
presumably, will not have this problem.

As you can see on the attached receipt, I purchased two PC300XTs. I have
already exchanged one of these for the PC300HS about a month ago. I am
enclosing the other one so I can have it changed too.

							Sincerely,=20
