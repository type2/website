Subject: RE: towing boat (fwd)

Speaking of losing traction, I have an interesting story, but not
related to boat launching -- well, maybe it could be...

Delivering a pizza last night, I pulled up to the top of a steep
driveway -- not too steep, prolly about like a boat ramp.  This is a '78
by the way.  Backing down the driveway, I went to push on the brakes to
slow my d3sescent and the right fron twheel locked up.  Ack!  Didn't
slow me down much and left a nice black mark all the way down the
driveway accompianied with a loud screech.  Oops!  Seems busses need a
bit more weight on the front wheels for that.  So I ugess if you were
backing a boat in with a Vanagon and you tried to stop and the same
happened to you, you could either slam on the parking brake real
queick and holpe for traction or you could swim out of you r
Van.agon.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Another solution to avoid dunking the engine is to mount a second trailer 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; hitch on the front.  You get the idea.  A side benefit might be the ease
&gt; &gt;&gt; that you can maneuver a trailer this way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would be worried about backing the Vanagon up the ramp.  I would think it
&gt; &gt;would be much more likely to lose traction.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, and I'll marry Cindy Crawford.
&gt; 
&gt; Do FWD cars backing a trailer into the water, have this problem? If not,
&gt; why would a vanagon &quot;fronting&quot; a trailer into the water, have the problem?

&gt; P.S. No, that's *not* a Vanagon with schnorkel, and boat on trailer.
