Subject:       Joel, change the stats my friend!

Yes, Cousin Mike found another bus worthy to join alongside his 
Deluxe.

I just got off the phone with a fellow in the next town over, and 
tonight I drop off the check to pick up my new '59 Singlecab!  
Woo-hoo!

I saw it last night and was very impressed.  It's been in a garage 
for the last 10 years and has been a restoration project of a fellow 
in Idaho.  He wanted to fix it up but never had the time, and bailed 
on it.  A local guy went and bought it from him and is selling it to 
me for $50 extra, that being a total of $650.

It has a fried 36hp in it, but I have a 1600dp lined up already to go 
in as soon as the guy gets his 2020 finished.  The paint is the 
origianl reddish colored (not sealing wax) but more red.

I have a set of original fluted bumpers located.  The proper rear 
bumper (with the real square corners) even!  But that's and extra $300 
I'm unsure about.

Right now I plan to throw a few hundred in to it to get it on the 
streets, then I'll think about paint.  If so, I'll definately do 
Thom's sea foam green / forest green color combo.  Sharp!

Even though my collection pales in comparison to some:

'59 Singlecab
'57 23-Window Microbus Deluxe
