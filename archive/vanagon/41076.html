&gt; 
&gt; Salesman. (his territory covers Miami to New Orleans to Raleigh/Durham)
&gt; 
&gt; High-mileage driver (55K+ per year)
&gt; 
&gt; Non-mechanic. (shade tree or otherwise)

&gt; His car needs include the ability to go long distances reliably, be
&gt; comfortable to drive long distances, must be air conditioned, std trans,
&gt; good gas mileage, and the ability to pack the thing with a large amount of
&gt; high bulk/low weight......

Steve,

The only contribution I can make is to relate my observations that here in 
Orange I see a lot of new 'Eurovans' (although we don't call them that 
here in Oz, their just VW vans or Caravelles, although I don't see many 
Caravelles) which have travelled the 300 miles from Sydney on 
sales/delivery runs. Many keep going further west.

All highway traffic goes through the centre of town and I'm only out 
coming and going from work and during lunch.

The VWs certainly get away from the traffic lights quickly enough and 
there appear to be more of them than Japanese vans. The drivers look very 
comfortable sitting up high above the traffic.

(Flawed) Conclusion: VW vans are quick, travel well over longish 
distances and the drivers are comfortable.
