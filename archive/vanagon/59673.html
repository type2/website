&gt;Came from the front end (pass. side) when I hit a small bump going into a 
&gt;parking lot last night.
&gt;What broke is a short (10 in.) S-shaped vertical rod in front of the coil 
&gt;spring....doesn't seem to be a part of the primary suspension, no is the 
&gt;steering affected. I'm guessing the thing it attaches to at the top is a sway 
&gt;bar, and who knows what the thing at the bottom is. It sheared right where it 
&gt;goes into the lower bushing, at the point where it necks down to a 3/8 bolt. 
&gt;I didn't hit anything hard; from the looks of it corrosion has done it's work

&gt;1. What is this thing called and what does it do?

How about connecting rod? Connect the sway bar to the lower A-arm.

&gt;2. Is it still safe to drive for a couple of days? (And if not, why?)

Couple of days should be fine, but beware that your alignment may change:

a/ Because the broken end bangs (with the weight of the vehicle) on the
lower A-arm.

b/ No tension from the sway bar means that loose A-arm bushings and
ball joints arent kept in the same position. (This also gives
more clunk when driving)

Some people never fix it but then I would recommend to take off the
broken link, and have the alignment checked.

&gt;3. Does anyone have a mail-order source for these?

Somebody on the list (Bob Hufford I think) told me he has an extra one
he may be willing to part with. Otherwise check usual sources
(Kyle Wade, Ron Salmon, Bus Boys, Parts place...)

As an alternative you can fix it. Flatten the broken top and drill
and thread a hole for a bolt. For details see:

&gt;4. Are there any tricks to replacing them? (Looks fairly easy, but that's when&gt;I usually get caught)

Again for pictures and tricks see:
