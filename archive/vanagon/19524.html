Subject: Re:a racial issue??????



&gt; 
&gt; 	No one is trying to make a racial
&gt; 	issue out of it except for you.  Get a life!
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to be counted as someone else who suspects that
&gt; there is a racial element to the story. The description of
&gt; feeling righteous while vandalizing someone's car made me
&gt; very uncomfortable.
&gt; 
&gt; In tight parking spaces it is often unavoidable that a door
&gt; touches the adjoining car. I have gotten and given a few accidental
&gt; paint smudges over the years. In no way can I equate accidental
&gt; rubbing of paint with deliberate gouging of the side of someone's
&gt; car with a hunting knife.
&gt; 
&gt; The subtext of the story seemed to me to be one of &quot;getting
&gt; even with a black person with a bad attitude&quot;. That, to me,
&gt; is a racial issue.

	Please gentlemen, what is this ? trying to find a racial issue

	when there is none ? Please Remember that we all subscribed here
