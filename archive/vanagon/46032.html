&gt; This is a little poll on Vanagon mileage.  My newly-acquired '82,

&gt; alltime high of 11.5 mpg this last week, up from 10.5.  The increase is
&gt; attributed to boosting the tire pressure to 50psi all 'round (up about 14
&gt; psi).  Virtually all my driving is in 1st-2nd-3rd gear in typical urban,
&gt; stop-and-go traffic (in San Francisco, which also has a hill or two).  I
&gt; understand that 10-11 mpg is not unreasonable under these conditions,
&gt; even as tears well in my eyes at the modest numbers.  I have not had it
&gt; on the freeway enough to get any highway figures. I've been using 87
&gt; octane gas. How are the rest of you doing in the mileage catetory?

Ive been getting 15~18 mpg in mixed city/freeway driving in my 82 westy down
here in San Diego, and have been getting that for 133k miles (you can make it up a hill in 
second gear?).
