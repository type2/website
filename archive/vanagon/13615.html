Subject: 23 Window prices

&gt;There was another `58 23-window for about 1,000 bucks here.

The talk of prices for 23 window splits in the States has me *absolutely*
salivating.  Can you in fact, pick up a 23 window for less than $1000 US?  I
wouldn't care if it was engineless/transmission less - it is the bodies which
are hardest to come by in AUS.  The majority of early vans imported into this
country were Standard models.

Speaking of bodies, the body would have to be reasonably rust free (because
of the cost of importing replacement panels/ sections from the US, unless any
such bits came over with the vehicle I guess...).

Then there's shipping (no duty on importing cars over 30 years old here
though)...but still....I wonder if I could land one in country for around
$2000? 

On the other side of the coin, 50s bugs are fairly common and fairly cheap
here.    I could get hold of basically sound cars for around $300 - $1000....
all that's required (in terms of parts) for a LHD conversion is a LH pittman
arm......don't know about any administrative hassles involved in getting such
a vehicle back on the road in the US though.....

Or is reading this list driving me mad and have me lusting after the
impossible?
