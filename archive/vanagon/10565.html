&gt;  If we all make it to the next camp out, you can revel in orange plaid and
&gt;  childhood memories to your hearts content in my '74. Personally, if I had
&gt;  been buying it new, I would have gone for the green.

I hope you don't mean the uglyyy yellowish green (chartreuse), that VWoA
calls Yosemite Yellow? The day I get around to fixing that Missouri rust
(after having moved to a more VW-phile climate), I'll have it painted RED,
like a Ferrari. 

Those '70s color choices at VW were just an abomination.
