&gt; 1. &quot;correct&quot; engine lid for 1965 van (does anyone know what years of engine

&gt; those ;)

The correct one for your year will have the lip over the license plate
light and a church key hole.  And engine lid from '55 1/2 to '67 _will_
fit, provided you have the correct _apron_ for the lid.  But you want
the one that is correct for your bus...

There are 2 styles of aprons.  (splits only here)

The earlyones have a &quot;notch&quot; in the middle,t hat is actually offset slightly,
and a metal tab brazed on for the latch.  I think these go up to '65
The engine lids that go with these come in 3 flavors:
1 - the center brakelight ones with the (duh) center brakelight mounted on a 
flat panel above the license plate - up to '56, although I've seen some
'57s that claim that they were factory.  The clue to whether or not a
center brakelight is &quot;correct&quot; (not you Michael, just in general) is 2 sets
of wires coming out of the loom at the top/rear/center of the engine compartment
instead of just one.  The one set is for the licenseplate light, the second is
for the brake light.  There will also NOT be a brake light circuit in the
two tail lights.  This means you should also have &quot;bubble&quot; tail lights.  The
'57s that claimed to have center brakelights also had brake circuits on
the sides, which to me proves they don't know what they are talking about...

2 - same as above with no light, but with a flat panel where the light 
shoulda been.

3 - has a lip (and thus not a flat panel) above the license plate light.

all three of these have the church key latch

the later aprons have no notch, and have a screw-on tab to catch the latch
The engine lids for them have the lip, and a larger, more sqare hole for
the latch.
