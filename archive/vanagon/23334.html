Subject: Re: RE:Driver's Side Barndoor

&gt;Joe Fournier say's he's spotted a van with a Barndoor on the driver's side
&gt;and asks how rare it is...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;First off &quot;barndoor&quot; is a specialized term which refers to pre-56(?)
&gt;Type2s which had a large engine lid cover which essentially was about
&gt;double the size of the later engine lids. In that engine compartment
&gt;was the spare tire as well as the fuel tank.

Sorry about the possible misuse of terminology (like I said, I'm not yet
familiar with the breed).

&gt;
&gt;As to the doors on the driver's side...what you saw were the &quot;cargo
&gt;doors&quot; which all early Typ2 vans had (both passenger and cargo versions..
&gt;with the exception of a handful of 66 &amp; 67 vans which had sliding doors
&gt;by special order). Chances are what you did see was a double-door
&gt;delivery van which had the cargo doors on BOTH sides of the van. Those
&gt;are rare...and were available from VW by special order.

Could be. I didn't see the other side, but I'll check next time I go by. I
think it probably belongs to a student here, as the semester is just
starting and it was near campus.

&gt;
&gt;If it did have only one set of cargo doors on the driver's side, either
&gt;it was a RHD van (RHD vans had the cargo doors on the left side of
&gt;the van) or in fact LHD van. If it was LHD, then it is probably as
&gt;rare as the double-door vans...this too was only available by special
&gt;order.

I'll try to keep you all updated.

Thanks! Joe
