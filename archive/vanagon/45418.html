Reminds me of trying to start my sister's Cavalier back home in Minnesota on a -25 day in the dead 
of winter - I was spraying ether or something in the carb and trying to start it, after all else had 
failed. Well, it started - and 4-foot flames shot out of the engine! After a few minutes they died 
down, but the engine was a blackened mess - still, it started, and ran fine ever since. Go figure.
