To all,

        I am stuck with the problem on both the drivers and passengers door
that if the door is locked and you pull the trigger (for lack of a better word)
to open the door you can no longer unlock the door with a key. This of course
must be the best part of owning a walk through bus since I have to go in
through the sliding door. I have not pulled off the door panels yet but, it
seems strange that both sides work likes this! Has anyone seen this or know of
the fix?

        I Sayeth: Verily, I doth also have thine problem. My solution is to
not pull the trigger when locked... ;-)  Ok, on mine, if I blow it and try
to open it locked, the lock will disengage after a little back-and-forth
jiggling. Kind of annoying, but I haven't bothered with it too much-more
serious things to deal with, like running warm...   :-(

Peace,
