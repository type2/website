Subject: Re: 86 Vanagon start problem


&gt;Anyone venture an explanation? The starter is old and draws too many amps?
&gt;The compression is so wonderful that when the engine is warm its 
&gt;difficult to crank over? The timing needs to be reset? Sun spots?
&gt;
&gt;The van runs incredibly well once its started. 21+ mpg. 

&gt;The van has never failed to start for us, but seems as though it may at 
&gt;any time...
&gt;


Hey... I've got this problem too! (on an '85 ) It only happens when the van 
is partly warmed up. Such as when shutting off then starting after less than 
10 minutes, or starting up again after an hour or so following a run. I put 
it down to damage done to the barrels/pistons during the slow (900 mile 
trip) demise of my water pump. Just the right amount of heat and things bind 
up?. Starter cables etc are clean and tight, battery OK, but not new.   Any 
advice welcome, thanks   tjs  
      (ps. that mileage figure is the same for me, at 65-70 mph, anyone 
getting consistently better? )
