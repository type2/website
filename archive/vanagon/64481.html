Subject:      Awning supported by jack brackets?

----------
&gt; &gt; Anyone know of a manufacturer of a good awning for an '85 Vanagon?
&gt; &gt;

&gt;
&gt; Only real question to date has been whether to mount the support strut
&gt; clips to the Vanagon body (requiring 4 holes to be drilled!!) or continue
&gt; securing the support struts to the van wheels (using an elastic shock
cord
&gt; device I made), which limits the extension of the awning somewhat.  Any
&gt; feedback from other Vanagon awning owners would be appreciated.


Thanks Wes.

I thought I read about somewhere there was an awning specifically designed
for Vanagons that used the jack brackets for supports.

Ever heard of one?
