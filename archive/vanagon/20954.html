Subject: Re: Sqirting water on an oil cooler et al
Date: Mon, 17 Jul 95 18:06:23 EDT

When the air is &quot;thick and around 68 degrees&quot; - this is when the
air-cooled engines
run their best - especially at dusk on a cool summer's eve, just after a
rain storm has passed through...maybe this relates to other factors as well. 

Squirting the radiator or oil cooler can't be that much different than
driving through a very very very thick fog, or maybe the Bavarian Alps?
So why would putting dense moisture on a hot surface make that
device less capable of radiating heat?

Apropos the water injector system - on Westys you could use the water pump
with a second line going under the car.....or why not put a water jacket
around the oil cooler?
