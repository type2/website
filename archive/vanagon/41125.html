Subject: FS: 1970 Westfalia - Phoenix

I'm posting this for my nephew, who lives in Phoenix. This is my old bus. 
I bought it from the original owner (my former next-door neighbor) who
went to Germany and watched it roll off the assembly line. I drove it for
many years...then foolishly sold it to my brother-in-law...who then gave
it to his son...who has taken good care of it but now needs some money for
college. It's a much nicer bus than mine, but I'm in the middle of 
painting AquaVan and couldn't raise the money to buy it back right now.

As far as I know, no serious work was ever done on this bus by less than
the best professional available. It's never been in a real wreck (I once
bumped a parked car and dinged the wheel well and I think somebody backed
into it-parked-since Danny's had it) and it's never had any serious
rust...nothing past minor surface rust that was soon repaired. 

I haven't seen the bus since 1990, but I've seen pictures and it looked
good. If you're looking for a really nice westy, this could be it. Except
for me, this bus has always been owned by neat-freaks, including my
nephew. 

Thanks! Joe
