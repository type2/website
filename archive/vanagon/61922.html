Hi!

First, I luv my bus.  85 Vanagon, brown, well loved.

Anyway, we just got back from doing the Yellowstone-Teton loop, and I realized something.  My speakers and radio need updating!

Problem:  I don't want to have to replace the grills up front, or the pods out back if I don't have to....so my question is:

Does anyone know of a decent speaker set for installation in the old hanging pods in back, and the grill door speaks up front?

Thanks, if y'all can help!
