&gt;How much will this sunuvagun end up costing me to get fixed?  I trust 
&gt;it is major work. 

You can replace them yourself.

You can:

A) take the heads off and put new tubes in.
B) take out pushrods and put in two-piece tubes (and then put pushrods back in

I did &quot;B&quot; on my 911 (alas sans pushrods its a DOHC engine with excellent 
results and saved me a pile of $$$$
