So Martha Rubin says:

&gt; 
&gt; So Steve, where's the next installment of your trip report, huh?  Do
&gt; you think you can just leave addicts hanging like that?   :)

Well... Since you were ribbing me about getting it done this week, I
figured it might have fizzled.  Oh well, don't worry, the next installment
is close to done except each time I try to finish these they get to 
long and I have to do a &quot;to be continued...&quot;  :(   ;)  

Well this ever end?  ;)
