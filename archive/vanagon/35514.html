Subject: 1962 Brake job update

Well, 

The parts arrived yesterday (most expensive lumps of steel
I've ever seen).

I spent the day cleaning the hubs &amp; brake lines &amp; nutsnbolts
while Damon sat in his '73 Dormobile drinkin' tea and smokin'
fags (that's a cigarette before any of you start questioning 
his sexuality!!) and offering the odd pearl of wisdom from his
point of vantage. (while I grovelled in the grease)

The process is still as slow as ever for me, but how much nicer
to be working with new clean parts! The front cylinders, adjusters
and brake lines are assembled. Tomorrow: the dreaded shoes.
Please let them be easier to put on than they were to
take off.

Any additional pearls of wisdom appropriate to this stage in the
proceedings would be gratefully received (although it looks
to be pretty straightforward [famous last works]).
