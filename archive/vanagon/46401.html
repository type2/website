Subject: Breaking up is hard to do...Re: Go with the split

Over the last couple of years of Vanagon list activity I've gained a strong
&gt;impression that the typical owner of a water-cooled VW van is not only less
&gt;mechanically adept than air-cooled owners, they seen less willing to acquire
&gt;the skills and invest in the tools that would keep their orphaned vehicles
&gt;alive, a failure of spirit -- or Fear of Grease -- that virtually assures
&gt;such machines will end up on the junk heap.


Now now, let's make this split as painless as possible.

It has just dawned on me that I replied to an individual when I meant to
reply to the list, sorry about that whoever you were!

Here's what I said to him...

It is sad that we must split.  I agree that schism(I use this word for ALL
its religous connotations, b/c to me Maggie is a religious experience...)
is painful, but all in all I think a good idea.  But I totally lament the
idea that some of the fold will be separate from us.  So I propose THREE
lists.  One each for technical discussion air and water cooled, and one
list for the general celebration of our beloved transporters, regardless of
their age or temperature control...

Of course, I don't have any clue as to the mechanics involved in setting up
yet another list, I suppose this in a way makes me hypocritical.  But I'm
just trying to make the inevitable bearable, even good.

All things must pass.
