Subject: draining the coolant?

Hello-

I need to replace a heating hose, which I assume means I have to drain and
refill the entire cooling system. I have the phosphate free anti-freeze. Any
advice will be greatly appreciated.

I found some detailed info on draining the system somewhere on the internet
or on the list a while ago but I can't remember where it was...any leads?

TIA
