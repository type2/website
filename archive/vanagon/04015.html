Ralf,
	No offense to you or Canada, but I think some of your above
reasons may be slightly exaggerated.  

&quot;my money doesn't go far&quot;

	Gas is cheaper here, no?

&quot;too many people&quot;

	True, in places like Southern and Central California.  However,
	the Northwest (Idaho, Wisconsin, etc.) is sparsely populated, for
	the most part.

&quot;no underexplored areas&quot;

	ummm... I could show you lots of them within 1,000 miles of your
	home.


Come on, Ralf, give the US another shot!  :)

-David
