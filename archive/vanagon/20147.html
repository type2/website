Subject: Vanagon engine number?


Dear list,

Some guy phoned me up yesterday as a mutal friend told him
I had some spare 1600 dp heads, which he thinks he needs to
replace his cracked ones. 

Now I haven't seen his '80 Vanagon, but apparently it has 'CT' 
stamped on the engine. Surely this means it is a type 4 (maybe 2 litre?)
motor. Or have I got it wrong? 

cheers
Marcus
'70 bus
