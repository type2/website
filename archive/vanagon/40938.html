Subject: 911 in 69 westy



YO&gt;Can I put a V-6 Porche 911 engine in a 69 westy?
YO&gt;If I can does it require any adaptions?
YO&gt;If the engine is too big to fit in the standard engine compartment how 
YO&gt;hard would it be to cut some of the sheetmetal surrounding the engine away?
YO&gt;Also what are the pros and cons of putting the engine in?

Hmmn, might be hard to put a V-6 Porche (extra fast and foreign
thing on the front of your house) engine in anything as Porsche
has never made a V-6 that I can recall unless the current 968?
has one but I think they are still pretty much making inline 4's
flat 6's and V 8's, hmmn maybe he want to cut a few cylinders
off a 928 mill.

Sorry feeling like a real $*#hole today. Course what's new.
