Subject: Can you make the bus quiet?

After removing all the &quot;stuff&quot; out of my bus so I can begin restoration
I've noticed how noisy it is.  The engine sounds VERY LOUD.  The only 
thing I have in the back is the folding bench seat and rear cushion.  I 
removed the side cabinet(floor to ceiling) as I want this to be a passenger
vehicle.  The floor is rubber mat.  My headliner is good.  All the side
panels are intact. Are there any kits to soundproof the engine compartment?
What has worked for you?

Martin
