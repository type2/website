Subject: Tire chains

Whether necessary or not, &quot;Chains Required&quot;  signs are often posted on snow
covered highways in Calif.
So, I need to acquire chains for my &quot;new&quot; 2wd '87 Vanagon with the 205/70 MXL
tires on steel wheels.  I noticed that the Owners Manual said that there is
insufficient clearance in the wheel wells for chains when the 205/70 tires
are fitted.
Has anyone tried this?  What about cable chains vs. regular chains?  Any
suggestions appreciated!
