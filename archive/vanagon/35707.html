Subject: Red Light On - '75

Alright, I think I know what I'm in for, but there's the story anyway. I'll
try to keep it short.

This weekend I tuned the bus,  Normal in every way, *except* - when I turned
the engine to get TDC I discovered the alternator was flopping around loose!!
 I don't know how I could have driven 20 miles or more with no red light!  So
anyway, I tightened the fan belt and proceeded.  Next night, piled a couple
of friends in and took off to pick up a third.  On the way out the driveway,
the headlights blinked once, blinked again, then RED LIGHT ON!

I shut down and jumped out with my flashlight, thinking the fan belt had
broken, and checked the rear.  Belt is fine.  Alternator isn't moving around.
Battery connections tight and clean.  Everything looks normal, no unusual
smells.  So I continued home (20+ miles) because I had to...  headlights
never dimmed; I had to use the wipers a few times 'cause it was *storming*
out there, but we shut off radio and interior lights.

Next morning (still pouring rain), I checked everything again.  A friend
checked the battery with a volt etc. meter which showed 12 volts in there.
Removed the voltage regulator, and he checked that too.  (Pardon me but I am
completely stupid about things electrical) - I think it measured at about 82
somethings.  Compared to a new one which read .5 somethings, and the volt
meter owner opined that the new one showed much more resistance, therefore
this was likely the problem.  So I replaced the voltage regulator.  Still Red
Light On.

My conclusion is that the alternator is fried, or just *maybe*, there's a
short somewhere...  the bus has started up fine four times since then, but I
know it's just a matter of time if the alternator is shot.  Battery,
alternator and regulator were newly replaced last winter after the floods, so
this *shouldn't* be happening.

Two questions:  Could I have tightened the fan belt _too_ tight, and what are
the consequences?  And since I had been doing the tuneup between heavy
downpours, perhaps some water got in where it shouldn't be and caused a short
somewhere... Opinions?

TIA,
Ruthie
