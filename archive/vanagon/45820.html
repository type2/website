Subject:       Opinions on WCM products?

Howdy all,

I'm about to put out the $400 or so I need to get new vinyl seat 
covers and pads, and a sunroof for my Deluxe, and the singlecab.

Anyone had good/bad experiences with West Coast Metric?  Not so much 
the service aspect as the quality of the repros.  What other options 
(other vendors) are there for vinyl seat repros, and door panel 
repros?

I do realize the door repros are not correct for a late 50's model, 
but I want something that looks nice.

Any opinions are welcome!
