Subject: Re:  Trouble after rebuild

&gt;From: Steve Johnson &lt;sjohnson_at_pcocd2.intel_dot_com&gt;:
&gt;Well...this could be a number of things.  Who did this rebuild for you?

I did.  :-(

I'll take it back to the shop that did the align-bore and see what they
think.  Near as I can tell, the sound is from the case, toward the rear.
Definitely not fan or anything near the heads.  I'll take a stethoscope
to it tomorrow.  I checked for scraping tin, that's not it.
