&lt;&lt;  Hi all:  Are Eberspacher gas heaters the only ones found on Vanagons
 from the factory? I have come into possession of a complete Gas heater
 from a aircooled Vanagon. It is flat and apears to be made of stainless.
 I have never seen one before and am not sure what kind it is.

Todd, if you were REALLY lucky , you're Tri Star woulda come with a Webasto
BBW 46, a gas heater that actually HEATS THE COOLANT!!!!  instead of the air.
This was found on many Canadian syncros. 

But, yes, if the gas heater you found on a aircooled Vanagon was the kind
that was mounted under the center of the floor, and looks like &quot;a big
muffler&quot; then it's a Eberspacher BA6.
