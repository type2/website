&gt;&gt;&gt;My fuel pump started howling and humming today.  I called a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;parts places (the dealers were already closed).  $149 (on sale!) and
&gt;&gt;&gt;$199.  Can anyone tell me what the dealer price might be or if these are
&gt;&gt;&gt;the same prices others are seeing around the country.
&gt;&gt;

My 77' Volvo 264 had a howling/humming fuel pump from the 1st day I bought
it (used). It's been there for some 5-6 years and still howling/humming and
WORKING. I finally took a trip to my local junkyard pulled one from a deserted
Volvo. It costed me $16. I thought for that much I do not have much to lose.
It is quiet and works fine. I am wondering if this (Bosch) pump is the same
as the one on Vanagon. They look about the same size/shape. I think there is 
plenty of Volvo in junkyard but not vanagon.
