&gt;Just something that made me smile today.
&gt;Saw it on the back of a splittie.

&gt;I've had one on the single cab for years. It really works to keep
tailgaters away. It cracks me up to see the frustrated faces doing 75mph to
try to pass me when I'm doing 65+ with my 3.88 ring and pinion freeway flyer
tranny. I'm on the second sticker. I removed the sticker to test my tail
gate theory. It was a informal, non-inferential statistical survey of
tailgating blondes in red sports cars. With the sticker off, I was tailgated
without mercy and got the finger twenty two times. When I replaced the
sticker I recieved the same &quot;jail house howdy&quot; only twenty one times but the
drivers just about lost bladder control as they attempted to peel around me.
Its my theory that the sticker reduces tailgating! (Cool)
