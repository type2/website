Subject: Re: Wanna 90-91 syncro westy 

&gt; The search continues....hopefully in the northwest.  A poptop syncro with 
&gt; air, diff lock, lo miles, perfect condition...you know...the dream mobile.
&gt; Thanks so far to those who've offered encouragement and assists.

At the risk of sounding/being really dense...

What is a synchro??

Thanks in advance.

Robb
