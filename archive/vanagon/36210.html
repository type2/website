Subject: re: Gas smell

&gt;concerns me alittle is the owner says that when the tank is full he
&gt;can
smell
&gt;
&gt;gas. When the tank gets off of full it goes away.  He said that there
&gt;was a &quot;T&quot; fitting on top of the tank that needs repalcing. I am going
&gt;through the Bently book right now to see what I can see.  Any one
&gt;have any Ideas on this??
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

There are  two tee fittings up there. They like to break.  Have to
drop tank or have very small hands and long arms.  Not a fun job. 
Also make sure harness and dirt not touching tank.  That combo wears
through the tank from vibration. Dennis.

Just read an in depth procedure on removing the gas tank
on the Funkengrooven www site, back issues section. 

Don't recall the exact URL, but it should be listed here:

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
