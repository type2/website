Subject: Re:Spotted EV Camper in Key West

When I was camping inthe Keys I saw a white EV Camper.  it had all of the
exterior hookups and had a real nice gray granite looking cabnit, sink,etc.
Does anyone know if they are going to produce any more EV Westfalias.  I am
thinking about either selling my 89 Westy or trading it in on a new one
later on.
