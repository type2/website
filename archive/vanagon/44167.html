Subject: Re: FS:  Bentley Bus &amp; Vanagon Manuals



&gt;I think I can offer list members pricing that is competitive with 
&gt;the lowest prices I've seen mentioned - but, without the inflated 
&gt;&quot;shipping &amp; handling&quot; charges tacked on by JC Whitney, et al.  
&gt;Also, no sales tax if shipped outside of Pa. 
&gt;
&gt;Prices are:
&gt;$66 for the Vanagon Factory Service manual, and 
&gt;$33 for the '68-79 Bus Factory Service manual.
&gt;Shipping would be $2.75 to the east coast and $4.50 to the west.
&gt;Usually shipped within 48-72 hours.
&gt;

A few people e-mailed me today regarding the availability of 
split-window or Eurovan/Winnie manuals.  Splittie bus manuals 
('63-67) are available at $69 plus shipping.  Sorry, can't get 
the EV manual yet :(
