&gt; &gt;   Are these reserve valves easy to come by? If the valve is mounted on the 
&gt; &gt;   tank, all the flexible hose in the whole system could be changed without
&gt; &gt;   draining the tank! I like this idea.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; They should be.  All the pre-gas guage busses have them.  This thing goes
&gt; &gt; in where the little fuel tap (that screws onto the bottom of the tank) goes.
&gt; 
&gt; Are we sure about this, how about on bays?, seems the two taps
&gt; on my injected '76 were welded/braded in the tank, as were on
&gt; a carbed '74 parts Bus I had (only 1 tap though).  I have not
&gt; looked at my '71, have been avoiding the fuel lines (a stupid
&gt; idea admittedly) but really like the reserve valve idea if it
&gt; will work.

I had the fuel tank out of my '76 recently and has 2 tubes/nipples 
welded/braded to the bottom of the tank on the right side.
