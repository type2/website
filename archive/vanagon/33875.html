Subject: Re: time vs rpm vs wear


&gt;
&gt; How many of you drive 70mph?
&gt;
Aside frome engine wear, the thing to remember is that our vehicles are 
not even close to aerodynamic.  The faster we drive, the more gas we 
use.  Even a small increase in speed above 55-60 means MUCH more pedal 
travel.  Any money you lose due to premature wear on your engine from 
high speed driving is doubled when the cost of extra gas is added.  
Remember, drag is an exponential relation:  the difference between 20-30 
mph is quite a bit less than between 60-70mph(in terms of drag).  


I used to try and drive as fast as I could(within reason) when I first 
owned my bus. I was used to driving a car, and didn't worry too much 
about it.  Well, after the first gas bill came in, I quickly learned why 
I had always been passing all those buses before:)  I think I was getting 
something like 13 miles per gallon(at 70) which is what my old 68 Pontiac 
got with 3 times the engine.
