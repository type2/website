&lt;&lt; I'd like to add more seating to my 85 Westy using the vanagon
 bench seat recently put up for sale.  I've got a single seat that
 slides in on the floor rails which are full width.  Since I'm not
 located near enough to the vanagon bench seat to try it myself does
 anyone know if it will fit with the Westy stove, etc?

 Regards, &gt;&gt;

does your 85 westy have the floor rails?  The 2 person middle seat out of a 7
pass will fit in your westy but you cant open the fridge door with it in
there (just slide it to clear the door when you want access to the fridge)
