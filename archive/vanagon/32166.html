Subject: working under the dash (was/Re: Heaters(again))

I've wished that there was an easy way to detach the sheet metal from the front of the bus to be able to work on the stuff under the dash from the outside!!!

&gt;I figured it would be no problem.  Has anyone done this?  I spent about 3 
&gt;hours fighting the wires and linkages and NON-FLEXIBLE heater tubes and 
&gt;still couldn't do it.  I finally got the thing out, but knew there was no 
&gt;way in hell I could get it back in.  I'd already lost about a quart of 
&gt;blood from various cuts on my hands, and being 6'5&quot; I was all cramped up 
&gt;from laying between the seats.  I spent the money for one hours worth of 
&gt;labor and highly recommend that anyone else out there do the same.
