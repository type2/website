Subject: Does your '76-'79 fridge work?

After watching some of you guys beat your heads (or chests) to get your 
original battery fridge running, I'm curious if there are ANY out there 
that work.

I, personally, have never seen one operational and ripped mine out in
favor of extra storage space and a propane bench fridge behind the
passenger seat.....

So, does anyone have an operational fridge from a '76-'79 Westy?
