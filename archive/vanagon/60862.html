I recently saw a page that offers the &quot;glovebox&quot; manual you speak of, the
fridge maunal, and the overall Vanagon manual for about $10 each. 

Where was that, now?  Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think,
Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think, Think,
Think, Oh, Yeah...

You will find these at the &quot;Limbo&quot; Site, in &quot;The Store&quot;.

Enjoy!  Matthew, Fairfax, VA
