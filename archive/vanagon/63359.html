Subject:      Eurolights

Try getting hold of a VW dealer in Malaysia, Hong Kong or  Singapore
where these vans all come Euro H4 lamps.  Think the prices are fairly
reasonable, the dealer in Malaysia is Autodunia VW.  The Vanagon is
called a Transporter or Caravelle van. That's all I know.

Found a cataolg for a bolt on electric supercharger for the Vanagon for
$1300/-, improves power 25% - 30% and a whole cheaper the Subaru engine
conversion.
