Right on!

There has been another bill that has been kicked around for a few years that
would set up a system whereby you could trade in your pre-'82 vehicle
for a $2000 rebate towards a new car.  Yeah, right!  Like I'm going to 
sacrifice my '72 911 for $2k towards a piece of planned-obsolecens, time-
bombed 'merkin crap!  No F**K'n way!

I think its interesting how they rely on &quot;industry executives&quot; for advice
on how to clean up the environment. An the scientists?  Who?!  A GM
Market Analyst doesn't count as a scientist!!!

Cars need to be evaluated on an individual basis - I've seen a lot of
crappy little pintos and plymoths grinding down the road in a cloud of
black smoke.  The smog check (every 2 years here) is irrelevant, since
their registration is usually a couple of years out of date anyway!

Any why not start putting some pollution controls on diesel trucks?  We've
all seen the crap they put out!  And diesel exhaust is way worse than gas -
containing along with carbon monoxide and the witches brew of nasties in
addition to benzene, formaldehyde and some other warm fuzzy chemicals!
