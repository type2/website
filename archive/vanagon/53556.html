&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Did the road trip to Chicago from Philly and wiped out on the ice in
&gt; &gt;Indiana on X-Mas Eve. I slowly spun into the guard rail around South
&gt; &gt;Bend and whacked both my LF and LR sections of my bumpers.  I hit it
&gt; &gt;hard enough to rip off the front bumper and twist it into a pretzel, the
&gt; &gt;rear might bend back but it has a rip in it from the guard rail bolt.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I'm already getting a price from volks sport on new bumpers, but if
&gt; &gt;anyone has a parts van I could pick at it would sure help, email me
&gt; &gt;prices.

&gt; Hotch,
&gt; I'm about 45 min. from Philly (in Montgomery County), and I may have what
&gt; you need.  I assume these are the chrome bumpers, not the later style
&gt; plastic ones?  Do you still have the rubber impact strips and endcaps, or
&gt; do you need those, too?
&gt; -Ron
 Ron, 

Thanks, I was hoping you could help.  

They are chrome and I need the works, the rubber is still in South Bend
and the plastic broke.

Email me your phone #.
