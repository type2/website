Subject: Splittie 'Tipper'???

Hi All,

No, this has nothing to do with Tipper Gore!

Upon receiving my absolutely wonderful 1996 NEATO/Bulli-Kartei/SSVC 
Bimbo-less Calendar, I've become intrigued about the 'Tipper' Single Cab 
on the front cover.  Does anyone have any decent pics or scans of these 
elusive creatures?  Until now, I've never seen any nor heard of their 
existance.  Any info is welcome!

The pic on the calender hides the structural features of this setup so my 
curiousity is running rampant!!  8-)
