Subject: I Bought My Camper!

Howdy there
Yes, it's true, I have finally found my camper, and even right here within an
hour's drive! As a quick summary, I was searching for a split window camper to
replace my very rusty '67 hardtop camper. So, as usual, I was searching the
classifieds Monday, and came across &quot;67 Volks van, runs, $650.&quot; Needless to
say, I called first thing that evening, and found to my delight that it is a
walk-through, pop-top! I was thrilled, and we arranged for me to see it last
night. So, last night, a friend and I set out chasing the wild goose, and
arrived to find a *very* straight camper waiting. A small disappointment was
that it is not a Westy, but rather some American company I have never heard of.
However, it is very well done, and I figure I will put a Westy interior in it
when I get the chance.
 Anyway, as I said the body is super straight. the rocker under the cargo doors
is gone, but that's because 1 of the jalousies had been missing for the 14
years it sat. The driver's floor is also bad, because the vent window was open.
(Just a note-if you're storing a bus for long term, PLEASE shut the windows...)
However, the battery tray, corners, floors, and frame are all rust free! There
is some surface rust, but nothing bad at all.
  So, I'm going to redo the brakes, and tear down the engine to check it out.
It was supposedly freshly rebuilt before sitting for 14 years, so I'm hoping it
will clean up nicely. Other than that, the wiring is perfect, and the front end
is pretty tight.
  Anyway, I am just pleased as punch to have found this, and especially for a
good price. The down side, however, is that a couple other things must go...
So, if anyone needs a solid, running, rough-looking 65 single cab, we should
talk.
  Other than that, Have a wonderful day and enjoy your bus!
(Stickers should be here early next week...)
