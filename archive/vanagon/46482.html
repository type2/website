Subject: Grendel's cousin

Hi folks, 

I found this on the aircooled newsgroup.  Isn't this the guy who sold Bob 
Grendel?

&gt;I was cruising around in my beetle the other day, and saw a '63 parked 
&gt;under a tree, looked like it had been there for years. (7, to be exact.)
&gt;I contacted the original owner(!), and went to have a quick look; he
&gt;had removed the interior, so I noticed no (none!) rust anywhere-still 
&gt;had original motor, everything all original, down to the license
&gt;plates it was issued with! The price? $300.
&gt;  I went out there the next day to pull it out, pretty much assuming
&gt;that I was going to buy it; Opened the passenger door (only one with 
&gt;a handle), walked around inside, and then opened the driver's door-
&gt;AUUGH! the heater channel was rotted through! :( I could poke my
&gt;finger through it. Man, was I bummed! (I can do pretty much everything but
&gt;replace heater channels.) Yes, I looked at the other side really
&gt;closely, and from the ankleburner hole, I could see about a half an
&gt;inch of loose rust on the bottom of the channel-so both of them were
&gt;undoubtedly rotted out.
&gt;
&gt;Now, I get a call from my brother, who lives near Portland today-
&gt;he was talking to his neighbor, who happened to mention a &quot;hippie
&gt;bus&quot; that's been parked in the wood near there for about &quot;20 years
&gt;or so&quot;...so, a couple of weeks later, he finally decides to go look
&gt;at the bus-a pretty darn close to perfectly preserved '67 21-window!
&gt;(Small rusthole in the cargo area.), up on blocks for 15 years.
&gt;So, he asks the guy how much he wants...twenty dollars.(!!!) Needless
&gt;to say, my brother is now the proud owner of a '67 21-window.
&gt;
&gt;The bastard. :)
