Subject: Re: electric mirrors

&gt; I can hear a &quot;click&quot; each time I move the switch, though. 
&gt; I am sure I am not the first one with this problem... 

Definately not.  The passenger mirror on my '91 works fine but the drivers
side on has very limited range and gives me the clicking noise you
describe.  I too would be interested in hearing of possible fixes.
