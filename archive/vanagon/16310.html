Subject: Re: Squeaking from front end 

&gt;My vanagon is just about the noisiest animal

Mine too, '87 syncro, but '85 panel is silent (relatively). I've lubed every 
rubber bushing piece I can see/reach with white grease spray, helped quite a 
bit but not completely. I'm leaning towards it being the upper arm bushings 
which I can't soak with grease. Worst on whoopdie-do bumps, better now that 
weather is warmer. I test drove an '83/83 westy last week with similiar but 
less pronounced squeak. Try a drive without the spare tire? Mine squeaks 
louder with my wife in the passenger seat, but I've already been thumped for 
drawing any conclusions based on that fact. let me know if you fix it.  tim s.
