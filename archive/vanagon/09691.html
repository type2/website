&gt; &gt;Umm... along this vein, I'd like to know if anyone out there knows
&gt; &gt;if there's a good product out there to cover the front walk-thru

&gt; &gt;protect the carpet.  I'd like to get something down before it gets

&gt; my sister, cheap person that she is, got gawdawful cheap looking carpet
&gt; remnants and flung them down in her Biddy-mobile (as her kids call the
&gt; chrysler product) ... it does protect the original carpet, and is removeable

I just got some remnant carpet from the nearby church which was 
recarpeting. It does NOT have rubber backing and it stays in place just 
fine.  I cut it to fit the entire front in three pieces and then I made 
two big pieces for the back.  My plan is to replace it every year.  It 
wasn't really much work, and it'll sure save the existing carpeting.  
I've already replaced it once.  Above all, it's FREEE!
