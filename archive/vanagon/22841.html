Subject: Rear heater cores (wasser boxers)


Does anyone know if rad shops can fix a leaky rear heater core
for a vanagon?  I've got mine out and it's definately leaking 
from the core itself, not the screw.

Alternatively, does anyone know where to get a replacement?
Near Toronto?
I don't really want to deal with Hayman, but may have to...
I haven't asked the dealership for a price,  It'd be ridiculous.

TIA


Cheers
