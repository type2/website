&gt;In fact, the above reference is the ONLY reference listed in the index
&gt;other than the name in the title of the book by Dr. Jean Rosenbaum
&gt;
&gt;I also noted that while on the discussion of automobiles and the intrinsic
&gt;significance between the type of automobile we own and our sexual orientation
&gt;Dr. Jean only discusses Volkswagens, Convertibles, Station Wagons, Luxury
&gt;Cars and 4x4....Hmmm, Volkswagen is a type of car and not a brand...

Da Spouse gave me this book as a gag gift a while back,  and I thought it
was pretty bad, even for pop-psychology.  I don't recall the part about your
car=your sexual orientation.   Geez... I hope the VW is the appropriate
choice fer me... ;)
