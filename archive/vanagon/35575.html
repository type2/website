&gt; I was thinking about making the switch to 205's, looking for smoother ride,
&gt;more traction in mud &amp; snow.  And frankly, the westy looks like it's standing
&gt;on birdlegs on them skinny tires.

I don't think wider tires will give more traction on snow. On the
contrary: wider tires offer more surface for the snow to lift the vehicle
up from solid ground. Same as aquaplaning.

Ideally, I'd like a set of wide wheels for the summer, but keep the stock
wheels w/ 185ers for the winter.
