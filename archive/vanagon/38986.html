Subject: RE: Wretched Excess


&gt;I knew my original Wretched Excess post hadn't reached the whole list when
&gt;Steve didn't comment on it.

I got it, I got it.

Now I'm being criticized for NOT talking about big engines in VWs???  ;^)

Seriously, it sounds like a real hoot, Bill. I'm not much into racing,
and the V6anagon has plenty enough power for me. I'm on the Fordnatics
list too, 'cause of my '66 Mustang. Most of the people there talk strictly
about racing, power mods, etc. I find it boring, personally. But they
HAVE helped me a lot when I was doing suspension repairs to the 'stang.

The V6anagon keeps up with &quot;normal&quot; traffic well, which my '71 and '69
never did. The only advantage a V8 would have IMHO is for drag racing,
which I'll pass on. Don't pay too much attention to the Steve-and-his-
big-engine talk on this list-- notice that it came from everyone *except*
me. One list member called it right-- they're just jealous.   :^)
