You could always talk your grandmother into making them.  She'd probably 
have fun at it.

VanBondo suggests:
After watching Mrs. Vanbondo make the curtains for the '67RFH camper I
suspect that if Ol' Gramma is as wise as she looks she should charge a mint
for them! The Mrs. has around 40 hours into ours! &lt;eep&gt;! Likewise if anyone
wants patterns/dimensions for a splittie bus I could eventually get them
organized.
(That's it Rusty, stick your neck out while you are all ready too busy!!!!)
