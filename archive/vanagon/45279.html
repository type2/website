Subject: looking for Crew Cab Window rubber

Hi Volks,
  I recieved this message today.  I could think of anyone who sell this
rubber seal.  Perhaps someone out there might.  Thanks.  -Jim

&gt;I am Bob Presser and live in San Antonio, Texas, I have a 1968 Crew Cab that
&gt;is being painted as we speak.  Do you have a source for the rear
&gt;door/drivers side rear side window rubber?  I have not been able to find
&gt;this piece of rubber.   Thank you for your time.
