Subject: STICKERS AND T-SHIRTS

Ok kids, Here's the word on List merchandise. Ken Hooper, who graciously runs
the type2 list, has asked me to refrain from using that name on anything, as he
has plans for it in the future. Therefore, the stickers and shirts would be the
same design as before, and would feature only the Vanagon_at_Lenti address. The
shirts would, of course, still feature front views of all 4 generations of
busses.
 That being said, I am curious as to how much demand there is for list shirts
and stickers. Bearing in mind that all the aircooled folks will still have the
watercooled address, which is, though our roots as a list.
 I ask that you not respond unless you are 100% serious about following through
with a purchase. I am merely testing the waters, to see what the market will
be.
If you would be interested in a shirt, or stickers, featuring ONLY the V_at_L
address, please let me know, and I shall measure the response.
Also, then be aware that Ken will be selling some sort of merchandise with the
type2 address sometime in the future, partly to help support the list.
Anyway, let me know...
