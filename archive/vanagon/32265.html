&gt;Greetings Sports Fans!!
&gt;
&gt;I just returned from the car wash with my 1987 Westie Syncro.  I 
&gt;managed to get the remnants of our last ski trip off and was thinking 
&gt;about how running boards would look.  I don't think I would lose to 
&gt;much clearance if they are mounted properly.  I think it would protect 
&gt;the sides much better than the standard &quot;Drill Big Holes in the side of 
&gt;the Van&quot; mud flaps.  They might even work better than the Harry 
&gt;&quot;MacGyver&quot; Yates' specialty mud-flaps.  Check out his homepage if you 
&gt;are curious.

Don't believe there are any such things. The jackpoint step things in JC
Whitney seem inadvisable to me because of the loss of ground clearance and I
bet they don't look good either.

The best looking things of this type are the awsome tubular steel rocker
panel protectors from Projecktwo in Germany. Comes complete with double tube
front and rear bumpers. Looks absolutely fanastic. I think these side things
might be called nerf bars by USA 4x4 people but I cannot remember right now.
The complete set of bumpers and nerf bars from Projecktwo, as I remember, a
few years ago, was something like $1,500 or so plus duty plus shipping.

&gt;My questions are...
&gt;
&gt;1) Has anyone mounted running boards on a Westie before?
&gt;2) What brand names should I look out for?
&gt;3) Will it look stupid?  We still want to look good you know!!  ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
