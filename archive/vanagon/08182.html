&gt; Hi, I've got a 1993 Frod 3/4 ton conversion van with 16,500 miles on it
&gt; and it only gets about 16mpg, so....
&gt; My idea is to yank the 5.0L and go to my Chevy dealer to buy a new 2.0L
&gt; four cylinder to drop in. I figure this should increase the milage to a
&gt; more respectable 23mpg or so.

The 2.0 liter 4-cyl would be good, and improve mileage a *bit*, but to
really improve the mileage, you should ask them about the 1.0 liter
3-cylinder motors from the Geo Metros.  My friend's wife's cousin replaced
the 350 in his Chevy Crew-Cab C30 Pickup with one of these, and is now
getting 26 mpg city!  On the highway, even towing his race car with the
bed full of tools, he is able to get about 30 mpg.

For the *drastic* improvement you seem to be looking for, though, you'd
have to go to an auto rebuilder for a VW diesel; only 55 hp, but *awesome*
torque!  In the old Rabbit, they would get over 60 mpg; in your full-size
van, who knows, maybe 40-50 mpg!  Of course, to realize this type of
mileage, you'd have to change the rear-gear of the van to the 2.21-2.41
range.  To ease the load on the motor, you'd also have to use the flexible
driveshaft found on the 1962 Pontiac Tempest; K-Mart sells replacements
for these for about $12.50 each, and you'll need to glue two of them
together with some Duco cement in order to get them to reach the rear
axle.  The flexible driveshaft absorbs the excess loads, since your van
will be slightly heavier than the Rabbit the motor was originally intended
for.  Of course, you'll have to add the diesel fuel-tank and lines, but
these are available over the counter at your Ford dealer.

&gt;I have a friend with a 4 cyl Caravan and he
&gt; pulls a camper with no trouble, and this is what I plan to do as well. I
&gt; have several questions. 1. Does anyone make motor mount kits for this type
&gt; of canversion,

Well, if you want to stick with the 2.0 liter idea, you're in luck,
because GMC trucks has recognized the desireability of their 4-cyl motor
(same as the Chevy) in the RV market, and sells the complete kit, with
everything you need.  Just call your closest GMC dealer for the exact part
number and price (or your Cadillac dealer, who carries such things as
well).  I think it runs about $55-$58 or so for the whole kit.

&gt;2. Will the tranny bolt up to the 2.0L,

Yes, but you have to mount it *backwards*, since the entire Ford design in
drivetrains runs in the *opposite* direction of the industry standard.
All necessary adapters are in the kit, however.

&gt;3. Will it be much trouble to wire the 2.0L into the existing harness,

If you get a complete 2.0L with distributorless ignition, then you just
run an 8-guage cable from the positive battery terminal to the #1 cylinder
coil (it is marked &quot;+&quot;), and a 3' length of 24 guage COPPER (NOT
ALUMINUM!) wire from the negative battery terminal to any clean ground on
the block.  Everything else is self-contained in the engine.

&gt;4. What kind of break-in should I allow?

For the initial start-up, drain the engine oil and add two-stroke oil to
3&quot; above the fill level on the dipstick.  Short the spark-plugs to the
fuse box inside the car, and crank the motor for 7-8 minutes.  Then drain
the 2-cycle oil, add to the transmission, add 1 1/2 qts oil to the motor,
reconnect the plugs, and drive for 2 hours or so at highway speeds,
varying your speed between 65-75 mph.  Then just drive it like you
normally would.

&gt; I plan to use slick50 and high quality filters so the engine will hold up
&gt; well.  I may also replace the 15&quot; rims with 16&quot; rims for a further
&gt; increase in milage.

A little known trick could save you some money here: 16&quot; tires will
actually *fit* on 15&quot; rims with an inexpensive set of lip-extenders (your
Ford dealer will have these in stock; they use them on their truck line
all the time).  Your local garage probably has never heard of them, since
it is a dealer-only item, so *insist* that he call the Ford dealer for
them; otherwise he is just trying to rip you off for something you don't
need.

&gt; Any help would be appreciated, as I plan to take the van to Colorado in
&gt; late January.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!

Lots of luck! Let us know how it all turns out!
