&gt; Anybody got quick n' easy way to test for a bad injector on an '82 Oil

I take mine to a Bosch certified diesel fuel injection shop.  They test
the injectors free while I wait.  They are listed in my telephone book
yellow pages under &quot;diesel fuel injection - sales &amp; service&quot;.  Of course,
you need a deep socket of the correct size and a new heat shield every
time you replace an injector.
