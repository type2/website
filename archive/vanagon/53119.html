&gt; Nobody has ever heard about anybody changing the oil, although somebody from
&gt; South Africa asked just this same question to us about 6 months ago nobody
&gt; knew the answer. It sounds like the answer is to find Visco Drive. I'll do a
&gt; search for them.
&gt; 
&gt; Alta Vista turns up somebody called Schumacher Visco Drive at
&gt; http://ally.ios_dot_com/~millha19/schumacher/viscous.html but closer inspection
&gt; reveals this is viscous coupling for toy race cars (really!).
&gt; 
&gt; Euroseek turns up nothing for Visco Drive.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a Austrian white page telephone listing at www.atp.at/herold/ but
&gt; when I tried it the atp.at server was down so maybe somebody else can try it
&gt; or you will have more luck accessing from France.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a German Yellow pages at www.gelbe-seiten_dot_de/ but I couldn't
&gt; figure out how to search for &quot;Visco Drive&quot; because the site is all in
&gt; German, which I cannot read.
&gt; 
&gt; The rest of Europe appears to be at http://206.129.166.101/intl/int.html but
&gt; I think some body needs to submit &quot;Visco Drive&quot; who has broader language
&gt; skills than I have.

&gt; &gt;Hello Guys,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As I wrote in my last mail, a lot of Syncroists in the Club are very
&gt; &gt;interested in how to get theirs Syncros fixed because as they get olders
&gt; &gt;(the vans, not the owners...), some of them have viscous coupling problems
&gt; &gt;and, of course, turbo diesel engines. And as you surely know, the VW dealers
&gt; &gt;prices for parts and repairs are fairly expensive in our country.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So that's why we would be very interested in finding correspondants in
&gt; &gt;Germany for all these kinds of problems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Maybe you'll be able to help me out about a question :
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Viscous coupling : They are built in a company called Visco Drive, but I'm
&gt; &gt;not sure whether it's in Germany or Austria. The fact is, when they break,
&gt; &gt;it's usually only a matter of silicon oil, they are OK mechanically, but the
&gt; &gt;company doesn't want to tell which kind of oil it is. Just go to the VW
&gt; &gt;dealer and get a new visco for about $3100 in France. Kind of expensive
&gt; &gt;oil... Any idea about this? If we'd know about this oil, problems would be
&gt; &gt;fixed. Only need to remove one screw, change the old oil and that's it! How
&gt; &gt;do we found out about this? One of the Club's member got one from a wreck
&gt; &gt;and put it on his Syncro. After that he opened the old one, everything,
&gt; &gt;discs included was OK except the oil. It seemed that there was a kind of
&gt; &gt;rusty greasy liquid instead of clean silicon. If someone knows exactly about
&gt; &gt;this oil caracteristics, it'll be very helpful for all Syncro's addicts and
&gt; &gt;save big bucks!! We're still working on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;

Yes, Derek is right, Shumacher is a RC car with viscous coupling. 
Silicon oil is used on RC cars in couplings and shock absorbers. Its 
graded from 100 to 10000 in viscosity. It comes in so small bottles that 
filling a coupling to a syncro... well,I think with the right viscocity 
it will probably work. Scania trucks also use silicon oil in the fan to 
the engine. If I had a coupling to try on, why not? Could save some 
bucks.
