I used to have a trickle charger (2 amps, I think) mounted in the interior of
my van.  I opened a small sliding window for venting.  I left it plugged in
all the time and when it was time to leave, I simply unplugged the charger
(left the connections on) and drove away.  This way it always kept a charge.
