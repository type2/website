Subject: Fuel Injection


	Brent Jarvi asks what he can replace fuel injection with.
	Brent, experience in the 914 world, with the same type 4
motor in 1.7, 1.8 and 2.0 litre configurations, is to leave the FI
in place. Replace all the vaccuum hoses with new ones. replace the
oil cap o-ring if you have a 1.8. Replace the seals around the injectors,
and check all the hoses, but the FI gives the most, and most reliable,
horsepower for a street car. 
	Its funny, everything else on my 914 gave me fits but the
FI always worked just fine.
