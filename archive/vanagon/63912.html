Ron: Thanks for asking!! I too have been wondering what &quot;FLAPS&quot; stood
for, thought it must be a &quot;back east&quot; chain like Pep Boys. Then others
from the west coast refered to their local FLAPS. I guessed it was
&quot;Foreign ? Auto Parts Store&quot;, or maybe &quot;Favorite Local Auto Parts Store&quot;.
