I am stuck in Merrillville, Indiana with my '87 Vanagon camper, watercooled,
2.1 liter, 4 speed, and a rod blew a grapefruit sized hole in my engine....I
need an engine, either a good rebuilt or a good low mileage
replacement....the great vacation plans have been scrapped until one can be
found.  The vehicle now sits at M.V.P., Inc. in Merrillville...telephone #
219-947-1581, 3990 E. Lincoln Highway in Merrillville.   I am currently at
Telephone # 847-272-6145, urgent response would be greatly
&gt;appreciated....e-mails also accepted.  Any recommendations as to what to do
&gt;will also be greatly appreciated....Thanks!!
