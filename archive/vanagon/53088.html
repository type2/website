Subject: ? Automatic Tranny Re-install Tricks?

Hi All,

This weekend I plan on re-installing an automatic tranny in my red 84
Vanagon.  The motor is currently out also.  I recall having a bit of a
time getting the shift linkage off and I fear that that will be my
toughest chore on getting it going again.  Any advice or tricks in getting 
things back together again?  I have studied the Bentley's.  8-)
