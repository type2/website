Subject: '86 still plagued! (was rich running)
Date: Thu, 3 Jul 1997 13:59:40 -0400

Hi Volks,

Yep, the dreaded rich running '86 is still pissed :-(  Still starting hard,
won't take gas for about 15-20 secs after it starts, smokes a bit, gets bad
mileage, poor power, plugs black.

I've followed everybody's suggestions, scoured the archives and tracked Dan
Houg's footsteps, all to no avail. Here's everything I've done:

1) checked and cleaned all the grounds
2) checked the temp sensor (swapped with new to make sure)
3) checked and cleaned the AFM (swapped with new to make sure)
4) checked the ECU (swapped with new to make sure)
5) checked all FI wiring
6) checked for vacuum leaks
7) checked fuel pressure

I'll be checking engine compression next to make sure. I may have forgot to
list something ot another.

Does anyone have any other suggestions at all??

I am just about to give up on this van. And to think I sold my trusty 83.5
to &quot;upgrade&quot; to this!!!!

I hate to say this on the H2O list, but it makes me appreciate my '71
rustfalia. Even with a leaky and dirty carb and many years of neglect
continues to run...

Sorry for whining :-(

If VW still offered a new van, I'd be at the bank right now!
