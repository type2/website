Subject: Re: 71 Westy and Door Handles


&gt;I am stuck with the problem on both the drivers and passengers door
&gt;that if the door is locked and you pull the trigger (for lack of a
&gt;better word)
&gt;to open the door you can no longer unlock the door with a key.

 About 75% of the time, a shot of WD-40 into the lock slot, works
wonders for me, since the mechanisms were really dirty inside. The
other 25%, I have to remove the door handles and bring them to a
locksmith, 'cuz the mechanisms are worn out-- hardly surprising for
a vehicle that's old enough to vote.

Good luck!
