&gt; 
&gt; I purchased my '73 Campmobile with 60,000 miles on the original 1.7 engine.  

&gt; 
&gt; On a related note, how long does a transaxle last?

A fair estimate according to Muir is 250,000+ miles.  Supposedly the older
ones were indestructible.  My bus (a '77) has 156K and is still on the
original clutch!
