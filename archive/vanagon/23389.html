Subject: Re: 6v fuel guage in 12v bu

                      RE&gt;&gt;6v fuel guage in 12v bus                 8/24/95

I apologize for using the bandwidth to repeat both messages below in full, but
- 

         TIME OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(Pontification &quot;on&quot;)      :-)
The way every fuel gauge I know works is:  a movable float in the tank
responds to the fluid level present, and moves a pickup on a variable
resistor, kinda like a volume control.  When the tank is full, 0 to minimum
reisistance is inserted into the followng circuit:   +12 from battery, through
gauge, through variable resistor in tank, to ground. (Some circuits may go the
other way, battery, variable resistor, gauge, ground - doesn't matter.)  When
the tank is near empty, maximum resistance is added, so the gauge deflects the
least &quot;(empty&quot; reading, same as when the power is off).  

OK - there is a relationship between Voltage (+12 battery), resistance (the
variable resistor in the tank) and current (amps - what makes the gauge in
this configuration deflect).  That relation is called Ohm's Law.  Simply
stated Voltage = Amps times Resistance.

When you went from feeding the fuel gauge circuit +6 volts to +12 volts, (I am
assuming)  you did not change either the gauge or the resistor in the fuel
tank.  Therefore if you double the applied voltage, and  don't change the
variable resistor in the tank, you double the amps.  Since the gauge
responds/reflects a linear relation (pretty much) between needel deflection
and amps, with double the amps, it will try to double it's deflection, hence
it will always read &quot;high&quot;.

(End of Pontification)

SOoooooo   - before you take the drastic steps to drill and cut holes looking
for a short - try changing the the sender from a 6volt unit to a 12 volt unit.
 If you really want to be crude about it, you could add an additional resistor
into the circut, equal in value to the maximum resistance of the 6 volt
sender.  The reason this is crude is that when the tank was empty, the gauge
will still read 1/2 (correspondingly, a reading of 3/4 full really means 1/2
full, etc.).
