Subject: re Eurovan brake vibration

&gt;My 95 Eurobago has developed a pulsation of the brake pedal
&gt;when applied at speeds above 50 mph;  feels like something is
&gt;out of balance between the pedal and the road.  My original
&gt;Goodyear tires have 20k miles, cann't see any uneven wear.
&gt;VW replaced the front brake rotors; this didn't change anything.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone had a similar problem, or know the cause of such resonance?
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

I have seen many problems with ABS systems caused by Ferrous particles stuck to the
magnetic ABS sensor at the wheel.  If too much ferrous material is present the sensor will
not read the serrations on the wheel or CV joint and will tell The ABS computer that that
wheel is locked and must be pulsed (what you are feeling through the pedal).  The ferrous
material comes from normal wear of the rotors.  I always clean the sensors off with
compressed air when I have the wheels off of an ABS equipped vehicle in my shop and this
avoids vague ABS malfunctions.

Questions/comments?
