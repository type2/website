Subject:      Re: '87 Syncro Westie Starting problems

While the starter solenoid may be one place to check, also consider the
ignition / starter switch itself. If the &quot;start&quot; position is making
intermittent contact it could also cause these symptoms, and I've seen similar
problems; especially when someone leaves a heavy key ring hanging on the
ignition key.

It sometimes starts with the key and sometimes we need to
push start it.  It is *very* intermittent.  When it does not start, there is
no
starter noise.  The lights come on at the dash are, so the ignition is
working,
but no starting.  It happened twice on this trip.  The goofy thing is, it may
not start, so we push start.  we drive for a while and then stop.  It will
then
start with the key.... maybe.  Very intermittent and irritating.  I crawled
underneath last night and trace all of the ignition wires as per Bentley.
They
are all tight and rust free.  The last time this happened, 1 month ago, I
tightened all connections.  I don't think this was the problem.  The van
wasn't driven much over the last month so I cannot say for sure.
