&gt;From: David Schwarze &lt;schwarze_at_superc.nosc_dot_mil&gt;:
&gt;Oh, I just got back from Solar Electric, to buy aluminum frames for the
&gt;solar panels I bought a coupla months ago.  At Martha's request, I took
&gt;a closer look at the Golf cart batteries they had:
&gt;
&gt;Brand:		Trojan
&gt;Weight:	61 lbs.
[...]

Let me say these are great batteries!  I've been running my ham radio
equipment off a pair for 6 years and they're still going great.  I 
keep them continually trickle charged at 13.00 volts and use them as
high amperage sources for amplifiers.  I use them indoors, which people
say never to do, and have had no trouble with hydrogen or acid fumes
at this charging potential.  They do seep a film of acid from the filler
ports, but a wipe soaked in baking soda water every couple of months 
takes care of that.  

These would be a great power source for a camper if you have room for 
two more batteries.  When not in use, I would take them out and put a
small constant voltage charger on them to keep them topped up.
