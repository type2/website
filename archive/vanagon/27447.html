&gt; Ok, let's really open this can of worms.  I've yet to hear/see anything 
&gt; that totally disenchants me from the notion of hydrogen fuels, outside of 
&gt; the technological challenges, which as we all know are not 
&gt; insurmountable.  And like photovoltaics, once the market starts to 
&gt; recognize hydrogen as a viable alternative fuel, the price will drop to 
&gt; acceptable levels.

Ummm... you're joking, right?  The price of Photovoltaics hasn't dropped
significantly in the 15 years I've been paying attention to them.
Last I heard we were still waiting for some sort of breakthrough that
would allow them to be manufactured cheaply (and for their efficiency
to rise).
