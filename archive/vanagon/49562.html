So EdBuzz_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; Calif. this is not permitted.That is stupid.Calif,in particular, does an
&gt; immense amount of overregulating needlessly, just for the sake of
&gt; regulating.
Not for the sake of regulating, for the sake of $$$$$$.  Gotta keep those
resolutions going so they have an excuse to exist....

As with you, I'm not against stopping pollution, but I think their way
of regulating really sucks.  And it seems to have only one intention in
mind.  To fanagle/bamboozel/scam in any way possible as much money from
the average car owner as possible and make it look legitimate.  Kind of
like politicians.
