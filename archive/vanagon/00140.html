Subject: Re: Kombi, Kombi, who's got the Kombi ... (differences)

Don't know much about post '67 stuff. But pre '67 khombi's were vans
with 3 square windows down the side. They came with no door panels in the
back, and came without any banch seats in the back. However, bench seats 
were an option. 

A friend of mine claims that Kombi is short for the name of the town in 
Germany where vans were made. Sounds pretty far fetched to me. i've
also heard that its short for what busses were called in Germany.
Again, i don't know about that.
