Subject: Re: Any listmembers near Renton, WA

&gt;  Hello,  I'm interested in a syncro in Renton but I'm in CA.  If I could
&gt;somehow entice someone into checking it out for me.  Beer $$ !! Pretty
&gt;please.

Peter,

        I'm traveling to Seattle for Memorial day and staying a week, I
know that's an eternity from now when your interested in a bus. If you
don't get somebody to look at it-- I'll help. My sis lives in Renton, so
I'll be right there.  BTW this is a pre-move reconnoiter, from Ohio baaack
to the Emerald City late this summer.
