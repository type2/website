Subject: Re: Roof Racks for Westies

An alternative to using a roof rack is to install a towing hitch receiver.
A number of bike/ski racks are available that fit quite securely in a 2&quot;
receiver hitch. Graber has a model called the Outback that allows
conversion from 2 to a 4 bike/ski configuration. It's very solid and works
well.

Works for me.
