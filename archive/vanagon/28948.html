&gt; hello there all!
&gt;    well its been a while since i have been able to do any real work on
&gt; the bus lately.... ever since i found out I AM GOING TO BE A POPPA!!!!
&gt; sorry, i have to tell everyone that:)  anyway i have a few questions
&gt; here and there about some things, and wanted some advice, so here
&gt; 
&gt; HEATER FAN QUESTIONS:
&gt; - how can i check and make sure the fan/motor is in good shape?

Most newborns don't have these and you wouldn't want them to.  Older 
toddlers can heat up pretty quickly and fanning their rear ends, I've 
been told, can help out quite a bit.


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; TRANNY and BREAK MAINTENANCE QUESTIONS:

I suggest you definately take lot's of breaks during the first year.  
You're going to need them.  And that's Granny (not tranny) your best bet 
when it comes to pawning off the kid so you can take a break.

&gt; LUBRICATION:
&gt; i also want to lubricate everything i can.  &lt;

Don't worry about this too much.  Baby oil is best but keep lot's of 
Desitin around to stop the really loud noises.  I'm told that Gold Bond 
powder is also useful for quieting these noises.  The lubrication 
schedule for newborns is pretty light actualy, after about 3 months 
you'll start getting lot's of demands and rude noises.

&gt; 
&gt; well, i'll stop there for now, but will probably be hitting eveyone up
&gt; again real soon for some collective wisdom.  hope all is going well
&gt; for everyone!

(for the humor impaired) --&gt;;)

Congratulations on the Poppa thing.  Sorry I can't help more on the VW 
thingy but I've had my son longer than my van.

&gt; 
&gt; take care,
&gt; 	brandy
