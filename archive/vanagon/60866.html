&gt;Is it possible to buy or build from spare parts a brand new Vanagon GL? Was

1991 was the last year in the u.s. i believe that 1990 was the last year in
europe and elsewhere. the first year of the Eurovan was 1991 in europe.

yes, it IS possible. anything is possible with enough time and money. :)
but it may be much more expensive than you can imagine. i recall about thirty
years ago, some idiot magazine allowed one of their editors to build a vw
beetle from parts he bought across the parts counter. at the time, a showroom
ready-to-drive beetle cost only $2000.

i guess my point is: it might be POSSIBLE, but not be worth it. ;)
