 Please read and enjoy!

As snow falls down here in the east

The blizzard of 96...oh what a beast!

The snow piles high inches and foot

Sidewalks and rooftops, traffic's kaputt!

Walking down streets the scene was so dreamy

each car and truck looked like a white pop-top westy!

Oh what a world my mind could imagine

everyone with there own mobile cabin.

But then came the roar of the scrape of the plow.

My minds back in reality now.

I'm happy my Volkswagen is quite unique

and not everyone understands its individual mystique.


Note:  I had to keep my mind busy while shoveling snow!
       I hope it made you smile.
