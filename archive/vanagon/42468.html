&gt;Today when I went to add oil to my bus ('76), I noticed a strange substance
&gt;on the inside of the filler tube. It looks like slimey peanut butter. Does
&gt;anyone know what this is? Also, what does this mean? Is my engine filled
with
&gt;peanut butter and soon to self destruct? Has anyone else ever seen this?

Special combination of combustion gas blowby, carbon, and condensation.  Add
heat and aeration,(foam) but enough heat to drive out all the
moisture,(winter driving, no t-stat helps) and you have that special
combination.  If engine is healthy,(do leak down test), do not worry.  Change
oil more frequently or use synthetic, make sure engine is warming up
properly.
