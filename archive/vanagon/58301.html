Subject: Re: Floor Mats

I can't remember, exactly. I ordered two different kinds just to see. I seem
to remember being happiest with mats, possibly from JC Whitney, which came
with a plastic guard under the feet to keep the mats from wearing. I
carefully cut the sewing off that held these plastic guards on so I ended up
with real nice looking guardless mats.

So, of the available options, try to order the mats with guards and then
consider cutting the guards off. The line goes away in about a week from
where the guard was attached.

&gt;Back in `95 you posted a very complete summary of the available options for
&gt;Vanagon floor mats. You ended your post asking for reccomendations on the JC
&gt;Whitney mats. I was wondering if you received any responses to to your
query and
&gt;what you finally decided to purchase. Also- are you satisfied with your
&gt;decision?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
