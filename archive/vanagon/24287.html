&gt; TypeII rocker panel replacement parts that fit require two sources.
&gt; 
&gt; Inner rocker panels that fit: Das Bulli Haus (203) 642-7242
&gt; 
&gt; Outer rocker panels that fit: Wolfsburg West (714) 630-WOLF
&gt; 
&gt; ** Personal experience as of 11/94 was that ordering both pieces from either
&gt; source didn't fit worth beans. A combo as stated above fit pretty straight
&gt; ahead! I'm sure that both sources are reputable good people and their
&gt; mothers love them and all that poop. The suppliers used by these sources may
&gt; have changed since 11/94. It seems silly to suggest two sources for this
&gt; common repair but it worked for us. It has been my experience that metal
&gt; pieces from some suppliers are only roughly the original shape/size and
&gt; needed alot of trimming. The history of each bus (previous hidden collision
&gt; damage etc.) may dictate the way any repair panel fits **

I did the exact same combo.  The inners from Das Bulli fit bodacious, but
the outers bit weenie.  Next time I'm gonna try outers from Das Bulli...
