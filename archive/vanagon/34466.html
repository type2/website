Subject: Wing window replacement

	Hello, I bought a '79 bus in Nov. and recently I discovered that 
the wing window, on the window behind the drivers seat, has had the 
pivioting post on the bottom side of the window cut.  I don't know why 
but it looks like it was done with a hacksaw blade.  There is rust on the 
cut so it is not a new attempt, and the seller *forgot* to tell me about 
it.  so now with heavy rains I discover that a river is flowing in 
through the bottem of the window.
	I do not have a clue on how to get the window out so I can 
replace it.  I tried to wiggle it out but the post on the top is still 
good and does not give me enough play.  I need help on how to get it out 
and how to get another one in.  Or maybe someone can suggest a book I can 
get at the library.  Thanks,
	   		     -Brian
