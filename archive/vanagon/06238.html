Subject: Re: pre-tour warm-up

OK, there seems to be a STRONG sentiment to avoid the mountains and
snow in winter for this trip.  I've reread the 20+ responses on
this matter and there's been a noticeable tendency to prefer the
CA coast.  I rather like David Garth's suggestion of the Pfeifer
Big Sur State Park, since, as he puts it, it should be warmer
relatively speaking, and &quot;has it all:&quot;  redwoods, waterfalls,
river, ocean.  (David, it had BETTER have showers!  :).  Anyway,
in the spirit of democracy, I suggest we do go with the majority's
wish to stay on the coast, and mid-state seems fair when I look
at the stats, considering the number of people all over the state, plus
additional states to the south, and to the north.  

At any rate, I suggest we take the suggestion to go to Pfeifer Big
Sur State Park, and will call tomorrow to have them mail me
some literature.  Now, we just need to pick a weekend.  Most
of you didn't have as strong of feelings on this matter,
although 2 people could not do it during the next 2 weekends.
What's your preference?  Early December?  January?  

Let me know!
