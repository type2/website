Derek wrote about a VW Van Club in South Africa and asked if anyone
had any additional info on how to get in touch.

Here's a suggestion.  There's a South African BBS on the internet
(soc.culture.south-africa).  It's mostly filled with political stuff,
but people do pass travel info and search for folks in SA.  Perhaps
one of you more experienced netters could try to reach them thru this
BBS.

Just a thought.

Ted
