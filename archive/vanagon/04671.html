Subject: List Stuff - changes

VW Crazies,
I've made some changes in the running of the list.  Things should be 
slightly faster, but the way life usually goes, it'll probably break.  
This message serves as a test as well as an announcement.

Let me know if you see any problems.

Thanks, and enjoy!

My carpool mate thinks I need a twelve step program for VWs to rid me of 
this addiction.
