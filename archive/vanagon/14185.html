Subject: 6v wipers on 12v bus


Sorry this is late, but I thought that maybe I could help.  Of the 12V to 6V
conversion methods proposed:

1) forget the resistor based solution, it will either put a strain on
   the wiper motor, or will not work in cold weather, depending on
   how you adjust your resistor value.  It is also quite a fire hazard, if the
   resistor is not of correct power rating -- they do not fail safe.


2) Bradley's posted wiring diagram will work, provided the 2N3055 transistor
   is well heat sinked.  It needs to be electrically isolated from the
   chassis, but highly coupled to it heatwise, as somebody suggested.
   This is a viable option.  The transistor will heat up, but the chassis can
   be one heck of a heat sink, so the transistor will not normally melt down.
   In the case of a badly coupled heat sink, this diagram is fail safe, 
   i.e., the transistor will fail fast, it will probably not cause a fire.

   The energy wasted on the transistor will be about the same as the one
   used up by the wipers, so it is now terrible.

   also, note that the diagram becomes the same as the other proposed
   solution with the zener diode, when the chip listed in U1 is replaced
   with a zener diode (only a little more crude but will work for wipers). 



3) David Kao is correct in that it does still waste energy.  His proposed
   solution is the best.  I disagree with the part about synchronizing
   the period of the 'oscillator' with the wiper cycle; too much trouble
   and too much wiring, if you really want to make it a feedback based
   system.  Also, by turning the Transistor on and off at 50% duty cycle, 
   one actually generates an AC voltage that has a 6V DC component in it,
   i.e., the 6V is there to be used... Hence, one alternative might be to
   keep the frequency of the on-off cycle quite high (5-10 Hz. maybe?) with
   still 50% duty cycle, i.e.,  on = off times, but a BIG capacitor in
   parallel with the wipers ( maybe a 1000 uF 24 V ) to help average the
   voltage to 6V.

   This setup would definitely waste no energy, and the parts would stay
   cool.  However, it is a little more complex than option 2.

4) replace the wipers with a 12V set.

of the options above , 4 gets my vote -- in the long run, it is the *simplest*
solution...  2 and 3 are almost equal, depends on your taste.  stay away
from one.

(David, wannna attempt to draw an ascii schema of what you've been
talking about?)

Here's the diagram Bradley posted, for a second look:
