Subject: O2 sensor, 2.1L

Greetings list,
        I am replacing the O2 sensor in my 91. Several people have mentioned
using a &quot;generic&quot; three-wire sensor ($30-50) instead of the Bosch
($140-190). However, after several trips to various local flaps, I still
haven't found the O2 sensor I'm looking for. If anyone can help me out, I
need some specific information. Make/part number of the 'generic' O2 sensor
would be best. Year/make/model of the car it was 'designed' for would be
second best.

Thanks much,
Pat
