&gt; 71), and the garanteed 20 deg. of free play when steering arm bushing
&gt; housing  rots way!     Mike Benthin in NJ

This is utterly terrifying, lost the bushing mounting on the
old '76 Bus once, going around a curve 40 mph or so, suddenly bus is 
going one way, I'm turning another, bus is not responding whatsoever, 
cross lanes, about to hit curb, brakking hard, just stopped.  Tow
home.  Oddly didn't see this one coming, rest of beam, towers and all
were 100% solid, the pressed mounting for the bushing had rusted
at its seams from inside, and just poof fractured clean off when
I hit a pothole.  Really Really a terrible experience.  With that
pin not mounted, steering totally disfunctional.

John
