Subject: Silver socket stuff

Howdy all...
I'm in Germany right now, and found a store in munich that sells the 
silver socket parts pretty cheap.  They have extra sockets, and plugs, 
and a universal plug that functions as a regular cigarette lighter plug, 
or a DIN plug.

So, if anyone wants any extra silver socket stuff let me know.  I'll 
pick up some.
