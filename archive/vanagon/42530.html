Subject: 1985 Vanagon

Hello,
        I've come for some advice on purchasing a 1985 Vanagon.  It appears
to be in good condition although it needs a new exhaust system.  My
questions are:

Is $1,250 a good deal for a 1985 Vanagon w/ 115,000 miles?  Is it too good
of a price, that is should I expect a major problem?

Are there any standard faults or problems that I should look for it this
model year?

Is there a &quot;Type&quot; such as &quot;Type II&quot;  for this model year or might there be?

Any and all comments will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
