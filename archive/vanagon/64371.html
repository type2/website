BUSSES BY THE ARCH #12 near St. Louis, Missouri
Labor Day weekend  --  August 29, 30 &amp; 31, 1997

Well, we're in the final stages of preparing for the arrival of many of you here
in the
suburbs of St. Louis next weekend.  We're expecting a big crowd, probably our
biggest yet.  Door prizes have been arriving, the trophies and T-shirts should
be
ready and I'm packing up the van.  A notable Type 2 dignitary, the estemed
Charlie
Ford will be in attendance as well as the &quot;Mothership&quot;.  If you haven't met this

delightful southern gentleman yet, here's your chance.  Has he got a story to
tell
around a campfire or what?  I'm looking forward to seeing you again, Charlie!
And
this time we won't run out of beer!

Kathryn and I want to thank you for your overwelming understanding concerning
our
going to a once a year, fall &quot;Busses By the Arch&quot; .  It was getting to be too
much to do
two events and we needed the break!  We hope that you got to enjoy the
&quot;Uneventful
Event&quot; in May at the Quad Cities which was great!  Now we're rested and ready to
go!

So come join us for the upcoming, legendary  &quot;Busses By the Arch&quot; camping
weekend
sponsored by NEATO and LiMBO.  This family camping event will feature a
gathering
of Volkswagen Transporters (usually 80-100 Type 2's) of all types and era's from
all
over the U.S.A.  We are looking forward to seeing both you and your Type 2
amidst all
the Split-windows, Bubble-windows, Vanagons, Eurovans and other VW's this fall.

&quot;Busses By the Arch #12&quot; will be held rain or shine Friday through at least
Sunday,
August 29, 30 &amp; 31, 1997 at Cherokee Lakes and Campground in O'Fallon, MO.  This

privately run facility is located on Hwy 79 seven miles northwest of Interstate
70 and is
about 35 miles west of downtown St. Louis and the Gateway Arch.  So don't drive
to the
Arch and expect to see us camped there!!!  The area reserved for our event has
both
open, grassy and shady, wooded camping areas.  Most any convenience that you
might ever need is within 15 minutes of camp.  Reservations are not needed or
taken

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday we plan to enjoy campfire activities, door
prizes, part
swapping and VW videos in addition to the &quot;site-to-site&quot; socializing and &quot;bus
banter&quot;
that this NEATO / LiMBO event is famous for.  On Saturday morning we're planning

another of our famous scenic bus caravans with a picnic stop.  Yes, we'll be
cruising
the very popular &quot;Double River Crossing&quot; tour utilizing two local car ferries to
cross
both the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers!  You won't want to miss it!  Saturday
night we'll
present owners choice awards in in several Type 2 classes in addition to vendor
door
prizes. Sunday you're free to visit the Gateway Arch, the St. Louis Zoo,
Historic Old
St. Charles, the Riverboat casinos or many other regional highlights.  It should
prove to
be a relaxed, fun weekend full of great Volkswagen experiences and new
friendships.

The only vehicles allowed to camp in our private BBA camping area will be
Volkswagens!
Anything else parks at the office and walks in to visit or camp.  If you're
thing of attending
and need more details and a map, send us your &quot;snail mail&quot; address, phone #, and
just
for fun tell us what VW's you own, and what VW Clubs you're a member of to:
72153.1620_at_compuserve_dot_com

We're looking forward to your arrival for a holiday weekend full of Volkswagen
fun.  Please
pass the word around to your VW friends about our NEATO / LiMBO event.  Then
wipe
down and pack up those Transporters (and other VW's) for the cruise to St. Louis
for the
12th &quot;Busses By the Arch&quot; campout over the upcoming Labor Day weekend in
O'Fallon,
Missouri.  We'll see you around the campfire!
