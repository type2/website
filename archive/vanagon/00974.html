Those VW &quot;climate control&quot; levers are about as intuitive as the choke on
my Norton Commando. Pull the choke lever to unchoke it.  Return the
lever to its untensioned position to choke it.
Actually the lever system is a primitive anti-theft system. Bake them thieven'
buggars or give 'em frost bite.
