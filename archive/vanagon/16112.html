So McGinnis Terry sez:
&gt;
&gt;Maybe I'll get lucky and find some brake drums at Vallejo this weekend, as I
&gt;can't see paying $150/EA when I have the post '64 axles, just will have to pay
&gt;to have them rebuilt and installed (about $100 total) as I don't want to open
&gt;up my precious tranny on my dirt driveway (no garage available to do the work
&gt;in).  But if you come up with anything before that, I'd be glad to here about
&gt;it.  Maybe someone out there has a Bentley for Bugs that gives the dimensions
&gt;for its brake components (diameter of drum, width of shoes, and diameter/length

The latest Hot VW's had a bit on bus/bug brake drums...

PS - While you're at Vallejo, please look for a early-early bus back bumper!
