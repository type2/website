&gt;In my '89 Syncro, there seems to be rain water leaking down past the
&gt;seals in each corner of the windshield, where a little low spot forms
&gt;from the angle between the glass and rubber.  Anybody have a hint about
&gt;sealing this up?
&gt;
Water was leaking into my bus as you described above.  I did a very quick fix
by running a bead of silicone sealant around both edges of the rubber, also
sealing a hole which had been gouged into the rubber on the driver's side.
 Did this last winter and it's held up through another wet one...  it'll do
til I replace all rubber on the bus!
