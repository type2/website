Subject: Portland Mechanic Recommendation
Date: Tue, 4 Jun 1996 09:59:57 -0500 (CDT)

I wonder if some kind soul could recommend a good, honest mechanic in 
the Portland area.  I know I am asking for the moon.  This would be 
for my sister who is getting really jerked around at the moment.  If 
this mechanic worked on american cars too that would be a bonus.

Thanks, Jim
