&gt; Subject: 84 Westy - *&amp;^#} sliding door handle - help!

&gt; I remember a fleeting reference on this list once about someone
&gt; using one of the older chrome slider handles that was a perfect
&gt; fit and didn't suffer from substandard metallurgy/engineering.

&gt; Can anyone offer more specific help i.e. appropriate model years,
&gt; caveats, etc. ?

&gt; I've searched the archives to no avail.

&gt; As a solution the older handle may not be pretty but I don't give
&gt; a damn as long as it works.

I may have provided the fleeting reference...I have an '84 GL and
the *inner* handle broke off.  I replaced it with a chrome-plated
handle from my '67 split parts.  It doesn't have the &quot;hinge&quot;
arrangement like the original, but it fits fine and works better
than the original (IMO).

If your broken handle is the *outer* handle, I'm not sure I can
provide much help.  My outer handle flopped around for a long
time too--until I pulled the interior panel and tightened the
phillips-head screw that holds it tight.  Whether an old *outer*
handle will fit remains to be seen, though I could probably try
one on my '84 for confirmation.
