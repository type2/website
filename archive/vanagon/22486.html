Elegy Written in a Country Junkyard
    by Thomas Gray Metallic

The setting sun defines the end of day,
  As doors and windows close against the night,
When tools and parts are left just where they lay,
  For easy use tomorrow at first light.

The cursing fades, the laughter ceases now,
  In ones and twos, the men are gone away.
Old Sol is slow to take his final bow
  As insects tune themselves and start to play.

It matters not the model, nor the year,
  Nor cost of purchase when the car was new,
For like a graveyard, all will enter here
  To rust beneath the sun and morning dew.

But there are some whose Karma reaches out,
  To kindred souls, for help to cheat the grave,
And whether whole, or whether parted out,
  Extend their lives upon the road they crave.

For these, the kindred few, this yard is not
  A place wherein their dread should make them shy,
Not like a graveyard, with decay and rot
  But more a warehouse, open to the sky.
