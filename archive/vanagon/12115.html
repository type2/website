	Well I suppose many of you may know this, but I saw what looked 
like a very nice synchro on the movie Endless Summer (2,  ?).  Since I 
had a few beers and the conversation was hot on surfing (there was some 
surf comp here is Santa Cruz this weekend) I did not realize that it must 
be a synchro in order for them to drive on the beach.  There was also 
another scene in which they were driving a dune buggy, with the vw logo 
clearly present on the steering wheel, and nearly ran into a clean white 
vanagon--Euro version I think.  That was the extent of my viewing, but I 
think I would like to see the movie in full now.  I guess surfing is not 
all that bad after all.
