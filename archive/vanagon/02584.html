This is a story about how I got my recent VW.  I had owned many years ago
various VW's (1974 Bradley GT, 1966 double cab, 1969 Ghia Convert).  I had
been reading Rec.auto.vw for a year, and learned a great deal from the list.
This is my first contribution to the Vanagon list, so I hope you enjoy!

                                   TRAMP

I bought Tramp (1982 Westy) in August of 93, after I had spent the whole spring
and summer searching for a Vanagon/camper. My wife was very sick and I felt that
getting out on the road after her treatments would improve her recovery, VW's
have that MAGIC quality about them.  She was released from the hospital the
2nd week of August, one week later I saw the ad in our local car trade paper.
I was well used to the idea of, Here I go again, I had checked out close to 20
vehicle's by now, most bus years '66-'86. I wanted to spend around 4-6
thousand dollars, but I wanted value for my money.  Most of the Vehicles were
very rusty and needed much work.  The ad description and reality description
were usually many miles (kilometer's) apart.

Well I answered the ad and set up an appointment to see the '82 Westy, it was
located at a house on Saratoga Lake NY.  Driving down a long curving gravel
driveway running parallel to the lake, I caught my first glimpse of Tramp.
Situated in a clearing of scrub pine tree's was a beautiful brown Vanagon/Westy
its pop-top opened catching the morning breeze blowing off the lake.  I can't
believe it, I thought to myself, It looks almost new.  The ad had an asking
price of $5400, which normally would be considered high for a regular '82 car.
I talked the regular small talk to Mike, like why he was selling it...He needed
money to fix us his house, which was a lake summer cabin, the money was going
to be used for a heating system.  I started my examination by crawling under the
car and seeing the condition, no rust. Went back to the engine clean, but the
exhaust was on its last legs.  Started it up, sounds nice...58,600 miles on
the speedo, drives great.  My wife's job was to check out the inside, she seemed
to think it was ok, the sink worked, the stove worked and he promised that the
fridge worked.  I wanted this Westy, but I wanted the price to be lower, we
dickered for 40 minutes finally we agreed to $4,400.  We went into his cabin
where I was immediately greeted by Jeff an older black Lab, Mike told of his
fun trips with Jeff to various states, right then and there warning bells should
have been ringing, but I was smitten.

Tramp was to be delivered by Mike the following day, I had to get money and
prepare for my new vehicle.  Mike dropped off Tramp at 5pm, and I started to go
to work.  I had taken the week off work, and planned to &quot;hit the road&quot; as soon
as Tramp was cleaned up.  It was a very hot afternoon and as soon as I got
into the Westy the odor hit me, Tramp really stunk.  I sniffed around and
determined the smell was from the seats and cushions, dog hair was everywhere.
This was not going to be easy!  I completely tore everything apart, driver and
passenger seats, rear seat, sleeping loft, cushions, washed all the cloth
and bought new foam ($ 150.00).  Three days later after renting a steam cleaner
($35+ 20 cleaning agent), I was almost ready.  The back compartment rug had
stain that would no go away, new carpet would be needed.  I could not find the
size rug need to match the rug there, I finally decided to put in a wood
parquet oak floor ($30.00 _at_Colortile).  I glued the tiles to the 1/4&quot; plywood
that was under the rug and taken out. I reinstalled it with no problems, using
the sheetmetal screws right through the parquet.  Just in case I needed access
to that area again. It was now Thursday, I changed the oil plugged in the
fridge, and loaded Tramp up.  We decided on tramp because of the heavy tramp
smell before we cleaned it up.  Friday morning we were off, we traveled to Cape
Cod, and camped out for two great nights.  To my dismay, I noticed that the
odometer was not moving, oh well, I thought another to do....
Our adventures with Tramp had just begun.
