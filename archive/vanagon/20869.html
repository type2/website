Subject: My Friday Fun

Hey now,
        Seen folks do this, so I figured I'd harp happily about my greasy
escapades.
        Red light on. No generator. Bummer. Pulled the old gen. out 2 days
ago, hoping to patch it up, no luck. Several phone calls later, I have a
generator on order-only $49! Lifetime Warranty! Bosch, but reman. by
someone else. Hey, if they'll warranty it, I don't mind paying half price!
So it's already out, gotta get the fan off. Don't want to remount gen., so
I struggle with odd wrench combinations. Manage to bend the belt pully out
of shape at the same time. Not very strong metal, next time I'm doing this
with the gen in the bus. Sitting gen. on counter, holding w/left hand, big
open end wrench in right, pulling on that big nut holding the fan to gen.
Only thing that breaks loose is the wrench, conking me a good one in the
forhead, and making blood drip down my face. Dumb. Don't try this at home,
doesn't feel very good.  ;-)
        That was yesterday. This morning I took the whole mess to the local
Texaco station; &quot;zip zip&quot; goes the impact wrench, and I wonder why I ever
screwed wtih that damn open end wrench.  ;-) Went to the salvage yard, got
a used pulley, and picked up a door handle while there (mine's had no lock
for the last 3 weeks).  Cleaned all the parts up real good, looks pretty,
time to put it back in. You all know how much fun it is to put the gen. in
while the engine is still in the car. Several blue words later, all is well
in mudville. Drive to work, red light flashing. Not good. New generator,
must be bad voltage reg.  Found one for $15, score! Easy to replace, and
while I did it, I had the new door handle re-keyed at the locksmith-$16 but
the same key works all the doors. Worth it to me. All works great now, no
red light, door that unlocks with my key and no one else's. A good days
work, and a pretty scar on my forhead to brag about. Life is good!! Hope
y'all learned from my misfortune.  ;-)
