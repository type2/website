&gt;Several days ago, someone posted a note saying that they had put plastic 
&gt;between the front and the back to keep warm.  This gave me an idea which
&gt;I did try tonight.  If you take an old blanket and place it over the 
&gt;headrests of the driver and passenger seat, with just a little dip
&gt;between the seats, the front part of the camper does seem to be
&gt;significantly warmer while driving.  The temperature outside is on the
&gt;order of 5 degrees tonight (that is F) and the difference is quite apparent.

I did something exactly like this in my last '67 bus.  I used a piece
of heavy canvas, and cut an hemmed it to fit the curve of the roof, and
used twist-fasteners to put it up with, so I could easily take it down.
This made a huge difference in the heat in the front!
