Subject: Mystery Black Box

I am still trying to identify the mysterious black box on my '81 Westie.
Plastic, sealed, with a double, heavier black wire, like lamp cord, a
single orange wire, and a double grey wire coming out of it.  It is 3&quot; by 2
1/2&quot; by 1&quot;, with three hole flat plastic mounting flanges on two sides.  It
says part #3206, and made in Taiwan.  I found it screwed to the metal air
channel behind where the glove box goes when I was taking out the AC, but
it doesn't seem associated with the AC.  The wires all go to the fuse
panel, as near as I can tell.

Anybody else have one?

Thanks,
Bill
