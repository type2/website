So SyncroHead_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; CCCs,
&gt; 
&gt; Somehow I missed the original message on this subject.  When is this trip
&gt; planned?
&gt; 

Well.... Since I didn't get any response on this one, I assumed no one
wanted to go.  Yours is the only real response I've got.  And since
Jason is only going to be there Friday night, I don't think it's worth
the drive...   Too bad....

Maybe next time....
