Subject: '87 mods???

Hey,

Just bought an '87 Vanagon that is in perfect shape except for its engine.

Since I am having a rebuild, I would like to get a little more usable 
power out of it.  I'm thinking about having the rebuild done by Fast 
German Auto.  However, they don't know of any performance mods I could make.
Anyone have any suggestions?  I'm looking for better low and midrange 
power.  Just something to help the driveability.

I would also like to improve the handling.  Anyone have any suggestions 
on shocks, sway bars, even whole handling kits, wheel and wider tire combos.
I've read all the tire info on the FAQ's and find it hard to believe that 
the general consesus is that a 185 tire is the best for the Vanagon.  I'm 
not looking for an autocrosser.  I just want a less &quot;swaying&quot; vehicle.

Thanx,

Perry
'87 Vanagon
