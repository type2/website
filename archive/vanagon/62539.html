Hello all, I'm trying to put together a set of reference books  for my 85 
Westy. I've bought the Bentley and yesterday looked at Muir's book for 
air-cooled VW's.
Would this book also be helpful for my wasserboxer? Also, Muir's book 
suggests getting his book on the Rabbit for later water-cooled Vanagons, 
however I was unable to find it.
Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks.....Harry (85 Westy)
