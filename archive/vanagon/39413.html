Subject: Oil Cooler under floor (was Re: oil question)

John,

I have had an external oil cooler installed under the floor of my '72 
bus. It is parallel to the floor.

As it was installed before my oil temp guage, I don't know what 
difference it made to engine temps. 

I'm planning on making a scoop from some softish metal alloy used for 
flashings in houses and to also fit a fan between the cooler and the 
floor to increase the air flow through the cooler. The fan will be switched
on by me rather than a thermostat.
