Subject:      Re: 84 Cooling System Problem

In the latter part of this summer I had raised levels of coolant in the
refill tank, and raised temperatures on the gauge. Not as extreme as yours,
but like a milder version. I have not actually lost any coolant.

Someone tells me that I may be getting exhaust gases leak from the head
gaskets into the cooling system. Sometimes the coolant level is
(permanently) a bit _low_ (ie I've somehow lost some), yet there is no pool
of coolant under the car. So maybe it is possible that there is a 2 way
exchange going on through the head gaskets.

My engine has done 80000+ miles since 1992.

Please let me know your conclusions.
