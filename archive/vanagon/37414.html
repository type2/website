&gt;&gt; When I push it down to that lowest
&gt;&gt;position, the wipers don't run and nothing else seems to happen
&gt;&gt;either.  What is it supposed to do?  Am I turning someone's wipers on
&gt;&gt;and off in South Africa?
&gt;
&gt;My '73 is the same. I always thought it could be for intermittent wipers
&gt;that my bus, being a cheapo no-frills 1600 version, didn't get. I know VW
SNIP 

&gt;You guys aren't by chance refering to the wash function, are you?  I know that
&gt;on later busses the hose from the windshield washer tank runs up to a valve
&gt;on the column and from there to the jets on the windshield.  If the washer
&gt;tank wasn't pressurized, then moving the lever wouldn't appear to do anything.
&gt;But I can't remember if this is the same lever as for the wipers, or a
&gt;different stalk.

Working from memory here, but on my 76 I believe the wash function is a pull
towards the steering wheel. I think, _but_am_not_sure_ the switch is
down for single wipe, up for slow, up once more for fast.

Don't trust this too much. I'm still trying to back my Tercel up be 
pushing the stick down, and the van has been put away for 5 months now!
Thats OK, in August, I'll still be trying to get the van into fifth gear;-)
