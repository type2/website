Eurobago (1995) Hits and Misses:
Please add your own comments!

After travelling for the first time in our Eurobago we made
comparions between the German and US converted Eurovan.

Hit:  Increased interior room makes it very comfortable compared
to the smaller eurovans.  There is still 2.5 feet to walk around
with when the bed is down.

Miss:  Stupid Norcold fridge wouldn't work on propane.  It would
also drain the auxiliary battery in an hour or so.  The german
eurovan's fridge we have run for days on the battery.

Hit:  Excellent ventilation.  Three sided screen in the canvas
that is attached to the roof allows much more air through the van
when still in bug proof mode.  Roof vent allows much of the heat
to escape when parked and cooking heat/vapours to escape.  The
wind out window behind the sink is good.

Miss:  Water system.  The pump is turned on by a switch and then
a knob is turn on at the sink to allow the water to flow.  This
means the pump is on when no water is being used and the pump
seems to be louder than before.  Plus, you can no longer see the
water tank.  It is hidden under the closet.

Hit:  Roof raises and closes better than the german conversion
due to the hydraulics.

Miss:  Cheap grey plastic interior such as plastic around
windows.  Not as good a view out of the rear side window since
the window is divided in half.  The lower part of the window
opens.  Additionally, the cheap plastic moulding makes viewing
area smaller.

Hit:  Milage was great!  I was worried that the bigger van would
suck a lot more gas.  Doing 80% highway we used 11.25 litres per
100 km.  Not bad for a 6,000 lbs beast.

Miss:  Sound system is horrible!  No bass.  Wimpy little speakers
in the cheap plastic interior rattle.  Could use some upgrading
ideas volks.

Hit:  Hardware for folding down the bed works very smoothly.  So
does the table hardware.

May bes:  The sterile blinds are easier to operate.  Storage area
seems to be about the same amount despite the larger size of the
van.  Must be taken up by the furnace and other stuff?  Some of
the small storage cupboards are very handy.  Furnace may be
useful in the cold or when wet.  Course, we have never needed it
before.

Biggest hit:  The extra space is amazing.  What a difference.  We
have started doing our aerobics inside the van.

Biggest miss:  The loss of a dream.  It is symbolized by the
stupid fridge.  It seems like you are suppose to plug your van
when camping losing the sense of self-sufficiency.  May be once
the fridge is fixed we will feel better about this.

PS....did we mention the fridge sucked.  Should be getting the van back today. 
 Please add you own impression.
