&gt;Just keep in mind that your gas milage can fluctuate quite a bit.  I
&gt;got 200 miles out of my first few tanks and figured if I always
&gt;gassed up at 150 I'd be OK.  Duh, the difference between nice
&gt;long trips on the highway in the fall and short trips in the winter
&gt;when it's 7 degrees F is a lot.  Let's just say one time I
&gt;put 10.4 gallons in my 10.6 gallon tank and since then have
&gt;been fueling up at 100 miles :-)

Well, OK, I don't go the log book way, what I do is fill up when it bottoms
on Reserve...  the only trouble with that method is remembering *how long*
it's been sitting at &quot;R&quot; .
Yes, Virginia, Your Mileage May Vary...
