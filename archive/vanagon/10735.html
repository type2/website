Subject:  Side doors popping open

 All 1987 vanagons were shipped with defective side door striker plates.
 After 65,000 miles of Arizona outback driving, the door pops open, and
 no amount of adjustment makes for a permanant fix.
 
 VW quitely improved the striker plate without a recall or telling anyone.
 The new plate works like a champ. The difference is a subtle stiffining
 ridge and boss. Plus a small nylon damper strip.
 
 Your door opening problem probably has nothing at all to do with electric
 locks. Instead, you probably still have the old plate, or else the
 nylon damper came off a newer one.
 
 This is a cheap part, but a VERY high torque phillips driver is needed.
