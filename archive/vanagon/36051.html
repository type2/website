Seems a bit high to me.  When I replaced the shocks in  the 84 Westie about 
4 months ago I paid $125 (including our 8.25% sales tax in Houston) for all 
4 shocks (GR-2's in the front and Gas-a-justs in the rear).

You may want to shop around.  Most of the VW specialty shops here in 
Houston were outragiously high (like ~$50/per) and would have to special 
order them.  I ended up buying them at BAP {manditory disclaimer:  I don't 
work there or have any interest in them other than they usually know what 
they are doing and often have the best prices in town (but not always)}. 
YMMV.
