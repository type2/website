'Haven't experienced this particular problem yet, but 
having just worked on our Jetta w/ central locking, I
might suggest that you take a look at the inside part
of the door lock where it connects to the actuator (the
motor that actually moves the locking rod up/down)and
see if moisture is getting in there causing a short.
Your doors are supposed to be pretty well sealed w/ a
plastic sheet covering the metal frame of the door.  
If it's still well sealed then you have to start looking
up where the glass slides between the rubber strips on
the way into the door and see if it's leaking onto the
inside of the doorlock or actuator.  Isn't WD40 supposed
to displace water?  Maybe you can try some on the lock/
actuator.

Good luck.
