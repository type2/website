So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; In regard to the following:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Oh, there are no Eurovans here in the States,
&gt; &gt;They are off on foriegn shores,
&gt; &gt;Driven round by high-priced whores...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I wish to take exception to the above quote....
&gt; 
&gt; FIRST: My Ex-wife DOES NOT live on foreign shores...
&gt; 
&gt; SECOND: She drives a Toyota...
&gt; 
&gt; My current wife and I, continue to live in the United States, and
&gt; continue to love and drive our EuroVan!
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I have made that correction, please continue....

You forgot to mention that you're not high-priced either....  ;p
