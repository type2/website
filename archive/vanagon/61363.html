Subject: Re: hoses for pipes

&lt;fwiw&gt;
i saw a 68 locally that had a pinto installed.  they'd run 1&quot; or 1.5&quot;
copper pipe the full length.  beaded it on the ends and sweated some street
ell's at the back to make the turn up into the engine compartment.  looked
pretty sanitary -- wonder how that would do in this case?
