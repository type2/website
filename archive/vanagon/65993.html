Subject:      Different tire sizes, 87 Vanagon

Hi,
I like to know if there is gonna be serious safety implications if I use
different tire sizes between the front and rear.

I have 215/60 14&quot; at all 4 corners now, I am thinking of putting 215/70
14&quot; sport utility tires at the back to improve traction in snow.
Thinking of the Dunlops Rovers or the Goodyear GS-A tires.

Any advice?
