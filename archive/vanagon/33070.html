&gt; As I continue on my odyssey of discovery on the peoples camper I find
&gt;  things on this pancake motor that seem, well, difficult. The most
&gt;  current displeasure is replacing the points, what sort of a magnetic
&gt;  contortionist to you have to be to get every thing setup right? Is
&gt;  there a secret 0 clearance right angle screwdriver I need? Do you pull
&gt;  the distributor to get to all the screws on the perimeter off the
&gt;  housing ie: the screw that holds the wire grommet in place is
&gt;  impossible to get to. And last - does a electronic point replacement
&gt;  system, like the Pertronix (?) unit work in this distributor?

    hi Perry !
to replace the points i loosen the distributor clamp (the one you have to
loosen to adjust the timing), then i can rotate the distributor into a
position where the grommet screw is actually accessible. after replacing the
points you wanna adjust the timing anyway, so you'd have to loosen that one
anyway. so this job is actually fairly easy. but you'll find plenty of other
opportunities to contort if you so desire (ever removed the alternator
in a type 4 ???).
to  and yes, i (and quite a few others on the list) have used the pertronix
ignitor electronic ignition for quite a while now, and i think they're happy
with it. i am, anyways...although we're currently meditating on the
significance of the weird dwell angle that you apparently get when putting
in this unit...
  keep contorting,
                    G.
