&gt;&gt; filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
&gt;&gt; weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
&gt;&gt; revolve!  Any others out there?


&gt;Know a guy a few years back who drove his brand new BMW 750 bike 200 miles
&gt;home from the dealer in 4th gear.  Didn't know it had 5th. His last one
&gt;didn't.  tim

My father did similar years ago on a holiday trip second day driving.
During talking to me he accelerates the Vanagon in fourth gear until we
reached the 110 km/h mark. This is the country road speed limit in
Germany including some maybe accepted additional speed. And he stayed
in the fourth for about 15 minutes until I asked him why. Then he
recognized and shifted to the fifth.

Maybe I have to tell that second to fifth are equal to first to fourth
of a four speed box.
