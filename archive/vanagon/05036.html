Subject: RE: No reverse Gear



There is also a little nylon and metal universal joint thingo on the end of the
selector shaft where it joins the gearbox selector shaft - may pay to check
this too (these are still available new).  If it is worn it could explain your
selection problems - esp. if it is reverse because of the twisting motion
required on the selector shaft...I once had HEAPS of trouble in sorting out a
reverse gear selection problem and it turned out to be this little sucker...

good luck

Rob K.
