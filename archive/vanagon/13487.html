Subject: A 90 Diesel? What the heck is this?

We don't got no 90 diesels in USA. This is the only 90 diesel I ever heard
of. Wow. 

Makes sense that you are posting from the UK. 

EXOTIC fellow on our list.

Now to get serious: what kind of manuals do you dudes over there in the UK
use? It must not be the Bentley manual that we got here in the USA, since
there is no Bentley manual here for your car.

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;My 1990 1700 Diesel has 60000 miles on the clock, had a new
&gt;head gasket done at 40k but now is running rough at tick over
&gt;when cold. If it were petrol the description I would give is
&gt;its missing, once the motor warms up its sort of OK but power
&gt;seems to be way down and she smokes like a campfire ! This problem
&gt;has become progressivly worse over the last few weeks. I have
&gt;put new glows in and at least she starts now. Also after a good
&gt;long high speed run I get sparks of burning soot from the exhaust.
&gt;Is this injectors or head gasket or what ?
&gt;Thanks in advance
&gt;1990 T2 1700D camper (leisuredrive)
