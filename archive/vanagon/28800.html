Subject: EV Mats

I'm running a bit behind in the &quot;incoming mail&quot; department, sorry all,  but
we avoid the rear mat problem with a small braided rug (MV), which seems to
work quite well. Yes, the rug clashes rather badly with the seats, but what
the heck....it stays put and collects collie hair quite well.....
