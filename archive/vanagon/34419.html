&gt;Hmmm. I remember seeing some TV program a few years ago about some

&gt;Basically he made a giant inflatable `Hamspter wheel' type affair

&gt;walked and walked....and the thing slowly bobbed its way across the

&gt;Surely all you need is a scaled up version, and you could *drive* your 
&gt;bus across??? ;)

And if this paddlewheel device was inflatable, then when you got
across little puddle, you could fold it up, stash it in the back, and
drive straight on to the bigger puddle!  Need a few extra gas tanks,
though, to get across either puddle.

And if you and your friends drove this trip in beetles, you could
have your very own own beetle puddle paddle battle muddle! :-) :-)
