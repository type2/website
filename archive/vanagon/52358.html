Subject: Re: Westfalia features!

&gt; filler extension tube on the Vanagon.  While camping at Yosemite a few
&gt; weeks ago I met a Westy owner who did not know that the front seats
&gt; revolve!  Any others out there?


Know a guy a few years back who drove his brand new BMW 750 bike 200 miles
home from the dealer in 4th gear.  Didn't know it had 5th. His last one
didn't.  tim
