listees ,
The roll over was complete !!!!!
That is to say that my bus just hit 200k  .
runs super well too, but  I have aquired a fine example of an '84 gti motor
and would like to install it in said van .
Any one know of a diesel van or drive line for parts ? preferably in the mid
atlantic or new england area ?
I travel that part of the country a lot to race bicycles. So I can arrange to
pick up stuff to save hassels of shipping .
Iheard a roumer of an all VW  junkyard in or near the Cambridge Oh. area. any
truth to this ?

heres to the next 200k
Mike
