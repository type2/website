I'm trying to lower the front end of my ' 70 Squareback and am &gt; having
trouble loosening the right side lower trailing arm from the splines &gt;
that hold it in.  I've tried pullers, heat, air hammers, crowbars, liquid
&gt; wrench, and nothing seems to break it free.  I'm pretty sure that there
is &gt; some rust keeping it from moving but this is getting ridiculous. The
last &gt; puller I tried I tightened it with a lot of torque, I measured it
with a &gt; torque wrench and it was 120 ft/lbs!!!!  Any help that anyone can
give me &gt; will be greatly appreciated!!!  Thanks. &gt; &gt; Derrick &gt; ' 70

You did not mention it, but did the left
side come off ok?  The last time I had a connection that I could not get
loose I used a butane torch and some WD-40.  I soaked it and then burned
the WD-40 off.  I did this quite a few times, until it finally came loose. 
I know this is not the ideal method for a grease filled front end but if
it is done carefully it may work.  Otherwise you could to remove the
entire front suspension and have it hot tanked at a radiator shop.  That
most likely will get that rust, and give you one hellofa clean front end.
