Subject: Need turn signal wiring info for '63

When I bought my '63 Deluxe, it had no wiring for the turn signals 
(in fact, no turn signal lever, either).  Now I have obtained a 
lever and want to wire it up.  Problem is, I can't find a wiring 
diagram that indicates which color wire goes where coming from the 
lever.  Both the Clymer manual and the reissued Bentley have black 
&amp; white wiring diagrams with no indication of what color each wire 
is.  If anyone has an older Bentley, or any wiring diagram that 
indicates which wire is which color, and could somehow send me the 
page that deals with the turn signals, I would be forever indebted 
to you.  I'm really not looking forward to trying to hook up that 
many wires on strictly a trial &amp; error basis!

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
