Subject: Westy Conversion source for Derek

Derek was asking for the source of the RV place in Mesa, AZ who (supposedly)
did the conversion of a 7passanger Syncro into a Westy in the stock style
for $600.00 US.

Guy Isley's RV Service Centers
2225 W. Main St.
Mesa, AZ 
85201
(602) 834-1234

As I mentioned to Derek in a private thread I am under the impression that
this was for fabbing the roof cuts, rolling the &quot;cut&quot; edge and mounting of
the existing fiberglass Westy top(s). I question if it even included match
painting etc.
