Subject: Re: engine transplants



diesels have a different bellhousing from gas,  that's about as far as I can
go.  The 091/1 4spd. trans was in both air and H2O vanagons, diesels got
five speeds (sometimes)  Syncros have 094-4WD.
^^^^^^^^^^^


Anybody know if it is possible to put one of these five-speeds, in
an '81 Vanagon, to mate with the original '81 Vanagon gas engine?
