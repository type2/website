Hello vanagon people,
I just would like to say that my vanagon turned 100K yesterday (at the corner
of 8th and Main in Bozeman, for what it's worth).  It would not have been
able to do it without such fine help as I have had from this list, Mark
Johnson and my friend Keith who does lots of work on it with me!  Thanks.

On a second note:  propane regulators seem to still exist which can be
installed on the vanagons.  (Mine is a 1982 diesel camper).  They are 2
stage regulators and seem to require a bit of tube bending but the gas 
people told me yesterday there should be no problem with using them.
The vent on my regulator points forward and has become grimy with dirt.
The gas people told me I can't clean it at a car wash because this will put
water into it.  Till I decide to get a new regulator, I am going to try
to clean it with alcohol and compressed air.  Since methyl alcohol is inserted
inside the tank as a line drier, I think that it should be ok to use as a
cleaner on the outside.

If anyone else has cleaned their regulators, I'd appreciate hearing about it.
Stuart Hutton
