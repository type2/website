Subject: Lowest only counts in car lots

What's all the bragging about lowest mileage???? We use our 86 BusPlus,
&quot;Ibarra&quot; for trvel: Brooks Range of Alaska, Rockies from Colorado to Jasper
Canada, Nova Scotia/PEI, many trips to tip of Baja from home base of Santa
Rosa, CA. We've put 82K miles on it since purchase in late 1990, almost all
road cruises. I'm proud of where Ibarra's taken us. Low miles would be a
good &quot;add-on&quot; at this point, but I'd rather have the experiences! Right?
Right!
