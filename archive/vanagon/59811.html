&gt; Greetings all- just got my new 83 home. I thank all of you for your
advice and comments. I had originally been looking for a bread loaf van,
but due to your enthusiasm here I began to look for a vanagon and I am
really happy I did.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a few questions for you all:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) the EGR light is on. how can I reset this?

Congratulations on your purchase.  To reset the EGR light, follow the
speedometer cable from the left front wheel up to a black box mounted on
the frame near the spare tire carrier.  On this black box is a white
button.  Push the button until it clicks, and your EGR light will stay off
for another 15,000 miles.

&gt; 
&gt; 2) my vanagon was equipped with the auxiliary gas heater. Are these safe?
It works VERY well.
&gt; 
&gt;From what I've heard, they're safe.  If your van is air-cooled, you will
have an Eberspacher BA-6 heater.  The Eberspachers apparently have many
safeguards to keep the things from blowing up/catching fire.

&gt; 3) how does one remove the bulbs that light the dash? (specifically the
speedo). I get the white thingy out but the bulb is not standard and I do
not want to force it.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) The van seems to cruise well at up to 65-70 mph. What is the
recommended cruise speed? what is the maximum speed?
&gt; 
Is your van air-cooled?  If so, I usually cruise my '81 air-cooled around
65, but I want it to last so I don't push it too hard.

&gt; 5) Are the brake components the same as later breadloaves? (calipers,
drums, rotors, pads?)
&gt; 
Hmm, good question.  The rear drums are probably the same, but the rotors
aren't.  Buses have rotors with studs for lug nuts while Vanagons have lug
bolts that thread into holes in the rotor.  I don't know about calipers.
