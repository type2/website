I have an interesting problem with my 87 syncro. Upon startup, it runs
fine.  when restarting, if the thing has not cooled completely, it will
barely run.  After the temp gauge gets past about 1/4 or so, it returns to
running fine.  Seeing that the problem is temperature related, my
suspicions are turning toward temperature sender problems.  Also, the
tailpipe is black and sooty, leading me to believe the mixture is rich as
well.

Any ideas??
