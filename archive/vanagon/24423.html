Subject: Re: _V_O_L_K_W_A_G_E_N_ emblem removal

     &gt;I'm about to repaint the back hatch of my '72 Bus, and I'm wondering 
     &gt;how and if I may safely remove the _V_O_L_K_S_W_A_G_E_N_ emblem 
     &gt;that's there for subsequent post-paintjob replacement. I tried prying 
     &gt;off the inside of the hatch for an internal shot, but succeeded only 
     &gt;in leaving marks on that panel. If it snapped on/in to the hatch at 
     &gt;one point, I fear that the snaps are corroded. Anyone done this 
     &gt;before? Any advice is appreciated!
     
     nasty job, 
     
     The badge is held on with 4 round spring clips. The posts that come 
     out of the badge are really tine like 2mm diameter and they almost 
     always snap off the badge it you try to lever the spring clips off.
     
     I guess the only way might be to try and break the spring clips in 
     half so that they just fall off the badge posts.
     
     I fitted a brand new badge to my bus and actually threaded the posts 
     down with an 8 BA die, then put little 8 BA nuts in place of the 
     spring clips.
