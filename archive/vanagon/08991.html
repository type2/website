Subject: Allow me to Introduce Myself
Date: Fri, 30 Dec 94 11:15:27 MST

Inasmuch as this is Friday, and I understand we get a bit
lighter on Fridays, let me introduce myself.

My dad bought a '69 bug (119 210 896) in April 1969. I really
wasn't pleased at the time (I was in fourth grade) because he
got rid of our '59 Ford Fairlane at that time. He paid about
2050.00 new for it(I still have the invoice). He used it to
drive the freeways of SoCal and put quite a few miles on it.
I learned how to change oil, scrub whitewalls, &amp;c on that car.
I ended up driving it pretty much all the time by the time
I was a senior in high school; got into my first fender-bender
in it, learned how to scrounge junkyards and bolt on new fenders
and hood, &amp;c....

Dad bought a Honda Accord in about '78 and I got the bug when
I was a sophomore at the University of Arizona. I lived pretty
close to campus, so a tank of gas lasted about 2 weeks, and for
a time, I could fill up and get change back from a fiver.  It had
about 150K miles on it by then, and was on its second engine (it
ate #3 exhaust on Dad), but it was my first car of my very own and
I loved it like life itself.

After college, I moved from Tucson to Anchorage, and drove my bug
up to Prince Rupert, BC, took the ferry to Haines, AK and drove the
rest of the way.  Dad was kinda petrified that I would drive that
little old car all that way, but the only trouble I had on the 
trip was that it rained for about 3 days, the windshield wiper
on the driver side would stick, and I cracked the windshield trying
to unstick it.  I drove that in Alaska for a couple of years, 
enjoying the joys of having an air-cooled car in Alaska.  We had 
taken off the thermostat, flaps, and replaced the oil-bath air
cleaner with a paper element cleaner which had no provision for
the carb preheat, so part of my winter routine was de-icing the
carb so the throttle wouldn't stick.  I had an electric plug-in
in my parking space, connected to a switch on my bedroom wall,
so I bought an electric heater and put it behind the back seat,
and when I got up in the morning, I'd have a warm car, as long
as I only drove the 4 miles to work.  Otherwise, I'd be peering
through the clear spot in the lower left corner of the windshield.

Anyway, Fritz was getting old, having a hard time getting up the
hills, when I got seduced by a Datsun 210 that a friend was selling.
I know, but I was young and foolish, and besides, it had a heater.
I stored Fritz down at the Alaska Railroad yards for awhile, then
gave it to a friend whose car got totalled. It had about 211K miles
on it then, in the Spring of '84. It may be still tooling around
somewhere, though I doubt it.  May it rest in peace.

I packed up the Datsun and my new wife and moved back to Arizona.
I never really had good karma with the Datsun.  I bought a couple
of motorcycles and commuted on them almost exclusivly for about
five years, but something was still missing.

In late '89 I got this itching to get a VW bus -- something I think
I wanted since I drove a friend's brand-new '73 at a high school
band car wash.  I kept my eye out, but everyone that I saw on
used car lots were stripped and carpeted, or otherwise in bad shape.

Then one Saturday morning, I picked up the paper and found a '71
Campmobile for sale for $1550.  I never really considered a 
camper, but this guy had bought it about a year before, put a
rebuilt transmission and Japanese (?) tires on it, took it out
for a summer, and discovered his wife didn't like camping.  I
made a cursory inspection, drove it around the block, and then
we drove to the bank and I bought it and took it home.

The bus (231 2202 122) and I have been together now for almost
5 years. I've had the engine out 4 times, replaced it once, done
generator, starter, power brake booster, shocks, tires, &amp;c &amp;c.
I've learned to live with its quirks, such as the fact  that 
the gas gauge won't go down past 1/4 (a fact I learned the hard
way one Saturday night 17 miles south of Gila Bend), you have to
jiggle the headlight switch to get the lights to stay on, if you
are meeting someone in the mountains, you leave an hour before anyone
else and they'll pass you halfway up, &amp;c. (I did pass someone
once going up the hill -- a wrecker towing a Winnebego!).  It
has also served as my lunchroom -- I'll go out, set up the
table, read the paper, eat lunch, and have a smoke.

My wife puts up with us (her dad had a '63, I think, and it was
always blowing up or catching fire, if you believe her stories),
my five-year-old daughter loves &quot;Daddybus&quot; (except when he runs
out of gas on the freeway .. it took me a while to learn my lesson
I should have learned south of Gila Bend).  Right now, I'm just
trying to keep it running until I can get Historic Vehicle plates
for it, but I have a feeling I will try and keep it going until
it gets munched or I can't get parts anymore.

I apologize for taking up this much bandwidth - I guess I tend
to prattle on....Anyway, I live about 20 miles E. of Phoenix,
commute 60+ miles a day in the bus, and carry more spares
than is healthy!

Happy New Year, everyone!
