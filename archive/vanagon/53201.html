Subject: Re: Jetta vibration damper

&gt; Non Vanagon contents: A mechanics told me that my Jetta 91 is suppose to
&gt; have an anti-vibration device (sort of rubber/steel weight) under to engine
&gt; to reduce the noise over 3000RPM. Is someone knows the first year of this
&gt; device (I think that the dealer remove this part without asking me :-( )

I remember reading about this coming out in the cabriolet in the
early 90s I think, something to do with some unusual resonances due
to structural changes in the cabrio. I haven't seen one, and there's 
no mention of it in the Bentley, but that doesn't mean it didn't have 
it... Maybe try going to a different dealer &amp; ask to order the 
part - if it was there, it should show up on the fiche.
