Subject: '67 Resto from Hell update... (short)

Gotta keep it short due to exceptionally busy schedule.

Spent Saturday at the Paint Shop from Hell.   Set the spring plates,
insalled  the tranny, etc and did a bunch of other UFO last minute tasks.
Met the former neighbor flatbed tow truck driver at the paint shop early
Sunday morning. FINALLY yanked the resto home and plced it in its new home.
Just like bringing the new puppy home and showing it the dog house. Here
puppy, puppy!... =))))).

Installed new wiring harness that was yanked out of a junkyard bus for
$30.00 (about a year ago, thank you!). Some kid had just installed it and
then munched the donor bus. Spent the day hooking up wires. This is always
tons o' fun.

19 months and $0, 000.00 at the SECOND paint shop not bad...

Gotta fly!
