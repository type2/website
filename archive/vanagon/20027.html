Subject: Re: '87 westy surging ?

&gt;My wasserboxer motor is surging at idle.  I think I remember reading about
&gt;this problem on the list before so I will try the archives.  Meanwhile if
&gt;any of you have a clue as to what is happening the help would be welcome.
&gt;The symtoms are constant surging between 900 and 1200 rpm after hot and at
&gt;at idle.  When driving all seems fine.  I have run some fuel injector
&gt;cleaner through a tank of gas and that had no effect.  Could there be
&gt;an air leak somewhere ?  Hoping for a simple solution  (:-)
&gt;
hey Frank, I had the EXACT problem with my '85 and it drove me and a few
mechanics crazy.  It was the trottle switch, if that's waht it's
called...the thingy on top that revs the engine when you turn it by
hand...was lose.  A smart mechanic up here 'cleaned the trottle body and
rebushed it'.  Idle's as stable as a mountain now, never a surge since
after 10,000K. Hope it's that simple and good luck, Bruce
