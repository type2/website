Subject: DIRT CHEAP vanagons (1 Westy) in Pittsburgh.
Date: Wed, 5 Jun 1996 13:25:28 -0400

Help me out!   I bought two project Vanagons last year, intending to make
one good one out of them.  To make a long story short, my health has
deteriorated (diagnosed with MS), I bought a project house, and I have
no time or room for the Vanagons (my new garage is too low for a Westy).

My loss is your gain!

If anyone out there can haul these puppies off SOON, they're the next
best thing to being free (how about $500 for the pair?).  They're in the
garage/parking lot of my old apartment, and must be moved soon before the
landlady hoses me.

They are: a 1981 Westy.  About 40,000 (yes, that's actual) miles; less than
1000 on a rebuilt motor.  Wrecked front end.  All camping stuff intact and
pretty nice.

And: 1980 Vanagon GL.  About 50,000 miles (again, accurate as far as I know).
Automatic transmission.  Air conditioning (removed).  Pretty much gutted
inside.  This was the good body that I was going to transform into a Westy
using all the bits from the above vehicle.  I have all the seats, etc, from
this one that MUST go with the van.

I need to divest myself of these projects very soon.  The sooner someone
can haul these off, the better price they can negotiate.

Please, respond soon.  Call me at my office (412) 268-7689, or send email.

Thanks,
--Dale
