Subject: Re: Rolling Stone VWUS/Jerry Garcia Ad

&gt;While at the Lawrence, MA VW show Sunday, I overheard a conversation
&gt;regarding an ad in the next issue of the Rolling Stone from VW US.
&gt;
&gt;Aparently its a line drawing of the front of a Splittie with a tear
&gt;rolling out of one side windshield and underneath &quot;Jerry Garcia 1942-1995&quot;.
&gt;I just went down to the bookstore on campus, and its not in the 9/7 issue
&gt;of RS....so it will probably be in the next issue.

i have seen the ad already, it is as you describe. the line drawing is in
b&amp;w and the tear in acquamarine blue (L number ;) ??)

anyways a very wise p.r. move of VW's IMHO. The Grateful Dead wrote the
book on mass merchandising, so perhaps VWOA could learn a thing or three :)
