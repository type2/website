Subject: The maiden voyage


Sunday my wife and I are starting on our first long journey (2000 miles) in 
our 73' westy (77' 2.0) and I am making some preliminary changes to make it 
ride better.

On corners it seems to be very top heavy and it sways to and fro, if I 
were to invest in some truck tires that can handle a double load will 
this help?  I need new front tires and possibly shocks, though tires are 
priority.

The person I bought the bus from took out the second aux. battery that 
sits under the bench seat.  He also took the rely thing from the engin 
compartment.  Could I put a second battery in without the rely thing?  It 
seems that it might over tax the altinator (sp).  Does the rely thing 
switch the recharge/use to where it is needed (ie. interior lights, 
fridge, to starter, headlights)?

I also sent away for a VDO oil temp gauge and a oil pressure gauge from 
Rocky Mountain parts.  I had two choices on the temp gauge and I chose 
the one that replaces the dip stick (vs the one that I would need to 
drill into the block)  Is there a big difference between the two?  I hope 
I didn't make the wrong decision.  Is it hard to install the pressure 
gauge, by hard I mean is there any drilling etc.  These are needed 
because we will be driving first to Indianapolis, Indiana then on to New 
Mexico and it will be hot.  

That brings me to my last question.  When driving for long hours in 
scorching heat is there anything I can do to increase cooling or decrease 
the heat in my motor?  Is it possible to keep a steady 70 MPH in that 
heat?

Thanks for any help you can give me.
I'm a bit anxious about this trip.  With a recently rebuilt engin, new 
bus.
By the way, what should I put in my road kit?
