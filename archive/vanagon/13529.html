Subject: re: optimal warmup time


	Warm-up time. A question which will *never* be definitively 
answered, in my opinion. Nobody has any kind of controlled data on 
this subject- it's all anecdotal.

	Before sharing *my* anecdotes, remember I live near 
San Francisco. Winter overnight low temps average 30s-low 40s deg F, 
summertime lows are around 50s-low 60s deg F. If you live where it 
gets *really cold* that's probably different!
	
	That said: I *don't* warm up my water-cooled VW's. Yep, I drive 
them gently until the temp comes up. But no &quot;warm-up&quot; period.

	Pretty much the same for my Beetle. When I was a kid my ol' man 
had a '68 Bus and a '64 Porsche 356C, neither of which got &quot;warmed 
up&quot;- dad just started the car, and drove gently at first. And those 
engines lived long, full lives. That was here in the San Francisco 
area also, BTW.

	Free advice is worth every penny you pay!

	Happy Motoring,
