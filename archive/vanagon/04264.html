I heard the exact same thing from some mechanic down in New Mexico. But I
also heard from a chief VW mechanic in Flagstaff, Arizona, that putting
anything else but 87 in your fuel tank was a waste of money. 

So, who's right? I don't know. There is a confusion, however, I would like
to get out of the way: in Europe, regular gasoline (essence normale or
Normalbenzin) is rated at 91, while super is rated at 98. Apparently,
octane is measured differently here and there. Something about (R+M)/2 and
RON, but I'm not sure what that means. Or SAE vs. DIN standards. In any
event, when VW manuals were translated for the North American public, they
erred by assuming that 91=91. Ja?
