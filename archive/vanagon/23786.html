Subject: Re: 6v fuel guage in 12v bu

                      RE&gt;&gt;6v fuel guage in 12v bus                 8/29/95

OK (Sigh) here we go - one more time:

1)  Ohm's Law :  Volts - (amps) X (ohms)

2)  The current needed to generate deflection from empty to full of the gauge
requires a range of current that is determined by the construction ( fixed
resistance) of the gauge, 0 amps at empty, and some FIXED number at full.

3)  On the original 6 volts, the original  resistance of the sender unit in
the tank  provided the correct current swing between full and empty for a 6
volt system and the original gauge.

4)  If you double the applied voltage to 12 volts from 6, and don't change
anything else,  in dutiful obedience to Ohm's law, the current swing will
double and the gauge will always read higher that the fuel level in the tank
really is.

5) To make things right after changing the applied voltage from 6 =&gt; 12, you
either double the resistance of the sending unit or find a gauge with twice
the current draw of the original.

Harvey
