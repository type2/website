Subject:      Buses around the Buoy

What a great first experience for B and I with a VW group at Buses by the
Buoy.  There were 54 vans ranging from '65 to '97 camping in Hidden Pines
Campground in Old Orchard Beach this weekend.  We were pleased to attend it
, thanks to Ric Golen for suggesting we attend.

The program was structured to the newbies like us.  We could meet people at
breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Then in between the boat trips and campfires
was more time to chat...four Eurovans make up an army in these
circumstances. Can you all just imagine 36 vans caravaning thru a resort
town like Old Orchard Beach?  It must have been a half mile of three
generations of Volkswagen.  Great introduction for us to LiMBO and VVO groups.

Now we need a group of maybe four to tour with.

Wish you were here, Gary
