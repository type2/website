Like I said, all the beautiful vehicles... Well, Dave I hate to break it to
you but the nicest piece of vehicular gear you brought along was the drawer
from the van (in that &quot;je ne sais crois&quot; vivid woodgrain that we all know
and love) full of camping supplies.  Ya just can't go camping without a
little piece of the VW experience.  IMHO.
