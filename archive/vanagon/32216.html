Subject: Re: db&amp;HVWs dyno tests (www)


Regarding the DB&amp;HVW dyno tests, I saw no mention of wear-in cycles but the
fact the GEX engine needed a valve job came across loud and clear.  

I think it would be of more service to their readers if such magazines
followed-up on their Gee-Whiz articles a year or two later, telling us how
their engines stood up to normal service and what kind of mileage they got.
 In most cases their 'projects' are not even street-legal, let along
practical to build or drive. 

With Jap bikes developing one hp per cubic centimeter, pulling 200 hp out of
a 2000cc engine falls into the 'So what?' catagory.  But run the engine for a
hundred thousand miles and it may be an article worth reading.

Dyno testing is lots of fun but those suckers don't handle very well in
traffic :-)
