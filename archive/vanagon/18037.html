My problem is getting really, really annoying. 
Here are the symptoms:
It dies when it gets warm.  I go about a block and then when the engine
revs high, it looses power, and dies at the first opportunity.
I push the van home (It's only a block), and then the van won't start for
a few days.  Most recently, it started after I screwed with the points,
but they seem o.k., and it won't start now.
What could make it die like this?  Can the cold start valve/thermo time
switch do that if it's bad?  Is it the brain?  What else?

BTW, it's a '77 bus with a 2000 cc engine.

grr.

Gee- sounds like its going lean- running high and then losing power.
Is there a warm-up regulator that modifies fuel pressure or injector
mapping after the engine warms up? I bought a fuel pressure gauge to 
check my 914 years ago- wanna borrow it? If you can't find one where you
are I could probably mail you mine for about $5 and you could mail it
back when you were done with it.
Have you got gas in the tank? 
Have you got rust, crud and corruption blocking the line out of
the gas tank? 
Changed the fuel filter recently? 
Does the fuel pump deliver enough fuel? 
Is there an auxilary air regulator that's not closing when the
richened start-up mixture leans out? 
Are all the injectors spraying correctly?
