Subject:       Today's Puzzler...

Okay electrical gurus, here's a good one:
On my '87, the wipers run fine but they do not auto-park... EXCEPT 
when on intermittent duty!  I know about the contact points inside 
the cover of the wiper motor but I'm hesitating to get to them as the 
cover seems to be riveted on, not screwed (well, maybe I'M
screwed :(  ).  

My thinking is this-- if the wipers park on intermittent mode, is it 
really those contacts inside the motor case?  What I'm REALLY getting 
at is there an 'easy' fix ie.  someone to tell me &quot;Oh yeah, the brown 
wire next to the ____ has fallen off.&quot; 

TIA - Digest Dan (direct emails drooled over)
