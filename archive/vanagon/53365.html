 &gt;&gt; Sticking to non-philosophical points, where did you get your new wheel
covers, and how much it did set you back if you don't mind me asking? &lt;&lt;

 Though my goal was to ponder the loftier complexities of the cosmos (and that
goal has been acheived, thanks to Gregory Mitch Daughtry) I'll tell you where
I got the gen-un-wine wheel covers.  Got 'em right here on the list.  I asked,
and a fellow lister replied with a set he'd taken off his '86 when he switched
to alloys. Can't remember the fellow's name (that thread long erased) but I
paid $46 for them. Understand:  I sent a *check* to a complete stranger and
he, trusting another complete stranger, boxed up the wheel covers and UPS'd
them to me *without* even waiting for the check to appear!  This episode could
easily be labeled &quot;Karma 101&quot; with no argument from the gods.
