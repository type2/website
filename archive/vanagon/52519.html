Subject: 83 x-over or collector pipe?

Anyone know what the exhaust pipe is called that goes from the exhaust
manifold to the catalytic convertor on the Westy air-cooled Federal model
Westy? On the door is the date 8/82. Is this the early or late model 83? The
pipe comes from the two manifolds and bends 180 degrees to meet the connector
for the catylitic convertor. Each of the manifold connectors are triangular
shaped having three holes for the bolts that connect it to the manifold.
Likewise, the connection to the c/c has a simillar connection. There is a
bolt sticking out of the bend like a &quot;clean-out plug&quot;. And on the right side
of the pipe is a welded on bracket for the bolt that holds the mufffler up
near the tail pipe. The Orlando dealer does not list the part no. as it is no
longer available. I sure would appreciate getting the correct one as most
parts houses seem to be far from here. Thanks. Bob. If you represent a parts
house, please fax me at 407-896-1243. Thanks again.
