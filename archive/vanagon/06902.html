&gt; well ... most education is never really a millstone or albatross. :)
&gt; it might be worthless in the long run (as in: with my phd, army medals
&gt; and a dollar, i can get a cup of coffee) ... but the experience of getting
&gt; any education or training is always of value. sometimes you learn what to
&gt; do. sometimes you learn what NOT to do.

Well, it seems that the only thing I learned after getting the phd was God!
Don't do that again. But, I had already done it by then and so ... back
to the stone.  On the other hand, I couldn't pull my camper with my phd
degree where-as with the truck, I can.
