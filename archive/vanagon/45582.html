Subject: HELP! '64 ignition shot?

Here's the story:
I've had a couple of instances on my '64 (6 volt) when I turn on the 
headlights and the engine dies in mid-flight. I just figured it was because it 
was still 6-volt and the headlights require a lot of juice. I've also had a 
couple times when I put the key in, turned it and nothing happened. I usually 
just turn it all the way back and try again and (for some reason) it works. 
Well the other night coming home at about midnight, I put the key in and 
started it. While it was warming up I turned on the lights and the engine 
died. When I tried to restart it, it wouldn't start, I got no dash lights at 
all and realized I had no power at all (no headlights, radio, interior lights 
etc). Upon consulting Muir, I checked the fuses (fine), figured the ignition 
switch must be shot, hotwired it and drove it home. With the hotwire on, 
everything operated fine. Next day I swithed out the ignition switch with the 
one I had leftover from my '60 splittie (R.I.P.) with NO LUCK! I have no 
reason to believe that the '60 ignition switch should be dead and I still have 
no dash lights and no electrical power anywhere. The fuses all appear fine. 
Tried to get a new ignition switch, went to two places, niether one had one 
and both said the chance of BOTH switches being dead are pretty slim. Muir 
says it should be the switch or the fuses. 

Any ideas? Would a bad switch kill ALL electricity? Are '60 and '64 switches 
incompatible? What am I missing?

Thanks,

--Jonny
