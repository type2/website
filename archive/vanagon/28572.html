Subject:       the moral flame


What's the deal with this list lately?  First T&amp;A, now the relative 
morality of Oil companies?  One of the first things I learned in the 
real world was that no one can ever be convinced of somthing they 
don't want to believe.  No one is gonna change anyone's mind.  IMHO, 
we've done enough polarization with our society, and it sucks.  Wanna 
debate?  Wanna argue?  Go ahead.  On a debate/argue list.  I'm sure 
there's one out here.  Go find it, and tear the hell out of each 
other.   
    I have a bus, and I like my bus, and I'd love 
to share what I know about it, and get help when I need it.  This 
list is a magnificent asset.  If, however, every other message is some 
yahoo hollering down at me form his conservative/liberal/(insert your 
dogma here) high horse, I'm sorry, but I would rather not be a part 
of it all.      

What are we all doing?  9/10 of a bus is the vibe.  

PS--don't bother to flame me.  I could care less if someone has a 
problem with anything I say/do/believe.
