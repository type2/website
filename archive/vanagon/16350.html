Subject: Re: EAST COAST GATHERING [maybe?]


As I've mentioned before, for some of us in NY, New England, and from
the more Eastern Reaches of the Great White North....there is the
Ben &amp; Jerry's Volkswagen Van Show which is usually held in Vermont
in Mid-June. I don't have the date yet...but I suppose when the
next propaganda sheet from LiMBO comes out it should be listed.

Howaboutit?
