Subject: Brick Trek

Seems a shame to have all those cubic feet moving across America just carrying
a few smiling people.  Isn't there some light, bulky, valuable commodity that
needs to be shipped, so that the Trek could make a profit?  Maybe that many
flat noses doing 60mph could alter the weather, bring rain to drought-stricken
parts of the country.
