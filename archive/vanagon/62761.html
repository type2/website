Found in Saturday's Grass Valley paper, The Union -
Grass Valley is about 50 miles from Sacramento

'78 VW Westfalia, Orig. needs eng work. $1200 916-268-0249

Remember there is still a '81 Westi with engine in pieces for $800 
obo, 916-273-1818

Both of these could be good deals.

And no, I don't know if either of them ae currently parked on 
carpeted driveways!
