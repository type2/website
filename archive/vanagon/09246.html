Ahhh, Nuts!!

I have concluded after closer examination of the oil I drained from the
engine yesterday that I am indeed looking at millions of suspended
aluminum particles.  Aluminum, because none have attached themselves to
my magnetic drain plug.

Now, wouldn't that exclude rods or bearings from being suspect?
