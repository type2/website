Subject: Re: Anyone need '53? parts

A local salvage yard employee informed me about 6 weeks ago that he had 
purchased a '54 23-window Deluxe that he found out in a field somewhere 
(lucky S.O.B.).  He plans to drag it in an sell it (probably to someone 
in Japan) and, as of yet, I haven't seen it.  He says it is complete 
except for the missing tranny and motor.  This project is beyond my scope 
(read: money), but whoever takes it on could probably use that tranny and 
the 16-inch wheels.  I'm trying to get him to drag it to our VW car show 
(June Bug Jamboree, Springfield, MO, June 17th), so I'll keep you posted 
on its location and *true* condition when I finally get to see it.  (I'll 
probably have by picture taken with it and fib to my grandkids that it 
was mine)  ;)

&gt; The local bug guy just took in an ancient bus, I'm guessing
&gt; a '53, it is/was a panel (now has a big round window in the
&gt; side) nothing inside it, barndoor hatch gone, engine long
&gt; gone, GAS TANK AND CAP still hanging there in the engine
&gt; compartment and look quite OK for their age, nothing inside
&gt; the rear of the bus, front seat frames present, 3-spoke banjo
&gt; style steering wheel present (black) and in OK condition,
&gt; gauge panel gone, most knobs gone from that funny early style
&gt; dash, steering box and column still attached to that old
&gt; wheel, front axle present, all 4 16&quot; wheels present, there
&gt; is a tranny hanging in it, as to it's origionality who knows?
&gt; Whole thing is mucho rough and probably not near rebuildable
&gt; at any cost, I didn't check to see if any lights/signals were
&gt; present, didn't think about it, if anyone has any needs, mail
&gt; me with specifics and I'll go check it out.
