On the question of water heated boxes: could you not use a fluid with
an extremely high boiling temperature? didn't someone make water
heated boxes? (even one would be efficient, yes?);
 
I am toying with the idea of using oil heat coupled with a fan and
would like to see the FIAT set up on this. If the lines run to the
back and are integrated directly into the rearmost pipes then low
pressure should not be a problem.
