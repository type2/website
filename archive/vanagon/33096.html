Subject: Re: Mineral to Synthetic?

In a message dated 96-01-17 19:47:32 EST, you write:

&gt;I would leave the mineral in for the first 5,000 miles, change it once after
&gt;1,000 miles to get rid of any oil shavings, then again after another 2,500
&gt;miles to get rid of the rest of them.  At 5,000 miles change to Castrol
&gt;Syntec 5W50 and use it year round unless you live in a really severe (cold)
&gt;climate.  5W50 may even perform well in really cold weather since it is such
&gt;a wider range viscosity.  I change mine every 5,000 miles in the Vanagon and
&gt;changed it every 7,500 in the Jetta.  I would never leave regular oil in the
&gt;cranckase this long but the Jetta survived quite well with this schedule.
&gt;
&gt;

Thanks!  What do you consider the benifits of synthetic?  I'm wondering if
the justification is worth the extra expense.  Does it break down like
mineral does when its subjected to heat?  How does it affect compression
compared to mineral?
