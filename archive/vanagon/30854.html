Subject: Bad Tool, bad, bad, tool.

To All:

So I'm out there a'banging away, putting a stub axle of a gear reduction unit
together when the copper-headed hammer flys apart.  Literally.  The head of
the hammer shattered and the little biscuit of copper -- weighs about a pound
-- comes flying off and damn near hits me in the eye.

New hammer.  Bought from Harbor Freight.  

Pick up the pieces and can't believe what I find.  The head of the hammer is
CAST IRON.  The copper biscuits are just stuck on, recesses mebbe a
quarter-inch deep to hold them.  But that sonofabitch is CAST IRON!

Cast iron is fragmiable.  It shatters.  Copper is mallable.  It bulges.  Put
copper in a cast iron ring, pound on it and the copper will swell, the cast
iron will shatter and you're liable to kill someone.

What kind of a mentally retarded SOB would design such a thing?  Better
still, what sort of person would sell it?  

Pittsburg Tools &amp; Harbor Freight.

Buyer Beware can only go so far.  Offer a tool as a hammer and if it looks
like a hammer and feels like a hammer it's really stretching things to expect
the buyer to run a metallurgical test to see if its really suitable as
hammer.

Yeah, I wrote the company.  But why is it that I got this feeling we'll still
see this piece of crap in their catalog ten years from now?  Anyone with a
lick of sense knows better than to sell a CAST IRON hammer, so if they're
selling the things it's a good bet you'd have to hit them over the head with
a squadron of lawyers to get their attention.

This is a dangerous tool, fellers.  If you got one, throw it away, cuz it
won't give you any warning before it tries to kill you.
