Subject: Sliding Door Step wanted

I too am looking for a sliding door step or running board if you prefer,
for our '85 Westy.

It kills me to think my '72 went to the bone yard in '87 with a perfect
one but then again I wasn't into VWs back then, just a mode of
transportation for a family of 7!

Thanks for any information in advance
Wendy
'85 Westy  &quot;S-Cape&quot;
