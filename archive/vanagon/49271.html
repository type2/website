&gt; Hi Volks, I am looking into buying a '87 GL to upgrade to the larger engine,
&gt; power steering, and A/C which my '84 doesnt have. the body is very straight ,
&gt; paint good, and has the optional &quot;sport stripe&quot; kit ( wowee!!) and those neat
&gt; &quot;carat&quot; alloy wheels. the price is very reasonable, I think, ($ 2300),  but
&gt; there are a few drawbacks. First is that  the odometer reads 157k. At this kind
&gt; of mileage I am sure the head gaskets have been replaced, but the current
&gt; owners,( very short term that is,) don't have any repair records. How many of
&gt; you 2.1 liter wasserboxer owners out there have this kind of mileage or more on
&gt; your engines? What is the average interval for head gaskets? My '84 which has
&gt; 110k on it had the head gaskets replaced at 80k by the PO. What other problems
&gt; should I look for on a hi mileage van? The second problem is that the shifter
&gt; linkage is messed up and I cant get it in gear, but I have a friend who had the
&gt; same problem with his van and it was just the shift linkage,and not a problem w/
&gt; the tranny. I ran It for a while and the coolant light did not come on so I
&gt; guess this is a plus.    
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice would be appreciated ASAP as iI'm going down to look at it again this
&gt; evening and go over it w/ a fine toothed comb. 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks

      The reason you can't get it in gear maybe the clutch is not
      disengaging!

                           Check the clutch good!
