Subject: Re: Towing a Bus

SNIP!

&gt;Those nylon tow straps are nice.  They cost about $20 or so.  When the towee
&gt;spaces out for a few seconds and the strap slackens, it doesn't usually jerk
&gt;that much when the strap is tightened again (the strap stretches).  The bus
&gt;has little loops welded to the front of the frame intended for towing use.
&gt;If towing with another VW, don't wrap the strap around the bumper.  The
&gt;towee should try to do the braking for both vehicles.  It doesn't hurt to
&gt;write (with white shoe polish) on the rear window of the towee's vehicle,
&gt;&quot;CAR IN TOW.&quot;  If you live down South, or somewhere where most of the
&gt;residents can't read, this might not help.
&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't try this in city or freeway driving, but out in the country it
&gt;should be okay if you're careful.  Also, it's not a good idea to tow at night.

I'll have you know we read very well down South, thank you very much.  We
just usually spell it  &quot;Kar in Toe&quot; to describe what happens when Bubba
drives his pickem-up truck over your foot.  8=&gt;
