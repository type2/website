     I don't have time to respond to every message but I have found
     that the real problem for most is a dirty windshield. 
     Mainly grease and oils that come off the road. It needs
     to be cleaned with &quot;bonaime&quot; (spelling). It's like Comet, or Ajax,
     but will not scratch the glass.
