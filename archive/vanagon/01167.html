Subject: exhaust success

Hi Frank and congrats....   looks like the best deal possible. VW prices 
have improved since I checked 3 years ago ($440 for a muffler) Send me RMR 
phone number please!. Won't CTC warranty the muffler for life if they 
install it?, might pay since I burnt one out in 2 years. I used stainless 
steel Allen head screws to replace all the exhaust studs, &lt;$5.00 and they 
are easier to get at in tight places. Whatever. Maybe I should fix mine 
properly?   tjs
