Subject: '66 bus engine progress report



Hi all,

I'm going to try to keep a log of my work building an engine for
&quot;Red&quot;, my 1966 standard microbus.  As it may be of interest to some
people on this list and because the collective wisdom  and experience
of this group is greater than my own I'll try to post it all here at
vanagon_at_lenti.  Um, I'll try to take some pictures and scan 'em in
for my web site too, we'll see how it goes.

It all started last week when I bought a used '69 bug engine at one
of the junk-yards here in Tucson for $150...

Saturday morning I walked out to my shed where I going to build this engine.
I opened the door and there was the dirty, grimey core engine sitting on the
floor *next* to my borrowed engine stand.  &quot;Yuck, I just hope the case and
heads are rebuild-able&quot;, I thought.  The engine wasn't on the stand because
I didn't have the proper bolts/spacers to mount it properly.  It's a nice
sturdy VW-specific stand, not like the universal stand I used when I rebuilt
the type IV engine in my '72.  This one fits better/easier.

So, off to the hardware store for some bolts and steel pipe (3/8&quot;) and washers.
While I was out I needed to get some solvent and look around at solvent tanks.
Last engine rebuild I used a large square plastic vat I bought at Home Depot
as a solvent tank.  This worked OK except to drain the solvent I had to pick
up the whole thing and pour the solvent into a funnel and thus back into a gas
can.  I was hoping to improve on this method.  Saw a couple solvent tanks,
saw the prices, decided to use the tub again.  I bought 5 gallons of solvent
for $27 at a Big-A parts store.  The solvent came in a nice steel 5-gallon can
with a pop-up pour-spout.  Seems like last time I bought solvent I went into
the industrial part of town and got it for less money but had to bring my
own gas can. Oh well.

This particular parts store (it's a LAPS, I can't judge the &quot;friendly&quot; part yet)
is also the home of my new machine shop, Prince-Oracle Machine.  Earlier in
the day, I had gone past the machine shop I used for my last engine rebuild and
it was gone, kaput, out-of-business, the building was empty.  Too bad, they did
good work.  So I stopped by a speed shop nearby to ask if they might be able
to balance my engine for me.  They said no but pointed me to Prince-Oracle.

So I talked to the machinist there, John Redgate.  John told me that he used
to do air-cooled Volkswagen work almost exclusively but that times have changed
and he's doing a lot of water-cooled now.  (There was a pile of VW engine
cases in the middle of the shop and a bunch of VW cylinder heads here and
there but there were even more big steel V-8 blocks and such on engine stands.)
John knows Tom Wilson of &quot;How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-cooled Engine&quot;
fame (HP books) and is acknowledged inside the front cover of that book.
This is interesting to me because I have often referred to Tom's book for
information.

Anyway, we chatted.  Now, I've been asking around about align-boring cases.
Bob Hoover and others have recommended getting the job done by a shop that
uses a large, dead-on-case-center-line, align-boring machine rather than
the small tool used by most shops that indexes off the case bore and is
powered by a drill.  Dave Black told me he thinks maybe the engine in his '71
died because of a low quality align-boring job.  So I asked John about his
align-boring tool.  He pointed to one of the above mentioned drill powered
align-boring tools hanging on a pegboard on the wall of his shop.  Hmm, I'll
be sending my case to RIMCO for align-boring.

Got home, got the engine mounted on the engine stand fork but had to wait
till someone else got home to put the fork-engine combination up into the
main part of the stand.  Janice, my SO, isn't really keen on lifting large
heavy greasy objects but she helped me lift the engine.

Now, to work.  Take off clutch pressure plate and friction plate, delay
taking off gland nut and flywheel until I can make up a flywheel lock
and buy a 3/4&quot; breaker bar, take off intake manifold, fuel pump, generator
stand, heater boxes, many bits of tin.  The rear crank-shaft pulley was
already loose so that was easy.  I soon had it down to the long block.

Time to clean that pile of parts before I go on.  I couldn't find my nice
brass parts cleaning brush so I tried using a plastic vegetable brush but 
it self-destructed in the solvent, little pieces of plastic and brush bristles
everywhere in the solvent, messy, messy, messy.  This left me with only an
old used tooth-brush so I trundled off to Sears and picked up an official
clean-your-parts-in-solvent brush with some sort of plastic bristles that
works quite well.  I also got a small steel brush, just a little bigger than
a tooth-brush and labeled as a brush for cleaning up welds.  Good, it can
do me double duty.

I noticed, while cleaning, that none of the tin pieces seem to have any
Volkswagen part numbers.  Most of the other parts do.  And no VW stamp
anywhere.  They look like stock, black, VW tin pieces, why no VW stamp?
The dog-house fan shroud I got is going to need a little welding before
I paint it.  One of the points of attachment for the coil is pulling
out of the shroud, from vibration I guess.  I'll use my wire-feed welder
on that.

I finally got back to the engine, removed the rocker covers, rocker arms,
and one head.  This first head looks good, no cracks, good looking valves,
etc.  When I get back to work I'll soon see how the other head looks.
Cylinders look like 85.5mm but I'll have to measure more carefully, I'll
be ordering new &quot;jugs&quot; soon.

Oh, one more question for those who know.  Bernie Bergman sells a
counterweighted 69mm crank for less than $100.  Anybody have any experience
with these cranks?  Are they so poorly made/crooked that I would be better
off with a stock crank?  Also, Chirco, here in town, has a counterweighted
69mm crank for $119.  Anybody tried one of those?

to be continued...
