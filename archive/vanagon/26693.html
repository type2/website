&gt;Was in a discussion with two friends yesterday. One has a 4x4 and the 
&gt;other has a Vanagon Syncro. They were debating whether the Syncro 
&gt;would be a good car in snow ( the snycro has yet to be tested in snow 
&gt;by my friend).
&gt;snip&gt;
&gt;The 4x4 argument was that the Syncro wheel base is too long 
&gt;for the syncro to be effective in fighting slipping and sliding in 
&gt;the snow, becuase of over compensation at the front end. 
&gt;snip&gt;
&gt;So my question to all you knowledgable Syncrometers - How does the 
&gt;Syncro handle in Snow/Ice Winter conditions?
&gt;Thanks!

Hey Matt, that's Syncronauts to you!  :-)

In my limited experience, (Wintertime in the mountains, skiing, etc.) the
Syncro has been excellent in the snow but I haven't encountered much ice. The
line about the long wheelbase doesn't seem to make any sense to me, even if
the Syncro had a long wheelbase.  The Syncro has a relatively short
wheelbase, I remember it beeing just about 6&quot; longer than a CJ7.  An
important key to traction in the Syncro or the friend's 4x4 is a Locking
Differential.  This was an option on the Syncro rear differential and
available aftermarket for the 4x4.  I can make all the difference in the
world!

Somehow, I don't think that any volume of Internet comments will settle this
argument.  Your friends are just going to do some head-to-head testing to see
for themselves!
