OK, the lesson here (couldn't get the Campmobile to run after
setting valves/replacing plugs/fooling with distributor) is
to NOT move the engine between the time you remove the
distributor and the time you drop it back in again!

Runs great, but I've developed one hell of an oil leak. Unsure
if I blew some kind of seal or what, but we're talking
PUDDLES of oil. Bad news here! Gotta look into fixing that...
