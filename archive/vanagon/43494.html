Subject: New subscriber needs advice on purchase

Greetings All,
As a new subsriber to this list, I have to say that the amount
of information presented here is incredible. I especially enjoyed the list
of terms that was posted over the weekend to bring new readers up to speed.

I checked out a possible purchase over the weekend and I was wondering
if anyone could give me some advice.

72 Westfalia Camper (has luggage rack, cabinets, couch that folds out
into bed). Engine seems to be pretty good (I only got a quick look and
drive before it got dark). Body has a few spots and has been recently
repainted badly (would definitely need work down the road).

The inside is really rough. The DPO repainted the headliner to cover up
mold (this is the deep humid south). Fortunately, the paint is coming
off on its own. The cabinets aren't in the best shape and are missing
handles and so forth. The couch is complete but has some mold and there
is yellow shag carpeting front to back.

I am thinking about going and taking another drive and getting a better look
at the engine since the owner told me on the phone that she doesn't think it
is the original.

The price is $950 (not real firm, the owner is more worried about a good
home than getting money out of it).

The questions I have are

1. Has anybody dealt with the problem of mold and mildew on headliners and
other parts? Are there other areas I should check out?

2. Any mechanical problems specific to the 72 that I should look for/ask about?

3. How hard is it to remove/work on/replace the bed and cabinets?

4. What do you think of the price?

thanks in advance for any suggestions and keep up all the good advice

brian
