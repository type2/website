&gt;&gt;P.S.

&gt;&gt;The canvas is the child cot that goes over the front seat.  Just not a very
&gt;&gt;big child.

Hey waddya mean? My parents used to stuff me in there!  Does your cot have 
the leather restraining straps and muzzle?  Seriously, those cots will hold 
lots, if the fabric is still good, I slept in one til age ten, one window 
rolled down halfway to let me stretch my legs from time to time. Our kid 
loves his now, but he's waiting for the upper bed to be working properly 
next summer.  Tim Smith
