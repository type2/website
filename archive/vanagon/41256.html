Subject: Carlisle PA show and swap ?

Can anyone comment on the Carlisle Imports show and swapmeet coming up next
weekend?  Size of swap meet, type of cars to be seen, relative incidence
(both in show and swap) of chrome plated plastic versus cheap greasy steel.
Anything to help me determine whether a 2-3 hour drive each way would be
worthwhile.  Thanks!
B.
