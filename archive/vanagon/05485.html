&gt; Hey kids!
&gt; 
&gt; Good news on the muffler front.  I am rebuilding my exhaust/heater assembly
&gt; (thank God the exchangers are still solid :) ) and I am buying most of the
&gt; parts from our dear freinds at Rocky Mountain Motorworks.  They have a free
&gt; flow muffler for my particular breed o' bus ('78 siebsitzer) for, get this,
&gt; 

Phone number?
