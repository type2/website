&gt;Now the '54 is _officially_ mine, but I have to drag it down there
&gt;for VIN verification still.


Hi Thom,

I had do do this twice when I lived in California--once for a '54 BSA
motorcycle and once for a bug.  What I did was call the city police and
explain the situatiion (doesn't run, no tow bar, etc) to them and asked if
they would have an officer stop by for the vin verification.  Both times
they were very pleasant about it and came right away.   This was in San
Luis Obispo, where the police had little to do--Sacramento may be different
but it is worth a shot.
