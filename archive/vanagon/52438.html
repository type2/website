&gt;  Does anyone remember the story of the Exploding Battery iin the
Eurovan!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  I do, that's the first thing I thought of when I read this POST!  I don't
want to alarm you Cyndi, but there have been a few instaces where the
batteries in the eurovan's have failed, either boiling themselves dry, or in
one case I read on this list.  It exploded!

  If this were my van, I'd check the water level in the battery to make sure
the Sulfur smell was or was not coming from that source.

  I read this post and Trashed it, after a second I remembered the Exploding
battery and had to write something about it.
