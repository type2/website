Subject: the silver socket


This subject never totally dies, does it?  :)  For newbies interested
in purchasing appliances/accesories which power off the silver socket
(also called Euro-socket), many can be had thru the Thing Shop aka
the Trim Shop in Arizona.  Some are OEM, some new inventions.  It's
also possible to get adapters (if not thru them, then other places)
which allow Euro-socket appliances to work of the standard cig. liter
socket, and vice-versa.  In Germany (and perhaps here), it's even
possible to rewire all your gizmos with a plug which can adapt to
either/both.

Here's the info for the store in Arizona, which specializes in
items for the VW type 181 thing:
