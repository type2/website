Subject: ANNOUNCE: Alternative Type2 List Addresses

You should now be able to use the following addresses for the type2 list:

To post mail, you can use the address

   type2_at_type2_dot_com

To send commands to the server, you can use the address

   listserv_at_type2_dot_com

We haven't changed servers again, these are just aliases that are easier to
remember than the real addresses. This has not been extensively tested but
it works when I try it. ;)
