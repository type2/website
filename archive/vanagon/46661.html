Subject: V_at_L stickers?

Hey, the last couple of days it seems that a number of people are offering
V_at_L stickers for the stickerless.  I'm on digest (and I work 12 to 14 hours
a day) so...I never manage to be able to raise my hand and say &quot;I'll take
one!&quot; If anyone has a spare or two,  Please let me know.  I remember that
they weren't free so I'll gladly reinburse you for the cost of the sticker
as well as the postage.
