&gt;Crank end-float - excessive end-float in the crank makes these seals
&gt;wear quickly. It can be assessed (with the engine in the van) by
&gt;grabbing the crank pulley (engine stopped !!!) and alternately trying
&gt;to pull it bodily out of the back of the van, and push it through the
&gt;engine. If it moves (backwards &amp; forwards, not round &amp; round) enough
&gt;for you to *see* it (rather than just feel/hear a clunk, then there
&gt;may be excessive end-float.

Actually the spec for this fore-and-aft play, is .002&quot; - .004&quot;. Yes,
that's thousandths, or about the thickness of a human hair. IMHO if you
can even feel this play, then you've probably got too much. Shops have
gauges to measure this exactly, but you have to take the engine out
just to measure.

It is adjusted by changing the three shims that go between the flywheel
and the crankshaft end-- they come in different thicknesses. But if your
end play is excessive, no amount of shimming will help. In this case, you
may have an excessively worn thrust-bearing journal in your crankcase,
which can only be &quot;fixed&quot; by replacing the case (or, has anyone heard
of a welding fix for this problem?).

The seal has been a weak point in upright engines for a long time.
They're cheap, but you have to take the engine out to replace them  :-(

Good luck!
