Alice and I have a friend in the navy, and from the growing list of demands, I 
think what you're really interested in is a nuclear powered camper.  He has 
officer's quarters on a sub, and says that our vanagon is roomy in comparison.  
So... all we need is a little shielding, a small nuclear reactor (going cheap in
the former Soviet Union to terrorists, 3rd world countries, and VW fanatics), 
and I think we're there.  No more power problem climbing the hills in this baby!
