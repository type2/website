Subject: VW sighting report

Hello,
        I went wandering around Traverse City early this afternoon, walked
for about an hour. They have the downtown blocked off for a big sidewalk
sale. I noticed 3 other vw's.
        1 Syncro westie, silver, looked nice inside
        1 EV
        1 Water cooled Vanagon.
and a yellow bug.
 
        Not bad for an hour in town here. I did see a westie (72-79 body
style) in front of me yesterday, painted green from the fiberglass top down,
Oklahoma plates and a bike rack on top. Today was good for walking around
the downtown.
        Enjoy the summer.
