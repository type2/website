Subject: Oil light won't go out : 1982 diesel
Date: Sun, 25 Sep 1994 16:03:14 -0600

Hi,
In the continuing saga with oil spray, I did this:
I got a can of Kmart special engine (external) spray cleaner.  I sprayed it
all over my engine and then sprayed it at the car wash.  This sure took
a lot of gunk out but the only thing is this --- my oil light will not go out.
It did go out before the spray, I even put in an extra quart of oil.  But now,
it simply will not go out.  Does anyone out there have an idea of how to
correct this?  Probably somewhere there is an oil sensor which is shorting
out ..... or a fuse may be blown.  But, the fuses that I can see in the fuse
block look fine.  Thanks for any help!
