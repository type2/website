&gt; Awww right!  A flame war on levers...

 :-)

 I'm taking a stab in the dark, here, as it's a while since I've driven a
brick: I seem to remember that one of the &quot;simple&quot; things about the heater
system is that to get full defrost you just pushed all the levers to one side,
setting cold air off and all the heat to the screen. That seems better to me
than the &quot;logical&quot; arrangement where the footwell &amp; screen levers turn on in
the same direction.

 If my memory is flawed the just ignore me &amp; I'll go away again :-)

Cheers,
        W.
