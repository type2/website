Sean,
What a bummer!  I just paid $200 to have my rear bumper straightened
and re-chromed (the re-chrome is necessary because the straightening
process damages the finish).  There are after-market bumpers available
for about $150 (Bus Depot), but my previous experience with
after-market bumpers has been disappointing (although they weren't
from Bus Depot), as they were thinner and weaker than original with
chrome that didn't last. So I went with the repair to the original.
I understand VW charges $400-450 for a new one.  Be sure to check
behind the bumper for any hidden damage to bodywork or brackets before
you agree on a price.  There can be some expensive damage in this
area.  The end caps are $10-25 depending where you buy them.  I think
Bus Depot's are $9.95, dealer's are about $25.  You will also need new
clips for the rubber strip along the face of the bumper if you have
that style.
