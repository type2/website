Subject: Re: Stuck Parking Brake

Hadn't been paying attention at first.  Probably should have.  I thought 
I had a &quot;real&quot; problem with one rear brake on my Eurovan.  Now I know 
what it is.  Hadnt put together the rain bit.  I knew there was a reason 
I read this list...

&gt; &gt;First, I'll start by telling you about your weather.  It was raining when you
&gt; &gt;parked the van and you drove through several puddles on that last drive.  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;When this happens, rust can quickly build up on the inside of the drum and
&gt; &gt;bond the shoe to the drum.  I'm not certain if this affects other vehicles,
&gt; &gt;but it's happend to my 87 Syncro a couple of times.  This can happen
&gt; &gt;overnight, and a mild case can happen (where you feel the resistance and
&gt; &gt;then, THUNK, it unsticks) just during a day at work.  It certainly hasn't
&gt; &gt;happened to any other vehicle I've driven.  In order to prevent it, I ride
&gt; &gt;the brake just a bit before I park, hoping to heat up the drum enough to
&gt; &gt;eliminate as much water as possible before parking.  I can't say for sure
&gt; &gt;that this works, but I haven't had this happen since I've started doing this.
