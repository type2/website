&gt; clutch  cable', when I finally got down into it to fix it, turned out 
&gt; to have been  a broken clevis pin ($2.25 separately) and grotesquely 
&gt; worn lever arm ($ 15.75)- can you say Total Lubrication Failure? 
&gt; The hole that the clevis pin goes through was elongated to a length
&gt; of over twice its original diameter- it was near to worn through
&gt; when the pin itself failed.

I feel for you. 2 weeks after I bought my bus, I had this problem. Was 
about 300-400 miles aways from home at the time as well. Fortunately, I 
had an uncle in San Diego where it happened, and well, the bus is happy, 
I'm happy. Good karma aboundeth. 
On a side note, this is something I check periodically now. Any 
suggestion from the list as to how often. Last time for me was in 
December. I'm gonna pop the bottom apron off this afternoon and take a 
peek at it today, while installing a twin airhorn set off of an 
electionic compressor. Can't wait to test it out on some bicyclists...
