Subject: Re: engine for 73 bus.
Date: Thu, 22 Jun 95 8:22:52 MDT

The 2.0L engine also came in 2 head flavours as well.  Up to about '78 or '79 
they used the type 4 exhaust ports with the copper washers and then went to 
vanagon heads with a flat gasket and more rectangular port appearance.  Oddly 
enough the '72-'74 heater boxes and the '79-'83? heater boxes (in Canada) 
look the same from the outside but have different exhaust port fittings.  I 
know this because I have a '73 van (1.7L) and picked up a 2.0L out of a wreck 
to rebuild.  The idea being that the leasurely rebuild of the out of bus engine 
could occur while I still had a running unit in the van.  I looked at the 
rebuild costs on the 2.0L and decided to take the bus out of service and 
rebuild the cheaper 1.7L instead.  Core costs on the 2.0L rods were US$100 
a piece with some stories about rebuilders not accepting your old units as 
core but then having them &quot;disappear&quot; in the mail when you told them to send 
them back to you or you getting a REALLY pooched used rod back that they just 
happened to substitute for the one that you sent.  My 2.0L also had a worn cam 
and lifters as well as very rusted vanagon heater boxes.  On occasion I've 
though of ripping out the rods and selling them to a rebuilder for the US$100 
fee.  I'd actually make a profit on the engine if one of them would go for it.

&gt; &gt; Dear bus fanatics,
&gt; &gt;   I have a 73 bus with the 1700cc engine. Runs fine, but I was wondering if
&gt; &gt; I can fit the big 2000cc fuel injected engine if I ever have to put in a new
&gt; &gt; one. Any opinions out there ???
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to do this soon.  The flywheel on the 2.0 is larger (228 vs
&gt; 210 mm, I think) so you will have to upgrade your clutch and pressure
&gt; plate.  Don't use the smaller one, the 2.0 will likely overpower it.
&gt; If you use the FI you will have to install the brain and lots of other
&gt; crap and possibly have smog check problems (oh wait, probably NOT in
&gt; Oregon!) or you can keep your original heads and intake and have your
&gt; heads flycut to fit the 94mm cylinders.  You will also need to adjust
&gt; your carbs, I think.  Probably larger jets.  I think it will be worth
&gt; it, in my case.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I saw what the core charge is for 2.0 rods - $100 *each*.  Don't
&gt; think you can build a 2.0 from a 1.7/1.8 if you don't have the 2.0
&gt; rods.  :/
