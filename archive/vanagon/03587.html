&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; You need to use wing vent pry-in preventers. These are little metal pieces
&gt;&gt; that make it so you can't just pry the wing vent lock up out of the way and
&gt;&gt; push in the window.
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;
...unless, of course, the perps *break* the window, which is what
happened to my brother...

(They stole his non-working radio, btw; bet they got a surprise.)
