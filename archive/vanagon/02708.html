&gt; Gee...an inspiration....John Sebastian's &quot;Make up your mind&quot;....
&gt; 
&gt; Did you ever have to make up your mind...
&gt; 
&gt; Say yes to one and leave the other behind....
&gt; 
&gt; Its not always fair, Its not always kind....
&gt; 
&gt; Did you ever have to make up your mind.....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Some times you have to put up with the songs on Fridays...
&gt; With all of the drivel and all of the caffeine......
&gt; Then one empty Friday comes right along...
&gt; No trip plans...not even a song....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ok...someone take it!
&gt; 

I wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot curser!   ;)
