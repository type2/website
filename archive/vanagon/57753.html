Subject: magnesium smoke inhalation?


I keep forgetting to ask this question.  It comes up at every single
one of our CCC's campouts.

Is breathing the smoke from a magnesium fire for certain harmful?  I
don't think anyone in our group can be accused of inhaling the stuff
on purpose or in large quantities, but I&quot;m sure some of it gets into
our lungs simply because we breathe it in the air so close to
the fire.  

Anyway, will be appreciative if someone can answer the question
as to just how harmful this stuff is...
