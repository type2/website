Subject: Re: 914 trans in a bus?



        &gt;I was wondering if it would be possible to swap a 914 5-speed
&gt;transmission into my 73 bus.  There is one for sale in the paper for
&gt;$100. It sure would be nice to have a 5th gear, and closer ratios (I'm
&gt;assuming with 5 gears the ratios would be closer).  Anyone have
&gt;experience with this?  I know the engine turns it in the wrong direction,
&gt;but I heard once that there was some shaft that could be reversed, or
&gt;something.  Help?

David:
The ring and pinion can be flopped to the other side, but I would not recommend
it. If you were to look at the way the ring &amp; pinion mate, and you were to move
the R&amp;P to the other side of the tranny, you have changed surfaces of the gears
that will carry the load. This will work, don't get me wrong, but it will
probably be a noisy beast.Just my $.02
