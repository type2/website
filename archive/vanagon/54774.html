Subject: re Shifting, no clutch

I've had to limp around too without a clutch when mine failed.  I even
managed to drive mine home on the LA freeways, in fourth gear!  Another
listmember suggested not *jamming* the shifter from one gear to
another.  I concur, let it *feel* its way slowly into the next gear as
you upshift.  Downshifts can also be done too, if one is careful, and
uses a technique similar to *double clutching*, namely hit the gas while
passing thru neutral on the way from the higher to the lower gear. 
Again, the key is to match speeds of the various revolving pieces to
allow them to mesh.

On the downside, I'm sure that shifts without the clutch can't be good
for the synchromesh pieces in the trans.  Since the clutch-less episode,
I've noticed that mine isn't nearly as easy to get into first or from
first to second as it once was.  But then, my trans has 235,000 miles on
it and some wear is probably inevitable!  Someone posted a suggestion
for a type of synthetic gear oil recently.  I'd love to see that
suggestion reposted, it sounds like it might help me extend the life of
my trans another couple of years.
