Subject: wasserboxer head gasket leak fixes?

Hi vanagoners,

No I haven't traded in my '62 for a vanagon, (nor have I transplanted its
engine :-) ) but a friend of a friend has an '86 westy with
the infamous &quot;head gasket leak&quot; diagnosed by the dealer
a while ago as &quot;not too bad&quot; but now after a long trip the guy noticed the
usual puddle was bigger :-(

Anyway, I was wondering if you wasserboxer dudes and dudettes had a FAQ or
some kind of advice on options for what he could do that I could print out
and give to him (he's not online).

Thanks in advance, and I'm sure the guy and his bus will thank you
profusely. . . . . . .
