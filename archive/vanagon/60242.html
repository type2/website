&lt;&lt; Can someone tell me what the definition of a &quot;Mini-Van&quot; is? &gt;&gt;

VW invented the &quot;mini-van&quot; concept, and vehicle back in 1950, but Chrysler
invented the &quot;Minivan&quot; NAME in '84 for their sh*tboxes.

BUT don't EVER call a VW Van a &quot;Minivan&quot;.....  :&lt;)

'nuff said....  :&lt;)
