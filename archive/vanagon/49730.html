Hello,

I recently purchased an '87 GL Wolfsburg; 88k miles. The Michelin MXL 
205/70 R-14's are ready to be replaced.  My questions are:

1.  Is it possible/beneficial to switch to 15&quot; wheels?

2.  Is there any advantage to going from stock steel to alloy wheels 
(besides the cool look, of course!)?

3.  What tires/sizes would be recommended for best all around (no snow) 
driving: freeway; backroads; dirtroads.

4.  Has anyone had experiences with LT or At type tires?

Thanks in advance.

Daniel
