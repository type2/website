The question was:

Tell us your opinion !

Volkswagen and Audi are specialists for four-wheel-driven vehicles. 
Nevertheless, since the 1980s - after Iltis and T3 syncro 16'' the model-range 
lacks a vehicle with real off-road capabilities.

Do you miss an Audi or VW off-road vehicle ?

FaxNo. +49 - 711 - 4 58 78 98

Important in any case: Please refer to the opinion-poll in &quot;Gute Fahrt&quot; (issue 
06/97; pg. 8)

Bye and thanks for your help !
