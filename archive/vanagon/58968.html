Subject: another &quot;owns one&quot;

grettings:
just bought an 89 westie w/ 47k miles and an interior that has not even
been broken-in. Will be picking it up from the dealer Monday. One though
it had been sitting somewhere as part of an estate dispute, so when the
dealer got it he had a new clutch put in. (I guess the sitting time took
its toll) I had the coolant flushed and replaced and checked for leaks.
The mech told the dealer who told me (heard from a friend who heard from
a friend) that the thermostat housing was replaced due to a small leak.
Anyway after much drooling and anticipation I finally got to drive it
for about 20 minutes I took it around the freeway and down some
sidestreets and after verifying that it was not my standard driving
skills found that when i shifted from 2nd to 3rd it would grind. What is
the normal procedure for a clutch replacement. They said the master and
slave cylinder had also been changed. Does this sound like maybe just a
linkage adjustment? I will check out the details on the mechs invoice to
double check what was done, but in the meantime apart from needing new
tires (which I was just educated on) I acn hardly wait to take this
puppy home..PS after driving around a little and looking hard I founf
the gas and temp gauge. The temp gauge was at about the half way mark
and it seemed to stay there. I will continue to closely monitor this.
pss the stats dont show a Texas Corpus Christi, wasup?
