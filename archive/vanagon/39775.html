NON VW STUFF RE: FRIDAY HUMOR

Apologies to the list (again). 

Perhaps my earlier response was unnecessitated.  At the very least, it was not 
well thought out.   In my defense, I do people's taxes for a living and  Friday 
was a very ugly day.  As far as the jokes go, my personal belief (although I 
apparently must get off myself so skip the rest of this paragraph if you wish) 
is that there are certain things you don't joke about because they make others 
uncomfortable.  I don't see any jokes about American slavery of blacks or the 
holocaust of jews in Germany.  I heard these jokes when I was 5.  Please, feel 
free to joke about whatever you want.  I won't respond any further.  Joking 
about such things makes them more acceptable, which in turns makes it more 
likely that your brother in law will 'feel up' your seven year old at the next 
family outing.  Ponder that the next time you're faded in the back of your bus, 
hooked up to your cellular and grooving to Janis J.  (So will I).  I have 
nothing against aging hippies, it's the pervert part that I hate.  If you'd 
like to label this as 'political correctness' in order to dismiss it, go 
ahead.  So let's talk VW:

VW STUFF

I went to an interesting junkyard this weekend (thanks to Lynne and Rachel) in 
Acushnet, MA.  This guy has tons of ancient buses and bugs, and currently 
drives a 70's-something Dormobile.  (I think you know him Ric).  Anyway, the 
guy was really interesting and has a ton of VW history in his head.  
Unfortunately, he doen't like to piece things out, so I couldn't find any parts 
I need.  In any case, it's worth the trip just to check out what's sitting in 
his yard.  It was a little sad to see all of the old VW's just rotting away.  I 
got the sense that at one time or another, he had plans to do something with 
all of them, but just ended of with 100's of hunks of metal.  He told us he 
thought the town would eventually force him to get rid of them all.  He keeps 
the windows and doors closed to preserve the interiors, some of which were in 
pretty decent shape.  If anyone wants directions, just mail me back.  He's 
willing to sell, you just have to take the whole thing (and he'll help you with 
the tow).

Also, he told me about a guy in Texas who makes canvas replacements for old 
westfalias.  Does anyone know his name?  Mine is completely gone. 

Thanks

Mike
