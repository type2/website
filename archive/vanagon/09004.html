Subject: Semi Digest Notes

So if some of this is behind.  I have been trying to catch up on my mail since
last week.

Fram filters:

We have been using them since day one.  We use them in our &quot;fleet&quot; and change
the oil and filters every 3K miles.  This includes several VWs, Volvos and
an Aerostar.  The Vanagon has been using Frams since new.  My rabbit truck
which is the oldest ('82 with 170K miles) still gets 25psi at idle when warmed
up and 90 psi on the road.  I also autocross it and waiting in the staging line
at 90+ temps it still does fine.

My brother's volvo one time had a WIX filter in it and he had noted that it
took longer for the oil light to go out ever since he had put it on.  The fram
filters seem to start up faster as compared to others we had used.

One thing, when we used to have a 72 bus the fram filter we used was the same
size that is called for in the volvos but have different part numbers.
Looking inside one had a valve and the other didn't.  I can't recall which
was which but we could use either one without any problems.

Speeding Buses:

I got stopped twice for speeding in the bus.  Both times I got warnings 
because because they looked faster they really are to the police.  My mother
once got pulled over in the vanagon doing 60 in a 45 (which was right).
She was let go because the officer said that it just looks fast.

Moving Bathrooms:

I drive 120 miles round trip for work at a university.  So I see lots of people
that pass me doing all kinds of things.  Hair and makeup are the usual things
with both hands off the steering wheel.  One thing I don't understand how
people can read notes, textbooks, or newspapers doing 75mph and concentrate.
I once saw a guy had a portable tv on his dash watching the morning news.

Hormones:

Have you ever watch Beavis and Butt-head on MTV?  One show had Bill Clinton
proclaim them Students of the Year because they were 'hormonally challenged'
while trying to adjust to the school environment.  Great show.

Desk items:

I keep a hatchet in my desk drawer.  I will use one day when I go on my killing
rampage after I have to answer years of stupid questions.

  Reporter: Can you tell us what happened?
  Survivor: Well, he was always by himself in his office.  Then he comes
            out with a hatchet mumbling &quot;people, no brains, passwords&quot; and
            that's then the killings started.

Enough for now.  Happy New Year!
