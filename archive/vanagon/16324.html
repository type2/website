Subject: Re: waving = spreading peace

    Before I got my Camper, I always noticed all the VW's on the road and, in
passing, we'd exchange that subtle, knowing nod-thing, and sometimes I'd wave
too, even though I was sputtering around in my '71 Dodge Demon at the time,
and often I'd get a &quot;...wha'??&quot; look from some of the recipients, but it
always felt right.
     Driving around town in Ramona has certainly added a certain
&quot;officiality&quot; to my waving, and has on several occassions prompted other bus
and vanagon owners to catch up to us (which is certainly do-able : )) for a
&quot;hey!&quot;, or a peace sign, or a &quot;what year is it?&quot;, but ALWAYS it is a gesture
of peace and friendliness.
     It would be cool if we all just waved to eachother when we were out and
about, but for now it seems to be our own secret handshake on the mean
streets of this high ole life, and I take to it just fine; me an' Ramona,
drivin' around grinnin' , with this nasty old world laid out before us, and,
in our wake, like a leaky transmission, is a trickling trail of old-fashioned
peace.
     So if you ask me, waving is great for the soul. I wouldn't doubt that it
might also be good for your Bus. Like bread 'n butter. 
     Right as rain.              -Rach &amp; Ramona
