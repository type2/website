Subject:       Re: VW motor lifespan ? (A Poll!)

Skerbitz and Smith Pollsters Inc. ask:
&gt; &gt;Are there any good statistics on the life of a VW Water-cooled HO 4-bnager?

I'd wanted to respond to this so I'll send to both Smith and 
vanagon.lenti.

I can give data on 4 vans, but not down to VIN #'s for the last 2.

1.  '85 Weekender with 1.9L and auto, 116K miles, heads drip (but no
combustion chamber leaks), many 'little' things but inside never
opened, basic guts good and no/little oil consumption.

2.  '87 Westy with 2.1L and 4spd, 162K miles, heads drips (no 
combustion leaks), NO oil consumption, great compression and runs 
just fine, engine never opened, nice shape.

the above 2 are mine, from here on the details are second-hand...

3.  '87,'88 or '89 (not sure which), over 300K miles (yes, that's 
right), no major work, engine in nice shape and traded for a Eurovan.

4.  '84 1.9L with 4spd, 150K miles, lotsa little stuff but basic 
engine good and never been opened, heads drip.

I think the water pump has been replaced on all 4, cv joints, exhaust 
systems, yada yada yada.
