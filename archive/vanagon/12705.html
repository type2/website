&gt;&gt;&gt;If the engine has minor problems then I would rebuild it myself. Buy all needed
&gt;&gt;&gt;parts from VW dealer. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That strikes me as an unusual statement on this list. Wasn't the
&gt;&gt;conventional wisdom that VW is always more expensive than aftermarket
&gt;&gt;suppliers? I'm not at all suggesting that you're wrong; just curious to
&gt;&gt;hear on what you base your opinion?

I once rebulit my Volvo 264 engine. I basically replaced rockers and camshafts.
I decided not to go for dealer parts. I bought aftermakrket kits, made in
Germany, and saved at least 1/3 of cost. The cam and rocker lasted only
20k miles. I asked around what did I do wrong. I was told that I should
have bought OEM rockers. I believe OEM head gaskets are obviously higher
quality than aftermarket ones. I guess I would rather use the expensive
OEM parts on engine than have to tear it apart again later.

This is based on one experience on Volvo. I just thought it might be applicable
to VWs.
