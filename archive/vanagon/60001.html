Yes, the Honda and the Vanagon Syncro use a similar AWD system -- I think
some bits are even made by the same outfit.  They also both have disc brakes
and an internal combustion engine.  And both have four rubber tires.

I have a Syncro.  I think it is cool -- I'm always lusting after another.
But I'm not particularly &quot;finacially challenged&quot;.  Having a VW where parts
are difficult to find and really expensive is not for the faint of heart.  
The situation will only be getting worse, as even VW will stop supplying parts
for these eventually.  Ron said he had the front exhaust pipe from Dansk for
a &quot;reasonable&quot; price of only $200!  Reasonable only when compared with VW's
extortion.  It is really possible to sink tens of thousands into repairs
on a Syncro.  They are full of moving (and therefore wearing) parts that are
unique to the model.  The fact that they have a fluid-coupling like the
Hoda does is a silly comparison.  The VW coupling has apparently been pretty
reliable, but the CV joints and transmission, and engine have not garnered
that reputation.  I have other cars for transportation, too, and I would
never want to depend on basic transportation from something odd and difficult.
I have owned many odd vehicles -- I loved them, but did not usually depend
on them.  Losing a Syncro-specific bit in eastern Oregon (like I lost a
Puegeot bit there once) will ruin your whole day.  Probably your whole week.

They are cool, but don't equate cheapness of other busses with Vanagons -- and
don't equate the success of Honda with expectations of Volkswagen.  I have
both -- they are not comparable at all.

There have been some sub-$3000 Syncros out there recently (I paid $2400 for
mine a year ago), so they are not all that expensive to get into (but then
I got my 1980 Westfalia for $800).  I need a new exhaust, but am unsure if
I want to sink almost as much as I paid for the whole bus into an exhaust
that will only rust out again immediately.  Fortunately, this is my only
problem -- I have had really good experiences.  Others have horror stories.

Most of the Syncro owners on this list will not part with them -- but
they are great cash sinks.

&gt; I don't have a Syncro, but I do have a Honda Civic wagon with a similar 4
&gt; wheel system and I REALLY like it.  When the rain is coming down I can
&gt; actually feel it kick in.  I think it's paid for itself in terms of added
&gt; traction--and that's in Texas!  If I lived anywhere where there was much
&gt; ice and snow, I KNOW I'd always want to have it.  I don't know about VW,
&gt; but the Honda version has never required any work or repair and I'm about
&gt; to hit 160,000 miles.
