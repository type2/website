Subject:      ECU Question

Hi all,

I decided to check the ECU on my '86 Westy to see if it had been
replaced by the PO. While I could not tell I was hoping someone on the
list might know of some telltale signs that it had been.

I find the following numbers on the ECU case:
Bosch
0 261 200 284/285     810

22.02.94
26SA0000
1835 0105

The 22.02.94 looks like a date, but if I know European date schemes it
doesn't match the standard convention.

Any ideas or telltale signs?

By the way I just had the front end rebuilt and does it help! It
actually responds to steering correction. What a delight in side winds!
For those that are curious it cost me $650 labor and over $450 in parts
- ball joints, wheel bearings &amp; seals, bushings (upper &amp; lower support
arms, radius arms and stabilizer bar) and tie rod ends + alignment.

Thanks in advance,
Denys Mueller
'86 Westy
PO '80 &amp; '89 Westys'
