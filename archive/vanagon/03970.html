Subject: Re: and while we're at it ... (he's after the Unknowns again!)

&gt;My Van:   1968 converted kombi bus
&gt;		Right Hand Drive camperized in Devon England
&gt;		Chassis # 238117133 block # HO645601
&gt;		Bought in early 80's in Calgary by my Father
&gt;		Original owner brought is over to Canada.

&gt;My Problem:
&gt;		The clutch and accelerator cables are longer than
&gt;the ones for left hand drive!  I had problem this year when my
&gt;cable broke twice!  Once here and once on a toll bridge in the SF
&gt;Bay area late on a Sunday Night!  They had to lash two Cables
&gt;together! I am looking for someone who can give me information on
&gt;the exact length of the correct cable and anywhere I could get a
&gt;cable before it breaks again!  I don't expect any in N.A., but
&gt;know that UK and Australia, New Zealand and maybe other places
&gt;would have RHD vehicles.

&gt;PS do you share the information you have gathered?  Are there any
&gt;other RHD owners in N.America?

Hi, Darren,

I'll ask Anthony about other RHD owners here in the states. I think
I have heard him speak about this, so I think so.

We don't share the info, at large. Some people don't want info like
this distributed. If we travel in your area, we may call you and
ask if we can stop by. Sometimes, Anthony knows someone who wants
to sell a particular year bus and someone who wants to buy the
same, and he tries to connect them.

I'll try to get an answer about the cables, too. Will try to e-mail
you tomorrow, or watch the vanagon mail for it. 

Lori and Anthony Gelato
