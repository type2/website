Subject: Re: free west coast metric catalog

     &gt;new issue of Hot VWs in the mail ... big full page ad for West Coast 
     &gt;Metric, says &quot;call (310) 325-0005 and mention ad V12 and it's FREE!&quot;. 
     &gt;it's for Catalog No. 12, 1995 Collector Edition, in the May 95 issue.
     
     does it say anything about being free to overseas or not ??
     
     Lee.
