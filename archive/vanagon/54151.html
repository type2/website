Subject: fuel-injection runs really rich in my 81 2.0 vanagon

 Will someone please help me. I am trying champion 302's (hotter plug) and
it is o.k...
  Is there a way to adjust richness like cis-e injection in 80 Scirocco??
I've fiddled with the screw near the air-box and noticed no real
change...HELP
