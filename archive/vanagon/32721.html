Subject: The vanagon manual

The vanagon manul I advertised has been sold.
Wow these things go fast.
I will be keeping messages from all interested parties and ifthe first 
responder (Steve Maher) and I don't settle the deal. 'll contact the next 
responder in order. 

So Steve are you going to combine the vanagon manual and a chevy 
citation manual to make a v6anagon manual?

Now if I can only find a wireing diagram for my EV.

Thanx all for the interest!

Jack
