Interesting, Dan... Since the day I bought my '91, I've had this exact
problem regardless of Fram or Autobahn filters. At about 60,000 miles,
I still have it. I've been assured by service people that the oil pressure
is fine. After three warranty visits, where the dealer replaced the dynamic
oil pressure system control board and substituted an Autobahn filter for
my Fram, I gave up on the imcompetent dealer and have learned to live with
it. I use a different dealer for service now, so when I take the camper in
for 60,000 mile service, I think I'll ask them to give it a shot.

Dan, although the Autobahn filter fixed your buzzer annoyance for now,
I'll be curious to see how things pan out over time.  I haven't talked to
many other wasserboxer owners face to face, but three or four of the ones
I have spoken to also have seen the damn buzzer problem. One dealer had the
unmitigated gall to tell an owner that the buzzer/light is to tell you to
upshift!

I like your theory, though. I'll have to have a talk with the service
people about it when I take my camper in...
