Subject: RE: AC prices up.

CR&gt;5. Price of antifreeze is about to skyrocket due to an Eskimo cartel
CR&gt;   threatening to reduce production of a large portion of the 
CR&gt;   world's antifreeze wells;-) 

Particularly the incredibly rare phosphate free wells of the Western
Sahara, run by a splinter group of lost Eskimos of Germanic descent.
