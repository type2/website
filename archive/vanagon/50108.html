Subject: Repairing Heat Exchanger '81 Van?


 I have a problem with the left-side heat exchanger on my '81 Vanagon
 (California model); a portion of the &quot;bevel&quot; or &quot;bell&quot; on the end of
 the pipe that attaches to the muffler is worn away.  I'm told this is
 a common problem because of the design.  The heat exchanger seems OK
 otherwise.

 Anyway, is there any straight-forward of repairing this?  Can I
 simply cut off the &quot;bevel&quot; or &quot;bell&quot; (3/8ths of an inch or so) and come
 up with some other way of attaching the muffler to the pipe?  Or, if I
 cut this bit off, could a muffler shop put a new &quot;bell&quot; (what is the
 term for this?) on the remaining pipe?

 Thanks all.
