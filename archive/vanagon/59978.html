&gt; There have been a couple questions about optimal cruising speeds.  One
&gt; today said 65 mph for an 81 air cooled van.  Another Westy owner once
&gt; suggested 55 as optimal (for water cooled late 80's models).  I happened to
&gt; meet this guy while I was on a trip.  He claimed to have been a VW
&gt; mechanic.  My gas mileage soared!  But otherwise, at what point are you
&gt; being too hard on the van?  Under some circumstances 55 would be TOO slow
&gt; (in terms of traffic and conditions).
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts out there?  I, too, tend to try to drive my van gently.

We routinely push our 87GL Autoboxer down the intense Houston area
freeways at with a full load of pax, w/AC blazing Max Cold at 70MPH. As
well, we will drive 70 on trips.
