i said:
&gt; &gt;Many groups of things with breakdown potential (Norton owners for
&gt; &gt;example) publish a 'guide' of members who are willing to have their
&gt; &gt;name, address, and phone number listed.  This can serve a couple
&gt; &gt;functions:

then Sami said:
&gt; Good idea, but it's already being implemented. Neato and Limbo have their
&gt; list and Funkengroovin is also trying to put one up, I believe. Unless
you &gt; prefer a internet-geek list only...

so i say:
hmmm, i didn't realize that.  jeez, am i going to have to join them,
too?  :)

maybe a internet-geek list only would be good.  while it may be a
false impression, we know a little about some of us and i would
rather call on a list member since that is whom i'm familiar with.
