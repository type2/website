&gt; &gt; Well I have Done it,I bought a 1997 EV        winnie Two weeks ago
&gt; 
&gt;         Congratulations!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; lot of
&gt; &gt; differences between the two some bad some good In all honesty I would
&gt; &gt; say the westie version camper is better thought out almost like one
&gt; &gt; designer went camping and the the other didnt...
&gt; 
&gt;         Could you give some examples?  I have to believe that the Winnebago
&gt; designers have done some camping.  Is it a difference between European and
&gt; American camping?  I keep hearing on this list that Westfalia conversions
&gt; are better than the Winnebago, but I haven't seen any specific examples.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx.

&gt; 95 EV-C (Beulah)Drew,
	Dont misunderstand I love the EV (maybe cos its New and 
Reliable) But a couple of irritations are:
1, When the bed is out you cant get at the large cabinet So I cant cook 
breakfast while my Wife is Still in Wake up mode (this cabinet is the 
most suitable for a pantry...
2, the small cabinet with a mirror (obviously for toilet,shaving stuff)
	the mirror cant be viewed without doing contortions
3, the hanging clothes closet is harder to use mainly because of the    
 hanging seatbelt 
4, the underseat storage is a tight sqeeze to get stuff in.

However I have some simple ideas to over come most of these...Like 
splitting the large cabinet door so that The top third drops down on 
piano hinge so that i can at least acces the top shelf
also I am going to mount the mirror on a hinge so that it can be swung 
out when the door is open...etc etc

Anyway I am going to keep it for a long time I look forward to more info 
on a EV list
Dave WR3I 97 ev ....86 westie(untill its sold)
