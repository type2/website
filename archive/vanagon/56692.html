Subject: Smelly Heat


The air comming out of the heater in my 80 camper smells kind of like 
exaust.  It only smells when I have the heat on.  I was wondering if 
there is an air filter anywhere that could be replaced.  

Also, anyone know if I could install a fan for the heat?  What makes 
would work?
