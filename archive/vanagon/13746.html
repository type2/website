&gt; &gt; Somehow the previous owner of my '87 weekender lost a headrest.
&gt; &gt; My back bench/bed has room for three, but only has two....Big deal you
&gt; &gt; say???.... Me too!!!  I don't know why it bugs me cause i never sit in the
&gt; &gt; back, but almost every time i look in the rear view mirror, i mentally count
&gt; &gt; to two!!!

&gt; I've got the cheapskate answer for you Joe.  Put the headrests on far left and 
&gt; right seats (leaving the middle seat headrestless) and call it a &quot;feature&quot; to 
&gt; improve rear-view visibility.

You seem to have been joking but I usually take the middle headrest out 
from my EV to get the visibility.  I had thought about replying to that 
effect....
