&gt; Seriously nice to see a prog on TV that captured a feel in just a short five
&gt; mins -- the retired couple's home movie doing that river crossing in Africa in
&gt;  a Bay was truly amazing. Good one.                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 For those that didn't see it, it looked like they just put a couple of  
 planks across two dugout canoes, rolled their bus onto the planks and 
 paddled the whole lot across a *large* river to the otherside. Amazing...

 BTW, at the end of the camper van slot the program makers put up
 some &quot;vw camper facts&quot;, amongst which was the &quot;world record for
 speed in a camper is 170 mph!!!!&quot;.
