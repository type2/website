&gt;  After siphoning the tank the fuel line was removed from the bottem of the
&gt;  tank untill no fuel came out.  After the tank was enpty (I banged on it, it
&gt;  was empty) my guage still said it had about 1/4 tank left and when it was
&gt;  refilled it took just under 12 gal to fill my 16 gal tank.  Where were the
&gt;  other 4 gal hiding? &gt;&gt;
&gt;   Is it possible that the tank was once upon a time damaged fron a floor
&gt; hoist or jack pushing in the bottom?  Some brain service people think the
&gt; tank straps are actually frame rails and they use those to lift the van.
&gt;  Belive it or not, my experience shows that 4 gallons is the amont of damage
&gt; and the gauge does not read empty due to the tank bottom now holding it in
&gt; the air.  Just a thought,

Another possibility (long shot): on my Dad's '81 Rabbit Diesel, soon 
after we were towed in for waxed up fuel after skiing at -26 C 
(brrr!), the car ran out of fuel. Then it took only 6-8 gallons to 
fill up. This happened twice before he took it in to be looked at. 
Turns out the mechanic who had checked things after the tow 
had removed the air intake hose for the fuel system from its place 
near the injector pump. The hose then flopped around near the 
alternator belt, and eventually rubbed enough to melt the end of 
the vinyl hose shut. The suction of the pump on a closed fuel system 
had actually collapsed the fuel tank!! The VW dealer who discovered 
this could not believe it either, until he checked the hose and 
figured out what had happened.

Likely not your problem, but anything *is* possible...
