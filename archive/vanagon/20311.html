Subject: re:BakePacker recall

In trying to find out further info on this, it appears that my local REI 
(Dallas) store gave me wrong information.  In calling the manufacturer, they 
said that there is no recall, but that they are 1.5 months backlogged in 
production.  If anyone wants, they can take individual orders and ship 
immediately (509-484-3701), and they are scheduled to ship to the REI at the 
end of July.

Sorry if I upset you or anyone on the list.  It appears that REI didn't have 
the right information.  I just wanted to let folks know in case there was a 
problem.
