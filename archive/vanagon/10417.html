Does anyone out there really like to restore these? I would do it myself, but
it seems like a pain, and if there is someone who does a good job for a
realistic price, I would gladly send them off and have them done
&quot;professionally&quot;. My only reason for hesitation is that I have seen the job
some of my friends have done with the kits available, and I have not really
been impressed with the quality. Thank you in advance for your assistance.
