&gt;heating an RV while it is parked (and not plugged in).  Does anyone know
&gt;where you can get a good *vented* propane heater (catlytic?) for under a
&gt;hundred bucks?  That's what I want.

maybe we're going at this wrong ... let's look at it from a slightly
different perspective:

what other people/machines/lifestyles/recreation require similar heat? and
what do they do about it?

example:
- private aviation:
    what the heck do small two and four-place aircraft do for heat? cause
    it is gonna get really cold at 10,000 feet! and their engines aren't
    really any bigger than ours. (admittedly, their interior volume ... to
    be heated ... is much smaller).
- ice fishing:
    how do you heat those little shacks out on the ice?
- winter camping:
    any extra heat for the tents?
- boating:
    i think this is where the catalytic propane heaters came from, right?
- trucking:
    from what i know, they get extra heat from additional gas/diesel heaters.
    which, while very very nice, are very expensive (like $1500). full of
    nice features, but nobody wants to pay more for the heater than they
    paid for the bus.
- RV's:
    scaled-down household propane furnaces. way too big and expensive for
    vw buses.  but what about the smaller RV's? the little camper trailers
    and the class C (like the vw/winnebago camper for 95)? what do they use?
- submarines:
    ... nah. never mind. :)
- ??

anybody got any other ideas? small, not-necessarily-mobile, places of
habitation that need heating for their human (or animal!?) occupants??

surely somewhere, somebody has solved this problem ... cheaply.
