Subject: 79(80) Convert. Replacement Found...


First off...I'd like to thank everyone for their messages of
&quot;condolance&quot; regarding the recent demise of our 1979 
Convert. They were very much appreciated...and now reside
on my VW Archives disk...

Now, we had to replace the car...with something GERMAN and
FUN....well actually I HAD to replace my wife's car
with something German and fun, after all, the Convert.
was her Christmas present this year.

So folks here it is....taaaa daaaa!

1984 Porsche 944....62k miles....garaged in winter...sunroof...
cruise....leather....new Goodrich TAs....etc...etc...


We pick it up on Friday! Ok, its not an AIRCOOLED VW...but
the 944 was based on the 924 which was supposed to be a
VW/Audi sportscar...but VW chickened out at the last minute.

Ric
