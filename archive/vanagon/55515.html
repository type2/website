Subject: unstable idle
From: James Digennaro &lt;limbo_at_bcn_dot_net&gt;


Hi Dan,
   Saw your post about the unstable idle. Mine used to do the same thing.  I
think your problem is the idle to too high.   There are two switches on the
throttle body, one is a full throttle enrichment switch the other cuts the
fuel when decelerating.  When the engine is running above 1500-1800 RPMs and
the switch is  activated it cuts the fuel.  At idle the switch is bypassed
until the RPMs' are above 1500, then if the switch is still activated it
will cut the fuel.  The RPM's drop and the cycle starts again.   Unplugg the
switch and the engine idle will stablize.  Probably at a fast idle.   First,
you must figure out why the idle is fast, perhaps a vacume leak, the  timing
is off or the Aux air regulator is stuck open.   Once you determine the
problem and correct it reconnect the switch and everything will be fine.  IF
you find that everything is OK and the idle is still fast, then just turn in
the idle air screw on the throttle body until the idle seems normal (800
-950 RPMs).   That should do it. Good luck. Take care..
