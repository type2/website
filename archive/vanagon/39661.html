Subject: lost parts, a real bummer.

i was speaking with my chrome shop yesterday trying to figgure out where 
my safari window latches went to.  they can not seem to find them 
anywhere.  kinda makes me mad.  not only are these things real hard to 
find, but this particular set i made myself in machine shop.  they are 
irreplacable.  They guy told me to find out what the replacement cost 
would be.  I would love to see his face when i say that the two rights go 
for about $50 each and the lefts are not even available.  i bet he goes 
and looks for my pieces again.

has anybody else had a problem like this?  did they pay up on the goods?

does anybody have any extra safari latches out there for sale?

take care and God Bless
matt
