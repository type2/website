Subject: Re: TENT HELP!!!--How do I set up this !_at_#%$$%#^Tent

On Mon, 12 Feb 1996, Joe Chanin &lt;joe.chan_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have instructions, a manual or something that comes with the
&gt; tent?  Is iT small, can it be faxed?  I will be happy to pay for postage and
&gt; copying if necessary.  

My owners manual and campmobile instructions are long gone.

Here's how it goes from memory (forgive the ASCIIdoodle)...

Van sliding door is at the left side margin with red and
blue door flap on the other side. Not to scale.

I sure hope this does not get mangled and incorrectly formatted
as it's whisked through cyberspace.  Sorry if it does.
