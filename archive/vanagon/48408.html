Subject: '88 stalls when cold

Hello all,

Lately my '88 w/b has been stalling for the first few minutes when 
cold when coming to a stop. When restarting, it needs a bit of 
throttle (not much) to get going. Cranking it with no gas usually 
does not work, which is not normal for FI 

I've checked the microswitch on the throttle body - it's fine. It runs 
great otherwise, so I was hoping someone has had this problem &amp; can 
point out some quick checks. I don't have time to do a thorough check 
of everything now, since we're too busy camping... :)

ps: The idle is quite steady so I think the idle stabilizer is ok, it 
only seems to stall if pushing the clutch in at 2000 rpm +. One clue 
is that it now idles at ~900 when cold where it used to be at around 
1100 until warmed up.
