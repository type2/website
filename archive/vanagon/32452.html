&gt; There is a 12-volt deep-cycle gel-cell battery designed for wheelchairs that is

&gt; My question is, does this make sense?  Would they deliver enough power to be
&gt; worth the effort?  (I want to run a laptop with a draw of 1.5A, as well as
&gt; the lights in the van.)

64 Amp hours should be plenty for running a laptop and lights for a day 
or so.  But $160 for 64 AH seems like a lot of cash.  The only reason I 
can see paying that is for the convienence of having them under the 
driver's seat.  I think Martha paid about $160 for the two Trojan T-145 
batteries.  They are 6V each at 145 AH (I think).  But they are fairly 
large, and so they are stored under the rear seat.

David Schwarze installed them at Big Sur for her.  And installed a 25AH 
sealed battery under the driver seat last June.
