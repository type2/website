Subject: Re: Cats Onboard

I almost lost a cat in the middle of Bumf### Virginia, near 
Smithfield. For some reason my girlfriend wanted me to pull over, and 
when she opened the door the cat bolted out like it was on fire. We 
spent at least an hour in the cold dark rainy gully on the side of 
the road calling that cat. No flashlight, no food to lure it, 
finnally the pathetic wet rodent looking thing started crying in the 
woods and I was able to stumble thru the brush and find it.
When my new cat (ex-girlfriend got the other) is riding in the westy 
he stays on the leash. (a mad rush to the door ends quickly with a 
short leash!)

&gt; 
&gt;         That's why I bought the leash in Arizona. I had a harness and a
&gt; 6ft. leash, kept it on Tosca at all times, and kept the leash tied to the
&gt; Ebrake. Whenever he decided to be a brake pedal warmer, I just tugged him
&gt; out with the leash. I also had lots of stuff in the back, the leash kept
&gt; him out of it.
