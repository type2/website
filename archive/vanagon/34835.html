Subject: '82 Diesel FS

Geez, you drop out for a couple of days and the next thing you know, you 
have 600+ messages to read.  So, without checking if RVB posted this already:

'82 Euro Van, 7 pass., clean, diesel - with broken timing belt - $850 as 
is.  Wikieup, AZ, Fred Meischke (520) 765-2200.

This is from the Arizona VW Club newsletter.  I have no connection, etc. 
(and I'm pretty sure that is a Vanagon, not a EuroVan).
