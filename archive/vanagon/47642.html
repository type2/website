Subject: '74 Van for sale in Raleigh, nc


hey now,

there is a '74 Van for sale in Raleigh, cherry red paint job. i made a 
brief inspection of it...paint job looks new but maybe done by owner. 
looks great from a distance but you can tell it was homedone when you get 
close. no visible rust, interior looks clean but it's missing pannels. 
engine looks okay, maybe a slight oil leak...and it's missing the engine 
seal. straight looking bus thought. don't know how much they are asking 
for it...will check it out if anyone is interested.
