Hey Listees
        I received the sales brochure from KEP today. I phoned for it only
last week. It is extremely thorough and covers all aspects of putting a
Subaru motor into a Vanagon as well as many other conversions. Their prices
seem good and the information is top notch. If you're planning to repower
your vanagon I highly recommend getting their literature. However, it looks
to be an expensive brochure for them to put together so I wouldn't be
surprised if everyone on the list requested one they may want to charge for
them.
Good Luck, Here's looking at 130 Horses.
