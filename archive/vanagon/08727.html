&gt;I'll be camping in Yosemite the week between Monday, Dec. 26 and December
&gt;30, taking pictures and playing in the snow.
&gt;If anyone else on the list is planning to be there during this time, let me
&gt;know so we can meet, swap Vanagon stories, and watch our breath freeze.
&gt;I'll give any list members free photography instruction just to have some
&gt;company.

well, since EVERYBODY is getting into the act:

i'll be participating in a nude management seminar at the Slop 'n Gobble
Turkey Farm in Possum Fart, Alabama all next week. the seminar is free, but
you have to provide your own food (drinks are provided, but all you get are
RC Colas) and bedding ... unless, of course, you like to sleep on the floor.
anybody that's in the neighborhood, feel free to drop on down. :)

Merry Xmas, y'all.   ;)
