Subject: Re: EV price

&gt;Need a nod or a shake here,
&gt;
&gt;Got my third bid for the new EV with VR6 engine and all; $31570.  Anyone
&gt;got a comment on this?  Doggone nice bus; what power!!  Only trouble I
&gt;have is that I never thought I'd pay more for a car than my house...

Forget the VR6.  Hold out for the promised 120HP second generation TDI
diesel.  I have heard rumours it will be offered in '98.  I have driven a
Passat with a first generation (90hp) TDI diesel.  That motor is such a
work of art.  So much power and torque.  Are you sure it's a diesel you
will say.  Brought tears to my eyes.
