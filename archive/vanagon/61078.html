The O2 sensor light coming on basically means nothing.  The light is
connected to a mileage counter in line with the speedometer cable.  The
light has nothing to do with the condition of the oxygen sensor or exhaust.
 The light comes on every so often.  You reset it by pushing the white
button on the mileage counter box (can be found in line with the
speedometer cable, mounted near the spare tire carrier).

&gt; Ironically from the way back from the VW show, my OXS light came on.  
&gt; I went back to the discussion about open/closed loop, but didn't see 
&gt; anywhere what it means when the light comes on.  Anyone?  I presume 
&gt; it means either the O2 sensor has failed or there is another problem 
&gt; with the exhaust (e.g. hole).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
