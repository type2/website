Subject: dometic fridges

This may sound painfully obvious but it escaped me at first.  My fridge
takes a couple of HOURS to feel cool inside.  Having no RV fridge
experience, the first time I tried mine, I waited about fifteen minutes,
then assumed it wasn't working.  Talked to good-ol-Dad who had a good laugh
and said to wait a couple of hours, and voila!  it was cold!  

Regarding the CCC plastic bag burning debate - this reminds me of why I tend
to be a loner!
