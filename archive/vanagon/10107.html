&gt; If I will avoid becoming a casualty of a flamewar, I can offer copies of the
&gt; original Westfalia manual that came with my '74. All the photos are in black
&gt; and white so no-one will have to endure the overpowering ORANGE of the 
&gt; curtains and upholstery!

I'll go look for my '75 manual. Maybe I can scan it in somewhere...

&gt; '74 and '75 campers are unique, and after seeing the manuals I am sure you 
&gt; will all want one and, lucky for you, a pristine and complete interior 
&gt; should be available soon from a certain Sami Dakhlia who is *allowing* his
&gt; lovely bus to be rusted away in an uninhabitable part of the country. Whew.

But not for too long, Dave! That rusting away gives me that _added_
incentive to finish that thesis *really* quickly! 18 months top and I'll
move to Arizona or New-Mexico or similar. Promised! &lt;could also end
up in Southern France--but the bus stays with me, hear me?! :) &gt;
