Subject: Re: Timing lights



To All:

Engines are dynamic things.  A static timing light is a smart way to set the
base-line timing but once the engine is running you need a dynamic timing
light to dial it in.  In a high-time engine, the difference between cold
static timing and hot dynamic timing can be as much as five degrees due to
accumulated wear and other factors.  Getting your timing correct within one
or two percent is fine, if you can afford that amount of slop.   But one or
two percent on the wrong end of the scale can cost you an engine.  On the
other end of the scale that one or two percent can reflect a ten percent
reduction in fuel economy.

One reason I like CDI modules (and run them on everything I drive) is because
the timing stays dead-on for up to ten thousand miles, changing only as the
rubbing block and distributor components wear.

Modern ignition systems use a host of sensors and a microprocessor to provide
the most correct timing under all conditions.  The opposite end of that scale
is static (or mechanical) timing, which itself is a hold-over from the age of
steam (yes, you need to 'tune-up' a steam engine now and then) and is only
suitable for engines designed to run at a single speed.

Observing a degree wheel with a timing light provides an excellent reference
to the condition of the mechanicals in your distributor.  That small amount
of 'hunting' you see usually reflects wear in the distributor shaft bushings.
 If the thing is really jumping around, it would be wise to find out why.
