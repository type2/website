Finally, the facts behind the &quot;silent warranty.&quot;

When you read the section below, you'll thank God yet again that you're 
on this list and have access to it's archives:

&gt;Sometimes, showing the arbitrator that others have had
&gt;similar car failures can help indicate that the problem was
&gt;with the car rather than with your maintenance or driving
&gt;habits. For example, your mechanic may know of similar
&gt;failures; you may have seen (or be able to find) articles
&gt;about similar problems in your local newspaper or in car
&gt;magazines (check columns written by expert mechanics); and
&gt;your state or city consumer protection offices may be aware
&gt;of others with similar car problems or may have additional
&gt;information.

Great work Derek!!

Now we just need to find the settlement for Syncro transmissions (lest 
our Syncros all wind up on blocks in our front yard while we look for 
2nd jobs to cover the repair bills).
