Subject: Increase idle speed for air comditioner?

My 84 adventurewagon has aftermarket air cond.  When the air is on the idle
is so low it makes it a bit tough to drive away from a stop.  Is there a
way to increase the idle electrically when activating the air?  I've read
of the power steering idle increase, how is it accomplished?

thanks to all for any solution.
