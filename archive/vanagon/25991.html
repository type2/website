Subject: RE: heater blower project


&gt;Anyone installed the JCWhitney heater/blower kit? The 12V heater was an
&gt;appealing quick-fix and not very serious. How difficult is the
&gt;installation of the heater/blower?


I once put one of these (a used one) under the back seat of a squareback--
not the right place, I think they're supposed to go BEFORE the heater
boxes, not after. But it worked great, despite the fact that that little
blower must have gotten hot as h*ll from the heated air blowing through it.

My $0.02.
