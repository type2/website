Subject: Re: VW Engine Fires



&gt;&gt;Apparently the owner was a victim of the dreaded engine fire
&gt;
&gt;We've all heard of this, and/or seen it, in one form or another
&gt;I'm sure. Explanations abound, and no two are alike. Time for a
&gt;new, highly relevant thread?

        Hey Steve.  I have been familiar with the VW fire phenomenon for
some time.  I learned it before I bought my first bug, and knew it was
usually from old cracked fuel lines.  My first-things-first ritual upon
getting a &quot;new&quot; VW is to replace the fuel lines, and a halon fire
extinguisher.  Then I replace them every year or two after that.  Twenty
five cents per foot is cheap insurance.  There are three things in life it
is impossible to look intelligent doing:  walking down the highway with a
gas can, standing by while your dog assumes the position, and standing by
the side of the road next to a burning vehicle.
        When we bought our '79 bus a few years back I knew that the motor
had never been out, and I just went down and bought a few feet of hose.
Fuel injected cars use mulitple fuel lines.  When I climbed under the car to
check out the right side (return) hose, I could see it was cracked.  When I
reached up to handle it, it fell apart in my hand.  Some luck, huh?
        The problem is that the pieces of hose that fail are ones you have
to climb under the car and look for, and they operate in a very hot, dry air
environment.  Also, they aren't the ones you see while changing oil (You
have to look for them).
Add to this the fact that the little left side feed hose like you find on
bugs is located right above the left side heater box.  Leaking gas on an
exhaust manifold is an excellent way to start a quick fire.
        I haven't heard of carb fittings popping off, but I have seen some
bugs with a black patch over that area of the lid.  I figured it was from
some type of back-fire.  Maybe the problem you saw is more common than I
thought.  Stock carbs usually don't stay on my car for long, and I've never
had any leaking/fire problems with Kadrons or Dells.
        I would love to go public with this, but my Eudora mail setup is
screwed up and gives me a &quot;circular reference&quot; error when I try to mail to
&quot;the group&quot; or to Joel.  I'm going to try to fix it soon.  In the mean time,
feel free to pass on any text above.
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Later.

Alex, consider it done!   :)
