Subject: Re: '91 Vanagon engine fire


&gt;	We were lucky! Had the fire not been visible to the driver, and the
&gt;	  key been turned in the ignition, the engine and propane tank would
&gt;	  have in all likelyhood exploded.
&gt;

When my '86 burned up the propane tank did not explode.  The seals blew and
a jet of fire shot out to the drivers side for less than a minute until all
the propane was gone.  The gas tank didn't explode either, the tank melted
and the gas leaked out and burned on the ground.  The whole Van (westy)
burned for forty-five minutes before the fire dept. got to the scene.

I  was suprised that there was no explosions, I guess it ain't like the movies.
