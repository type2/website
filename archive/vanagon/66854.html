Subject:      87 GL flat spot

Hello; Recently my 87 GL has developed a flat spot at around 1600 to 2200
rpm. It feels like carberation to me, you step on it and either you get the
staggers/stutters, or not much of anything depending on the pitch of the
hill I'm facing.  A little (maybe) associated information, I'm suffering
with a marginal Idle air regulater, which sometimes works sometimes doesn't.
I've got good power at full throttle, still get 25 mpg and no other
complaints power-wise.  I'm sure many people have had this problem and
solved it in a smart(cheap) way.  I'd love to hear about it.
  Larry Carter
