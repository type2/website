Chris, 
I have a &quot;Bus Plus&quot; that you referred to.
It is an 1987 Wolf, Weekender with power steering, AC, 105k, electric
locks and mirrows. The color is metalic light blue with grey interior. 
The power steering rack has been replaced.  The maintenance has been by
the book since 70k.  I bought the van from a dealer who had full service
records on it.  He indicated I was the third person he had sold the van
to personally. The backwards, up chuck seats have been removed. Most
people that rode in them became car sick.

I feel like I am betraying a good friend because I am considering
selling it. My Vanagon has served me very well.  From Colorado ski trips
to fraternity national conventions in DC never a problem, well nothing
major. Now that I am out of college I am not using the Van as it
deserves to be used.  The more I follow the list I am afraid it may
become very expensive to maintain. (Heads, Trans and Cooling) 

I know it is only a car, but I have grown quite attached. I guess there
comes a time to say goodbye to an old friend.
