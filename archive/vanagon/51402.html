&lt;&lt; As I prolong the inevitable, what am I destroying?  Assuming the correct
 diagnosis (he said boot's slightly torn) &amp; considering labor cost, what
 options would you consider if you were me?  Preliminary cost queries
 revealed:  $77.42 just boot (outer joint kit??) or wheel shaft outer with
 251498099E outer joint $358.74 (Walser, AZ)  Monday I'll check for both
inner
 &amp; outer joints.  I've printed many posts from the '96 archives but will
 appreciate direct help re parts (rebuid good/bad idea?) and repair parts &amp;
 Volks in Frederick MD, Winchester &amp; Manassas VA triangle.        TIA!
