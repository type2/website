Subject: Westfalia Screen Repair Help Needed

Despite appearances, this is actually coming from Tom Brouillette, in 
care of Rachel Martin's e-mail address (I know, I know--I should get my own).

Does anyone have helpful hints on repairing the canvas screen on a Westy? 
I have one where not only is the mesh slightly ripped, but the stitching 
that holds the zipper in is all undone. A sewing machine is too big to 
lift up there, but it there an alternative to hand sewing it--maybe using 
a velcro kind of attachment? Any help would be appreciated.

Also, some of the side window screens on our Westy fleet have been broken 
in various ways (one but a curious &amp; hungry bear!). Repair seems a little 
difficult, does anyone have extras for sale (local junkyard does not). 
Any tips of fixing, replacing, substituting, etc.?
