&gt;No overrunning required-- they're quite happy to get rich selling it to us.
&gt;Everybody wins... until the oil runs out. By then we'll have developed
&gt;workable electric cars, and will be in the position that the oil countries
&gt;are in now. Except that we'll have gotten there, by sweating our brains
&gt;out in and R&amp;D effort, not by accidently finding ourselves over dead
&gt;dinosaurs' graves.

And where will we get the electricity? Electricty is not a fuel, it is
an energy transport media! 
Obbligatory ACVW:Of course everyone knows electricty, and water 
                 don't mix so they'll all be Air Cooled;-)
