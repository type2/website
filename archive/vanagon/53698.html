Subject: Brake Fluid Reservoir

I really feel dumb, but even with the owners manual open and the picture 
(which could be of anything) in front of me, I can't find the brake fluid 
reservoir on mt '85 Westy!  It says that it is located under the 
instrument cluster in the dashboard panel.  Can someone give me better 
directions and instructions as to how to open.  ALSO there is a little 
&quot;fill spout&quot; with a rubber plug over the top on the firewall of the 
drivers side (I think it was just above the break pedal (auto trans.-no 
clutch). What is this?
Thanks in advance
Wendy
