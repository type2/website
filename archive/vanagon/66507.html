Subject:      95 Eurobago sliding door

The sliding door power lock on my 95 Eurobago is giving me fits.  The
actuator does not push the button all the way up and the handle just jams.
If I pull up on the button manually it works OK.  I assumed it was the
actuator and swaped it with the one from the rear hatch.  No change! I
lubed (LPS like WD-40) the whole mechanism but no change.  Has anyone been
through this before?

Thanks in advance
