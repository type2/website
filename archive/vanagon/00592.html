Subject: Re: Electrical Idea(s)

Werner:

I interpreted no negative tone(s) and took no offense in your comments.
I've learned and accepted that whether I'm in suit and tie, T-shirt and
shorts, swim trunks or nothing at all, the person inside does not change;
only how I'm view by others!

Perhaps sometimes the sensitivity I'm feeling from dealing with Tripp
Light and the RV dealer in this matter may spill over and I'll try to be
more aware of that.

Tripp Light has placed a bad product on the market or they did a bad job
of defining conditions wherein this product should NOT be used. The RV
dealer-owner is be a complete jerk in this matter. Neither of this seem to
realize that they are generating the opposite of good will and eventually
bad press for their future business.

I do a lot of camping and outings. I have been performing in a
consultative role. In both respects, I frequently am in contact with
others that I can relay my experience(s) and recommendation(s) concerning
products like what Tripp Light makes and like the RV dealer sells. Right
now I can't say that I'll ever again recommend the purchase or use of
Tripp Light products (if there's a reasonable alternative). It's safe to
say that the &quot;years-long&quot; relationship between me and the RV dealer have
reached a parting of paths. Since I coordinate with an RV club in this
area, to some degree, the RV dealer has lost more than just my business.

With respect to advice being worth the price paid for it ... you are
completely correct but the addage &quot;let the buyer beware&quot; can be better
applied if we buyers spent more time making each other aware of our
successes and failures in the marketplace. I'd like to believe that I'm
somewhat even-handed here. (I can expect some have viewed me as strongly
biased based on my favorable comments about how I was treated by
Volkswagen and the VW dealer).

My comments about not being happy with Tripp Light products and your
comment about alternatives to reach the same goal that started this
whole effort make exchanges like this very worthwhile and, again, may help
someone else who had (has or will have) the same (or similar) idea about an
added electrical supply reach a happy conclusion make faster than I.

Thanks for participating!!
