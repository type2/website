&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From time to time, there has been a lot of conversation on various gas 
&gt; brands not working well in Vanagons. For those of you that LOVE to keep 
&gt; lists, why not keep a record of everyone's experiences with different 
&gt; brands that don't seem to work well.
&gt; I thought I remembered someone saying that anything with an alcohol blend 
&gt; doesn't work well - is that true? If so what brands routinely blend alcohol?
&gt; (Apart from Jim Beam :-)
&gt; Jack and his '86 Westy
&gt; 

Near where I live, in the San Francisco Bay area, the ARCO stations are
usually about 10-15 cents per gallon cheaper than the other major 
brands.  Close inspection of the pump shows that they cut their gas with
alcohol (10%).  There are off-brands in the economically disadvantaged
parts of town with prices that beat even the lowest ARCO price.  I've
never bought gas at any of these places, lest my van get stripped while
I was pumping the gas.

I usually gas up with Shell, since it's $1.17 this week, and Union 76 is
$1.19, and Chevron tips the scales at $1.29.  Have no problems to report
with either Shell or Chevron.
