&gt;&gt; Two trips, same route, so. Iowa to no. Michigan &amp; environs.

&gt;&gt;  First trip, in Die Frau, got lots of waves from other Breadloafers, but
&gt;&gt; only one from the dozen or so Vanagons we passed, much less *any* from those
&gt;&gt; snotty Eurovan drivers... ;)  Also got honks and waves from folks in
&gt;
&gt;Its these darned allergies.  All the decongestants and antihistamines and 
&gt;I'm still snotty......
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ordinary &lt;yawn&gt; cars, who no doubt were saying to their kids, &quot;Honey, look
&gt;&gt; at the old hippie van!  Hardly ever see *them* anymore!&quot;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Second trip, in Der Blaue Reiter, just about everybody waved, *even* a
&gt;&gt; Eurovan. But alas, no ordinary cars.  Vanagons don't attract non-VW
&gt;&gt; attention.  Is Blue than much more respectable than Die Frau?
