&gt;transporters go incredibly fast

YES!!!!!   Someone used the word TRANSPORTER!!!!!

Hold it: I'll bet it's not a T4 ...
:(

BTW - noticed that there are 2 (yes- two) vehicles in Ireland, 
according to Joel.  I'll remember that on my way around town in 
the morning. ;)
I'll stay quiet for the rest of the weekend (snif)

Shponfirkle,  (ancient Tazmanian Bushrat goodbye)

           Gremlin.       (Or PJ.   You decide. &lt;g&gt;)

***   Viva the Bushrats!   ***
***      Go Dale, #3!      ***
*** Happily seeking another Transporter ...
