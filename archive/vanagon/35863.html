Subject: re  EV paint cracks

&gt;
&gt;Hello everyone,
&gt;As a potential EV owner, I've been noticing the mention of cracks at the
&gt;A and B pillars. One of the early lessons I learned in the first bike
&gt;shop where I worked was that if the paint on the bicycle was cracked, the
&gt;metal underneath had been stressed. (Paint is not as flexible as metal.)
&gt;Has VW or their dealers given any explanation for these paint cracks?
&gt;
&gt;
Just that these are the welding joints. Where they happen is in this inset
groove in each pillar. A slight amount of flexing there seems possible. If
they show up again, then I'll worry.

Haven't you bought one yet? :-)
