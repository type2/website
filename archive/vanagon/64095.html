Subject: What list is this?

I think my list subscription has become fouled up or cross linked or
something.  Lately all I see are posts about law and consumer affairs,
flames and counterflames, with a few actual VW posts mixed in.

Enough already.  Give it a rest.  Don't even go there anymore.  We get the
idea.  Bus Boys Bad.  Bus Depot good.
