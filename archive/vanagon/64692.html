Anyone from Maine?  Joel says there are six of us.

How about a trip to Springfield, Maine this week end?  ...to see the
Springfield Fair and see who we are, too.  This fair is a guaranteed country
fair (look at your better maps ti even find Springfield!  The horse pulling
is heavy with horses coming from such places as Wittepitlock to show off.
There is a fire tower on Almanac Mt. where we might be able to set up for a
day or so in the wild...at least stay overnite once.

This fog should burn off before the weekend so we could see the views.

Here's to a chance,
