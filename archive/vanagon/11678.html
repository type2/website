Subject: Wasserboxers, cold galvanize


	Joel, 
	Having a comparativly rare VW engine (VR6) myself, I don't
think the wasserboxer has anything to appologize for. My friend who
has an Isuzu Trooper has had two problems with it that I know of:

	First, one of the spark plugs blew out of the head, taking
the threaded insert with it! After the warranty ran out, of course.
Anyone here ever have this problem? I thought not.

	Second, the distributor for his straight 4 just went south.
A new one costs $795. DOLLARS!!!! A rebuilt is a more reasonable
$200, to which my beloved brother wonders &quot;Gee, whats wrong with the
rebuilt?&quot; :-P

	Yeah, we pay outragous dealer prices, sometimes, but look what
we get in return! Farfegyadayada!!



	Schpornfirkle PJ! I'll try some of that cold-galvanize on my
pick-up bed scratches!


	Martha,
	I thought the Copley's had already driven through
Milpitas!

	Cheers, all!
	Bill
