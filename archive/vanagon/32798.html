I've finally straightened out the problem with the indexing engine.
You should be able to retrieve by category again.  Please let me know
if you have any problems.

	http://www.village_dot_org/vw/parts

For those that have just tuned in:

	This is the place to tell the world what parts you have or
	need for a Volkswagen Transporter.  Whether it's a MicroBus,
	Bus, Vanagon, Eurovan, Splittie, Breadloaf, Brick, Wedge,
	Syncro, Pickup, Kombi, Camper, or whatever, this is the place
	for parts.

If you want a listing on the page, you'll have to send me mail
directly, as I like to know that you really want to be listed, and a
lot of things on the list are reposts from newspapers or whatever.

	Dworkin
