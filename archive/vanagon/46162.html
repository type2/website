When in doubt about your particular flavor Air-cooled VW one must always
remember -

You drive it because you want to, nay need to.  You are the soul which
takes the road less traveled.

If it were just a matter of transportation let'sd face it we could all find
'more dependable' vehicles.  But we drives these because something in our
sould drives us to be different to get in touch with the motor. To know all
that which it does.

try THAT with you regular car.  Only air-cooled are VWs all else are just cars.
