Subject: Herbie (was Re: 1st Annual Love-Bug-Off....)

Speaking of Herbie, I recently saw an auction notice for &quot;Herbie, the Love
Bug&quot; in one of those big Auction catalogs (I can't remember the name, but
it's THE BIG, fancy classic car auction company). I wonder if it's REALLY
&quot;THE HERBIE.&quot; Then again, one has to wonder how much abuse ONE VW actually
could take in those movies. 8-)

Thanks Joe Fournier
       owner of &quot;Spot, the Loaf Bus&quot; (name temporary until primer spots are
                                      covered with something else.)

&gt;Yes, it is time for the annual fall return of our illustrious Love-Bug.
&gt;Not the small Beetle named Herbie, but the smaller flying insect found
&gt;joined to it's partner smooshed on your windsheild.  They are back in
&gt;droves and to celebrate we are having the first annual &quot;Love Bug Off&quot;
