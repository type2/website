&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ..sorry, I missed the beginning of this thread, but something similar
&gt;&gt; happened to my '78 Scirocco a while back at about 110,000 mi.  I took
&gt;&gt; the odometer apart myself and *carefully* applied some superglue to the
&gt;&gt; nylon gear (it had split so that it formed a 'c' instead of an 'o', an
&gt;&gt; thus no longer followed the odometer axle as it turned.)  That was 3
&gt;&gt; years and 40,000mi ago and no prob since.

&gt;
&gt;The problem with doing this is that because the gear teeth on the cracked gear
&gt;have spread apart, in many case they won't line up with the mating gear.  Over
&gt;time the broken gear just chews up it's opposite member so that you wind up 
&gt;having to replace both of them.  Better to just replace the broken gear in the
&gt;first place.  You got lucky, Joachim.

I'll keep that in mind.  Knock on wood... I hope I stay lucky :^)
