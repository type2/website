Subject: VW 1980 Camper Tires


I need some tire advice.  I have a 1980 Vanagon Camper, and I need to buy 
two new back tires.
On the front I have Michelin xch4's.
I can get the Yokohama Y370's for $69.95 each from a local tire place.
Also, he mentioned a Michelin XZ4 for $85.95 each.

The Y370's are 195 75 14's, and the XZ4's are 185 R 14's.

Any suggestions on brands or the two sizes?
I would appreciate any help.
Thanks,

	Kyle
