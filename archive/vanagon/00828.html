Subject: Rebuild help please!


Well, I see the error of my ways.  A while back I posted to ask if anyone
could suggest a source for a rebuilt engine and got no replies.  So, I see
the light, and will attempt a rebuild myself...

I have pulled all of the sheet metal off and pulled the heads and cylinders.
It looks really bad!  There is a big chunk of head missing by the #1 exhaust
valve, and the forward cylinders both have seize marks.  Looks like I'm 
going to have to replace the heads, cylinders and pistons for big $$$.  And
of course the &amp;(_at_#$%^^#^ thermostat!!

Anyway, if anyone of you air-cooled gurus can suggest anything I should do
while I have the beast in pieces, please advise me.  This is the first time
I have ever done anything of this magnitude for my car.  What should I 
check for?  What should always be replaced?  

Thanks in advance for your help,

Albrecht  '82 3-cylinder :-( Vanagon   (I'm in St. Louis, MO, B.T.W.)
