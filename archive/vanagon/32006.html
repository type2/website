Progress...

&gt;      On the road yesterday, I saw a very late Vanagon in Carat
&gt;      trim. The interior layout was unusual; club seating.
&gt;      Two rear facing seats backed up behind the driver and shotgun
&gt;      seats. The usual three person bench in back. If I'm not
&gt;      mistaken there was a table set up between the two rows of
&gt;      rear seats. Seems great for a family with kids, they can all
&gt;      color or whatever on the table in backlike our son does in
&gt;      the Westie, but it still seats seven.

On the EV they call this an MV (MultiVan in Europe if I remember) I think 
it might be the same in T3 generation.  EV MV is whats I gots...  Makes 
it the most useful of the mini-midi-full size or VW vans in my opinion.

A T3 type will have to verify the name's the same.

&gt;      Can you get a carat with a stick ;-)?

Cute...

If you get this Tom and your still looking for an ISP - check Erols its 
cheap but they don't know what they're doing.  I'm quite happy with 
Quantum but its on my side of the river for the most part.
