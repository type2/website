Subject: Re: two-bulb rear taillights on splitties?

     &gt;I was just wondering what year(s) VW put the two-bulb taillights in 
     &gt;splitties. The only ones I've ever seen have ben one-bulb (`59-66, 
     &gt;mostly.) and was wondering if they did this for the `67's or 
     &gt;something.
     
     in the UK, it was around the 63/64 bullets to fisheyes change over 
     period.
     
     Lee.
