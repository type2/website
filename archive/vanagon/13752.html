Subject: Canadian Camper Rentals?

We are planing a trip to Nova Scotia, Canada this summer.  We want to spend
a couple of weeks camping, but we will be flying and won't be able to bring
our Westy :(  Does anyone know of a canadian company which rents VW campers
or even a Winnebago rental place?  You know, like 1-800-Cruise USA (or
whatever it is).  Any suggestions from our canadian friends?
