Subject: First timer needs advice...

I'm currently in search of my first vanagon and have my mind set on a 
syncro.  Is this a wise choice - or should I stick with the 2wd variety. 
Reading all the postings regarding syncros, I've begun to think 
twice...not so much about purchase price but about the associated costs 
down the road.  I do not travel off road that often but the security of 
awd/4wd is comforting.  My Cherokee died recently and my Jetta is not 
cutting the mustard.  Some friendly advice on the matter is appreciated.

thanks
