Subject: East Coast Last Call
Date: Wed, 15 Feb 95 10:19:57 EST
From: Richard &lt;rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu&gt;

 All right, east coast brothers and sisters, the time is approaching.
The weather is supposed to be warming up nicely, around 60's as the
weekend highs, lows in the 40's. Cloudy, with perhaps a chance of rain,
but that seems to be par for the course. If anyone needs directions on
how to get there, please e-mail me, and I shall happily respond. Other
than that, hope to see everyone there.
  Oh, someone PLEASE bring a good camera, so we can get some pictures.
Everyone bring food, and we'll see what shapes up as far as meals...
thanks, and hope to see a lot of folks there!
Richard





&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   They have 100 spaces available now, 6 people per space (as many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vehicles as you can fit! ) and it's $9.00 for a regular space, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; $14.00 for a space with a power hook-up (this is per space, not per
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person) The park gates are open 8 am - 6 pm, and the number for all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wishing further details is 1-919-362-0586. This is the park office, open
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9-5. As Isaid, this is on a lake, with trails to hike, etc. I have talked
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to several people that have been there, and they all said it was nice.
