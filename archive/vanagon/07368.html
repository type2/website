	Well, if you really want to do a stretch, why not use both
the front and rear parts? Two sets of steering wheels, two sets of
powered wheels, two middles in the middle. Like those big airport 
fire trucks. With four front wheels, power steering would be a very good
idea...

	In the Pink Floyd Carrara Panamerica tape, there's a piece
of 50s film showing a Cadillac with what looks like a T-6 airplane
canopy in place of the normal cab.

	If anyone does see one or more of those Revell model kits of
split windows or Vanagons, I'll be happy to pay for them and postage.
It would be fun to see what a couple of these ideas would really 
look like. $15.00 per kit, let me know when you find one and I'll
send you a check.

	Bill
