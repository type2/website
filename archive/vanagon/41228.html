Unless it's very different on the EV, one should *never* use any kind of
wrench to tighten an oil filter!  If you do, you are apt to have a bear
of a time trying to get it off three months or so down the road. Instead,
simply *hand tighten* the filter. Check your owner's manual to be sure,
but a common recommendation is to hand tighten until the filter's gasket
comes in contact with the engine then turn an additional quarter or half
turn.
