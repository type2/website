Subject: Typ II Ent. Out Of Biz

I called Type II Enterprises in a quest for my floor mats (714-895-1164) and
someone answered from their home and said the company had gone out of
business and this phone number was now theirs..

I sort of remember that Bus Boys had once gone bankrupt (am I right?). 

I guess serving us Type II people is a hard way to make a living!
