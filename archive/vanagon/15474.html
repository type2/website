So Bradley says:
&gt; &gt; &gt; HaHa, so you pee'd out of the vent windows yet? The only solution to your 
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem that I've found is to go out the front door, just pull in on the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; door handle as you open the latch. Less of a telltale 'pop' that way. tim s.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Or.... You can get a porta-potti.
&gt; 
&gt; What are y'all doing, drinking a couple pots off extra stong coffee
&gt; before going to sleep?  Is it bladder infections from eating to many
&gt; prunes?  I'm sure Steve can testify to my drinking habits, and I seem to
&gt; be able to last a night. 

Sure, I'll testify,  ;)

With all the alcohol you consume Bradley dude, I would presume all the
other excess moisture gets absorbed! eh?  ;)
