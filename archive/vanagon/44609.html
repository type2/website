Subject: Re: It's a Keeper! (long)

&gt;chrome emblem glinting in the afternoon sun.  Trying to compose myself I 
&gt;walked into the barn and was greeted by Ralph Flores, 75 year old 
&gt;original owner of this gorgeous '64 Deluxe.  We exchanged pleasantries 
&gt;and I proceeded to look over the Bus.

Congrats, Bob!  I would've replied sooner, but I couldn't find my keyboard
under all this drool!

&gt;rubber seals looked new, the upholstery was covered in clear plastic 
&gt;covers (done the week it was purchased).  The headliner was perfect, all 

Just checking: This isn't one of those Friday-too good to be true-&quot;gotcha&quot;
posts is it?  If it isn't, I think I'm feeling a little light headed about now.

&gt;... The rear deck had a rectangular 
&gt;hole cut in it just above the pully (which is a double pully).  The owner 
&gt;was also an airplane mechanic and drove a generator (mounted in the 
&gt;luggage area) off of the VW motor as he worked &quot;in the field&quot;.

I have a double pulley for a 1600 engine that I took off an air conditioned
bug motor.  I was thinking of installing it on my bus motor and fabricating
a setup with a pulley and shaft so I could drive a saw or some other
practical device in remote locales.  Only problem is I have no practical
needs for such a practical setup (rendering this whole scheme unpractical),
and I primarily just think it would be neat to do.  Any suggestions on
&quot;practical&quot; engine driven tools/well drillers/missile launchers I could make
from my double pulley to get me motivated?
