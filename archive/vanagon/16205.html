Subject:      Stale Air Heating vs Fresh

                       'Stale Air' Heating

VW made a big thing of their 'Fresh Air' heating system when they
changed over from the 36hp.  The bigger blower housing
incorporated a pair of air channels ducted directly to the heat
exchangers; before, cabin heat was provided by air that had been
used to cool the engine, and often picked up exhaust fumes or
stank of oil, hence the emphasis on 'Fresh' air.

Since about 1961 Volkswagen cabin heat has been provided by the
waste heat from two the engine's four cylinders; air-flow is
governed by engine speed and an adjustable flapper valve in each
heat exchanger.  The heating system functions as an 'open-loop'
or 'one-pass' system; you'll have to open a window or wind-wing
to provide an exhaust otherwise the flow of heated air will
depend on cabin leakage, which is quite small on the tightly
built VW's.  But as the outside air temperature falls, so too
will the amount of cabin heat.  Because of the one-pass design,
by the time the outside air temperature approaches zero degrees
Fahrenheit, the cabin temp will be hovering around the freezing
point; heavy woolens are the uniform of the day.  The problem is
even worse in the Transporter, with its larger surface areas and
greater interior volume.  In below-freezing weather the
Transporter's heating system is inadequate.  A gasoline-burning
auxiliary heater is the quick and easy solution.  And the
expensive one.

Re-upholstering, with heavy use of urethane insulation, can
improve the cold-weather comfort factor of both bug and
Transporter but there is another solution that's often
overlooked.  That solution is to convert the heating system into
a closed-loop or multiple-pass design, as is used in most modern
automobiles.

                  Recirculating Heating Systems

Multiple-pass heating means passing the same air through the
heater a multiple number of times.  Since the air picks up more
heat on each pass, even an un-insulated Transporter can be
brought to a toasty temperature on a cold winter day.

Converting an early VW to use multiple-pass heating is quite
simple:  Install a fan and ducts to recirculate the cabin air
through the heat exchangers.  The heated air is returned to the
cabin through the existing heater ducts.  There are kits of parts
available from J.C.Whitney (and others) that will let you convert
your present system to a recirculating system.  But there's no
such thing as a free lunch; there are some good points and some
bad points associated with Stale Air heating.

The good news is the thing works.  If you're tired of numb
fingers and rubbing the windscreen with an old sock, throw in one
of the kits and learn how to sweat again.

The bad news is that the quality of the kits is generally poor,
and they want you to chop a humongous hole in your firewall for
the return-duct.  Given the name and purpose of that particular
bulkhead, this isn't the smartest thing to do to your vehicle.
Besides provide a passage for smoke &amp; flames should you have a
bad day, the firewall opening also makes a handy path for engine
noise.

The poor quality of the kits shows up as shoddy hardware, cheap
ducting and a noisy blower motor.  Given the cost of the thing
(about $100 for a bus, $85 for a bug), you could probably do
better prowling the junk yards in hopes of modifying the blower &amp;
ducting from another make.

Bus owners make out like bandits with recirculating heater kits
because they can hide them under the rear seat, down beside the
rear heater box (reference here is to an older bus).  But the kit
makers want the bug owners to mount the thing behind the rear
seat, hence the need for the hole in the firewall.

I've not tried this but I think it would be possible to mount the
recirculating blower under the rear seat of the bug as well as
the bus.  The ducting is more of a problem but a permanent
solution would be the use of formed fiberglas ducting.  If
anyone's interested in how such ducts are formed and made (they
are fairly common in aircraft) I'll be happy to provide details.

                          But First...

Freezing temperatures usually go with corrosive road salts (as a
native Californian I'm not quite clear on which came first...)
and many heater-no-work complaints have to do with rusted out
heat exchangers or ducting, especially on the bus.  Before
considering a Stale Air heating system you need to insure the
stock system is in good condition and working properly.

Should you wish to cobble up your own recirculation system be
sure to use a variable-speed fan.  Indeed, if you're a confirmed
tinkerer you can rig a thermostat to the system, giving your
thirty year old VW all the winter-time comfort and convenience of
a modern automobile.

                           Sermonette

It's about 80 degrees as I write this (April, 1995), a lovely
spring day in southern California.  And the perfect time to work
on your heater, oil your tire chains and do other chores
associated with winter driving.  If you wait until the first
freeze you've missed both the point of this sermonette and a
summer's-worth of opportunity.
