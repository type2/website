&gt; Subject: Wanted, 70's VW westfalia camper
&gt;
&gt;  I am desperately searching for a 70's, prefer 78 or 79, VW
&gt;westfalia,
&gt;  will travel anywhere in the country to find the right one. Email me
&gt;if
&gt;  you have one to sell
&gt;
&gt;  Peace,

There is a '78 for sale at Dune Buggy Supply in Hopkins, MN, the same place
that is storing/repairing the '65 deluxe I posted earlier.  They have an ad
in the August issue of the Twin Cities Volkswagen Club Newsletter that reads:

&quot;1978 VW Bus, camper, runs well, some surface rust $1500.&quot; 

Their number is 612 (I remembered the area code this time!) 938-8877 and they
are open 0800 to 1800 weekdays.

They have 5 other busses listed from 1960 to 1978, plus other air and water
cooleds.  I, personally,can't say how they are as I have never dealt with
them but since someone decided that they REALLY liked the outside mirrors on
my Rabbit, and they have watercooled parts, I may give them a call tomorrow.

1972 (SLOWLY getting together) Westfalia
1981 (Can't see behind me) Rabbit (diesel, 270,00+ miles, and still 40+ mpg)
