Subject: questions...

Hey all,
I just have a few quick questions.

1) Is it possible to replace the valve cover gaskets on a '78 2.0L with the
enginei n the bus?  Mine are leaking a bit, probably not helped by my recent
overheating.  They look accessible, but I just want to make sure.

2) Is it possible to replace the pushrod tube seals with the engine in.  If it's
possible is it easy or is it a huge pain in the ass that's really not worth it?
I would imagine the heads would have to be pulled out slightly from the
cylinders to let the tubes drop out and then re-install.  How the hell do you
line all four of them up at one time to re-install the head?  Just curious.

3) I imagine it's completely out of the question to replace the oil cooler
gaskets with the engine in, at least not without a LOT  of disassembly.  True?

4) brakes.  I read with interest kyle's description of a failing master
cylinder.  Here are my symptoms.  Remember, '78 with power brakes.  Basically,
brake pedal height varies.  sometimes pedal height is high and brakes are firm,
other times pedal is somewhat low and brakes seem slightly spongier, but not
air-in-the-lines spongy.  Braking pedal effort is always low, i.e. power assist
works fine.  What may cause this condition?  drum brakes out of adjustment
maybe?  failing master cylinder?  I really hate brake work but if my master
cylinder is going to suddenly fail, I want to do something about it.

5) brake-related:  does the rear hub nut (that god-awful big one) have to be
removed to remove the rear drums?  There are two bolts threaded into the drums
in between lug nuts, are these for removal, i.e., turn bolts in and drum pops
off?  The 4Runner has a setup exactly like that.  

Thanks for all help, I appreciate it already.

Sean
