Subject: RE:Vanagon Mailing List Split

Hi folks! I think that we all belong to the wonderful world of the VW
brick-shaped vehicles.  So why split them in two groups? In my case
if I read something about watercoolers I will understand that we are talking
about Corrados, GTIs, etc. Let's keep the armony among the VW lovers.
Peace forever
