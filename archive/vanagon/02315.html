&gt;My 1984 Vanagon GL had rear speakers at one time.  I still have them ...

do you want 'original equipment'? or just some more speakers to put back
there? if just more speakers, check radio shack for some surface mount
speakers, ranging from $30 to $60 per pair. they are wider than the vw
originals (3-3/4 x 8-1/8 x 4-1/4) but don't sound like they hang down
much more. jcwhitney also has some similar surface mount speakers.

for original stuff, try calling some of the vw dealers in the back of the
vw and porsche magazines (the ones that have 800 numbers). like
Timmons VW, Long Beach, CA (800) 266-3247.  also if you can find somebody
that sells Bosch auto-audio stuff, you might find something there.
