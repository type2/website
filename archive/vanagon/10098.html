&gt; I will not be able to attend the gathering on GW's birthday after all.  Our 8th 
&gt; grade is going to an environmental camp on in South Carolina from 12 through 17 
&gt; Feb so the timing is bad for me.  (I am the administrator for those grade 
&gt; levels.)
&gt; 
&gt; I had hoped to link up with Dave or Don out of Atlanta and caravan but the 
&gt; timing is just too tight.  We won't be back until the wee hours of Friday 
&gt; morning :( 
&gt; 
Sorry to hear it; sure you can't just toodle on up from South Carolina???
Anyway, tell your friends to come anyway, if there is an interest...
Richard
