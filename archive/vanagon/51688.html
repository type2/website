On another related subject, the PO had the gas tank replaced just   before
we purchased the vehicle.  I can't for the life of me prevent   the tank
from overflowing when filling up, unless I use miniscule   pressure at the
pump.  Does anyone have any pointers as to what, if   anything, may be
wrong.  Or is this a feature?
Comment;

Check the &quot;y&quot; -shaped pipe which connect to the two expansion tanks under
the car,  Feel above the gas tank.  Access the plastic pipe by hand through
the wheel well, above the wheel and to the center of the top of the tank. 
It is brittle with age plastic and has a reputation for cracking and
causing leaking upon fillup.  Part cost at VW is about $32.00 including
four grommets.  You'll need stainless steel hose clamps, too.  If your
problem is that plastic pipe, you can change it out by a series of wheel
turning, front of vehicle raised, drop the spare-contortions.  You won't
have to remove the gas tank.  Most VW fixers I've talked to, with the
exception of those on this list, say it's a removal of the tank process. 
Not so.  See the archives for a piece by Joel and commentary by others.

Other possibility is the filler pipe grommet.  If the PO failed to set that
properly, it may be a cause.
