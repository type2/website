In a message dated 96-01-11 05:25:01 EST, you write:

&gt;I recently fitted and am running a bosch blue coil because it was easy to 
&gt;get hold of when mine died. However I noticed that people think I should 
&gt;have a ballast resistor, which it doesn't have. What damage will I do, 
&gt;and where can I get a ballast resistor etc.
&gt;
&gt;
I've been running a bosch blue coil for 3 years now with no ballast resistor.
 No problems to date.
