Subject: Replace my dash clock - 83.5

        Since my console  clock is fried, and I already have a digital clock
on my stereo, are there any other gauges that would pop right in where the
clock was? I put a Tach in last year, am thinking it might be smart to put
in either an oil pressure, or an oil temp gauge.
        There must be something that fits right in there...........i hope.

gracious mon amigos. 

        oh.....and to make you all feel better.....up here in Edmonton we
woke up to 5 inches of wet heavy snow and +3 weather. Its May for *(&amp;^#
sake. And to think some people dont believe the hype about the global
weather system getting all crazy.
