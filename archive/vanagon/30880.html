Subject: sunroof like in Jurassic Park
Date: Fri, 15 Dec 1995 13:57:27 -0600 (CST)

This being Friday, let me share one of the crazier ideas concocted in my
VW obsessed mind. David Schwarze started it, though. As we admired our
busses, he said: &quot;you know, if I were you, I'd put a sunroof where your
luggage rack is right now.&quot; &quot;Mmmh,&quot; I replied, &quot;cool thought, but we still
need something to seal off the closed pop-top.&quot; 

I really wish I had a sunroof to expand the angle of vision and double the
pleasures of sight-seeing. With a wide sunroof reaching far down towards
the windshield, we could see summets during mountainous drives. Now do you
remember the plexiglass roofs on the Ford Explorers in &quot;Jurassic Park?&quot;
Couldn't something similar replace the Westie's front luggage rack? The
seals along the roof and the pop-top would be the same, but the plexiglass
roof would be more wedge-shaped for better looks and aerodynamics.

Now am I crrrazy, or what? :)
