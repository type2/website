Tim P. thus pondered:

&gt;Yep, therein lies my quandry.  Do I stick with the EV and VW because I'm a
&gt;loyal subject and on the assumption that it's just taking my dealer a
&gt;little longer with this vehicle to work out the &quot;bugs&quot; and that it'll end
&gt;up being a good van for a lot of years of driving?  Or do I cut my losses
&gt;before they become real fiscal losses and bail as soon as I can, taking
&gt;VW's apparent attitude toward the van as a &quot;sign&quot; and go out and buy
&gt;another Jellybean van???  Only had to fix a faulty starter on that one,

I think it's safe to say that many of us on this list have been in a similar
situation and frame of mind; back when I, too, owned a SB, someone
once said that when there was nothing wrong (w/ a VW), there was no
car in the world better, but when it hit the skids, you didn't want to be
anywhere near one, and I think that's pretty true, which is why we 
still have an all-VW motorpool  (I know... I like playing w/ fire...)

Steve's suggestion of hunting down that electronics demon is a very
good one and we're all sitting here betting that's at the root of your
van's troubles, so damn the MGs...ya gotta do what ya gotta do....

Personally, I'd stick this one out and make sure the REAL problem's
fixed.  Who's to say the Previa (too bad the manf. is Toyota, not
Placenta) isn't going to have problems of its own?  At least you know
where you stand w/ the EV.  Of course, if there starts to be a lot of 0's
after that first number on the bill, well, all bets are off.

BTW, that narrow angle V6 is a 15 degree V and was designed to
occupy the same amount of bay space as the I-4's.  While it's a
wonderful engine, I wouldn't necessarily expect better reliability w/
neck-snapping speed to come w/ the VR6 Eurovan (if it ever makes
it to dealers here).  I know, Tim, what you really want is a 6.2 liter
Cummins diesel shoved into the front of your EV; you got a tough
truck engine, early warning, good mileage, AND you can haul your
house around w/ you wherever you go!   ;-)

Hang in there!
