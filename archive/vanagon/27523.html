Hey Thom:
I'm curious as to what you did... Sounds like u lose the visablility out
the hatch window.  Here in boston, I need all the windows in my van to
make sure the $%8_at_?#! co-commuters aren't going to pull some lame manuveurs
and take me out.  I experience the same draft through my canvass cover
and was thinking about installing an interior canvass cover to snap
along the roof with weather stripping ... but haven't come up with a
good plan yet.  The BA-6 gas heater still does a good job in the
cab area.
