... and Santa Cruz is just outside the pearly gates of VW heaven -- as close
as you get on Earth!  Aside from some fog, this really is one of the nicest
places anybody could ever want to relocate to.

Not for me (actually, the Yosemite area is real nice, too).  But some of
you young bus nuts...  Beaches and surfing (some of the best).  Great food
and music, great weather.   Go for it!  Give Kyle a call.  I would consider
doing it if I were single, had no kids and was 20 years younger...
