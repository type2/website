Subject: CB Performance Fuel Injection system
Date: Tue, 28 May 1996 04:56:35 GMT

Has anyone actually purchased and used a fuel injection system from CB
Performance for a VW type 1 or type 4? Either their CFI open circuit
system or the more expensive closed circuit system.

I'm considering one but have yet to find anyone who has actually
bought and used one. I'd like to hear from anyone who has, good and
bad points. Any installation or setup problems?  I know I'll have to
add larger gas line and a return line. I saw the article in either VW
Trends or Hot VW (don't remember which) but you know how those can be.

I'm sure there are others out there who would like to hear. Please
also email any reply to alternate address below since my connection
can be erratic.

Thanks,
