Good Morning Volks,

I know it's too damn early but I'm waiting for my coffee to finish brewing.

Does anyone know how to remove the luggage rack portion of the roof on 
a 76 Westy?  There are 4 screw in the front and then 4 bolts in the back 
where the roof closes but the bolts are those ones that are flat on top and I 
can't figure out how to get them off.  I suspect i have to remove the 
healiner above the front seats and undo the nuts that way, but the 
headliner is in there really good and I can't get it to budge.   Why am I 
doing this you ask??   Well, call me weird but I'm painting the roof a 
different color and I want to sand it down and put a new seal on it .  I 
figured that removing it would make the process a whole lot quicker and 
easier - especially gluing on the seal.  Anyone ever done this??

Secondly,  I know everyone is tired to death of this subject but I think I 
might have missed something.  I went in to a Michelin to get 2 rear tires.  
The ones I have on it are P195 75R 14.  The guy told me that those were 
for cars and that Westfalia's need the reinforced sidewall LT tires.  I 
thought that was just for the later model Vanagons and not breadloafs??  
Of course the price for one of these was what I was looking at for 2 of the 
regular ones.  Does this sound right or am I getting the runaround??  The 
old tires have been fine since I had the van  (PO was a VW mechanic so I 
figured he knew what was going on).  Any responses are welcome.  TIA.

I'm on digest mode so e-mail me direct if you want me to see it right away.
