Subject: 71:Carb/ ?Idiot Factor?

Hey, maybe we're seeing the idiot factor in progress with my '71?

I just went out and cranked it over...listen...think. When I first start 
it (it's cold), the thing purrs like nobody's business. I accelerate and 
it responds just like I want it to the rest of the time. NO PROBLEM. I 
leave her running. She warms up. I accelerate. Flat....I tweek 
timing...accelerate. Flat.

Hmmm what's different when cold and once warmed up? Choke engages...upper 
plate in carb opens. More air. I adjust the therostat and let her warm up 
again. Doesn't matter.

Okay, maybe it has to do with pressure forced through. I look at air 
cleaner. When I press the accelerator, a little plate opens up in the air 
cleaner letting air in from the engine compartment. 

Hey, wait a minute.  There's this little connection underneath the air
cleaner for a flexible hose. And there's this little channel I installed
with the engine tin called a pre-heater channel (or something like that).
It's supposed to help the carb heat up in the winter time. The way I've
got it installed, it feeds warm air into the engine compartment. That
would help the carb, right?  But what if I hooked it up to the air
cleaner? That would send warm air right into that carb; it would change
the pressure some. Hmmmm, I wonder.  Could the lack of this hose be part
of my problem? Could it be all of my problem? 

I can't get this stuff tonight. Watching kids. Too cold to take the sick 
one out. But tomorrow, bright and early (or maybe tonight after Kristy 
comes home from work), I'm off to FLAPS to get that hose.

Even if this turns out to be my problem, I won't feel too bad. I've done 
(and read about) dumber things. 'sides, that would be a WHOLE lot 
easier than the other possibilities. 8) Joe

P.S. What do you think? Could this be the problem?
