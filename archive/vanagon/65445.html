Subject:      Fridge upgrade installed

HIGH ALTITUDE FRIDGE UPGRADE INSTALLED....

Just picked up my 1995 eurobago with the upgrade.

What was done:
-added extra vent by cutting another hole in side of van
-new burner
-you can now see the pilot light when looking at the bottom of
the fridge along the floor
-cost:  123.20 for the part
-labor covered under warrenty

Result:
-i got there and it didn't work!  Thing wouldn't work
-fridge taken apart and reassembled then it worked (no problem found)
-i am sick and tired of dealing with this fridge

More info:
It has taken about a month to get this work done.  Delay in parts due to UPS
and parts missing as well as the dealership not being aware of the problem.  I
told the service manager  i was disappointed that i was being charged for
anything and listed a bunch of prepared reasons (as gather from the list).
service manager did treat me in what a felt was a good manner even though he
Thestill charged me for some the amount.  3.5 hours of labour was covered.  He
said they are treating the upgrade like they would if you were buying the van
new from the factory.  Basically, it is the cost of the factory option which
is the cost of the part.

Advice:
If you want to upgrade....get a bucket and some ice.  I was hoping that the
fridge upgrade would make it more reliable.  I think as norcold fridge owers
we need to work as a group and look for a recall.  Not extended warrenty, but
recall.  I think it is simply a crap shoot whether the fridge is going to
light.   One might want to wait and see how my fridge does before upgrading
their fridge.

Thank-you for the support and information on dealing this this problem.

Chris
