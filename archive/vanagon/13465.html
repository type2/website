too my knowledge, what you have is a camperized version of what was
originally. If it is a authentic Westfalia (VW authorized camper
conversion) there will be a brass placque just below the bed on the
bulkhead (on the pass. side of the bulkhead). WEsty interiors for 1967 had
fake wood arborite, or something like that.

michael&gt;I'm too lazy to quote from a digest right now, but I'm a little
confused
&gt;about the definition of &quot;Kombi&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;I saw someone mentioned that a C/Kombi was a bus that had removeable
&gt;seats and could function as a passenger and cargo hauler.
&gt;
&gt;I own what I _think_ is a '67 Kombi.  Everything I've seen (which is
&gt;probably not much) has led me to believe this.  My bus has 11 windows (2
&gt;front windshields, one per door, 1 rear, and three tilt-outs on each
&gt;side).  It came with a 'camper style' interior with a fold out bed, two
&gt;'closets' on top of the engine hump, and a variety of fold out tables,
&gt;storage spaces, and other such things.  It is a walk thru, and has a
&gt;solid roof (no pop top, no sun roof).  It still has the tent/awning rail.
&gt;
&gt;I've been told/led to believe that it is a Kombi.  Am I right?
&gt;
&gt;Just confused,
&gt;
