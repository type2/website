Subject: AC Belt size?

Hello All,
	I am reassembling my '81 2 lt engine and it is missing a
belt for the AC.  The belt was not there when I took it apart.  The
AC compressor has a tag on it that says it was made by a company
named &quot;York.&quot;  The Bently does not mention a belt size for this
accessory, it must be dealer added.  The compressor seems to work
but it has been vented, I would like to add the belt now and try to
get it working later.  If anyone has a belt for one of these and
can tell me the size I would appreciate it. 

	Thank You.
