My wifes 85 GL could use a compressor and condensor . Do you know if
yours are compatible? How much are you asking?

&gt;I am parting out an 88 vanagon.  parts available include auto trans, 
&gt;fuel
&gt;injection parts, interior, glass, and A/C parts.  Also full suspension
&gt;pieces,  Steering rack and engine spoken for.
&gt;
&gt;E-mail for needs. No reasonable offers refused.  Whatever does not get 
&gt;sold
&gt;will have to be scrapped as I have no room to store the parts.
