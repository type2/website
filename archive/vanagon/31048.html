Subject: New Year's Eve party


A significant number of you have indicated that you want to come to this
party, so it's still on.  Please RSVP (open to the whole list, of course)
and I'll e-mail you directions.

Guess we can do potluck again.  

Anyone who wants to come early and stay over night to avoid being out on
the highway with the (other) drunks is welcome to crash here, as usual.

Let me know....
