Subject: Re: Eurovan prices

&gt;Over the past year (yes, it is an obsession) I've been 
&gt;shopping for a Eurovan. While I know VW dealers are going to 
&gt;be more than non-VW dealers, and dealers in general are more 
&gt;expensive than individuals, it seems the Eurovans command 
&gt;premium prices beyond blue book and competing vans' prices.

I have found the same thing, been looking for 4 months.
Found a nice 86' Westy with 69K no rust but leaky heads
poor brakes, rusted cat &amp; muff, needs struts. 
On a non-VW new car dealers lot. My mechanic said it 
would need a lot of work.  Dealer wants $5995 as-is.  

Book price is approx. $2100 retail, $1600 wholesale.  
But when I look at E-Page Internet Classified AD's
(http://ep_dot_com:80/h/epages.html) I see that the $6K is in the 
ballpark.  


Know that I would have to drop about $2500 to get it into 
reliable shape.  

What is it worth?  $2500 to $3000 ????
