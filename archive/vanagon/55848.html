From: Dave Mancuso &lt;Mancuso_at_etown.k12.pa_dot_us&gt;

&gt;I recently bought an 83 Westie ... but the key to the water tank is
&gt;missing. I tried the paper clip trick to open it, but it didn't work.
&gt;Does anyone know if this is a &quot;generic&quot; key or are they all keyed
&gt;differently? Is there any other way to open it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

You might be able to buy the key from VW (they're all the same).
Or it might be just as cheap to buy the whole tank cover with keys (you 
get two) from EuroAmerican RV (is Pete still there?), formerly Delta Six.
That's what I did, between 10-20 bucks as I recall. It was worth it.

Unfortunately, I don't have their number handy. Anyone else out there 
have it?
