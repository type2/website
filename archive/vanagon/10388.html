&gt; &gt; bentley sez:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; for air-cooled vanagon engines:
&gt; &gt;  nominal ........... 85-131 psi
&gt; &gt;  minimum ........... 73 psi
&gt; &gt;  max diff .......... 44 psi between any two cylinders
&gt; These figures do not seem to be supported by fact. The engine I have has a
&gt; compression ratio of 145 psi(air-cooled). The engine that I junked had
&gt; cylinders with a compression ratio of 90, 110, 120 and 110 and ran poorly.
&gt; A difference of 44 psi seems far too great, usually 10 % is the norm...DC

My '78 ran for years with compression in the range 90-115, and ran 
reasonably well. Three years ago it started getting worse (at about 
110kmiles) and cylinder two dropped to ~75psi. It still ran ok, but I 
had trouble passing emissions (high hydrocarbons). Then last year (at 
125kmiles) it dropped to ~50psi; still ran reasonably, but there was 
no way to pass emissions. So, I retired it to chicken coop status
until I can yank and rebuild. Anyway, it was leaking a lot of oil 
from the oil cooler.
