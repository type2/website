&gt; ok, martha...do you remember &quot;Monster Mash&quot;...when it first
&gt; came out?  If so that would make you a chronologically-
&gt; challenged-gyno-american!... Quick question...is
&gt; a gyno-american the same as a vagino-american?

NO! they are an all but wiped out tribal group in the interior of Brazil! &gt; 


BTW what does a &quot;person of mass&quot; mean? Is this someone over 150 pounds?

Is it similar to &quot;ugly bags of mostly water&quot;?

Also the reference to gyno-americans is not politically correct since it
excludes those persons of mass of either gender to the north of you on this
list, namely the &quot;warm weather beyond 100 days-challenged&quot;.
