OK, somebody check my logic:

My '70 camper only goes so fast, right?


A newish (let's say...  1990) brick goes a good bit faster, right?


Does it matter how fast you drive on the way to the bank to get the withdrawal
(oh, and a withdrawal of extraordinary magintude, I'm sure) needed to keep
the 1990 running?


I'll just sit back in my nomex leisure suit patiently awaiting flames the likes
of which this net has rarely seen...    :)
