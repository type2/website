Subject: My wheel nuts are frozen!!!

My 86 Westy (85000km) finnaly succumbed to it's very first flat tire (on the
rear where it gets all the heat). I thought this was going to be a piece of
cake to change...however after trying liquid wrench etc. I've only been able
to get one out of FIVE lugs undone. I've tried a cross bar wrench etc. and
no go. Does anyone have a suggestion...?
