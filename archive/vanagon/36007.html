&gt;&gt; And the &quot;drop test&quot; goes like this: &lt;flup&gt;
&gt;&gt; Looser than a five-dollar...

&gt;I have one comment.  I believe you said you used oil when you assembled
&gt;the rods on the crank.  If you use oil, the rods are gonna fall faster,
&gt;cause oil is relatively thin.  I would suggest trying this again but this
&gt;time use assembly lube instead of oil.

They fell even faster using the assembly lube! It surprised me, too.
