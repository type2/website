Well now that winter is coming to the northeast, Albany-NY, I am getting   
ready to look over my babie so that I don't get stuck on my way down to   
NYC on party weekends.

1-Towards the end of last winter, after running low on coolant, the VW   
dealer in my area did a compression test which confirmed a head gasket   
leak.  The warmer weather came and the leak stopped ( well at least the   
two ounces of green stuff on the ground every cold morning).  I have   
since put on the van about 8K miles and its working fine.  However, the   
leaks have come back with the same frequency as before.  Anything I   
should look out for?

2- Last night I was driving back from my girlfriend's place when I   
noticed that the lights on the dash were getting dimmer and brighter from   
time to time.  It seemed like it flickered from dim to bright every time   
I went over rough pavement.  Am I looking at a new alternator or just   
making sure the cabling ends are touching properly?

3-   and BTW I got brand new tires all around.  Goodyear Interceptor   
215/70/14 with that water channel.  Not one of those super ply tires but   
nevertheless a pretty good tire.  My vehicle seems to be a little slower   
at pick up (or maybe I am not used to driving on good tires) but the   
handling improved significantly.  My babie travels on the highway pretty   
smooth and under wind I don't sway as much, nor do I feel like I am going   
to tip over when making turns.  I went to Goodyear because Sears refused   
to sell me any tires not recommended by VW, you know, the bike   
tires-185/70/14. Paid about $62/each

Thanks,
