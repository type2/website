John -
Sounds like a nifty solution.  If you find a source for a inexpensive 
fluorescent lamp let me know. 
Time to rant a bit . . . How come you can buy a small 
fluorescent lamp for 120V for $9US, 
but have to pay $35 for an RV one of the same size?
 . . . end of rant.
High $ is reason why I haven't some something similar.

'80 Westi
'67 Sqbk bird perch

&gt; I'm well aware of sensitivities about ugly artless bad Westie 
&gt; modifications.  I've recoiled at some I've seen, but not all.  One I'm 
&gt; considering making seems in the spirit, character, and like the efficient 
&gt; utility that propelled its original design.  My '83 Westie has the 
&gt; overhead rear storage unit just behind the rear seat where I recently 
&gt; tried to read at night.
&gt;   The illumination was poor.  The original light over the kitchen is 
&gt; incandesent, so it produces about 80% heat and 20% light.  Its location 
&gt; produces text glare for rear seat occupants and is in their field of 
&gt; view, two lighting errors for reading/eating use.
&gt;   I think a long thin flouresent lamp and switch mounted on each side of 
&gt; the overhead storage cabinet's door handle would be nice yet minimally 
&gt; intrusive.  The electronic balast(s) would be mounter on the door's back 
&gt; side.  The following are all enabled by this installation: recomended 
&gt; over-the-shoulder reading/dining light source, high efficiency (typically 
&gt; 80% light), a variety of potential color temperature lamps, and second 
&gt; position utility.  By placing the lamps high on the door's front surface, 
&gt; when the door is swung down to open, they'd also illuminate the engine 
&gt; compartment, bed reading, and the space hehind the rear hatch.
&gt;   The only item I haven't located yet is a source for tidy front bulb 
&gt; covers.  Does anyone know of a source?  Also, how's this sound?
