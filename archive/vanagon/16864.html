&gt;I didn't know it was an option for N.A. Vanagons. I'm just going by the
&gt;Bildeskatalog (sp) for 80-85 European Vanagons that shows a different
&gt;resevoir for the option on Carat models. It has two pumps on it.

aye, there's the rub: only available on NA buses. :(  what we need is a
euro-junkyard over here!! which brings up a thought: do they have junkyards
in germany? i mean, what with the TUV and all, can you take parts off
wrecked cars and use them??
