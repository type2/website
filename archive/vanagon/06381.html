	Last night I got all but a couple of thin little areas of bondo off the
front of the bus!  Man, what a job!  

	I have an interesting theory about how this bondo job came to be:  

	Bus was hit.  Bus goes to body shop.  Body guy hammers out dents as best 
he can and turns it over to some guy to fill.  Filler dude doesn't know
what the front _end_ used to look like.  He ends up filling in all of the sexy 
little curves around the headlights and almost the entire &quot;V&quot; 'cause he
thinks its all s'posedto be FLAT!

	So, now that I had the bondo off, I popped out the larger dents from the
inside with my hand and a hammer (no, not in conjunction with each other!)
so now all thats' left is pick/hammer and dolly a lot of little bumps to
get it all flat again, and then fill, although much more conservatively this
time!
