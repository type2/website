Subject: Eye doctor and Navigating the Westy

I went to the optometrist this AM for the usual tune up. After deciding
which was clearer 1 or 2, 3 or 4 etc. The doctor said lean the chin here for
the glaucoma thing. OK. Poof..., Poof. Now tilt your head back and look up.
Uh, OK only because you're the doctor... Blink, blink. DOH~! Not the dreaded
dialation thing!! Soon I was too blurry to see the invoice, the style of
frames, and was concerned about driving the Vanagon back to work. The ol'
doc said not to worry as close up vision would be impaired but distance
vision would be Okay Dokay. ~Right~! Just perfect for driving back to the
office and doing more tedious computer work. Dummy me I believed him. 
Getting back to the office was *some* fun.  I felt like I had been at a
great Polish wedding or something! PHEW~!, Scuze me while I kiss the sky!
Dunt-dunt-da, Dunt-dunt-da!  (Cee colan-back slash my foot!) Funny, I didn't
G.A.S. about the rattling of the front end or the lack of power. I was just
happy to see the road. I suspect that this is a trick not to be repeated in
Vanagonia or through school zones!
