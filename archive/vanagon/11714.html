Subject: '96 Eurovan rumours

Howdy,

I haven't posted much, but I plan on buying a Camper sometime over the next
year.  After following the incredible flow of this group for a while, I'm
getting the happy feeling that I'm going to buy a lifestyle more than a car.

I called today to give Volkswagon my wishes for the new Eurovan.  The woman
who answered told me that the '96 model should have a 6-cylinder engine and
airbags.
Cool.

She also told me that I was the second person to have called her today
asking for a Camper color other than white :-).  (Personally, I want the
very-trendy and beautiful forest green.)

Thought someone may be interested.
Ron
