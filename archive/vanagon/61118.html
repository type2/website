Subject: EV Malfunction Woes

Somehow I guess I should be pulling back into a corner and sulking about
this nightmare surrounding me. I guess I have a need to publicly punish
myself and the &quot;NET&quot; and this LIST is a good place to do that!

No, actually I believe other EV owners/operators need to know what's
happening to us and could happen to them.

It would seem VW of America is profiting from the expectation that we
don't talk to each other so they can shaft us one-by-one.

The dealer has the Eurovan. 'Other stuff' is being found to have
malfunctioned that was, either, &quot;the cause&quot; of the original malfunction
or &quot;was a subsequent effect&quot; of the original malfunction.

Something called an Idler Arm (or whatever - sounds like that) failed
and caused the compressor bearings to go out (and on, and on, and on).
When the compressor failed, other stuff was broken in the sequence.

PARTS, Parts, parts, even the VW dealers don't have some of the parts
now required. This dealer is serching the 'after-market' for parts.

I have received information like, &quot;don't worry, we'll try to keep the
cost down as much as possible.&quot; But the estimate to put this vehicle
back on the street is now above $1,500.

You gotta' love this to stay in the game!!!! ;-(
