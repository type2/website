Subject: GUN (NON)CONTROL + VW ?????



(and I thought I'd be last person to ask to limit contents of
postings......)

Would it not be more appropriate to discuss these at the mailing
lists:

hyperbole_at_presidential.politics_dot_gov

or

soundbites_at_solutionsRus.smart.folks  

?????


Now, if the topic of discussion is mounting a (preferably laser) gun
turret on top of the westy -- well, you've got my 12-year-old's
attention, at least :-)

 &gt; Sounds to me more like Texas will probably end up being a more &quot;polite&quot; 
 &gt; society if more people get the message that being a bozo burglar could 
 &gt; cost you more than just a slap on the wrist from the justice system.
