Subject: 87 Syncro oil/coolant leak

Hello list,
     
      Fairly new list member here and the proud new owner of an 87 Syncro GL
with 98,803 miles. [5spd, Blue ext., Grey/blue int., no rust, no dents,
really clean engine, rebuilt trans and steering column, new tires, great
cond, paid $6,000]   My van has been sitting in the driveway for a little
over a month due to registration problems (every week I started it up for an
hour and drove it around the block).  Yesterday I started it up and
immediately noticed a oil leak directly under the oil filter.  I then saw
that there was a little bit of coolant dripping down as well (about 1 drip
for every 10 of oil).  [A little background; The person who sold it to me
drove it up from Florida to here in CT late December.  I had it checked out
by a VW dealer before buying.  They found nothing wrong with it (pressure
test....) and said it was in great cond.  Though now there is an oil/coolant
leak and the car has only been driven 3 miles since VW did the evaluation.]
 A friend said that the leak is probably coming from the oil cooler (which
would explain there being both oil and coolant) and it is most likely in need
of tightening or a seal replacement.  This is due to the dramatic change in
weather (From warm Florida to freezing CT) causing the seal to crack (which
would explain why this is happening when I haven't even really driven the
car).  Any input would be most helpful.  I would love to fix this (possible
minor problem) myself but I am new at this and do not yet have the knowledge
or a repair manual.  The VW dealer said that it will cost me $108 minimum
with out parts. (could be more ouch!)

Thanks,
Chris Wright
