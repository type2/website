                    The KC Run - Day One

I planned an early departure but a balky clothes dryer held me
captive while it huffed and puffed and blew the clothes dry.  In
the meantime the cool morning fog seeped into the trees leaving
behind a scent of early California morning with a hint of heat to
come.

I left the house at 10:30, the bus loggy and slow with its load
of fuel and engines and tools and bagles.  I piloted her gently
down the north-bound on-ramp of I-15 at 10:50 and set out for
Kansas City.

Approaching Murrieta I encountered the I-215 by-pass and took
it.  This was not my planned route.  I hadn't thought of using
the 215 until I saw the sign.  It's a few miles shorter than
riding I-15 thru Corona.  I suppose I was trying to make up the
time lost.  And the bus was s-l-o-w.  A few miles from the house
I had to use 3rd to get over the crest of the Rainbow grade and
more time was lost at the illegal-alien check-point, where the SS
peered in my windows wondering why a bus with no passengers
should be so heavily laden.  The guy's eyes riveted on a box of
.38 caliber ammunition that happened to be in plain view and it
was several minutes before I could convince the young man to go
back to annoying tourists and let me get on to Kansas City.

An hour north of the house, although barely forty miles on my
way, the left rear tire blew with an explosive Pop! throwing the
bus toward the shoulder.  There was a kerb-like berm just there
and we hit it with enough force to snap the steering wheel out of
my hands as the old bus caught a little air.

The new saddle tanks with their 30 gallons of gasoline reduce my
mid-frame ground clearance to less than nine inches.  When I went
airborne I thought the trip was over, that the next sound I heard
would be the sizzle of barbecue sauce being applied to my ass. 
But the old bus flew over the berm, the fuel tanks untouched.  We
landed in the grass and ground to a stop amidst a cloud of dust,
my wrists tingling, hands numb.  I jumped out and inspected the
tanks but they were undamaged.  Not so the steering but I
wouldn't discover that for a couple of days.

The tire should not have blown.  Although the bus is heavily
laden, it's weight is within the load-range of the tires.  But
they are passenger-car tires, house-branded crap ('Reliant') from
Discount Tire Company, a chain-store outfit here in Southern
California.

I dug out the jack and changed the tire.  Having blown one I took
the trouble to inspect the others and found a bulge in the flank
of the other rear wheel.  Crap. Unreliant.  Are you listening,
Discount Tire Company?

I was just past Sun City, a place old people come to die.  I
suppose they sell tires there but it was high noon on a hot
Sunday in June and Sun City was closed.  My spare was an old
truck tire, my other spare a P185, thrown in for insurance.  With
hundreds of miles of desert to cross, the trip would have to be
pushed back another day. 

The next town up the pike was Perris.  I swung across the highway
there, planning to come home.  But just as you come off the
freeway you can see 'Henry's Tire Shop', a used tired joint.  I
pulled in and was immediately surrounded by neatly uniformed
attendents.  Starched white shirts.  At a tire shop?  A USED tire
shop?

Enrique had a pair of light truck tires with some tread still
showing. He skinned them onto my rims, tossed the Discount Tires
tires into the trash, including the unblown, one with a causul
'Eees no good.'  Eighteen minutes and thirty-two bucks later I'm
back on I-215, heading for Kansas City.

Wheeled past Norton Air Force Base, home of many a tall tail and
an interesting museum containing some of the planes I've flown. 
And some I've shot down.  I was making good time.  I tried to
convert 60 miles per hour, standard atmosphere and temperature,
into Mach number but the highway dumped me into the mixmaster of
the five-level interchange at Colton before I could work it out.

The used tires gave the bus a better feel, although the steering
seemed a bit light.  All the way up Cajon Summit I wondered what
it was that made me take 215 instead of going straight-on thru
Corona, which has no Enriques in starched white shirts working
hard on a Sunday in pursuit of the American Dream.

The high desert was burning, a plume of dirty grey smoke
blowing down the wind.  It was over a hundred degrees in
Victorville but cooler when I ran under the moil of smoke.  The
bus was running sweetly, averaging better than fifty miles per
hour.  Every few minutes I transferred a little fuel from the
saddle tanks to the main, the transfer accomplished by leaning
forward and thumbing a round black button, turning on an electric
fuel pump capable of delivering thirty gallons per hour.  I would
come to hate that button but it seemed like a good idea at the
time.  It is installed just below a square red button that
activates the windshield washer, a device of doubtful worth since
I have no windshield wipers, they having gone astray with an
undelivered order from J.C.Whitney. 
    
The deeper into the desert I drove, the hotter it became.  One
hundred and eight at Barstow where I peeled away from Las Vegas-
bound I-15 to pick up I-40, celebrated with a mileage marker
telling me it was only 2,554 miles to someplace on the east coast
where I-40 rolled into the Atlantic.  I was more interested in
the steadily rising temperature.  It was one-ten at Daggett and a
withering one-fourteen by the time I reached Newberry Springs.  

I was wearing my desert towel which happens to be a real towel
although any handy rag will do.  You keep it soaked with
water and use it to wipe your face and neck.  Heading east, the
sun was on the passenger-side of the bus and I was reasonably
comfortable, wearing boots and khakis.  Stripping down to keep
cool during hot weather is something of a myth.  Your bare
skin is liable to absorb more heat. 

The bus didn't notice the heat.  Climbing the Cajon grade the oil
temp rose to 220 and I'd turned on the blower mounted on the
auxiliary oil cooler, knocking the temperature down to 180.  The
fan was still on, the oil temp about 200 in the 114 degree heat. 
Oil pressure was firmly pegged at 50 psi, engine steady at 3,500
rpm, speed about 55 mph.  Things were going good.

Beyond Newberry I encountered a type of sign fairly common in the
western United States but virtually unknown to easterners.  &quot;NEXT
SERVICES 108 MILES.&quot;  At that point the mileage and the
temperature were almost exactly the same.

Halfway across the blank area on the map I crested a small rise
and saw a brown 1982 Volkswagen bus on the shoulder with the
deck-lid up and someone working on the engine.  When I pulled
over and stopped the owner looked surprised, either at my
stopping or at another VW bus -- his was the first I'd seen all
day.

The fellow's name was Rich Fuller and he'd fried his engine and
was in the process of frying himself, although he didn't know it. 
No air-seals on his plugs or oil pressure switch and several
holes allowing heated air from under the vehicle to be forced
into the engine compartment.  The oil was black and burnt.  The
engine had gotten so hot some plastic parts in the engine
compartment were melted.

It was about 3:00 P.M.  Because of the tire and the dryer and
going slow in the heat I had only made good about 200 miles and
was counting on the long desert run to build back my average. 
But Rich is a nomad, the Westy is his home.  He could not
abandon it and even if he did, there was no help nearer than
fifty miles no matter which way he headed.  No one else had
stopped and he'd been there quite a while.

His engine would still turn over so there was a chance he hadn't
wiped the bearings, meaning we could probably get her running. 
But she wouldn't last long without air seals.  I began sitting up
camp on the side of the road.

Rich seemed surprised when I sat him down, made him drink some
orange juice then began pouring water into him.  He was working
without a shirt and the temperature was above a hundred and ten. 
He hadn't eaten in quite a while and while he didn't realize it,
he was seriously dehydrated and surprised himself by downing
nearly a quart of water before he felt full.  In the desert, the
best place to carry water is in your belly.

Rich and I worked on his Volkswagen for about about four hours,
fabricating seals and replacing his burned oil.  He was running
10W-40, not recommended for high-speed desert driving with an
air-cooled engine.  I dosed him up with thirty weight, using half
my hoard.

Despite our efforts the engine would not run.  It had spark and
air and fuel, and it seemed to be trying to fire, but it wouldn't
catch.  The problem appeared valve-related.  I suspected burnt
valves but Rich thought it might be a rocker-arm stud problem
unique to that engine, which he'd overhauled himself and fairly
recently too.  Then again, it was a fuel injected engine and I
don't know beans about FI systems.  We muddled and tested and
tried everything we could think of, which was mostly cold beer
for me and Slurpies for Rich.  You get like that after a while in
the desert.  In the end, we lost our daylight and were left with
only one option.

I use a main sheet for a tow cable.  To non-sailors that's a
big braided nylon rope.  I lashed a bridle around my bumper,
hooked it to the Westy and took the fifty-two hundred pound
vehicle under tow.  It was about 8:00 P.M., the temperature mebbe
a hundred, probably more.  We were pointing east and for that
reason alone continued in that direction.  Needles was about
sixty miles away, on the other side of the 2,770 foot summit of
South Pass.

A stock-engined 1965 VW Microbus bus was never meant to tow a
five thousand pound Westy.  On the other hand, anything can tow
anything else if you can get it moving, the only problems are how
fast you can go and how long before your engine explodes.

Once we got our signals straightend out -- brake off AND out of
gear -- the Greenbuss took up the slack and we went creeping up
the grade.  In the heat.

Rich had the tougher job and did it superbly.  Rich was my
brakes.  Using a Westy as the brakes kinda redesigned my bumper
and didn't do my steering any good but it got us down the grades
and some of them were steep.  If Rich gets access to the net
perhaps he can provide more insight into what it means to be
towed by an old bus.  For me, it was just plain hard work.  The
five thousand pound trailer pretty much went wherever it wished,
leaving me to crank the steering wheel in despiration.  Each time
Rich trod the brakes the lurching jerk snapped the wheel to
straight-ahead-centered no matter where it was pointing the
instant before.  It also shifted my load in several unusual
directions.  But we were leaving the desert and the friendless
highway behind.  All else was detail. 

We came down the grade into Needles about midnight, some thirteen
hours after leaving home.  The temperature was 100 degrees.  It
felt cool.  The sixty mile tow was no fun-run but Rich and his
home were safely out of the desert.

The engine-hour meter in Greenbuss said I used the engine 7.6
hours since pulling onto the freeway that morning.  In that time
I made good only 277 of the more than 1,500 miles of my journey
to Kansas City, my average speed a blistering 36 miles per hour. 
Despite the slow speed I'd burned nearly thirty gallons of fuel,
running the engine at 3,500 rpm in 2nd and 3rd for the duration
of the tow.  The tow left my clutch feeling sorta slippy and my
steering loose as a goose from all the jerking around.  

I decided I'd better tell Bob Polys his engine would arrive a day
later than planned.  Or mebbe a week.  A week would be good.  I
jacked into a motel phone and discovered my laptop had eaten the
hard drive.  I called home and brought them up to date and my
wife sent Bob Polys a message putting him in the know.
