Subject:      Re: Timing Notch? on 2.1 Digifant

Good Question -  Bentley can be confusing because the photos show both the 1.9
and 2.1; and the 1.9 timing mark is AFTER TDC while the 2.1 is BTDC.

The V shaped mark is the 5 deg BTDC mark that per &quot;spec&quot; should line up with
the case seam. The rounded notch is TDC reference. Having tried timing to spec
and slight variations I agree about 8 deg BTDC works better, giving more power
and smoother acceleration. (Both my vans came timed closer to this than to 5
deg. per the pulley.) 8 deg will put the V notch slightly to the LEFT of the
case seam.

I suspect the flywheel TDC sensor used by VW is more accurate than the pulley
notch. Since VW uses the sensor they may not be as careful with the notch
placement.

Be sure to fully warm the engine, then after starting unplug the &quot;temp II&quot;
sensor on the left side of the thermostat housing (while running) before
checking timing.

HINT: This is hard to unplug with the engine running and hot since as it's
awkward to press in the locking clip. So I unplug first when cold and
carefully remove the locking clip, then replace and warm the engine. Then it
unplugs with just a pull while running. Be sure to put the clip back on and
plug in when you are through. If you are a Texas Aggie, tape the clip to your
forehead when you take it off. If you forget it someone else may notice. Be
sure to watch for other Aggie Vanagon owners.

I have some confusion regarding the timing notches on the flywheel:
-------------^---------F
-----u-----------------R
When setting the timing (Temp Sender II disconnected, revs at 2000 rpm)
which notch gives the required 5 degree ahead of TDC? In other words
which notch is which if either?
