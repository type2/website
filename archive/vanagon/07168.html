Subject: Vacuumn advance problem - update

     Hi all,
     
     Let me just remind you about my problem, I wasn't getting any vacuum 
     at the carb vacuum iutlet to advance the ignition timing. So my bus 
     would barely reach 50mph.
     
     Last weekend I fitted a Bosch 009 centrifugal advance distributer that 
     I picked up for 20 quid (brand new). I also overhauled the carburettor 
     with a carb. repair kit ie new gaskets etc.
     
     As a result the bus goes 60+ mph no problems and really pulls well in 
     all the gears.
     
     So although I never quite worked out why there was no vacuum at the 
     carb. vacuum outlet, the bus now runs really well with its' 009.
     
     cya,
     
     Lee.
