Subject: RE: Looking for FI&amp;heater motor for 77 bus

Lots of great info on FI I see.. both pro and con...

&gt;I live in PA around 40 min from philly, are you anywhere near here or would
&gt;the system have to be shipped?
&gt;What's a reasonable price?  I went to buy a system at the junk yard here and
&gt;he wanted $200.  I didn't think that was reasonable.  Let me know what you
&gt;think is fair.

I was hoping I'd be able to strip the FI from a parts bus locally for maybe $100 or so. Unfortunately, I live in Calgary, Alberta (in Canada, eh), and the selection here is grim. I'm planning a tour of the local wrecking yards this w/e, and I'll see what turns up.

and Jon Hathaway quotes...
&gt;If you're anywhere in NE, I'ld be more than happy to give you a box or =
&gt;two of Bus F/I stuff I've had hanging around... If you live much farther away, it wouldn't be &gt;very cost effective to send it to ya... It weighs a ton...

WOW!!! talk about community spirit!!! I can only hope I'm able to collect bits and pieces over the years so I can help out a newbie (or newbus??). Thanks Jon.

If the local parts market falls through, I may have to take you up on your offer(s) and have the parts shipped. Hopefully I can find something here, but I may need some specific parts. I'll get back to Jon and Martin privately after this w/e.

I have checked a few local VW parts sources (not VW dealers) - parts are scarce and prices high :(


Dave.
