Subject: Some 1600cc questions.

 
 Having pulled the dead 2 litre from my bus a few weeks ago I'm
 left with the dilema of rebuilding the 2 litre (which is what
 I really want), or slapping in a 1600 (which is all I can really
 afford). 
 
 I have a number of partially complete 1600s lying around, and
 so would really only require bearings, gasket set and rings to
 get a reasonable motor. That lot cost less than the gasket set
 alone for the 2 litre. 

 I pulled apart an AS21 based engine yesterday and the case, pistons 
 and bores are in excellent condition, but the whole thing has been 
 running really rich. The layer of carbon on the pistons and head 
 is amazingly thick! 

 I noticed as well that the oil deflector plate has been installed
 the wrong way round, probably not a problem but more a comment on the
 care (!?) that the previous builder put the engine together with.

 Which leads to some questions. This engine has a 050 dizzy fitted.
 Now Muir says this is a no no for this engine, as it dosn't retard
 #3. Has anyone run a 1600 with a 050? Any problems?

 I would have to use the alternator from the 2 litre with the 1600.
 I pressume that as the later 1600s had alternators, that they
 were of the same type for both engines?

 Having changed the engine mounting arrangement to suit the type 4
 style (i.e.) solid mountings on the chassis, rubber mounting on the
 engine, I now find the mounting bar for the 1600 is the other way round
 (rubber on the chassis mounts, bolts on the engine). I'm unwilling to hack
 the mountings around again, so is there a quick and easy solution to this?  

 (The more questions I come up with the more I start to realise I'd
  better re-mortgage the cat and go the 2 litre route, but anyway any
  answers would be appreciated)  

 TIA
 cheers
