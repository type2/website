&gt; cars in MD, and wrote me a work order to install them in 30 days or my tags will 
&gt; suspended. I told him that I thought that the DOT did not require them until 
&gt; '68, but to no avail.

Well, I don't know about MD law, but I do know about my cars.  My '63 
Dodge has none.  My '65 Chevy has only two seat belts, but can seat six.  
And my '66 Kombi only had 2 front belts, and one front seat, I added 
anther front seat, and a rear bench including seat belts.

As far as I know with CA law, if the car didn't come with it, you are not 
reqired to have it.  But if you added seat belts then they must be worn 
when applicable.
