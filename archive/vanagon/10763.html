I tried to send this last night, but I don't think it went;

The Fuel Injection Blues - make up your own tune, this prolly would
work well with a harmonica.  Enjoy!

My baby didn't start this mornin'
I didn't know what to do -
I turned the key an nuthin' happened 
so I had to drive my shoes

I checked the damn fuel pressure,
n' the regulator tooo
I know I'm gonna be late for work now 
and I don't know what to doo

Oh I got the Fuel Injection bluuuuuuuues,
yeah I got the FI blues real baaaaad

I checked with old Mr St Muir
Clymer and Bently tooo
Nobody can tell me what the hell is goin on
or what i'm s'posed to dooo

Oh I got the Fuel Injection bluuuuuuuues,
yeah I got the FI blues real baaaaad

Now I replaced the fuel filter
and I don't use Texaco gas
I'm beginnin' to think this bosch crap
is a stone cold pain in the ass!

Oh I got the Fuel Injection bluuuuuuuues,
yeah I got the FI blues real baaaaad

I asked my local mechanic,
I asked my mistress Barb,
I think I'm gonna rip it all out -
gonna get me a brand new carb!

Oh I got the Fuel Injection bluuuuuuuues,
yeah I got the FI blues real baaaaad

One minute I had it started
and then it began to stall
yesterday it ran just fine
I don't understand it at all!

I think I'll get me a honda
or maybe a new gee-o
gonna get my hands on that bosch engineer
and I'll tell 'm where to go!

Oh I got the Fuel Injection bluuuuuuuues,
yeah I got the FI blues real baaaaad
