&gt;I am new to the list and think its great.  You guys really are crazy.
&gt;I thought I would tap in to your vast collective knowledge for some
&gt;advice.  I am considering purchasing a 1972 vw van.  It is sort of 
&gt;rusty because it was submerged in a pond for about 3 years.  The 
&gt;engine has been replaced with a TIII engine, but it has no compression 
&gt;on #3 and ranges from about 60-90 psi on the rest.  The automatic 
&gt;transmission slips if you go uphill so it probably needs to be rebuilt.
&gt;I want it to have air conditioning &amp; I found a guy who can put a 
&gt;Mercedes delivery truck a/c unit on the roof.  Do you think $3500 is 
&gt;too much for this van?  A friend says he thinks he can make it into 
&gt;a camper.
&gt;

This IS Friday I guess, so this MUST be a joke! Mustn't it? The price is 
really $35.00 right? If not, then I just gave away a valuable vehicle, a '72 
pop-top Westy with rebuilt 1700 T2 motor. It's been sitting in my driveway 
for 6 years, not a pond. I'd have let you have it for say $5,000/best. It's 
a bit rusty, 4 spd. transmission was fine, so was motor and brakes but they 
need some attention..........

Dump the other turkey now!
