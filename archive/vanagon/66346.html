Subject:      Syncro body height

Hi All.  I was checking out my Bentley this morning trying to find
the ride height specs for my van.  Well, I went through that manual
several times, and couldn't find it.

Anybody have these specs?  I believe the height is measured from the
centre of the wheel fender lip to the ground.  Anybody with a Syncro
Westy willing to measure their van for me?

This will determine if my springs are indeed sagging.

Thanks a lot!
Harry.
