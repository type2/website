Subject:      luggage rack

Dear Volks,

I'm getting VERY serious about buying my first Westfalia.  My wife,
daughter, and I enjoy camping, bicycling, sailing, and canoeing.  The
camping trade off is obvious in that we hope to do more travel/camping
and would use the Westy rather than the ole dome tent.  I'm sure I can
find a good bike rack to haul our three bikes.  I don't intend to tow
the sailboat BUT I have an 18.5 ft. kevlar canoe that I'd like to be
able to mount on top.  It only weighs 42 lbs. but the wind can really
&quot;rack&quot; the thing around if it gusts.  My concern is this:  Can the top
of the Westies handle this type of twisting?  If so, do the gas shocks
on the pop-top have enough oommph to hold the canoe up or would I need
to unload the canoe everynight (and chain it to the axle!)

P.S. my first post!
P.P.S.  Anybody know a great '85-'93 Westfalia for sale in the Midwest.
