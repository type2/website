Subject:      Wanted - Euro-spec headlights for a '91 (rectangular)

     Does anyone out there have a line on getting Euro-spec headlights for
     the late Vanagon?

     I don't want to go retro to round lights (always wanted a Vanagon with
     rectangulars).

     Do our Canadian friends suffer with the same S.A.E.-approved junk that
     we have?

     Anyone in Europe with access to a few good wrecking yards want to go
     into business?
