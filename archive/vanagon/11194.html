Subject: Re: strange noise scare

     &gt;I'm just about in panic stage right now, thinking my engine is about 
     &gt;to self destruct, and then I look back and upward thru the sunroof 
     &gt;and see the KC-135 overhead into Mc Lellan, and my heartrate starts 
     &gt;to return to normal, everyone starts laughing at me and I always fall 
     &gt;for that one...
     
     Like when your waiting at the lights and some dude pulls up next to 
     you, but you can't see him coz the mirrors are useless and you hear 
     this &quot;clack-clack-clack-clack etc.&quot; noise - you think shit I've run a 
     big end, then the lights change and the guy pulls past you in his 
     Diesel Peugeot!
