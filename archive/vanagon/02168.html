I wonder what I forgot....

You know the Olde Fart's slogan:

	Seen it,
	Done it,
	Remember some of it.

Someday I'll tell y'all how my '69 bus was partially responsible for a
regular character in Doonesbury.  Believe me; you'd never guess.  And
yes, I know I'm late to this discussion, but when you're working until
2100 every evening it's kinda hard to find time to keep up with this
firehose y'all are drinking from.  So sue me, but send it to the office;
I'm never home anymore.
