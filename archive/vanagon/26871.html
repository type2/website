Subject: Re: Emissions (CO) still out...

David, come up to Ramona some time and I will put one of your fancy hotrods
on one of my two infrared scopes one time and show you how wrong you are. Let
me lean out any of your engines and see if we get high CO.Are you willing to
risk burnt valves on your knowledge? Trust me I have performenced tuned
anything from a 500 SEC to 930 to 735 to vvette, jaguar xjs to a motorhome
and have built  many performance engines. HIGH CO is rich.Ed
