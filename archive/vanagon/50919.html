&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;         I called the &quot;VW dealer&quot; here in Traverse City, MI to check on the
&gt; cost of a rear heater core for my '86.
&gt;         When the parts guy got back to me he first apologized, I knew that
&gt; this was going to be bad news. Over $800!! We discussed the part, and we
&gt; agreed that that was what I wanted. It was NOT the whole box, just the
&gt; heater core.
&gt;         Wow.

ROB HAVE I GOT A DEAL FOR YOU.

Contact Tom Forhan at tforhan_at_pipeline_dot_com and get on &quot;The Deal: Propex
Group Purchase&quot; 

To quote Tom:
	&quot;Propex sells the Compact 1600 furnace for L250, and will give a
minimum
of five units 10% off, knocking the price to L225. Thats from US$382 to
US$344&quot;

THATS A LITTLE CHEAPER THAN $800.00 and it works when you're stopped.

Larry J. (We just need 3 more.)
