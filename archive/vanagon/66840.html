I've always understood that the engine should be off when you disconnect
the O2 sensor.  Since very little seems to be known about Bosch ECU's
inner workings, (at least, I know very little about their inner workings)
I have to answer in a practical fashion; it doesn't seem to matter on my
'81 van.  (The ECU on my '81 is so old, it probably doesn't HAVE any
writtable memory.)

I wouldn't think leaving the sensor connected would make much sense, as
it would be giving feedback to the ECU, and the ECU would try to hold the
mixture at &quot;ideal&quot; by varying the pulse width.  The Bently manual tells
you to disconnect the O2 sensor when setting idle mixture using your CO
sensor (I wish!!)

&gt; I realize I have asked a lot of questions, but I don't want to ruin
&gt; anything.  I have a digital meter, but it is very difficult to get a reading
&gt; because of the pulsing.  When the engine is running either rich, or lean,
&gt; the voltage reads steady.  As soon as I get out of the far reaches of the
&gt; scale the pulsing makes reading the voltage difficult.  Any suggestions
&gt; would be appreciated.

I think that's what you're supposed to see.  When I've set my idle
mixture with my DVM I never see a steady voltage around the proper
set-point.  I watch and adjust until the fluctuations hitting above and
below the right voltage seems about even.
