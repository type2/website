In regard to why certain years are popular, etc. all I have to say
is this...the &quot;cream&quot; ALWAYS rises to the top thats why there
are only a fortunate few of us who have been graced by the gods
at Wolfsburg with EuroVans...think of the little pictogram
as a bell curve, and you will find us EuroVan (and yep that includes
&lt;ahem&gt; PJ) out there in the 98th percentile!!

Full of myself once more,
Ric
