To All:

If you have a constant load that draws high amperage, such as half a dozen
100 watt halogen headlamps or a 12vdc 'fridge that can freeze a case of
Tecate before you get out of town, then you should be very kind to your
alternator, for it is frying.

A generator is only about 50% efficient at converting rotary motion into
electrical energy.  Alternators are more efficient, which is why they run
cooler, but they still generate a lot of waste heat.

The maximum output of an alternator or generator is always touted loudly in
the ads.  But the DUTY CYCLE is seldom mentioned at all.  If you're one of
those picky types who reads the fine print, you'll discover that the loudly
touted maximum rating is often only good for one minute out of ten (10% duty
cycle), and then only for some ridiculously low temperature, such as 59
degrees Fahrenheit.  So you run your finger down the column to see what
output you can count on for 100% of the time and....  ummm  '10A'.   60 Amp
alternator that's only good for 10 amps?  Can that be right?  Yup.  Except,
this is just a fer-instance; check your own alternator's specs.  Or, as a
rule of thumb, use one-fifth the maximum output as a safe continuous-output
level, that is, 12 amps in the hypothetical case here.  And down in the
ultra-fine print below the fine print there's usually a 'correction factor'
for temperatures higher than 59 degrees Fahrenheit.  

So you work it all out and discover that on a hot night in Baja you have
exactly enough juice to run one tail-light and a cheap CB radio set on
Receive-Only.  No headlights.  But they've thoughtfully included a white cane
with your alternator kit.  Alas, white canes are not too handy when you're
bounding through the boonies at a rate of knots.

So what happens when you turn on your six Flamethowers?  Eventually, they'll
live up to their name.

What to do?  Carrying a spare alternator is a good bet.  Something off a Ford
or GMC truck.  The bigger the better.   Make a bracket so you can run a
second belt off your pulley, leave the original alternator in place to drive
the blower.  Drive on!

So why aren't we eating alternators left and right?  The truth is, we are.
 The Mean Time Between Failure (MBTF) for a new Bosch alternator is something
like 5,000 hours.  In theory, you wouldn't wear the thing out until you'd
driven a quarter million miles.  But exceed the spec -- let it run a little
hot -- and it's life is shortened.  Exceed the spec by a whole bunch and it's
life is measured in tens of hours instead of thousands.

The other reason why your alternator holds up is the simple fact that nights
are cool.    Drop the ambient temp to forty Fahrenheit and your alternator
can pump out twice the normal continuous rating.  Drop the mercury down to
freezing and you can probably run an arc welder off your alternator without
causing a bit of trouble.  Heat kills.  So does air-conditioning.

Air conditioning places a heavy electrical demand on your alternator when the
outside air temp is at its hottest.  On an American cars equipped with
factory-installed air-conditioning, part of the package is to replace the
stock alternator with one having a higher rating.  Work the numbers out for
yourself.  You'll see that, at least according to the specs, the stock
alternator should do just fine... except it will be running close to max in
order to do so.  It is the fine print, the stuff the dealers don't like you
to read, that sez yer crazy unless you install a humungous alternator along
with your gas-guzzling air-conditioning system.

Is there no hope for the innocent?  No.  Well... maybe.  You can reduce your
air-conditioning load by about half if you -- or someone -- would only
insulate your vehicle better.  (I've got a post on that.  Somewhere.)  But
factories don't do it because the insulation would have to go in as part of
the basic body assembly, long before the chassis got far enough down the
assembly line to know if it was going to be blessed with air-conditioning.
 So they sell you an uninsulated tin can, then hang a huge air-conditioner on
it.  The other way is to sell you a well insulated tin can with an itty-bitty
air-conditoner that would keep you just as cool.  Of course, that would call
for a bit of pre-planning, which in Detroit means where to go for lunch.

My own favorite Wild Idea #237 is to install a one-cylinder auxiliary power
unit -- a little Honda 6cid engine with an automatic electric starter and all
the trick sh... stuff.  Use it to run a refrigeration system.  A REAL
refrigeration system.  A chest-type reefer (the ones with doors are a lame
idea inside a hot bus) AND an air-conditioning system.  Boats do it.  Custom
RVs do it.  Why can't we do it?  Another principle seen in other vehicles is
to power ALL accessories with 110vac (or 440vac in aircraft) and to use your
auxiliary power unit (APU in airplane-speak) to generate the required power.
 When you land, dock or park, you plug into shore power and everything
continues to work.  Some of the sceani-cruizer-size Luxury Tub RVs are
designed this way, picking a page out of executive aircraft manuals.  But the
concept appears alien to the typical VW van owner.  I don't know why; most of
the components to assemble and install such a system are available as
of-the-shelf items.  All it takes is money.

The trend in automotive designs is toward greater complexity.  The down-side
is that unless the owner is a rocket scientist about all they can do is steer
the thing and pay the bills.  Big bills, too.  Adding additional electrical
loads to the existing automotive electrical system not only increases its
complexity, it can shorten the life of the alternator or generator.  The same
holds true when we task our engine with powering both the vehicle and a
refrigeration system.  The truth of this is self-evident just by opening the
hood of any modern car; Tarzan himself couldn't survive in that python's nest
of hoses, let alone the typical mechanic.  Nowadays, keeping your car alive
and well is liable to require the services of a whole squad of specialists.  

Our older vehicles have survived -- and will continue to roll -- primarily
because of their simplicity.  Each time we ask more of them, we take a step
away from that broad and simple path.  Read the fine print.  It's a jungle
out there, folks.

ps -- You'll notice I've made no mention of propane-powered absorbtion-type
refrigeration units,  just as Volkswagen (and others) have been careful not
to make any mention of absorbtion-type units that use waste heat from the
exhaust system.  (Cheap, efficient and effective... so long as the engine is
running.)

 Tri-powered absorbtion-type refrigeration units exchange efficiency for
convenience.  If you want your typical VW reefer to work like a champ,
dismantle it, convert it to a chest instead of a closet, and insulate the
hell out of it INCLUDING THE DOOR.  Providing better airflow over the
condenser coil -- using evaporative techniques if needed -- can turn the
typical camper 'fridge into freezer chest.
