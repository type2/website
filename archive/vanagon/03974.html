Subject: '91 Injector Recall
Date: Tue, 13 Sep 94 13:13:18 PDT



	Any '91 owners,

	For several months I've had hassles with my '91 Camper (Ruby) stalling
	with no restart until cool-down.

	To make a long frustrating story short, the local VW dealer played with
	the O2, changed plugs, added a ground wire to the airbox.....

	Still stalled....

	I got hip to the Injector recall via this distlist (Thanks, Joel!). I
	quizzed the dealer on it, they said yes, Ruby did qualify (I was never
	informed by VW). They did the retrofit. Ruby stalls no more.

	BTW, the parts kit is listed as $431 (cost me zero). It involves new in-
	jectors, hoses, everything from where the gas line enters the engine
	compartment to the combustion chamber is replaced.

	Don't miss out!

	Also, BTW, Ruby is for sale. I'll send details tomorrow. Gotta go...
