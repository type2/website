&gt; &gt;  &gt; I have solved my problem about what kind of antifreeze to use in my '84
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Vanagon.  I found out that Prestone makes a long life PHOSPHATE FREE
&gt; &gt;  &gt; antifreeze (about $6.50 locally).  That way, I can use a brand that I
&gt; &gt;  &gt; trust and a phosphate free antifreeze.

&gt; &gt;  Yes, but if that coolant ever comes into contact with any other brand,
&gt; &gt;  it will turn to jelly. Meaning if you bust a hose in West Texas and yoiu
&gt; &gt;  can't find that particular brand, you will have to drain the system and
&gt; &gt;  install whatever is available.

&gt; I've never heard that claim before.  What evidence supports this claim?
&gt; Even if true, one could just add water (temporarily) unless the temperatures
&gt; were really extreme.

Jim,
True, you can just add water, but think of the corrosion sizzling on the
old Vanagon's notoriously corrosion-prone heads as you are motoring
along without the corrosion inhibitor package. If you read the bottle on
the Prestone long-life Phosphate Free coolant, it reads that it cannot
mix with ethylene glycol or anything other than itself. In fact,
Prestone has colored it orange to remind users it cannot mix with
anybody elees green or pink coolant.
