Subject: Paint/Interior Codes (was M-Codes)

&gt;From: &quot;David Easterwood&quot; &lt;deasterw_at_ST6000.SCT.EDU&gt;
&gt;To: Multiple recipients of list &lt;vanagon_at_LENTI.MED.UMN.EDU&gt;
&gt;Subject: Paint/Interior Codes (was M-Codes)

&gt;Jim Bryant wants to keep the interest online (although he,
&gt;Michael Heron &amp; I seem to be the only ones interested)!

You, Michael and I are the only ones interested now, but
those breadloaf owners may benefit from this as well.  And
the Vanagon owners will (20 years from now) wonder what
that faded tag inside the driver's door really meant.  VW
gave us a fine stamped metal plate for us, as future
generations, to appreciate and decipher.

&gt;This is why I asked if anyone had a Velvet Green camper, to
&gt;see if it was the same for all Westys.

I understood the reason for your question, I hope by keeping
this in front of people we may find the Velvet Green key to
our mystery.  Maybe if we turned it into a video
game....find the Velvet Green Key to open the mystery door,
blah, blah, blah.  On further reflection, I take a new
tack...her Pearl White smile caught my eye before her Velvet
Green BIKINI, as she leaned on the roof of the Double Cab,
long legs atop her Ruby Red slippers perched on the BED with
fold-down gates of pleasure.

&gt;Color		L-code		Code on VIN plate

&gt;Grey				94

&gt;Full of useless information that
&gt;will never lead to financial gain,

&gt;Dave

Great little table, IMHO.  Financial gain?  Are we in this
for financial gain?  I thought we were in this because we
love doing it, and because among the list members there are
answers which may help other people who love it.  Actually,
it did lead to financial gain for VW but that was thirty
years ago.

P.S. Thanks for the M-Code list.
