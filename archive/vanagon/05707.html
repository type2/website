Subject: Re: Re- EuroVan Fog Light Switc


Norman mentioned a couple of options for fogs, especially the PIAA
90 PROs....not a bad idea!

One option I had thought of was to use the fog lights VW sold for
the Golf //s. These particular lights are made by Bosch. The unique
feature about them is that the adjustment is done by the rear of the
fog as opposed to the top on other fog lights.

On the back of the light unit is a half sphere with a bolt comming
out of the center. The bracket is a metal 90 degree bracket with
a cup to accept the back of the light unit. I figured I could
cut the bracket, mount the cup to the fog light cut-out on
the bumper, and then mount the fogs. 

I think I'll look into the PIAAs first. I'll be in touch.
