Subject:      larger tires under the fron

 SyncroBeast           larger tires under the front_
oops, almost forgot to respond on this one.  I've got Brigstone Dessert
Duelers A/T on '89 SyncroBeast.  Size 27 x 8.5.  The tire fits the spare area,
but like you say, it is a bit big.  I havn't noticed that it rubs the radiator
hose, but I am pressing marks in the sidewall from the wire bail over the top
of the tire.

I currently have the spare inside till I can figure out a good way to drop the
tray a bit or rebend the bail.  I don't like the wear on the tire.  I'm afraid
it will damage the sidewall.
