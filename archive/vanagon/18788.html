Subject:      Re: Cool Vanagon Trucks

p.s.
when i had some money and was actually trying to find one of these, i had
called ALL the dealers i could find along the canadian border, on both sides.
the ONLY trucks that had BOTH the EPA and DOT u.s. stickers were those in the
pacific northwest.

the trucks in Toronto, Windsor, Ottawa, and Montreal did NOT have the stickers
... and so, would have been much more hassle to bring over. even though it
would have saved me over a thousand miles one-way. :(
