Subject: Re: country decals

Thanks - it turns out I didn't get the right term for those things
earlier.  I know what you mean by the &quot;D&quot; ovals, but I think
what the thing I was talking about ends up being called a grill badge,
and has a picture of a country on it.  I'll check out the mag,
thanks!  :)
