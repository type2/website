Subject: Re: Need Eurovan Info, Piston Slap

It is a well known problem with VW of A.  Someone said that there is
an actual bulletin number for it.  It happened to our EV.  Apparently,
it has something to do with the Teflon coating on the pistons wearing
off or something (I do not know the details).  Our EV had 18,000 miles
when they replaced the engine, but I could hear the distinctive sound
as early as 10,000 miles or less.  Whatever the problem was, it has
not come back on this new engine -- we already put 15,000+ miles on
it.  The engine was replaced under warranty.

The sound is a giveaway:  Try to listen to the engine when it's
started on a cool day, and after it's been sitting for the night (go
to the dealer first thing in the morning).  When the engine starts up,
it'll sound like a diesel engine if it has the piston slap.

Goiod luck,
Cetin

 &gt; Regarding this &quot;piston slap&quot; problem in early Eurovans.  Do you know if
 &gt; this problem was noticeable in low mileage early Eurovans or does it
 &gt; develop after several thousand miles?  Was it a recall?  Was it covered
 &gt; under warranty?  What were dealer responses to it?  Is this the problem
 &gt; were they coated the pistons with teflon to fix it?  Was this a problem in
 &gt; Europe too?
