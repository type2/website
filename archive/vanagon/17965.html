Subject: '92 Westphalia - Safety Net

Can anyone help me locate a safety net for my '92 Westy, for use accross the 
opening to the upper bed, and used to prevent children from falling through 
the opening?  The VW Camper Supplementary Manual makes reference to this 
accessory however the dealers in B.C. here are unable to locate.

My 2 year old son tends to move through the night and I'd hate to see him 
drop through the hole.  

Thanks in advance.
