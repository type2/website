&gt;      The lateral movement you refer to is normal. The CVs are designed to
do that to allow the trailing arm to go through it's travel without trying
to pull the axle apart. If you take the CVs apart to grease them, and you
have a bad one, it will be obviously pitted or pounded out where the balls
run. If the grooves in the outer race and star (inner piece with splines)
are smooth  the CV is ok unless the cage is cracked.
