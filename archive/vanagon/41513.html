Subject: Help! Fridge won't start on propane...
Date: Tue, 07 May 96 10:51:00 EDT


... and I leave for vacation in two days.

OK, so this past weekend I learned how to use the fridge, stove, water tank 
etc. on my newly acquired '89 Westie.  I was able to get the fridge to start 
on propane ONCE (the light came on and it ran fine for a couple of hours 
until I shut it down), but for the past couple of days, I've not had any 
luck getting it to fire up.  Things I tried:

 - running the fridge on A/C: works great
 - filling up the propane tank: it took 35 cents worth
 - starting up the stove: works great
 - running the stove for a couple of minutes before attempting to start the
  fridge (the manual says you might want to do this to remove any air from
  the lines)
 - attempting to start the fridge while the stove is burning
 - patiently attempting numerous times the following:
     - setting 3-way switch to propane
     - turning on propane outside the van
     - turning rightmost dial to 12 o'clock (from 3 o'clock)
     - setting temp control to max
     - pumping leftmost switch 15-20 times (also tried 25-30 times)
     - holding safety button for 30 seconds while pushing in leftmost
       switch all the way

Am I forgetting something?  I'm starting to panic about this.
