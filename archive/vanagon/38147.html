Subject: 85 vanagon FS - VERY CHEAP!

 Greetings! 
   I just went to get my  85 GL inspected and due to exhaust leaks
 etc, it will be more than I'm willing to shell out. If you are 
 interested make a low offer [ you probable only have to beat a
 junkyard]. I can give you a ballpark figure if you are embarassed
 to go low enough.

            ,77,000 miles-the engine was rebuilt at 50,000 [heads were starting
 to pit then and we didnt replace them, so...] new heads 2 years ago,new
radiator 2 years ago, new power steering rack about 4 years ago new battery 2
years ago, good tires,...
 To make the van in top shape would require some exhaust work, quoted by a
dealer to
be 600$ so probably less at a reasonable shop, new front to back coolant lines
to

77,000 miles
 
   This van has a LOT of new parts on it. It's recent history includes
