&gt; How much would the shop charge?  The new guides are not expensive, but the
&gt; price of putting them in might be.  Assuming that there is no gross defect
&gt; with the original valve guides that had caused them to fail prematurely, by
&gt; the time your guides are worn the heads have had a long service life, say,
&gt; 50,000+ miles.  All air-cooled VW cylinder heads are prone to cracking
&gt; after experiencing thousands of heat cycles and need to be inspected and
&gt; welded, especially the Type I heads.  After 50,000+ miles, the exhaust
&gt; valves probably need to be replaced too.

I agree that the exhaust valves should be replaced - besides, they are
cheap at around $10 each.  The guides are also not very expensive, and I
believe they are simply pressed into the cylinder head - a task that any
shop should be able to accomplish, even if they have no VW experience.
As far as service life, 50,000 miles is nothing for cylinder heads.
Being aluminum, they don't fatigue and if they have no cracks, there is
no reason why rebuilt heads are better, and in fact, since you don't
know the history of the rebuilts, they could be a problem waiting to
happen.  This is the advice given in one of the rebuilding books I have.
I agree that type I heads are better candidates for replacement, because
they tend to crack more and are cheaper to buy rebuilt, but I haven't
seen very many cracked type IV heads. 

&gt; If the cylinder heads have been in use for a long time, they probably need
&gt; to be rebuilt if engine problems indicate a problem with the heads.  If you
&gt; can find a machinist that does good work, then GREAT!  Some parts of the
&gt; U.S., like So. California, have many such places.  Where I live, the
&gt; machinists look at you with a glazed-eye expression when you mention old VW
&gt; heads.  I find it better to trade in the old heads for a reconditioned set,
&gt; WITH a guarantee.

Good point.  I guess I am lucky that there is a guy down the street that
has a lot of experience with vw heads.  

[soapbox mode on]                        I don't have a lot of faith in
guarantees, though.  I don't know for sure, but I would bet that such a
guarantee would be for a max of one year, probably less.  Also, what if
they rebuild the heads with low quality exhaust valves, and one breaks
off and destroys the rest of the engine?  Does their guarantee cover
the replacement of the engine?  What about reimbursment for labor costs
of R&amp;R'ing the heads?  And for the inconvenience of having to be without
your bus while it is done?  I would much rather have my original heads
rebuilt with good quality parts by a reputable shop with no guarantee.

Wolf, maybe you could find a shop that you can ship your heads to, have
the work done, and have them shipped back?  I can help you find one in
San Diego if you are interested.  One of the best in town is Pauter
Machine, in Chula Vista.
