Subject: Wondering about Westfalia table heights.

My '85 came with one table. The height of the table was high enough to
fit either above the two top loading drawers next to rear seat or in the
front it could be slid partially above the stove leaving rear hatches 
accessible.

My '90 came with two tables. One the length of the '85 and one smaller.
Also the leg height of these tables are both shorter than the '85. The
main problem I see is that the larger '90 table must be stored in a way
that covers the rear hatches. Getting into these storage areas is less
convenient than before. Also, since I never travel with 4 people I don't
even need that smaller front table.

My questions are:

1. Has anybody else noticed this? Any suggestions for improving this
situation?

2. Where and how is that smaller table supposed to be stored for travel?
I see in the owners manual how it is set up for use but there is no
picture for where it belongs during travel..

Thanks in advance.
