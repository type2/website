Subject: V'gon Vent Cable Fix

During my brake work I saw a past repair that didn't work, so came up 
with a better one.

The cable sheath on the upper heater control lever (front air vent) 
broke and forces LOTS of travel to be able to open/close vent.

The same exact break is in my parts bus, in the same place.  Design 
flaw in my estimation.

I took a piece of 3&quot; long Tigon tubing, with an internal diameter slightly 
smaller that the outside diameter of the cable sheath.  Slit the 
tubing lengthwise.  Slipped it over the break in the cable.
Slipped a piece of shrink wrap tubing over the Tigon tubing, with 
about 1/4&quot; over the cable each side.  Shrink the tubing onto the 
cable to provide a tight, flexible covering, that will resist 
pulling from the forces imposed by the lever.

The end of the cable can be released from the lever arm using an ice 
pick to assist in bending the end of the cable.  It has a double 90 
degree bend to fit into the hole in the lever.  Poke the ice pick 
through the vent slide slots to get to the end of the cable.  
Same tool for installation.
