&gt;I'm looking for a new engine for my '71 transporter, or optionally an
&gt;entire new vehicle.  My current engine has been diagnosed as having a
&gt;couple months left (something about the crankshaft moving back and forth
&gt;the way it shouldn't).  Please mail me if you can recommend a good
&gt;replacement...

if you want a replacement BUS, there's a guy on the list who used to be
in Huntsville, AL ... Jim Macklow &lt;macklow_at_sybase_dot_com&gt; ... and he left his
79 bus up there. he's been trying to sell it (and i haven't been able to
come up with the money ... yet).

if you mean an engine, i'd recommend sticking with an original size vw
engine (i.e., get another 71 dual port single carb engine).

if you are over in the east tennessee area, there was a guy in Johnson City
who was supposed to be pretty good with vw's, but i can't for the life of
me remember his name. and it has been a long time (about ten years) so he
might be dead or retired. but if you know someone from there, it might be
worth asking about.

there was a 1972 bus advertised way down here in tuscaloosa, alabama for
$350. i have no idea what sort of shape it is/was in.

yeah, i know: i'm not much help. but i had good intentions! :)
good luck.
