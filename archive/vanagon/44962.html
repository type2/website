        On my 181 I have a temp sendor that screws into the same hole that
the oil pressure odiot-light uses I got it at my FLAPs and as I recall it is
a VDO part.
        Real easy instaliation 1.disconnect the wire from the existing oil
pressure sender (unplug the thing) 2. un-screw the sender from th engine 3.
screw the new sender in 4. plug in the oil pressure and oil temp wires 5.
start engine, watch it heat up.
