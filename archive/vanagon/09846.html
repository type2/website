&gt;Dude!  It's not a thumbs up, but a wave!  You know, you have both hands

&gt;the other person in the eye!  Raising your hand off of the wheel and
&gt;smiling are okay too if you are so inclined.  I had about a 50/50
&gt;experience on 101, with the following observations:  EVERYONE in a split
&gt;waved.  SOME of those in breadloaves waved.  FEW in bricks waved.  :(

If I see another split, I wave FRANTICALLY. I know. It's very strange, but
I can't help myself...
