          The Hoover

Bespoke the Bob, &quot;I need a lift
To get mine ass from here to there.&quot;
And sudden was the tumult raised
About the Who, What, When, and Where.

&quot;I'll drag his butt up North with me,&quot;
Said one who volunteered his car.
&quot;No, no,&quot; another voice replied,
&quot;It's East he goes, but not too far.&quot;

&quot;A Magic Carpet Ride with me!&quot;,
Said one, proclaiming life on Mars.
Another European leg
Would end in Paris, neath the stars.

&quot;A new career! We'll make him rich!
&quot;The Lecture Circuit makes the dough!
&quot;We'll pass along, across the land,
&quot;This Circuit Rider, to and fro.&quot;

Still others spoke of shorter trips,
No matter he un-willing came,
Hog-tied and gagged, he'd travel on ...
A ride's a ride, it's all the same.

Higher, louder, rose the cry,
Suggestions buzzed like summer flies,
And all the while, ol' Silent Bob
Was no more heard amongst the lies.

For none did watch nor care to see
That while the ruckus wax and wane,
The Hoover snuck out to a cab
And quietly boarded the next plane.

:)
&quot;Is anybody going to San Antone ... &quot;
