Subject: Re: East Coast Gathering



     Here's my vote for the North Carolina gathering.  Around 
Winston-Salem sounds great, although wouldn't we rather be further west 
closer to the smokey mtns.  A further drive for me, but would be worth 
the scenery.  Around Ashville is beautiful country.  Blue-ridge parkway 
maybe?
