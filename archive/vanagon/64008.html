Scott Durrant answered  my Newbie questions too. Thanks. 
He said about snow tires:

&gt;Don't run standard car tires (4-ply), they will burst.
&gt;
&gt;You want to run 8-ply tires.  These are light truck tires, but the Westys
&gt;have a beefy suspension that will handle the stiff tires, Westys were
&gt;designed for 8-ply.
&gt;
&gt;Most people will tell you to buy Yokohama or something like that; they are
&gt;really hard to find.  Bridgestone makes an 8-ply that works great (I run
&gt;them).  
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately it is hard to find any 8-ply light truck tires studded.
&gt;However, the tread looks good and most of the weight is over the axle that
&gt;is providing the power; I had a bug that was great in the snow, bet the bus
&gt;will be too.
 
I will have to check out the truck tires. It has Michelins right now, 
they are all pretty new.  


&gt;What part of the country are you in?
&gt;
Massachusetts, in the suburbs of Boston. We had record snows for two of 
the last three years. 

Thanks for the info.
