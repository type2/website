Subject: Re:cost of restoring '67

It's a bottomless pit mate..3 yeas ago we did (had done) all the front end and
running gear..last year it was all the chassis and outriggers and floors and
corners and sills and more..this year it was all the rubbers and a total
respray. Oh yeah the engine blew up last year so that's new..and so are the
reduction gears..and aagh it goes on forever! And Cee beat  me over the head
today with an old wiper motor when i said &quot; I think the bus could do
with&quot;...Bang! 
It depends on how skilled you are...how long you wanna spend doing it...we
have had ours for twenty years and only started spending serious money on it 3
years ago..but we are looking forward to a time of no kids..just us an the
open road...and hell, someone has to keep the faith..!
Good luck..go for it but be prepred to grovel to evryone including family and
long suffering bank manager..
