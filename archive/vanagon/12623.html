&gt;      I see e-mail from somebody in Minnesota who says he is looking for 
&gt; a pre-1962 double door.  I take time to respond to him because I have 
&gt; seen two of them for sale in the Auto-Trader (pretty unusual to see one, 
&gt; much less two in the same issue).  I write the ads exactly as they 
&gt; appeared in the Auto-Trader.  The first one says &quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  I write 
&gt; &quot;Rare 1960&quot;.  He responds &quot;What makes it so rare?&quot;  How the hell do I 
&gt; know?  I'm just trying to be helpful to someone who says he is looking 
&gt; for a particular split window.  The sellers phone # is included so you 
&gt; can find out why he thinks it's rare.
&gt;       Then I include my observations from the pictures in the 
&gt; Auto-Trader, &quot;...looks like rear wheel arches have been opened to allow 
&gt; bigger rear wheels.&quot;  He responds &quot;Don't want any hack jobs.&quot;  Buy your
&gt; vehicle in Minnesota then.  Be sure to get one that already has the 
&gt; rusted out rear wheel arches replaced so you don't end up with a&quot; hack 
&gt; job&quot;.  How much do those arches cost, $50-100 each plus installation?

	Yes, Jim I think you're right.  You were trying to be helpful and 
the recipient of your info should probably been a tad more gracious, 
whether he was going to use the listings or not.  Please don't let this 
turn you off being helpful though.  Those of use who live in the rust 
belt have to look south for good vehicles to restore and drive.  Keep up 
the good work.  Kudos!
