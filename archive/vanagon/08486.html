Subject: Re: 91 Vanagon has rattle comming from front wheel
Date: Tue, 20 Dec 94 15:23:02 PST

&gt; 
&gt; I have a 91 Vanagon and now am getting a rattle (cyclic) sound from the 
&gt; right front wheel at low speeds...Its very prevelant when I take a slow right
&gt; turn or after I hit the break and let up. Its kind of a tink-tink-tink sound...
&gt; Could it be my break calipers, CV joints or wheelbearings???
&gt; I had the rotors replaced within the last 5k miles...pads too....
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance John

  Several suggestions:

  If the brake pads were aftermarket items, they may not fit correctly in the
  calipers and will rattle. I would suspect this if the sound disappears when
  the brakes are applied. I would also check the caliper mounting bolts. They
  had to be removed if the rotors were changed and if those ba*tards forgot to
  tighten them...... Anyway, you DO NOT want your calipers to come undone
  when you use the brakes. If the sound is kind of &quot;squinch, squinch, squinch&quot;
  &lt;sorry&gt;, it could be the wheel cover - take it off and see if the noise goes
  away. If one of the lug nuts falls out when you do this, you have also 
  located your problem. You might want to check them for proper torque anyway, 
  but the sound of loose lug nuts is more clunky than rattley &lt;is that a real
  word?&gt; 
  BTW, my Olds station wagon has the loose pads in calipers syndrome and it 
  doesn't appear to generate any more trouble than the noise.

  Good Luck,
