&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;   I saw this question on the list and had to respond.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Has anyone else ever seen a childs cot for a Vanagon Westy?
&gt;I didn't know they existed.
&gt;
&gt;As far as I know, they do not.  However, I have put one in my '82.  I found
&gt;a good cot with one pole from '73 and had a good  pole from a '79 and
&gt;combined the 2.  I didn't put much effort into the job.  Basically my wife
&gt;and I held the poles up and found where the fit best.  Marked the spot, put
&gt;of the brakets and TaDaaa, a bed.  I use the slider (from '79) for the
&gt;front pole. It can safely be extended out past the fixed poles, making it
&gt;fit the front window better.  Anyway, there isn't alot of room between the
&gt;cot and the roof of the camper (about 2 feet), but my daughter lovers it.
&gt;There is a space on each end of the cot that I neatly fill with the seats.
&gt;The headrest stick up nicely filling the space. One problem I have
&gt;encounted is the curtain.  I can't bring myself to cut it, so I place dark
&gt;blanks (until I get something better) on the outside of the front windows.
&gt;I hood them in place with the doors.  Well, thats my 2 cents.  Take care.

Jim,

They actually do exist.  Looking in the Westfalia catalog dated 9/93, there
is clearly a &quot;Kinderbetten / Ablagen im Faherhaus&quot; shown.  The text reads:

     Zum Einhagen quer im Faherhaus; 2 Teleskopstangen mit
     hochwertigem Segeltuch; bis 40 kg belastbar.  Gewicht: 4kg.

Unfortunately, it wasn't listed on the 5/96 price list, so it may be out of
stock.  They don't seem to make one for the Eurovan, surprisingly enough.

Ron
