Subject: q about common vanagon body parts

     Hello All,
     
     I am searching for some body parts for my 1987 Vanagon Westy.
     
     My question is:  Which model years on used vanagons have common parts 
     that will fit on my van?
     
     I need a rear hatch, front bumper, rear bumper, and a right rear 
     taillight assembly.
     
     Thank you in advance.
