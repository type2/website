&gt; I still wish to find another engine to put in there, but I expect that
&gt; I have to pay much more than $500 now.:( Does anyone have a good lead
&gt; for me on this quest? Would it be cheap enough to buy the crankcase
&gt; and other parts seperately and put it together myself?

No to the last question.  Individual parts are expensive.  Hold out a
while, keep your eyes peeled, and you will find another one for $500
or less.

&gt; Also, the speedometer is off by almost 10 miles/hour - the speedometer
&gt; said 68-70 while I was really going 60. The tire size is
&gt; 175/60R14. Any ideas?

I would suggest putting the correct size tire on the van.  175-60-14 is
*way* *WAY* too small!  I run 195-75-14's.

&gt; Is the ice box/sink worth much? I don't believe that I will need it
&gt; and would like to get a couple bucks for it.

I almost never use my sink.  I use the fridge all the time.  If it were
only an icebox I might dump it in favor of one of those kool-tron things.
In fact, I definately would.

&gt; Oh yeah, almost forgot...along with my getting a Westy in good
&gt; condition for $500, for an extra $20 I got an EMPI oil cooler still in
&gt; its' package. Where is the recommended position to put this? I see
&gt; that the FAQ is missing information about these items.

Wanna sell it?  I need one.  :)
