Subject: '81 Aircooled Vanagon FS, in CO $350

I have an '81 Vanagon L for sale in Denver. The motor and trans are already
gone, 
but everything else is still there. It has no rust, but some slight damage
near the left turn signal. I am asking $350, it has a clear CO title. I would
also consider parting it out, if I do not sell the Van as a whole. Please
E-mail if interested.
Thanks,
Josh
