Subject: How do I put a Vanagon mtr in a late Bus?

I am in the process of trying to put an '82 Vanagon 2L motor in a 
'76 bus.  I expected to do a lot of changing over - fan shroud, 
alternator, etc. - but one thing I did not expect is that the bus &amp; 
Vanagon heater boxes seem completely incompatable.  In other words, 
the Vanagon heater boxes won't fit the bus, and the bus heater 
boxes won't bolt to the Vanagon motor's heads.  Has anyone done 
this installation before?  What is my solution?  What other 
problems should I expect trying to make this Vanagon motor work in 
the bus?
