The heater guru in Colorado is:

One other post described the owner (Joe Boerico) as a &quot;jerk.&quot;  He may be.
I'm not interested in a flame war over him but he was courteous to me over the 
phone, fixed my unit at the agreed on price and in a competent manner after 
answering several of my questions.  He's not cheap but he gives good value 
and quality for what he charges.  If someone else had a negative 
experience, then I'm sorry for them because I've been in their shoes and 
its no fun.  In any event, I suggest you call him before cutting anything 
in any bus.  He may be rude to you or he may save you from doing harm to your 
vehicle.
