ric:

i sure you story strikes a chord with just about everybody on this list! i
know that it is one of our worst fears to think of our cherished ride
crumpled into a tin can! Thank God your wife wasn't sitting in the car!

Perhaps there is something to be said for not sitting in your car in the
breakdown lane. A few months ago a couple of people up here died in an
accident which involved having the back of their car crashed into while
parked in the breakdown lane. Maybe there is something that can be learned
from this most unfortunate accident!

&gt;I know that this is the Typ2 list, however please bear with me on this...
&gt;
&gt;January 7, 1980 - February 17, 1995
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It is with much sadness that I announce the death of our recently
&gt;purchased Bug Convertible which was totaled out when struck by
&gt;a delivery truck travelling in the breakdown lane while the
&gt;driver was asleep.
&gt;
&gt;My wife was driving HER convertible when it developed engine trouble,
&gt;she promptly pulled to the far side of the break-down lane on the
&gt;interstate, checked to see if there was anything she could
&gt;do to fix the problem...then got a ride to the dealer's so they
&gt;could go out and fetch the car.
&gt;
&gt;About two to five minutes after she left, the truck hit the bug..
&gt;dead center in the back...shattering the brand new factory rebuilt
&gt;motor as well as the transmission...forced the car into a gully
&gt;at which time the truck rode over the top of the bug and
&gt;caused the bug to roll over twice before both bug and truck
&gt;came to rest in the trees on the upside of the gully.
&gt;
&gt;Fortunately, my wife was not in the car....otherwise I would
&gt;be preparing an obituary of a different type. Our two-year-old
&gt;Alex is very upset his &quot;New Bug&quot; as he called it is not
&gt;dead.....
&gt;
&gt;So folks, if you would sometime this weekend, hoist a beer/or
&gt;observe a moment of silence in memory of &quot;New Bug&quot;...cut down
&gt;in the prime of life at 45,000 miles!
&gt;
