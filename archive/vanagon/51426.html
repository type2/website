I don't see how it could be a &quot;drop-in&quot; because the Digijet FI system has a
coolant temperature sensor that supplies the computer with info about the
warm-up state of the engine. What would you do with this on an air-cooled
engine? There are probably other reasons this won't work very well. There
are easier ways to replace points with non-mechanical pickups. Search the
archives for &quot;Pertronix&quot; for more info.
