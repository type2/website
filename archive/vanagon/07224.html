So John Tauxe says:
&gt; 
&gt; Hello, all you VW nuts.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm new to this list, and have been amused by all this talk about air
&gt; conditioning and refrigerators... Spare me!  :)  I have a 76 Westfalia (now
&gt; in TN) which I drove around Texas for nigh ten years (even to big Bend Nat'l
&gt; Park, where I did a lot of impromptu repairs) with no AC or fridge.  No
&gt; problem.  

Looks like Joel beat me to the punch on a response to this, but I spent ten
years in my '68 bug with no AC.  When your young and have no money, it doesn't
matter.  When you fall into the old fart but have money category, you buy
those pleasant options without a second thought.  

&gt; Anyway, I noticed something else that you folks probably already know, since
&gt; it seemed so obvious.  In the list of models, each was produced for 12
&gt; years, it seems.  Is this a coincidence, or is it part of a Master VW Plan
&gt; that just when they get the bugs (no pun intended) worked out they
&gt; completely redesign the vehicle?  Do we anticipate that 2003 will be the
&gt; last year ofthe Eurovan?

I think great cars get yanked off of the market no matter what company made
it.  It's not cost effective for the company selling it.  The only time it's
cost effective is when they're trying to get a foot in the door e.g. the 
Japanese did with there econo boxes.  Now they've slacked off on economy
and have gone to the suped up luxo models like the 'Merican companies.
VW has gone that way too, I'm afraid.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, has anyone seen the Winnebago camper conversion for the Eurovan yet?

I saw one up in Bend, Oregon last Sept.  Nicely layed out.  Pretty similar
to the Vanagon.  Bigger sink and fridge.  I don't the the front seat controls.
Too archaic.  The lower bed is a little narrower.  Comes with a heater for
camping.  It's definately outta my price range though.  $31,000.
