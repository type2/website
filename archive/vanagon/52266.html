&gt; first waterboxer. Does anybody know what gaskets and sealants that I
&gt; will need for this?

Steve, it is actually a relatively simple engine work compare to most
other engines of cars. I was able to drop my 84 vanagon engine myself
and put it back in with a little hand from my wife. Rebuilding it was
fairly simple. I believe you will probably find that the cylinders and
pistons are all still in excellent shape, at least mine were at 116k
miles. The cylinder heads, especially the exhaust valves are the ones
that were in need of work. 

A VW dealer in my local area told me that they had rebuilt heads for
about $200 each, include a full set of gaskets and sealants. The heads
were rebuilt original VW heads with all new valves. If your engine does
not burn oil most likely you only need to replace the cylinder heads
and replace the gaskets and reseal the heads.

I pulled apart my 84 engine because of leaking collant from the cylinder/
head joint. I replaced gaskets and resealed the heads only. The engine
is still quite strong. I often drive it at 70MPH on the freeway still.
If you go for the dealer they will ask more than $2.5K for the job. BTW,
the gasket/sealant set is of a brand called REINZ (made in Germany). 
I believe VW dealers use it too. I found it excellent in quality. It costed
me $194.98 + tax. I used less than half of the sealant only. 

Good luck.
