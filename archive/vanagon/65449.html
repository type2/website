     Electric window trick:

     It did NOT work on my '91

     Insurance of Westfalia stove, fridge, etc:

     In my case, anything that is &quot;part of the car&quot; is covered; anything
     that is not is personal property coverd by my homeowner's insurance.

     How &quot;anal&quot; insurance companies can be about this distinction became
     very clear to me several years ago.  I had a camera bag &quot;lifted&quot; at
     the Philadelphia airport (like the license plate used to say, &quot;You
     have a Friend in Pennsylvania&quot;).  My keys were also inside.
     Homeowner's insurance covered the camera, and every key on the key
     ring except the car keys; they were considered &quot;part of the car&quot;.
