When we first got The Bozobus running (after his long hiatus) in '76, it
was winter.  Cranked on the heater and blew a vast amount of crud out
across the windshield and roofline, and onto the people huddle on the
engine cover in the back.  What the original heater ('61) lacked in &quot;fresh
air&quot; it more than made up for in sheer volume.  (This type of heater used
almost *all* of the fan's output volume (less leakage).)

If I could build an engine that 'wouldn't leak at all' I'd go back to the
original heater...

&quot;Heat exchangers?  I don't need no steenkin' heat exchangers!&quot;
