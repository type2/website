Subject: tree trimming party at martha's


Yet another excuse for a VW party!  I've talked to a few people already, and
this is definitely going to fly.  

What:  tree trimming party, general hysteria, indoor pyrostunts, etc.
Where:  /martha's house - if you haven't been here before, when you rsvp,
        let me know, and I'll send you directions
When:  Friday, December 15th at 5 p.m.thru as late as anyone wants.  It's ok
       to camp here, too, if anyone wants.  Indoor space also available.

Personally, I will not be able to be here right at 5 p.m., on account of a
rehearsal I have which doesn't end until 6 p.m., but I'll have things set up
and put out in advance, and probably some of the regulars like the Kautzes
and Bradley will be here to greet the masses and get things rolling.  I'll be
back shortly after things are underwasy.  

I'll have a tree, lights, and ornaments and you guys can get as creative
as you like, so long as you agree to contain the explosions and open flames.  :)

I guess we can do potluck, will think on that.  You can bring what ever you
like to drink/inbibe/etc.  In the meantime, I'll think on the food plans.  All
suggestions welcome.

Please RSVP ASAP.  TIA, /m
