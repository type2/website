Subject: RE: Corvair engines

Speaking of who borrowed ideas from where, there's a little aircraft
museum at Teterboro Airport here in north Jersey, including a Korean war
helicopter like you've seen ferrying the wounded on M*A*S*H.  The engine
is a flat six, placed vertically, and looks a LOT like a Corvair engine.

I had a 64 Corvair, 110hp, 4-speed, that I liked a lot.  This was before
I discovered changing my own oil and other secrets of the inner circle,
so I didn't spend much time under the hood.  I do remember the incredible
difference between the car's handling when I bought it, with 22psi in
the tires front and rear, and the handling from day 2 on, with 24psi front
and 36 psi rear.  If Ralph Nader had known how to use a tire pump, he
would never have gotten his start.
