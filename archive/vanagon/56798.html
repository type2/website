Subject: 2.1L into '85 GL

I'm looking for any tips on swapping a 2.1L engine into my '85 GL
(originally with 1.9L)

	The salvage guy who has a very low mileage 2.1( 35K) says that all I
need to do switch around the location of the thermostat housing from
left front of head to left rear... and change the coolant fitting to the
right front of head...

	says it is any easy swap provided you have a complete 1.9 for all the
donor pieces( t-stat housing, coolant fittings, exhaust...)

	any comments from those who have done this conversion??

	I've been looking for a good 1.9L for over 6 months and haven't found
anything... this 2.1L came available this weekend for $950...
	I feel the bigger engine (more HP and lots more torque) would be a
definite asset... and 'bout 1/2 of what I would spend on a
remanufactured engine from VW, AVP, Boston Engine, etc....

	I really miss my Van, I even bought an '82 to drive till I could find
the right engine... just sold that to a new Listee (Hi Jamie...) so  now
I want my Van running fairly quickly...


	TIA
