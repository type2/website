&gt;Has anyone ever mounted one of those inline boosters under
&gt;the drivers seat in a van ?
&gt;You know the ones I mean ..... as advertised in J.C.
&gt;Whitney and the most recent issue of Cool VW's.

yup. it helps a lot at low rpm. so you don't have to sit at red lights,
running the engine at 3000 rpm just to get some air flow.  get a good one;
someone suggested a bilge fan from a boating supply place.

&gt;By the way, I need to go under my '69 camper and take a
&gt;hard look at the heater tube.  Am i gonna die from asbestos inhalation ?

only if you make a lot of dust and breathe it every day for three years.
get some dust-masks (see your local auto bodyshop supply store). goodluck.
