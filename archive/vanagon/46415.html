Subject: re:The impending split

All,
Since everyone else feels the need to jump in with their $.02, I may as well
ante up, so I have a chance at the pot.

I must say I am divided on the split(good one eh?).  On one hand I have to say
that the info gained from waterpumper woes does not an aircooled solution
make. On the other hand some of the info gained from waterpumper woes has
an aircooled solution made.  Figure that one out.



Cheers,

David

&gt; &gt;Where do we get one!

&gt; &gt;Can someone post the details on this?
&gt; &gt;Thanks!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: VW credit card
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Got a call over the weekend from MBNA and accepted a credit card that
&gt; &gt;&gt; builds
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; toward a $3,500 potential rebate on a VW product. Normally I blow these
&gt; &gt;&gt; things
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; off but since the &quot;new beetle&quot; might be a real car, and Lord knows I
&gt; &gt;&gt; charge
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enough, and I happen to have a newly teen-aged daughter, I thought that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; possibly all these threads might converge a few years hence.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Poor Richard &quot;Wandering Hippie&quot; Palmer turned me on to this VW Visa this
&gt; &gt;&gt; past
&gt; &gt;&gt; year.  Be sure to get the &quot;standard&quot; and not the &quot;gold&quot; card - the VW
&gt; &gt;&gt; graphic on
&gt; &gt;&gt; the card is much better!  I don't use it much but do show it off to other VW
&gt; &gt;&gt; owners.
&gt; &gt;&gt; RMMW has one too.
