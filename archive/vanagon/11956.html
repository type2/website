&gt;&gt;    I'm considering the diesel over the gas version, mainly because of its
&gt;&gt;fuel
&gt;&gt;   economy (I realize air isn't available in the diesels).  How reliable is
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Interesting.   I'd say, for the Vanagon westy, (My cousin has an '87 gas and
&gt;I have the '81 diesel), You're definitely better off with the gas.  The
&gt;gas one gets about the same miles/gallon if you drive it gently.  The Diesel
&gt;Westy is said to get 28 mpg, but I never got better than 23-24 --  with the
&gt;diesel, your foot tends to floor the accelerator at all times.
