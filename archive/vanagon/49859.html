Subject: The Inuvik Run -- Leaving Inuvik


The Inuvik Run - Departing Inuvik

2 August

(The following is from my trip-log notebook.)

&quot;1224, Friday 2 Aug '96, 91,342 miles - 263.0 hours.  Trying to
depart Inuvik.  Just finished with Jorge's front wheel bearing. 
Unable to dismount Eddie's wheel with my 3/4&quot; breaker bar &amp; 60&quot;
cheater but managed to bend both, indicating his wheel is torqued
to more than 1200 ft/lbs.  Waiting to help Sue with her air filter.
I am blocked in.  I can not leave until their maintenance is done.&quot;

(The next entry reads:)

&quot;1632, 2-8-96, 91427, 265.6.  85 miles made good in 2.6 engine
hours.  Waiting for the ferry.  Delayed by an 'interview'.  Got
underway about 1400.&quot;

(After-trip comments:)

Getting underway from Inuvik proved especially difficult.  After
helping with the repairs to several vehicles I followed the crowd
downtown to the church and sat in the bus reading.  Enjoyed a nice
chat with an old Indian man who told me one of his friends
inherited a bus like mine ('...with the divided windscreen') but it
failed to survive the first winter due to a frozen battery.  He
said it was still there in the woods behind his friend's house. 
The Indian called it a 'windscreen', not a 'windshield'.  I wonder
if this is the common Canadian usage?  

After waiting for about an hour I wandered over to the grocery
store for a belated breakfast of donuts and milk.  Coming back from
the grocery store I saw the trekkies huddled in a group, waving at
me.  I waved back.  The huddle turned out to be the fabled
interview and group photo.  And they weren't waving, they were
gesturing for me to hurry.  When I was about five feet from the
group they faced front and the shutter clicked.  After hours of
delay they were suddenly in such a rush they couldn't wait for
Tail-end Charlie.  

The sudden rush might of made sense except there were more delays
to follow, people driving off to refuel or going to the drugstore
or a last visit to the bathroom.  I climbed back into the bus,
drank a liter of milk, ate some donuts and read.  

We eventually rolled out of town nose-to-tail for the benefit of
the local newspaper photographer, snapping stills of as we puttered
by.  Once out of town someone discovered they were out of fuel and
needed to return to the gas station.  Eddie offered to bowser them
from his jerry cans.  The others drove on.  I stopped to back-up
Eddie.  He had the only bus using my type of rim.  Indeed, he was
running on one of my spares.  It made sense to stay near him and I
could always hit the convoy with my more powerful radio should
there be a problem.

On the south side of the Fort McPherson ferry crossing we came upon
a pair of Volkswagen buses.  We stopped and chatted.  They were
Vanagon list members from Ontario who were unable to match the
tour's schedule.  They had prepared attractive lapel buttons and
gave one to each of us.  Since I knew them from the list I made
only a cryptic &quot;B. pins.  Temp dropping.  W. wind freshening.&quot; 
After the trip I saw the note but for the life of me I could not
put a name to the initial 'B.'  

(The mysterious 'B' -- Jack Batemann from Ontario -- had made up
the pins and driven five thousand miles to deliver them.  And I had
forgotten the name.  I could not upload this part of the trip log
without filling in the missing name.  I delayed posting this entry
for more than a week but was unable to fill in the blanks.  I
finally posted a public appeal to the Inuvik list and Jack was kind
enough to jog my memory.)  

During our stay in Inuvik the weather was delightful but as we
headed south toward the Arctic Circle we encountered strong gusty
winds.  We could only watch as the southwestern horizon became
ominously dark.  We reached Eagle Plains about 2200, shortly before
the gas station closed.  The weather had closed down with
remarkable speed and we were being pelted with showers of rain and
rocked by strong winds.  Having experienced muddy conditions on our
way north I proposed continuing, hoping to reach the valley of the
Peel River ahead of the rain.  Sue Booth, the other solo driver in
our group of four vans, was willing but dead tired and hungry.

During our last stop before Eagle Plains I piled some cans of food
around the cargo bay heater outlet.  When we got to Eagle Plains I
had my choice of beef stew, ravioli or pork &amp; beans, all piping
hot.  I shared the hot food with Sue who ate some stew and promptly
fell asleep with her interior light on.  I let her sleep about an
hour then knocked on her window.  She was dead to the world but it
woke up her dog who barked her awake.  Sue was still willing to
push on so we headed south, down from Eagle Plains, hoping to reach
the valley of the Peel River before roads turned to muck.

We didn't make it.  The drive was a nightmare of mud and rain.  In
fact, our decision to push on was probably wrong.  Those who stayed
the night at Eagle Plains drove south the following day under
clearing skies.  The rain stopped in the night and by mid-morning
the road was wet but not seriously muddy.

My real worry was snow.  And ice.  Since crossing the pass thru the
Richardson Mountains the temperature had been dropping as the
weather worsened.  The Plains of the Eagle River is a plateau high
enough to enjoy freezing temperatures even in August.  I wanted to
get down off the plateau.  My goal was Engineer Creek Campground
between the Ogilive and Blackstone Rivers, tributaries of the Peel,
about a hundred miles south of Eagle Plains and fifteen hundred
feet lower in elevation.

We reached the Provincial Park campground about thirteen hours
after departing Inuvik.  Eddie and the Freemans continued south
toward Dawson but I'd played out my string, having been awake more
than twenty hours.

I can't say very much about the campground at Engineer Creek.  I
can't even be sure that is it's name.  But it will be forever fixed
in my memory for the size and voraciousness of its mosquitos.  As
I prepared for bed they clustered on the outside of the glass. 
Several found their way inside through the overhead vent -- which
is unscreened -- and feasted on me during our six hour stay in the
park.

If sleep is fuel, Sue and I took on about a quarter of a tank
before pushing on south toward Dawson and showers and mosquitos
that could not penetrate three layers of clothing.  As I drove, the
mosquitos that discovered my unscreened vents eventually came
within range of my hand.  The inside of the windscreen was soon
covered with bloody smears.  On the road near the campground are
yellow caution signs.  They carried no verbal warning, only a
picture of a large mosquito carrying away a man.
