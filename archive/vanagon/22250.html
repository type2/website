hello
what you are looking for are commonly referred to as plate speakers.
i highly recommend blaupunkt model rl5420p, but any quality manufacturer (ie
infinity, jbl etc ) would be a sound investment;) they make generics too but
your talkin to a jukebox junkie here.
good luck &amp; if you have any...
