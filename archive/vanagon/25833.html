                      RE&gt;&gt;Insurance Industry Regu                  9/29/95

Two issues here:
    1)  I got this message twice (one of our current and infamous &quot;duplicate&quot;
messages.  I noticed that the sender address on the first receipt was 
yvonner_at_CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU.  The second receipt the sender address was 
yvonner_at_ccit.arizona_dot_edu  (all lower case)  does this make any difference?

   2)  I have noticed a couple of folks have addressed this topic of Insurance
Industry Regulations and attributed statements to me as included below.  This
is not accurate.  My comments addressed the insurance company I deal with,
USAA, which is an alternative for current, retired, and former military
officers (USAA &quot;members&quot;).  They are the only population served by this
company, and it's financial objectives are to serve it's members, not to
maximize or for that matter even generate profit beyond what is necessary to
operate the company and serve it's members.  If losses/claims are below
projections, each member is rebated a prorated share of the excess.

--------------------------------------
[Harvey's correction, the text attributed to me immediatly following was my
repeating what some other  individual said, and that I had included to provide
context for my own comments about USAA.]

&gt; 
&gt; In other words, insurance co's are profit-making institutions, as any legit
&gt; business must be. But &gt; like you've described.
&gt; 
&gt; Any chance that government restrictions before the election, were so severe,
&gt; that even legit, clean companies could only lose money? I have no info
