Subject: My 85 is running rough again!

Hi fellows!
Last week I was celebrating my victory over the rough intermitent ride of
my 85 GL. Surprise! I took it for a 3 hours ride and the problem came my
headache again. This time changed all the vacuum hoses, put another flow-
meter, main control unit, trottle switch, checked the injector's pattern,
clean the plugs and the rough idle in low is still there.  A friend of
mine told me to change the coil and eliminate the 02 sensor, I don't know
what to do already. Any comment or suggestion will be more than welcome.

Peace,
Angel
