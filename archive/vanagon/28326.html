Does it strike anyone else as odd (or amusing) that my thirty-year-old
get-that-polluting-piece-of-junk-off-the-road-you-hippie microbus gets
better mileage than a brand-new van (it seems like the numbers Herr
Tommaselli quotes are typical for any of the major manufacturers'
vans)?  My last fill-up (yesterday) came out dead on 22 mpg (US
measurements).  This is with a mix of city and highway driving, mostly
with either some cargo or passengers.

and I say:
  my best gas milage came from my old 59 bus (why did I ever sell Gus?)
  This had a 1600 SP H case motor I religiously changed oil and tuned up
every 3000 miles,  and a split case tranny.   For three years I regularly got
28mpg,   31 freeway.   Once I got 40mpg  driving UP the Sierras  with three
friends, a baby,  and camping gear,  don't ask me how.
         The beater bug gets~25 and the 61 ~21.   I  haven't figured milage
on the 54, it should be better.
