&gt;     Well, I found one! I just contracted to purchase an '82 Westy with a 
&gt;     somewhat tired (possible cracked block) diesel engine. This is the van 
&gt;     I have been wanting for a few years now. Unfortunately, I will not be 
&gt;     able to keep my '88 and the '82. So, I must bid the trusty '88 
&gt;     farewell. :(

It seems to me that your &quot;transmission is in reverse.&quot;

&gt;     Getting an '82 Westy diesel...soon to be re-powered?

You must have something big up your sleeves!
