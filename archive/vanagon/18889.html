Subject: Anyone fixed Type 2 heater box  flap lever?

	Friends,
	A careful inspection shows that the operating lever for
one of my heater box air flaps is gone- just the shaft sticking
out of the heater box sheetmetal. I recall there are repair kits
for this, short of buying a new heater box. Anyone here done it?
Have an opinion of doing it?
	I can wire the thing OFF during the summer and ON during 
the winter, but I'd rather do it 'right'. Will check the Wolfsburg 
West and Bus Stop catalogs tonight... I'd check my Bus Boys catalog,
Jim, but they're not out yet :) 
	I remember spending a lot of time on this part of my 914- 
deja vu all over again!
	As long as the *($*)$%# engine installation isn't done yet,
this seems like the perfect time to fix this bit.
	I'll take hints directly, and post my successes/failures.
