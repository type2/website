Subject: New Heads, Then Rebuild Your Old Ones


&gt; Some time over the next few months, whenever you get around to it, overhaul
&gt; your old heads. (If you ask, I'll tell you how.)

Did you know that would come back to haunt you? ;)

Here's what:

I'm putting one 1600 together out of what I can glean from two old; new
parts where I need them. Engine A was loaned, with its requisite bus, to my
brother, who has no sense. He bludgeoned it to death. Demise by seizure.
Neuro-toxin.

Engine B was bought cheap from somebody who had pulled it out of the 914
where it had been installed (wierd angle-iron brackets bolted to it, case
trimmed) and let it sit out in the weather.

A's heads, come to find, are cracked where the spark plugs cracked them. I
suppose they would run still a while, but when the while is up I expect
they'd expectorate shrapnel into the cylinders.

B's heads have got rust but no cracks. I've never had one rusted and I
don't know what to do. They're pretty rusty. I had to pound the valves
loose. There's a little play in the guides but they seem clean. I'd like to
put new ones in and regrind the seats (if I can save the heads). You quote
Whitney at ninety dollars per new head; are mine worth saving? Learning to
do it is worth something, but if I have to send it to a machinist I may as
well buy new.
