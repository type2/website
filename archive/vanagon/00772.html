Subject: '71 wiring harness sources?

I'm thinking of replacing the wiring harness in my '71 Westy as previous
owners have really hacked it up, including the ignition switch wiring, turn
signals, etc.  I'm considering JC Whitney, but has anybody got any other
sources or has purchased one from JC Whitney?  How was the installation?  Do
they come with diagrams and instructions?  Also, is there a source for keys/
lock cylinders/ignition switches?  I want to replace the ignition switch as
it's mounted on some type of kludged up panel, but most of the places I've
seen just offer the switch but no cylinder.  Does anyone know if this year
bus can use the same switch as a beetle?  Thanks,

Pat Walsh, walshp_at_indy.navy_dot_mil, '71 Westy
