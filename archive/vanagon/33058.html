Subject: Re: odd brick

&gt;Driving home, I noticed a '70s-era brick with what looked to be almost a=
&gt; radiator along the front -- I guessed it was some kind of ventilation unit,=
&gt; it looked very good, like it had come from the factory that way -- anyone=
&gt; have any guesses as to what it was..?
&gt;
&gt;Then there was the v.cool Eurovan pickup I saw a while back...
&gt;
&gt;

Probably a modern-day Mexican Kombi.  I saw lots of them recently.  Bay
window-looking bus with a watercooled engine.
