               Don't Tent Me In

Oh, give me room, lots of room, with a camper top above,
       Don't tent me in.
Let me ride in my pride through the open countryside,
       Don't tent me in.
Oh, let me sleep near the deep, on the sandy beaches,
    All those other places that my camper reaches,
    Cause I don't like lying on the ground with leaches!
       Don't tent me in.

Oh, make my ride big inside, big as rooms in houses,
       Don't tent me in.
Make it large as a barge, so there's room for spouses,
       Don't tent me in.
And put a top that will pop and will raise the ceiling,
    With a bed in back to help that sleepy feeling,
    Add some kitchen cabinets and we're really wheeling!
       Don't tent me in.

Oh, let it sell really well, so the dealers love it,
       Don't tent me in.
So the farts back in parts don't tell me to shove it,
       Don't tent me in.
But let it not be so hot for the Yuppie princes,
    Make it sell for prices that won't make me winces,
    Cause I can't stand Porsches and I can't stand Benzes,
       Don't tent me in.

Oh, give me zoom, lots of zoom, in a hurry slowly,
       Don't tent me in.
Let me roll at a stroll through the traffic lowly,
       Don't tent me in.
Oh, let me sit where I get all the view that's needy,
    Sitting way up high is better, yes, indeedie,
    Even though at times I might not be so speedy!
       Don't tent me in.
