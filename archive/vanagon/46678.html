Subject: I'm back

Hello listies
     I found out that I had been set to the postpone mode.  Gerry was a big
help, he set me straight in one message.  My van is down again, I just
returned form a 1000 mile trip to Kansas.  The starter has refused to start.
I will have to pull  it this weekend.  Any one have any tips on starter
removal on an '86 Syncro.  I will have a more complete trip update later.
     Its good to be back, I was going into heavy withdrawl.  
Bye for now.
Colin A Moran

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
