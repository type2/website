Subject:       Sliding Door Problem

Folks,

On my 86 Vanagon, the sliding door pops open when the van is moving.  
When stopped and door in closed position the door appears to be 
locked in place you can't shake it open.

Can't see anything broken or out of place.  What do I need to 
adjust??

Thanks,

Butch
