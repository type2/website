Subject: New to list

I'm new to the list (courtesy of Rick Gordon)
so, I guess I should introduce myself instead of eavesdropping on
everyone's conversations...

Homer Christensen
Homette (Cheri)
Homster (84 Westfalia)
Homeys (Ragnar Lodbok &amp; Tomina Loki)

All located on Bainbridge Island in the beautiful Pacific NW.

Skoal!

BTW, My 84 westy's side door also sticks at the back end of the door. 
Kind of a pain, having to unlatch it and simultaneously pull outwards on 
the back of the door.

And another thing: I noticed that when I gas up with BP--even their 
high-test--I get occasional power &quot;drops&quot; as if I'm running out of gas. 
When I fill up with Texaco, I don't have the problem. After listening to 
the list, I'm definitely changing my fuel filter and staying away from BP.
