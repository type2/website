Yeah, what steve said.  The brake pads and shoes will also rust in place on
the rotors/drums in very short time. not a big deal, but something to avoid.

&gt;&gt; Hi all
&gt;&gt; I am watching a friends Westy ('84 'ish?). For the winter. Any suggestions
&gt;&gt; for maintenance besides keeping the tank full and starting it weekly? I am in
&gt;&gt; Colorado where it will be kept covered but outside.
&gt;
&gt;Take it for a drive weekly.  Don't just run the engine.  Or the tires will
&gt;be flat on one side.  It also keeps the tranny and bearings lubed and burns
&gt;the corrosion off better.
