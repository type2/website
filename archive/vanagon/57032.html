Subject: Re: front brakes don't bleed (?)

I had a similar problem on my Rabbit. The little pin hole near the base of the bleeder screw was corroded shut and wouldn't let the fluid through. I removed the bleeder screw, soaked it in liquid wrench for a bit, and was able to scrape the hole open. By the way, with the screw removed, you shouldn't have any problem getting fluid :).

&lt;&lt;what's the trick?
i've done this a jillion times on other vehicles -- another secret VW handshake?

i have an 85GL.  2 bleeder screws on each caliper.
i open 'em all the way and don't get any fluid no matter how much i pump.

front brakes are fine.  i just want to change out my fluid with fresh DOT 4.

thanks,
