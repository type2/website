&gt; Does the Pickup category include single cabs AND double cabs?

yup. and the camper includes Westfalia's and other brands (Dormobile,
Adventurewagen, Devon, etc.). didn't have enough room on the screen to
split it all out like it should be ... too many variations of buses!! :)

&gt;I see alot of bay window double cabs around Costa Mesa, CA and was just
&gt;curious.

?? hmmm. musta have a really enthused dealer there at some time. i still
want that single cab syncro pickup!!!! :(  but i don't think 7-11's and
zippy marts carry that kind of cash. :(
