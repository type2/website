]I have a rack which hangs on the tailgate, and holds two bikes well above
]the taillights.  If I'm worried about theft, I run a cable through the bikes
]and lock it to one of the tiedowns under the bumper.  It's the same
]everywhere: if they really want the bike, they'll get it.

I have a similar strap-mounted rack that mounts on the tailgate.  In my
case it was the cheapest thing I could find at the time (probably K-Mart
or some such - too many years ago to remember) and it has served us for
over 15 years.  We used to carry two bikes on it when going camping, one
a 55-lb. tandem that stuck out both sides.  It did make it kinda hard to
open the hatch, though, with all that weight on it.  I managed the theft
problem by always having bikes that no one else would want.   :-\
