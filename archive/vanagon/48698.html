Haaa hooo haha!!

Cmon Bob, now you're hitting below the belt. The out-back stuff is
funny, but once you start insulting our teeth...


&gt;
&gt;In both of these cases I assume the people thought I was Canadian based on
&gt;factors mentioned above since I made no conscious effort to 'appear'
&gt;Canadian.  I am an American.  And proudly so.

Have you ever considered that they thought you were Canadian because
you were IN CANADA??? Besides, most of you guys have such a heavy
drawl and can't pronounce 'eh' properly... :)

Apologies for the waste of bandwidth..
