The balck cap you recieved is an updated.  The &quot;plastic&quot; cover is actually
the new radio interference shield and it eliminates the need for the metal
one.  The improvement is that the wires would somtimes short to the metal
shield due to dirt and stuff collecting on the cap and wires.  The new style
cap eliminates this problem. The plastic cap uses the mounting clips to
replace the braided ground wire.  All Vanagons can be upgraded to the later
cap and I highly recomend it.  BTW, the plastic shield can also be removed
and transfered to a cap without a shield in place.  Getting the cap without
the shield will save some money.
