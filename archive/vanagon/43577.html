Subject: Re: Vanagons: How lumpy is your idle?

&gt;Vanagons (wasserboxers) are notorious for their irregular idle. My '87 2.1l 
&gt;certainly doesn't idle as smoothly as I'd like it to. I'm just curious how 
&gt;lumpy the idle is on other similar Vanagons. With mine, the engine shakes 
&gt;and often I can feel the shake in the driver's seat. The shifter vibrates 
&gt;back and forth. The lumpiness is periodic--it runs smooth for several 
&gt;seconds and then shakes a bit and then recovers and so on and so on. I've 
&gt;wondered if my O2 sensor is responding too slowly.

Hello Mark,
     My '86 has a &quot;lumpy idle&quot;  It does'nt seem as bad as yours.  You can't
feel it when inside the van.  If you listen to the exhaust, it sounds like
it has a very radical cam profile.  At times it smooths out then back to
loping.  I've checked the idle stabilizer and it seems to be working.  I
assumed that the idle was normal.

baffle them with bull sh*t.
