Subject: Phoenix College Event Report!

 The Phoenix College Arizona Volkswagen Club~ St. Mary's Charity event held
yesterday, (Sunday, 3/17/96)  was the WORST attended  event I have ever
attended. I was in attendance at 05:30-10:00 and saw literally almost
nothing that was of value to the average V-Dub fan.  Very few attendees and
sellers. Compared to other years the show was about a fourth to a half.  As
recently as two years ago the event was buzzing elbow to elbow by 06:30.
Yesterday, the car show was sparse with a handful of vehicles (some really
nice) but only one bus as of 10 AM.  The '68 Double cab  happened to be
owned by SWATO President Kent Thorpe and looked pretty darned nice!
Congratulations Kent!
Rusty thought that he could have pushed the half wired / non motored '67
Westy Resto shell to the show and took &quot;Best Camper.&quot; ;)
