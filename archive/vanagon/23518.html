As stated earlier in this  discusion; just step into your car and put on
some heavy electric users, the idling speed will drop, sometimes you will
even HEAR that the fanbelt has to put up with increased stress.
(all this assuming that you don't have a Jap car that adjusts it's own
idling speed whenever neccessary)
So this PROVES that it will use HP.

The battery becomes a electric user as soon as the alternator or generator
starts doing it's work, just as for instance your ignition system, the
battery is only a source of electricity when the Alt/Gen isn't working,
Primairily (?spelling) for starting the engine.
So when the battery becomes empty the engine should still run, if not the
At/Gen isn't doing it's job (obvious why the Battery is empty)
In some rare instances the battery can act as an extra buffer besides the
Alt/Gen, for instance a hefty booming system that draws hi-amp figures FAST,

Have a nice day :)  Brian
