Subject: Re: intermittent hard shifting q

In reference to Matt Goike's shifting problem&gt;

I had a similar problem with my shifting on my '80 Wanagon as well.  It was a
bitch finding first.  Then the tranny itself expired a few weeks back.  Found
another good used (82) Wanagon trans.  When I swapped them this week I found
that the Guide Pin and it's ring (See pg 34.2 in the Bentley) were shot.  The
Pin (probably thru years of use and abuse) had become slightly bent, thus not
allowing the rear shift rod and relay lever to operate as correctly as it
should.  So I replaced the Guide Pin, Guide Ring, Boot and for good measure
the Relay Lever when I finished putting the tranny in.  Shifts alot smoother
and is more &quot;positive&quot; in gear selection at the shifter now.  No more
hunting.

Hope this helps :)
