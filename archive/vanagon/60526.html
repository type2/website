Subject: Tranny noise normal?

I took my parents-in-law for a spin in our &quot;new&quot; '87 GL and my 
father-in-law commented on the transmission whining noise.  That 
planted a seed of worry in my head and now I'm wondering what the 
transmission is supposed to sound like.  

Also, what normal service can be done on the tranny; fluids, filters 
(if any), etc.?

Maybe I'll take Chris Turner on a spin with me since he's here in 
town (you out there, Chris?).

Regards,
