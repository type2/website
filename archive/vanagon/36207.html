&gt;Marchall's front of the lens was totally flat, as compared to the 
&gt;standard 'bulge' of others.  The light beam from the Marchall's was 
&gt;the best i've ever seen, much better than the Z-beam. 


I'll second this, my 7&quot; round Marchalls were superb, bright white light as 
far ahead as I needed, better than current square lights even with those 
'driving light' aux. beams. They were great, until some wino pounded one out 
with a beer bottle :(.
