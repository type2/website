Subject: interesting bus in Seattle

I saw a bus in Seattle yesterday that made me do a double-take:
a school bus with *2* transporters attached to the top - front-to-rear.
They had just cut the nose off of one, and the tail off the other, hooked them
together somehow, and the whole contraption was on top of the school bus.
I have no idea what it looked like inside.
