Subject: Dead Deer on a Syncro

Ahhh... Here in Pa, deer hunting season is upon us. I saw a wonderful sight as I
was traveling up towards the Poconos Mts. area yesterday.  It was a silver '86
or '87 mud covered syncro with a deer strapped to the Yakima type roorack. Was
this a fellow listmember??  Yes , there's nothin' like seeing a dead deer
hanging off a car, especially right before lunch.....    :&lt;)
