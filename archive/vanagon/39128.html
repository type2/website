Subject: Silver list sticker

	I've found that the silver sticker is sometimes nearly invisible
on the rear-window of my single-cab- the window is lightly tinted
(film inside) and the silvery sticker just sorta merges with the
general reflections... So I may peel it off and put another one on
the body somewhere- the silver *will* show up clearly against the
off-white body, I'm sure.
	Gotta say 'pass' on a likeness of Jerry, but its a
personal thing...

	Bill
