&gt;&gt;     I'll be going to the Cincinnati show on Saturday, and I'll post more 
&gt;&gt;pictures next week.

&gt;Whoa, wait a second.  What's that forest-green Vanagon Westie next to your
&gt;Dad's bus?  I know a certain Limbo guy who would kill for one of those!


     'Twas a Diesel too.  It belonged to a couple from Canada who drove 
down for the weekend and paid the $5 difference between parking and 
showing for a nice spot on the grass.  

     I'll see if my dad remembers their name.  The club might have their 
registration too.
