Subject: oil temps

Hello all,
Well, now that I have an operational oil temperature gauge, I'm wondering what
&quot;normal&quot; oil temps are and what an &quot;extreme&quot; oil temp would be.  Of course, I
know that that is dependent on a number of factors, including air temperature,
oil viscosity,  whether the road is hilly or not, phases of the moon, etc.  But,
those of you with air-cooled buses, what kinds of temps do you *normally* see?
On the interstate earlier today, driving 60 mph on mostly flat ground with a few
slight hills, I saw 210 and then a little past, but not much.  Is this OK?  Is
this too high?  It seems like the temp around town that the gauge finally stops
climbing at is about 200-205 or so, just shy of 210.  Any comments?

Just checking,
Sean
