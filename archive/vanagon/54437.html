 (Several people have E-mailed me for this information so I am forwarding it on)
&gt;Charles,
&gt;        Here are the instructions for this Vanagon fix. Unplug the Electrical
&gt;connection on the air flow meter. Pull the rubber boot back to expose the
&gt;wires going into the connector. Find wires #2 and #4 (the numbers are
&gt;either on the air flow box, or electrical connector). Simply knick them
&gt;with a sharp knife for a 1/2&quot; to expose the bare copper, then pull the bare
&gt;wire up and away from the insulation forming a loop between the bare wire
&gt;and the insulation. The capacitor needed is a 25 volt 22 microfarad
&gt;tantalum type (cost me .41 cents). Solder the + side to wire #4 and the
&gt;negative side to #2. wrap the bare wires in electrical tape, then slide the
&gt;boot back up over everything, this seals everything in well. This
&gt;information was made available to me through the many helpful Vanagon
&gt;people on the web.
&gt;
&gt;        Now for an update on my Vanagon with this fix. Today the tep is 20
&gt;degree
&gt;and very snowy (6&quot;-8&quot;). On my trip home from work (I commute 38 miles) the
&gt;van did stall momentarily but did start up right away and no problems after
&gt;that. I am contemplating putting a higher number microfarad capacitor in.
&gt;These little engine gremlins are so much fun!!
