&gt;&gt;This isn't true, actually.  When I moved here (in 1990), I was not required
&gt;&gt;to pay any fee for my 1987 Golf.  It may only be true for cars that emit
&gt;&gt;excessive pollutants.  (If this is the case, GOOD!  Polluters should be
&gt;&gt;fined.)
&gt;
&gt;        Actually, it is true. I was told so by DMV themselves. Most likely
&gt;your Golf was sold originally with CA emissions. It doesn't actually matter
&gt;*where* the car was originally sold, if it came with the CA emissions
&gt;sticker/package. And you can buy the CA emissions in any state, just in CA
&gt;you're requiered to have them.

Actually, the Steve Maher said the following:

&gt;You don't have to abandon your non-CA car when you move here... at

&gt;Environmental Fee or some such, but it goes into the same general fund
&gt;that traffic tickets and court fines go into. The gummint's way of
&gt;getting around the Constitutional ban on interstate tariffs, maybe.

The part that isn't true was Steve's (typical right-wing distortionist
grrrrr) comment that this was a government ploy to get around a ban on
interstate tariffs.  I bought my car in Massachusetts, and there was no $300
'tariff' placed on my car when I came to California.
