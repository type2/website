Yet another bbta has come and gone, and with it another thundering
hangover.  We departed milwaukee at 10:00 pm on friday night, arriving at
5:00  am in o'fallon.  Three hours later I was packing lunch for the
cruise, the cruise was made nice by having the vanagon with ac.  Got back
to the campground and began mixing.  Almost won the hard luck trophy with
my story about buying $4.99 gin.  Did win a second place for our camping
area, the one with the Elvis painting, and the shag carpet.  Recovered
sunday, and had a nice drive back monday.  Hope to see you all in the
spring

ps Sorry I wasn't more social, between my son and the dog, i stayed close
to home most of the weekend
