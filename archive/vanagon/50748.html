Subject: VW CD's - Correction, please read!
Date: Tue, 22 Oct 1996 09:41:17 -0700 (PDT)
From: &quot;Turbo&quot; &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;

A listmember posted incorrectly yesterday that Alldata was considering
publishing these CD's.  That isn't correct, and he re-posted to that
effect.

The problem is a bunch of people have emailed in asking for them
like they are a done-deal, which isn't true.  So now the marketing
guy is giving me the deer-in-the-headlights look like &quot;what is this?&quot;

I'm basically only trying to show the powers-that-be that there is
indeed interest in the product.  I can't and haven't promised 
anything.  

I apologise for any misunderstandings

Again, for the whole story, check out:
