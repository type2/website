&gt; Can anyone elaborate for me on the relationship between Jack Kerouac
&gt; and VW busses?

Well, Jack did have a thing for Mexican women.  In fact, so did 
William S. Boroughs, it almost got him a life sentence once, or 
something like that.  As for Jack, I can't say.  Maybe he drove one 
when he was in Mexico.  In _On The Road_ he always preferred some huge 
american land barge.  There is a lot of room in there for the women and
the booze while you are racing across the country.  Oh, and don't 
forget the benies.  Also, you need a really great stereo playing Miles
Davis and you have to go Yas Yas Yas every so often, but I digress.  I 
do have a friend who has read most everything he ever wrote, I will ask
and get back.  Jim
