Subject: Re: Red Rock and Syncro adventure

&gt;Aaaaaaggghhhh!!!!  No other Syncros are going?  I was really looking forward
&gt;to doing a little off-roading with another Syncro or two.  Come on Syncro

Guess who's driving the rescue vehicle :)  Got a nice long tow strap? I'd
love to try some desert bashing, nothing here, just a sea of mud and water
on my favorite drives. Tim

'87 Sync-in-hole Westy

Off road driving tip #307: when stuck in mud do NOT stick your head out the
window and look down to see which front wheel is spinning.:O  'nuff said.
