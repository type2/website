&gt;        I have experienced excessive wear on the inside of the tread
&gt;on both rear wheels.  I had +40K miles on the tires. I tried to adjust
&gt;the camber to the correct values, but the adjustment 'bottomed out'
&gt;before the correct camber was achieved.
&gt;
&gt;        I was led to believe the coil springs have weakened over time, 
&gt;and this produces an increasing negative camber to the rear wheels.
&gt;The pivot axis for the trailing rear wheels is not perpendicular to the 
&gt;longitudinal axis of  the vehicle, so when the coils begin to sag, the 
&gt;camber just becomes more negative with time.
&gt;
&gt;        What I need to do, and probably you too, is to replace the coil
&gt;springs.  New ones will undoubtedly be a fortune from VW.  Is there
&gt;any point in looking for used ones at the auto wreckers, or is it very
&gt;likely, they will have as much sag as my current ones? Does any
&gt;one know of a manufacturer that has a generic coil spring that will
&gt;do the job?

Might be worth a try to install a set of gas pressure shocks - I put on
Bilsteins ~80k miles ago &amp; the bus is still riding over 1&quot; higher than stock
(raised it about 2&quot; initially - about the same as a Synchro);  the
pressurized gas acts as a spring, of course.
