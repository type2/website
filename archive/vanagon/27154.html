&gt; &gt;Whoooeeee!  Magnetic bumper stickers!  What a great idea.  Where would I get

&gt; I got one of theses for the Westy at our last show, but the adhesive kind,
&gt; not magnetic.  Where are the magnetic ones?

How about next time stick the adhesive sticker to a thin magnetic sheet
and trim off the excess?
