Subject: Need VALUE OF TENT, no poles

I've come across a used maybe 3-4 times (gorgeous no holes nice 
weatherstripping) VW tent for the late Bus.  The yellow, blue, red, 
etc. etc.  Thing is it comes with a Bus (does not scare me, will 
sell) but has no poles.  Any thought on the value of the tent in such 
condition and any chance I'll ever find poles?  If not I will still 
buy it and I'll bend/weld my own out of steel or aluminum conduit, 
but I'd love someone to tell me they got a set.
