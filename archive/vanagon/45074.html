Subject: RE:Eurovans to buy or not to buy

        The Eurovan weekender pkg is not the same as a full Westphalia. 
You get the pop top, table, bed, and a little icebox under the seat.  My
take on why VW only imported 93's is twofold.  1.  Cost-24K list for a new
one was pretty steep for what you got.  2.  VWoA was behind in their
marketing and got their butt kicked by the Us minivans.  In 95 VW imported
Winnebago full campers which looked good but were 32K MSRP.  We can only
hope that VWoA gets their act together and gets us what is available in the
rest of the world.  I'm not holding my breath but can only hope.
        I have a 93MV (Bed and table) and love it. Wish I had the $ for a
camper now. The Eurovan is rather gutless but what VW van isn't.  The great
thing is that there is really space on the inside.  I have yet to see real
space in a US minivan.
        Before I forget I'm a new member and dig the list.  Currently have
the EV, 90 Fox wagon, and 74 Superbeetle.  In my past lives I've had a 71
bus and 82 Vanagon.
