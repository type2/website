Subject:      95 EV CAMPER TIRES

I have a 95 EV Camper.  At 10,000 miles, a thumping began in the rear.
I noticed irregular tire wear.  Took it to an alignment specialist and
they said the rear end was within VW specs.  I have rotated tires
every 5 to 7 thousand miles, and with 26,000 miles on tires, the noise
and irregular wear is as bad as ever. If anyone has any suggestions, I
would be obliged.  Also, if anyone knows of a replacement tire other
than the Goodyear G 64, please let me know. Finally, the clutch
shudders aa I engage into first gear or reverse. It doesn't seem to do
it all the time.  Any ideas?  Thanks,  Richard in Boulder.
