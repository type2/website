Ok, I think I figured it out.

I got a good range of ideas, ranging from whacking the carb to 
cleaning the heat riser to offering a burnt chicken as sacrifice
to Hoolovoo, the superintelligent shade of blue.

My suspicion was still that it was the governor.  It only id the
do if I ran into the governer in 3rd gear.  After doing that, 4th gear
would be sluggish.

Tonight, before I left the office, I tightened the guv a couple twists,
making it kick in later.  That seemed to fix the problem.
