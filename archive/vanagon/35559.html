&gt; Is there someone out there in listland that could give me an idea of the 
&gt; changes/differences between Digifant and Digijet?
&gt;
&gt;

Basic differences to confuse all:
Digijet is used on all 1.9L Vanagons.  It incorparates a Lambda sensor (O2)
system and it uses digital controls to operate fuel mixture charecteristics.
 It is really a digital version of the Air Flow control system used since the
75 model year.  Idle stabilazation is done with an add on idle stabilizer
added to the ignition system.  This circuit advances the timing when engine
speed dros below 900 rpm.

The digifant is refereed to as Motronic in other cars.  The O2 sensor is now
heated for faster response and the ignition timing is now controlled by the
ECU.  In fact the ignition module is in the brain.  Idle stabilization is
done with a throttle bypass that is controlled by a separate box located
behind the right side tail light.  This syetm provides superior engine
management although it is much more sensitive to any electrical problems.
 Any sensor or ground connections that glitch will cause the ECU to go into a
Limp mode that will cause all types of grief.  Esecially important is the O2
and temparature sensors.  These and poor grounds are the cause of 95% or
better of these vehicles problems.
Hope this helps,
Dennis.
