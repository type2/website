Subject: List of stuff for sale in Vallejo

I have a set of Bergs HD single springs.  I even have a set of double
springs.  Both used, with HD retainers &amp; keepers.  The singles would still
be running except that I think I failed to clean the guide well after I
lapped the valves by hand so there was some grinding compound left in the
guide.  The guide was toast after a couple thousand miles, but the springs
should all still be good.

I paid like $75 for the single manifolds, I've been trying to get 66% of
cost for my used stuff.

Used long-block with broken rings? (Burns oil badly) $250.00
AS41 Case has been overheated (300+ deg.) several times, is line-bored .020
oversize mains, cylinder holes are bored for 90.5/92 P&amp;C sets, oil galleries
opened, (RIMCO case) full flow fittings, 10 mm studs.
69 mm Berg welded CW crank and lightweight flywheel (12v, 200mm) have
excessive run-out and are 8 dowelled 3/8&quot; because of previous mistake with
the flywheel coming loose. Use at your own risk.
Crank is at least .010&quot; under on both rods &amp; mains.  Has HD gland nut &amp;
washer. Clutch &amp; PP OK, but chatter some because of the run-out.
Heads are factory dual port, new less than 2000 miles ago, bored for 90.5/92
cylinders.
Stock cam &amp; lifters were good. Stock rockers.
Deep sump included.  30mm Melling oil pump blows most filters to pieces.
Even if you fix it, it should never be driven hard.  Not for a Bus unless
very gently driven.
Basically the story is this was my main engine and I drove it very hard  in
a '71 squareback, then a '63 bus (melted heat exchangers! because of a
restrictive fuel pressure regulator) until I broke a 40mm exhaust valve on
an SE head with dual springs.  I put new P/C's and heads on it only to
forget to tighten the gland nut because I had loosened it to open up the
short block, but didn't and..... drove 25 miles, banged out the dowel holes,
got sick of myself, let it sit around for two years in storage, revived it
by drilling out the holes and fitting 3/8's dowels, drove it for about a
thousand miles (ran pretty well) until a bad oil burning problem developed.
Must've rusted the cylinders in storage and broken a ring (theory).  Pulled
engine, gave up, FOR SALE!  Price is right for the heads alone.

Other stuff for sale;

Set of Berg steel pushrods, stock length
Box of distributors
Box of oil pumps
Box fuel pumps
Box of camshafts (one dual lift screamer)
Box of lifters
early 40 hp fanhouse

More stuff sitting in storage I can't even remember but will bring.
