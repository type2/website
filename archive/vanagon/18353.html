Subject: Re: help with carb!

&gt;I have a 1600 with a Solex 34 PICT-3 (I think). Anyway the engine runs rich
&gt;as indicated by carbon on the new plugs. It misses in all gears and there is
&gt;evidence of gas leaking around and from the carb. What should I do? How hard
&gt;is a rebuild? I just fully tuned it except for new plug wires - #1 wire is 
&gt;getting burned through from the manifold. 
&gt;
&gt;mucho TIA

Float valve loose or not closing?  (St. Muir.)  Fuel pressure too high?
Pushrod doesn't match pump?  Main jet loose in the carb?  Burned wires?  Bad
scene, too hot, many things happening here, watch out.
