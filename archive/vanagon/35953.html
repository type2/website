Subject: Re: Need auto-stop propane tank valve

&gt;I understand that when the tank is full overflow propane is supposed to
&gt;come out there when the tank is more than 80% full. Is that right? 
&gt;Nothing comes out of mine. 


  It sounds like you just need a new bleed valve maybe... My filling
valve is cracked, making it impossible to even attempt filling it. I'd
like to get a regular RV valve put on there if possible. I'd like to
give it a try myself, but I don't really have access to tools right
now (I'm lucky to find a %$#_at_ parking spot here in T.O.) and I think
that I'd rather stick to maintenance procedures with less potential
for explosion for now...

  BTW, does anybody know if NAFTA covers VW parts yet? I just want to
know what I'm going to get nailed for if I try to order parts from
the U.S..
