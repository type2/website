Subject:      Re: Anchor bolts in an '84 Westfalia

Also, can't you test for a fixed-thread arrangement by unscrewing it
 partway and trying to jiggle it?  If it won't jiggle, then the nut is
 welded or the threads are somehow secure, right?

Seats are

 &gt; &gt; I'm tempted to extract one of these bolts, insert an anchor hook
that I can
 &gt; &gt; tether my child's carseat to, and then reinsert the bolt.  Looking
 &gt; &gt; underneath the camper I don't see any bolts coming through the
floor
 &gt; &gt; near where these ones go in.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; If I remove the bolt will I be able to easily put it back in?  Or
will I hear the
 &gt; &gt; sound of a nut falling away into the depths and then end up with a
loose
 &gt; &gt; rear seat?    Will I need a longer replacement bolt (the anchor is
about a
 &gt; &gt; computer diskette in thickness)?
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; Your help would be appreciated.

 &gt; &gt; B.T.W. - Volkswagen of Canada/America told me over the phone that
 &gt; &gt; '84's were not designed for the extra tether of a Canadian
carseat.  They
 &gt; &gt; also would not recommend a workaround because they didn't want to
be
 &gt; &gt; held liable.
