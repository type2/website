&gt; &quot;So what&quot;  you say?  Well, if you bunch blue, green and red  LEDs together
and
&gt; they are reasonably matched in output you get WHITE light!!!  In fact I
&gt; remember that was pointed out in the article as an option.  Now if I could
&gt; remember WHO manufactured this  . . . .

Harvey:

It's been a while, and I'm certainly no electrician (geologist), but I seem
to remember my 80 Vanagon had a blue LED for the brights indicator.  Am I
dreaming?

 Tim:

 It seems to be a blue LED, but in fact, it is a little regular bulb with a 
filter only passing the blue light spectrum. If you still own your '80 
Vanagon, the filter is going bad and the white light will pass through.
