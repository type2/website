Subject:      79 kombi

would whoever sent me a message about having a 79 kombi
please re-send. i've managed to lose/misplace/delete/trample upon wherever
it was that i stored/printed it.

and are you sure it's a real kombi? with pretty sparse interior? i didn't
think they were still selling Kombi's over here in 79.

thanks
joel

p.s.
anybody else that has joined up and would like to add their bus to the
'collection', please send me who-you-are and what-you-got. thanks.
