Subject: WTB: diesel Vanagon or Westy
From: chawk_at_juno_dot_com (j g shepard)

I like my wife's 88 Wolfsburg so much I want a Vanagon of my own. If
anybody has any leads let me know.
Has anybody used one of those CD-ROM phone directories? If you have let
me know. I need a phone number crossed to a name. Thanks.
Justin
