Subject: North East Camp-out/get together.


Okay Folks,
GNATT is over. All the west-coast westie folks are talkin about it.
Hell, they're even talkin' 'bout Bardley's wrestling match in prune
flavored Jello with Martha's flannel computer...

Well?
Should those of us in Southern Ontario/Western New York/Eastern Michigan
get together for a camp-out?

This weekend I visited a great campground on the North side of Lake Erie
called Turkey Point (Gobble Gobble).  I camped there with my family as
a kid, and it looks like it's just as nice now as it was then.
It's two hours from Toronto and Buffalo, about three from Detroit...
you know, accessable.  Maybe 7 hours from Ottawa... And a lot more fun
than a pizza night.

They've got real crappers and showers for those of us who might care,
trailer dumping ststions for all 0 of us with Rialtas, cool trails
for walking/running/hiking/biking.

Group camping areas so that we could congregate in our own little
area away from those horrible types who might complaine about a bunch
of weirdos with rusty, broken down, old, noisy Volkswagen Vans.

There's also a playground with all sorts of fun stuff for you and/or
your children to play on.

There's a golf course right nearby... But count me out.

There's a little auto shop 10 minutes away that always has a handfull
of VWs parked out front, for those of you who don't know if your
ride is up for the round trip.

I think that it would be great fun for us Great Lakes area lenti folks
to get together.  I have lots of info on Turkey Point Provincial
Park (Gobble gobble), if you're interested let me know.

Come on folks.  Lets get it together.


Cheers
