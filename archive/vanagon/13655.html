Maybe someone out there has some advice.....

I have a '71 bus (with vacuum assisted brakes).  The bus idles fine, but when
I apply the brakes the idle becomes very rough and sometimes stalls.  This
happened once before when I accidently disconnected a vacuum fitting.  I
can't find a leak, but I still suspect this is part of the problem.  Does
anyone know the vacuum that a 1600cc engine should be pulling at idle, and
with the brakes on?  This info or other advice would be appreciated.
