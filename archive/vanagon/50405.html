Subject: Looking at 87 Vanagon: Feedback Please

I am an old air-cooled VW-Head who is looking at a wasserboxer for the 
first time and would appreciate some feedback. The Vanagon is 1987 and 
presents in excellent cosmetic shape. Of note:
1 138K miles, approx 20K since new motor 
2 Original Auto trans
3 A/C works great (I am in Houston area)
This truck is at one of the few VW independent shops here in the Houston 
area, owner bought it from owner who did not want to invest any more $$ 
into the van for it needed inner/outer cv joints. It runs great, I worry 
however about the tranny, how much longer before rebuild on average? And 
the engine, if it is the Canadian VW rebuild, I have heard numerous 
probs concerning these rebuilds from VW Canada. The shop wants $5400 and 
I feel he might accept between $4000 and $4500. This will be my wifes 
car (hence the happiness with the auto).
Again the vanagon looks great cosmetically, orig paint and all, not a 
scratch. Any and all feedback appreciated by Vanagon afficianados.
Regards
Mark B. Magee
