Subject: Re: FW: SA Rear windows- hey, they open!

I just checked on this at the VW dealer in Fargo, ND and they show a rear
sliding window in natural aluminum color.  I stoped checking on it when
I found the price was $650 retail.  If the right rear window would have
been available I may have checked into it further. I have a Westy which
the rear cabinet would make it difficult to open and close a rear slider
on the left side.

&gt;Looking at this image of the South African Vanagon,  I see the rear most
&gt;windows are sliders, not solid.  Does anyone know if these are
&gt;available?  Same window opening in body?
&gt;
&gt;Also, Just so no one gets too excited, these are right hand drive.
