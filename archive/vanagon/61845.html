This post is tangentially VW related, in that I'm looking for a tool that I
will use to work on my VW.

The subject is breaker bars.  I went to the Craftsman store today and
oooh-ed and aaaah-ed over all the nice stuff (like torque wrenches --
that's my birthday present :-).  I bought a set of 1/4&quot; drive extensions
(with the little screwdriver type thing that attaches to the 1/4&quot; drivers),
a 1/2&quot; drive to 3/8&quot; drive adapter, so when I need more leverage on those
smaller fasteners I can break out the big ol' 1/2&quot; drive ratchet, and a set
of feeler gauges.  I need the feeler gauges because the set I currently
have doesn't go low enough to do the valve adjustment on the Karmann Ghia. 
Now I've got a nice 36-blade set that does the job w/ no problem.

What I really want is a breaker bar.  Craftsman sells a &quot;flex handle&quot; type
of bar in 1/2&quot; drive that has a pivoting head.  While that's a nice touch,
I tend to think that the pivot in the head is the weak point of the entire
bar.  What they have that I want is a &quot;slide bar&quot; type deal, where the head
can slide the length of the bar, so you can use it as a straight breaker
bar or you can slide the head to the middle and use it like a cross-type
tire iron, or anywhere in between.  And it also seems that it would be
stronger.  However, the problem is that Craftsman only apparently makes it
in 3/4&quot; drive, which I don't want.  They do have a smaller one in 1/2&quot;
drive but it's really too small to be useful, even smaller than my 1/2&quot;
drive ratchet.  

So what I'm wondering is if anyone knows of a good source for a quality
version of this tool.  I don't want one that's going to break on me.  I saw
one for sale at the swap meet during the Circle Yer Wagons show for $20 and
I should have bought it.  

I know Sonny Flamer (on the Vanagon list) has a really nice really LONG
breaker bar similar to this (I can't remember if it's the slide or flex
type).  Sonny, where did you get that puppy?

Thanks all, and please send all replies directly to me so as not to clog
the list with this.

Sean
