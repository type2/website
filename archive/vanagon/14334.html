Subject: '80 Van won't start (sometimes)


A request for opinions from a newbie. We have recently acquired a '80
Westphalia. We were told that the starter had been replaced due to 
starting problems in '93 and a new battery installed the same spring.

After four hours of highway driving we pulled off for lunch. The van had
started no prob that morning. There had been negligible current drain while
driving (i.e., no headlights, etc.) and the water pump was used sparingly
at lunch. After lunch - no start. The solenoid &quot;clicks&quot; but no start. The
local town service station came and boosted us for a start and checked the
battery (nearly fully charged) and the alternator (good output). I checked
the automatic transmission neutral safety switch on the selector - no prob.

So what gives? This happened a second time on the trip - fortunately after
refuelling - the booster was right there and free. Is this a case for Muir's
&quot;By-pass solenoid&quot;?

All info, opinions and myths gratefully received.

Bruce
