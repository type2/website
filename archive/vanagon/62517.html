Subject: Fiberglass body parts, anyone?
Date: Wed, 9 Jul 1997 08:40:21 -0500

All, 
In response to a post that I came across the other day concerning
fiberglass, I talked with my SO's brother, who is in the business. He makes
custom body parts for mostly larger trucks and busses (Thompson, Blue
Bird,...) He said that it would be very simple to make most of the side
panels. All we need is a donor part for each one to make a pattern from.
Sounded like a very worthwhile adventure, we can make the pattern in my
garage and maybe even make the parts there until the neighbors catch on. Is
there enough of you guys out there that would be interested to make it a
worthwhile project? We could possibly even get his employer to pick up the
tab for the pattern and offer the parts to the list. It would sure be nice
to not have to worry about all that seam rust that we all get. If someone
out there has undamaged steel parts for tooling, we could work a deal on
the fiberglass counterparts. Also does anyone know what, if any legal
problems could be involved? I've been told that you have to change the copy
a certain percentage to avoid patent rights, but I would think that a total
material change would qualify. Anyone ?????
