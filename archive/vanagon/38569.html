Subject: Radial tire size for '70 Bus?


I have a 1970 Westfalia bus, and I want to buy some new radials for it.
It had 195 70R 14s, but the speedometer read about 7mph fast.  I'm 
assuming that I need a larger size.  The factory recommendation was only
for bias ply--7.00 x 14.  Does anyone know the right radial size for this
bus?  Thanks
