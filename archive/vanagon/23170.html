Subject: Re: westy table


&gt;&gt;&gt; If its the kind that folds up on hinges like in my '71 campmobile, I 
sold
&gt;&gt;&gt; one for $20.00, and have another for $20.00 that I will ship cod to
&gt;&gt;&gt; whoever wants it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just cause they want a cheap table... You're gonna send them fish?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cod is in short supply, try either halibut or turbot.....&gt;


When is the first table-taco expedition?
