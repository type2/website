&gt;Unit Weight:      approx 170 lbs. (may be a big factor for boats)

&gt;The price sheet is from 1992:  # 60 KP storburn toilet....2150.00 (US).


AAAAIIIIIYYYY!!!!!

One of these things would convert my Bus into a monstrous toilet on wheels!
It would take up a lot of the floor space, be heavy, and make me go broke!
But at least I could take an emergency dump anytime if I wanted to...
