Subject: Re: Wolfram Grey Metallic

&gt;Anyone on the list with Wolfram Grey Metallic paint, such as would come on a
&gt;late model Vanagon. I have paint for this you can have cheap!

Derek, got a paint code for this stuff, my '87 is a light silver grey, is 
this Wolfram? I'll check for its code # tomorrow. Body seams need fixing up!
