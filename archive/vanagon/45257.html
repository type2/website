Subject: Drop-sides for '67 Splittie Pick-up needed

Hi there,

I live in the UK, and am trying to source out a set of drop-sides and
tail-gate for my '67 pick-up.  Do you have any ideas where I can obtian some?
 Particularly on the west coast, as I have a friend living in San Jose.

I am prepared obviously to pay the shipping.

Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,

Gareth Kendall
