&gt;to verify results.  Anyone care to predict what will happen?

well, you may be able to pressurize the carbs enough to blow the gas out
onto the engine, or at least upset the float levels.  How many CFM does your
engine want, compared to what that fan will push? lets see, 3600RPM/4=900
intakes /min, at 121cu in/intake ideally, 100 for ease is 90,000cu in/min /
1728cuin/cuft. we're over 50cfm, barring math errors.  Busy little fan, but
may just do it...? Any less and the engine's going to be driving the fan!
Hey free electricity!
