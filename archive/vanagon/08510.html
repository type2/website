Subject: Re: Re: Transporter Badges?

&gt;Well I'd go down to the scrapyard and pick up a handfull off the ground :-) 
&gt;Seriously, there is a place near my parents house that has dozens of 
&gt;transporters, I'll have a look next time I'm up there and get as many as I 
&gt;can stuff in my pockets.

The last message from me (the one starting out &quot;By all means...&quot;
was supposed to have the above quote present so
y'all would know what the hell I was talking about.  Sorry...
It's a grey, foggy morning, and there's grey fog in my head.
More coffee, please.
