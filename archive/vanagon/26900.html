Subject: Re: A little [W]ednesday humor to brighten your week!

I drive a Toyota Starlet now (sorry to admit it!!!) and it goes fast on 
the freeway.  I'm not defending passing on the right mind you.  But, I 
speed on long trips in order to maintain my alterness.  I don't want a 
ticket, so my field of vision extends a half mile behind and in front of 
me.  I try to sidle behind trucks when approaching them, or in front of 
them when pulling away.  Sometimes the big picture says &quot;pass on the 
right&quot;, especially when someone is tooling along in the middle lane.  
Again, I'm not defending my actions.  They are ethically wrong and I 
apologize to all the slowpokes young and old I might have offended and 
raised the anxiety of.  I'm sorry...

&gt; On the trip down there, on Hwy 80, going about 70 in the middle lane,
&gt; several people would zoom up from behind in the #1 lane, slide over 2 lanes, 
&gt; pass me, and then zoom back to the #1 lane.

&gt; C'mon - be a MAN - pass on the LEFT!
