&gt;From Chicago....

It's late here so while reading the autosection of the paper to see if I 
could have waited another week
before i popped for my vanagon, I came across these:

'72 Bus, perfect Blue/White tan interior, everything new, CD Player $6,500 
OBO 708-349-1219

'73 Bus, mint Orange/tan $4,000 OBO 708-349-1219

'84 VW Camper. Good Condition, nearly perfect mechanically. Sony Soundstream 
stereo.
    extremely reliable, water cooled engine, 4 speed ac 312-772-1192

'77 VW Bus Runs great, good tires, solid body. $1,400 312-486-6764

As an idea, maybe a Web page set up to list Bus/Vanagon, etc. prices listed 
by date? Any feedback?
