&gt; &gt;Am I the only one that has noticed david BLACK and mike WHITE on the VW
&gt; &gt;list? Do we have any Grey, Brown, Green, or textures like Tweed? Sorry to
&gt; &gt;take the band width with a post like this but hey, my productivity stats
&gt; &gt;were just too good and I my mind was all tired out from thinking of
&gt; &gt;important posts like camping toys and showers.

In Southwestern Hindi, Walker means &quot;Turquoise&quot;.

In Northwestern Oregon, Poulson means &quot;Eggnog&quot;.

Any other color commentary?
