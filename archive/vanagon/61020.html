Subject: Anybody seen STEVE DOLAN?

Just wondering if anybody has seen the wondering Jew?

I still have a real bad feeling about the fact we put the front axle 
beam on his van a whopping 4 days before he decided to drive it out 
on his 6 week cross country trip.  Anyway he should have made CA by 
now and still no reports.

Anybody see him?  Hope he's doing OK out there.
