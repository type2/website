&gt;OK, although I still doubt that the teflon tape is preventing a good

It would be a good test, although the 6 inch nipple from the hardware
store will probably start to leak oil... 

&gt;&gt; VDO also sells a few adapters. T's, flex hose (I believe); will look it up
&gt;&gt; and let you know.

&gt;Great, thanks.  We all might like the info. on how to get a VDO catalog.

OK, you can order your own catalog by calling VDO at (703) 665-0100.

For type IV engines and air-cooled vanagons, VDO sells an adapter plate
for the &quot;oil drain&quot; plug. Part # 240 827, listed at $33. This is not the
part BusBoy Jim referred to in an earlier post; I saw the part he referred
to as being only for all *other* air-cooled engines (bug, pre-71 bus, type
3). (Jim, correct me if I'm wrong.)

A flexible hose adapter for the pressure sender is available for type IV
engines. Part # 150 752, listed at $20.50.

Finally, a T-adapter, VW male M10 by 1, is listed at $10.50, part # 240 850. 

My price list is from last year and may be outdated.
