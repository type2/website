Subject: Re: Stats and glow plugs. 


&gt;From P.J.Kenny
&amp;&amp;Well, I haven't a *clue* what a glow plug looks like - or where
&amp;&amp;the lil' critters reside in the engine bay.  My friend said
&amp;&amp;that a plug costs around fifteen pounds apiece and that I may
&amp;&amp;have to replace only the faulty ones.

I paid approx. us$13 for each of the &quot;fast&quot; plugs--see, there are fast &amp; 
slow, recognizable by the color of the ring--this can be seen from the 
outside, it's right where the &quot;glow plug bus bar&quot; connects to the glow 
plug.  (Bentley sez:  replace 'em at 60K (mi))Fast=silver; Slow=brass.
The FLAPS/FLARS said no price diff, so I bought fast ones.
(Then I discovered that my glow plug in-line fuse was the 
problem--located underneath a little plastic cover; directly in-line 
with the large red wire which gives power to &quot;glow plug bus bar&quot;).

The glow plug slightly resembles a spark plug from the outside; the 
inside part is a small (2-3cm) carbon tip, which when power is applied, 
glows.  

You'll find your glow plugs directly underneath the injectors, which you 
(or the mechanic) must remove to access them.  (Bentley sez:  get new 
injector heat shields when removing/reinstalling injectors)  

I temporarily obviated the problem by plugging in my block heater; yet 
after spending $50+ and realizing I only needed to spend $0.70...sheesh! 
(at least I now have 'em!)
