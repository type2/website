David---Safare Camper

Sounds like one for you!!!

You should give him the full lowdown on yours....this doesn't sound bad for
the price..extra motor and all.

&gt;Hello folks,
&gt;
&gt;I think I may be on the verge of fulfilling a 10 yr. dream - 
&gt;getting a VW camper.  But first, I figured I'd better bounce
&gt;some things off the friendly people on this list.
&gt;
&gt;Here's what I know about the bus so far:
&gt;
&gt;1974 Custom Safare (non-poptop camper)
&gt;
&gt;Current owner (3rd) reports:
&gt;
&gt;- Originally a California vehicle, moved to Ohio, then to NY
&gt;- Current engine has 32K miles on it
&gt;- &quot;compression is excellent - all cylinders between 140 &amp; 150&quot;
&gt;- Minor rust around windows, repaired
&gt;- Undercoating in good shape
&gt;- Mechanically sound
&gt;- 90% to 95% restored, according to him
&gt;- Has been ordered by parental unit to sell some vehicles or move out
&gt;
&gt;Asking price is $2,000, includes spare doors and motor.
&gt;
&gt;Now, details on me, the potential buyer:
&gt;
&gt;- Will be 1st time bus owner, 3rd time VW owner
&gt;- Zero experience on air-cooled engines, but generally fearless
&gt;- Looking to use this vehicle primarily for weekend getaways
&gt;- Unencumbered by potential spousal evil eye
&gt;- Clearly have a few screws loose
&gt;
&gt;So, whaddya y'all think?  Could this be the bus for me?  Is this
&gt;a fair price for this bus?  Everything else I've looked at in this
&gt;area (metro NY/NJ) is priced in the $5K and up category.  
&gt;
&gt;I would appreciate any comments, especially on specifics to look 
&gt;for when I go check it out on Saturday.  Responses via this list 
&gt;or private e-mail are all greatly appreciated.  I'll post the 
&gt;outcome of my visit if anyone is interested.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;
