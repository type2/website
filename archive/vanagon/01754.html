Subject: Window seals for '71 camper

I'm getting ready to order a windshield seal for my '71 Westfalia camper, and
I'm wondering what type to get.  It looks like you can get it with or without
a place for aluminum trim.  If memory serves, WCM calls the kind WITH the trim
stock or American or something, and the type WITHOUT Cal-look.  I'm trying to
keep most things stock, and the current windshield seal (as well as the hatch
seal, side window seals, etc.) is without the trim.  I was wondering what you
other '71 owners have:  with aluminum trim or without.  Thanks...
Pat Walsh, '71 Westy

P.S.  Considering the shape of the rest of the van, it's hard to believe the
previous owner went to the trouble of replacing all the seals, but ya never
know!
