Subject: Re: '87 low RPM/idle problems.

&gt;| If I nudge the RMPs up to 1200 or so (using gas pedal) RPMs repeatedly
&gt;| drift down, in cycles, every few seconds. This happens warm or cold. I
&gt;| think this makes initial acceleration through the low RPMs sluggish.

	Do you take your foot off the gas, or does it drift down while
yor foot is still on the pedal? If it drifts down while your foot is still
on the pedal, this all sounds like your throttle switch is out of
adjustment. See below. If your throttle switch does not click (take the
engine lid off so you can hear it) as soon as you apply ANY pressure to
the pedal, it is out of adjustment. It opening point is speced at .002 to
.004 inches of throttle movement measured between the throttle stop screw
and the plate that scew hits. To set it right, you need a set of feeler
guages, to set it near right, make the switch close as soon as pressure
is put on the throttle arm thingy (the piece the accelerator cable clamps
into) but with enough play so that when you pull the throttle arm out and
let it return, the switch closes. The right way to check this is with a
multimeter set to check resistance connected across the two pins in that
little white connector right behind (and behind means toward the back of
the car) the throttle housing itself. The not so right way, but will do in
a pinch way is just to use the clicking of the switch to determine when it
is open and closed (that is if yor switch clicks audibly)

&gt;| Other things: it may die repeatedly until warm (idles slower and rough
&gt;| when cold). In 2nd or 1st going very slow, with no gas pedal pressure, it
&gt;| sort of bucks and jump. Occasionally, it *will not* accelerate from a
&gt;| stop, major sluggisheness for 2-3 seconds, then it roughly gets going and
&gt;| is OK once I'm at the higher RPMs.
