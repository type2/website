Subject: Re: Time to upgrade...

Check the archives.  There are some great descriptions about the different
features for the model years.  I don't recall how far back they go, I seem to
recal it was around 84 or 85 last time I looked.

The major change was from 85 to 86 when VW went from the 1.9 to 2.1 engine.
 I would recommend purchasing one no older than 86 and the newer the better.
