Subject:      Re: '86Westy-2nd battery?&amp;need jack,curtain,washer

The Bus Depot carries the entire vent crank mechanism, as does Bus Boys. Both
have Web sites listed on Vanagon.Com vendors. I know it seems crazy to buy a
new assembly to replace a broken plastic washer - I machined new aluminum
parts for mine and pop-rivited in place. Should last longer than plastic. The
skylight also falls apart every few years from sunlight cracking. After
fiberglassing my second one a few times I finally got a replacement. (above
sources) They also carry the rubber seal - which is it likely needs by now. I
also replaced the entire pop-top seal, and suddenly people ask if I cot a new
car.

Ron Salmon at Bus Depot has these and other camper parts - sometimes used ones
- at good prices. Give him a call.

&gt;Also, wondering the best place/price for:
&gt;the jack
&gt;one missing section of curtain
&gt;a small white plastic washer-like item (one of 2) located at the end of
&gt;the cranking arm mechanism that lifts open a little ceiling vent in the
&gt;center of the pop-top.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions/resources appreciated.
