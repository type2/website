Subject: bike security alarm and/or lock.

My wife and I have three vehicles and three bikes, and no alarm system. I am
thinking that there might be a motion alarm that is transportable and with a
carry along pager thing that could even let me know if someone got too close
and I could use it on whatever vehicle I was using. I noticed at Bike Week in
Daytona there was this chain with square links and a strong lock for $85 but
the chain was short, and a longer one was too heavy. I thought a combination
of a motion alarm and a lock might just be all the security you could have
away from your home or hauling trailer. Thanks for some of your experience on
this subject of security for your bike. Bob in Orlando.
