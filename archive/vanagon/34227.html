&gt; My knowledge is nowhere near Hoover's, but I believe these engines
&gt; were the Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp. Turbocharged, 2800 cubic inches (!),
&gt; 2,000 horsepower each, driving a propellor at a whopping 900 rpm at cruise,
&gt; through a reduction gear assembly at the front.

This show had a great segment where the mechanics were assembling 
the gear reduction assembly on a tarp laid on the tundra.  After it 
was together they all started laughing and cheering.  My daughter (6 
years old) asked me, &quot;Why are those men laughing?&quot;  With visions of 
my own successes (and Tim Smith, wasserboxer head in hand and held 
high above his head, hooting as he turns in circles) I explained the 
immense joy and relief felt when a difficult situation is resolved.  
It is my hope as a father that she can know that same elation.... a 
safe bet if there still be VWs around  :)
