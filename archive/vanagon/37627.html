&gt; As I digress, Leo Carillo is on the P.C.H., that's Highway 1 folks! , 
&gt; just about 20 - 30 minutes south of Camarillo, which is just south of 
&gt; Ventura. Again, it's on the P.C.H. between Zuma beach and Camarillo.
&gt; Any q's? I'm a ready for you, and hopefully the campfire will be too...

So is anyone else going to this?  Or am I still on the shit list for sort
of backing out of Peppermint (or whatever it was)?  This looks like a nice 
one although the drive is a bit long.  When's the date again Jason?   
So who's up for this.  Obviously, I am?  Thom?  It's on the beach!  ;)
C'mon Joel, you'd look good in Bermuda shorts and spenders' :)
