--- Fact is when the engine is turned off, the pistons usually come to rest
all in the same position (roughly!) (ie- not at tdc or bdc) so when you
fire it up, the starter grabs the flywheel in one of 2 positions- whack
straight onto the
ring gear. Now if you move the flywheel 90', as I have done on a couple
of crap engines, you are effectively using a stronger and probably less
starter wearing part of the flywheel.---

** When I read this it got me thinking, he has a point.  I had a 66 bus
with a 1641cc engine and a degree wheel pulley.  I used to noticed that
when I turn off the engine it would come to rest a about the same point
everytime.   Same thing in my bug too.  So whats my point?  Well none
really, just backing up Aaron's point about the starter hitting the
flywheel at roughly the same points.  Just my to marks worth.  Take care.
