&gt;I also found (last time I did this) - that when I adjusted the valves as per
&gt;instructions, that the valve was lifted from its seat - no compression on
&gt;cylinder 1.  No one has been able to explain this behaviour - so I ended up
&gt;adjusting it only to remove any valve gap (as it was when I bought it) - and
&gt;have driven it for 5000 miles or so without incident.  
&gt;Can anyone explain this or give me some advice on setting these valves?
&gt;Thanks,    cheers

When adjusting valves properly, they will lift off thier seat.  You must wait
1/2 hour or so before starting engine to let lifters bleed down.  It is
normal for these lifters to ocaisionally loose thier prime.  The ticking
noise will usually go away after 20 minutes or so.  I find that running
engine for short time without allowing full warm up will often cuase a lifter
to bleed down and click on fiture startup.  I find this a common problem as I
often move Vanagons around the yard for access into the garage..
