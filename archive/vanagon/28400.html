    hi everyone,
 i talked to a local vw &quot;mechanic&quot; today and i don't know how we got on that
subject, but anyways: he says he routinely disconnects the thermostat in bus
engines (remember, that accordeon-looking thingie under the right lower
engine tin with the wire connection to the cooling air flaps in type IV's).
his reason was that if it ever fails (i.e., gets stuck in the &quot;cold&quot;
position) the engine fries. according to him, no damage is done if the flaps
are always in the open position (i.e., thermostat disconnected). is that
generally true or is it just because we have that REALLY mild climate here
on the oregon coast? any opinions out there ?
 ciao,

I find that the thermostat is a GOOD THING.   It makes the engine warm up
more quickly, reducing wear.  It also helps against carberettor icing,  which
happens in the just-above-freezing-and-very-wet-air climate of western
Washington winter.

I never have had  one stick open.   I have heard people worry about it.  I
recommend that you hook it up,  listen to your engine (you should anyway),
and look at the thermo stat every tune up.
