&gt;I couldn't disagree more.  I think that people who keep cars in museums
&gt;should get to live in the museums along with their cars.  One shouldn't
&gt;have to worry about driving a car around, or leaving it outside, unless
&gt;the weather is a danger to the condition of the car.  I doubt that was
&gt;the case here.  Cars are meant to be driven and appreciated, not stored 
&gt;in locked rooms.

Though it's tempting, given the general IDIOCY of the average non-classic
driver nowadays (lack of respect, tailgating etc.), to put your classic
under glass, I too think most all cars should be driven as much as is
possible, tough I fear as conditions in the cities get worse it'll become
more difficult to do this.  There are exceptions naturally -- like the
beautiful, showroom-condition 1935 (that's right) Mercedes/VW prototype that
you can visit at the Imperial Palace Auto Museum in Vegas.  Mercedes-style
steering wheel and dashboard, three headlights, suicide doors, single rear
tail-light, and an air-cooled rear-mounted engine that I was not able to
identify precisely. . .evidently an early &quot;tester&quot; for a People's Car before
VW got into production with it in '38.  Then again, talk about a &quot;head-turner&quot;!

'79 Bus (not a head-turner.)
