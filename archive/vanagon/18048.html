Subject: Hitches

Has anyone installed a trailer hitch on their van?  We tried calling 
around locally and were told that only extreme light duty( class 1 I 
think) are available because of the VW specs that the van can't be used 
for towing.  Has anyone gotten around this?  We are interested in towing 
a tent trailer now, but were thinking for the future, ie u-haul trailer, 
etc.  What types of hitches are being used and where are they obtained?  
Also is there any modifications required or welding to the frame?  Thanks!
