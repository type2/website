A Buncha people have voiced their opinions, about extra-list vehicles:

&gt;&gt; &gt; My dad just bought a '90 Vanagon camper, and later this month, he's
&gt;&gt; &gt; retiring to Washington State.  He doesn't read email, but sometimes I
&gt;&gt; &gt; post a question regarding his bus, so you might want to count it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well if you're gonna count that, you better count my mom's 94 Eurovan
&gt;&gt; Westfalia camper!  :)

&gt;Boy do I feel dumb.  My mom drives a late '70s Oldsmobile.  :(  I have
&gt;a friend with a Brown '85 or so Vanagon.  :)  Does that count?  Oh,
&gt;once my dad owned a bug.  For the life of him he can't figure
&gt;out why he sold it.

well ... admittedly this IS somewhat of a hideous obsession nowadays, but
i'm semi-trying to possibly keep track of only the buses that can be reached
via email. no particular reason, really ... it just kinda started that way
and stayed that way.  do you guys think i ought to keep non-listers on the
Grand and Glorious Dipwad Database?? &lt;it's starting to get kinda cumbersome
... a kludge to begin with, the 'free' ibm software isn't handling this many
names very well. gee. why am i not surprised? :)  &gt;

i would sort of rather NOT add the non-listers, but i don't have a really
good reason (except that i can't send them tech bulletins and recall notices
and such, when i get into Save The Buses mode). :)
