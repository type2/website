Subject: RE: Alloy wheel deal

&gt; You are right the off set will probably be different. VW and Audi put the
&gt; off set right on the wheels. I don't remember what letter they use but it
&gt; is the same as is shown in the parts film. 

Maybe not, I'm about 100% sure that early 5000 Turbo's use bus or 
vanagon front discs with ATE calipers on their rear wheels, 
indicating a similar hub/backspacing possibility.  It's easy enough, 
I'll call and find the offset of the Audi wheels, Germans cast it 
into all alloys as an ET number, ET38 fi is a 38mm offset.
Van wheel offset escapes me but will be easy enough to measure.  
Anything fairly close (within 10mm or so) is largely acceptable 
assuming that the wheel grows over the stock width evenly on both 
sides of the hub surface to prevent an increased bending moment 
loading one or the other bearing unevenly.
