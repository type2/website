Subject: Re: Eurobago VS Eurovan

I have already shared my grievances with Eurovan Winnebago owners, but a 
little repetition may be good for the soul...

Tomorrow I take the beast in for service, both scheduled and warranty, 
after our freshly-completed 9,000 km trip to Colorado and Utah.

My Beefs:

1.  That &amp;^%$$#^&amp; Norcold fridge.  Delivered with a DOA igniter in 1995. 
 Igniter (probably) has failed again.

2.  That *&amp;^^%^ Norcold fridge.  Won't operate on propane over 5,000 
feet.  Seems Winnebago omitted the high-altitude kit...

3.  That terrible paint.  Seems that VW's environmental consciousness 
exceeds their ability to formulate a decent water-based paint.  Little 
rust blooms all over.

4.  Those paper blinds.  Either their cords pop out of their holders, or 
 they get mashed by something.  The one on the sliding door is 
vulnerable to everything.  If they won't replace it, I'll make curtains.

5.  Upper bunk space.  The top doesn't go up enough.  I parked beside a 
Westy in Colorado - just as I remembered - the old top goes higher.  
Very tough for a 6-footer up there.  (My wife is convinced that 
Winnebago's underlying assumption is that the market is strictly retired 
couples who will never use the upper bunk.

6.  Storage.  Despite the enormous interior volume, there is less space 
for clothes etc than in our old Westy.  We have solved the problem with 
creative use of Rubbermaid (tm) boxes.  On this last trip, we also 
pulled a utility trailer (for the mountain bikes) and stored some stuff 
in there.


My Faves...

1.  The engine.  Great torque, great economy.

2.  The tranny.  I have the 5-speed.

3.  The cruise control - How did I ever live without it?

4.  The air conditioning - 105 F in Utah?  No problem.

5.  The three windows in the tent! (despite the low headroom).

6.  The tires (Goodyear G64) and the handling.

7.  That interior space - it's huge - I usually just stuff bikes inside 
rather than put on a rack.  I have put our tandem inside also.
