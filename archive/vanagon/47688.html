Subject: Previous FS homepage referral 

&quot;Nancy&quot; _at_ 31F7E9FA.4EE5_at_mail.aosi_dot_com posted a message a few days ago about
a great page of FS listings at http://acvwjyro_dot_com/GASS/ads/class.htm

I'd sure like to drool at the supposed delectable listing, too, but haven't
been able to connect with the page address as posted.  Is it correct?
Anybody else have any luck?
