Subject: Too quick to criticize???

Hi all, 

Perhaps everyone should slow down before they jump on this 
&quot;slam the vendor&quot; bandwagon.  There are good and bad guys 
out there, and it now seems that perhaps Kenneth Winter owes 
Ron Salmon an apology  for his recent post.  I'm just saying that 
everyone should slow down and check things out before you type 
something you might regret later.

Enough said, 

Bill Bowman
