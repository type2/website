So Ethan Wilson says:
&gt; 
&gt; After many a &quot;wanna syncro westy&quot; posting, I think that I've found one! A 
&gt; 91 with 21,000 miles... I have to sell my kids to get it....I'm most 
&gt; interested in comments about specifics to be checked out on the rig 
&gt; before purchase,  any comments?

You're worried about a Syncro with only 21K on it?  You better buy it
now before someone else snatches it out from under you.  I suppose you
could check for any possible radiator leaks, but I doubt you'll see
anything with that few miles.  The mechanicals should be fine unless
the person selling it to you is named 'Derek Drew'  ;)  

Just buy that Syncro, before it someone else grabs it.
