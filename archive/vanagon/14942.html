Subject: Unearthing 70 VW bus

A friend has a '70 VW bus that's been sitting in his driveway for
about 4 years without being touched. He wants to get it going, but
I cautioned him about the perils of old fluids, rust in cylinders,
flat spots on tires, etc. Some of the obvious problems it has:

1.) It won't move if you push it. I jacked up the rear wheels, they
both turn (trans in neutral, haven't tried to rotate engine by hand
yet). Jacked up the front, neither front wheel turns. My guess is,
rusty drums, shoes stuck to them. Any suggestions, other than Liquid
Wrench and a 2# hammer? I figure I'll have to replace all master &amp; 
wheel cylinders and shoes, and possibly drums too.

2.) I did turn the engine about 1/2 in. by hand. Seemed to move
fairly easily-- didn't try to turn it further, fearing rust/dirt in
one or more cylinders, although no overt evidence of same yet. I plan
to change oil, pull all 4 plugs, spray in Liquid Wrench, turn 1/4 turn,
more Liquid Wrench, 1/4 turn, etc., feeling for rough spots as I go.
If it seems to turn fairly smoothly, may next try to crank it with the
starter to get the oil flowing. After a minute of that, will let
starter cool, replace plugs, and try to start it. Any comments/
suggestions/screams of horror?

3.) It currently has the original type 30PICT-3 carb on a 1600 SP
engine. Assuming it gets going OK, He wants to put dual Kadrons on
this engine, with 009 and dual quiet-pack. Anybody have any experience
putting dual Kadrons on a single-port engine? Does this relieve
somewhat, the bottleneck caused by the long, narrow path from the 
Solex carb to those small, single ports? Do dual port heads have more of
a tendency to crack from the spark plug hole to the intake port, than
single-port heads when stressed?

4.) Anybody have a good source for rebuilding (or purchasing a newly
rebuilt) '70 bus steering box? 

5.) Anybody know where I can find a back seat (full length) for such a bus?

Thanks in advance,
