&gt; If past experiences are an indication, then 24 people signing up now
&gt; tends to mean that half that will actually make it to the trip.  We'll
&gt; see as time goes on.

I am a definate.  

&gt; We'll go with the flow on the campsites - if it's hot, I'll bet many
&gt; will prefer staying close to the cooler ocean if possible.  Safety will
&gt; be of concern, as well.  This can either be decided ahead of time, or
&gt; we can all even meet in one place in southern California, and go with
&gt; the flow where we feel as the wind takes us.  :)

I'll offer up my place as a meeting point.  I'm in San Diego, just about
20 miles north of the border.  Unfortunately, I'm in a condo, and while
there is guest parking, sleeping in the campers is probably not a good
idea.  I do have an extra room, a couch, and plenty of floor space.
I also have a shower - $5 for Martha, free for everyone else :)

&gt; As far as I'm concerned, anything is ok geographically, although considering
&gt; the number of days involved, and the fact that not everyone will be able
&gt; to make the first days and the last days (some only able to get away
&gt; for the weekend proper), maybe tending toward not going to deep into
&gt; Mexico is a good idea.

I'm in agreement with this.  I think we should go for high turnout
(safety in numbers!) rather than a long haul, *this* time.  :)
