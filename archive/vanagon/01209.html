Subject:      vanagon/caravelle, camper/westfalia

ok ... at home again, looking at the canadian sales brochure and sure enough,
it does say 'Vanagon'. which is odd, since all the dealers i talked to in
ontario called it a 'Caravelle'. ??? the brochure is from vancouver.

but, so far as camper vs. westfalia, i'm afraid i was right. ALL the u.s.
sales brochures from 1980 on up to 1991 refer to it as the 'Camper'. even
the little Supplement to Volkswagen Vanagon Owner's Manual refers to it
as a 'Camper'. and the bentley Official Factory Repair Manual by Volkswagen
United States says &quot;including Diesel, Syncro and Camper'.

the 1979 bus sales brochure refers to the camper as a &quot;Campmobile&quot;, not a
Camper nor a Westfalia. the same for 1977 and 1978.

can't say what the earliest ones were 'correctly' called ... i don't have
any brochures. the bentley book 1963-1967 lists only the microbsu, pickups,
ambulance, and kombi. &lt;after all that discussion about Kombi's, and nobody
noticed that i left it out!!!! mostly cause we never did really decide what
exactly it was.&gt;   anybody got any split-window bus (camper?) literature?
or owners manuals?

joel
