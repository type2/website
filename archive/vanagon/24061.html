Subject: Anyone going to tomorrow's VW Autofest?


The subject line sez it all!

Lawrence, MA - 9/3 - All VW SHow and Swap Meet.....Lawrence Stadium, Exit 42 0ff I-495...for info (508) 687-2206


I'll probably be driving up in the EV in the morning to see what &quot;toys&quot; are
available and to get Alex our soon-to-be 3 yr old a new set of Bug t-shirts.
