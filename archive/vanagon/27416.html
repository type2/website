OK, spank me.

I've pretty much ignored the whole gas heater thang, but now its all coming
crashing down on me.

Why?

A neighbor of mine, named Bob, who is a VW/Porsche/BMW guy, and I were
talking tonight, and I showed him the canvas thing I made for the bus.
I was telling him about the lack of heat, blah blah blah

So he sez&quot; What you really need is a gas heater&quot; and I said &quot;yeah, I know!&quot;
so he sez, &quot;I've got a couple, you want 'em?&quot;  I said how much?  He said
&quot;nothing, I just wanna get rid of them&quot;

So I'll prolly pick them up tomorrow or so.

Is there a faq or a sermon on these?  I don't know the model or anything,
just that one came out of a bug and one came from a thing.
