&lt;&lt; Today's problem with my buddy's new Carat is that the table does
 not unfold from the wall.
 
 I've never seen one of these tables before. It seems there is some sort
 of catch behind the table low on the side. Is it a positive catch, or
 some sort of jamming or spring mechanism: should he try to force it? &gt;&gt;

These genreally operate quite smoothly, and release from the &quot;stored&quot;
position by pressing them IN toward the wall.  This releases the catch and
they can be lifted up smoothly.  When they break, however, it's another
story!  If the catch jams, I know of no other way to fix it than pulling on
it until the latch breaks and then replacing/repairing it.  The sidewall on
the left side of the van can't even be removed with the table folded down!

Good luck,
Jim Davis
