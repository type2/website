Subject: I finally got it!!!

I apologize in advance if you are not interested in this, but I have to share my 
excitement with people who can truly understand the meaning of this event.

I bought my first 21-window on Saturday!!!!

The body, except for the front face is in great shape.  I understand you can buy  
the front face for under $200.  The only other thing that kinda sucks is that it 
was a bench and one of the owners thought he'd try and make it into a walk-
through.  The entire wall separating the rear from the front is gone.  I figure 
I could scrounge up one in a yard somewhere and cut it out and weld it in mine.  
There is no interior to speak of.  It has all of the windows and a 1600.  
Supposedly a new tranny and reduct gears.  I'll have to buy all new rubber, a 
headliner, possibly a ragtop, and whatever interior I need/want.  I'll probably 
make my own panels.  I will certainly finish stripping it and will paint it.  

Okay, before this gets too long, I'll say good-bye.  

Send me private mail to let me know what you think my purchase was worth.  I 
want to get an idea what you all think so I know if I got screwed or not. 

It's a '64.

See ya!
