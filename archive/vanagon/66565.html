Glenn, stop what you're doing!  VW is solid, sophisticated stuff.
Throw away the tongs, this requires a neuro surgeon.  I had my 95'
Eurobago wired for an alarm system.  The installer tried to rig it to
activate the door locks.  He crossed some wires, and the door lock
mechanism went haywire.  He returned the wiring to its original state,
and everything worked fine.  Check your fuses and wiring forward.
