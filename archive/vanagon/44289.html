Subject:  Leaky Filler Tube 75 Campmobile

Tobin Copley sent mail concerning replacing fuel lines.  I am gathering all
necessary parts for this procedure.  Does any one know how to replace
the filler tube.  I would definately say this should be replaced because I
have a nice brown line below my gas cap and at certain gas stations
their nozzles leak gas out the right side of my engine compartment.  I'm
really not sure how to get into this area (Upper left Corner by air ducts). 
I' ve had the bus for approximately 12,000 miles of its 94,000 and no
major problems yet, but this problem must be exstinguished soon!!!

                                                        Greatly Appreciate Any Advise/Help

                                                                       Patrick Flynn
