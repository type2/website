&gt;	sorry to respond to a question that is not vw, but i was
&gt;	sent a email message that there is a boy in new hampshire
&gt;	who is diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor.  they say 
&gt;	to send cards before august 25th to make sure he gets
&gt;	the cards before he passes on to get into the guiness book
&gt;	of world records.
&gt;
&gt;		is this a farse too?

I hate to sound like Scrooge here, but I think all these things, if not a
farse, are a waste of time.  If you really want to help some poor child it
seems like efforts should go into things like donations to your local
children's hospital, etc.  Let's get back to Vanagons.
