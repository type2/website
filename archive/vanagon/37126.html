Subject: Re: Rocker Shafts--1600cc

Hi Bob--thanks for the reply

&gt;only worn on one side.  If you install them with the unworn side down, they
&gt;will make a suitable replacement.

Who would've thunk?!  Thanks for the tip.

&gt;I don't know why anyone would want to bead-blast a rocker-arm shaft.  It is a
&gt;precision ground shaft.  Bead-blasting would destroy the polished surface.
&gt; Unless rusted, they clean up fine in carb cleaner.

Well, maybe it's my original post that wasn't clear?--I was refering to the
rocker arms themselves that are beadblasted and re-used in the Berg kit.
The shafts are new.

&gt;I keep a few unused, original VW parts as gauges, picking dimensions from
&gt;them instead of looking them up.  Trial fitting a known-good part is often
&gt;the best way to determine if the part it is being fitted-to is worn beyond
&gt;spec. Measurement by inspection, or trial fit, is a valid procedure often
&gt;called 'gauging.'.  Using a gauge is faster than using mikes or dial calipers
&gt;and saves wear &amp; tear on your precision tools.

I found the specs in Bentley last night.  They give an ID for the rocker arm
and an OD for the shaft and the wear limits.  Since I don't have a &quot;new&quot;
parts stash I'll just go the measurement route.  The shafts on mine are
visibly worn, but I wonder how prone to wear the rocker arms are--I'll know
about mine after measurement anyway.  The good news is I found another set
of rocker shafts from an engine I forgot I parted out long ago.  Maybe I'll
have a good usable set among all these parts!  It just goes to show you if
you look hard enough among your &quot;junk&quot;, you'll find just what you're looking
for (probably left by the greasy parts fairy).
