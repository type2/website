 I'm under the impression that the ring gear cannot be flipped in 002 and
 091 gearboxes the way it can in the bug box used in splitties. The early
 box uses a ring and pinion design more like classic bevel gears where the
 pinion axis and the ring gear axis are in the same plane - the centerlines
 intersect. The 002 and later 091 use a true hypoid design (stronger, can
 transmit greater torque&gt; in which the pinion axis lies in a plane below
 the axis of the ring gear. The teeth are shaped for this asymetrical   
 arrangement. 

 The Corvair engine does indeed rotate counter clockwise. Conversion kits
 that I remember reading about used the Corvair transmission in '68 and
 later buses. I think there is an article on this in one of the Brooklands
 books &lt;which I'm sure Joel has in his library&gt;.

 Another way to reverse engine rotation is to use a camshaft ground for this
 purpose. Abarth used this method to put Fiat 124 based engines into rear
 engine Fiat 600 and 850 bodies.


 Soooo, check the tranny on this pickup carefully before spending any cash.
 Converting it back to VW power may require both engine and transmission.
