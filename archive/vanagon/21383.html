Re: Compression Ratios

I just had the engine for my '79 Bus (a Type 4) rebuilt by Mark Stephens High 
Performance.  They rebuilt it stock (2.0 liter, German parts) except for the 
following mods to it:  zero deck height and &quot;unshrouding the combustion 
chamber.&quot;  From what I can gather, &quot;unshrouding&quot; is similar to a semi-hemi 
cut, but they cut head material from around the sprark plug, allowing a more 
efficient burning of fuel.  The compression is fixed at 8.0 : 1.  They say I 
can run 85 octane gas with this setup, with the engine running cooly.
