&gt;I'm in the process of rebuilding my '73 engine and I'm having the dickens of
a
&gt;time trying to get the heads off. 

Thump 'em with a big rubber mallet.......I'm not sure whether this is
approved engineering practice but it always works for me and does no
damage....... 

If you are pulling the engine down it doesn't matter if the barrels separate
from the case - it's a potential oil leak problem if you want to pull the
heads only and they separate.....
