&gt;I just called &amp; talked to Bruce.  They're not VW issue mats.  They're
&gt;aftermarket.  They are black with a brown area around the white Vanagon
&gt;letters.  I just bought a pair.  $10 + $5. shipping.
&gt;
&gt;

I just ordered mine, too!  Bruce told me he was wondering how he had so many
orders for these mats.  I'll bet he never expected calls from all over the
US!
