&gt;Since we're due to leave for Calif in 6 weeks or so, I'd like to 
&gt;change engine &amp; trans oil to synthetic - I've got some 5w50 already 
&gt;(&amp; VW filters...), but have yet to find synthetic trans oil around 
&gt;here (Victoria). I got some for my Jetta a few years back at the 
&gt;dealer (they just pumped a few litres from a drum), but there must a 
&gt;better source!

5-50 oil is not proper for this engine. Especially for extended hiway
driving.  I sugest Mobil1  15-50, or other equivalent, as it is a excelent
replacement for 20-50 that vanagon engine calls for.
