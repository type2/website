&gt;Stupid Sunday question. My '85 Westy has a knob to the left of the
&gt;sliding heater/vent controls for the rear seat fan unit-it is lit up when
&gt;the dash lights are on.  To the right of the sliding controls there is
&gt;also a fan knob for the front seat area which is not lit up.  Also, there
&gt;is no light on the gear shift position (automatic).  Is there supposed to
&gt;be sights here? if so, how do I get to each of them to replace bulbs or
&gt;whatever?  I can't find any reference to them in owners manual so I
&gt;figured maybe they don't exist???

the bulbs for the heater knobs are just behind the slider controls. you need
to remove the slider &quot;knobs&quot; and then pop out the faceplate (for the heater
controls), and you can see the bulb. it's a little wheat-germ kinda thing
(with two exposed contacts). it's expensive from VW, so you might want to
check at Radio Shack or some such.

i don't recall if there was a light on the gearshift or not ... :(
