&gt; &gt;My '85 Westy is blowing the (top)fuse behind the drivers seat alot&gt; &gt;

If the fuse blows immediately on switch on of the fridge/water pump, maybe
a &quot;slow blow&quot; fuse might solve the problem by handling the switch-on surge
current.

A more systematic approach is to put an ammeter (0 - 50 amps range, say) 
across the fuse holder and see how much current is being drawn for the
fridge and pump(s) and compare it with specifications and the fuse
capacity. It will give you an idea of whether it's the fridge/pump load
that's blowing the fuse or whether it's a wiring harness short.
