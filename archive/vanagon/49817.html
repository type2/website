        Well, we went for it! Taking off from Montara (Half Moon Bay) with
babies Jaxon and Charley, we reached the Yosemite Park entrance at midnight.
&quot;I think we missed the turn for the free convoy camp about a half mile
back&quot;, I told Hallie. Just then three busses, a TDI wagon and a H*nd*
careened into our rest stop. Let the games begin...
        We decided to slog through the night with the aid of a loaner CB
radio for entertainment (thanks Bradley). If the gov'ment ever installs
Clipper chips on CB's, they'd be useless. Finally, after a false stop at a
warm but tightly locked-up condo, the rag-tag convoy pulled into Pumice Dust
Campground at 3:30am. 
        &quot;Hey- how come I have to sleep upstairs by myself and you get to be
sandwiched by two little hot water bottles all night?&quot;, I asked Hallie
rhetorically. The next night I was granted a ski cap.
        It was fun to watch bus after bus arrive as I thawed out around the
fire Friday morning. From a tricked-out Syncro with powered sun visors, to a
bus sporting a fresh spray-can paint job (Who needs masking tape?).
        I thought to myself &quot;Now this is gonna be fun&quot;, and indeed it was...
Whoever thought leftover ravioli would make the biggest magnesium fire flash?
Go figure.
        Cheers to Kath &amp; Mark (master luthier), Busgrrl, Bren &amp; Ky-ky for
all their efforts. I, too, am a new deciple of Joel, Master Yarn Spinner.

See ya next time,
Monte
