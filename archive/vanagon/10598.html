This message does not contain anything about VWs but is close in general.
You may skip it if you want.
----------------------------------------------

The recent messages about the wacky temp light and the electical system reminds
me about the set up on Volvos.   Their engines are tilted toward the passenger
side with the water temp sensor on the bottem of the head.  The wire for the
sensor rests on the block.  Over time this the insulation breaks off and the
bare wire makes contact with the block.  This completes a full circuit which
make the gauge go past the hot range and disappear.  I have seen this happen
on several cars so it just a matter of taping up the wire.

Well one night this happened to my brother's car several miles from home.
He stopped and checked the water level by opening the cap.  Since it was hot
he lost a lot of water.  He drove home and told me what had happend.  I said
that the temp was fine it was just the wire was bad.  I also told him to let
it cool and fill it later.  He leaves for a date.  Then at 1am I get a call
that his car does not run.  Fortunataly he stops at a gas station when he
called.  I go see his car and the first thing I see is steam rising and oil
leaking.  &quot;Did you put water in it before leaving?&quot;  &quot;No, I guess I forgot&quot;.

Anyway he still driving that car today.  We had put in a rebuild engine and
he has learned his lessen.
