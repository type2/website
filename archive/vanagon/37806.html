Subject: Mods to install door speakers in v-gon?


Hope everybody is recovering well from St. Patrick's day!!!

The paper cone door speakers just don't cut it, and I want to install some 
5.25 in speakers in the same area as the current 4&quot; flush mount speakers. 
 However, the window crank handle arcs over the current 4&quot; speakers.  In 
order to install the 5.25&quot; speakers, the crank handle would have to be 
spaced out further from the door surface since the 5.25's stick out 1/8 to 
1/4.

Has anybody seen an aftermarket spacer for the window crank to space it out 
away from the dooor surface to provide more clearance?  Or, has anyone seen 
cranks that have a more aggressive bend?

Has anybody else put larger door speakers in the v-gon doors?  I don't 
really want to move them down further for fear of kicking them.

One further question:  what kind of aftermarket sound systems have list 
members installed in the v-gon?  I was thinking 5.25 mid/tweeter separates 
in the doors, a 3 way amp driving them and an 8&quot; woofer in the board under 
the rear bench.  Then at a later date, adding another 2 way amp driving 
6x9's in the airconditioning unit where the rear 4&quot; speakers are.
