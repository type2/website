Hello All,

Hi I'm Chris Gibbs, another Brit' living up here in Ketchikan, Alaska.  
I came accross this list via the Westfalia Owners Page!

I have an '88 Westfalia with around 250,000 on the origional engine, no 
re-build yet(other than new heads about 12 months ago).  Other than the 
usual problems the vehicle has been superbly reliable and easy to find 
parts for and repair.

Alas, about 2 weeks ago I noticed a small pool (P/S fluid) under the 
power steering rack, &quot;its grown since then.&quot;  Well, I called the usuall 
VW sources that I know of on the west coast and got basically the same 
answers.

The VW dealers are all asking for the old rack in exchange for a new 
one!  The new ones are coming from somewhere over on the east coast?  
All said that the racks are back ordered!  Oh yeh, they wanted $850 plus 
tax plus the old rack in exchange.

Does anybody know where these replacement racks are coming from?  Is 
there a way to get my old one re-manufactured?  With me being stuck out 
here I am at the mercy of UPS &amp; FedX anyway, so it doesn't matter where 
the service or parts are coming from!

I hope that someone can help, thanks for listening!

Regards,

Chris Gibbs
Ketchhikan, Alaska.

PS.  If anyones interested I've found a supplier for really neat propane 
heaters that fit under the rear bench seat.  They're from the UK, use 
virtually no propane and come with a nifty little thermostat that you 
can put up on the wardrobe of a Westy.  Mine cost me about $500 
including shipping (worth every penny up here too)!!!!!!
