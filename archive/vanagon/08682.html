&quot;J.&quot; says:
Anyway, I'm still convinced the radiator fan switch isn't running.  The 
motor seems to run hot (if you can trust the very intermittent dash 
gauge), and it smells hot and I get some burbling in the overflow tank, 
so I'm kind of thinking it is hot.

I was having similar problems... ready to replace rad sw.    uhhhhh, 
check the ceramic fuse in the fuse panel on the left side of the steering 
column.  I can't remember which number is the rad fan but look in 
your owners book.  Mine was blown.....  &lt;very sheepish look&gt;
