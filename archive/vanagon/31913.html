&gt;That's how my engine came as well.  No hole in the plate.  I've never 
&gt;bothered to get one with a plug in it.  I just undo the 6 studs and 
&gt;watch the hot oil run down my arm and splatter all over the place!

Yeah, add me to the list of the drain-plugless!  Trouble is, no local parts
houses have the proper gaskets for my plate - I resort to cutting my own.
Just another way to spend my time on a cold winter morning...
