We have Alex our two year old trained...

NEW BUG - his name for the late, lamented 79(80) Convertible

DADDY'S HERBIE - his name for my '56 Bug

ERWO VAN - his name for the EV

PORSHA - his name for  my wife's 79 Convert replacement - Porsche 944
         (note even the correct pronunciation!!)  ;-)

Alex even gets to decide which car he wants to go in...he asks for
it by name.


And, while I'm bragging....  8-)  Alex has found a new video replacement...
the Love Bug series was getting a bit long in the tooth...
Pink Floyd's Carrera Panamericana race video.._dot_complete with
Pink Floyd sound track!!  Kid's got some potential here!!


BRAG MODE OFF....  ;-)

Ric
