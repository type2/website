&gt;I left my 85 WestyGL  running lights on and had to get a jump, I ran 
&gt;it for only 
&gt;about ten minutes and then cut it off...it had to be jumped 
&gt;again...then ran for about 30 minutes and still won't start again 
&gt;without a jump...is this an alternator problem? Thanks for any 
&gt;advice,
