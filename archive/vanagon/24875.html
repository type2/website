&gt; On my Westie all you can do is pull air from inside - its  air

&gt;     vehicle, as far from the windshield as possible.
&gt;
&gt;      I think the non-Westie wasserboxers have a unit mounted up front and
&gt;     above, in the same location as the &quot;A/C&quot; on splitties, but I do not
&gt;     know if there is a fresh air option, or it is recirculating only, as
&gt;     well.
&gt;
All factory A/C on 86 and newer Vanagons draw intake air from inside the van
only.  If you care to add a little fresh air to the mix, consider opening the
rear ceiling vents above the windows.  The air entering here should be
readilly sucked into the A/C intake.
