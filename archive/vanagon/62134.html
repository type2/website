&gt; Well, its finally happened. Whole thging needs doing from Heads to Cat.
&gt; Any Ideas where to buy? BIG MONEY from the dealer.

See my website at http://www.busdepot_dot_com.  A complete original-style
Vanagon exhaust system, from the heads all the way back to the tailpipe, is
$299 for '83-85 or $469 for '86-up (excluding the CAT, which is another $99
if you need it).
