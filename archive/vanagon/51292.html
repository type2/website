Subject: RE: tire rotation on syncro

&gt;I don't think a 5 tire rotation is a good idea. First off; radial tires,
&gt;I'm assuming you're running them, can only be rotated on the same side
&gt;of the vehicle (front to back).  If you rotate radials left/right
&gt;(port/starboard) the steel belts will slide and ruin the tire in short
&gt;time.  Maybe you could do a 3 tire rotation...but then if you get a flat
&gt;you'll ruin your spare.
&gt;
&gt;From Bentley, page 44.1a:

Most tire manufacturers have changed their tire rotation policy on radial
belted tires. Previously, radial belted tires were to be rotated only from
front to rear and rear to front on the same side of the vehicle.

All radial belted tires approved for use on Volkswagen vehicles can be
rotated diagonally if unusual wear, such as feather-edging, is observed.
