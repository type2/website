        Hi.
        
        I don't have the parts that you need but I wanted to say hi (from
another diesel nut).  I also have a '82 diesel this has been my first VW
water cooled van and it was full of bugs when I got it, as such it has been
a learning experince.  But I'm still a diesel nut.

        Even with the afore mentioned bugs, of the three VW vans that I have
had the diesel is the best.  I have also had two other diesel autos and at
this point I am convinced that diesel is the way to go.
