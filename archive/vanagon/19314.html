Subject: Dictionary ... part II

I knew there was a reason I was confused, but piecing together the
pieces from several sources, it is getting much clearer. Here is what 
I've been told so far:

- Safari Bus

  Mike Wright:
	Dave Schwarze has a Safare, which has a permanently raised
	fiberglass top--sort of looks like a rowboat upside down on top
	of the Bus.

  Joel Walker:
	well, one definition of a Safari bus is those tour buses in
	Kenya that take tourists around out in the plains. but usually,
	when refering to buses, Safari means those tilt-out windshields
	on the Microbuses (split-windows) ...  it was designed for very
	hot (equatorial) climates, to get much more air and ventilation
	into the bus.

  Dave Kautz:
	Another US-made camper conversion.

  Dean Aukes:
	This is a conversion done in the U.S. - David Schwarze has one
	- he is an expert on these - his is a '73 and has a solid
	high-top (fiberglass), not a poptop.  I'm not sure if all of
	them were like that.  His came with A/C, refrig, closet, bed,
	and much more.  His web page has pictures of it.

- AdventureWagen

  Steve Johnson:
	There is a company that converts the basic VW bus/vanagon with
	a bubble top and various interior layouts that are made at the
	customers request.  They are in Northern California.

  Matt Goike:
	the adventurewagen i have is an 81.  it has no amenities aside from the
	extended top and storage area, and a fold-out bed (bench seat) below.
	fuller conversions included a pull-out bed upstairs, and possibly
	more.  i do not know if pre-brick adventurewagens were made, but the
	phone # of the company (adventure campers) is (707) 964-4298.

  Joel Walker:
	a company in the u.s. that made camper conversions out of vw
	buses. still in business (ft. bragg, ca) but not using vw buses
	anymore (fords and chevies and such nowadays). characterized by
	HUGE roof replacement, sticks WAAAAAY up, lots of headroom.
	... they also made 1968-1979 and even 1980-&gt; models.
	somebody on the list has a 1981 Adventurewagen made on a
	vanagon. but it's just a vw bus that someone other than
	vw/westfalia converted and sold as a camping bus.

- Campmobile

  Steve Johnson:
	I always thought that this refered to all VW buses with the
	camper outfit.

  Mike Wright:
	I drive a 68 Campmobile.  It's a Westfalia without sink, stove,
	fridge, &amp; poptop.  Just the bed, a table, the closets &amp; the
	jalousie windows.  These were the poor persons Westfalia, I
	think.

  Joel Walker:
	the name officially given by vw to the camper models (by
	Westfalia) during the 1956-1979 model years. some die-hards
	still call the Camper (which is what vw uses when refering to
	the vanagon camper models) a Campmobile. :)

  Dave Woodward:
	I believe that a Campmobile is the English conversion, I've only heard
	of them in pre 70's campers.

  Dean Aukes:
	This is the official name for the Westfalia conversion (done in
	Germany at Westfaliawerk and sold in the U.S. by the dealers)
	for the years '68 thru, I think '89 - when the Vanagon came
	out.  After that I think it was called Camper.
	 The layout is the same for the '68-'73; two front seats, one
	 rear facing seat, two seatbelts on the bed/seat.  Single cot
	in the upstairs pop top.  Luggage rack on the back, pop top
	hinges at front.
	 '74 &amp; on breadloafs; double bed upstairs in the pop top, two
	 front seats, two seatbelts on the bed/seat and more camping
	hardware with non-folding tables.  Luggage rack on the front
	(smaller than '68-'73), pop top hinges at rear.

- Weekender

  Dave Woodward:
	The weekender is minus the poptop and stove/fridge/sink but does have
	cubboards and the bed.
	
  Steve Johnson:
	Well, I think this is the 7 passenger Vanagon with a poptop like the
	camper a table, and a rear seat that folds out into a bed.  It came with
	an optional 12V refridgerator/cooler.

  Dave Kautz:
	This is the tough one, I've heard it used several ways. This is
	a camper by Westfalia that has less camping equipment and often
	has more passenger seating. I think it often includes a pop-top
	and curtains but will not have a refrigerator or stove. The
	Eurovan MV with the weekender package has a bench seat which
	converts to a bed in the rear, two backwards facing bucket seats
	in the middle with a folding table and two seats up front. I
	think there is a little cooler under one of the rear facing seats
	but I'm not sure.

  Dean Aukes:
	I think this was a lesser camper version (Vanagon?,
	Eurovan)with a smaller closet, fold down bed, fold up table
	(like the '68-'73 Campmobile) - no camping hardware like
	refrig, sink, stove, etc (although see post earlier today about
	the removable refrig offered at least in '85, with the special
	power socket).

- Westfalia ?

  Steve Johnson:
	All Type II conversions made by the Westphalia company.

  Joel Walker:
	the models produced by a company called Franz Knobel &amp; Sohne in
	some place like Wiederbru:ck ... the conversions are called
	Westfalia (not the same spelling as the german state) and come
	in several different models. the one most commonly seen in the
	u.s. is known in germany as the Westfalia Joker.
