 Their saying this is caused by a bad intake valve. Anyone know if this is
 right. &gt;&gt;

Sounds right on the money. If you want a confirmation, hook up your vacuume
gauge... what... okay... go BUY a vacuume gauge, ($ about 35.00) and follow
the instructions. I'd bet you'll see a seriously flickering needle on the
gauge, and the instruction book will confirm the diagnosis. How many miles?
Maybe time for a whole new top to bottom? We'll hope not.
