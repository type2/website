Subject: Re: after the Unknowns again!!

&gt;all i want to know is what model bus you drive/own/sleep in (and the year)
&gt;and where (country/city/state/province) you are in (or reasonably close to)
&gt;..

I, Eugene C. Palmer do hereby drive a 1971 VW Westfalia Bus, with the
furniture removed so I can see out the back, fit more stuff, and carry 4'x8'
sheets of plywood.  I reside in the state of California, city of Berkeley,
country of de USA.

Pulease don't be frustrated on my account.

Eug,
