Subject: non-VW /EPA/Parts Place/Civic Responsibilty
From: Scott Chen &lt;mac.chen_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

  Famous quote-If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the 
problem.  I got sick of driving to work every day, dealing with 
traffic, idiots on the road (including myself sometimes).  Bottom line, 
I made the decision to use my bicycle and public transportation when 
possible.  End result-I've put 1500 miles on my vehicle in the past 9 
months.  I commute to work every day on the bicycle- 18 miles each way, 
rain or shine, cold or hot.  It CAN be done.  I go toe to toe with city 
traffic to and from Washington D.C.  Everyone thinks I'm crazy...it's 
too far to ride, what about the danger, you could get killed....well, 
I'm still here, fitter and happier.  I save money on fuel and wear and 
tear on the old van.  Granted some people cannot ride a bike to work, 
but most can, they're just too lazy or unwilling to make some 
sacrifices to do it.  One less car on the road...
  Let's complain about Parts Place using popsicle and pampers boxes 
instead of complimenting them for recycling....You can complain about 
their lack of service or prices, but no matter who you order from, if 
the part works, I could care less if it was thrown through my window 
wrapped in toilet paper!
  Let's complain about MTBE dropping our gas mileage instead of 
realizing that maybe it's a cleaner burning fuel and helps reduce 
emissions (yet to be proven).
  Let's complain about the EPA slamming Joe Citizen instead of 
corporate America (which is also incorrect) and not be willing to pay 
higher prices at the pump, and in the stores for pretty much everything 
we buy, which is what would happen if the government was to revamp the 
pollution enforcement regulations.  Pollution is a by-product of the 
society we live in.  Environmental groups can(and have) purchased 
pollution credits to keep those credits out of the hands of 
corporations.  Part of the solution...
Are you willing to pay more at the pump and at the store, or would you 
rather go through emissions testing?  Find a balance, perhaps?  What 
are YOU willing to sacrifice?
   BTW, I work in pollution enforcement with the US Coast Guard, part 
of big bad government.  
My 2 cents
Scott
