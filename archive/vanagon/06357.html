Subject: Distributors revisited

Hi All,

So I managed to locate a vacuum advance distributor for my '70 bus.  
Now I have another question.

I have a Solex 34-Pict-2 carb on my bus, and when I looked at the new 
distributor, it only has one vacuum hose on it(where the previous one 
had two).  Is this a problem?  Can I just plug off one of the hoses 
from the carb, and be happy?  Or should I look for the same one I 
currently have?

Another question.  Is it possible to seat the distributor so that it is 
sending the spark to plug 3 when it should send to plug 1, or do they 
only seat in the correct manner.  If it were seated this way, would the 
vehicle still run?

Thanks.

Jon
