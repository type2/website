&gt; Here's a breif report on my (with wife &amp; 4 &amp; 7 year olds) recent 2 week trip

&gt; Visited Wailaki cmpgrnd, steep, narrow, winding road(at night!) - No Vanagons

When were you there?  Just a couple days ago?  

&gt; Finally! Hayward 3:40AM, a room with 1 bed.  Kids slept on the floor  : )  :

You came through Hayward and didn't let anyone know?


&gt; All this led up to me guessing that you'd be there.  I figured I couldn't be
&gt; 600 miles from home, 22 miles from a gathering, and not stop to say hi.
&gt;
&gt; Oh well, that said: Where (or when) were you???

Oh well... thanks for the try.  We were there on the weekend of the 
August 26 and 27.

Bradley
