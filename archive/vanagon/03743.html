A quick question:

I just had the insulated pipe from the heater boxes that runs under the
camper rust off. What do I do? I was so proud to actually own a camper that
had a little heat. Do  I get a new piece of pipe welded on? Replace it with
a piece of PVC pipe that won't rust? Replace it with some after market
piece. I'm going to put it away for the winter, but the nights are already
starting to get a bit chilly and fishing season is still open. Gotta keep
warm. Anybody got an answer?
