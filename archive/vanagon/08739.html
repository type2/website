Subject: Oh No!  Throttle cable jammed, can't replace

Help needed, please.  Here's the scoop:

Throttle started sticking last night, and got so that tapping the pedal 
with my foot wouldn't free it--had to pull it up by hand.  That got 
tiresome pretty fast.

But I have a spare throttle cable, so tried replacing the old one this 
morning.  Couldn't get the &amp;*$#_at_! old one out!  Got about 2 1/2 - 3 feet 
out, then it jammed.  Really jammed.  Solid.  Tried pushing it back in, 
bit by bit.  Got about 3 inches from where the cable should re-enter the 
engine compartment, jammed again.  Can't pull it out, can't push it back 
in.  Grrrr....

Tried shoving thick wire into the tube at the engine compartment to clear 
out any gunk in the tube... no luck.  Threw wrench across garage in 
frustration.  What's going on?

So all the shops are closed, I want my dear camper (grrrr...) on the road 
again, I've got a few free days.  Can anybody offer any suggestions?  The 
tube housing the cable appears the run solid from front to back, so I see 
no access points halfway.

Any help most appreciated.

Oh, and Merry Christmas to everybody (really).  Looking forward to seeing 
some of you at Pfieffer!
