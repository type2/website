&gt; 3. Tightening the alternator belt on the 79. The Muir book says to loosen
&gt; the allen head nut under the plastic cover and to adjust the alternator
&gt; body slightly to the right to tighten the belt, then secure the unit with
&gt; the retightened nut. But...er...what's the best way to &quot;adjust&quot; the
&gt; alternator unit to the right? I rassled with the thing for a few minutes
&gt; with my &quot;oversized &amp; guaranteed-for-life-flat head screwdriver&quot;(tm) to
&gt; provide some leverage and managed to slide it only incrementally over to
&gt; the right, but not enough to really tighten the belt.  Any suggestions on
&gt; this? 

If the bottom bolt is really tight, you may have to loosen it.  I think
it is a 13mm nut (one of those with the builtin plastic washer that
keeps it from turning easily) that can be reached with an open end between
the fan housing and the engine block.  Then again, I may be barking up the
wrong tree, or driving up the wrong road, or sumthin.  =)
