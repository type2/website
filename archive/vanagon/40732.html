Anybody want three 14 inch bus rims with good rubber?  They came off my 59' bus 
which had mix and matched sizes.  They can be had very cheap- possibly for a 
tank of petrol if persuaded.  We are located in sunny Albuquerque.
                                                        Danke vielmals-
                                                                Benjamin
