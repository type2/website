&gt;&gt;That's odd... on my '85 you push the lever toward the dash till get

&gt;&gt;then parks on its' own... are later models different or is your Switch

&gt;Tap it forward 'quickly' and the rear wiper will actuate as an intermittant
wiper;  push the lever forward &amp; hold it  and (eventually) the rear washer
pump will activate &amp; keep spraying until you release the lever, with the
wiper giving 3 additional sweeps, then reverting to intermittant mode.  In
either case, a quick push forward will disengage the wiper.  If you find the
wiper getting a mind of its' own (won't shut down, or wipes constantly
without a delay between swipes), then either the relay is going (more
likely), or the switch built in to the wiper motor itself is heading south
(less likely).
