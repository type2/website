Subject: Friday Humor: High-tech redneck (fwd)

With appologies to Joel...and Jeff Foxworthy.

You might be a high-tech redneck . . .

*  If your e-mail address ends in &quot;_at_overyonder_dot_com&quot;

*  If you connect to the World Wide Web via a &quot;Down Home Page&quot;

*  If the bumper sticker on your truck says &quot;My other computer is a laptop&quot;

*  If your laptop has a sticker that says &quot;Protected by Smith and Wesson&quot;

*  If you've ever doubled the value of your truck by installing a cellular
   phone.

*  If your baseball cap read &quot;DEC&quot; instead of &quot;CAT&quot;

*  If your computer is worth more than all your cars combined

*  If your spouse said &quot;either s/he or the computer had to go&quot;, and you
   still don't miss him/her

*  If you've ever used a CD-ROM as a coaster to set your beer on

*  If you ever refer to your computer as &quot;Ole Bessy&quot;

*  If your screen saver is a bitmap image of your favorite truck, tractor,
   or farm animal

*  If you start all your e-mails with the words &quot;Howdy y'all&quot;
