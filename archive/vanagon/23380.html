Subject: Re: winches

&gt;But the problem with using a winch often involves where to attach the cable
&gt;rather than the winch.  Since the only real tree in Baja is busy shading the
&gt;plaza at San Ignacio, finding someplace to fasten the cable can stretch your
&gt;ingenuity to the snapping point.
&gt;
&gt;Most of us just dig in.  Bury one of the spares, with the cable latched to
&gt;the tire-iron under it.  Pile on the rocks.  Sit on it.  
&gt;

Buy a small Danforth anchor, these are made of plate steel and have pivoting 
flukes that dig deeper into the seabed when your boat tries to drag. They 
work in sand! Lay out the line, push the anchor in to get started, then 
winch away. Don't forget to tie a retrieval line on the Danforth to pull it 
out backwards, unless you want to dig it out of several feet of sand.

The high lift jack is cheap and reliable and doesn't require 80-200 amps to 
work. Winch electrical hookup was enough to put me off the idea. 2nd 
battery, heavy wire everywhere, maybe a heavier alternator... Winching 
yourself out will drain a battery in short order. No fun if you can't start 
your van once you get back on solid ground. If you just want to get off 
slippery surfaces then a cheap block and tackle set, 1000lbs, 6 foot pull 
may suit. Packs away tightly also.

Now .... if I can just figure out how to drive a hydraulic capstan winch off 
the power steering pump......&lt;g&gt;   tim s.
