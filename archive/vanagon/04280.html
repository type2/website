Subject:      ARRRGGHHHHHYHHHHH!!!!! Damn *&amp;?$%&amp;#_at_

I went to look at bus #42 on the bus hunt for my wife. (You folks with non-VW
lovin' SOs - eat your heart out!) One question...

WHY THE HELL CAN'T PEOPLE BE HALF-WAY HONEST ABOUT RUST!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm more
bent out of shape on this one than the bus I went to look at where the guy
sang great soliloquies about the &quot;NEW ENGINE&quot;...kinda funny since I'd seen the
same bus at a garage 4 months before, saw the engine on the floor, and talked
to the mechanic who was to do the work. But I digress. I'm fed up with people
telling me about the one quarter sized spot of rust and me finding that EVERY
seam is rusted through and that the only difference between this bus and a
flintstonesmobile is the rubber mat keeping your feet up. F%&amp;_at_!!! Ok...I'm
calm now... Either the prices have been INSANE and I haven't even bothered to
look at it, or the damn things are ready to fall apart and they expect to get
real money for them. Anyway... I've vented enough. I'll be going to see Van
number 43 at a neighboorhood near you soon... Illigiti non carborundum est
