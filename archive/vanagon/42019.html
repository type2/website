Subject: Response: Polishing Glass

Since others were interested in this thread, I thought I'd post a reply 
from David Yates. In another note he mentioned that his dad uses 
Jeweler's Rouge to remove small scratches in glass...and suggests 
checking with local jewelers as a possibly supply source.

&gt; Joe, ordinary rubbing/cutting compound will NOT do, it simply isn't
&gt; hard enough.  Jeweller's rouge is the way to go.  It is used for
&gt; polishing gemstones.
&gt; regards from downunder.

Thanks for the response, David! 8) Joe ('71 campmobile -- &quot;AquaVan&quot;)
