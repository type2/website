John,
Check out the propane catalytic heaters at your local RV dealer. These
are compact, produce ample heat for camping, and are easy to install and
operate. No electrical connections are needed and no venting is
necessary. The only downside is that they consume oxygen, and you must
crack a window and/or pop the top to assure ample air supply. Cost for
the smallest one will be less than $200, and should do the job nicely. A
small oscillating 12 volt fan may used in the camper to help distribute
heat.
