I have the same problem with my fridge. I now keep
a bit of rubber tubing by the fridge so that
I can blow into the &quot;drain&quot; pie (sp) pipe.
It looks strange, a hunched figure puffing, pumping,
swearing and peering int the dark recesses of the
usually full fridge to see the faint blue flame
in the little window!
