&quot;something about making optional the splitting of the list...&quot;

Hear, hear!  I concede it's Gerry's right to do what he wants, since
it's been HIS time and efforts in running the list the way it's been.
But, for the formal purposes of taking votes on the matter, I stand
with Ric.  I've enjoyed the camaraderie of the list a lot.  As an
air-cooled person, I'd miss hearing about Steve Johnson's wasser-
boxer porta-potti, and from the syncro owners, whom we all know
prove to be a little &quot;strange.&quot;  :).  In addition, this impacts the
&quot;jump on the bandwagen&quot; organizing efforts of the camping trips, which
we all know and love.

Respectfully submitted,

busgirl (sobbing hysterically at the thought of this all)
