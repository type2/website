Volks,
	Tim Smith and I were talking a little about different floorplans
that have been used in the VW camper conversions over the years.  He
e-mailed me a nice ascii drawing of a European model split window camper
that I was curious about, and I sent him back one of my current layout
in the Safare.  We thought it might be appropriate to post them to the
list in case anyone was looking through the archives for such
information.  So, here is the layout of my camper, in nice,
space-conserving ascii:


  driver seat                      one  passenger
[______________]                  [______________]
================                  ================  &lt;- metal partition
|--------------|                  |small cabinet |     ( half height)
| __________   |                  |--------------|
| |        |   |                                 
| |   2    |   |                                 
| | burner |   |   &lt;-- Drawer below stove, fridge below drawer
| | stove  |   |      
| |        |   |       
| |________|   |
|  ___    ____/
| / S \  /
| | I | | 		&lt;-- Cabined under sink (No water tank, but
| | N | |             could put one there)
| | K | |            
| \___/ |        ________________
|------------|  /                \  |------------|
|            | | Removable table  | |            |
|  Seat      | | Drops down to    | |  Seat      |
|            | | support bed when | |            |
| (Storage   | | folded out       | | (Storage   |
| underneath)| |                  | | underneath)|
|            | |                  | |            |
|            | |                  | |            |
|            | |                  | |            |
|            | |                  | |            |
|------------------------------------------------|
 seat back, 2 piano hinges, folds back in U shape
|------------------------------------------------|

   Bedding in back is contained within the U shape
   created when the &quot;seat back&quot; is folded up.

  There is an additional cabinet in the rear on the drivers
  side, from the engine level to the ceiling, makes a good
  closet but I'm going to remove it (or reduce it's size
  substantially) to increase bed width.  The cabinet that
  contains the stove, fridge, and sink I built myself.  The
  sink is a real narrow one (only one I could find that would
  fit) from a '74 Westfalia (I think).
