Subject: Wanted: '67 cargo door handle, Help removing steering wheel

Hi all,

Metal fatigue (rusts evil twin) claimed my side (cargo?) door handle.
Anyone have a spare for a late splittie?

How does one remove a '67 steering wheel without breakage? Special tool? I
tried a gear puller, but I couldn't get it to &quot;hook&quot; on anything under the
wheel. It's pointed about 1:00 o'clock and if I'm even in an accident, I
expect serious rib injuries with it this way (less compliant).

Regards, Jim
