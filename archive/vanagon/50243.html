Subject: Re: help 82 diesel head gasket

DON'T punch any holes in the head gasket. Often times there are holes in
the block that do not have corresponding holes in the head gasket it is
nothing to worry about. The extra holes in the block make it easier to
remove the casting sand during the manufacturing process. The necessary
holes for proper coolant flow are there. You should very seriously consider
replacing the head bolt also.

&gt;there two holes in the head (near the hole off to the side, next to where
&gt;the notches are)that are not in the head gasket (the bently book does not
&gt;show holes there ether).
&gt;
&gt;        Should I punch holes in the gasket to match the holes in the head?
