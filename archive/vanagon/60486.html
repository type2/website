&gt;Couple of silly questions....

&gt;Anyone take their westy through a car wash?  Problems?  Plusses (like the 
roof
&gt;gets washed!!!).

You may visit a car wash for trucks. I did it at my previous employer, the
camper looks very small is a truck's hall. But it works.

&gt;Anyone know how to adjust the windshield washer so they don't fill up the 
roof
&gt;carrier instead of hit the windshield?

I have another problem: How can I boost the washer pump that the water hits
the windshield while I'm driving on a highway? I do not like to slow down 
for this.
