Subject: 66 VW Bug $250

One owner.  This car hasn't been driven in five years.  As far as I
know, the engine is in great working condition ... but the hydraulics
for the brakes need replacing.  There are no brakes.

Exterior is baby blue.  One fender is dented slightly and could be
replaced.  Could use a paint job if you want to spiff it up.

Black interior needs replacing.  Needs new seat covers, roof liner,
floor mats.

This car is perfect for the person capable of do-it-yourself fixing
and polishing.

For more information contact Christie Mueller _at_ 206-226-6180 (business
line).
