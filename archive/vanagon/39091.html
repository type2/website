&gt; So which musical groups should we sanction?  Hey,  the Beastie Boys

Lawrence Welk, of course!!!! :)  uh-one, uh-two (kinda sounds like a bus
engine, don't it??)

&gt;Unfortunately, the Gap didn't stock them, and some of our Busses became
&gt;unwilling donors to the fickle world of fashion....

fashion world? fickle?? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO .... :)

&gt;Drugs:  Who cares.  It's a personal decision and a victimless crime; one

well, i sorta tend to disagree a bit here ... my ancestors were American
Indians, and whiskey was the drug of the day back then. still ruins quite a
lot of Amerindian lives (and other ethnic cultures as well). yes, the buyer
has control over what he buys. but the seller ain't exactly sitting back and
waiting ... that's why they're called &quot;pushers&quot;. basically, anybody that SELLS
anything is a PUSHER. how many car dealers have you been to that a salesperson
didn't zoom over to your side within one or two minutes??? so i don't think
it's exactly a benign relationship. and some people are, unfortunately, not
able to make those sorts of decisions for themselves. otherwise, we humans
wouldn't be so much like a herd of sheep or cattle when it comes to politics
and taxes and war and such. we are all weak of will in many areas.

&gt;   I hope my sarchasm about Garcia's weight wasn't offensive.

no. but if i ever see you, i'm gonna sit on you. ;)
