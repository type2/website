John,

&gt; This is obvious, but if you're going to use a breaker bar (and a pipe, and
&gt; another bar, and...) to take off those big 46mm nuts, it'll make a big
&gt; difference if you have someone hold the brakes, every little bit of
&gt; rigidity helps.  You could use the e-brake, but chances are it's why you
&gt; want the drums off...
&gt; 
&gt; Still, the first time I took my drums off, I broke two 18&quot; breaker bars
&gt; in two consecutive days (and got a really dirty look from the guy at
&gt; Sears when I cashed in on the warranty the second time, maybe I shouldn't
&gt; have said &quot;this one snapped much easier than the other&quot;).  I ended up
&gt; having to use an impact wrench.  I can't believe Muir's hammer and chisel
&gt; method would ever work.

True, and thats why they make that wonderful 1/2 inch steel plate thingy that
you can place over your 46mm axle nut and then hit with a sledgehammer! Muir's
happer and chisel method might work, but it would be a tough job (I've done it
on 36mm nuts, and even that;s a task!) you still have to set the brake, but
snce you're using impact force to loosen the nut, it's much less likely to
cause the vehicle to roll away on you. I have that happen on Bug axle nuts,
'cause I got tired of bothering the people at Sears and bought myself a 36mm
impact socket and a 3/4 inch breaker bar. I can put a 5 foot piece of gas pipe
on this arrangement and do severe damage to any frozen nut! In fact, I've
broken gland nuts this way (must be more careful! :-) )

If you mant to avoid the need for an impact wrench, I suggest you get yourself
one of these wonderful axle nut tools. Any aftermarket VW shop should be able
to get you one. As I recall, they're under $10, and well worth the price!


Happy Bussing!
