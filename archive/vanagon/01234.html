&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Conversion of gasoline engines to diesel for vehicles already imported  is
&gt; apparently being done by several shops in California and N.Y.
&gt; 

If one goes to the trouble of buying a syncro with the intention of 
Diesel-ifying it, it might be better to drop in the Audi 5-cyl diesel
instead of the Rabbit 4-cyl.  South Africa has vanagons which have
the 5-cyl gas engines in them, so getting the bellhousing for the 
tranny from one of these should make the task of &quot;bolting up&quot; a lot
easier.
