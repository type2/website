&gt; i need some help here....i think my gas milage problem is a result of either
&gt; the carb or electric choke not working properly. i've read hayes and the
&gt; idiot's guide but still don't exactly know how to go about checking the carb/
&gt; choke. i have '74 bus with a single carb. would anyone be kind enuff to give
&gt; me pointers or advice so i can check these out. muir doesn't seem to like these
&gt; chokes much and doesn't bother to tell how to adjust one.

Ok, here's what I know:

Ok, all done!

seriously tho:

On the electric choke element on the side of the carb is a small dot.  On
the carb there are 2 marks like this || that you put the dot betwixt.  This
is the starting point.  If you rotate the choke around back and forth, you'll
see where it just starts to move the butterfly.  I set mine so it just off
the contact a bit when cold.  An old bus guy I know taught me this, and it
seems to work, but maybe _I'm_ doing it wrong, too...
 
&gt; i also seem to have a leak in a vacuum hose. when i start the van up sometimes
&gt; there seems to be a 'sucking sound' and somethime she idles very very low.
&gt; all this stops when the engine has been running awhile. my question: which hose
&gt; is the vacuum hose? the big, thick hose leading from the carb to somewhere?
&gt; please excuse my ignorance! heheehe

Hehehehehehehe! You said &quot;sucking&quot;! Cool! hehehehehehehehehe!
