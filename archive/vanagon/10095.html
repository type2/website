joe:

could help but agree wholeheartedly with your assessment of original old VW
curtains. Dig that checkered yellow and brown material. Right On!!!!!!
That stuff is hard to find in good shape. The sun rotted most of those
curtains out years ago!

&gt;On Sat, 14 Jan 95, Pat (&quot;Got any 12V stickers, man?&quot;) Walsh
&gt;&lt;walshp_at_ippdsgi3.nawc-ad-indy.navy_dot_mil&gt; drooleth:
&gt;&gt; Wow!  What a score on that parts manual!  If you're taking requests, I'd
&gt;&gt; certainly appreciate a copy too.  It sounds chock full of the minutiae
&gt;&gt; detail-obsesive owner/restorers such as myself covet.  (&quot;Hi, my name is Pat
&gt;&gt; and I admit to laboriously peeling the interior stickers from Westys in
&gt;&gt; junkyards and to picking up used trim screws from junkers instead of using
&gt;&gt; &quot;newfangled&quot; unoriginal ones from the hardware store.&quot;)  I could give you a
&gt;&gt; copy of my '70 Westy manual (covers '71 too, I'm told), or volunteer to type
&gt;&gt; up a summary of the changes shown through the years as indicated in your
&gt;&gt; manual (for inclusion in the gopher).
&gt;
&gt;I feel your pain, Pat.  Have you ever found yourself up to your neck in
&gt;fire-ants, trying to remove a siezed do-dad from a rusting hulk in a
&gt;tick-ridden junkyard, and said to yourself, &quot;God I LOVE these cars!!&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;I'll pass the word when I get the copies made.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;But how could I have forgotten the curtains?  By the end of '71, you've
&gt;&gt; &gt;lost those absolutely KILLER (sano, too, man) sliding-track curtains
&gt;&gt; &gt;over the doors, to be replaced with a three-panel snap-on up front and a
&gt;&gt; &gt;cheesy rod-and-pocket deal on the sliding door.  Oh pale echo of thy
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hm.  My '71 has one GIANT curtain that covers the windshield and both cab
&gt;&gt; doors and snaps in place.  You're saying it should have tracks?  Even for
&gt;
&gt;Pat's correct; I was being vague.  Herewith the particulars:
&gt;
&gt;My book refers to two &quot;series&quot; of cars:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;VW Campmobile 1968&quot;
&gt;8/1967 - 7/1968, Eqpt. SN 13001/1968 - 25000/1968
&gt;8/1968 - 7/1969, 00001/1969 - 18147/1969
&gt;
&gt;&quot;VW Campmobile 1970&quot;
&gt;8/1969 - 7/1970, 0.00001 - 0.20755
&gt;8/1970 - 7/1971, 1.00001 - 1.25000
&gt;8/1971 - 7/1972, 2.00001 - (the book is dated 9/71)
&gt;
&gt;[and you thought that Westy of yours was a '69, eh, newbie? :-) :-) BTW
&gt;can someone compare these production numbers with other sources?]
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The Serial Number of the Camping Equipment is shown on the
&gt;Identification Plate mounted on the lower left part of the rear seat.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;OK, in the period covered by this manual there were 3 changes to the
&gt;Westy curtains:
&gt;1. beginning in 8/70 (no SN given), the driver-compartment curtain
&gt;arrangement goes to the one-piece deal Pat describes above, PN 231 069
&gt;445, in case you want to check the dealer's parts counter.  You'll also
&gt;need 6 Druckknopf-Kugel (snaps), PN 231-067-654.  At that time there are
&gt;part-number changes to some of the other curtains, but no apparent visual
&gt;change.
&gt;2. beginning in 11/70 (equipt# 1.08 449), there are plastic straps to hold
&gt;the rear curtains open.  That's what it says.  My '68 Westy had 'em,
&gt;but they might have been added.
&gt;3. beginning in 8/71 (200 625), the sliding-door curtain gets the
&gt;rod-n-pocket treatment.
&gt;
&gt;Bee korrect!  When scrounging curtains for my '68 in junkyards, I came
&gt;across many variations.  Check the VIN.
&gt;
&gt;Inny kwustyuns?
&gt;
&gt;Joe &quot;Will unearth trivia for food&quot; Clark, ex-'68 Westy
&gt;'65 'vert, disassembled in box with original VW instructions and only 50
&gt;missing pieces
&gt;Lotsa VW toys n books n medium-rare VW funkia

&gt; calls itself&gt; &gt; Pat &quot;Too much time on
&gt;his hands&quot; Walsh, '71 Westy &gt; walshp_at_ippdsgi3.nawc-ad-indy.navy_dot_mil
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Joe Clark                                          Where there's no sense,
&gt;joeclark_at_freenet.scri.fsu_dot_edu                          there's no feeling.
