Subject: Re: If you've replaced your CV joints--please read

 
&gt; This is true at least of all OEM Bus/Vanagon IRS CV's and all FWD VW
&gt; CV's I have seen.  Showed this fact to Steve Dolan the other weekend in 
&gt; fact, but here is a puzzler, I always assumed the marking was month/
&gt; year, but I got one downstairs marked 14/81, long year I guess, 
&gt; ideas?  The point about a Golf/Jetta CV has me sort of intrigued as 
&gt; well as I would never have guessed that or even looked, anybody know 
&gt; more specifically are they thicker? different in any manner?  What 
&gt; models/years, rabbit/golf/golf GTI are all different.  I ask as 
&gt; sometimes the FWD peoples prices get really appealing would be good 
&gt; to know.

The first number may be the week, not the month. This is a common 
practice for some mfrs. 
Around here, the inner CVs for my Jetta are within $5-10 of the bus 
ones, for Lobro, around $80 CDN.
