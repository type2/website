Subject:      Baltimore tips

All,

My wife got us a free night in a hotel in Baltimore!  Now what can we
do with a 7 month old and a 5 year old besides the wonderous aquarium
and the zoo?  How is the parking downtown?  Should we bring the
Passat instead of the Westy for getting into parking decks ( the
westy is way too tall for most of them )?  Any and all suggestions
are welcome.
