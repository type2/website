Subject: re sending photos

&gt;
&gt;Can anyone make a suggestion as to how to send an images file via
&gt;E-Mail?  I am trying to send a bit map image of my Vanagon to an other
&gt;person. The last time I tried his server could not handle the attached
&gt;file size.   ?????

Best approach is to use JPEG compression, and start with the image at a
lower resolution, say 72 dpi, assuming it's just going to be displayed on
screen.
JPEG gives you different degrees of compression, usually &quot;medium&quot; is
sufficient for basic screen quality stuff.
(If you want to see the quality, *all* of the pictures on my web page are
JPEG.)

Now, what's the best way to generate it? One relatively inexpensive way
would be to use Adobe PhotoDeluxe, either Mac or Windows. There are
probably other ways, even shareware, but I know that one will work.
(PhotoShop works too, but it's a bit pricier!)
