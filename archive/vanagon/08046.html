Subject: Steering Wheel Angle

I'm 6'2&quot; tall and find I can sit comfortably behind the wheel of the 
70s campers. The 80s vanagons finds the steering wheel right on my lap.
I'd like to know what the steering wheel angle is on the Eurovans. Did VW 
finally make the steering wheel adjustable or is it still a fixed position?

Another question. Does someone make retractable seat belts for the 77 camper?
Or can they be cloned from other sources?

John
