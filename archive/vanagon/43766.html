Subject:       pointless ignition question

I'm going to be making the long drive out to California from 
Utah this summer, and I'm looking at ways to boost reliability 
and improve performance.  I am therefore looking at pointless 
ignitions.  Has anyone had any experience with allison, Krane, or 
Compufire?  I don't know if I can afford the whole $200 deal, but I 
would like to replace my points with an electromagnetic or optical 
pickup, since I understand these can be found for less than $50.  Has 
anyone had any experience with these, good bad or otherwise?  

I've read Bob Hoover's postings about the JC whitney offering, but it 
seems that one is only sold with a 009 distributor as a package.  As 
the proud owner of 4 good 009s, I'm not really in any sort of rush to 
buy a fifth spare.  So that's where I'm at.  

If I did go with Whitney, would anyone like a good deal on a new 
distributor?  (that's a serious inquiry, by the way).  Please contact 
me if you're interested.  Thanks!

--Shaun
