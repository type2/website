Subject: Suspicious Syncro Shifting Symptoms

Hail fellow Syncronauts - I need advice and moral support!  

On my '89 Syncro (95K miles) the shifting has actually gone beyond the
suspicious stage - I really should have said &quot;Sh*tty Syncro Shifting
Symptoms&quot;. Here are the facts of the case:

1) Since I got the van in October, it's sometimes been just a tad
reluctant to downshift into 2nd or 1st (hard to find the &quot;slot&quot;), but
I've never any problem upshifting. 

2) A couple of weeks ago (I only drive it a few times a week) it was
parked, and I started it up and tried to put it in reverse - no go,
shifter won't &quot;seat&quot;. Hmm. Tried putting it in 1st to rock forward - no
good either.  If I push the shifter hard enough I begin to hear a very
slight &quot;whine&quot;. By pushing the car backwards I was able to get it into
1st and drove home with no further problem.  

3) Since that time have had intermittent problems with it (wouldn't act
up for my fellow Syncronaut Larry) but it's getting worse.  Also seems
to go in waves - works great for a several trips, then performs really
bad for awhile.  Sometimes I can downshift, no problem, sometimes it
just won't find the slot. ONCE I had trouble downshifting into 3rd.
Never any problem upshifting. Mostly goes into reverse no problem, but
sometimes not.  Got it to shift once when it otherwise wouldn't by
matching the engine speed just right, but haven't been able to duplicate
that performance.

4) I've discovered that if I absolutely can't get it to downshift into
1st or 2nd - e.g., at a stoplight - that by turning off the engine I can
almost always get it in gear and then start the engine with the clutch
depressed.  A few times the van has actually begun moving slightly as
the engine starts up, as if the clutch pedal is not really depressed all
the way...

Did I mention that the PO had a complete tranny/clutch overall at 82K
miles (18 months ago, out of the 1 year warranty period) to the tune of
$2700?  That included all new syncros, by the way.  That kind of service
was what made me think I was making a safe buy, but I'm beginning to
wonder - has Syncro Madness caught up with me?  (Meanwhile I'm driving
Old Reliable [ha-ha], Da Rust Bucket.)

So before I throw myself on the mercy of my local Volks Cafe guys
(inexperienced), the local VW dealer (inexperienced AND a rip-off) or
the VW dealer who did the original tranny overhaul (experienced,
perhaps, but 60 miles away) I thought I'd first try checking, draining
and refilling the transmission fluid.  When I got under there in the
driveway I noticed a tiny dribble eaking out of the left side of the
differential at the CV joint, and although I've never seen any on the
driveway I guess it's possible that the level is low (was supposedly
checked by Volks guys last fall.) 

As you Syncronauts may know, however, the drain plug is in a heinous
position only slightly forward of the rear skid plate, whose removal
seems mandatory in order to drain the fluid (of course, Bentley is mute
on this subject.) So I guess I'm asking for a few different pieces of
advice:

A) Correct procedure for draining Syncro tranny?
B) Correct refill technique? (Pump it somehow?)
C) Current favorite transmission lubricant?
D) Any chance my symptoms are really related to lack of lube?

Woe is me - I'd heard enough Syncro horror stories to know what I was
getting into when I bought this car, but it looks like I may soon have
one of my own to tell...
