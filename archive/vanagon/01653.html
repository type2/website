        o This van is completely reliable and very dependable

    I bought this van in '89 from the original owner.  I used it primarily
    for bicycle races, mountain and road, around Colorado and surrounding
    states.  The best thing about this is that you keep your bikes clean
    and dry when going to the races!  It also is very easy to clean the
    interior after a particular dirty mountain bike race.  This van does
    not drop _any_ oil and has never let me down.  I'm asking $1900 for
    it and test drives are welcome.  Call Jim at 447-8665 or just email
    back at this address if you have any more questions.
