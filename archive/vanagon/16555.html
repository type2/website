Subject: I've been had.....

Hi all....

A buyer beware story for you, finally tracked the previous owners mechanic 
for my '87 Syncro. Longtime VW mech 30+ years, factory trained but 
independent for last 20 years. And the story goes something like this.

So, the heads were done 18 mos ago, new gaskets? yup? any cracks? nope, new 
or rebuilt heads? well, we skimmed them, they were kinda pitted. You mean 
you you milled them down? nope, skimmed them with that metal putty stuff and 
made'em flat again.   AAAAAAAARRRGHHH, I've been had. I wonder if the dealer 
knew this?
I have just sold my '85 panel, with clean flat uncracked heads and newish 
gaskets, he picks it up tomorrow. AAAAAARRRGGGHHHHH. I agreed to $4000.00 
for the panel with a '71 Westy interior, no poptop. Today there is an '85 
Westy in the paper at $11,000.00 and an '84 at the dealers for $10,000.00. 
AAAAARRRGGHH. I'm going home to beat my forehead with a wooden plank. Have a 
nice weekend.
