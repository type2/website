Subject: Re: '78 WESTY SHOULD I BUY IT???

Dear Patty:

 As far I know 1978 is one of the best years for Westies. The combination of
fuel injection, 2.0 liter engine, unleaded gasoline and strong body construc-
tion gives to this bus very good reputation. For a mint '78 Westy in cherry
condition people pay up to $7,000 (less than 50,000 miles on it and straight
metal). Go for the Campmobile Deluxe with a stove and 12 volts refrigerator.
Good luck!
