Subject: Vanagon Westie interior lamp

I'm well aware of sensitivities about ugly artless bad Westie 
modifications.  I've recoiled at some I've seen, but not all.  One I'm 
considering making seems in the spirit, character, and like the efficient 
utility that propelled its original design.  My '83 Westie has the 
overhead rear storage unit just behind the rear seat where I recently 
tried to read at night.
  The illumination was poor.  The original light over the kitchen is 
incandesent, so it produces about 80% heat and 20% light.  Its location 
produces text glare for rear seat occupants and is in their field of 
view, two lighting errors for reading/eating use.
  I think a long thin flouresent lamp and switch mounted on each side of 
the overhead storage cabinet's door handle would be nice yet minimally 
intrusive.  The electronic balast(s) would be mounter on the door's back 
side.  The following are all enabled by this installation: recomended 
over-the-shoulder reading/dining light source, high efficiency (typically 
80% light), a variety of potential color temperature lamps, and second 
position utility.  By placing the lamps high on the door's front surface, 
when the door is swung down to open, they'd also illuminate the engine 
compartment, bed reading, and the space hehind the rear hatch.
  The only item I haven't located yet is a source for tidy front bulb 
covers.  Does anyone know of a source?  Also, how's this sound?
