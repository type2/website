Subject: fs:67 pop top, 66 ghia

My friend has a '67 factory pop top, white, no rust, canvas good, good 
front end, good tranny, killer camper.  $2500.00 as is w/ no engine or 
negotiate higher for custom engine your choice.  This guy sold me my '71 
pop top and I am very happy with the work he did on it.

'66 ghia sat for 15 years, no motor, body straight, left fenders have 
rust.  Body straight, pan, roof, doors good. Chrome good.  $500 as is or 
best offer.

E-mail morrison_at_rohan.sdsu_dot_edu and I will put you in touch with my friend 
Ron in San Diego, Ca.  Serious inquiries only please, I am doing the guy 
a favor.
