&gt; Um, uh me too.
&gt; 
&gt; $450 from the dealer seems a little steep for a piece of sheet metal you
&gt; can bend with your hands.

&gt; &gt;So I need a replacement bumper, but not the end caps. If anyone has
&gt; &gt;one available, or knows where to find one, please let me know.

This was on my specials list a few weeks ago, and I sold what I had, but my
source has ordered more  for me, so hopefully I'll have them again in a
couple of weeks.  They are brand new Vanagon rear bumpers for $150.  I
don't think I'll run them at that price again on the website, but I'll
honor the price for list members. These bumpers look the same as the
original ones except that they lack the holes for the rubber impact strip,
so you'd either have to drill holes or not use the impact strip (which
would look okay since there are no holes anyway).  Any first impressions
from the list members who bought my first few?
