Subject: Pre-'75 Bus Ignitionswitch

To all who have problems with the seemingly unremovable ignition switch,

I found out how it works, it cost me a lockcylinder and some time reading
the Haynes manual, the one that leaves you in the dark about this.

I'm gonna try to explain how i removed my '73 lockcylinder (without steeringlock)
in order to remove the cast block that accommodates the cylinder and the white
plastic ignitionswitch. I call this part the ignitionlockhousing. I assume that
the steeringcolumn is already removed from the car and that the bracket that
attaches the column to the dash and frontpanel is removed. As someone mentioned
in an earlier post, the white switch removes easily by removing the tiny setscrew.
the ignitionlockhousing is held by two hidden 6mm screws, these are located *IN*
the two threaded holes closest to the steeringshaft-tube. (i had to smile when
i first saw this :)  ) The assy still can't come out, the cylinder has to come
out of the lockhousing first. The cylinder is locked in place by a spring, in
order to remove the cylinder you have to depress the spring. In most AC VW's
i have seen, there is a small hole in the lockhousing which allows entrance of a
small screwdriver so you can depress the spring and pull the cylinder out, if you
have the key it's easier to pull the lock, but it's not necessary. So now your
looking for this hole, (btw. in some post'74 Busses with the newer style lockassy
you have to drill this hole yourself) no matter how long you turn and look at the
thing you will not see it, it *IS* there, about 10 to 13 mm from the
cylinder/housing parting line.
Make yourself a new tool, use a piece of sturdy bailing wire, not too thick, bend
one end into a hook, you should end up with something looking like this:

With this thing you have to pry/feel/poke/search for the aforementioned hole on
the invisible side of the lockhousing, bend/adjust your tool when/where neseccary.

I appologize for my lousy explanation, but i could not withold this info.

Hope it helps,

Brian.
