&gt;I'm the one that complained about poor idle on my '85 van. It's always
&gt;fun to go down various paths to attempt a fix:) I thought my idle
&gt;stabilizer had gone out and was in the process of trying to prove it
&gt;when I discovered the van was runing very rich. Hmmm... this was always
&gt;a symptom of a dirty resistor substrate in the air flow meter.

Here's the latest: 

Items replaced... temp sensor, coil, plug wires, plugs, cap and rotor.

Still runs rich and stumbles as a result. Much smoke out the tail pipe.
Still suspicious of the air flow meter even though I shifted the
resistor substrate.

What's new:

I called a mechanic that will actually give info over the phone and he
suggested looking through the air filter end of the air flow meter to
see if anything was bent as a reult of misfire. I'll do this tonight
after work but I don't remember anything that delicate. As I work the
throttle there never seemed to be anything hindering the wiping action
on the resistive substrate. Anyway I'll check tonight. Anybody else
have experience with the inards of the AFM? 

Thanks for the replies so far. I will physically check the spark as
suggested by another poster.

Steve
