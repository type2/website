Subject: (Fwd) Scam Alert 

To all:

Beware,

I got burned by this, though I hate to admit it.  It's a funny message
you get, but an expensive one.  

I'm still waiting for my phone bill.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;******* SPECIAL ALERT *******
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;SCAM: Don't Respond To Emails, Phone Calls, Or Pages Which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Tell You To Call An &quot;809&quot; Phone Number
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;This is a very important issue of Internet ScamBusters! because it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;alerts you to a scam that is: - spreading *extremely* quickly - can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;easily cost you $100 or more, and - is difficult to avoid unless you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;are aware of it. We'd like to thank Paul Bruemmer and Brian Stains
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;for bringing this scam to our attention - both will receive Internet
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ScamBusters! tee shirts.  This scam has also been identified by the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;National Fraud Information Center and is costing victims a lot of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;money.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;There are lots of different permutations of this scam, but here is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;how it works:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Permutation #1: Internet Based Phone Scam Via Email You receive an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;email, typically with a subject line of &quot;*ALERT*&quot; or &quot;Unpaid
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;account.&quot;  The message, which is being spanned across the net, says:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;----------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I am writing to give you a final 24hrs to settle your outstanding
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;account. If I have not received the settlement in full, I will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;commence legal proceedings without further delay. If you would like
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;to discuss this matter to avoid court action, call Mike Murray at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Global Communications on +1 809 496 2700.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;----------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Permutation #2: Phone Or Pager Scam You receive a message on your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;answering machine or your pager which asks you to call a number
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;beginning with area code 809.  The reason to you're asked to call
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;varies: it can be  to receive information about a family member who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;has been ill, to tell you someone has been arrested, died, to let you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;know you have won a wonderful prize, etc.  In each case, you're told
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;to call the 809 number right away.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Since there are so many new area codes these days, people unknowingly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;return these calls.  If you call from the US, you will apparently be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;charged $25 per-minute!  Sometimes the person who answers the phone
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;will speak broken English and pretend not to understand you.  Other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;times, you'll just get a long recorded message. The point is, they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;will try to keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;charges.  Unfortunately, when you get your phone bill, you'll often
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;be charged more than $100.00.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Here's why it works:  The 809 area code is located in the British
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Virgin Islands (the Bahamas). The 809 area code can be used as a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;pay-per-call&quot; number, similar to 900 numbers in the US.  Since 809
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;is not in the US, it is not covered by US regulations of 900 numbers,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;which require that you be notified and warned of charges and rates
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;involved when you call a &quot;pay-per-call&quot; number. There is also no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;requirement that the company  provide a time period during which you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;may terminate the call without being charged. Further, whereas many
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;US phones have 900 number blocking (to avoid these kinds of charges),
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;900 number blocking will not prevent calls to the 809 area code.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;We recommend that no matter how you get the message, if you are asked
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;to call a number with an 809 area code that you don't recognize,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;investigate further and/or disregard the message.  Be *very* wary of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;email or calls asking you to call an 809 area code number.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It's important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam, since
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;trying to fight the charges afterwards can become a real nightmare.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;That's because you did actually make the call.  If you complain, both
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;our local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;to get involved and will most likely tell you that they are simply
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;providing the billing for the foreign company.  You'll end up dealing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Please forward this entire issue of Internet ScamBusters! to your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;friends, family and colleaguesto help them become aware of this scam
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;so they don't get ripped off.
