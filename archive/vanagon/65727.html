&gt; I thought it might be
&gt; construed by others that the aux. air regulator changes the air/fuel
&gt; mixture, which is a common misconception.

Sean,

No problem. Those regulators used to go bad on my Saab 99GL and 900 every
two years... ridiculous design... a sliding metal to metal 'seal' inside...
as it gets dirty, the coil moving it has to work harder, fatiguing it more,
then they stick a little ways open, get dirtier, etc. etc. Credit planned
obsolescense. But easy to fix. In many ways, they are better than the
damn computers... at least you could *touch* them 8-).
