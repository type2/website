So RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu says:
&gt; 
&gt; I need to correct Steve's remarks a la Muir...I NEVER  have fallen
&gt; on the bash-Muir bandwagen...like Steve...Muir got me into the
&gt; repair my own...and then into the repair other's VW business...
&gt; 
&gt; I do however admit to being a member of the &quot;Chilton makes
&gt; good toilet paper in a pinch&quot; Club.

For those of you that may have construed from my previous post
that I was saying the Ric and others were bashing Muir, that it
is a complete misunderstanding.  I meant to say, that I (me, that is)
take the posted information by these kind and informative individuals
and use it as I can even though it may have 'some' mis-information
or may be 'factually challenged'.  So, before I get myself into further
trouble, I'll just apologize to anyone who felt offended because my
wording may have been not well ordered.

Cheers!
