&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; I just heard on the news that the U.S. Border Patrol is buying up
&gt; hundreds of old Volkswagen busses in southern California and southern
&gt; Arizona to be used as stealth vehicles for patroling various backcountry
&gt; areas along the U.S.-Mexico border looking for drug smugglers.
&gt; 
&gt; They quoted some guy named Vince Claypool, a USBP spokesperson as saying
&gt; that they were planning to put some sort of big 6-cylinder engine in 'em
&gt; and modify the suspension to handle better in high speed chases but that
&gt; the outside would be left as is.  Aparently, they are looking for busses
&gt; from the years 1968 to 1979 because of their resemblance to Mexican busses.
&gt; He said the high ground clearance of the busses is also a plus for this
&gt; operation (code named 'hipster').
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, I wonder how much they're paying for busses, I've been trying to
&gt; sell my '73 Westphalia.  And will they sell the busses back to the public
&gt; when the operation is done?
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody else heard anything about this?
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; 
Yuck!  I can't believe they're going to ruin hundreds of old VW buses
like that!  

They'll probably sell the buses back (or auction) but the buses will be
torn to crap by the time the Border Patrol gets done with them.  

I'm really disgusted by this news.

Sean
