&gt;All you Diesel-Vanagon and Wasserboxer drivers out there, how long after
&gt;you start your engines, does it take for the cooling fan to come on?
&gt;Particularly in springtime weather-- it's around 60 degrees here in San
&gt;Diego where I'm doing this.

I've had mine since August 1995 and the only time it has gotten hot enough
for the fan to come on was when the outside temp was in the 95 to 108.  But
latley the only fan I've  had on was the heat!  Down in the teens tonight.
 Stiil a lot warmer than the -31 about a month ago!
