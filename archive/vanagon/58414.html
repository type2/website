Subject: Need a new companion


 
Ever since I was eleven years old, I've had the &quot;love wagon&quot; (1984
Pontiac Pareseanne). Back then, she was known as the grocery getter. My
family and I travel all over the western United States with her. She
helped me learn how to drive, but parking the big lady was a bit
difficult. Every weekend during the summer, she hauled the family to our
Northern Minnesota cabin. She has taken me back and forth to college,
accompanied me on my road trips, and even made the trek from my homestate
of Minnesota to my new state of residence Florida.
I'm afraid after +200,000 miles my love wagon is ready for a long rest.
I need a new travel companion and a Volkswagen vanagon would be perfect!
Finding one for sale in Florida has been difficult. How do I go about
finding a vanagon? Where do I look? My big blue friend has always been
around and I've never had to look for a different one. Hopefully some of
you will have a couple of ideas. Thanks to anyone who can help!
