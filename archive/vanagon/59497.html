Subject: School's Out For the Summer!
Date: Wed, 7 May 97 18:15:09 EDT

Hey all,
Just to let you know that I will be departing MWC here in Fredericksburg
VA tomorrow and will be making my way to Johnson City TN on Friday.  

This really isn't a goodbye as I'll have e-mail over the summer, just in
my mom's name.  

For those interested, my summer e-mail will be lbart_at_preferred_dot_com, but
please don't send anything to that address until at least Friday.  I'm
helping my girlfriend move into her apartment tomorrow.  

I've got the Westy loaded up.  It's amazing how much those damn things
will swallow, even with all the camper stuff taking up space.  I've got
almost everything I own in there (except the computer!) and it's not
even blocking the rear window.  No, I have a LOT of stuff :-) .

It doesn't seem much slower in acceleration but it does take a bit
longer to stop.  I'll have to keep that in mind when driving.  

Well, take care all.  I'll be online and reading mail until probably
around 9:00 tomorrow morning, then I'm packing up everything and heading
out.  

Sean
