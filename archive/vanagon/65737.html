&gt;I'm currently considering purchasing a 1978 Westy.  Could you send me a list
&gt;of upgrades.  I'm also intersted in increasing engine power.  This model is
&gt;equiped with A/C (not presently working).  Is this worth the trouble of
&gt;recharging and putting in commision?  By the way, the page is awesome.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Ray (Va Beach)
