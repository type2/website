Subject: Bye for a while


Well, it looks like it's employment-change time again-- the curse of an
engineering contractor's existence. I'll have to be off the list for
a while, until I find a new address to receive posts.

For me, means coming cold turkey off my vanagon_at_lenti habit. For everyone
else, it means blessed relief from one of the bigger mouths on the list.
But I'll be back. Thanks to all of you who put up with my long-play
spiels-- I hope they did more good than harm overall. And a BIG thank
you to those who helped me with myriads of VW problems.

Hope to be back soon.

But, regardless, I'm not taking the vanagon_at_lenti sticker off the
V6anagon.   :-p
