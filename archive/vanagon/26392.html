 Well originally it was Earls Court, but they all moved on from there
 a few years ago, and I'm not sure where now. But I understand the Oz 
 network is alive and well and still buying/selling campers.
 They've got their own magazine that you can find around the place
 which would be a good way to start. Failing that, 3 times a week
 an advertising paper called `Loot' (costs around a pound) is released that 
 quite often contains camper ads.
