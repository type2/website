&gt;with everything from lysol to bleach, but so far no luck.

&gt;What do you think would work best?

	Its a long story how I know this, but there's a product called
&quot;Nature's Miracle&quot; that you can buy in pet stores- comes in a red and
white plastic squeeze bottle. Its an enzime preparation, takes 2 weeks
to work, but it DOES work, on cat urine anyway. Its not cheap-
$15 for a quart. But what the heck?!? I hate that smell...

	Read and follow the directions. I used it on a matress in
my home, and it worked successfully, when lesser products failed.
