&gt;&quot;Why would I want a link to GEX from my page?  I thought their stuff

&gt;At least I know people who told me their stuf sucked... &quot;
&gt;
&gt;Their stuff better not suck! I just realized that they built the engine
&gt;in my Syncro I just bought!!! I wonder if they have any transferable
&gt;warranty!!!
&gt;
&gt;I am going to e-mail them to  see what's up with this engine. We will
&gt;see what they have to say. The people who put the engine in said they
&gt;do good work. Has anyone else had any work done by them?

I have used many of thier engines.  Especially air cooled.  Only problems i
have had was with customers cooking them.  I have dealt with them for
warranty and they are somewhat fair.  They used to even pay the labor for
re-instalation,(measly $25/hour, better than nothing).  My only concerns,
they do not Align boretype 4 or waterbxer engines, VW does.  As they even
sell Waterboxer rebuilt heads separately of a fair price, I'm sure they do
weld repairs.  I have used many Rabbit gas and diesel heads form them as they
are less expensive than doing them myself sometimes, never a problem with
these.
If yu have the paperwork for the engine in your van, they can probably
transfer the warranty.  Some warranties are extendable to 3 year/36K.
