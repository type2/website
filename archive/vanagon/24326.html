Kevin,

You said your rotor turned black, does it look like
something burned in there?
You could check out the vacuum advance membrane for
leakage, if this leaks it would allow the fuel mixture
from the manifold to come into the distributor, you have
enough sparks there to ignite it.
Also, the engine could suck false air there, giving you the
stalling idle you mentioned.

Brian.
