you will, of course, notice that the 71's have allowed their lead to
errode, while the 85's have quietly been massing over behind the
chicken coop. :) and, of course, the 73's are down but not out, as are the
82's and the 84's.

all you Unknowns could be helping out here, instead of lurking behind the
tire rack at the Great Garage of the Internet (Last Chance Garage?). just a
little note (to me, of course) and You, Too, Can Be A Statistic! ;)

and, no ... i don't feel much like singing.
