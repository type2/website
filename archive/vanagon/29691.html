Be careful....
the 14.5 is a good top limit for the voltage you should expose your
Van's electrical system.  When and if you get to increase the
regulator output voltage, all of the circuit in your vehicle will be
exposed to it.  Depending on what electronic devices you've got
attached, some of them may not actually survive anything higher than
14.5 Volts... 

I'd take a very serious look at the VW guidelines and the
electrical/electronic equipment in your vehicle before you subject the
circuitry to anything above 14.5V, lest you might end up frying some
components. 

BTW, the story that the marine battery needs a higher voltage to
charge is a little intriguing.  Can you get exact specs for the
recommended charging of this marine battery?  How many amps charging
current at what voltage? Is this something someone at the battery shop
told you out of experience?  It seems that 13.0 - 14.5 Volts should do
just fine for the marine battery, with maybe the top 5% or so of the
charge taking a little bit longer to stuff into the battery.   Real
expensive batteries (used in providing UPS for computer equipment in
computer labs) come with &quot;charging curve&quot; plots, which tell you how of
the capacity you can expect to have charged in how much time.

Good Luck,
Cetin

 &gt; I would love to turn the voltage up higher, especially since I am running a
 &gt; marine battery as one of my batteries. These marine batteries require higher
 &gt; voltage than normal automotive batteries to charge properly so I have been
 &gt; advised I will never be able to charge them enough.
