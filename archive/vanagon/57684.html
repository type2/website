Subject: 85 westie steering noise

Hi !
You have helped us in the past,  maybe you can again. Our 85 westie 
steering wheel makes a scraping sound everytime we turn it. We have 
taken the plastic cover off the column and cleaned out any grime we 
saw, this stopped the noise for about 2 days and now the noise is 
back. We see the two metal plates rubbing against each other is this 
the way it is supposed to be?

Thanks,
 Karen - Choctaw Lake
