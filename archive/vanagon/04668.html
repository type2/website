&gt;&gt;and ham radios and cellular phones &lt;has anybody REALLY got one of these in

&gt;
&gt;Uh, ya. Are you gonna ban me from the list now?

no, of course not. :)  i've been 'thinking' about one myself. my nephew got
one put in his little honda Pocket Rocket (Over-Weight Roller Skate is what
i call it) and it (the phone) has proved extremely useful several times.
actually, much MORE useful than a cb radio. more expensive as well, but the
costs are coming waaaaaaaaay down rather quickly these days. it's the
monthly charges (even if i don't use it) that are holding me back right now.
maybe if they figure a way to tie it to my home phone bill, then i'll never
'notice' it. ;)

i know that martha has that portable thing, but since i've disemboweled my
cigarette lighter (it's a long story that has nothing to do with smoking or
cigarettes), i kinda don't have any nice place to plug it in. and portable
makes more 'sense', cause i can take it out and use it in other cars.

BUT! if you have one in the bus, where did you put it (phsyically)? where's
the antenna? etc. which kind? (fixed mount, portable, Nokia, Wal-Mart, etc.?)
