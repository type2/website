&gt; This is yet another van from VW, separate from the &quot;Eurovan&quot; (U.S. name)?

 Yes. Not really a van, though, more like a car without a bonnet or boot.
It is similar in concept to the Renault Espace and Toyota Previa.

&gt; Local VW salesman says that the Eurovan is *not* selling. (I went in to say

 Hmm, US market problems again. They are pretty popular here despite being
more expensive than most of the competition.

&gt; not particularly quiet).  The salesman said that he'd skip the VR6 and go
&gt; with the work-horse (Audi) 5-cylinder, if it were up to him.

 I've only driven the Audi-5 (diesel). What engines do you get in the US?

&gt; Can we have the Vanagon back? (VW start manufacture again...) Are Vanagon's
&gt; still being made?  Will the dies be shipped to Mexico and Brazil to bring
&gt; them into the '80s?

 I don't think many people in Europe would want to see the Vanagon back.
The Eurovan seems superior in almost every way- my only criticism is the
lack of length in the interior which, in Europe, can be countered by buying
the long wheelbase version (though that's more expensive on a ferry).

 I think the root of the problem is that the van was designed for the European
market, in which (as far as I know) it's being successful. While this policy
has worked for VW in the past it doesn't seem to be working now. Given that
VW probably don't have the necessary R&amp;D effort to produce vehicles
specifically for the US they seem to be stuck with modifying their existing
lineup to meet US requirements and that doesn't seem to be working. Presumably
since they are committed to remaining in the US they will either continue to
become a niche manufacturer or the US buyer will start to appreciate what VW
has to offer again. In my opinion what VW need to do is to sort out their
perceived quality problems in the US (either by solving them or by changing the
perception) and then start a serious marketing campaign to encourage people to
buy the cars. VW seem to be perceived very differently by the buyer in the US
and Europe and this is an issue which they need to address. Whether they do
this by selling cars that meet the US expectations or by changing the US buyers
perceptions to suit the cars they want to sell is an interesting issue.

Cheers,
        W.
