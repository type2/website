Subject: Re: '87 exaust parts

Thanks Tim for the Ottawa contact.  I will try them today.  Yesterday I
phoned a few places here in Ottawa and in Montreal.  I came up with a
mirade of prices for the bits.  Manifold pipes  $140, $180, and $320  You
choose !   Mufflers:  $44.95 (Canadian Tire, probably made from tissue
paper), $128.00, $134.00, and $367.00 go figure.  Tail-pipes from $25.95
(Canadian Tire again), $44.95, $55.95, and $28.95.   Well....... I'm not
buying yet !   I will check around more today.  I will post a resume of
what I have found when all is said and done and installed and paid for, ug!

Cheers,  (not so cheerful but trying hard)

Frank
