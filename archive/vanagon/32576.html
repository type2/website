Subject: Optima Batteries

Vanamaniacs,

With all the talk about batteries recently I thought I'd give some input on
the Optima battery.  I've seen this product at the car shows for a couple
years now, and it's intrigued me.  Here's what it is:

Available in 6V or 12V varieties.
Can operate in any position. Even upside down.
Constructed in such a way that the acid is held in pourous fiberglass floss,
wound with lead into cylindrical shaped cells.  3 cells in a 6V, 6 cells in
the 12V variety.
There is no free liquid in the battery.
They say 8-10 years of normal use, but offer only a 72 month warranty.
They also say this construction can take a lot of physical jolting (Syncro
owners?) and still hold up.
Fast charges _at_ 20Amps for 2-3/4 hours.
Completely sealed - no maintenance.

Specs:
12V: 
800CCA _at_ 0degF, 120 minute reserve capacity,
9-15/16&quot; long, 6-3/4&quot;wide, 7-13/16 high
Available in either top post only or dual post type that has normal top posts
and threaded hole type connections on the side.

6V: 
850CCA _at_ 0degF, 120 minute reserve capacity,
9-29/32&quot; long, 3-3/8&quot;wide, 7-13/16 high
Available in top post only.

Now, right off it appears that the 12V variety is too big for a Vanagon
under-seat mount. I did some measuring and it looks like if you used the dual
post variety, laid it on its side, cut off the &quot;normal&quot; posts, screwed in
some posts into the holes on the side, it might just fit.  I say might,
because by my measurements it was just too close to tell for sure.  I think
the only way to tell for sure is for someone to try it.

I'd like to see someone who needs a battery try this one out and report on
it.

I called the (714) area code phone number and was told that the Vanagon is
not on either their &quot;DOES FIT&quot; or &quot;does NOT fit&quot; lists.

I believe the 12V battery costs $150.

Please let the list know if someone checks this out.  Usual disclaimers - no
vested interest &amp; all.
