Subject: FTC arbitration info

For anyone who might be interested, I found some information on the
internet about the FTC arbitration program regarding VWs. The FTC's
web page is (guess what) www.ftc_dot_gov. If you select &quot;FTC ConsumerLine&quot;
then &quot;Publications&quot; then &quot;ConsumerLine Publication Index&quot; then &quot;Auto-
mobiles&quot; then &quot;VW Mediation/ Arbitration Program&quot;, you'll find info
about it. To go there directly, go to
 gopher://gopher.ftc_dot_gov:70/11/ConsumerLine/publications/automobiles/VW

This sounds like an interesting program that can have some real
benefits to those of us experiencing well-known and serious problems.
Of course, this program seems to be intended to handle cases where
working with a dealer hasn't given an owner the satisfaction he thinks
he deserves.
