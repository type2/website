Subject: Re: RE: #3 late timing.

&gt;that when timing a 1965 or later Bug, you will find that #3
&gt;cylinder is late firing while the other three seem to check
&gt;out.  Don't worry--it is supposed to be that way.  The
&gt;reason #3 cylinder is late firing as compared to the others
&gt;is that in 1965 Volkswagen gave a special grind to the cam
&gt;in the distributor to cause #3 to fire 2-1/2 degrees late.
&gt;This was done to aid cooling of #3 cylinder which is
&gt;farthest away from the fan.&lt;unquote&gt;

Just a technicality:
Actually the #3 cylinder runs hotter because the oil cooler is in the fan
housing and blocks the part of the cooling air.   This problem was addressed
in 1968 when the &quot;dog house&quot; fan housing was introduced.  The dog house moved
the cooler out of the way of the air flow to the cylinders.
