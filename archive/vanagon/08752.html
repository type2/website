Subject: Re: Thermostat Location?

Donald,

I already did replace the temperature gauge sending unit, as I mentioned 
in an earlier post.

I have not replaced the ECU sending unit, and will give that some 
attention.  As a minimum, I'll check the contacts on both.  I wish there 
were an easy way (without looking at the schematic yet, I can't tell) to 
do a continuity check, and in any case, I'd be loath to do a continuity 
check on the ECU piece without knowing what kind of current it can take.

I don't know if the fluid coming out of the radiator was cool or not, 
probably not, but remember, this problem is intermittent.  I can't think 
of any thing that will cause the engine to genuinely run hot sometimes 
without turning on the fan, assuming the fan works (which it seems to), 
except for an intermittent thermostat.  I agree, they dont' tend to be 
intermittent in my experience, either.

In any event, I at least know where the thermostat is located, so when I 
get around to replacing it I can do so.  I really need to get this thing 
running over the holidays, becuase I dont' have a place to work on it at 
night and it gets a little cold here in Iowa sometimes.  (There is a 
tractor in my shop, and someone said they hadn't seen a positive ground 
system for a long while so I won't boor you with the electrical system on 
this tractor - sufficie it to say it's 12 volt, at least &lt;g&gt;.

Thanks
