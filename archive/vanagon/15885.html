If you are looking for a place to simply park and sleep, my thumb rule is
select a spot where you &quot;blend in&quot;. I have found that in addition to hotel
parking lots, closed gas stations are a good spot to sleep.

The gas stations almost always have other vehicles on the lot so just park 
and sleep. When the workers arrive, just start her up and drive away.
