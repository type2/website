Subject: mileage

This is a little poll on Vanagon mileage.  My newly-acquired '82, 
whose engine was rebuilt about 3,500 miles ago and runs well, achieved an 
alltime high of 11.5 mpg this last week, up from 10.5.  The increase is 
attributed to boosting the tire pressure to 50psi all 'round (up about 14 
psi).  Virtually all my driving is in 1st-2nd-3rd gear in typical urban, 
stop-and-go traffic (in San Francisco, which also has a hill or two).  I 
understand that 10-11 mpg is not unreasonable under these conditions, 
even as tears well in my eyes at the modest numbers.  I have not had it 
on the freeway enough to get any highway figures. I've been using 87 
octane gas. How are the rest of you doing in the mileage catetory?  
Cheers, Art McGinn
