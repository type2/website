Subject:  Finally got my rebuild back.

I just got a factory rebuilt engine put back in my 91 Carat by the dealer and
noticed that the rpms are about 3000-3500 with the pedal to the floor.
Occasionally it will burst up to 4000-5000 , giving a sudden burst of power,
but then goes back doen to 3-4krpms..losing that burst of power...is this 
normal for rebuilts?...my original engine would stay at a high rpm when i floored it, until i would let up on the gas.....


On another note When I depress the brake pedal I notice a vibration comming
from the left front wheel....could it be that the rotors are uneven?? or
does it mean I need an allignment......I a set of after market rotors put on
last MAY, and was experiencing the problem before my engine rebuild....


Thanks in advance. John.
