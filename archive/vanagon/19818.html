&gt;the folks on the list, sorted by bus year ... just to let everyone know
&gt;who's got another bus just like their own.

&gt; 59 Microbus Kombi           Eric Bergstrom
&gt;EBERGSTR_at_MINES.COLORADO.EDU -V
&gt; 59 Microbus Double-door Pan David Easterwood     DEASTERW_at_SCT.EDU -V
&gt; 59 Microbus Single-cab Pick David Easterwood     DEASTERW_at_SCT.EDU -VX
&gt; 59 Microbus Single-Cab Pick Bob Kenyon           RRK_at_RAHUL.NET -V
&gt; 59 Microbus Single-cab Pick Jason Teets          SJTEETS_at_UNITY.NCSU.EDU -VX

Did I miss the class about what the &quot;switches&quot; mean after our addresses?
How come Jason and David get X's and I don't?

Bob (perplexed and confused)
