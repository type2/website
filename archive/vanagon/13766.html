  Although my bus is out of commission, a contingent of Kautzini are still 
  interested in attending the Red Rock bash, despite having to camp in a tent.

  What I want to know is: 

  Are we still welcome?

  Will we be teased incessantly for the entire weekend if we show up in a
  &lt;gag, retch&gt; Oldsmobile station wagon?

  If not, what foodstuffs on the potluck list are still needed?

  Is anyone thinking of bringing mountain bikes?

  How stupid would I be if I was to pretend I never saw those bits of metal,
  put fresh oil and filter on my bus and take it Red Rock anyway &lt;round trip
  750 miles&gt;?


  Dave
