I used to drive a '87 Turbo Diesel Westfalia in Germany. (I am living 
in the Seattle are now.)

Bjorn  (or any one else out there) - I own a non-turbo '82 diesel Vanagon. 
It's engine is the 1.6  4 cylinder diesel that goes into that same era
Rabbit/Jettas, about 52 HP.  It has an oil cooler that circulates engine
coolant around the oil in a heat exchanger located between the engine block
mount for the oil filter and the oil filter itself.  Radiator up front appears
to be pretty much full size across the opening behind the grill (30 to 36&quot;
??).

What can you tell me about the turbo version that you drove in Europe?  What
engine, the turbo version of the1.6 that was used in factory turbo Jettas? 
Any special cooling arrangements?  Any special engine compartment
arrangements?  American dealers  said a factory turbo Vanagon was not possible
due to cooling limitations.

Any considerations of the possiblity to special order parts/engine to convert
normal breathing to turbo diesel?

Thanks
Harvey
