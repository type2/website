&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;        Sorry if this is basic information, I just saw Fiel 
&gt;&gt; I have been making notes in my sketchbook (I often sketch when I 
watch TV
&gt;&gt; or whatever) whenever I see VWs in movies...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Here's what I've seen so far...
&gt;&gt; (This list isn't as cool as I'd like it to be, but who has time 
for this
&gt;&gt; stuff... ;]  )
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; *** Lots of screen time:
&gt;&gt; Tapeheads--the main characters drive around in a Thing
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Slackers--one of the charatcters takes some girls to a gig in 
his white
&gt; bus
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Fried Green Tomatos--what's her face rear-ends a red bug 
convertable
&gt;&gt; belonging to two young females
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; *** VW Sightings in movies (quick peeks...)
&gt;&gt; Broco Billy-- bug on the road after scene &quot;may I touch your breast...&quot;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Chuck Norris Film (title unknown) -- Chase scene, many Westfalias and a
&gt; bug
&gt;&gt; are featured in one chase seen, sumo wrestler type bad guy picks up bug
&gt;&gt; (literaly) and threatens driver
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Breaking Away--used car lot has two bugs for sale
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Dr. No--bug in parking lot at start of film
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Live and Let Die-- Bug on street in New Orleans funeral scene.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Bikini Car Wash (USA up all night movie...I love bad films...)--Cal type
&gt;&gt; bus gets hosed down by a couple of bimbos.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That's all I have for now.  If you ever see an aircooled in a movie, even
&gt;&gt; just for a second, please let me know....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; -one of the high school Surf dudes drives 
&gt;a splittie...
&gt;
&gt;...Uh....&quot;Herbie&quot;.... or is that too obvious
&gt;
&gt;There was some movie about a gang in L.A. &quot;Las Ondas&quot;, a gang member's 
&gt;brother drove a splittie...
