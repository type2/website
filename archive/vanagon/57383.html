&gt; 
&gt; oh, and I don't know if anyone mentioned this already or not - don't use your
&gt; oil fill cap to prop open the lisc plate door - It'll fall behind the bumper
&gt; and you'll spend a half an hour trying to fish it out.....  :&lt;)

Also.....dont lean over the engine (hatch off..) with the ONLY key in 
your mouth......it has a tendency to fall into teh depths and require 
MUCH soul (and other places) searching to find it again....:)

i think it took my cousin a month find it when he did that...(85 GL...)

but he biked to work anyhow..(lived in Jax FL....:)

sheesh..i am REALLy rambling today...
