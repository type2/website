&gt; you vanagon types know that the later vanagons have a tach as standard,
&gt; right? it might be possible to fit it to an earlier vanagon, and hand-wire
&gt; it to the coil and power/ground (instead of needing that printed-circuit
&gt; foil in the instrument pod).

FYI, you can fit an older unit with a clock and it will work.  The tach in
our 85 vanagon goes off the scale everytime the ignition is turned on.
VW wanted $250 for a new tach without the other parts.  For that amount of
money you can buy two 12K rpm monster racing tachs with recall.  The main
reason we replaced it to fix the odometers.  My father found an instument
cluster from another 85 but it had a clock.  We just swapped them around
and its been working fine.  The only thing I noticed it that the fuel guage
is more sensitive to fuel movement in the tank.
