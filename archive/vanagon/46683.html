Another argument that the anti-smog legislation isn't really about clean air
is the fact that some states (eg. CA) require you to have everything on the
car as far as emissions equipment that the car came with, regardless of
actual emissions level (as recently pointed out).  If it were really about
clean air, the tailpipe output would be the only thing they would be
concerned with.  What if I made my VW run CLEANER than it originaly did, like
with an EFI setup?  If anything, you should have the option of having your
car inspected for the original equipment OR doing a dyno test to prove your
car is clean.  (I could see a higher fee if you elected to have the dyno
test since the equipment to do it would be more expensive.)
