Subject: $1100 engine and  VT fast shuffle...
Date: Fri, 9 Feb 1996 22:27:24 -0500

	To address the first issue
		Fast German Auto has an ad in March VW Trends page 108..
	Wasserboxer long blocks
	New Heads
	New pistons &amp; cyls
	New Factory Bearings
	New Factory gasket kit
	Resurfaced flywheel

		$1599 exchange....  for '84 and up...

	for the '72 to '83 busses
	same parts with the exception of heads
		
		$750 exchange...


		Second issue...

	I have quite a bit of business with these guys in Westminster VT..
	for the most part they are very honest....
	However, the guy who works the counter most of the time is NOT the 
	owner... he is given a price list to go by...
	The Owner on the other hand does whatever he damn well pleases!!
	I've had the same thing happen to me there...
	only I drive over an hour to pick up the parts...
	and I have walked out of there when I felt he was gauging me!

	Counter guy quotes one price, Owner decides he wants a few more 
	bucks for the weekend...  mail-order customer gets the shaft...
	
	After reading all the feedback today, I called over there and told them 
	that they are on the verge of losing well over 500 potential customers 
	over this!

	don't know if this will do any good, but I told them I won't be buying 
	anything from them till this gets straightened out...
	
	Most of the folks who work there are very much VW enthusiasts...
	The owner used to be.... now Money is his primary motivation...

	Sad state of affairs that is becoming very prevalent in our Hobby/ Way 
	of Life...

		Nuff Said...
