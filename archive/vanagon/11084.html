Subject: Re:  Window Tinting

After tinting a Toyota sedan and a Blazer, I realized that tinting is a real 
skill.  I took my beloved bus to a shop and paid (not an unreasonable 
amount either) to get some one who knew what the Hades he was doing to do a 
really good job.  That's the route I would advise for anyone unless you 
really really like to do close careful work.  I had gutted the interior as 
part of a rehab roject and decided to do it right while the interior was 
totally bare.  I do not regret it!

As for color/shade, I asked for and got &quot;limo&quot; tint.  It's darker than 60% but 
still within legal limits for Tennessee/Georgia as long as the certification sticker the shop put 
between the window and film is intact.  I like the looks as well as the 
privacy the tinting gives.  Tinting was just too much of a hassle when a 
good shop could do a reasonably priced job in only a couple of hours.
