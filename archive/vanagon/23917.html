Subject: Ohio Junkyard near Marietta on I77?

Does anyone know the name and phone number of this yard, or any
other yard in Ohio that specializes in VW's? I've been told about
this place by several friends that have driven past it. It's north
(?) of Marietta Ohio off I77. You can see it from the freeway.
There aren't any VW's left in the yards in NE Ohio. We live on top
of 2 salt mines here, so it is used in large amounts on the roads
here. Most old cars die of cancer, the bodies rot off of the
frames before the engines die in many cases. So, the old VW's
dissapeared from junkyards a long time ago.

Thanks,

Lisa
