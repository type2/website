&gt; that boasted 10% increases in Hp and mpg.

Maybe on an engine that was out of tune and running poorly.

&gt;  It was a Jacobs system.  I asked an avionics engineer who has also done a 
&gt; beautiful job restoring a mustang about it and he gave Jacobs a high 
&gt; credibility rating but didn't have any experience (first or second hand) 
&gt; with the Jacobs ignition system.
&gt; 
&gt; Can any of the list members pass on any info, mainly experiences, about the 
&gt; Jacobs?

No personal experience, but over on the Fordnatics list, Jacobs' claims
have been refuted.  If it were possible to get those kinds of increases
in HP and MPG, don't you think VW would have done it?  Good topic for
discussion, perhaps.
