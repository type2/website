Subject: Coolant Problem Question

Just picked up my $150.00 '87 Wolfsburg from NYC.  Made it home (2 
hrs plus) fine, but near the end the temp light was flashing and I 
noticed that coolant was filling up in the overflow (which had been 
nearly empty at the start of the trip). Temp guage never went above 
half way, though, and motor ran fine. Radiator felt fairly cool 
just 20 minutes after the long drive, indicating (I suppose) a 
circulatory problem.  P.O. told me this had happened before, only 
after long drives, and that even with continued driving the while 
the light was flashing the van had never overheated.  I am assuming 
a very minor head gasket leak.  Anyone have any different ideas?  
Also, since this van probably will never again be driven long 
enough for the problem to resurface, is there any way of testing 
for the cause when the symptom is NOT occuring at the time?
