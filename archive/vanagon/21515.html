Subject: trans lube

I just the last 45 min carassing/fondling/drooling over my rebuilt transaxle
that I have been waiting for for about a week.  West coast to east UPS! 
It looks almost too nice to install.  Anywho - what oil should I use?
Transform (the comp. I bought it from) suggested regular hypoid (90W).
 
	SInce I had the engine out, I took of the heads.  I was concerned
about the intake valve on #3 sitting a little lower than the other valves.
Actual adjustment indicated this valve was below the valve spring washer.
The valve checked out ok.  On the other side I passed an accelerator tube from
the carb thru the intake and into the #1 cylinder.  How I know is that I
flattened the spark plug.  This also checked out ok.  Compression is/was 
120 - 130 all around.  Now that I've done this, I need to torque the heads
back on.  What should the head bolts be torque to?  TIA
