Hi Eddie, Hi All

I've found that changing the generater/alternator in an upright engine
isn't much trouble if you reach around behind the fan shroud and unbolt the
fan from the generator before removing anything else.  this gives you
enough clearance to remove the generator w/o pulling the fan shroud.  Still
need to pull the carb though.
