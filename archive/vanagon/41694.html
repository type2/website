&gt; Sachs makes VW parts in BRAZIL???

That's what the box says.  White and blue Sachs box, hecho en Brazil. 
The guy who ordered them for me hadn't seen it before either.  Isn't 
it the case that some of the original manufacturing equipement from 
Germany was once shipped to Brazil?  I would guess that this is why 
some parts seem to be the same as their German counterparts and others
are not.  Jim
