&gt;   A general rule of thumb is if you are going over 50 mph and more than 50
&gt;   miles than the transmission end of things should be raised off the
&gt;   ground; otherwise putting the trans in neutral should work. OTOH, I have
&gt;
In 87, (I remember the date: April 18, 1987), I towed my '74 bug about
400 miles with the front end on the car dolly, orwhatever they call it,
and the transmission in neutral.  U-Haul tried to get me disconnect the
shafts, but I was too lazy.

Maybe I was lucky, nothing that I could notice happened to the transmission.
or any other part of  the drivetrain...
