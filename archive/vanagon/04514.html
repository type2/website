Subject: Anyone in Baltimore?



Hi VintageVW and Vanagon,

I'm going to Baltimore MD tomorrow for a meeting and will be there
until Friday morning, staying at the Omni Inner Harbor Hotel.  Are there
any VW lovers on either of these lists in Baltimore?  Want to join me
and my cronies for dinner sometime this week?

Are there any VW events in MD this Sunday? (wishful thinking)

Cheers,

 -Dyer
