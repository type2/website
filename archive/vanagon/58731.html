&gt; Westy doesn't have the 3rd brakelight.  What do you think about adding one
&gt; in the back window?  How hard is it to do?

How about some city lights.  Neuspeed sells em for about 25.00.  They
are easy to pop in and wire to the parking lights.  They look awesome. 
They are used in Europe and are called &quot;Standlicht&quot; I believe.  People
use them when they are parked on the curb for short periods of time.
