Thanks to everyone for the advice.  I got the wires all hooked up then I
checked the points; they were totally fried!  The wire coming to the points
that connected to the condenser was a pile of ash!  So I replaced the
points, condenser and cap (my FLAPS didn't have the right rotor), tured the
key and she started instantly.  YAAAAA!  Now I have to get that one lifter
to quiet down.
Thanks again to everyone who helped!
