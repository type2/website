&gt;about $10 a tube at your local dealer, or use part store Moly EP
&gt;for a lot less but does it work?

i've had good success with Valvoline MOLY EP wheel bearing grease (for
disc brake wheel bearings) in the paper tube ... about $1.50 per tube.
i've got 96,000 miles on these joints now, and only cleaned/regreased them
at 75,000 cause i got paranoid. ;) but i did add extra grease when i bought
the car (at about 500 miles). other buses also lasted past 100,000 on the
same grease.

however ... :(  this grease will LEAP off the joints onto your shirt, face,
hands, arms, neck, nose, and any other nearby expanse of human flesh or
&quot;good&quot; clothing.
