&gt; It appears to me, on my tiny 13-inch set, that the vehicle that got
&gt; pancaked just prior to the motorhome was a vanagon.  It got pushed
&gt; a hundred yards or so before being stopped by the motorhome, otherwise
&gt; it might have got away.  David Schwarze?

I saw that clip, and it was indeed a Vanagon.  The way it looked to me,
the Vanagon was parked a couple of car lengths in front of the motorhome.
The tank was doing about 30mph down a side street and veered over next to
the curb striking the Vanagon head on.  The vanagon was pushed into (and
when I say INTO I mean INTO!) the Motorhome and then the tank rolled over
both of them.  It was more like an explosion - spontaneous vanagon combustion
 - he hit them so hard.  That vanagon didn't have a prayer, even if the
motorhome hadn't been there it woulda been toast.  They said a total of 35
vehicles were destroyed along with 8 traffic signs and 5 fire hydrants.
