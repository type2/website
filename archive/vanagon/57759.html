Subject: magnesium smoke inhalation?

 &gt;&gt; Is breathing the smoke from a magnesium fire for certain harmful?  I
 don't think anyone in our group can be accused of inhaling the stuff
 on purpose or in large quantities, but I&quot;m sure some of it gets into
 our lungs simply because we breathe it in the air so close to
 the fire.  &lt;&lt;


 You're not throwing old VW engine case halves on the fire now, are you?
