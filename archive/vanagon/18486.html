Subject: Re: Front shocks for a '71 bus

Hi Mitch -

This problem with the shock stud with the sleeve of the old shock is a
constant thing we put up with here at Bus Boys when we disassemble complete
beams for adjuster installations.  Yes, you do have to remove this sleeve
even if you're just replacing the shocks with OEM Stock (UGH) shocks.  

The problem is that after time, the sleeve on the shock bushing just rusts
and freezes to the stud - it also does the same on the upper tower mount as
well, but not as often.

Trivia note -  the bottom stud was increased in length beginning with the
1970 model year.

Solution - a little bit of grease (Mos2 added wouldn't hurt either) on the
stud mount and on the upper bolt will help tremendously when you have to
remove them down the road for other time-consuming maintenance elsewhere on
the front end.  I have these KG4521 shocks on a '67 Bus Deluxe (I'm original
owner) and a '73 panel as well as other KYB's on my '80 Vanagon.

Hope this helps.

:-)  Jim  -  Bus Boys
