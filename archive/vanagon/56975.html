Gary:

&gt;&gt;.  Two people can sleep in the back  table/fold down bed. &lt;&lt;

   This layout seats four up front. Two other alternatives seat just two
up front  with either twin beds or a double bed in the rear.  In this
floorplan, the galley is behind the driver, and on the opposite side,
behind the passenger seat  is a pull -up table and swivel chair for
dining.
 
&gt;&gt;  I won't even talk about the $73,000 the guy paid for it.  I'd rather
buy 6 more Syncros...one for each day of the week. &lt;&lt;

   This seems way too high to me.   Last year at a boat/van/camping show,
1996's were priced at around $45,000.  As with cars, RV prices are
negotiable.  Haven't seen the 97 yet, since it's a foot longer I'd expect
some interior changes, and of course a price increase!
