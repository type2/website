David C. points out:
&gt;Trouble is the
&gt;dual sender is a bugger to install, necessitating some snippage of the tin
&gt;and a deft hand in threading the sender.

I actually put in a T. It sticks right up behind (actually, in front of
-- FIF) the distributor and there's no need to snip the tin. Moreover, the
T allows me to keep the OEM pressure sender.
