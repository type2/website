Subject: Great Deals On Inverters

I plan to buy this afternoon an inverter from Shoppers Advantage/CUC.

I have identified the PC600 Focus Industries model as the best value for
general purpose use. The prices are unbelievable. Here's what I see:

PC 300 $55
PC 600 $158
PC 1500 $358

The current All Electronics Corp. closeout catalog shows these same
inverters for double the price so I know this is a great deal. 

If anyone has advice on why *not* to proceed with this purchase please post
the reason right away.

If your budget is unlimited get instead a nice Heart Interface model for
$800 to $2,000, depending on the wattage. This is what I plan to do in a
couple of years.

The only hitch might be that these inverters don't say what kind of wave
they have. I assume we are talking about a modified sine wave but for all I
know these are square wave inverters, which would be a disaster I guess. I
wonder when it would make sense to pay up for a true sine wave.

Can the prior posters on these things offer up any further comments/insights?
