Subject: Different motor in my '79 Westy?

Hi folks.  I'm new to this group, and maybe I'm just looking to get flamed
here, but I'm pondering an alternate power source for my '79 Westfalia.  The
current motor has lasted for 189,000 miles.  It isn't broken, but I was
getting some of that type 1 sounding rod knock when cold, and it's
compression is very low (I can push it across the parking lot when it's in
gear).  We love our bus, and it is not for sale.  I've built two type I
motors (one stock, one not so stock), and I am not afraid of the type IV,
but it is going to cost a lot of money.  For starters, the '79 bus and '80
vanagon are supposedly the only years that used &quot;square&quot; exhaust ports, and
that makes heads and heater boxes harder to find.
30,000 miles ago I was thinking about buying a long block from Stephens
Machine in CA.  I would have spent about $1800 exchange by the time I got a
clutch and new hoses,wires, etc.
BUT, I can get a Jetta (rabbit) motor from Bry's (Seattle) for $400-600
including computer,harness, everything (in fact they said they would sell me
the whole front half of the car so I would have it all).  Of course I can
get an adapter kit from Kennedy for $490.  That leaves me fabricating a rear
motor mount, radiator shrouding, exhaust system, and heating system.  I am a
CNC programmer at a very diverse machine shop, so none of this will be a big
(or expensive)problem.  I am not particularly bothered by computer
controlled cars (it's computer controlled right now), as they are easier to
diagnose than any points/twin carb car ever hoped to be.  I can't use an
older type I motor as people in rec.vw's suggested because I have to go
through smog testing.  The engine has to be same year or newer to be legal.
The rabbit motors are very tough, rev freely and are cheap.  So far response
from others has been favorable, but I haven't spoke to anyone who has
actually done it.  The guy at Kennedy that I spoke to said the one he drove
was very fast (he admitted he drove it hard), and that was witha stock 1.6
liter.  I know it's blasphemy to suggest a water cooled motor, but at least
I'm staying in the family :)
I read the FAQ that described the Porsche transplant.  It's intresting
reading, but those motors are prohibitively expensive, and the cooling tin
would be a real headache.  I did see a picture of a Porsche powered bus with
its front wheels at least two feet in the air once.  Anybody know if that's
possible?
Please flame me day or night...
