&gt; You think so? It seems like it costs about $1000 to get an estimate around
 here. I've heard so many horror stories about body shops......Probably
 shouldn't have let Thom know how much I had to spend, huh? There goes my
 good deal...

 Sorry to burden the list with this, I meant to email Thom directly.


&gt; &gt;   The paint above the beltline is original VW and is in good shape. I have 
&gt; &gt;   about $1000.00 to spend on this work. A June/July timeframe would work 
&gt; &gt;   Dave
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; By all means let Thom give it a go, but hell $1000 should get the
&gt; work done professionally and at fairly good quality in urethane at
&gt; that.
