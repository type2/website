Subject: More HP Stories?

joel...my mech has a Synchro and is looking for ways to get more HP out of
his stock engine. I've got archived all that stuff that you mentioned. Thanx
for the offer anyway.
 
I saw this ad on TV recently for the Split Fire spark plugs which &quot;claimed&quot;
up to 5 HP more among other stuff. Do they have them for VW busses? I'm kind
of leary about those claims. Has any one tried them?
 
I remember putting straight thru Thrush mufflers on my 56 Chevy to get more
power by lessening the back pressure on the exhast. Some guys even put
dumper valves at their header ports to get even more power. I never measured
the HP but it seemed to have more power. Does Thrush have mufflers for VW
busses?
 
This is the kind of stuff I guess he is looking for for his Synchro in
particular. If anyone's got something they've tried especially on their
Synchro that seemed to work, please tell us your story.  Thanx...Joey
