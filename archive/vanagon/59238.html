Subject: TGIF: The Show (song parody)

Original Lyrics : Phil Collins
Original Music  : Phil Collins
Album           : ... But Seriously

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

All across the nation
Buses are driving
Going to shows.
Winning awards,
Making their owners so proud

Up upon the judge-stand
Decisions are making
of which bus is best
It's very hard
To decide which gets first place

Tell me, what do you say
Tell me, when shall we go?
You will surely enjoy yourself
At the VW trade show

As we drive down the highway
See the heads turning
Toward our bus
See those wide eyes
A Jetta goes by, driver smiles

Tell me, what do you say ...

All our friends are coming back
Look at the buses everywhere
But what I don't see is why
it rained today, not yesterday
But the judges don't care

Our new rustproofing will relieve you
This bus ain't gonna rust
It can rain all it wants, it can thunder
But I spent the cash
and bought the best

No matter what you say, this bus will always get better
No matter where you go, it can drive you anywhere

Look at that split to the right -
Ain't it something to see?
Or that loaf camper on the left
It really appeals to me

You can talk Cabriolets
You can show Beetles of all kinds
But when I drive VWs
And engines start running
The Bus is always mine

No matter what you say ...

(instrumental)

What makes you so high and mighty?
What makes you so qualified
To think Bugs are the best
When you've driven my Camper
And seen my adoring eyes

Now we've impressed the judges
With the work we did ourselves
Someday soon this bus is gonna win
And be the talk of the show

No matter what you say ...
