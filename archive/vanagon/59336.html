&lt;&lt; After having my Westie checked out I discovered the gas tank seals and
hoses
 are leaking. The mechanic said that he has seen and increase in this since
 California
 has switched to new reformulated gasoline. (The additives in the gas have a
 knack for eating certian plastics and rubber.)
 
 So, for those of you who live in California, you might want to keep an eye
on
