[Steve's trip narrative deleted]

&gt; Delorto's.  De-Lux sleeping accomodations.  Our thanks again to John
&gt; Surfer-Dude for his exceptional hospitality.  I recommend that if 
&gt; you're going to be in the area to let John know.  I don't mean this 
&gt; to be an open invitation to his house.  That's obviously up to him. ;)
&gt; 

Let me make that official: if you're travelling and think you're going to be
in the neighborhood of Corvallis, Oregon then drop me a line and maybe we can
get together.  It was fun having Steve and Linda drop by and would be fun to
see other NetVolk in person.  More on this later...  but, barring previous
engagements, y'all are always welcome to drop by.

I just got back from a little jaunt in Bobo myself.  Took 4 days down in
Ashland to watch plays at the Shakespeare festival there.  Saw 2
fantastic plays (Much Ado About Nothing and the Tempest) and a so-so
Hamlet.  Camped out in the Bus but ate, drank and was extremely merry in
town!  Bobo did well, hauling me and a friend up hill and down at _at_70
MPH all the way down there and back, plus taxiing a bunch of us in and
out between town and the campground.  He (my bus) felt quite at home in
Ashland seeing gobs of his cousins, some of which were in really great
shape.  My friends did get tired of me saying &quot;Wow! look at that
21-window!&quot; or &quot;Nice paint on that Westy!&quot; and were making fun of me by
the end, but they were also noticing `em by then so the indoctrination
was successful (hehheh!).

I was dismayed to find nearly 400 email messages waiting for me when I got
back, though, and 85% from this list!  What a bunch of yacking fools we are!
;-)

Later,
John
