Subject: Re: hot water help

My plan was to keep the water temp below 110 degrees to minimize scalding 
risk and to prevent damage to the plastic tank. Most of the plastic in the 
Vanagon gets at least that hot when it's parked.

My previous attempts to use the engine heat failed--I was unable to 
control the heat and the water got much too hot.

I want to use the existing tank to save space and weight.
