Tom -

Had a similar experience with my 80 Wanagon I recently sold.  After
owning it for one year, it just got plain noisy as hell, change in gear
oil, even heavier made no difference (Over 130,000 miles)

Don't know of any rebuilders good or bad, in the bay area.  My suggestion
is to get a rebuilt unit from Carter's Gear Box Shop out of Big Bear Lake
in  Southern California.  I've been dealing with them personally for many
years and they do their trannies right THE FIRST TIME.  And they really
know their stuff when doing the typical FAQ on the phone.

In fact, I'm getting ready to order a center section replacement for my
62 Beetle Sedan (it's noisy too).

Talk to Harold or his wife Glynnis 909-866-2221 or FAX 909-866-6224

&gt;Hi all:
&gt;
&gt;Last week my transmission started making a howling or whining noise 
&gt;(not 
&gt;too bad yet) in 1st and 2nd gear.  Not surprising since the trans has 
&gt;more than 200,000 miles on it.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, a few questions:
&gt;
&gt;Any experience or anectdotes about how long from the time you start 
&gt;hearing these noises until the trans self-destructs?
&gt;
&gt;It doesn't seem likely that changing the trans oil, even to a heavier 
&gt;weight, would much improve things.  Anybody have any contrary 
&gt;opinions?
&gt;
&gt;I guess rebuilding these things is beyond the realm of possibilities 
&gt;for 
&gt;the home mechanic, so does anybody have a good recommendation for 
&gt;trans 
&gt;rebuilders in the SF Bay Area?
&gt;
