Subject: Re: taking the alternator out

     Tonya,
     
     I just replaced my alternator this summer, it is a very easy 
     procedure.
     
     There are only two bolts holding it on.  It's a simple as that.  I 
     believe that I had to get mine off to check the carbon brushes on the 
     regulator.  You can tell if they need replacing by checking that they 
     make good contact and there is no obvious pitting on the stator (I 
     think) where the brushes make contact.  Apparently the worn brushes 
     are the most common fault and the cheapest fix.  Again it's as easy as 
     two screws.
     
     I beleive the bently says that you can remove the brushes without 
     removing the alternator, but I don't think I could've.  At any rate, 
     it's an easy fix.
     
     The only thing to be sure of if tightening/over-tightening the belt 
     when replacing the alternator.  You want it tight enough such that you 
     can twist the belt about a half turn in either direction.  Over 
     tightening the belt will cause premature bearing failure in the alt.  
     Loose alt - well should be obvious.
     
     There are no hidden tricks.  Just be sure that if you replace it you 
     get the 90-amp alternator, and I reccommend going German, even though 
     the Bosch alt is very spendy.
     
     Good luck and I hope this helps.

1)  Is there a simple way of removing the regulator/brushes without 
removing the whole alternator?
     
2)  If not, or just incase they are fine and the alternator itself is 
bad, What is the best way to remove the alternator?
