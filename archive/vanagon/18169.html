A.C.,

You left out the 8 and 14 volt batteries you run into at high latitudes.

Cells in the same case are 'formed' or made electrically active at virtually
the same moment.  A pair of identical batteries from the same manufacturing
batch are often used in series with good results.  But often not.  The
difficulty has to do with what's called 'local action' within the individual
cells; it is the reason batteries 'wear out'.

The best way to gain a better understanding of the point I tried
(unsuccessfully) to make, is to select two batteries, charge them, and log
their normal discharge curve over a 30 day period.   Then recharge them,
cable them in series and perform the same test.  The results will defy
Conventional Wisdom. 

Or you may wish to refer to literature from any of the sources I cited.  

-Bob
