Subject: Re: Printed Circuit Foil



I have heard, but have had no first hand experience, that a skilled 
solderer can repair the printed foil circuit.

Would be best to practice on a trashed one. 

I have seen apparently usable ones at junkyards. If they need any repair 
its probably just led and voltage stabilizer replacement.
