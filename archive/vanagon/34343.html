&gt; Subject: headliner source in Virginia?

&gt; In the Sept/Oct issue of OBR Jim (Bryant) mentioned a source for
&gt; quality headliners in an article he wrote for Typing 2 Ink.

&gt; Was wondering if anyone knew the name of the source he refered to?

Kevin,

I've been called a lot of strange things in my life, but
this is the first time anyone referred to me as Old Bus Rat
Jim :) Probably appropriate, though.

I had to go back and check my records and track down the
catalog.  They still advertise in DB&amp;HVWs, mostly for bugs
and Ghias, and want $3.00 for a catalog:

V-Dub Restoration Parts
7921 Broad Street Complex
Richmond, Virginia 23229

(804) 747-0198
