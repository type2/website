I have that bad gas smell at the rear of my '77 camper and the top 
gasket or grommet at the filler/gas cap holder is cracked. Would anyone 
happen to know where I might be able to order a replacement? My usual 
source of California Imports in B.C. doesn't have their type II 
catalog done yet. 

			Thanks
