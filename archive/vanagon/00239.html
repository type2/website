Subject: Public thank you



A &quot;mailing-list&quot; thank you to Joel Walker for sending me
the Vanagon parts fiche...

I wish there was something I could give you in return...
Maybe a Convex supercomputer or MPP so we could track
all the parts that have been replaced *instead* of the
ECU to fix the surge problem. Somebody *has* to be 
making money on this...

I saw somebody from Tandem on this list..maybe Tandem 
can send them instructions on how to make ECUs that are
non-stop...
