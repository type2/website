re: initial gathering, earlier post from peter sellers

UMMMMM!
I hate to be to be the bearer of bad tidings but Jacques on Wilson blvd will 
be closed this Sunday as they are on all Sundays.    I just called and 
verified.

Peter --- I haven't heard back from you on a reschedule for our initial bang 
our heads together how do we go about this gathering.
