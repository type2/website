good point. i should point out that the big mutha cable i added was JUST
a ground cable, nothing to do with the positive cable. i also did NOT
change any of the original stuff ... like Dan says, it just adds a direct
path for the ground (and gets rid of some of the voltage drop).

another point to make is that if you are experiencing some dim headlights
in your older buses, you might want to try running a larger additional
ground wire from the negative battery terminal directly to the headlights
... again, to reduce the voltage drop. it gives brighter headlights at
very little cost.
