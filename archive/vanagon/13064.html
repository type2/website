Subject: `63 singlecab ?'s: an unusual VW find...

Ok, today (Sunday) I was following up on the many rumors that I tend
to follow up on; (I have nothing better to do at the moment), and I 
found the following: a 1963 Single cab for 100.00!!! Here is the list
of possible problems that I can see: (I'm not quite sure of what to
inspect on a singlecab, so bear with me.)
Pretty severe front end damage. (floorboards crushed, noseskin damaged
probably beyond repair...seller will give me noseskin, gratis.)
Bottom of bed rotted out--underneath looks solid. (I can get 4x6 sheets
of the bed material for about 25.00--WCM, or Brasillian, I believe. 
welding it/doing bodywork myself is no prob.) The floor on the under-
the bed cubbyhole is also rotted. Both these problems are pretty common
here in WA.
Some minor repair on the gates needed. (They're all there, just minor rust.)
Rear taillights--what should they look like? I see the stock `63 lights,
(Bus), and about 2&quot; to the upper right (passenger side), and 2&quot; to the upper
left (driver's), a round light. Is this supposed to be there?
Rear corners, lower--both need replaced. Is there a source for these? (I'll
check with my FLAPS tomorrow.)
No motor, transaxle
Wheelwells have been cut out. (ARRRGH!!!!!)
PROS:
Except for the bed, very little rust.
He will sell me a good transaxle for 200$
He will give me a good noseskin, gratis (free.)
He will give me good bumpers. (The front was damaged.)
I recently stripped a `63 kombi, and it looks like most stuff will fit,
even though it's 80% complete. (Lenses, etc.)
Enough about this! About what else he has:
`56 kombi
`58 23-window deluxe (SOLD!!! To my brother!!!)
2x6X deluxes
2X5X-6X kombis
Assorted Ghias (1964-1974)
Seven (Yes, seven (7)) Oval windows in various states of strippedness--
he even has a `54 body (w/semaphores!), and a `56 convertible bug.
`58 ragtop bug (And `58 sedan, for parts)
`62(?) ragtop, complete
`67 vert, with `67 sedan for parts.
Far too many parts for everything you can think of. He just got rid of
a few (He said about 3.) BARNDOORS! ARRGH!!!
Some of this isn't for sale, but most is. If anyone is in desperate need
of parts for some older stuff, email me, but remember this guy is about
130 miles away from me! I'm going there next Saturday, I think, and
buying the `63--as Thom's .sig sometimes says: `It's easier to get
forgiveness than permission!' :)
