Subject: Re[4]: Which is the outside lane?



&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought the question was:&quot;Which is the outside lane?&quot;, not, which is
&gt;&gt;&gt;the fast/slow lane.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;OK, then... the outside lane is the one I'm not in!
&gt;
&gt;Is there an outside chance that this is an inside joke?

In a roundabout way, probably so.
At least, *I* sure haven't figured out what the original poster was
talking about!
