This is just a test of the Vanagon Mailing List System.  If this had been a
real message, information of vital importance concerning Volkswagen Type IIs
would have been transmitted.  But then again, probably not!  Remember, this
is only a test!

P.S.
Actually I hadn't got any mail today (unusual) and was wondering if the
system was down.
