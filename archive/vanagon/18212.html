WHHHAAAAA!!!!  I WANNA GO!!!  I am soooo jealous of you CA folks!  
I know, it's _only_ 2000 miles from here. :-{  One o' these days...
DO have fun in the spirit of our fine discussions.  
At least I get to go to the BBTA for a Bon_Voyage to the GNATT..:))
Wish I could take a month off and go with them.  WORK IS A CRIME	 
AGAINST HUMANITY!! And the GNATT!  Grumble Grumble... 
 
  You don't have to be 2000 miles away to gnash your teeth!!!
  If this is an annual thing I need to plan ahead... make the
  500 mile drive next time, back to back sales meetings or no!!!
  Oh well... maybe I'll pile the family in the Westy and putt to
  the local playground for a picnic instead...
