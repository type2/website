Subject: best spotlight for Vanagons

Vanagons are good for adventuring, and it often happens that you want to see
off to the side of the road at night, for example to read street signs, or
in my case, to look far up a bad road to gague how much trouble I will get
in (ie, how many hours it will take me to get unstuck) for driving in.

Many catalogs feature these hand held spotlights you can use, including
Danmark and other catalogs. After a great deal of research I have detrmined
that the brightest spotlight is probably the Q-Beam Million Max model sold
by the Brinkmann Corporation (214-387-4939). 

This unit, with 1 million candlepower, is brighter than my headlights and
illuminates whole buildings at a shot. It is killer. The secret is the xenon
gas bulb, which is much brighter than halogen. It operates off 12 volts, and
plugs in the cigg lighter.

It is available from K-Mart of all places, for around $35. I am writing to
recomend that any list member who has wanted a spotlight get this particular
model and not go through the research process that I did.
