                      RE&gt;&gt;Cinderblock thru Van window              10/31/95

&gt;the latch is loose so i have to
&gt;pull the latch up into the groove and hope that noone can get around it and
&gt;thus get into my beloved bus.  I was wondering if anyone knows what to do,
&gt;how can i tighten the latch, it slips around on the glass??

=================================
Been there, done that - here's the scoop.

the latch on the slider windows has about 7 pieces:
1)  The vertical sliding piece on the inside that you move to engage/disengage
the latch
2)  A hidden screw, slotted, that is accessed via a hole in the bottom of part
#1 above.  This screw holds piece #1 in place.
3)  A spring that the screw #2 above compresses, it gives the thrust to keep
piece #1 in the &quot;up&quot; position
4) &amp;5)  Two screws, hidden under piece #1, that go through the glass and into
the small metal plate on the outside of the window #6)
6)  The metal plate on the outside of the window
7) a thin metal &quot;rubber&quot; gasket between piece #6 and the glass.

It is the screws, #s 4 &amp;5, that keep the entiere latch assembly from sliding
around on the glass.  I think that at least piece #6 is just die cast pot
metal or some other soft metal.  You access these screws by unscrewing screw
#2 and removing it and the spring, and removing piece #1.  I find the best
tool to use to get this screw out is a an offset screwdriver, that is shaped
like a &quot;Z&quot;.  It is a slow process, about a half turn at a time.  A VERY long
thin screw driver may also work.

Once you have the two anchoring screws exposed, you can try to tighen them,
but be careful, they strip easily (don't ask how I know).  
If this doesn't do it, or if the threads are stripped, having been there, I
can tell you that attempting to glue pieces # 6 &amp; 7 to each other and the
glass, even with &quot;Crazy Glue&quot; or other similar high strength adhesives won't
work.  What I did was drill through the old threaded holes, rethread and use
longer screws that threaded into piece #6's new threads.  I tightened this
&quot;just enough&quot; and then used an additional pair of nuts on the OUTSIDE of piece
#6 to double lock the screws. Cut/file off any extra protruding threads so
they are flush with the new nuts.   I also used &quot;Loctite&quot; on all threads.  A
quick coat of black paint over the exterior pieces (Brass hardware for the
screws and nuts is recommended).

This repair has held very well for about a year or more.  This is on the
window on the sliding door, and it gets a lot of use by the kids (read as - 
those who aren't particularly careful or delicate about how they operate
things).
