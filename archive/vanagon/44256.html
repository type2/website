Subject: re: Vanagon from hell


&gt;
&gt;Well, I picked up my wheels last fri. from the the mechanic for my
&gt;new rebuilt transmission.  All ran great, felt fine. and is.  This morning
&gt;on my way into work the starship began sputtering, while I'm pumping
&gt;the accelerator and no gas getting to the engine.  It stalls so I coast to
&gt;the side.  It starts so I go about half a mile and same thing.  Must be
&gt;the fuel pump is my guess.  So it's at the place it spends more time
&gt;at than in my driveway - the mechanic.  This could really jeapordize
&gt;the CCC trip :(  So far in the last year I've had to replace the Trans, 
&gt;clutch, master cylinder, and now probably the fuel pump?  Not much
&gt;else to do but a rebuild
&gt; 
Jeez--complain, complain, complain.

In the last two years I have put new brakes, new tires, a new A/C compressor
with one new hose, a new distributor, a new radiator, a new fuel pump, a new
ignition coil and a new (remanufactured) engine--almost forgot about my new
shocks.  I'm probably leaving out something even with that long list.  I
must admit--it does run great now, and I haven't soured on my decision.  I
still love my van.

I only paid $2,200 for my '85 Vanagon and it does have 151,000 miles on it
now.  Nothing from the above list has surprised or shocked me.  I figure
eventually I will have caught up to its several previous owners lack of care
for it and I'll get around to having the dents banged out of it and have it
painted.  It still costs me less to own than my long lost '92 Passat
Variant. :-)

Happy motoring!
