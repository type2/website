Subject: Any suggestions for keeping an 85 Westi alive &quot;forever&quot;

I've just acquired an 85 Westi that after a month of intense work/expense
is in showroom condition. I've done all that I can think of to keep it
alive for the forseeable future. Any suggestions from long time Westi
owners would be very appreciated. i.e. maint intervals, suggested fluids,
etc. I'd like to be pro-active rather than waiting for things to break/wear
out.

Thanks in advance!!!
