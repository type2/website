&gt; &gt;Hi Daniel,
&gt; &gt;I just installed an Eberspaecher BN2 underneath my '76 Camper.
&gt; 
&gt; I also
&gt; &gt;have the installation instructions, owners manual and trouble
&gt; shooting guide.
&gt; &gt;If anybody wants a copy of those, please let me know.......
&gt; 
&gt; If you can scan the pertinent photos/illustrations,
&gt; I'm sure someone would be only too happy to
&gt; incorporate them into a T2 web site...

Should somebody have the need, I have also written up my experiences with 
installing a BN-2 heater under the rear seat of my '80 Vanagon. Feel free 
to e-mail me for details.
