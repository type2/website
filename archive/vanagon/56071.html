Subject: Successful fan motor repair (Jetta)

Hi all,

Just thought I'd share my experience with repairing my Jetta heater 
fan motor last weekend, since it *may* help with other VWs also.

It's been squeaking for a year or two now, but working fine, so I'd 
usually just pull it &amp; put some motor oil on the bushing/shaft &amp; pop 
it back in. (Much in contrast to a Vanagon, this takes &lt; 2 minutes, 
with no tools needed).
It was to the point where a drop of oil would stop the squeak for a 
day or two, so I finally tore into the motor.

To get it apart basically requires popping the crimped joints in the 
housing, which at first appears to destroy it, but in fact does not, 
if done carefully. After pulling the shaft &amp; checking the brushes, 
which were in good shape (amazingly, at 370k), I noticed the copper 
contact area is about twice as wide as the brushes, and a nice groove 
was worn into it. I carefully slide the whole winding assembly on the 
shaft to make the brushes wear on a new area, and cleaned the copper 
with emory paper.
I then polished the shaft surface which rides in the bushings with 
emory paper, then reassembled with a thin layer of moly grease. (not 
sure if this was a good idea, but..) After assembly, I apply a few 
drops of Redline MTL (happened to have some) to each bushing/shaft.

It works like new, and so far no squeaks, after a week of driving 2-3 
hrs a day!
