Subject: Cooking in a bus, cookies that is...

I Hear that Possum fat helps make the cooking time faster and easier for all
those guys cooking in a ole Bus.  Just use it 1:1 for any called for butter,
criso, lard, or grease for the pans (baking pans only mind you). 

&gt;         ^^^^^   OK Joel, come on out, we know you're in there! Robert C 
&gt;Thomas indeed. I know Julia Childs and you suh are no Julia Childs, to 
&gt;paraphrase another.  Bet these cookies are baked with possum fat too.   Tim 
&gt;Smith
