Harvey-
Well, since i was the one that subjected my ecu to the proding and 
probing of a disrespectful ohm-meter, i'll comment  :)

i thought of this concern too and probably would not have done it if 
i had just an analog meter.  i used a Fluke 78 digital multi-meter 
and these are supposed to have an extremely high impedance when 
checking voltages and also be very 'easy' on components when checking 
resistance.  i don't have the specs for the forward voltage in 
resistance mode, however.  since the O2 sensor itself generates a 
voltage i figured i would be pretty safe testing this particular 
circuit.
