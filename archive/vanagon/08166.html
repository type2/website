Subject: Re: '74 bus, low compression

You will be surprised by the power of your engine if you can get compression
to 120 from 80. I once had compression around 80-90 for my 71 bug. After the
engine was rebuilt and get 120 compression I was so impressed by the performance
improvement. 

My 84 vanagon has compression around 130-140. My 83 Westy has around 120-130
and is already suffering from low power.
