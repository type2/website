So Joel Walker says:
&gt;   63 Microbus    2    75 Bus    6    87 Vanagon   21
&gt;   64 Microbus    7    76 Bus   17    88 Vanagon    7
&gt;   65 Microbus    5    77 Bus   16    89 Vanagon    8
&gt;   66 Microbus   16    78 Bus   23    90 Vanagon   14
&gt;   67 Microbus   19    79 Bus   15    91 Vanagon    6
&gt; 
&gt; here, the 75's low numbers are noticeable, as are the numbers for 1983.
&gt; but that doesn't explain the 88's and 89's and 91's.
&gt; 
&gt; i've tried to make some sense of it, and those model-change jitters are the
&gt; only thing i can come up with. but it doesn't explain all of the years that
&gt; are low.

The 1983 are understandable.  Thats the transition year from air to water.

I would presume the 88 - 89 drop-off is from a hefty hit from minivan competition
even though they do not have the camping/semi-camping equipment.  Some people
just have to have more power and trade off the practical/utility side. :P
(That's just my guess)

The 90 increase is because people realized what a stupid mistake it was to
purchase the powerful but useless vehicles mention in the previous paragraph
(see Shit-boxes) and so they decided to buy a real van instead.

The 91 drop off is just reflecting the production drop-off of the discontinued
Vanagon. :(
