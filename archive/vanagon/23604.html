Subject: Re: Alternator load

Not to beat a dead horse, but the excercise bike called the Lifecycle 
actually uses the principle of added electrical load=
added mechanical load to change the resistance on the pedals. The have 
the pedals connected to an alternator, and, to make the pedalling harder, 
the computer adds resistive electrcial load. The nice part is there is no 
mechanical friction or anything rubbing to wear out.
