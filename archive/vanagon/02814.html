&gt;When the VAN went for its smog test in CA (where we bought everything)
&gt;the guy said the OXS sensor was ok (mind you he had to boost rpm to
&gt;1200 to pass the idle test). Anyway who can say, sometimes though idle
&gt;is erratic and fuel consumption is not as good as it could be 21 mpg
&gt; (imp-highway).
&gt;Any info on the sensors offered by JCW or is this strictly a VW OEM thing?

don't know about the quality of JCW sensors but it is definitely NOT an
only vw oem thing. you can buy Bosch replacement sensors at many places,
especially through the mail-order places. and the one-wires are about $30
the last time i checked (of course, MINE has to be the 3-wire kind! :(  )

there is one thing to watch out for, however. when you put the new one in,
do NOT use any sort of never-seize or thread sealant or lock-tite or ANY
of that stuff ... UNLESS IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS &quot;ok for oxygen sensors&quot;. cause
if you use the wrong stuff, it will destroy the sensors usefullness very very
quickly. just passing info along. :)
