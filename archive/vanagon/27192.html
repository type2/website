I too have been through pilot bearing removal hell (but not
on a VW).  I have dealt with stuck pilot bearings on 
Toyotas and Fords, and have always used one of the following
methods:

1.  Rent or buy a puller that is made for pulling from
	the inside.  The tool you need has two little fingers
	with ridges on the end that go through the center
	of the bearing and spread open.

2.  Failing #1, I have removed two pilot bearings by
	cutting them with a hacksaw.  This is a last resort
	method!  Take a fine tooth hacksaw blade and clamp
	a vice grip on it near the middle as a handle, or use
	one of the &quot;mini&quot; sized blade holders.  Before
	sawing, destroy/remove the innards of the pilot
	bearing (the needle bearings inside) with a screwdriver
	until you are just left with the outer casing inside
	the flywheel.  *Carefully* saw through the outer
	casing using the hacksaw.  The goal is to saw 90% of
	the way through the casing from front to back, but
	not cut through completely and score the flywheel.
	Once this is done, the casing should be weak enough
	to come free with the washer method you described
	or simply by prying with a screwdriver.

I don't know how this will apply to the Volkswagen
throwout bearing (can't remember) but failing an easy
solution one of the above should work.
 
&gt; all this oil and stuff around? Also, unless we get the
&gt; bolts out on the right-side CV joint, we don't have a lot
&gt; of room to maneuver. (How do you &quot;drill&quot; bolts out?)

Did you try using the allen wrench and the vice grip on the
bolts at the same time?  The vise grip method usually
works for me.  What condition is your vice grip in?  Is
it a genuine Vice-Grip or a Taiwan special?  If the latter,
get a real one - the kind with the rounded jaws.  The straight
jawed vise-grips are not well suited to this task.  A new
pair of vice-grips has very sharp jaws that should have no
problem gripping the bolt.  Use every ounce of strength to
clamp the vise grip as tight as possible.  Use two people
if you can.  Clean the bolt head first with acetone or
some other good solvent so there will be no grease to aid
slippage.

Hope some of this helps you out...
