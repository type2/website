Subject: Serens moving to Pittsburgh



Hello Vanatics...


Yes, the decision was made, and the Seren family is moving to
Pittsburgh.  I've told my soon-to-be employer that I accepted their
offer, and told my co-workers here at bellcore that I will be leaving.

It is with deep regret that we must leave our friends here at the
Eastern end of the state.  However, we decided  that, rather than
looking back after ten years and regretting
not having given this opportunity a shot, we'd like to be able to
say that we gave it  a try. Hopefully it will turn out to be a good
decision. 

Soon (May 1st) I start my weekly haul from Bethlehem, PA to Pittsburgh
and back.  The bulk of the Seren Family will move after the end of the
school year, and once we've decided where to live, school districts
and all.  Once we're settled, of course, then we will be able to
welcome our Vanagon list friends, and we hope we will get plenty of
visits from them.

O.K., the Vanagon Content: I'll be making this 600 mile round trip
every weekend.  I plan to use the '87 for the trip.   Even though the
'87 logs about 500 miles/week currently, and has not given me any major
problems yet, it nearly has 128,000 miles on it, and my streak of good
luck may not last forever.  I need to compile a list of shops that I
can turn to in case of trouble.  I am a AAA plus subscriber, so I can
get the Vanagon towed for free up to 100 miles at a time.  Since the
one-way trip is 300 miles, I need to find 3 or 4 mechanics at
approximately equal intervals along the road.  This will enable me to
get the vanagon towed to the nearest 'trusted' mechanic for free in
case of trouble.  I'll be taking the 
I-78 West-&gt; I-81 south-&gt; Turnpike West 
route and back.  I'll appreciate any pointers I get from any of you
for good mechanics along this route.    I also need to get a list of
good reliable  VW (wasserboxer) mechanics around Pittsburgh, North
Allegheny,  Beaver county areas.


Any and all help appreciated...


Thanks, 
Cetin


BTW, some of you may know my new employer: FORE Systems.
        I checked the vanagon mailing list, and there's no one from
       FORE in this list -- I hope this is not a bad omen :-)
