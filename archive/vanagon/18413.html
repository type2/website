Subject: Lash adjusters, trichlor brake cleaner, Mill Supply

	Nice sermon on lash adjusters.
	Jon Anderson, actually, no-one is dumping billions of tons
of chloronated hydrocarbons anymore. Really. Do the non-carcinogen/non
ozone damagine varieties of brake cleaner work as a locktite primer? 
	The implication of a cleaner acting as a 'primer' is that no
priming is actually happening, but cleaning helps. That's certainly
plausible. Cos I guarantee you that brake cleaner leaves no residue!!!
(And I rather doubt the chloronated hydrocarbons interact in any way
with the loctite... its relative innertness is why its popular as 
a solvent and cleaner.)

	I'm loosing my patience with Mill Supply. I've not yet recieved
my battery shelf rust repair pannel. You'll recall that they sent me
someone else's order, sent my order to them. When I call them they
say they haven't gotten my parts back from their mis-delivery. Inasmuch
as I've just gotten and paid the charge-card bill for this transaction,
now some 5 weeks ago, I'm beginning to feel that they, not I, have
the problem.
	I'm going to call them Tuesday morning and read 'em the riot
act. If they don't ship my part sometime next week, I'm cancelling
the order. Phoey.
	I hear their stuff is good, but their customer service stinks!

	Bill
