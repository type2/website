Subject:      Re: Opinions on '97 Eurovan Sought

You caught me on a bad night..

I have a 95 Eurovan Camper and have had problems..

In 18 months and 20,000 miles I have replaced the water pump, knock (O2?)
sensor twice, not to mention numerous problems with the doors and electric
door locks

Make sure the Winnebago components work before you drive it off the lot.  I
have had LOTS of problems with the furnace and refrigerator using propane.
 After 15 months I found a dealer in the bay area that would fix them.
 Still cannot use the refrigerator in high altitude, ~5000 feet.  Dealer
told me yesterday that an update kit for the refrigerator is available for
$230.  VWA wouldn't help and referred me to Winnebago. Winnebago told me
that this kit is an &quot;option&quot; for the van, but they would make me a deal and
install it for only $88.  ( They couldn't tell me what the $88 was for..).
 Just make sure that the high altitude &quot;option&quot; is included in the deal if
you plan to ever take it to the mountains.  I guess most of us don't camp
out in the mountains, that's why it's an option..

I would purchase an extended warranty that also covers the Winnebago
components, wish I had one..

If not for the problems we've had, we really like the rig.  The &quot;lust&quot; is
now a strong &quot;fondness&quot;

Back to my letter to VWA and Winnebago,

Kevin

discussion.

&gt; For ~$33,000, I'd really like to hear from people who know, as opposed to
a
&gt; car salesman.
