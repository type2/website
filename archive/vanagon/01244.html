&gt;	Has anyone done anything like this to eliminate road and engine
&gt;noise in their van or bug?  How well does it work?  I've heard that 3M
&gt;spray adhesive is a lot better than the no name brands for this type of
&gt;application.  Any experience with these adhesives?

yup. i've done it to a 1971 bus, a 1980 vanagon, a 1988 vanagon, and a 1989
honda civic crx (my nephew's). it think it works really well ... it cuts out
a lot of the 'drumming' noises (which, quite frankly, i never noticed until
they went away).

i did, however, go a bit overboard. :)  3M makes some stuff called Rubberized
Undercoating ... it's a spray can of thick black goop (like you see under your
bus). and they also make some Silencer Strips (big thick roll of terribly
sticky stuff ... kinda like your foam with adhesive already applied on the
back).  but it is expensive! the spray stuff is about $6-8 per can (i used
... oh, i don't know ... four? cans per bus? but then, i sprayed A LOT!! the
strip stuff is even worse: $36 per roll. 50' per roll.  i used the strip
stuff to make an 'X' on the panel and then sprayed the heck out of the
uncovered parts.

i did the front doors, sliding door, rear hatch, and behind all the interior
panels i could take off. then i got really carried away with the spray stuff!
i crawled up under the bus and sprayed all the unsprayed parts i could get
to ... like above that pedal shield on the 71 bus, and above the spare tire
on the vanagon.

would i do it again? yup. soon as i got the money. i really think it is
worth it. even at the cost of the 3M stuff.

is it a pain to do? yeah, well, kinda. that spray stuff is pretty messy, so
you need to be real careful where you point that thing. and if you get the
3M stuff, be SURE to pick up some 3M General Purpose Adhesive Remover (the
little quart red can) while you are at it. you WILL need it. :)

and, while you have the panels off to put this stuff on, you might think about
stuffing some pink insulation in behind the panels. just a thought.

if you want to use the foam and spray adhesive (which admittedly would be a
lot cheaper!), 3M also makes some Spray Trim Adhesive and some Super Trim
Adhesive. i haven't been able to figure out what the difference is (i hardly
ever read the writing on the cans), but both seem to work ok. they look really
terrible, but they work. i found out that you need to spray both the metal
panel AND the stuff you want to stick to it, then wait a little while (a few
seconds) then stick them together. works better than way. (maybe i did read
that stuff on the can?).

but, yeah, anything you can stick on those big metal panels will help reduce
the overall noise level in the bus.  only one really big problem with all
that: it makes the wind noise seem louder. :)
