Subject: (fwd) rare transporter

I recently found an old, interesting vw transport.  The owner says it is a 50 
or 51, and it looks quite old.  The thing that confirms it's older, at least
older than anything I've seen, is the engine cover.  It is about twice as high
as a normal engine cover, and the whole engine compartmant is huge.  All of 
the parts are there, including all the glass and semaphores (or whatever those
turn signal things are called.  Anyways, I was wondering if anyone could give
me some more info on it.  Or, if anybody is interested in buying it, give me 
a call, or drop me a letter. Whatever.  It is way in the far north of Michigans
upper penisula.
