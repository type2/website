Subject: Milwaukee Auto Show--VWoA has no plans for Eurovan

Just a quick report on VW from the Milwaukee Auto show which just ended on
Sunday.  I asked Hans the VW rep at the auto show when we could expect to
see the 97 Eurovans and he said that VWoA has no plans to bring the Eurovan
to the US.  He said VWoA looked into it but the pricing just didn't
fit--like 30 to 35k for the CL to MV models.  He said they are able to sell
the 97 Eurobago for less than one of the Eurovan models.  He said at that
price and because of all the minivan competition they just didnt think they
would sell.  I defintely felt like this was a subject he didnt want to talk
about.  He did say that he got many inquiries from people at the show as to
Eurovan availablity.

No plans for Eurovans in the US--say it isn't so!  :(
