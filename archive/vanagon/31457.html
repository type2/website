&gt;Looking for VW cookie cutters. Real cookie cutters, not wheels. Hot VW 
&gt;published a source last year, but they're not there now. Any leads? Bug 
&gt;or Bus.

Made my VW own cookie cutter in 1972 (when I acquired a new 72 VW Bug -
remember what it was like to buy a brand new bug or bus - the new car smell -
the way it handled and sounded!)  I took an empty can - then with tin snips
shortened it to about 2&quot; tall then using plyers formed it into the shape of a
VWBug. Works good with sugar cookies - ice and decorate. The VW sugar cookies
were the hit of the office X-mas party.  I still have the cookie cutter.  I
still have the 72 Bug too!

Happy Holidays
