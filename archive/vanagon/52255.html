Subject: Re: trans input shaft dia. 85 transporter

Just had the same problem with my diesel. Took the trans out for a leaking
input shaft seal, ended up doing a pilot shaft and clutch. The shaft was
rather reasonable though, about $75.00. I didn't think that was too bad.
It's easy to replace although I did have to borrow a tool from the dealer to
remove the final drive bearing holders. (One of the benifits of working for
them for 12 years) No problem, just mark the housings before you take it
apart. Replace the side seals while you have it apart though. To answer your
question how much play is allowed. my bearing was completely gone and the
shaft badly scored and I had no shifting problems at all. But the center of
the clutch dick, which is spring loaded was very loose. I suspect that
someday it would have left me stranded with a clutch in a bunch of pieces.

&gt;I had a clutch put in my 85 transporter at the dealer (world's WORST VW
&gt;dealership (name whithheld)) and I guess they didn't put a new pilot
&gt;bearing (supporting the input shaft for the trans.) in when they did so.
&gt;Anyway it disintegrated after a while and my shaft got kind of chewn a bit.
&gt;Anybody know how much play it can have in the bearing? I doubt any, but
&gt;what kind of work (and cost) is it to replace the shaft?
&gt;
&gt;Also, downshifting into 2nd, grinds a bit.  Other gears are fine except on
&gt;long trips, ie when everything is hot - things get a bit stiff. Any ideas?
