Subject:      Wetwesties camping, this weekend.

Just in case anyone from the NW is missing the stuff going on in the
Wetwesties list:
After a succesful eastern OR inaugural trip, we are having our second
camping event in Drain,OR. this coming weekend. A considerable number of
people from WA, OR and ID are expected to attend. The site is at the
Crandall's property, who own some relly neat splitties. Everyone is
welcomed (as long as you drive a VW...) The Wetwesties is happening!
For more info, check out the Wetwesties list in Ron's http://Vanagon_dot_com
page.
Cheers,
Cris.
