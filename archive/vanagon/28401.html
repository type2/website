Anyone have any idea what 15&quot; beauty rings for old bus
wheels are going for?  Last I heard a set of 4 NOS 14&quot; rings
were $75-100 and I assume the 15&quot; version pulls in a higher
price.


  Have you found any NOS 15&quot; rings?    Tell me if you find some, new or used.
  I want two more for the 61.
