Subject: Clutch Cable

Well, it finally happened. Pulling out of the parking
garage yesterday, going from first to second, the clutch
cable broke. Well, it did not break completely, it just
frayed out until the few remaining strands just stretched 
instead of breaking. 

Where can I get a new clutch cable for a '71 Bus? Will the
UFLVWD (Unfriendly local VW dealer) have one? Will I have
any luck at the FLAPS? Should I call up Recycled Bugs?
Who else?

What will it cost me?

Are there any tricks or tips for a quick and painless installation
and anything I should do to make sure the next one lasts 23 years?
