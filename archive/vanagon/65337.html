Subject:      Posting big things to the list

VW Folks,

I'm really smart about a lot of things. Cooking. Bosch engine management.
Corporate Communications Strategies for Fortune 500 companies.

I am a complete dolt about the Internet.

Now a lot of folks have been asking for the BIG posting I promised about
soundproofing/insulation/rustproofing VW's and I am working diligently on it.
It is now 5 pages in Word, and will probably come to an even dozen.

I know there's got to be a better way to stick this fascinating tome out
there than e-mailing 12 pages of text to everyone on the list. Can some
kindhearted listee write or call and hold my hand through whatever I need to
do? (I washed this morning, I swear).

Thanks, as always,

gmbulley
fairfax, va
