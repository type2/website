Subject: Re: EEEEK!  Oil light flickering


&gt; Got off of the freeway, was driving about 65 for around 15 miles.  
&gt; Stopped for red light at end of off ramp (Jimmy Carter Blvd. for you 
&gt; grits fans) and as the engine starts to idle, the oil LED begins to 
&gt; flicker.

I had a similar problem with an oil light that would flicker and some-
times stay on while the oil level was OK.  Turned out the that wire 
leading down to the oil pressure switch was pinched and was shorting
to ground.  (The oil pressure light switch normally grounds the 
connection to turn on the light)

Check the wire.  It comes out of the wire harnesses on the left side 
of the engine compartment near the control boxes.  On my 85 Vanagon it
is a single, black wire that goes into an in-line spade lug disconnect.
&gt;From the disconnect, it continues as a brown wire to the FRONT of the 
left head where it goes down around and under the head.

The oil pressure switch is located on the bottom of the left head 
between the cylinders.  You can't see it because of the sheet metal, 
gravel guard that covers this area to protect the push rod tubes.  But
you should be able to follow the wire enough to be sure it is not 
pinched by the cover, or pulled too tight around a turn.
