I have a Yakima roof rack on my non-westy Vanagon.  I have never had any =
problems with it and would recommend one to anyone.  The only negative =
aspects I have noticed is first, the bike are WAY up there, I use the =
&quot;LockJaw&quot; upright bike mounts.  It's a little tricky to get the bikes up =
there at first, but once you get the hang of it (and a step ladder) it's =
easy.  Also the rack cost quite a bit, $500-600 complete (Hi rise =
towers, 66&quot; bars, 6 lock cores, 3 lockjaw mounts)
