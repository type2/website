&gt; This business of the posting sweepstakes is really too much. We gotta think
&gt; about this one real hard before letting it go any further. Gerry had earlier
&gt; said he wasn't going to publish the sweepstakes winners to avoid encouraging
&gt; people to post needlessly. 

I don't think any of us really took that seriously.  Do you really think that
some of us are going to post more just to be higher on that list?  Naaaah...

&gt; What are the &quot;goods?&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; The goods are information and analysis that people can use to survive in this
&gt; world with the curse of VW Van ownership and/or obsession. Put another way, I
&gt; think we can all agree that Joel delivers the goods when he posts internal VW
&gt; technical documents, types in a Trailer Life article, or much of the rest of
&gt; the time. 

Yes, I think everyone agrees that Joel is a demi-God, but there are other &quot;goods&quot;
as well.  There is a stronger bond between members of this list than I have seen
on any other mailing list.  To me, it has been more than a source of information,
it has also been a source of new friends.  I don't know if that would have been
the case if our fearless list maintainer had been as &quot;strict&quot; with postings as
other list administrators... in fact, I know it wouldn't.  Maybe this was not
the original intent of the list, but...

&gt; If message quality were uniform, then too many postings would not be a
&gt; problem. The problem is that a select few dilute the quality of this list by
&gt; posting with abandon. 

Hey buddy, that's *reckless* abandon.

&gt; I think the list had a higher average quality level last summer and spring
&gt; before some of the frequent posters started going wild. For you new people on
&gt; the list, you really owe it to yourself to get the postings from back then,
&gt; especially Joel's.

Hmmm... that's about the time I joined.

&gt; The idea of the /f indicator in the subject heading was a great idea somebody
&gt; came up with and I see that some are now using this. I love this idea as it
&gt; saves me a lot of time. For those who didn;t catch it, an /f symbol at the
&gt; end of the subject message in a post indicates that it is a messages posted
&gt; &quot;just for fun.&quot; I feel that anyone who uses this symbol should be allowed to
&gt; post any message no matter how silly, brief, inspired, or whatever. 

I wouldn't go that far.  There should still be some restraint, as the list can
only take so much traffic before it grinds to a halt, /f or no /f.  Still, I
like the /f idea.  Hey, wait a minute, I was the one that suggested it!  Oh yeah,
that was back when I was on those painkillers for my wisdom teeth... no wonder
I don't remember.  Here's a flashback:

&gt; &gt;        I just had a thought:  Since there has been some discussion of
&gt; &gt; the types of things that are posted to this list, maybe we could insert
&gt; &gt; a small token into the header for posts that are non-VW related so those
&gt; &gt; people that are getting overwhelmed by mail could sort through it a little
&gt; &gt; easier.  I was thinking we could put [f] at the end of the topic to
&gt; &gt; identify the post as for &quot;fun&quot;.  What do you all think?  I for one read
&gt; &gt; all posts to this list - I wouldn't miss them!  I just thought that this
&gt; &gt; might be something that would make a few more people happy.  Or maybe it's
&gt; &gt; just these painkillers going to my head...


&gt; I wonder if someone could sign up for the list and become so terrorized
&gt; reading about hundreds of possible repairs and modifications that they would
&gt; immediately decide to sell their van?

Well, if that happens, it was for a good reason.  For some, owning a VW is just
plain too much work, and some people don't have time for it, or the desire to
deal with it.  For them, it's best if they find out quickly, so even in that
case I think we are helping.
