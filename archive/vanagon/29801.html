Subject: Re: Engine transplant ideas??

I don't have much to contribute to this discussion besides my raving
advocacy of Porsche sixes, but I do want to mention that I'm running my
engine 2.5 inches lower (measured at the crank pulley) than stock with no
problems in a year.  So there is apparently this much play in acceptable 
engine height.  I haven't worked out whether I am making life easier or
harder for my CVs, but they haven't complained.  I know that the ground
clearance I gave up quite willingly is precious to the Syncronauts on the
list, but hanging the engine lower may be a solution for the Westy people
who don't want to invite the induction system into their beds.
