&gt;      Well I attempted to put to use all the good advice I got on how to

&gt;      '85 Vanagon.  However, I naively assumed it would be easy to get the 
&gt;      wheels off--I could not remove even one of the lug nuts.   I have 
&gt;      tried penetrating oil soaked over night, heat from a propane torch, &amp; 
&gt;      a six point impact socket and 2 foot breaker bar.

Just to make sure; you are turning counter-clockwise, right?  

OK, get a longer pipe.  I use one that slips over my lug wrench, about 6
feet long.  I really don't put them on that tight, it's just that they tend
to set up over time and the 6-footer makes it nice and easy to remove the
lugs.
