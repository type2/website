&gt; It caught my eye, but the wife says &quot;I don't wanna pickup; I wanna
&gt; splittie.&quot;  I'm still thinking tho.  If it's in decent shape, is this
&gt; a deal not to be passed up?  I suspect they're fairly rare, but how
&gt; much so?

I would buy it if it wasn't a rust bucket.  I have been looking for one 
myself.  Actually, if you grab this I will give you my '66 MicroBus for it!
