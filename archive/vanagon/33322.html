Dave have you seen the film &quot;1969?&quot;  well it also suffered from poor script,
questionable actors and well... it was just a b movie, but a high point to
the movie was the vehicles that were used and a little tid-bit that i relate
to the movie.  There was a split in the movie, throughout most of the movie.
it was Kieffer Sutherland's microbus.  also there was a fine corvair
specimen.  well the scene i am referring to was when Kieffer and his
girlfriend were speeding by an army convoy, (somewhere in Cal. I beleive)
and the girl opens the window as they were passing the convoy and flashes
them the peace sign.  the responses from the soldiers ranged from the middle
finger and a shout of _at_#$% you, you #$%^7 hippies to some of the soldiers
flashing the peace sign back at them.  about 4-5 yrs ago my wife and I were
drivign our loaf through ohio I believe and yes of course we passed a army
convoy and thescene was recreated in real life only about  30 yrs later.
just thought I'd share.
