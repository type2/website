&gt; This reminded me of another stupid trick I tried once - when I first got my
&gt; bus, the fuel filter kept clogging with huge flakes of rust colored crud.  On
&gt; a long, twisty mountain road home, the first filter bit the rust, requiring
&gt; me to coast into the first safe pull-off I could find (happily, a friendly
&gt; rural driveway).  And lucky me, I just happened to have a spare filter, so
&gt; set about replacing the bad boy.  Pulled what I thought to be the &quot;dry&quot; side
&gt; of the fuel line off first - *wrong*!!!  Gas shot out all over the place, so
&gt; I quickly capped it with my thumb while groping/kicking for the tool box and
&gt; grabbed the first small cylindrical object I found, rammed it down the gas
&gt; line -  wiped my brow, THEN realized - it was a plastic pen and was melting
&gt; before my eyes!!  After carving nearly 4 inches of hose away, (and with
&gt; *wooden* pencil in hand!) I finally got past the gluey, sloppy mess that used
&gt; to be a writing instrument to fresh flowing gazzohleen.  Nothing but pencils
&gt; in my toolbox now!

About fuel line nightmares.  Maybe others have tried this(?):
In my last post about Thom's sadly departed Kombi, I forgot to relay a
workaround to having to crawl under the bus to disconnect the fuel line
that I use on my splits.  Not *exactly* pristine stock for show, mind you,
but practical for the daily driving/frequent maintenance I seemed to be
doing at the time.  I took the metal section of fuel tubing out of the loop
altogether, ran a single long piece of braided VW fuel line from the tank,
NOT through the tin but around it (there was enough room to do this without
pinching the line, but you have to watch for wear where it goes between tin
and body, and you want to make sure it doesn't come too close to the heater
box, which hardens the rubber).  That way, when I wanted to pull the engine
(or whatever), I just disconnected the line at the fuel pump and stuck the
pencil in it.  Easy way to keep the gas from spraying was to quickly lift
it up above the level of the tank, at which point the flow stops due to
gravity.  I used to just put the line around that vertical metal brace on
the left side of the compartment to get it out of the way till I was done
with the job.  Never got gas running down my arm again while I fumbled to
get the pencil in after that.

Other thing.  I used to use those cheap plastic fuel filters, one before
the fuel pump (cause I used to get rust flakes clogging the pump element)
and one before the carb.  But I *still* wound up with dirt clogging the
idle jets in the carb every few months.  Got fed up and put in one of those
glass filters with the cleanable element in the line and never got dirt in
the carb again.
