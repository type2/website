&gt; Guess what happened?? I pop the back hatch. The fan looked a little
&gt; cockeyed in the housing (73 type 4 engine). I go to push it on, and the
&gt; (*&amp;(*&amp; thing comes off in my hands!!!! The bracket it bolts to wasn't
&gt; bolted to the crankshaft and trashed the front seal. All in all, the probs
&gt; bark was worse then it's bite. Apparently the fit of the bracket on the
&gt; crank was so tight the previous owner (po) didn't realize that it needed
&gt; one!! And silly Jamie didn't go looking for missing bolts!! Aghhhh..
&gt; 
&gt; I need a drink.

Can you say &quot;Gotcha!&quot;  Oh well, at least you can look your gf in the
eye and honestly say that it wasnt your fault (?) ;)

Glad to hear she's okay (your gf I mean).  Oh and the '73 too. ;)

I think I'd do a good look-over of the engine and the attached paraphenalia
to make sure there are no other &quot;gotcha's&quot; in there.  You got one hell of
fair warning this time. :( 

Enjoy,
