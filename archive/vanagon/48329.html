&gt;There's also a pretty good blues festival that happens just blocks &gt;away over Labor Day weekend. Music outdoors is hard to beat...

Careful, now. Busses By The Arch is actually held about thirty-five
miles northwest of the Arch, at Cherokee Lakes Campground, in O'Fallon
MO!

Don't plan on driving to the St. Louis Gateway Arch and looking for
other busses. You may find other busses that don't have the directions,
either, and you will all miss the main event, though sounds like you'll
have a nice one of your own :-)!

If you want more specific directions:
