There are two ways to respond to your offer: a) we all had to start
somewhere and for most of us it was trial and error (more error than
anything). One could argue that the moral thing to do would be pass on
that knowledge through your method lest past mistakes be repeated. The
learning curve would
be much less steep for those who benefit from this wisdom. b) the second
response is that such a system already exists in albeit a less than ordered
fashion  -its called Vanagon listerv- and the associated FAQs.
Unfortunately there are too many inhibited lurkers out there who would benefit
immeasureably from speaking up but don't. No question is too simple or
foolish if it is asked with honest intent. So ask! There are some  real
wise people on this list.  --
