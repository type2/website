Subject: Re: The Bus Stop

Funny, Sideshow bob - I had a similar mishap with the Bus Stop people but
it was in regards to a ragtop for my '65 deluxe.  Headliner was a little
short on material to complete the job but had the cut out for the sunroof.
Anyways I wrote them, told them about the internet, maybe suggested it would
not be in thier best interest to have a bad rep circulating on the internet
etc. etc.... Anyway, got a response back from the president with an adequate
appology...  Gave them a second chance for lack of another EASIER source
