Subject: Engine Surging

&gt;My wasserboxer motor is surging at idle.  I think I remember reading about
&gt;this problem on the list before so I will try the archives.  Meanwhile if
&gt;any of you have a clue as to what is happening the help would be welcome.
&gt;The symtoms are constant surging between 900 and 1200 rpm after hot and at
&gt;at idle.  When driving all seems fine.  I have run some fuel injector
&gt;cleaner through a tank of gas and that had no effect.  Could there be
&gt;an air leak somewhere ?  Hoping for a simple solution  (:-)
&gt;

I had a similiar problem just after a bought my 87' Syncro.  You propably
need to adjust the throttle switch.  It is located just below the throttle
housing.  It can be adjusted by turning the two allen head screws adjacent to
the throtle body.  The Bently Manual goes into this in better detail.  This
cured my problem approximatly 20K miles ago.  No problems since.
