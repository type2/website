Subject: '74 rough running

Ok,

I think I tried everything.  My '74 Bus is running rough and I cna't think
of why.  I replace the entire ignition system (coil, plugs, wires,
distributor, etc) and had the carbs rebuilt.  Many peolpe here on the list
have given me ideas about what the trouble may be, but none of it seemed
to be correct.  I give up.  On monday I want to take it into a repair
shop.  Does anyone in Seattle have any recommendations of where to go and
not get ripped off?  I'm thinking about goind to Import Service Center on
Aurora.  Is this place ok?

Or, if anyone can think of any other causes of my problems please feel
free to let me know.

Symptoms:Very rough running at low rpm and part throttle conditions (45
mph in fourth gear).  High idle that can't be brought lower than aobut
1000 rpm.  Lack of power.  When I floor it, the engine runs smooth but
lacks power-it only bucks and runs rough at part throttle.

Any advice is appreciated.  One thing I have gotten out of this is a ton
of experience at working on this motor, so I guess that's a good thing.

Craig
