So Steve Hoge says:

&gt; &gt; he could hear voices, seemingly a chorus. There was John Lennon, 
&gt; &gt; Jim Croche, Janice Joplin, James Brown, Elvis, Ricky Nelson 
&gt; &gt; and Jackie Wilson.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Uh, I hate to be a nitpick, but please, James Brown's not dead yet! (I'm
&gt; not sure about Ricky Nelson...)
&gt; 

Umm...I DO mean to nitpick, but did you have to include the ENTIRE previous
post??????   

C'mon folks,  PLEASE TRIM YOUR POSTS!!!!!

Whew!  

Asbestos suit and underwear with flame retardant on.....
