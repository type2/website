Subject: Re: bodega packing list

Martha sez:

&gt;If anyone has any additions to this, I'd appreciate hearing from you...
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;Things to bring, in order of priority:

(all sorts of useless gunk expurgated)

&gt;beer, wine, or other &quot;substance&quot; of your choice

Martha:

You must have been trying to play some sort of cruel yet subtle joke here.
For the sake of those on their way to Bodega, I must point out that you put
the items of highest priority last on the list.

I just hope it's not too late for people to re-pack!!
