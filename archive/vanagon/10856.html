For my 65 Beetle, I used a quick drying contact cement.  You brush it on both
pieces, let it dry, and then put them together.  You kinda have to do it right
the first time.  The stuff I used really sticks.  Also,  take time to get
everything fitted right before you stick it together.  It'll look much nicer
when you're done.
