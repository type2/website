Hi all, 

Here is a further update on my gastank quest.  Since mine is rus and junk
free on the inside i am going to have it welded.  I have found a place
here in Stl. that will weld and pressure test it for $69.95. 2 hour
service!

The pressure test gives me some security that it will be done right, and
after reading the post on all teh small passageways i have become much
less comfortable with the idea of throwing a bunch of goop in there...

Since the sloshing stuff costs $20-30 and good fiberglass would be around
$10-20 for the supplies, im already in $40.00 anyway with no gurantee that
it would work at all. $69.95 stars to look like a bargain.

more to come...

Steve
