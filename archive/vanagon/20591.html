Subject: sponge..

It seems that I spend alot of time under my bus - even when its running
great.  Well, last Sat. I was under there checkin' out the front tranny
mount (as suggested by a few of you) to make sure its all tight etc...
I noticed my shift coupler was in bad shape.  Maybe thats why it likes
to slip out of fourth (slim chance anyways..).  Anyways, coming back from
visiting I noticed the shifting getting very spongy.  Now I can only
get it in to 2nd about half the time.  Oh well, 1st to 3rd.  Fourth is even
had to engage.  Shifter is floating even more so.  Stop to pick up my briefcase.Now I can't get it into reverse.  Shift to first.  Oops now its in third. Wow.
now its really foating (I not moving, just have the clutch in.) Oh Oh. complete
shifter freedom.  Not even the sponge action.  I have to cruise home now all 
the way in 3rd.    This morning I ordered the coupler from RMMW overnight UPS.
Since I'm ringing up the Ol' VISA may as well get some other goodies to make
the shipping worth it.  Same old moral:   Fix it before it completely breaks.
