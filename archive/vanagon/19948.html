Subject: Exhaust Stud Nuts
Date: Thu, 29 Jun 1995 10:56:00 -0500 (CDT)

I have read in various places that bronze, brass or copper alloy nuts 
with copper based anti-seize are the desired thing to have on the 
exhaust studs.  Now, can someone say for sure which alloy I want?  
Also, where can I mail order about eight of them?  I am stuck in a VW 
wasteland.  They look at me funny at the parts counters when I ask for
parts.  I have heard that Porsche has nuts that work for this.  Any 
other suggestions?  Thanks, Jim
