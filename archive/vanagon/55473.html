Subject: Group camping anyone?

Hey all,
My spring break this semester runs from Friday March 7th to Sunday March
16th.  

What I want to know is if anyone's up for some camping that week,
preferably an organized group thing :) .  

I know many of you are past the &quot;spring break&quot; point in your lives but
maybe you can set aside a weekend?  Or how about all that &quot;use or lose&quot;
sick leave? ;)

I have no idea where would be best to camp.  I'm sure many of you have
suggestions (BTW, this is an East Coast thing, I'm in Fredericksburg,
VA, so I'm talking to D.C. area listers here) as far as good parks, etc.
I may take a vote on that closer to the time of the break.  

If anyone thinks that they can or would like to do this that second week
of March, please e-mail me so I can get a rough count.

Thanks,
Sean
