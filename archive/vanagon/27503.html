weiss Import Auto Parts in nearby Redwood City,
California: a well known local VW parts place.  I spoke to Mark who tells
me that they stock replacement rear hatch struts for Vanagons.

For hatches with window wiper motors mounted:  $42.50
For hatches without wiper motors:              $48.15  (that's right - more!)

Plus your state tax or 8.25% in Calif.

They ship worldwide: UPS about $6.00.
