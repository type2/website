Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I use about an 8200 BTU propane heater by Olympian. I hang it on my 
&gt; refrigertaor door (1985 westy). Works VERY well in snows at Tahoe. Has 
&gt; thermostatic control so it goes on and off automatically.
&gt; 

How much propane does this guy use?  Can I get away with using one of the
&quot;little&quot; bottles (32oz?) that are used for camp stoves, if I'm only using
it an hour a day for maybe 2 or 3 days?

How about ventilation?  I assume this little guy puts out CO, which tends
to sink.  Since my Vanagon is a Weekender, my bed is kind of low, and I'd
like to wake up in the morning!

I've also thought about the &quot;flameless&quot; catalytic heaters.  Is the Olympian
one of those?

Thanks,

-Jim
