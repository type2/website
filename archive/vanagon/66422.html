Subject:      How to test camping equipment

I'm considering purchasing a 87 Vanagon camper. When I go to the used
car lot the dealer doesn't seem to knowledgeable about the camping
equipment. How do I test the fridge, sink and stove to make sure they're
working? Does the fridge run on propane only or also on battery?

Thanks,
Eric
