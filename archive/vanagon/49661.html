Subject: 

I need some help finding some exhaust parts for a 1982 Westy, aircooled. It
seems to be damn near impossible to find the rear collector pipe. I've
checked all over from , FLAPS to scrap yards all to no avail. Any help or
pointers would be just wonderful. Ive got a couple of calls in to some list
vendors &quot;ie- BusBoys,, and VolksmotorSport&quot;, but all to no avail. Help!!!
