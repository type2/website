Subject: Re: EV extended warranty....

Hi Robert,

I transferred the extended warranty from the previous owner when I bought my
EV about a year ago. I've only had to use it once, but when I did there were
no problems. So far so good. The warranty is from General Electric Warranty
Services or something like that. It's GE anyway.

 I got a pretty good deal on &quot;buying&quot; the warranty along with the van. As I
recall, the original price of the 7 year, 100k mile, bumper to bumper, $100
deductible warranty was about $1200 when the EV was new. I got it when the
vehicle was 2 years old and had 21k miles on it. I paid $500 for the
warranty. Transfer of the warranty to my name wasn't too much trouble. I've
gotten $100 of value out of it so far. I figure one problem with the AC or
electrical system and I'll be ahead of the game.
