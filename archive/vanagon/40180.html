Subject: URL for camping fabrics, etc.


One of my favorite old-time (but not terribly well-known) companies
has apparently just joined the cyber-revolution.  Or perhaps I've
just now heard about it.  :)  At any rate, I thought many of you
might like to, also.  They are Frostline Kits, and offer all sorts
of outdoor/camping clothing and equipment which you can either order
in kit form from them to make yourself, or have the option of paying
more for, and order it already sewn/made up.  They have things
like parkas, comforters, sleeping bags, carrying/holding items,
gloves, slippers, vests, etc.  

Perhaps at least as interesting as all this is that they carry
some very unusual fabrics by the yard at what I thought were
fairly reasonable prices, for retail at least.  This includes
things like gortex-type fabrics, fleeces, canvases, nylons, mesh,
etc.  Also, they have a large selection of insulation, hardware,
accessories, zippers, threads, cuffs, etc., which may be of
special interest to diehard camping enthusiasts.  You can even
order fabric swatches.

p.s. - for those of you needing clear plastic (to cover headlights
or to make windows for your type 181 thing convertibles), they
carry what looks to be a sturdy version of this as well.
