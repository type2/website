Subject: Emessions still

Got the co2 to pass, new O2 sensor and new seals for the injectors.  thanks 
for all the input.  However still failing hydro carbons at idle.  So finally 
took the $yncro to the dealer(Dick Hanna Vancouver Wa).  They think it is the 
catalytic converter and will cost $1000 if they do it, or they will take it 
Menicke who will do it for $190.  Why the difference and does this sound like 
the right fix?
