&gt;I recently went to a VW junkyard looking for parts and found a bus that 
&gt;had the inner panels removed and appeared to have house insulation 
&gt;between the outer wall and the inner panelling. Anybody ever heard 
&gt;of/tried this? Being in Seattle, I'm looking for any way to stay warmer 
&gt;this winter.

I glued 3/4&quot; carpet padding to the metal on the walls on my bus, and then put 
the panels back over it.  It not only made it warmer, but quieter!

Another trick, for those with Kombis and panels, is to make a divider
to go betwixt the front seats and the back of the bus.  That way, the 
meager amount of hear that makes it up to the front doesnt make an
immediate runn for the back hatch.  This may not be the desired situation if
you have anyone riding back there, so make it removable!
