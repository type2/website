I go to Bob's VW in West Springfield Mass. for my Vanagon GL Syncro...They do
excellant work and are very honest bout your parts.  When you get somethin
fixed they give you if you want it the old parts.  I've also heard crowly
automotive in Hartford is good.  No I wouldnt go to peoples because they are
way too expensive for me.  There prices are triple the prices of Bob's.....
