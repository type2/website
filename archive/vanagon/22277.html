&gt;Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 86 Vanagon and the front speakers are blown. The trick is the
&gt;speaker plate has to be flush on the interior door so the window crank can
&gt;work (all other speakers I can find have a raised speaker plate about 1/4
&gt;to 1/2 inches). Any thoughts on replacements?
&gt;


The simplest solution - take each handle off and bend it (actually the
internal alloy part slightly!      The plastic cover snaps back on and
looks fine (my opinion).   Cheap fix, too.  I've done this with two vans
and 4 handles so far, with good results.


Dave
