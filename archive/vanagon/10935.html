Subject: Re: :) Water 'n' Diesels - Compability problems?  

 The 
&gt;guy at the garage looked at the service truck and said - I 
&gt;wouldn't drive a diesel through there.

Well I wouldn't either.  All you need to do is splash some of that water
into your air intake, have some of that cold water get sucked into your
combustion chambers that are heated to about a million degrees F and &quot;poof&quot;
there goes your engine!  Drive slow, very slow through water with any diesel
automobile.
