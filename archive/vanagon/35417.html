So Scott Sminkey - Sustaining Eng Group says:
&gt; I picked up my '91 Vanagon after having it's 60,000 mile service and
&gt; a few other things. I had a good chat with the &quot;service advisor&quot;. When
&gt; I asked him how he knew the head gasket was leaking, he said that there
&gt; was coolant leaking out/dripping from around the head. So, it turns out
&gt; that is *not* oil and coolant mixing, so now it really sounds like the
&gt; classic head gasket leak problem. (The service advisor admitted that he
&gt; wasn't too clear on the phone when he explained the whole thing.)

This is actually the good news.  From your previous posts, I was really
suprised to read that oil was mixing with coolant.  Glad it was on the
outside of the engine!  ;)

&gt; I asked him what could cause this to happen at such low mileage. He
&gt; looked pretty embarrassed and said that if he was an engineer he could
&gt; probably explain it, but he kinda sorta hinted that it should not have
&gt; happened particularly given the extra care I have taken on the cooling
&gt; system. He recommended contacting VWoA and pleading my case. He said he
&gt; wouldn't be surprised if they paid for something like half of the repair.

I think you should try taking this to arbitration as the vehicle still
has relatively low miles on it.  Some friends of ours did just that and
ended up returning the van and getting a full refund.  I don't think
you could get a full refund, but as the mechanic said, you'll probably
get a partial refund on the engine work.  That seems to be the best
route to take right now for these kinds of (basket) cases.  It takes
time, but it does get resolved eventually.  Be sure to record all of
your transactions and keep your receipts!  

You can find further info. on arbitration in the archives.

Good Luck!
