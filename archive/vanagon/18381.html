&gt;           Can anyone send me some directions to the Manassas Bugout

&gt;           McLean, VA, and can make it to 95 south...I just don't know
&gt;           where in Manassas the place is...and how much will
&gt;           admission/parking be?

&gt;           Thanks a million!

&gt;From McLean I'd go out 66 instead of down to 95.


I'll make these a little more general for anyone else listening.  I was 
hoping someone with mileages could respond also.

Coming from the West on 66 East take the Route 234 Manassas exit.  Follow 
234 through its bends - you'll know when you get there.

&gt;From the South on 95 North take the 234 Dumfries exit.  Again follow 234 
until you get there.

&gt;From DC/MD/Northern Virginia you have the option of 66 West or 95 South.  
Kind of depends onhow close to which you are.  If you take 95 south you 
can take the 234 Dumries Exit West.  From 66 You can take the 234 exit or 
jump of early on 28 south.  If you take 28 followit until you get to 234 
East.  Follow it a couple of miles until you get there.  

I'd post some nifty short cuts if I had a map here at work.  I might 
repost them later tonight with approximate mileages if I get time.

The key road to find is Route 234.  It has an exit on both I 95 and I 66.

&gt;From I 95 you want to go North-East. From I 66 you want you want to go 
South West.

Hope nobody gets lost lstening to me - you shouldn't.
