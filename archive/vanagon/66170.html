&gt; Hi,
&gt; I would likr to thank JOEL, IAN, GREG, and JUSTIN for their help regarding
&gt; my bearing noise.
&gt; (A hum that disappeared when I turned to the right).  By spinning the wheels
&gt; with the car on the lift
&gt; my trusty mechanic, Louis, found the culprit - the outer right front
&gt; bearing.  Total cost 45$ (Cdn about 32$ US)) including the bearing.
&gt; Thanks again for the help and support.

Hi: Your lucky. Last year while on the road I had to have My Syncro
front wheel bearings changed bay a dealer. It cost over 600$ Cdn. Kinda
Wrecked the vacation. Oh well, still love the Syncros.
