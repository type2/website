&gt;Whenever I have an interior panel off for any reason, I spray heavily with
&gt;undercoating on the back surface of the exterior sheet metal.  This has
&gt;failed to make my front doors sound like Mercedes doors.  On the plus side,
&gt;it means that there is no excuse for spending $16/sq.ft. for the stick-on
&gt;noise damping material, since it wouldn't stick on now.  Think of the money
&gt;I've saved.
&gt;
&gt;What are others doing?

When I've removed interior panels, I've stuck on some imitation &quot;Dynamat&quot;
(sp?  I think thius is the name of the genuine stuff)  stuff and also filled
the cavity with attic style fiberglass insulation.  I first started using the
insulation when I found out that my noticeably quieter 88 Wolfsburg had
similar insulation installed at the factory.  The insulation and stuff has
made a difference, but as Mr. Kennedy points out, it hasn't turned my Vanagon
into a Mercedes either.
