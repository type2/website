Subject: Re: Add-on Oil Coolers

Thread has morphed into a gauge thread and my 2 cents is that cheaper
gauges (than the $50 estimated in a previous post) are ok.  If you need
to choose between one VDO gauge and two or three JC Whitney's, get the
cheap ones.  You don't need accuracy to the nearest 2lbs of oil pressure,
you just need to be able to tell when the engine starts doing something
it didn't do yesterday.

I'd hate to think that anyone is scared off from gauging their van in
a healthy way by the cost of fancy VDO parts.  Gauges let you drive 
with much more confidence.
