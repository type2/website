Yo Bricks!....don't include the headers when you reply to list messages. 
The list has to be pretty conservative to keep all the bad messages  
from being distributed. 

Thanks!

----- Begin Included Message -----
&gt; I've got a choking problem since I bought my 84 vanagon new 10 years ago.

Gee,

  I have had one since I got that $700 fuel tank estimate...Wanna switch
problems?

Matthew, why don't you just get the whole thing, my choking 84 vanagan, for
$7000.0000? It will save you $700.0000 for swapping the gas tank.

Oh, by the way, my vanagon not only chokes but also, coughs, hickups and
from time to time got some fever. How do you think? Na, better forget about
it. Take my advice, your $700 thing could be needed by you someday. Who knows?
