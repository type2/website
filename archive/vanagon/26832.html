Whooaaah Nellie!  I went to my FLAPS last night to price a
new O2 sensor for my 89 vanagon and they quoted me $120!!!!!!
Does that sound right to y'all?  I just put on in a friend's
car for 25 bucks!  Granted the one I priced last night was a
Bosch and his was some no-name-whatever.

I haven't had the courage to look anywhere else yet.  Any suggestions?
Should I be scared to call around?
