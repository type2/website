Does anyone have a source of replacement locks for a '84 vanagon?
Reguardless of how much Kroil I put in mine, I still only have one that
works.  The hatch of course.  Luckily I have 4 kids that thing its great
fun to be the &quot;monkey&quot; that gets to go through the back to unlock the
other doors.  My wife is threatening not to drive it until I get the
worn ignition lock fixed!!

Thanks
Mark
