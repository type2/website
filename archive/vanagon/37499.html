Subject: parking brake puzzle

3 times over the last 2 years I have had a weird problem with the parking
brake.

when I park overnight with the brake on in the morning the brake will not
release. I have to go backwards &amp; forwards sveral times before the parking
brake releases.
I have not disassembled the rear brakes and when it is released it stays that
way for months.
there seems to be a correlation with the occurence and the dew at night but I
can't fix it for sure.

Should I just forget it, or am I going to try to move one morning and be
permantly stuck.
