Hey all,
	I have to say thanks to everyone who has sent me helpful info on
	buses, it's gonna come in handy one day :) .  Looks like a lot
	of good information.  Many have recommended the Muir Bible,
	of which I used to have a copy, but I left it (on purpose -- a
	goodwill thing) in the trunk of my bug when I sold it.  So, I
	will definitely get another one because that was just a great
	book to read.  Also, where can i get a Bentley manual?  Do I
	have to order it from VW or can I get it at a bookstore?  I have
	my Beetle/Super Beetle/Karmann Ghia Bentley manual but I forgot
	how I got it.  Another question (to tax the collective knowledge
	of the list):  I have heard that you can buy a blower motor that
	installs under the dash inline with the ducts for the defroster
	vents (for breadloaf buses) to speed defrosting in the winter.
	Where does one get this?  J.C. Whitney?  VW?  I would want a
	high quality one, not a cheap loud monster that puts a huge
	strain on the electrical system.  My bug had a cheap one under
	the back seat and when you turned that thing on, the alternator
	light started glowing (medium strength), especially if the
	lights and radio were on.  That can't be much of a good thing --
	I eventually took it out because it worked better without it
	anyway.  I want to avoid that kind of thing with a bus and go
	right for a good one.  Any recommendations?  Thanks again
	everybody for your help -- I'm intimately familiar with bugs and
	therefore somewhat knowledgable about all air-cooled VWs but I
	want to learn the peculiarities of the bus so I know what to
	look for (or look out for).  By being on this list, I hope to
	amass a huge amount of bus info before I buy so I will be
	prepared :) .  Thanks for putting up with my long posts -- I'll
	try to keep them shorter in the future.

	Sean
