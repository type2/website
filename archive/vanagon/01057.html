Subject: Change Springs w/o pulling head!

Guys, I read this on rec.autos.antique. I thought it was pretty
nifty for changing the valve springs, etc. with the heads still
on the car. No engine pull!

&gt;If you can turn the engine over by hand (via the fan or belt/pulley,
&gt;both forward and backward), you don't need a compressor.  Just feed
&gt;several feet of clean rope into the cylinder via the spark plug hole
&gt;and hand turn the engine over so the piston crushes the rope up 
&gt;against the valves a bit.  Now the valve won't drop into the cyl-
&gt;inder and you can change the stem seals.  Of course, you can't knurl
&gt;the guides, but that's probably OK too...   when done, crank the
&gt;engine back to loosen the rope and pull it out (&quot;You mean you pushed
&gt;it ALL in?  Um... got any tweezers...?&quot;)
&gt;

It should work, especially if you use non-plastic rope. But keep it
clean and make sure you have the cylinder at TDC for that jug.
