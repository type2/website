&gt; Hello vanagon gang,
&gt; I am in the process of removing the interior panels from my vanagon in order

&gt; completely bare, I think I should ask:  has anyone installed a device there
&gt; which makes it possible to open the rear hatch from the inside?


Well done Stuart, getting that crispy peeling &quot;wallpaper&quot; off the inside
and relacing it with something &quot;Rubinesque&quot; (flannel?) is in my big chore jar 
of things I really have to do.

I did install a very sophisticated opening device on my '72 - a short
piece of &quot;stout line&quot; that tied into a spot in the latch mechanism which
had a wee hole in it.


I haven't done this on my '82, but examining the bildkatalog, I think I
can see a lever inside the rear hatch that maybe opens the door. (hows
that for confident advice!)
