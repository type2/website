Subject: Re: EV Parts Hauler...  And animal hauler

Okay, I'll add to the list:  I've used my EV to haul telescopes, camera
gear, and three of the owners of said equipment to photograph Comet
Hyakutake last March in Lockwood Valley.  Plenty of room.  I like being
able to convert from people to cargo (delicate, too) hauler without taking
out the seats.
