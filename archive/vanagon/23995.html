Is that a Bubba window? I'm in Arkansas...where this guy named Bubba is 
famous for his tin-snip windows...built in security against 
vandals...that is, jagged edges...but his prices are right on time. $5; 
plastic and tape run a little extra. If you don't want to get out of your 
car, you can go through the drive-thru. Don't see 'em much in VWs 
though...mostly Ford trucks.

Sorry, it's Friday and I'm a bubba-head today. 8) Joe
