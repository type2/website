Subject: Report: Vanagon Hoses

asked a couple weeks back about sources of Vanagon waterhoses (other than
dealer).  FLAPS were no help for any molded hoses w/in the engine
compartment.  Dealer wants a king's ransom.

so, back to H2O hoses...
i'm hoarding hoses to do a one day swap-ex of rear hoses before summer.

Best answer for hoses i've found so far is a local speciality shop:
Vee Parts in El Cajon (San Diego area).
they order OEM hoses from same wholesaler in LA as dealer (says they) and
don't mark up as high.

e.g.
small molded expansion tank hoses US$26 vs. $36 and $36 vs. $46 (in stock
bought 'em).
large molded sections $57 vs. $76 (got tax check, gonna order 'em)

Background &amp; ramblings:
we had an engine fire in the driveway last December.  thank goodness for
alert neighbors w/ fire bottles.  they knocked it down but the aircleaner
element kept burning till the La Mesa Fire Dept arrived and tore the airbox
out.

i was at work when it blew up (as my wife was starting it w/ 4 kids
strapped in).  I do mean blew up.  KABOOM!  Rattled the neighbors windows
several houses down the street.  Near as i can tell it developed a leak on
the #1 injector short hose between the injector and black ABS fuel fitting.


i got it back on the road in January after multiple wrecking yard runs down
to Otay Mesa for wiring, airbox, relays, deck lid, et al.  Waterhoses held
up but got kinda stressed.

Right inboard CV joint (closest to the heat) failed 2 weeks later).  Boot
looked OK but the grease was cooked to a cake/paste.

i'm still looking for the 1 3/8&quot; double hose coupling w/ the bleeder --
must be a popular item to twist off.  it survived the fire but the bleeder
knob melted off.  haven't been able to find one in any of the local
wrecking yards (dealer wants $46).  i'll probably have to give in pay the
Wolfsburg premium.
