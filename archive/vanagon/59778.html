Subject: 82 gas tank full of crud, anybody steam clean theirs?

Hi Vanagonauts,

I switched out my gas tank when I first bought my vanagon 3 years ago
because its tank was rusted through on top.  It flowed gas during
fillups.  It has been fine since then.  

During the last year I have had to change gas filters 3 times. So today I
cruised around trying to run out of gas.  I then pulled the tank fearing
the worst, thinking my replacement tank was already rusted through like
its predecessor.  I have that job down to about an hour now.  I am happy
to report that the exterior is intact.

Examination of the inside of the tank showed very little rust.  I am
thinking that since this tank had sat in a junkyard that all the rust and
dirt and crap had settled the bottom. It was from a DEISEL which could
explain the crud in the bottom. The guy at the junkyard said to just
filler up the first time you use it, then change your filter . 

Looking inside, there appears to be an area in the bottom of the tank
which is isolated from the main tank.  Kind of a quiet area from which
fuel is drawn.  If you look under your vanagon, you will see it in the
center of your tank.  A circular area which is lower than the bottom of
the tank.  This is where all of the sediment has accumulated.  This was
verified when the last few ounces came out during removal, it was a dark
brown red color, full of chunky debris.  The rest of the inside of the
tank looked pretty good.

Does any one have an effective way of cleaning this lower bottom area?  I
think it is surronded by baffles and probably hard to get at even with a 
steam cleaner.  Does any one know the anatomy of the gas tank inside? 
Will high pressure cleaning it through the gas lines work?  I am thinking
a radiator shop might help.  Any help or ideas welcome.  Thanks.
