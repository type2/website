&gt;   One caveat I have is the manufacturer, Winnebago, who once offered a
&gt;nearly identical unit, called the LeSharo on a Pugeot chassis, in both
&gt;gas and diesel models.  This was the Renault Dauphine of motorhomes.

The Winnebago LeSharo was based on a Renault Traffic van chassis, not
Peugeot. The 2.1l turbo diesel engine used in it also showed up in some
Jeep models back when they were owned by Renault. I recall a panel delivery
version being available for a brief period in the early 1980s.

&gt;    Winnebago seems to be one of  those outfits that would never admit
&gt;they might have screwed up and produced a real dog, judging from former
&gt;LeSharo owner laments and the  weird responses  I've seen from the
&gt;Winnebago rep who sometimes participates in the Compuserve RV Forum.  Her
&gt;comeback to people who might have been burned by them, in lieu of an
&gt;apology or even a bit of sympathy, is to buy a new Rialta!

I understand most of the LeSharo problems were with the Renault diesel
engines. I thought I read about a class action law suite involving about
18,000 vehicles. Many went through several engines.
