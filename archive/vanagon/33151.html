&gt;        Ok, we're chock full of greasy do it yourselfer's here, right?
&gt;Here's my proposal: I hate that dammned connection between the header and
&gt;heater box as much as the next guy. If I knew how, I would get rid of it
&gt;and put in something that'd last longer than 2 weeks. Anybody got any
&gt;ideas?


I used Qualco Exhaust-manifold repair paste (heavy duty muffler paste
sort of, available at Checker/Kragen and other FLAPS), some aluminum
sheet from a hobby shop 0.064&quot; thick and cut to fit; and a couple
of hose clamps to hold it together until the paste set. And afterward--
why take them off?

Worked for me.
