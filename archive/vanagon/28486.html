AU CONTRAIRE!! I have a reprint of one of the German Magazines with
the Crash Tests on the EV...basically it was rated the best in the
European market in head on...but also in the off-center front 
impact, a standard the US manufacturers are fighting to prevent being
done here.

The tests were conducted by the TUV, the German govt' organization,
so are probably much more believable than the manufacturer...

If any one wants a copy let me know, and I can get you some
photocopies...assuming, of course, you can read German.
