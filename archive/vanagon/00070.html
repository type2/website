Subject: Re: Leaking auxiliary heater

The winch is a 4,000 lb portable Warn winch. It weighs 60 to 80 lbs or
something, but I find I can pick it up and use it OK. 

I moved the rear heater over next to the brain in my Westy. This leaves just
enough room for the winch to fit under the back seat. 

The nice thing about this setup is that I can then winch backward or forwards
depending on which way I want to go to get out of the mudhole or whatever.

I attach it with the chains supplied with the winch either to the rear tie
downs on the Vanagon or to two tow hooks I put on the front of the vehicle
underneath up front near the spare tire.
