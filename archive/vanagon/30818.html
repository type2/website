Subject: Stripped bleeder bolt!

When it rains it pours.  I noticed that the coolant fill tank was empty so I
figured I'd look for what was going on--not enough coolant leaking out of
the heads to cause that much of a decline.  I decided to bleed again tonight
and low and behold the bleed screw would not come out--and it wouldn't
tighten down either.  My favorite mechanic had to have done this when I took
it to him for overheating... he was the last one to bleed and fill the system.

So maybe a new engine PLUS a new $350 or more radiator?  Any possible fixes
for this without replacing the radiator?
