Matt--

As I am nowhere near California and am not that familiar with their
rediculous laws, I'm not sure if this helps or not.  My 87 originally
bought, sold, lived its entire life (so far), etc., in Louisiana. 
However, the sticker inside the license plate pull down thing says
&quot;meets USA EPA and California emission standards for 1987 light
trucks&quot;.  Seems to me, that ought to count for something, but then, like
I said, I don't have to fool with that nonsense.
