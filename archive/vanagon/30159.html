Subject: Re: Dilemma solved!?!? (include '83's)

&gt;&gt;RMMW sells an extractor for the 75-82 busses. 

**Is the reference to the '75-'82 years really supposed to indicate the 2.0
liter engine? Or is it an &quot;assumption&quot; that all '83s are water pumpers?**

I only ask due to the potential that I need a muffler for the '83 2.0
Aircooled Van that I drive. Is there a difference between the '82 and the
'83 2.0 aircooled engines?  Most folks seem to feel that the only engine
avialable in '83 was the kittyboxer waterpumper. I suppose that common sense
would be to call RMMW when the time comes for a new muffler. I would beyond
me to start a controversial thread ;)
