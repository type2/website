Yes it is a '53, and bumpers as someone asked are not
available as front is missing, and rear never was on
a '53.  Actually someone had fabbed custon oak rear
bumper suspended on angle iron brackets somewhere along
the way to appease a state inspection probably who
didn't believe it didn't come with a rear bumper.
Bumper maker probably was the one to cut out the rear
fenders for no apparent reason as well as it does have
origional 16&quot; wheels.
