&gt;&gt;From the March 11th Auto Trader:
&gt;
&gt;     1.  Rare 1960 Volkswagen delivery van, doors both sides, all orig., 
&gt;runs good, minimum rust, $4500 obo, days 214-579-7440, eve. 
&gt;214-254-4807. 

What makes it so rare?  Is it a panel or a Kombi or deluxe?  I have seen
both a rare deluxe and a rare Kombi both being double door buses.  But a
double-door panel doesn't seem so rare.

&gt;     2.  1960 Volkswagen Bus, double doors, walk through, most there, 
&gt;less motor, new tranny, straight axles, some body work, very little 
&gt;rust, great restor. project, needs someone w/time, money, TLC, $700 
&gt;nego., new glass tail lenses.  214- 272-7840.

Don't want any hack jobs.

&gt;     Both these vehicles are in the Dallas, Tx area.  Picture of #1 
&gt;shows both sets of doors open and appears to be a bench seat.  Picture 
&gt;of #2 looks like rear wheel arches have been opened to allow bigger rear 
&gt;wheels.


Thanks though for looking.
