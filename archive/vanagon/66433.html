Subject:      Website Update - Stickers

Those stickers made famous by Rex are now shown on my website (at least
most of them - more to be uploaded later).  Also included are the
Westfalia Poptop replacement stickers mentioned awhile back.  Go to the
website address below for directions or go directly to:

Depending on your browser, this page can take time to load up, so please
be patient.  I may be downsizing some gif's and tweeking the page later
this week.
