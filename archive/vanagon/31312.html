&gt; OK, at least get a compression test done, should be over 120-125 and all
&gt; even, max 5-10psi diff.  New is 150-165 psi.  And get the coolant circuit
Their test reads 125-130-125-125...
&gt; pressure tested, for leaks, this may take a while to see a pressure drop, if
&gt; there is one.  Check for whitish crusty buildup around head gaskets (not
&gt; valve cover gaskets!)and big nuts on head.  Check for same under waterpump,
&gt; near its drain vent underneath. This is the minimum for an engine check.  Is
&gt; the coolant blue, VW-Autobahn brand or other less desirable?
I'll have a look at this, although at first check, the engine was 
free of any signs of oil/coolant leaks...
  Have the
&gt; dealer run the VIN #  for recall campaigns and to see if the PO cared enough
&gt; to bring it in for them.  I don't remember there being recalls on the '87
&gt; though :) 
I checked the automatrix recalls - there is a few, but nothing major. 
There are 2 recall decals on the door jamb, so this suggests the PO 
was attentive...
That Fram filter is 99% likely the cause of the oil probs.
After another potential buyer saw the oil light come one, they have 
agreed to change the filter - I'll wait &amp; see...

&gt;           Crawl under and look at the seams where the outer edge of the
&gt; floor joins the corrugated middle section, this ripples up if rust is going
&gt; into the seam.  
This is the one thing that impressed me the most - the body seams are 
like *new* - they are clean and shiny with no wrinkles or rock chips, 
and aside from the side panel where the fridge is, all paint is 
original. The PO had a place in Florida so this may explain the high 
mileage and good body...
Pull up(discreetly) the bit of carpet near the front
&gt; passsenger seat belt anchor bolt, this corner  has a seam that rusts too,
&gt; making the anchor bolt weak.
I'll check this too...
BTW, was there a carpet for the rear area in front of the 
fridge/stove? This one just has the vinyl stuff, which is fine as I'd 
probably cut a piece of carpet &amp; remove it for camping anyway - just 
wondering. 
&gt;           I paid $7K Cdn for my '87 Syncro 7 seater, 120K Km,  then I
&gt; junkyarded a full Westy setup inc. roof/rack for $450US.  Takes a full
&gt; weekend to install the inside stuff, and a body shop to fit the roof. Lot
&gt; less than $12.5K and 4WD too!  You could get a low mileage 1991 Syncro and
&gt; do what I did for about the $12.5K  or less....   especially if you start
&gt; with a 2WD! All vanagon GLs '88+ have the rear Weekender bed/bench.  Add
&gt; curtains, Coleman stove and Koolatron/cooler and camp basic style 'til you
&gt; find a Westy donor for deluxe style. 
I'd love to do this, but my last project (an '82 Scirocco) never got 
the attention it needed, until my wife finally crashed it... (not her 
fault)  :-(  I'm afraid I'd never have the time to do the work needed 
for it.

Thanks again to all for the help!

Shawn
