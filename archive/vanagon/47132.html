Subject: Re: $150 busses and wannabussers, piston slap...

&gt;	So, as I'm beginning to think about T4/EuroVans/Caravelle // whatever,
&gt;what exactly is Piston Slap and what was the problem? I'd look in the
&gt;archives but I don't know how to- instructions on how to get there will 

it's enough to get the Eurovan engines rebuilt/replaced gratis by VW!  An 
'92 was FS here with new factory engine for that reason, and I remember a 
couple of listies talking the same.  Slap is from the bearings at the little 
end of the con-rod going bad, so the piston gets thrown out and clunks 
against the bvearing at top-DC. Can also be caused by piston pins loose in 
piston, the piston is still getting slapped about.  Not good in the long 
run.  Sounds like you are running on poor grade gas with the timing way off. 
 May go away as the engine warms and oil gets up to the piston crowns, watch 
that excuse.

The $150 bus was scooped from under an ex-'79 Westy owner who was forced to 
sell his beloved Westy when on vacate in Colorado. Posted a 'help/FS' to 
list and amazingly....  Salmon bought it for $900, claimed another $1000 to 
ship to PA.  Definately not a newbie, he asked the right questions, problem 
was it needed 3 tires to drive away and he couldn't come up with them as 
quickly as Salmon did. the $150 bought new PS rack/alternator/muffler also.  
Poor guy who got scooped was both peeved and saddened to think his Westy was 
either parted or resold.  Had thought an appreciate listie was getting it.  
bye, tim
