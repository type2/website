  With apologies to Steve Johnson, I'm going to disagree with the notion
  that driving 70 mph wears the engine at the same rate that driving at a
  slower speed &lt;in the same gear&gt; over the same distance for a longer time 
  does.

  While the reciprocating distance travelled by the pistons is identical,
  that is only one component of friction. The amount of force acting on the
  parts to push them together will increase due to higher combustion pressures
  and inertial forces. In the rotating parts, remember that centrifugal
  forces are increasing as the square of rpm!

  The other issue is heat. Horsepower required increases approximately as 
  the cube of speed. Since internal combustion engines are only about 25%
  efficient at their best you are always having to dispose of that other
  75% as waste heat. As you increase your highway speed, the &quot;hot spots&quot;
  in the engine do get hotter and their life is shortened accordingly. 

  The air cooled VW engine generally doesn't fail because of normal wear in  
  the pistons, cylinders and rings. I'd say that the preponderance of failures
  begin at the cylinder head. As many of us have experienced, a broken 
  valve stem or a dropped valve seat can quickly turn into a ruined piston
  and cylinder but it's more a consequence than a cause. Assuming that the 
  engine isn't pinging or detonating, the routine disposal of waste heat 
  is likely to be the major factor in engine life as determined by the
  cylinder head.

  All that said, I usually drive the '74 at 60 to 65 mph on the freeway. The
  engine seems &quot;happy&quot; there and there may be some element of safety in 
  keeping up with the flow of traffic. I resist the argument that a lot of
  time is saved by driving faster. It's the average speed over distance 
  that determines how long  the trip takes and adding 5 or 10 mph over a 
  portion of a trip to work has little affect on average speed when compared
  to sitting at zero miles per hour for several minutes because of bad luck
  with traffic signals. We've all been in the situation where someone blasts
  past at high speed only to be revisited at the next red light.

  On a long highway trip where several hours can be spent at higher speed
  the difference can become significant, but it's still likely to be 
  measured in minutes and an extra gas or bathroom stop can cancel out the 
  gain entirely.


  One last plug for safety. The kinetic energy of a moving vehicle increases
  as the square of speed. This energy, all of it, has to be dispersed in a 
  collision. An accident at 70 mph is going to be much more severe than one
  that occurs at 55 mph..

  Sorry if this sounds like pontification, but I am still troubled by the
  cavalier attitude that the public, in general, has towards the safety of 
  those they share the roads with.

  Now having drifted a long way from engine wear,

  Dave Kautz
