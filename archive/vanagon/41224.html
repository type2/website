Subject: Need help rebuilding engine
Date: Fri, 3 May 1996 06:39:44 -0700

Everyone,

I just bought a 70 Type  II that will need an engine this summer.  Muir =
and I will be doing the rebuild.  I expect it to take all summer.  I've =
never done anything like this, but I'm going to anyway.  I'll be posting =
to this list a lot more than usual, for advice.  QUESTION  Would any one =
be interested in helping with specific questions?   I don't want to post =
every little Q to the list.  I'd like to comunnicate directly to several =
members regarding the diffferent situations that I'll be getting myself =
into.  Then,  if it warrants posting, I'll post the procedure/ problem =
to the list as a whole.

My greatest difficulty other than lack of brain cells is that my local =
FLAPS is a 180 mile round trip from where I live.  Ordering parts for a =
rebuild seems like a formidable challenge.  I know from prev experience =
with FLAPS and parts in general, that at least 1/3 of the parts will be =
wrong, size, type or orientation. Anybody got a solution for my location =
problem....DON&quot;T SAY MOVE!!

Please respond to   mchowser_at_3rivers_dot_net

Tnx
