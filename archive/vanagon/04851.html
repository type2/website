&gt; Then I noticed that the trans/engine seam is more than a black line.  It's
&gt; maybe 1/8 inch open.  Maybe even 3/16.  This is a new one on me (and was the
&gt; problem of course) -- I've never had the four big engine mounts loosen up on
&gt; me, but they'll sure get locktighted from now on.

	Mmmm. That's a strong pressure plate!!:-)
