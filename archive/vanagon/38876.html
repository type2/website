Subject: spark plug orientation affects performance?

I read somewhere that it may be advantageous to install spark plugs so
that their open end faces the intake valve.  This can be achieved with the
help of washers. This is to prevent the spark from occuring in the shadow 
created by the electrode. Comments?
