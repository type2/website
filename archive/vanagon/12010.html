Subject: Name that engine...

Well, I finally pulled the '74 Camper out of the garage after a ten year
hibernation. My dad had put it in there when he gave up on the beast after
continual problems finally culminated in a fit of frustration when the
engine supposedly died.  I don't think he ever found out EXACTLY what the
problem was, but he just didn't want the hassle anymore.

Anyway, we're trying to figure out what kind of engine is in it. It's not
the original engine, and my friend seems to think it's something unusual.
Maybe someone can give me some clues:

First of all, I wasn't able to match the chasis number with any of the
numbers listed in Muir's book.  According to the book, there are no Type
II's for the 1974 model year, however the chasis number on my camper is:

                                 234 2109 986
It is definitely a '74 camper.

Can anyone explain this??

Secondly, the engine block is blue. Its code doesn't match any of the
engine codes listed in Muir's book either:

                Engine code: AW-A
                Engine size: 109 CID

Can anyone give me any info on what kind of engine this is??

Thanks for any help...

Ben
