Where do you go camping?
I'd like to see the leaping mice.

&gt; Often when I go camping I have problems with mice getting into my
Westfalia.
&gt; I've sealed the front air vents with wire mesh, so I don't think they can
&gt; enter that way anymore. The last trip I took, I observed the varmits
&gt; blatantly leaping in the open sliding door! I really don't like to keep
my
&gt; van closed up all the time when camping so I need some way to keep these
&gt; pests out. I'm thinking about trying one of those ultrasonic pest
repellant
&gt; devices, but I'm skeptical as to whether they will really work. Has
anyone
&gt; tried these devices before? I guess I could start taking a cat with me...
