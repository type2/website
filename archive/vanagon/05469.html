Subject: Rear heater controlls?

Quick question:

The rear heater controlls on Matilda, the '71 Bus, are an enigma to me.

Which way on and which way off?

Together = On? 
Both right = On?

Whats up?

I cant mess around, becuase I cant feel the air at idle, either way,
and I have the middle seat puched back, blocking access, so I want
to minimize the time spent standing on my head in the back seat.
