Some Info for U all:

I had the Problem: 

After warming Up my 2.5 oettinger WBX with a Digijet, the power and idle
goes away and the engine dies. I start it again, it runs fine, after 1
or 2 minutes, the same problem. ??? I checked all items and change the
temp sensor. No diffrent... HMM after thinking a lot, I called a friend
and he said: Put the ECU so far away from the ignition and coil as the
cable is long. 

Btw. I must say the WBX is not in a vanagon, I put it in my thing, so my
fault was to install the ECU near by the ignition. And what shall I say,
thats the problem, I installed it now 25 cm away on the other side of
the motorspace - inside of the car! It works fine!
