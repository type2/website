Subject:  removing the fan housing, engine in car?

Well I finally got the thermostat parts that the dread
PPO (aren't they usually worse than the PO?) removed from
my bus. (though I still need a return spring and some of those
little clips that hold the connecting rod on, anyone
have any of these?)

My question is, can I remove the fan housing to install
these parts without removing the engine from my bus ('62),
or is it just too big a pain?
-----------
I dont mind changing a generator in a split screen engine in car.  Find it
easier.    Unless thermostat is hooked up/ and/or doghouse cooler.   With
doghouse, the carb needs to come off, too.  I generally leave off bottom left
10mm bolt holding gen tin onto fan shround.  Do not use sheet tin screws.

BUT.........
 not for hooking up thermostat.  Take it out.  BTW, how old are yor main and
cooler oil seals?  Nows a good time to change them.  I'd take the bus to the
car wash first and give the engine a good wash.  A clean engine is a happy
engine .  *)
