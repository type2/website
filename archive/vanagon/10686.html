Subject: Re: grinding noise over speed bumps
Date: Thu, 26 Jan 95 15:35:14 PST

&gt; 
&gt; I was somewhat in a hurry the other day (the St.Louis Blues were to play
&gt; against Vancouver), when I swooshed over a slight depression in the road,
&gt; forcing the bus onto its knees (Heee Haw!!). Since then, everytime I take
&gt; a speed bump, I hear this grinding noise (Knarren und Knirschen) from the
&gt; front left wheel well. Any ideas what part got damaged, if it requires
&gt; attention, and how much effort (time and money) it takes to fix the problem?

  Maybe one of the shock absorbers is making the noise. At least they are
  cheap and easy to change. 

  BTW, I'll see Cap'n Hook's hundred and raise him another $200.OO. You could
  be rid of the Knarren and Knirschen and have 3 crisp C-notes in your pocket.

  Always willing to &quot;help&quot;,
