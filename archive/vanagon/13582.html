Subject: re: :) Jettas


	I'll probably get flamed for this, but...so what. Someone else 
started this, and I can't help but join the fray.

	Understand- I love the Beetle and the Microbus- I'd own a dozen 
if I had the space- that doesn't mean that time stopped when they were 
designed. And I shudder to think about a time when the friendly sound 
of an air-cooled flat four isn't heard all over town. But I own a 
Beetle for the same reason I keep my old Apple II in the closet- it 
has character, and it helped change the world. Not because nothing 
better has followed it.

	New Volkswagens are radically different than old Volkswagens, 
but I like 'em both, for very different reasons. 
	
	Arguments about what makes &quot;real&quot; Volkswagens are dull, and in 
my mind they miss a number of points. Here's a few of those points...

1. The argument that VWs used to be cheap, and now they aren't, is 
not really correct. My father bought a '58 Beetle brand new when 
he was in grad school, and I think he paid about $1750 for it. 
Corrected for almost *four decades* of inflation, I'd imagine that 
wouldn't seem so cheap today. An economist could tell you for sure, 
but I'd bet that a base Golf III today doesn't cost much more in *real 
dollars* than the Beetle did back then. Yes, there are &quot;upscale&quot; VWs 
now, which there weren't then, but so what? If you don't want 'em, 
don't buy 'em.

2. Escalating regulatory requirements in the last 30 years would have 
*forced* VW to evolve much as they have even if the market didn't-and 
I'll get to that in a minute. Emission controls are a huge part of 
this; the &quot;ecological&quot; image of the VW comes from when it stood in 
comparison to to the Detroit Iron of the '60s. My '69 Beetle puts out 
150 ppm of hydrocarbons at idle, with Calfornia allowing as much as 
700 ppm for that year. My '87 GTI puts out 5 ppm of HC at idle- that's 
almost NINETY-SEVEN PERCENT fewer emissions than the Beetle! The air 
here in California is brown enough as it is- I'm willing to say that I 
think emissions controls have been a good thing.

3. The &quot;added complication&quot; of modern VW's has meant incredible gains 
in fuel economy. Again, late Beetles could get around 25 to 30 mpg 
with a nominally 50 hp engine. My '87 GTI gets better mileage from an 
engine capable of putting out TWICE the horsepower, with far better 
longevity.

4. Face it folks, we who love air-cooled VWs are *not* a majority, at 
least here in the US of A. This blasphemy isn't mine- it's the MARKET, 
folks. Look back at the early 70's- if you have a strong stomach- and 
look at total sales figures and market share in the US car market. 
Please understand- I abhor most Japanese cars of the era, and I'm not 
fond of 'em today- but they are what people wanted to buy! Sales of 
the Beetle plunged, and sales of Japanese imports surged. The Beetle 
was and is a great car design, but VW stayed with it too long. People 
voted with their dollars- and the majority didn't vote for the Beetle.

5. Yes, VW has never recovered its US market share since the hey-day 
of the Beetle, but Europe is a different story. The first, second, and 
now third generations of the Golf have all been *best sellers* in 
Europe- where, again, demand for the Beetle plunged in the '70s. 
Apparently VW still represents quality and value in it's home country 
and the rest of Europe. This has remained true for two decades of 
water-pumpers.

6. Arguments such as &quot;you can't get a Jetta engine out and on the 
bench in 45 minutes&quot; are silly. Much of what has complicated the 
engine bay is required for emission control- VW had no choice in that. 
More over, in my opinion, it's a lot less important how easy it is to 
get a Golf or Jetta engine out because you don't *have* to do it 
nearly as often! So it takes longer- so what? Our whole world is more 
complicated than it used to be; better in many ways, worse in some. 
I've driven my GTI for eight and a half years, and other than a water 
pump, a muffler, and two CV joints all it's had is routine 
maintenance. No points to set, no carb to adjust, no valve 
adjustments, just lots of Fahrvergnugen, or however the heck it's 
spelled.

	I'm glad that automotive engineering didn't stop in 1948, 
1957, or whenever. I want to see old VW's preserved for their unique 
character and history. But the engineering advances of the last 30 years 
or more have given me cars that are more economical, safer, less harmful 
to the environment, with better performance. 
	
	And the ones that I like are still *VOLKSWAGENS*! 

	Peace,
