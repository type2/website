I've tried getting replacements for older transistors, and what I learned 
was that the market back in the late 60's early 70's was very volitile. 
The numbers and letters on the transistor case are date a batch codes 
specific to that manufacturer. What you need is the schematic. Assuming 
it's a TO-3 power transistor, it's probably a germanium type, which isn't 
made any more. To-3 types have the metal oval shaped cases with 2 mounting 
holes. It's also probably an NPN type also, since PNP power transistors 
weren't as available back then. You can substitute a modern silicon type, 
but get one that's really low performance, because the feedback loop 
won't be able to handle the realatively extreme speed of modern devices. 
Make sense? Take the transistor to a wholesale electronics dealer, the 
ones located in industrial parks, and plead for help.
