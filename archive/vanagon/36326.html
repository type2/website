&gt;Darned tootin' and you know another way might be --- but honey with just a
&gt;little more work you could have this for your very own!  :-)


Could be a viable tack. But, if she then says something like, How come
the little mirror in the visor, isn't lit up? ...then it might take more 
work
than you originally thought.

And if she asks, &quot;What's that extra pedal next to the brake for?&quot;, then
you have a loooonnggg week ahead of you.
