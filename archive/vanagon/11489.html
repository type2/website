&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So Joel Walker says:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that I shall never see
&gt;&gt;&gt; An auto that appeals to me
&gt;&gt;&gt; As much as a Volkswagen Bus.
&gt;&gt;&gt; A car designed, without much fuss,

To which Ralf MacGrady added:
&gt;   To be much more comfortable than a truss.
&gt;

at least more so than a camel's back.
Coz what do they know, Klick and Klack?

Hey! Just my 2 cents' worth,
Joachim
