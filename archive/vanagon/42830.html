Subject: Importing Van from Canada

I need some help and I can't seem to find the right place to get it so
I'm asking for your help please. I am investigating the importing of a
Westfalia van from Alberta, Canada to Montana, USA. Will vans sold in
Canada from 1980 to 1990 meet US EPA and DOT standards for US
importation? Maybe you might know or direct me to someone who might.
Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide.
