&gt; Re: grab it at $1500 -- that number looked pretty good to me, too; seems
&gt; like somebody could hot up a Rabbit Pickup with it.  But if you Syncro
&gt; people are going to be so nitpicky (no rework of the back deck, no re-
&gt; duced ground clearance, no elimination of the engine skid plate, heck
&gt; you prob'ly still want the exhaust to come out the back instead of the
&gt; front) you're going to be driving horizontally opposed flat fours your
&gt; whole life.

HA! Flat fours. As my grandmother used to say: &quot;I'll fix your wagon&quot; :-)

You know that the 3.2 Porsche six requires no modications to the
deck lid or ground clearance. So there. We *do* have an option other than
&quot;horizontally opposed flat fours&quot;.
