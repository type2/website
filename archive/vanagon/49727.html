Richard,
	Maybe the catalytic converter is ready to let go.  When mine went
bad it sounded like the element was rotating inside.

&gt;Hi Guys,
&gt;
&gt;My 86 GL make a buzzing noise that I hear somewhaere near the engine 
&gt;when I
&gt;accelerate onto the highway or when I really give her some gas.  There 
&gt;is
&gt;no noticable performance problem.  It sounds like an insect buzzing 
&gt;againt
&gt;a window. I wonder if it's the fuel pump working hard or maybe the 
&gt;sound of
&gt;the fuel injector control (first time I've had FI).
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
