Subject: Question: ...releasing clutch and *CLUNK-INK noise occurs

Working out some bugs in the syncro and was curious if an audio
definition of a problem would garner a few answers...

Looking to locate/resolve a &quot;clunk-ink&quot; or a &quot;clunk-ink-ink&quot; that occurs
in the powertrain during 1st gear clutch release/acceleration. Not
everytime, but especially when I'm easing out with very little gas.

I have a leaking (probably dry by now) CV boot on the rear right wheel,
and no obvious play in the long drive shaft's joints. The sound reminded
me of the noise an old U-joint makes when engaging. Had a 78 Dodge 4wd
that made a similar noise, but it was so ugly (and a diesel to boot!)
that I just considered it a &quot;rough, Alaskan, mean-ass Truck noise.

Any obvious points you might suggest? (I know that repairing the CV &amp;
boot is a priority) I guess I just want someone to say: &quot;Mine made the
same noise and it was the CV joint and went away forever when I replaced
it.&quot; or &quot;Tighten your driveshaft bolts to 50 ft/lbs and it disappears&quot;

Anything similar?
