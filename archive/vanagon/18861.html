Subject: [?]/Strange American VWVan Look-alike


So, I'm driving down the street when I see this old flat-faced Van, of 
American marquee (I know not which).  Then I notice that there are vents 
towards the back of it.  Then I notice that it's a rear-engined beast and 
sounds very much like an old Corvair (!).     

What Gives?

Part Two, from the Local Freak Department:  A guy with gravel, of all 
different colors/shapes, in neat patterns, imbedded into his 1971 VWBug (!).
He sez:  &quot;I plan to turn the interior (i.e., the back seat) into a 
terrarium (!).&quot;
