Subject: don'know much about aerodynamics

.. but I know that replacing the missing panels behind the grill on my 81
Vanagon made a big difference in how much air comes through the fresh air
system at highway speeds.  For those of you who haven't looked, the fresh
air intake only uses about 1/5 of the area of the grill.  The rest is supposed
to be blocked off by waterproof cardboard pieces that fall off and disappear
unless the spare tire catches them.

MY question about aerodynamics is whether the driprails at the sides of the
windshield contribute disproportionately to wind noise.  I almost got up the
nerve to cut 'em off before I had the van painted.
