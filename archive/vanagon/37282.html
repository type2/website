So get this.  A friend of mine, who had a bug called Booger, developed
Hodgkin's disease, cancer of the lymph glands, and went to Arizona where the
climate's kinder and the specialists were, to get chemotherapy.  She had a
doctor there she had a good rapport with (the kind that actually listens and
talks to you - a rare animal).   A couple weeks ago she got a letter from him
saying he would give her his 1960 vw camper bus.  happy happy joy joy.!!!!
  He was getting a Porsche and only had garage space for eight cars, and knew
she liked old vws.  Needless to say, she was estatic.  Besides which, she had
sold Booger, ugly but reliable, and had gotton a fastback, ugly and broken.
  The bus needed bodywork, but ran great.

 Then yesterday, she got another letter, saying he wanted $7000 for it.   :(
  Geez
As he had put $12,000 into it including $500 for engine cosmetic work, etc.

But she wants to stay on good terms in case it comes out of remission.
