&gt; I just read a post concerning having to buy more than one CD-ROM for
&gt; each car you have.  Well, that could get expensive if you have a few
&gt; automobiles.  So, someone should sell these things and make them
&gt; customizable.  Say you have a '78 bus, an '89 4Runner and a '95 Neon. 
&gt; Instead of buying three separate CD-ROMS, one with all VWs ever made,
&gt; one with all Toyotas ever made and one with all Dodges ever made, just
&gt; get one CD-ROM with only the information that you need for the models
&gt; you have.  

Are you familiar with CD-ROM mastering?  Massive amounts of data transfer?

It might be possible to make a WORM/CD-R like this, but its not as simple
as copying a file.  There's indexing to consider.  Unless you had a product
database with everything all indexed and ready to go, and just copied
the ones they wanted.  Man what a lot of work. (computer-wise)  It would
take a couple hours just to create the master-image for your bus/roadrunner/neon
disk, another 15-20 minutes to burn it, and then they'd have to delete
the master to start over again for the guy who wants the yugo/skoda/citroen
disk.  Thats probably a total of 3-4 hours per disk, once you include QC,
shipping, etc.
