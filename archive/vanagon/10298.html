&gt; Quick suggestion for pushing the pistons back in the callipers. I
&gt; found a 6&quot; &quot;C&quot; clamp at a yard sale once. Whenever I need to push
&gt; the pistons back into the calliper, I put the stationary end of the
&gt; clamp on the calliper opposite the piston and the screw part of
&gt; the clamp onto or into the piston and then crank away! It pushes
&gt; in even the most stubborn piston...and does not chew up the
&gt; surface of the piston like a pair of pliers or grips might.

This is what I've always done, and I has never let me down, except
for the time I worked on a friend's Subaru, which we found later
wants the pistons screwed back in instead of pushed........
