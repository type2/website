Subject: redrock


I've been preoccupied in the last few days, but have noticed
amongst the prune posts that a few people have made suggested alternative
camping sites to Red Rock.  As I am from the middle rather than
the southern end of California, and do not know the locations
in question, I don't have a vested interest in one versus 
the other.  But since David Schwarze has gone to all the trouble
to research this, suggest it, find out about it for us, and
also write the letter Ranger Rick or whatever his name is, I suggest
that we all stand behind the idea, be supportive, be decisive,
stick with it and simply choose to take the stand for this
location.

After all, there are LOTS of days left in the future to make
further excursions, and I for one look forward to many many
vanagon.lenti prune/flannel bashes in the years to come.  Further,
if any of you would like to visit the other nearby areas of
interest, you could always do so by taking a side excursion
from our trip, and/or by doing it a day ahead or after our
planned meet.

I guess this is to serve as my formal solid vote for sticking
with Red Rock.  Count me in:  I'll be there with Margeritas
in hand!
