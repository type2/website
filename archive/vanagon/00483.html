&gt;Isn't 67mph at 4000 rpm kind of slow?

well, that's what my bus works out to ... the speedometer shows as being
off a couple of mph (according to the calibrated trip computer ... which
i think i trust more. i've checked the speedometer and the trip computer
with a stop watch and the trip computer is closer to correct &lt;i think&gt;).

and i calculated a figure of 16.75 mph per 1000 rpm for my bus, based on
all that garbage i did, running up and down the highway. i figure it's
tires, friction losses, wind resistance, etc. that makes the difference.
