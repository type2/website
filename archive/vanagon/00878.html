Subject: exhaust pipes

here i am, a newcomer to your group and already demanding information!
anyhow,  hello!   As the owner of a LOUD '85 H2O boxer I wonder if anyone 
has any alternative supplier for vanagon exhaust pipes, (3 pcs, front, rear 
and side). These cost over $1000 CDN, and I've stretched my home-brew system 
out as long as I can stand. Is there a J-tube system like the old beetles, 
(2 J's + muffler) listed for any other VW that someone has managed to 
shoe-horn into position ? Is there anything!?  thanks all.   tim s.
