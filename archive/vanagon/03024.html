Subject: RE: Kendall oil ... an opinion


I seem to vaguely remember that there was some connection between 
Kendall and Amalie motor oils.  Like, maybe the companies merged 
and these are the same oils.  Maybe that they used the trade name 
Kendall in the north and east, but Amalie in the south or midwest 
(I don't recall ever seeing Kendall in Texas, but I usually don't
look for it;  maybe in some big national chains like KMart). 
Sort of like Schiling and McCormick spices, or Best Foods and
Hellman's mayonaise. 

Also, I remember seeing this company's refinery in Bradford, PA 
(home of Zippo lighters).  If I remember, the Kendall and Amalie 
names/logos were both emblazoned on various tanks.

Amalie used to have an advertising jingle on their TV ads:
	&quot;Better than it has to be ...
	 Amalie.&quot;

Yeah, it was pretty weak. :)
