&gt; I was wondering if any other Syncro owners experience hard shifting while
&gt; driving in the snow.   After driving on snow covered roads for any length of
&gt; time, a large accumulation of road &quot;slush&quot; builds up between the rear
&gt; section of the shift linkage and the main chassis member. It seems as though
&gt; there should be some sort of shield or plate to prevent the build up. I had
&gt; a 1987 Westy manual trans. and I don't seem to remember any shifting
&gt; problems, though it's possible that it happens on the syncro and non syncro
&gt; versions. Any insight would be helpful.

Kris,
We had exactly the same problem at the beginning of winter. Most Vanagon
Listees suggested that we install flaps to prevent &quot;slush&quot; build up. We
haven't done anything yet and will look into it this summer.
In the meantime, we discovered that most of the shifting problem was
caused by slush, road sand and ice forming at the sleeves where the
linkage passes through the support members. To reduce this problem, we
have cleaned up these points and lubed the shafts. The best lubricant
we've found so far is a copper based anti-seize compound called
&quot;Coppaslip&quot; applied on the shaft is a thin smooth coat. This stuff will
not wash off and doesn't accumulate grit.

Good luck,
Larry and Avery
