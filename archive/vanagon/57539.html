Probably the control unit.  You can keep screwing around with it or do
what I did.  Put a red led on the low pressure switch.  This led MUST go
off when the car is running.  Put a green led on the high pressure switch.
This led MUST BE ON above idle.  In fact, on my '88 with 95k miles it's
&quot;mostly on&quot; at idle.  Just a barely noticible flicker.  I trust what I
can see far more than than that stupid dynamic oil pressure monitor
circuit.
