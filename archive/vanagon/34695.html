Hey all,
	Well, today is the day.  I went to check out that 1978 bus that
	I had written about before.  Checked compression, brakes, all
	that.  Everything was cool and checked out OK.  Also seems that
	it doesn't have as much wrong with it as I thought.  Wipers are
	working fine, I think maybe the reason it appeared they didn't
	work too well before was because I tried them with the engine
	off, just key on.  Speedometer still doesn't work tho.  Turn
	signals and all that work if you jiggle the hazard flasher
	switch just right.  It's got a nice stereo that he put in and
	the A/C works.  All I need to do is adjust those brakes and fix
	that speedometer and I should be set as far as the major stuff
	goes.  It's just a cool bus!  Anyway, just thought you'd all
	like to know -- also, still has original owner's manual and
	emission booklet and all that.  Neat.

	That's a '78 bus, Fredericksburg, VA

	Sean
