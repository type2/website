Subject: Best rear hatch rubber 71 bus?

Hi folks,

I'm finally buying much needed rear hatch rubber.  I'd like to buy from West
Coast Metric since I've purchased some good rubber from them in the past
(engine compartment, front windshield, accel pedal boot), however they sell
two rear hatch types: the German rubber is $89 and the WCM made is $58
(these were the prices when I checked a few months back).  The phone person
said that the WCM brand is the same quality as the German so my question is
what have people bought and had success with (i.e. fit, durability,
sealing)?  I'm tempted just to get the German to avoid possible fit problems
or premature deterioration, but I don't want to write off a good, less
expensive alternative.

Thanks for any advice/persuasions,
