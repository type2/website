Subject: Re: VW issue Vanagon floor mats $10.00

&gt;All,
&gt;
&gt;I was in Young VW in Easton,  PA this weekend and lo-and-behold
&gt;sitting in a corner were five sets of VW issue floor mats [front]
&gt;with the Vanagon name across the high wear area for $10.00  a set.
&gt;The number there is 610-253-6244,  the parts guy is ok for a parts
&gt;guy,  I'm pretty they will send them to you.  If not,  stop by,  I
&gt;think thursday is their late night,  they are only open 'til 11:00
&gt;am on saturday.

Anyone wants to buy my 81 Westie - Felix, I'll throw in the original
Vanagon floor mats free!')  These babies wear like iron.
