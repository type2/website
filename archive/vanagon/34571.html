Subject: synthetic tranny oil?


Recently, I replaced my 87 syncro tranny with a rebuilt unit.  I am coming 
up on 1000 miles on the new unit and considering changing the tranny oil to 
remove any chips, badness from the break in of new parts in the rebuilt 
unit.  Two questions:

1.  is this really necessary/recommended?
2.  if yes, would replacing with synthetic tranny oil enhance shifting, esp. 
in cold weather and also last longer since it doesn't (?) breakdown as 
quickly as dino oil.

In the recent discussion of synth oil for engine I saw some words about 
increasing the likely hood of gasket leaks.  Would this be reduced by having 
new gaskets in with the new tranny?

thanks,
Fred Porter
87 Syncro
