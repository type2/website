Subject: '77 automatic 7-pass, revisited

Well, I drove it on Saturday, and overall, I was pretty impressed. My wife
liked it, so that's a plus. The only problems I noticed were that it idles
really low, so that at a standstill or at speeds less than 1 or 2 mph, it
stalls, and at highway speeds, it hesitates. It feels like it's trying
desparately to go faster, but it just can't do it. The (soon to be) PO is
selling it for $900, which for the condition of the bus seems like an
excellent deal. But, judging from the problems I've mentioned, does anyone
think that I'm in store for a lot of repairs on this one, or do they sound
relatively minor? 
TIA for your help.
