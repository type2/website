Subject: how to buy a clutch cable


I mentioned in a previous post that I took an 8K trip this summer in my
'66 Westphalia with a stock 1600 that I rebuilt myself right before I took
off.  I learned some interesting lessons and found some good vw parts
places along the way.  Now that I am *more or less* settled I thought I
would share my experiences, a little at a time. 

The only significant mechanical problem I had was a broken clutch cable as
I was humping up a ballbusting hill just outside of Pendleton, Oregon en
route to my old hometown of Boise.  I made it to the conveniently located
rest area at the top of the hill, and thus set about replacing the cable
with my spare. Unfortunately, the adjusting wing nut on the old cable was
stripped beyond belief and impossible to remove. It was only then that I
noticed that the only thing you get when you buy a new cable is...the
cable.  No replacement wing nut, and no extra pin which connects the cable
to the clutch pedal.  Damn it. 

So I replace the cable anyway, except for the adjusting nut, and drive
with no clutch (thank god for synchromesh gears) to Boise, where I picked
up a new clutch cable...and a spare wingnut (.50 cents) and bemis pin
(another .50 cents). 

*Now* I'm prepared.  My advice is to get those items to carry with your 
spare, too.

Incidentally, don't expect to find any vw parts between Pendleton and 
Boise.  In Boise, Bow Wow Auto Parts is highly recommended.  The guys 
there are friendly and know their shit.
