You guys will never believe this one :-)

Flipping thru the new Newsweek, on page 15 there is an Iomega ad, which
you've probably already seen:

Top half shows wide-eyed kid in driver's seat with caption &quot;You've got
insurance if Johnny crashes the company car.&quot;

Then the lower part shows same kid with caption &quot;But what if he crashes
the company computer?&quot; and then says why you should buy a ZipDrive or
something.

Anyway, I was looking closely at the car Johnny is driving and I notice
the interior looks really familiar.  Then I notice it's a Vanagon!
First I noticed the steering wheel, then I looked at the door shape,
which is definitely Vanagon, as tipped off by the black trim at the rear
of the door and the loose rubber molding strip at the top of the vent
wing pillar.  You can also see the standard VW coathook mounted on teh
door pillar, and the headliner is Vanagon, you can see the screws at the
rear and the &quot;track&quot; it slides into.  

I thought it was kinda neat!

Sean
