Just got my brosure after given them a call for info.  I asked
if it could cure flannel.  There was only silence on the other
end of the line. ;)  Anyway, EXPENSIVE!!!  They must think I own
a EV with Winnebago conversion or something. ;)  But... I might
try one with further input from some others that actually use it.  I
don't do much cookin' other than the pan and grill type.  Hmmm...
Thanksgiving on the coast at Pfieffer?  Oh yeah....   Just as long
as there ain't no Cara.... well you know the type, present. ;p

Oh, they also sent along a small brosure that's tryin' to get ya
to buy a teepee with a woodstove for $1,700.00 !!  Hey John! 
Maybe you can hall that in your Cara-ahem.....   van.  ;)
