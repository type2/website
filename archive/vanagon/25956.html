&gt;        I have two vehicles fully insured in Christchurch, New Zealand and
&gt;a '67 bus with minimum coverage in Arizona.  I pay less annually for the
&gt;two in NZ than the crappy coverage in AZ for 6 months.  Gary Gibson

Seriously, how much personal-injury coverage do you carry in NZ?
And how much collision? (Damage to your car)?
