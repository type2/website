My 81 Vgon has been Porsche-powered for two years now -- I year at 125hp
(2.2l) and one year at 158hp (2.7l).  Also almost 2 months at 180hp (3.0l).
I haven't had any transmission trouble, and (knock wood) don't really ex-
pect any.  I drive very reasonably, taking advantage of the hp primarily
in higher gears.  I am using the stock VW clutch, so I picture that if there
is to be a problem, it'll be the clutch.  

With a turbo engine, or taking a party of seven out drag racing, I could 
foresee a problem with the stock transmission.  Somewhere along the $ con-
tinuum of Porsche engines, it gets smart to put the Porsche G50 5-speed in
along with your 3.6liter turbo.  Then you can worry about the CV joints,
I guess.
