Subject: ADVICE: Would This be a Wise Purchase/Good Deal?

Hello,

I'm soliciting help from the list in my assessment of a possible purchase.  I 
know there's a lot of opinions/talent out there, in providing this type of 
advice, and I do appreciate it!  (tia)

Here's the deal:

It's a 67 standard microbus, complete, walk-thru, small amount of surface rust 
in problem areas only (floorboards, etc.), body straight, except for crinkles 
on LH side/rear, due to its skidding on its side.  (it sounds worse than it 
actually looks!)

New tires and steering box, and apparently the engine runs OK.

He wants $650.

*My* only possible hesitation here is the side damage (and any secondary 
damage that may have caused).  Do I need to be &quot;skittish&quot; about a bus which 
has taken a tumble like this (i.e., bent frame or other horrors not outwardly 
apparent?).

What's the consensus from the list?  Would &quot;the list&quot; have any hesitation?  (I 
haven't driven it yet)

Again, thanks in advance...
