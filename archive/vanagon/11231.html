Ok, a few things.
Thom should be able to charge his 12 Volt deep cycle by
making a voltage doulber, right?
I've heard they are pretty ineffecient, but oh well.

The second thing has something to with my fuel injection.
 
Ittermittetly, it misses a beat, and like 'stops', but
then will go again.  lately the stops have been lasting more
than the goes.

Some have suggested that this is the wiring to the double relay or
perhaps the air flow sensor?

I have had someone wiggle all the wires they can reach while I was
drivine to try and pin point what was going on, but they couldn't
get it to do it.  Then it started doing it right after putting the
hatch back on.  

It also seems only to do it under acceleration, and seems to go away
under full/high throttle positions, and also after the bus has been
running for some time.

Perhaps its the ignition coil? Rotor/cap?

It really has me tyotally perplexed.  I am planning on going through
the wiring harness and try and find any cracked wires/connectors,

perhaps replace the coil? (how can I check the coil?)
and rotor/cap (for sure, it needs it anyway)

Anyone have any hints at all for this?  I would like to have it running
reliabley by this weekend so that we can take it to a hockey game so
that I can take this extremely attractive young woman etc etc :)

If anyone has any ideas they could mail me, I would be very happy.
Alternately, if anyone has any suggestions for improving my spelling,
I would appreciate that as well.

Ta Ta
Matt
