Subject: '68 front-end into '59 Bus? Disc brakes?

I recently acquired a '68 parts bus. My question is: can I use this
ball-joint front end on 
my '59? Someone told me yesterday that I could. I also have a '73 parts van,
can I use the disc brakes from that beam on the '68/'59? Any response is
greatly appreciated.
TIA,
Josh
