Well for those of us aren't 1200 miles away (and even for those who are, 
if they're REALLY keen), how about arranging a camping trip down that way 
sometime?  It'd be cool: we could camp at and explore Mt. St. Helens 
(which is real close), then spend an afternoon cleaning out the junk yard 
of all their VW bus stuff.  This all depends on a favourable review of 
the yard by someone in advance, of course.
