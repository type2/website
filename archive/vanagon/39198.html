Subject: Re: Removing very old stickers from glass.How?

To make removal a little easier heat the sticker with a blow dryer and it
should come off with a razor blade before you know it. If the razor blade's
in good shape you should get it off without a scratch.

As for the Deadhead stickers try your local Best Buy. It seems that since
Jerry's death all that stuff has gone so mainstream that they've opened up
Deadhead boutique areas (yuck!).
