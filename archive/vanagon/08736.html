I think that woudl be the way to go. Individual contributions can be
written in hypertext, with the option of including pictures (graphs and
photos). Then you simply amend it to an existing homepage. After a year or
so, there should be enough material to be edited into an actual paperback. The
editing, of course, would be the toughest job; but definitely doable. 

I also like the idea of the publication being in the ring binder format. A
new volume could be published every year and then amended, chapter by
chapter, to the previous ones. Obsolete information can then also be
substituted with better info.
