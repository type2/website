Subject: Re: Leakin' oil


&gt;I'd noticed before (and I checked then, believe me!) that the oil level
&gt;was dropping a lot faster than normal.  I'd say Peter Lima's description
&gt;of &quot;dripping oil like a seive&quot; describes our situation pretty well.
&gt;
&gt;Total repair cost?  Zero.  Time invested in repair?  Maybe 12 seconds.
&gt;Problem?  Oil filter unscrewed and was nearly ready to fall off!


What's an oil filter?
