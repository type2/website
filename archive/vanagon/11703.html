Dear Tom, and All--
During the course of refuelling each of the Vanagons in our fleet, I've 
found that gas spillage happens in every one of them. But in refuelling 
about a month ago I discovered something by serendipity (I had to park 
at an odd angle to the pump): if toward the end of refuelling I slowed down 
the gas flow (to the first notch on automatic ones) and also turned the nozzle 
sideways as much as possible, there was no spillage! I've done it this 
way a few times now, and so far it's worked well.The position is a little 
awkward, but beats having smelly shoes.
