Subject: '78 Westy SHOULD I BUY IT?????

&gt; Subject: '78 Westy SHOULD I BUY IT?????

&gt; from: a Newbie
&gt; I have been carrying this in my pocket for 3 days and
&gt; dreaming

Stop dreaming and call.  Nothing to lose by looking, poking
and proding.  Look at the bus, then you can give us more
details.

&gt; Ad as follows:VW WESTFALIA '78: 2000cc, propane stove,
&gt; pop-top, sleeps 4, sink, new tires, new battery, new
&gt; brakes,runs great, pullout am/fm cass.  excl cond., $3900.

&gt; I have been lurking on the list for a few days. My teenager
&gt; totalled my 1987 toyota van I had for 9 years and me and the
&gt; kids are currently riding the bus. I could handle all the
&gt; basic repairs and maintenance on my old van.

Sorry to hear about the wheels, hope the teenager is OK.  If
you're brave enough to deal with the '87 Toyota, you should
be in good shape for a '78 VW.

&gt; But as a recent single parent now w/kids will this be a good
&gt; investment or I guess what I really need vs. want is a car
&gt; big enough for 5 people and a VW van for the beach and
&gt; weekends.

The &quot;big enough for 5 people&quot; is easy, but what goes on at
the beach and on weekends?  Are you looking at Westy because
you want to camp on weekends?  If you don't plan, have
enough money, have enough time, to do mucho camping the
Westy may be overkill.  If the Westy is a cherry, and the
price is right, it will serve your weekday needs and your
weekend needs.

&gt; With a factory manual would I be able to take care of
&gt; repairs without too much expense. My brother is a german car
&gt; specialist, lives 3 hrs away but at least parts are
&gt; available at a discount.

Always helps to have some connections and it would be wise
to have your brother look at the vehicle to counter the
emotional &quot;I want it, I want it&quot; that most prospective VW
buyers suffer.

&gt; Yes, I asked him but he says it is my van; my decision

Yeh, your decision, but he can help it be an informed
decision, can't he?

&gt; Depending on mileage what is a fair counter offer range for
&gt; a '78?

&gt; Patty

You've come to the right place....this list.  I have more
experience with splitties than bay-windows so I'm no expert
on pricing a '78.  I will check my &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot;
for some ball-park values while I'm home at lunch.  Weakly
stats show 15 people on-list with '78s, any points of
comparison out there, folks?
