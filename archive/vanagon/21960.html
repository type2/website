                      RE&gt;&gt;Rust removal and corrosion. (Long)       8/2/95

A &quot;Dremel&quot; modeler's tool works wonders here, although you may never associate
that with mufflers etc. but it works like this:

One of the attachments for the Dremel is a 1&quot; dia. cut off wheel.  They are
replaceable disks about 1/16&quot; thick or less that go on an arbor that chucks
into the Dremel spindel.  It will cut through anything I can think of.  Steel
is it's speciality, maybe not so well on aluminum,  or brass but probably. 
Anyway, it reaches into tight corners, and all you have to do si let the
abrasive cut through at it's own rate.  I have used it on muffler bolts/nuts,
as well as the retaining nut on a sink faucet where a basin wrench proved
totally useless!  A lot easier than the hacksaw blade and probably takes about
the same amount of time or maybe even less. Be sure to wear eye protection, it
does generate a shower of grit and sparks.
