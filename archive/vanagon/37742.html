&gt;got come quotes on tires today, and OUCH they're expensive.
&gt;
&gt;_at_ Goodyear:
&gt;
&gt;   1.  205/70 - 15 Aquatred II's  115.99 each, set of 4 with all the 
&gt;                extras $601.04.
&gt;   2.  195/70 - 15 OEM's 133.80, or $684.50 for the entire deal.
&gt;
&gt;Isn't that more than most of the people on the list paid for their 
&gt;entire busses?  :)
&gt;
&gt;Personally, I think this guy is out of his mind.  Has anybody else priced 
&gt;these things?
&gt;
&gt;Also has anybody put 205's on their Eurovan?  Did they fit ok?
&gt;
&gt;Also checked at a local discounter for the Pirelli Aquamile's.
&gt;
&gt;205/70 - 15's $79.95 each, 80,000 mile warranty, 454.11 for the entire 
&gt;set including lifetime balance and roadhazard.
&gt;
&gt;If I can't find Goodyears cheaper, I'm gonna try the pirelli's.
&gt;
&gt;

Try Sumitomos. Sumitomo is a well established racing and passenger car tire
company in (gulp) Japan.  I usually don't buy Japanese stuff because of their
protectionist government policies, but these are such an excellent value, I
can't pass them up.  I sell tires at my shop, and I have had excellent
results from them.  For Type 2s, they come in 2 flavors.  The 8-ply
recommended light truck tire (your van is a one-ton truck), and the HTR 70.
 The HTR 70 is a fine passenger car tire.  The H speed rating doesn't just
relate to speed, It also says something about the stability and
responsiveness of a tire.  Treadwear rating is 320, traction is rated A,
temperature is rated A.  I love these.  They are very affordable.  I sell
 them to my customers for about $400.00 for a set of 4  mounted, balanced,
new stems, South Carolina tire import duty, and sales tax.
