Subject: Winnebago EV?

Today on my way home from work I saw a white Eurovan camper with a 
reasonably low-profile pop-top and an extended wheelbase.  There 
weren't any side windows towards the far back of the vehicle, but that 
was about as much info as I could gather before it turned onto the 
highway.  Now I've seen the EV Westfalia Weekender as well as the 
Winnie Rialta.  Was this another Winnie or a possibly a new Westie?!?!  
Inquiring minds (of a normally air-cooled persuasion) would like to 
know......
