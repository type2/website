Subject:       the Drip vs. full blowout

am i correct in thinking there are 2 types of head gasket failures in 
the wasserboxer?  

the first and possibly most common being the 
failure of the big seal for the cooling jacket to the engine case-- 
leading to the obnoxious drip.

secondly, a full head gasket failure with combustion gases being 
forced into the cooling system.

the former being annoying but not too serious if coolant levels are 
maintained and the latter being a wallet-deflating emergency, right?
