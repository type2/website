&gt; I guess I should have said insane _camper_ prices.
&gt; 
&gt; Just out of curiousity, what do you camper owners use the pop-top 
&gt; for?  Added headroom, or do you actually sleep up there as well?
&gt; I can't imagine leaving the top up when it's 10 below.  Do you just
&gt; have it open when cooking, etc, and then close it (in the cold months)
&gt; when it's time sleep?

Well, I don't do much cold camping, but when we do go camping, we pop
the top for headroom and to air out the camper better.  There are
2 sleeping arrangements for us.  We can either sleep up top with
the junk down below or we can put the junk up top and sleep down
below.  

In the more frigid climates, I would definately get some kind of
heater.  Preferably vented to the outside.

&gt; Would adding some westy-type equipment be a waste without the added
&gt; headroom the poptop gives?

This would be too much work for me.  I'd just sell the no-topper and
get one with a pop-top.
