        No! do not agree to a search, even if they do have a warrant.  Be
polite and offer to unlock any locked compartments, but be sure to say that
you are not giving legal consent.

        In the police academy(in calif. at least) they make a point of
stressing that you ask for permission even with a warrant.  The reason is
that if the warrant isn't good (and it probably wont be) you (the officer)
still have the poor sap's verbal consent, thus you have a good search, even
with a bad (won't stand up in court) warrant. (to answer the obvious
question, I lost faith)

        Once when a cop pointed out that he could get a warrant I reminded
him that refusal to agree to a search does not constitute probable cause.
That got some dirt kicked in my face (I was lying on the ground at the time)
but they didn't search my vehicle and they let me go after a while (apx. 40
min)of lying on the frozen ground in a pair of shorts and a T-shirt.
