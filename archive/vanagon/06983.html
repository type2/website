Subject: Re: need  advice about a  bus...

Well, yeah, now that you mention it I _do_ think you
were totally crazy to get involved in this, but since you
did, and since it is (I believe) a Mortal Sin to ignore
your VW, I'd go ahead and trust this shop to take care of
the Bus whilst not taking you for a ride.  (Do you have at
least one or two references regarding the honesty and/or
quality of the mechanics?)   Unless you're willing to fly
out to Washington now to be around when they evaluate it, it
doesn't appear that you have many choices.

You know, of course, that ONLY a Bus-lover would do something
like this.  God love us all, we're insane but fun.
