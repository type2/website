Subject: 1987 Double sliding door?

I just made a trip to the local library with the wife and kids and as I was
going through it I noticed the Consumers Guide's automobile reviews.  I
picked up the 1987 edition to see what it had to say about the Syncro.   This
is what it said in part:

WHAT'S NEW FOR '87

Volkswagen's line of com[act vans, which gained 4-wheel-drive models last
year, get one major change this year.  Vanagon GL models will gain a second
sliding door, this one on the driver's side of the vehicle.  This is the
first van sold in the U.S. with that feature.......

Has anyone ever seen an '87 or any other year of Vanagon with this?  I never
have.  If this did make to these shores, it makes me wonder why Chrysler is
making such a big deal about their double sliding door vans for '96 when VW
had it 9 years before on the Vanagon.  But what else can you expect from the
company that claims they invented the mini-van?
