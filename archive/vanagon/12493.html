Wow!!!  I like what you did the idea.  Though I had originally
thought that 
NETSURFEGNUGEN was a bit better since you can say it faster and with 
a better flow.  But hey, I just write here you know . . .

Anyway, I do like the idea of keeping the address on the bottom--don't
abbreviate.

And about Wolf's idea of the &quot;everyone's own sticker&quot; . . . I've already
got 100 of them, who is to tell which belongs to the list . . .
Besides, I still have some space left on the back window . . .
