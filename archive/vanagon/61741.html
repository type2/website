Woody,

&gt;         The rubber gasket on the poptop of my '84 Westy has started to
&gt; droop...... I'm trying to decide whether I should: 1) try to glue the offending
&gt; area back up with the thought that the rest of it will remain intact; or 2)
&gt; punt and buy a replacement now.

If it's drooping then it's _quite_ likely that the metal strip inside 
the rubber is shot with rust so just gluing the drooping portion 
isn't going to cure it - just create a rusty mess and allow the rest 
to eventually go the same way.  Best replace it or, if you're after a 
very low cost solution remove it entirely, thoroughly remove the 
remains of the metal strip and glue back on with a good contact 
adhesive.  The dealer price for the strip is IMHO outrageous - go for 
an aftermarket one.  Archives should point to sources.
