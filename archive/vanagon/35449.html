Subject: ccc's 2/23-25 location vote


Thanks Dave, for making that informative post about your two suggested
places for our camping trip next weekend.  I liked both, rather preferring
the remoteness you described in the Long Valley site.  

HOWEVER, if it turns out that you will not be able to accompany us, I'd
vote for saving Long Valley for a time when you do, and choosing
Peppermint instead.  One other vote has come in in the same direction.

How about the rest of you?  I'm not too keen on offroading 20 miles
up steep roads into &quot;nowhere&quot; unless Schwarze is there to lead us to
this uncharted area.  Has someone else out there ever been to this
place?

Comments?  Opinions?  Votes?

Time is drawing near; I think we should decide..

--

food:  I originally had in mind to suggest doing German food, but
Linda Johnson tell me Steve started making faces (pickled figs to
you, buster!  :), so am revising this at Bradley's suggestion, to
be:  &quot;international&quot; cuisine.  Howzzat?
