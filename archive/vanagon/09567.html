&gt; 
&gt;  As it seems that all the fun is on the west coast, perhaps we
&gt; easterners should take some sort of action. Anyone interested 
&gt; in trying to come up with something over here?
&gt; Any suggestions? (I know of some great spots in North Carolina !!!)
&gt; Hopeful,
&gt;   Richard
&gt; 

I'm all for it (and in Atlanta).  How about Highlands, Smokies or 
Asheville areas  (about 3 hours from here--I think the bus will make it 
that far).
