AAARRGH!!!!!

I got my engine case back from the machine shop today BUT the boneheads
bead blasted it. Needless to say I was pissed. Bead blasting engine
cases is a definite NO-NO. I guess I'll spend the rest of the weekend
trying to clean out all of the grit. If that wasn't enough to top off my
day, My engine parts arrived WITHOUT the camshaft I ordered and was
billed for. I was planning on spending the long weekend building my
engine so I could finally get my Vanagon on the road. I guess I'l just
have to wait another week.  Any words of encouragement would be
appreciated.
