Road Test No. 119:  VW Micro Bus
Road &amp; Track, December 1956

Road testing a commercial vehicle may seem more than a little out of
R&amp;T's normal province, but the popularity of Volkswagen's compact,
utilitarian four-wheelers has risen in this country to a point where
we felt an accurate record of their performance abilities would make
an interesting report.  Also, we have had many requests from our readers
who are curious as to the advantages and disadvantages of such a machine
as a replacement for a domestic station wagon.  Then too, our personal
interest in the absolute performance was whetted by the fact that we had
purchased a competitive vehicle, primarily on the basis that we were
getting more performance.  Did we make a wise choice, and if so, what
did we get for the extra $500?

Comparisons can best be made by a quick summary according to the
following compilation:
List price (VW Camper)            $3150
Top speed 2-way avg.              59.0 mph
Acceleration, 0 to 50 mph         30.6 secs.
Acceleration, SS 1/4 mile         27.0 secs.
Mileage range                     26/29 mpg.

&gt;From this it is easy to see that the VW, in any of various commercial
forms, is no fury on wheels.  On the other hand it gives reasonable and
sensible performance with remarkable economy and utility.  Consider, for
example, the timed top speed.  The most favorable run gave a dead 60.0
actual mph, with the speedometer indicating 62.5.  Any Kombi, Micro Bus,
or Camper owner will tell you this figure is absurd ... he has indicated
70 mph on a dead level highway for hours at a time.  Like the Volkswagen
sedan, the larger &quot;bus&quot; is extremely sensitive to almost impreceptible
assists by wind and gradient.  Our tests are fair, impartial, and
accurate, and in this case the odometer reads 6900 miles.  Tappley
readings indicate a good state of tune, and the vehicle felt very brisk
even though the figures are not impressive in this modern age of 300
cubic inch production hot-rods.

Like the passenger cars, the VW commercial vehicles have rev limit
markings on the speedometer dial: I = 10 mph, II = 20 mph, III = 34 mph,
and IV = 48 mph.  The factory provides a warning sign in front of the
driver which reads, &quot;The allowable top speed of this vehicle is 50 miles
per hour.&quot;  No one pays much attention to this, or for that matter, the
rev limit marks.  Factory recommendations correspond to 2860 rpm in 1st,
3000 rpm in 2nd, 3320 rpm in 3rd, and 3270 rpm in 4th.  The willing
little engine readily exceeds these figures as shown in our data panel
and acceleration curve.  We used a nominal limit of 4000 rpm during the
tests; above that rate the fan protests with a fairly pronounced shriek.
The engine is located at the rear, and there is a certain amount of
rumble and noise from it, as well as gear whine.  Some of these decibils
are undoubtedly due to the higher (than the VW sedan) number of engine
revolutions required per mile, while possibly the straight-cut 21/15
reduction gears used at each driving wheel may also be responsible.
In any event, we did not find the noises too objectionable, even in 200
miles of continuous driving.  However, we do recommend that anyone
contemplating purchase of the Micro Bus as a long-distance travel wagon
should drive it and make their own evaluation.

Up in the front seat, which seats 3 comfortably, the ride is certainly
on the choppy side, and tricky dips must be anticipated to avoid lumps
on the head.  Passengers riding between the wheels fare somewhat better,
though the seat cushions are quite firm.

The Micro Bus is very easy to drive, has wonderful visibility and easy
steering requiring only 3.5 turns lock to lock for a 39 ft. turning
circle.  The straight-down pedals are a little awkward for an average
foot, but the long gear lever gives typical VW shifts, and the nearly
vertical steering wheel provides perfect control with a minimum of
fatigue (as on our Greyhound buses).

Volkswagen offers 3 bus models, the blue Kombi at $2195, the green
Micro Bus (as tested) at $2365, and the deluxe Micro Bus finished in
red and black at slightly more.  The middle-priced machine is a very
good buy with well finished interiors and good detail work.  All three
have the unique double-door on the right hand side, and the center and
rear seat assemblies can be removed in two minutes.  This opens up
170 cu. ft. of space for storage or what-have-you.  The deluxe Micro Bus
has extra curved glass panels along the roof and rear quarters, plus a
sliding cloth sunshine roof.   The Camper has the interior fitted out
with 2 bunks, a table and storage cabinets.  Floor to roof height is
however, only 53.15&quot; and no stove or refrigerator are provided.

As a handy-wagon, any one of these models makes a sensible and
economical work-horse, perfectly satisfactory for those who can still
shift gears and will be satisfied with a maximum cruising speed of
60 mph.
