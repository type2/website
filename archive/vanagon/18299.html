Hey TED,  Those little jobbers are hard to find.  I broke a couple of them
and had to salvage some out of a junker.  Kinda hard to get them in there 
too;  have to pry open the end of the bar. Just  be sure you get them while 
you can.  Do Vanagons have those curtain rod doo-dads?

P.S.  Did you find out how to post?  You should have a 'compose message'
option in your mail facility.  (Send it to VANAGON_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu)
