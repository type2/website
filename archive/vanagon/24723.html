Subject: Re: Tragic yet comforting bus news


&gt;he, his wife, and her parents were driving down the
&gt;highway, when their super-friendly huge rottweiler climbed into the
&gt;passenger seat. The dog knocked the van into reverse, which locked up
&gt;the rear end completely, and rolled the bus 3 times.
&gt;  Thank God, no one was hurt at all. He was the only one wearing a seat
&gt;belt even. Luckily as well, no other vehicles were involved.
&gt;So, on the bright side, score another super-safety point for vanagons...
&gt;:(
&gt;And of course the other moral is-don't drive an automatic!


Ah, not quite. The moral is: Don't let your Rottweiler drive an automatic!

Did he have a license?   :)

And, how could a dog smart enough to put on a seat belt, be dumb
enough to mis-shift the transmission?

Good news about lack of injuries, tho...
