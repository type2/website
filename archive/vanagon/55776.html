Subject: Interesting EV Demographic


As I was thumbing through my new copy of the Brooklands Volkswagen Military 
Portfolio and reminissing about my old 1974 Thing, something suddenly dawned 
on me.....isn't it interesting that there are at least three EV owners on 
the list who have TWICE, under no duress, etc., purchased two of VW's 
marketing masterpieces....the VW Thing and the EuroVan.

Let's see....I'm guilty....so are Pete Sellers and the Killians....are there 
others? What other bizzare behavior do we have in common? Hmmmmmm.......

Ric...or should I say....&quot;I'm Ric....and I'm a Thing-and-EuroVan-aholic&quot;
