Subject: re: Uh-Oh!  Tranny or Shift Linkage?

This kind of sounds like my problem. I'm the originator of the 'Arg, my 
transmission went kaput' thread. Sounds like my syncros are bad (thanks 
for all the advice, gang). I dropped the transmission last Sunday but wont 
know about the syncros until I break it open over the long weekend. I'll 
keep everyone posted.
