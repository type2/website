&gt; 2) The PCV system will blow oil into your air filter, which will
&gt;   then get sucked into the air intake system for combustion. It
&gt;    is posible that this oil will then burn in the cylinder, 
&gt;   causing uncontrollable engine RPM. You can't turn it off because
&gt;   there are no sparkplugs, and it ain't coming from the injectors, so
&gt;   removing your foot from the accelrator won't help.
Matthew, do I have a pcv valve on this thing?  I haven't been able to locate
it at all (I have an 82 diesel like you do).
I am considering construction of an oil collection system over the oil
filler tube.  Any experience there?
Stuart
