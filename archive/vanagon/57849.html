Subject: Synthetic oil and older type two motor seals

When a person uses synthetic motor oil  in an older type 2 air cooled
engine, ('78), will the motors engine seals be attacked or ruined by the
synthetic oil.  I need some chatter on this before I switch over.  I
noticed a vast improvement in my motorcycle when I made the switch and
wondered primarily if the new oil would harm the old seals within the
motor.  Since the engine relys on the oil as a factor of cooling, the
higher heat range of the synthetic oil without viscosity breakdown
suggests a better way to go.  It is just the paranoia of unrelated parts
within the mix.

     Thanks in advance
