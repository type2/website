Subject: CV Joints

Hi there,

I'm interested in replacing my outer cv joints on my 84 VW CAMPER.
I crawled under the van and, although it seems obvious how to remove 
the inner cv's, the outer ones seem to be a bit of a mystery as they are 
within the suspension housing.  Do I have to remove that large nut on 
the axel, or do I need some sort of extended tool to reach the 6 nuts
concealed by the house, or do I have to dismantle the brakes and the 
whole housing?  Please email me at gressman_at_giftcraft_dot_com.
Thanks,

Any and all advice is appreciated...

Jim
