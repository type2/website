Subject: Tables, Oil Leaks, and Aux. Heater in 79 Campmobile

Hi,
   I just got a 79 Westfalia Campmobile and it comes with two tables.  There
is a spot to put one of the tables on the dashboard, but I cannot figure out
where to put the other table (in the back?)  There is absolutely nowhere to
connect it to.  I am missing something? Does anybody have any suggestions
for modifications that I would be able to make?

   My van also leaks oil :-( I hate to see the puddle on the ground, but I
have been told that it is common to most VW's.  It is coming from the oil
filter bracket where it connects to the engine. I tried to take this bracket
off, but cannot get at the bolts which hold it in?  Any suggestions?  Also
could it be coming from the oil cooler?  Could I fix that without pulling
the engine? FYI it seems to be leaking about a 1/2L (1 pint?) every 500km
(380mi).  Does it need to  be fixed??

And last, but not least, i have a auxillary heater.  More often than not, it
works, but sometimes it doesn't.  I have heard that these are walking time
bombs.  Are they safe, or should I turn it on and run?  

Thanks in advance for your help, as this is my first time letter; the van is
3 weeks old to me?  


PS.  It is an automatic and the reverse lights don't work (bulb and fuse ok)
any advice.  I thought I should kill four birds with one stone and save paper.
