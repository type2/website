&gt; Summary - To lengthen the life of a CV, one needs to switch sides of
&gt; the transmission.

Hi Jeff and all: I think the CVs should be taken off and switched from
side to side, but the drive axle should remain on the original side.
These are torsional axles and are designed to twist a bit to take up
some shock loads. If you take the axles and switch sides they will have
to start twisting in the opposite direction they have been broken in to
twist. It is like torsion bars. You are not supposed to switch torsion
bars or they might fail.   Todd Francis
