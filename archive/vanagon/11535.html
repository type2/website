Well hot damn!  You mean you're ready to start tearing up the highways and
getting strange looks from people driving Acuras (Like I do)??  OK, so you
don't exactly tear up the highways in a VW Bus.  Anyway, good work.

I drove the camper to a job interview one time, and I don't know if anybody
saw me rattle up in the thing or not, but I was offered the job (turned 'em
down...)
Depending on the type of place you're interviewing they may view your
choice of vehicle as expressing a bohemian individualism, or they may
suspect you of being a pot-smoking, fuzzy thinking, anarchist, like the
rest of us Bus nuts  :)  Seriously, I kinda doubt anybody would care what
you drive, at least, not in Iowa.  I think Californians take what you drive
a little more seriously.

Friday I'm going to be in the vicinity of Van Allen Hall--someplace around
there you want to meet?  (The only place I can think of is Bruegger's Bagel
Bakery...)
Time?  I don't think I'll be available much before 3:00.  Well, maybe 2:30.

Anyway, I may have heat again by then.  Ark Mirvis in New Jersey is
supposed to ship out the heater priority tomorrow.  Hope.

Later,

Mike
