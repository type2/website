Subject:      Chris, can we number the messages?

Several list members inquired if we can receive the same format for the
Digest mail as we did with the old list.  Each posting used to have a
corresponding number with the numbers from the table of contents, making
finding a specific message very easy, without having to go through all th=
e
messages.  =


So far I haven't seen any response to anyone's postings that inquired abo=
ut
this.  Is this possible to accomplish?  It would be soooo nice to have th=
is
feature again.

Thanks,

Sorin Bejenaru
