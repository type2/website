Subject: Re: vanagon oil warning system

This warning system (although hearing it referred to as a &quot;cold&quot; warning 
system is news to me) is the same as on my '85 VW Jetta.  I had problems 
with the system after of all things, washing the engine.  Apparently I 
was not allowing the engine to cool down enough before rinsing the 
engine cleaner off and the cold water was frying the oil pressure switch 
that was mounted on the oil filter flange (Jetta, remember).

After wasing the engine, and tooling down the road, the buzzer would go 
off and, looking in the engine compartment, I'd find a steady stream of 
oil running from the oil pressure switch.

Anyway, this system does not seem to have so much to do with cold oil as 
it measures an unusual difference of pressure between two oil pressure 
switches.  In the Jetta, it measured the difference between the switch 
at the oil filter and the switch on the cylinder head.  The system only 
activates itself above a certain RPM (2,000 to the best of my 
recollection).

It was also my understanding that in the earlier model years, the 
circuit boards that are mounted behind the speedometer were rather 
buggy.  I ended up replacing one of them after it decided to start going 
off for no reason and it never gave me another problem.

On my 92 Passat, occasionally this system will sound for a split second 
when starting the car, I don't know whether this is an occasional test 
or a bug in the system--it's never gone off when I've been driving the 
car.

The are diagnostics in the Bentley manual for the Jetta and the Passat, 
and I think in the Vanagon manual, I haven't read that far yet, but I 
think I saw the subject headline in the contents list. --
