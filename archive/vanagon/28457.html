Subject:       adjusting torsion bars

I found a bubble protractor for $8 at my local lumberyard.  I'm not 
sure what VW charges for the tool (you use it to adjust the torsion 
bars on the rear suspension), but I'll betcha its not eight smackers. 
If you're rear end is sagging (your buss's rear end, that is), an 
dyou want more info on the tool (like what to ask for at the 
counter), let me know and I'll look in the toolbox.  I think the 
manufacturer actually calls it a degree meter or some such, and it's 
intended to measure roof pitches and stuff.
