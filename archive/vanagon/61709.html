Subject: Transmission In! Thanks 83 Westy.

Thanks to all who helped with advice and information on swapping the 4-speed
transmission in my newly purchased (but not yet camped in) 83 Westfalia. Now
that I've changed the wicked noisy transmission for a rebuild I can hear the
exhaust leak much better. The PO had a rebuilt engine &quot;installed&quot; if you can
call it that by a.... well let's just leave it at that.

It looks as if the &quot;mechanic&quot; stripped the head bolt hole for the exhaust
manifold on cyl. #4. He only installed one bolt instead of two. I assume
because the second hole on the manifold was off by about 1 mm. (I mean c'mon.
Put in the extra #_at_%%!!! 20 minutes! Thanks for letting the heater core hose
ride on the rear axle as well!)

So now I'll attack that problem. (The exhaust not the &quot;mechanic&quot;)
Unfortunately that exhaust leak exhausted my chances of going to the
Litchfiled Bug Inn. (OK I'll Bug Inn next year in a series of next years.) 

Then on to solve the rough idle. (What I wouldn't give to look in the engine
bay and see a Solex 30 PICT needing a rebuild.) 

I'm hoping to get this Vanagon mobile in the next few weeks. And I appreciate
the support from you all. It is the one thing that makes me believe these
Westys actually can get me from one place to another and camp when I get
there. The PO insisted everything was working and top notch. I figured, &quot;Not
exactly BUT I'll put a bearing in the trans and clean the plugs and be on my
way. That was $$$$ and a few months ago. (On a posative note the dealer
wanted more $$$$$ than imaginable. And I am getting an intimate knowledge of
my Magic Bus, which my friends have affectionately dubbed The Tragic Bus.)

But with your support I'm convinced (sort of) that she (an I) will ride. As
far as my support, I'm putting a check in the mail today.

When I do get moving, rest assured I won't be burning any plastic.

Thanks again,
Jeff
