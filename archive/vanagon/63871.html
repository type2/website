Subject: Parts delivery to NE from Bus Depot

Just wanted to give one last chance to those who want to get parts 
from Ron up to New England.  We're delivering some mirrors to Cape 
Cod and will be staying at listmember Wendy Silva's Sunday the 24th.  

Now that UPS is down, this may be more of interest than when I 
originally posted it.  So if anyone needs anything delivered 
(reasonably sized please), please figure out the financials with Ron 
and we can make arrangements to meet.  No charge for listmembers, of 
course...just giving back to the list.

Our route will be from Allentown, PA up to the Boston area on the 
night of the 21st (BTW, does anyone know any good truck stops, etc. 
where we can crash and get a hot shower on the way to Boston?), up to 
Saco, Maine on the 23rd, and down to Falmouth, Mass. on the 24th.  

P-mail me or call me at home: 610-366-1420, leave a message if 
interested.  

I'm picking up a load of parts from Ron on th 19th at noon.

Regards,

-Karl
