Subject: Henry Manney III


As a few of you have mentioned Henry Manney III and lamented his
passing you may want to pick up a copy of his anthology published
by Brooklands Books, and available from Classic Motorbooks. Lots of
good stuff there!

In a bit of irony, Henry wrote his last R&amp;T road test on the
1979 VW Bug Convertible....how ironic that this article marked
the passing of two &quot;greats&quot;!
