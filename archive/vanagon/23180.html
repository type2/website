Subject: bike rack info

I think somebody already mentioned some of these racks but here goes anyway.

In the Colorado Cyclist Catalog Late Summer 1995 edition I came across 
many racks.
1 800 688 8600


Wyers StealthRak  $69.99
Frame rests only on the bumper.  Looks like it could be used for bus 
front or rear.  Holds up to three bikes.  This seems like the best 
designed unit for bus applications.

Hollywood Rack  F-1 Carrier  $39.99
Mounts like you would think for a sedan.  Pads rest on trunk and bumper 
but also fits up against flat surface like the back of a bus.  Holds 
three bikes.  Two straps connect to lip of trunk by rear window and two 
to the underside of car.  I have used this on the rear of my bus and it 
works.  Takes some time before you feel comfortable as it seems as 
though there's a lot of weight on the two top straps on upper rain 
gutter.  But it lasted from San Diego to Santa Fe, New Mexico and back. 
 Bungies help.  For thirty more $$  I would have picked StealthRak if I 
hadn't borrowed this unit for free.

Hollywood Rack  F-5 Deluxe Carrier  $59.99
Same as F-1 but with molded notches (cradles) for bike placement.

Hollywood Rack  SR-1 Spare Tire Rack  $74.99
This would work for front of busses with spare tire.   Holds two bikes 
and adjusts laterally to center on wheel.

There are hitch racks as well.  These run from $129.99 to $199.99 and 
come in two, three or four bike capacity.

Hope this helps.

Doug
