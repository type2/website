This is gREAT news!  I've been cogitating about adding the hitch to the EV
myself, though I'd probably stick with the under-4K pounds recommended in
the manual.  That should be plenty for most of the stuff I'm likely to do.
I'm fixin' to move in the next few months, so this option is a great one.
I will probably be putting my old 60 singlecab back on pavement for hauling
the dirty, heavy stuff, like the lathe and drill press, though.  I don't
have to worry about getting it dirty, it might even wind up cleaner than
the stuff I haul! (you should see it!).
