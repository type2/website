Subject: Rpt: Trip, KC to St. Louis

Hi All,

The trip from KC to St. Louis was smmooth sailing.  21 mpg!!  The engine
was still breaking in.  Above 65 it seemed a bit hestitant, but after 100
miles or so it was smooth up to 75mpg (for passing purposes).  The new
owner was pleased with it, but I made the mistake of parking on a steep
incline at the motel parking lot.  The coolant temp warning light went
bezerk after I restarted and would not stop blinking even though all was
cool and functioning.  After I was dropped off at the airport for my
return to KC, the dang thing still was blinking.  Hopefully it reset
itself for the new owner's trip back to Kentucky.

My new project is starting off with the purchase of an 89 VW Fox donor car
for an upright 1.8 four cylinder transplant onto a VW Bus transaxle.  More
on that as it happens.  8-)
