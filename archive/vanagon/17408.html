Subject: FOR SALE Bus goodies, 1600 d.p., s.p. stuff

Howdy all!

Just made an inventory of the stuff I've got out in the garage and need to
unload.  I've put year ranges where applicable (culled from Bus Stop
catalog).  Prices, as usual, are negotiable, and do not include shipping
from Cleveland.  Here's the list:

1600 dual port, bus engine, running and complete, minus one heater box and
muffler.  Email for more details.  $350

Bus tranny, from a '71 (same one as engine), good condition, doesn't pop
out of any gear.  $100

**Package Deal!**  Take both of the above for $400!

Passenger seat from '77, brown upholstry, good condition.  $25

2 bus wheels w/tires, one good (Michelin), $25, one no tread, $10

**The above items cannot be shipped (easily) so you'd have to pick them up
at my place in Cleveland.  I am planning on being at the Auburn Hills,
Michigan VVWCA show on May 21, so delivery can be arranged if you will be
there.**
