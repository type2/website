Subject: re: Moose  -Reply

&gt;
&gt;one time is was driving north in my Honda CRX (cruis'n speed ~ 140kph),
&gt;and i came around one corner in the middle of the night and there where
&gt;5-6 of them in the middle of the road, licking salt - i had the
&gt;wheels locked, everyone screaming, just missed them...
&gt;then, after i got my hands pryed off of the steering wheel, i thought, 
&gt;gee, if i didn't slow down, i would take out them spindly legs and be far 
&gt;beyond the mass of the moose before it hit the ground, hitting them as 
&gt;slow speed in my CRX would result in the mass of the moose flopping 
&gt;on my head!!!
&gt;didn't have a chance to test my theory.


A friend of mine did have the chance to test this theory--in a '67 bug. 
She took out the legs and it floped down on the roof with remarkably little
damage.

Every year at the beginning of moose hitting season the local paper runs
their &quot;Give a moose a brake&quot; ad.  It is a picture of a chevyish van with a
moose laying across the front seats and all four legs sticking out the
front window.  
Not a survivable accicent.
