&gt;Regarding 'A' (which has had no major work done on it), what can i expect
to go wrong &amp; how soon &amp; how much $$?  I'd guess an engine within
40K miles (?) tranny at 200k (?)....?  How long does the
viscous synro coupling last?  What else is probably needing work judging
by the miles (i'll take it into a mechanic for a look-see when/if i get
serious about buying it).  Are how much more costly to maintain or
tempermental are these here syncros?  Are they worth it?


Stephen,
     I have owned my '86 for 6 years, and have had no trouble with the
syncro specific parts.  I have had problems that all Vanagons share.  I have
192,500 miles on my van, and have had no problems with the fluid coupling.
Syncros are a little more of an effort to maintain, because of the all wheel
drive.  You have 8 CV's to care for and you have to keep the same tires at
all for corners.  Tire pressures are also important, they must be maintained
at the factory specks.  Any thing that changes relative tire diameter can
effect the fluid coupling.  They syncro specific parts are more expensive
but seam to last longer.
     I feel the added benefits of the all wheel drive more than make up for
the added maintainace costs.  I use my regularly as a farm vehicle.  I use
it to put up fences, haul hay, ( 8 bails at a time),  and many other uses
out in the pastures.  I only got stuck once, I had BF GoodRich TA radials on
it.  I now run Bridgestone dualers.
     I would recommend a syncro to anyone that runs in bad weather or drives
off road in moderatly rough terrain.  The syncro would do well in rough
terrain with the addition of added bash plates and rerouting of the exhaust
and cooling lines.

Can you tell I realy like my Syncro!!

Cheers to all the listee's
