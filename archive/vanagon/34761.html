I see...late model vanagon owners could have rectangular streamers, bay
window owners' streamers could be slightly curved, and splitty owners could,
of course, have split streamers. If you own multiple types, you'll get
multiple streamers. 

Wonder what longer flagstaffs could signify?  &lt;--ooo, step back Joe! this
