&gt; &gt; I see that the Bosch is mentioned alot and was wondering what its smog
&gt; &gt; story is for CA.
&gt; 
&gt; Illegal for any VW in which it was not original equipment.  Most VW's that
&gt; I know of have at least one diaphragm on the distributor (mine has two)
&gt; and they are required to pass emissions.  The 009 is all mechanical advance
&gt; and has no diaphragms.

Hmm, at every smog check I get they do the visual and all that seems to 
be required for me is PCV hose.  I've had the 009 on my bus for 2 
inspections so far.
