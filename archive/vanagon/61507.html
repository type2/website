I just had my heads off to replace leaky gaskets on my 2.1. I used info in my
Bently manual as well as the files archive at:

http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/Files/

then look under HOW-TO--- Head-Gasket-Replacement.  You probably could  just
replace the valves on one side of the engine and get the compression back to
specs.  Chances are that once you get the head off you will find corrosion on
it around the gasket area for this reason you may want to replace the entire
head with a new one but as I found out the corrosion can be repaired quite
easily. For info on this look in the files archive under
HOW-TO-Head-Repair-With-J-B-Weld.  I used this procedure on my heads.  I just
took it on a 3000 mile trip from Michigan to Florida and back and I am happy
to report that this repair has held up wonderfully and saved me a small
fortune.  I hope this helps.                        Chris
