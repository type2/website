 &gt; The last time I looked Bentleys were going for between $150,000 and $200,000
 &gt; being the cheaper version of the Rolls-Royce.

I'm sorry, this isn't related to Vanagons but since I also own a Bentley 
motorcar I couldn't let the slur pass.

Bentleys are in no wise &quot;cheaper&quot; versions of Rolls Royces.  They are the 
&quot;performance&quot; or &quot;sporting&quot; versions.  Consider the Turbo R or the new Azure 
convertible ($319,000, btw).
They are trimmed to just as high level as the more sedate, pedestrian Rollers, 
and go faster too.

Mine?  I have a '51 Mark VI sedan.  You can get pretty nice Mark VI and the 
follow on R-types for under $20,000 (about the price of a Westy Syncro, nu?  
(had to get some VW relevance in or I'd be
summarily unsubscribed))

Sorry for the digression, but I felt compelled to &quot;rectify&quot; things.
