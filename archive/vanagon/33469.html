&gt;RAPE MY WOMAN?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
&gt;Get over it, your car is just a piece of metal.... but what you have said 
&gt;here is that you would rather have a violent crime committed against 
&gt;&quot;your&quot; woman than to lose a piece of automotive equipment.  How could any 
&gt;rational person advocate such a thing.  I was feeling sorry for you at 
&gt;the beginning of this your post, now I only feel sorry for any unlucky 
&gt;woman who happens to become &quot;yours&quot;  If you really understood the effects 
&gt;of rape on the survivors of this vicious crime I doubt that you would be 
&gt;making light of it or using it to show just how much you love your car.

I should've said &quot;STEAL my woman,&quot; or something like that.  I overstated the
case in my rush to post.  Sorry!

And yes, one can say &quot;my&quot; woman, like one says &quot;my&quot; father or &quot;my&quot; mother. .
.indicating relationship not (necessarily) possession.  Or at least implying
voluntary possession.
