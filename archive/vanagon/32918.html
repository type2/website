So Martha says:
&gt; 
&gt; The meals seem to come in a variety of flavors; I chose chili for no particular
&gt; reason.  Mind you, I wasn't into eating the thing, but VERY curious as to
&gt; how the self-contained heater/stove would work.  Anyway, I still haven't
&gt; eaten it, and may never, for the same reason.  Here's how it works:
&gt; 
&gt; Inside the box, there's a food heater made of salt, iron, and magnesium.
&gt; When water is added, it becomes salt water.  This causes the iron and
&gt; magnesium to produce heat....and heat the meal.  Basically, you open the
&gt; included water pouch, pour the water on the food heater (which looks
&gt; like a bag of iron filings).  You repackage the food and it's surroundings,
&gt; put it back into the carton, and close the tab for 14 minutes, and
&gt; viola - a hot meal!
&gt; 
&gt; Now it struck me that the would be not only a good way to be able to heat
&gt; food while camping if one runs out of fire/propane/etc., but might also
&gt; be a viable recycling goal for old iron and magnesium.                
&gt; 

Gee Martha! Magnesium heating up?  What a concept.  Wonder if they've been
working with Bradley or something?  So all we really need to bring along
are our old engine cases!  Yes!!  I had a cook stove in my garage and never
new it!  ;)
