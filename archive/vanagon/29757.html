I love these attempts to put words in my mouth-- it's a blast making
fun of them, and soooo appropriate.

Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please???

I started this thread for the purpose of making up silly &quot;PC-like&quot; names
for VOLKSWAGENS.  BUSES, to be exact. You know... the slow, noisy,
air-cooled vehicles most of us drive? And, the subject of this list???
Next thing I know, there's this flame war about a totally irrelevant
subject, in defense of people who have not been attacked in any way,
and who regard the Speech Police with even more contempt than most of
the rest of us.

if that was your purpose, why didn't you call it  &quot;vw names&quot; or something
like that?   No,  it seems more like to stir controversy, or flame wars.  Why
didn't you say then that you had worked with handicapped people, and they
think the name thing is silly?  (It is)  I don't know what anyone means by
PC, anyway, and I don't know what everyone likes to be called,  but if they
say &quot;physically challenged&quot;, why not?   Big deal.  And it's true.  I was on
crutches for 5 months from a broken leg,  and got a handicapped parking
permit.  Sometimes I called it the gimp parking spot.  But if someone else
called me that,  it would very likely be derogatory.  There is a difference
between making light of your own situation and being the butt of someone
else's humor.

btw, i don't know why &quot;white&quot; people are called &quot;caucasian&quot;.  Who came from
there, anyway?  And &quot;white&quot; people aren't white.
