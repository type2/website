&gt;When I first got the '72 whenever I filled it up a large amount of gas would
&gt;leak.  Found out that a rubber &quot;elbow&quot; on top of the gas tank had
dry-rotted.
&gt; It didn't cost much for a new elbow and it was easy to replace.  Getting to
&gt;was another matter though (Step 1:  Take out engine).
&gt;
This may be the exact problem I'm having with my '75!  Gas doesn't *visibly*
leak, but I get a gas smell in the cab every time I fill it up and take a
corner - lasts for 50 miles or so.. I thought the tank itself was leaking -
it is not the rubber gasket at the filler.  A leaky hose was found and
relaced by my mechanic (no fixee), and friend has opined that it may be the
&quot;overflow tube&quot; (where that is, I don't know...) allowing fumes into the bus.
 Otherwise, I'm clueless until I do Step 1 above - and for *that* investment
of work, I'll LIVE with the smell!...
