&gt; Subject: NEW E-MAIL ADDRESS FOR RON SALMON
&gt; Date: Wednesday, April 16, 1997 5:06 PM
&gt; 
&gt; My domain e-mail address (list_at_busdepot_dot_com) will continue to work.
&gt; 
&gt; But for any of you who have been e-mailing me at my personal e-mail
address
&gt; (expres_at_gnn_dot_com), 
&gt; that address is now history (a little sooner than I had expected).  My
new
&gt; direct e-mail address is ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com (although list_at_busdepot_dot_com
is
&gt; fine too).  I had hoped to let the netcarrier and gnn addresses overlap
for
&gt; a couple of weeks, but GNN had other ideas.  If you e-mail me at the GNN
&gt; address, whether or not it looks like it went through, it probably won't.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ron Salmon
