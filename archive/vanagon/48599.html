&gt; Gee, weren't we lucky that Gerry didn't have any 'plans' for vanagon_at_lenti!

Ah, although *I* don't have plans, the admins of the lenti net are planning to
use something else as a mail server as lenti really is supposed to be being
used for biological computation.  So, it's likely that the mailing list will
soon be vanagon_at_mail.med.umn_dot_edu (although lenti will work just fine with an
MX record repointing it.)  Just a heads up.
