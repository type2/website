Subject: Wanted: Manual transmission for 80 Vanagon

If anyone has a manual transmission for a 1980 Vanagon I have a friend that
is interested in buying it.

Incidentally her van has about 200,000 miles on it and it wont stay in
first gear, it pops out.  Two mechanics have diagnosed it as a faulty
transmission.

Thanks
