you will find a short description of their operation and images of 
their catalog for replacement sheet metal panels for early busses.

I don't really have any connection to Das Bulli Haus, but since the
subject of repair panels keeps coming up, and people keep buying the
Wolfsburg West panels and other companies stuff, and then writing in
to complain, I figured I'd just try and save people the hassle next
time.

well, it's nice of you to put up a web page for your friends.  I hear that
they make good parts and are the only source of repro sub floor pans
(essential for sunroof buses and buses with doors on both sides).
 Unfortunately the stamping is not exactly like the original, so if you know
what to look for, it would be obviously a replacement.   But you cant get
everything.   Though i would prefer new panels from a dealer, im pretty much
stuck.

But i must say that i havent seen anything complaining about Wolfsberg West,
and i have had good experiences with them.  In fact, i dont remember anyone
else mentioning them.  They know the buses, know what they are talking about
, and ship promptly.  Their sheet metal is happily wedded to the 66 standard
micro i drive, and very nice it is.   Though, as i said, i would prefer new
VW Genuine Parts; this is not perfect either.    They do stock some NOS parts
:)

I have seen some complaints about other mail order parts dealers, RMMW was
one, i think, but i have no experience there.   I dislike BusBoys because of
their bad rep on safaris, didnt know their parts the one time i called them,
and the sliminess of the guy who owns it (I can smell you from here-don't get
any closer!) 

 Standard disclaimer - i am not associated with any of these vw parts
manufacturers, nor are any of them my close buddies.
