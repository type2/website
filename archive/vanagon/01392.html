If you are in cold weather without the gas heater in the belly of your bus 
working and switched ON, the 'hot' air gets nicely cooled down by all that 
sheet metal it's keeping warm underneath, ie. _at_60mph, in slush etc.  I've 
removed the entire gas heater, used aluminium clothes-dryer pipe to replace 
it. Insulate this with 4&quot; wide plastic backed fiberglass pipe wrap, comes in 
rolls. This worked a charm. Seal up the cracks with muffler cement, and 
check the rest of the system for hot air leaks. The belly heater is more of 
a nuisance than it's worth (2 or 3 motors + fuel pump!), except for 10 
minutes in the morning in subzero weather ski-camping. You don't need it 
when driving if your system is OK! Make sure both heater flaps are fully 
open when the lever(s) is down. The old style gas heaters work better, 
especially if they are recent enough to pull the air to be heated from the 
passenger compartment, not the engine compartment! There are no mods. 
suitable for these older busses, beyond the above suggestion for insulation. 
Try packing the front kick panels with insulation also, keeps the 'up' pipe 
warmer. I find that wind chill is hard to beat, if you freeze over on the 
highway at 70mph in snow, try 60 mph! Warmest aircooled I had was a '71, 
58mph tops, drove in sock feet in the deep of winter, 'up' pipe too hot to 
rest my toes against.   tjs
        ps. All Canadian busses came with the Aux. gas heater (designed by 
Werner von Braun, I believe), except Vanagon H2O, which gets an additional 
H2O heater under the rear seat, toasty warm at any temp! I don't know about 
CDN Westi's and gas heaters, anyone?
