I made a little more progress on Sunday.  After carwashing the tin I 
set to cleaning and sanding.  I love my wire brush.  I finished four 
pieces and hope to finish the rest this evening.  I was looking at the 
Bus Stop catalog and their pictures in there to see what I might be 
missing.  I noticed they sell some aftermarket tin that looks like it 
goes below the regular tin.  I can't really tell from their diagram.  
They say it improves all regular tin and provides better cooling, etc.
Anybody have any experience with this stuff?  Is it worth my $16?

Also, I have a question about generators.  I still haven't found that 
little spring I screwed up but I haven't given up.  I am more worried 
about the fact that I do have some play in the unit itself.  Not a lot
but it is noticable.  Having worked on bikes I am trained in the fine 
art of noticing tiny amounts of bearing play.  I assume there will be 
some in even a new generator.  Am I wrong here?  It might not matter 
since I will have to replace to it if I can't find this spring.  Where
does one find cheap generators?  Cheapest I can find mail order is 
about $145.  For that price I will switch to an alternator.  Anybody 
have a known good one laying around?  How about a voltage regulator?  
I don't really have $30 for one of those either.  Thanks, Jim
