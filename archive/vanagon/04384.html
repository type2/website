&gt; So so sorry to bother the list, but I've tried many variations to no

&gt; Does anyone remember how to unsubscribe from this list, or how to get the
&gt; digest form?
&gt; 

send a message to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

the subject dosn't matter, i just don't put one in, but you can.

then in the body of the message put this;

set vanagon digest

and that's it. i have just spent some time going through the help for 
listserv looking for how to get OUT of digest mode.

the only way to get out of digest mode is to unsubscribe and then 
subscribe again, but at least it will allow you to do both in the same 
message.

p.s.
if you REALY want to stop getting the list, send a message as above, only 
instead of set vanagon diget in the body of the message, put this;

unsubscribe vanagon

but then you'll miss out on the fun, so try the digest first for a while.
