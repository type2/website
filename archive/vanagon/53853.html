&gt;&gt;From time to time, I hear people asking if anybody knows
&gt;a good Veedub mechanic. So, since I know one, I figgered it
&gt;might be a good idea to volunteer the information...
&gt;
&gt;I live in the Lansdale, PA area (not too far from Philly..), and
&gt;since I have moved here, I have been using a place called Autohaus,
&gt;run by Dave Fretz.
&gt;
&gt;Autohaus
&gt;1742 Schwenksville Rd
&gt;Schwenksville, PA 19473
&gt;(610)287-9608

Two others that I'd recommend in the Phila. area: 
Lehmanns Auto, Bechtelsville (near Pottstown) - highly recommended
CSE, Oreland (near Ft. Washington) - expensive but good
