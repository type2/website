Subject:      FS 74 camper, 90 GL auto in B'ham, AL ...

from today's Birmingham News (birmingham, alabama):

74 VW Camper. $700.  call (205) 933-5183

90 Vanagon, auto, a/c, 99K miles, runs exc.  $4950 obo. (205) 970-2234.

yes, that's what it says: $4950. must be wrecked or leaking head gaskets.
i think i might call tomorrow and see what's up. cause that's only a little
more than half of the going loan rate for that bus.
