&gt; Subject: VW-'71 BUS-QUESTION ABOUT MOUNTING BOLTS
&gt; 
&gt; I bought a long block for my '71 Bus but during installation it became
&gt; clear that the case didn't have the nut pressed into the upper left (as
&gt; you face the engine from the rear of the Bus) mounting hole.  With the
&gt; extra ducting on the fan housing for this year, I can't figure out a way
&gt; to get the nut on the bolt coming in from the front (by the clutch
&gt; adjustment nut).  My questions are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt;    1) Is there an easier way to get the nut on the bolt that the usual way
&gt;       of approaching it from the left side of the fan housing?
&gt; 
&gt;    2) Given that I have the three other 17mm nuts securely tightened, plus
&gt;       the rear mounting bar on, do I really need to get the upper left
&gt;       bolt on?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Nick

1. Some cases have a nut pressed in as you wished, so you just use the
right long bolt. Other cases require your helper to hold the nut on
the engine side while you crawl under the car with the bolt.

2. My neighbor repairs bugs as a hobby. He always uses three bolts
instead of four.
