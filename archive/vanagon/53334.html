Subject: Cold Weather Starting - 86 Syncro
Date: Thu, 19 Dec 96 20:16:00 CDT


Greeting from the bitterly cold upper midwest.  Here in Minneapolis it's 
approx 0 degree F - cold!  Moments ago I walked to the parking lot to jump 
into my Syncro hoping to drive away, but after cranking for a few moments I 
realized it wasn't going to start on the existing battery.  I have another 
fully charged battery,  but that didn't help.  So I lugged the extra in 
doors, borrowed a friends foot heater and it's warming now.

I tried probably 10 cranking cycles.  What about flooding?

This weekend I'll change the existing battery.  I'm hoping that solves the 
problem, but if not if it possible I have a fuel delivery problem triggered 
by the cold?  Either an abundance of fuel or a lack there of.

This is the second time this has occurred.  The same happened yesterday, I 
was able to start it with a jump from a running auto.

Regards,

Paul
