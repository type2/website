&gt;Has anyone on the list had to find a new AC Compressor for their Vanagon.  I
&gt;have had mine at the AC shop waiting for one since Tuesday and although they
&gt;say one has been located and is being shipped, I am beginning to doubt their
&gt;word.  Will only one kind of compressor work?  Is VWs method of mounting a
&gt;compressor that specific?

i can't believe that only one compressor would work ... my brother replaced
a bosch compressor (on his scirocco) with a Sankyo rotary compressor. the
only problem was fabricating a little metal bracket (to match the different
bolt positions).  see if they can cross-match something other than Bosch to
fit.
