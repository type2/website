Subject: Re: '69 Westfalia Camper 4 sale

neat stuff i have some photocopies arund from my subscription to Camp Box News that has pictures 
of westy setups that were only offered in germany. sounds like one of them is what you describe. due 
to poor copy qulaity it wouldn't be worth scanning in but i could make a photcopy if somebody was 
_really_ interested

&gt;

&gt; slightly different from the split kit, though, it has a sink.  still an SO
