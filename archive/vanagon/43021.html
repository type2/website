Subject: Rear brakes 78 Westy?

Hello All,

I have a 78 Westy and was working on the rear brakes.  No rubber plugs 
in backing plate resulted in frozen adjusters.  Had to drill out the 
old ones.  Thought about giving everyhting a good coating of Anti-sieze 
compound.  Is this stuff OK to use in the brake area?
    Another thing that I notices is that the pins that normally have 
the cup washer and spring to hold the brake shoes don't exist on my 
vehicle.  Is this normal?  There are no holes in the backing plate 
aside from the inspection and adjustment holes.

Any help &amp; info would be much appreciated.  

TIA,
Ralph Faber 
78 Westy (Das Bus)
