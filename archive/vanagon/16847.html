Subject: Re: Piston Pin

&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; I am doing a mini rebuild on my 80 vanagon. By mini rebuild I mean I am
&gt;&gt; &gt; changing the cylinders and pistions but do not spliting the cranckcase 
open.
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Everything has proceeded well except I can't get the piston pin out.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Any suggestions appreciated.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Need more details.  Can you not get the clip out?  Or the pin itself?
&gt;&gt; Which one?  All of them?  On my engine, I did this once with the engine
&gt;&gt; in the van and couldn't get the #3 pin out.  I had to grind a small
&gt;&gt; notch in the transmission case to get it out.

&gt;The engine is out of the van. I have also taken the circlip off. The rod
&gt;is still hooked up to the cranckshaft. The pin is too tight. And I didn't
&gt;want to bang on the pin being still connected to the cranckshaft.
&gt;

The last engine I took apart had little ridges built up around the circlip 
groove.  I couldn't get these pins out either.  I made a tool to pull the 
pin out.  It consited of a 3/8&quot; bolt and a 2 washers.  One washer was cut to 
make a &quot;C&quot; shape, while the other is normal.  You just slip the bolt through 
the pin and then slip on the C washer.  By tightning a nut on the bolt,  the 
pin will be pulled out.  Once the pin has reached the outside of the piston, 
You have to put a socket on the bolt and start tightning again.  
        The only other thing I had to do is file slightly on the bolt's head 
(at the points) so it would slip through the pin.  The bolt had a 9/16&quot;head. 
 It is best to use a bolt with threads the whole length, as you could put 
the socket on first, and pull the pin in one fell swoop.
        After the pin was out I noticed that the little ridge had been cut 
right out of the pistons.  H very sharp piece of aluminum, so be carefull.
  
Good luck.
