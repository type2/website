Subject: bodega campsites


Will the first person arriving Friday morning (or whenever earlier)
please leave a note at the entrance kiosk for the rest of the group
as to campsite directions/numbers/location, etc?  The campsites are
not a adjacently located next to one another the way they were at
Red Rock (more like at Big Sur, but with more trees).  From the
map I have, and my recollection of how the sites sit, I'd suggest
the following numbered sites, which, despite the numbers, are
all rather close to one another in a &quot;T-shaped&quot; intersection:

46 47 48 49 53 52 54 55 56 57

If it seems improbably we'll be able to get enuff sites there
adjacent to each other, then by all means, the first few vanagon
people entering should feel free to pick what they think is
the best alternative.  The sites I've mentioned look quite close to 
the beach/bay.
