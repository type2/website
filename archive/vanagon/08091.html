&gt;Problem is, the stuff that came out was milky looking. I assume my gas
&gt;somehow has gotten water in it.  The problems seem have occurred since my
&gt;last fill up and I am now on the bottom quarter of the tank.
&gt;Any comments regarding what I should do to drain the tank and whether or
&gt;not any damage has been done?  Besides changing the filter, is there
&gt;anything else I should do to try to purge the system or clean it out once
&gt;I drain the tank?

i would park the car with the nose uphill (or on ramps) and loosen BOTH of
the fuel hoses to the tank (there's one on the driver's side, too). and let
the fuel drain (into some sort of containers). i know it's a silly thing to
mention, but be sure to have a couple of gallons of NEW gasoline handy to
pour into the tank when you are done.

if possible, tilt the car a little bit to one side (like, have one ramp a
little bit higher than the other) so that will make the gas run more out
one hose.

hook up the hoses and lower the car, then put the new gas into the tank.
when you go to fill up the tank, put a bottle of fuel injector cleaner (like
Chevron Techron) in first ... it'll help get rid of any remaining water in
the system.

any damage that has been done is already done, and won't show up for a while.
hopefully, you caught it quick enough, and the fuel pump isn't harmed and the
gas tank hasn't begun to rust.

you didn't, by any chance, buy that tank of gas at a 7-11? or Zippy-Mart?
someone else talked about the same sort of thing a long time back. their bus
ran ok after draining and refilling. but they never got any satisfaction from
the yo-yo's that sold them the &quot;gasoline&quot;.

good luck.
