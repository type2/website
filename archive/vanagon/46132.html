Tires -
I have a set of Sumitomo's on my '80 Westi, love 'em. I drive about 
100 miles a day, up &amp; down the foothills to valley, about $50 each, 
with an 80,000 warranty.  I drive way to fast and they're hangin' in 
there.  I drive lots of small curvy roads in all weather (well, west 
coast US weather, anyway)

&gt; My tires tend to rot before I need to replace them from tread loss.  
&gt; Burning rubber isn't a specialty of this van.  But does anyone out there 
&gt; have a tire they just rave about?  I need a good town and short trip 
&gt; tire.  And being in Seattle I think a lot about hills and rain.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
