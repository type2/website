Subject: Yes, we have IDLE (most of the time)

Well, thanks to all here and to Bentleys and the fruition of a couple
months of thinking VW--Grasshopper, when you can drive on the rice paper
without leaving tracks, then you will be ready--I now have a nice, smooth
idle most of the time. I am plagued with the '71 (34PICT3/.009) problem,
but I had other problems which apparently were contributing significantly.
After getting my Bentley on Wed., I read up on adjusting idle, timing, etc.
and went at it yesterday. I managed to get rid of a pesky backfiring
problem, which was apparently caused by a combination of a maladjusted
carburator, overadvanced distributor, and tight valves on #3 and #4 (I
don't know what caused them to tighten so much, but the valves on #3 were
.002 and .003; I adjusted them to .006 about 750 or less miles ago).

Now my bus idles great once she warms up, but tends to stall until then.
She also seems to have a little less power than she did with everything out
of adjustment (don't get me wrong, I know I was hurting my engine with all
that backfiring; I'm not going back to that). My tach/dwell meter only
reads for 6/8 cylinder engines, so I lookek on the reading for 8 cylinders
and multiplied by two. With that technique, it looks like I'm at 1050 to
1100 with some occassional, minor fluctuation (which I'm thinking may be
relative to worn rings, though I haven't done a compression test
yet--bought the tester yesterday and hope to check this pm). I know these
RPM are a little high, but that's where she'll idle; below that, she stalls
even after warm-up.

I also looked at the path of the oil leak under the bus and from the words
in Bentley, I'm thinking my oil cooler may be leaking. Is this cause to
stop driving, or should I just keep adding oil 'til I save up the $$ to
pull the engine and do some work? I was thinking the leak was from my front
seal, but there's quite a bit coming down the on the left (from the back)
heat exchanger.

Hey, thanks to all of you for so much guidance and help. I'm like a
fledgling out here, but I feel safe under your wing. (Now, if I could only
find some rice paper to drive on).  8) Joe
