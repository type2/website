Subject: Well I got my new poptop gaskets...





It looks like I got dropped from the list.  I'm trying to get back on so
please bear with me if this is repetitive.

I got the new poptop seals for my '88, Thanks Ron. The back piece went on
quite easily and looks great.  My question concerns the front or cab
section.  I have visions of taking all the screws out, replacing the gasket
and then never being able to get section back on.  Is it as simple as it
looks?  Are the screws on the sides easy to realign?

Please respond directly to Paul_Dierze_at_lotus_dot_com

Thanks,

Paul

P.S. Any recommendations on campsites between Boston and Hilton Head or
nice roads that will keep me off 95 or stopping every 5 minutes at a
traffic light?
