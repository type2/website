Subject: '62:  all those window parts!

Well the new rubber etc. is going in my front door windows with
all the glass and little metal pieces.  What I can't figure
out is how to attach the metal piece with the notches in it
that the sliding windo latches to.  It has screw holes it it,
but there are none in the door top.  Does it screw into the
felt strip, rubber strip under that, or what?

Also, the above notched strip plus the metal u-channel that the
fixed window is attached to, I need one of each (I think for
the driver's door).  The PO is
looking for them but if he can't find them anyone have any
extras?

If anyone has redone their front door windows lately and wants 
to describe what they did, please do!
