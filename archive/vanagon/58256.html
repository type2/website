Subject: Re: Bentley EV manual - updated release date


&gt;Called this morning, saying &quot;is it time?&quot;  They said
&gt;yup, we have a firm date now (drum roll)
&gt;
&gt;September 1st!  (cymbal crash)
&gt;
&gt;Seems they reconsidered and have decided to include
&gt;the 97's after all.  The lady said this really is a firm
&gt;release date now.  No announced price yet.
&gt;
&gt;Stay tuned (as it were).  Maybe this time it'll really
&gt;happen.
&gt;

If it does really happen, I'll try to order a quantity at once and see if I 
can put together a list deal for EV owners.  Someone give me a kick in the 
butt when September rolls around if I forget.
