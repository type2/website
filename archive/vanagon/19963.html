Subject: Sold my '72, yea. Now &quot;wannabus&quot;


David Schwarze is now the proud (maybe) owner of my '72 Westy. I
thought I would make some East coast people jealous by saying that he
is only paying $100 for a vehicle that is ready to be put together,
with very minimal rust (only surface stuff). Bwahahahaha. The hard
part will be getting it down to San Diego (about a 9 hour drive from
my place).

So I need now to be reclassified. Since I have no money I am in no
hurry, I can be as picky as I want :) Let's put me down as wanting a
'71 bubble top.

Thom, great story the other day, you b*st*rd! :) Say hi to Amy for
me. I could almost believe that she would have said something that
nice. Argo says &quot;bark!&quot;. The skunk smell is mostly gone :)
