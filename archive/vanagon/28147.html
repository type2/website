Subject: new windshields

Hi Guys,
         I recently had SAFELITE auto glass install a tinted windshield.  The
         tint is dark blue...running 6&quot; along the top. It was an overcast,
         early morning time and having had a clear windshield before I assumed
         that the untinted part or the glass was clear...or at least it looked
         that way.  After assembling my van (I just had a paint job) I rolled
         it out the garage for the first time on a bright sunny day. 
         I immediately notice that the &quot;clear&quot; part of the windshield has a 
         noticable ugly green cast.  I called SAFELITE and they replyed that 
         that's the way they all are these days and I was stuck with it because
         I accepted it and now it was &quot;used glass&quot; (does that have the same
         stigma as a &quot;used woman&quot;?) All I wanted them to do was replace it with
         a true clear glass with no tinting...I'd even pay for the labor.
         No, they wouldn't budge.  So I did what every young blooded American
         does when he's treated like dirt by a business.  I put a stop on the
         check!

         What has been your experience with replacement windshields?  Is green
         tinting the new standard? Is there different quality in windshields and
         if so what do I look out for?
