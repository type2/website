Subject: tear-drop trailer


I just saw a cute tear-drop trailer in restoration today.  I WANT one!


If anyone knows of one for sale please let me know.  I heard that
there was a guy who was selling repros of them.  If anyone knows
anything about that, I'd be interested, too.

Thanks in advance,

Martha
