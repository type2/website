&gt;&gt;  I am new
&gt;&gt;to my area so I asked at the local import Parts store where to get a good
&gt;&gt;alignment at a reasonable price. 
&gt;
&gt;I'm over in St. Louis (not TOO far from Carbondale), and I've had great
&gt;service from a Firestone dealer.  I'm always charged the same rate as
&gt;everyone else, they have great equipment, and they always do a great job.
&gt; They actually like to see me come in, because they can align both the front
&gt;and rear, which makes it easier for them (so they say, anyway).
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!

I've had similar luck at my local Les Schwabb.  When we got our bus it
wasn't fun to drive on bridge decks or grooved pavement, crosswinds, past
trucks, you know...

  The 4 wheel alignment was $24.00, and the guy showed me the numbers and
said the he loved working on it because it was the most &quot;alignable&quot; car he'd
worked on.  Apparently he wasn't kidding because it goes straight down the
worst of roads hands off.  We've put over 50,000 miles on those tires and
they still look new.
