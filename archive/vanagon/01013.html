Subject:      Re: grills, grills, grills

&gt;&gt;anybody know of a north american source of replacement
&gt;&gt;radiator grills for a 4 light system? not the late model
&gt;&gt;rectangular lights, but a grill that will accept 7&quot;
&gt;&gt;round lights.

you might try those customizing folks that make Kamei (sp?) stuff for golfs
and rabbits and such. i remember an article in one of the magazines where they
did up a vanagon. it had a grill with the 7&quot; headlights, and inboard had two
5&quot; driving lights (kinda like the rabbit/golf setup). at the time, they
repplied to my letter than they were not going to import it to this country.
but that was years ago. maybe they've changed their minds.
