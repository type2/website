&gt; Hi All:  Well, by the time I checked my mail the question had already
&gt; been answered. I can add a few things though.  As has been mentioned a
&gt; Tristar is a deluxe model of a Transporter. The four doors are the big
&gt; change and in my 91 it is loaded with power mirrors, power locks, power
&gt; windows,  drivers seat heater, Alloys. From talking to other Transporter
&gt; owners it sounds like the headliner and the upolstry are more deluxe. I
&gt; keep finding out about differences as time goes by. There are no
&gt; Transporters around here to compare mine to so it is hard for me to
&gt; determine all of the differences. I did hear that the rear side windows
&gt; in the Transporters are solid. My windows are sliders. There should be a
&gt; lot of changes because the I understand Tristar package was around
&gt; $10,000 on top of the price of a Transporter. I guess that is why VW
&gt; didn't sell many. From all of the pictures I have seen of Tristars, they
&gt; all seem to have a different configuration of roll bar/brushguard
&gt; setups. BTW, The roll bar/brush guards are factory, my brushguard has
&gt; factory part numbers stamped in it along with with a VW emblem. I have
&gt; seen pictures of Tristars that have smooth sides on the sidegates. Mine
&gt; are corrigated like the Transporters.  I need to get some pictures taken
&gt; so I can put them on a website. It doesn't seem to quit raining up here
&gt; long enough to get it done.
