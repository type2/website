Subject: Blizzak tires

Has anyone got Blizzak snow tires on their van?  Do they have a model 
which is tough enough for the requirements of the Vanagon?  The 
marketing campaign has me wondering about their performance, and the 
Corrado list was singing praises for these things a while ago.

Brian.
