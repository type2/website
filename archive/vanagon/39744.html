&lt;great discussion on oil temperature senders, and where to install them&gt;

I noticed that you did not recommend the oil pressure relief valve gallery.
I have installed my oil temperature sensor in this location because: it was
easy (just had to match the threads in the case with those on an adapter);
the oil is flowing over the sensor; and the oil is hot. The adapter does not
interfere with the workings of the pressure relief spring or valve. What are
the drawbacks of using this gallery for the temperature sender?  BTW, VDO
sells the sending unit (with the proper adapters) for using the pressure
relief gallery.

Thanks in advance
