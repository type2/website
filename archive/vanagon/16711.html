Subject: Re: Maytag Parts Washer

&gt; I inspected it and found out that it was a 194? Maytag Gyratator  
&gt;clothes
&gt;washer (with a built on motorized wringer.  The neat thing is that  
&gt;it looks
&gt;like a perfect parts washer (with a little modification).


Ron:

Old Maytag stuff is getting pretty collectible now.  I attend a lot  
of antique power equipment shows and the little maytag 2 stroke  
kick start engines that went with these washers are fetching a  
pretty good price.  The washers and especially accessories (meat  
grinder and ice cream freezer) that attached to the washer are going  
nowhere but up in value.  You may want to ask around a little  
before you alter it too much. Just a thought.
