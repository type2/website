================
I have changed shocks on both a '73 and '82 bus.

On the '73  I recall that all the shocks were the simple bolt on type you find
on most cars, with a transverse bolt on the bottom .  I did this a LONG time
ago, and so don't recall how the front upper mounts fastened, but I don't
recall anything special or unusual.  I think I did the fronts, I know I did
the rear.  I know I did not have to use a spring compressor at all.

On the '82, I did last year:  the rear shocks were standard  configuration
with a transverse mounting bolt top and bottom.  The front ones looked a
little unusual in appearance, (made in South Africa, and instead of the
conventional deep drawn sheet metal tube,  appeared to be more like a piece of
2&quot; pipe with a flat top and bottom welded on) but had a simple nut on the top
of the piston rod, and a transverse bolt at the bottom of the housing.  The
front shock replacement was a simple unbolt and drop out/push in to remove and
replace, no spring compressor required, and I don't think I even had to jack
up the wheel or body to change either front or rear.
