Subject: Re: Upper Bushings [Also netiquette]

This needed to be forwarded manually to the list becuase of the way the 
included messages was included.

A note of caution...including entire messages in replies is considered
rather rude and especially on this list since it is plenty busy.  It's 
not like it's days until you see the next message.

Forewarned. (and forwarded &lt;smile&gt;)
