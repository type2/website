&gt;so i put a new stereo in the beast yesterday.  home built kicker box,
&gt;nice amp, nice head, reasonable three ways.  sound good. sounds good.
&gt;sounds good!!!! [say that to yourself, it won't make any sense after a few
&gt;repititions...kinda like 'egg']  anyway i'm getting interference.  there's
&gt;a high wistle from the tweeters that follows engine rpm.  how do i make it
&gt;go away?

like someone already said: triple check all your ground connections, and
your battery connections. also you could go all-out and shield the
distributor (like some of the later vanagons).
if you know someone who is a mobile ham radio enthusiast, he should be able
to give lots of hints/tips about silencing engine noise on car radios and
speakers. also you can check at Radio Shack (or ARRL for books on how to
do this). there are lots of simple cheap things to try first before you
spend big bucks on interference kits.
