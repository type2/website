Subject: Exhaust fumes in early buses


To all:

The heat exchangers on upright engines are virtually guaranteed not to leak
exhaust fumes into the heater channel, thanks to their thicker steel walls
and the surrounding aluminum fins.  But a common  exhaust leak is where the
heat exchanger fastens to the muffler.  A relatively small leak in this area,
especially if directed upward, can blow exhaust gases into the heating
circuit if the sleeves fastening the heat exchanges to the plenum chambers
are not a perfect fit.  The higher velocity of the exhaust gas has no problem
overcoming the blast of air from the blower housing at that short distance.

If you have an early bus and if the heater smells of exhaust fumes, the joint
between the heat exchangers an muffler should be one of the first things to
check.  

The plenum chambers on Brazilian mufflers are a particularly poor fit and may
require a bit of tin-bending to achieve a tight system.

In about half the cases where a customer complains of exhaust fumes coming
from the heater, the problem is not the exhaust system or heater but failed
engine compartment seals, particularily around the engine compartment hatch.
 

In many cases, complaints of exhaust fumes turn out to be oil rather than
exhaust, with the fumes being drawn into the blower from a variety of
sources.  A loose or missing crankcase ventilation tube is the most common
cause in this case but spilled oil and a leaking oil cooler will produce the
same symptoms.
