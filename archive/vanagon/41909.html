Subject: Weekend fix-it fun

        Greetings. Well I finally fixed that pesky rear wiper pump. It just
wasnt shooting anything onto the window, and when I finally got someone to
press the spray lever while I was standing back there, I noticed that it
was actually leaking inside the van up near the roof, just where the pump
ohse comes out of the side, and makes the little segment across into the
rear hatch. The fluid was soaking quite alot. So upon removal of all the
side panels, and the one large back hatch panel I discovered that the hose
had been severed right inhalf  inside the hose gaurd just outside the rear
hatch. A short trip to my FLAPS to purchase some new hose then a mouthful
of curses trying to fit the hosing over the spray nipple, and all was done.
Hurrah, my first fix!
        So even though it works like a charm, Im still worried about what
the severed hose had done certain places in the walls. Just below where the
fluid resevoir is, you can tell some of the fluid must have leaked cause
its all rusty. Whats the best way to stop this now? Should I snadpaper away
the rust that exists and then spray some primer over it. Its inside the
wall, but obviously it should be attended, no?
        Also, Im having a hard time finding some floor mats that fit, can
ayone mention any brand names or models that do fit? I could buy some and
cut them to fit, but woudl rather not.

        T-minus 15 days till insurance and the beginning of Mike's
road-trip mania. Ill be going to Cataman caves to do some caving the day it
insured, then probably Sylvan Lake the next week, and then finally from Aug
3rd - 18th its out to the west coast for Lollapolluza 1996!!

thanks in advance.
