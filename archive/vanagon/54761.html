Subject: Seeking Buses in Iowa

Hello!

I've been lurking around the VW list digests and web sites for some 
months now. Time to come into the light.

I'm a college student in Grinnell, IA who is interested in VW Buses and 
Vanagons (I'm hoping to acquire a Westy Vanagon either this summer or 
next) and I'm meanwhile interested in meeting any VW van owners in Iowa 
or anywhere near the Iowa border (basically, no more than about a 3-hour 
drive away.) I'd like the chance to poke over - and maybe drive - a 
Bus/Vanagon, or just learn more.

If you think you're included and are interested, address replies to:

Thanks!
   - Jennifer
