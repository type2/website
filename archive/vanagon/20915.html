&gt;Has anyone any idea if an RV type roof mounted unit would work for a
&gt;Vanagon. There was a 13,500 BTU unit FS in the local classified, someone got
&gt;it before I could check it out. 13.5K Btu is a lot of cooling power!  tim s.

my understanding, from reading those RV magazines, is that the roof-mounted
a/c units are 120 volt AC units. :( i.e., they don't get used running down the
highway (unless you are also running the generator). one fellow here in town
has one on top of his 80 vanagon ... but he also has a small generator on his
front bumper.

or at least, he HAD a small generator up there ... i think he might had
rear-ended someone and &quot;rearranged&quot; the generator. :(
