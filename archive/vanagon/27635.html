Subject: Switch question

I just have a question about a switch on the front (fif) of the transmission
on the '72 Westy.  There are two, one on the left front and one on the top of
the front.  The one on the left has two wires, one for each terminal, which
is good because if it didn't my back up lights wouldn't work.  The other only
has one wire that goes from one terminal to the frame/transmission ground
strap.  The other terminal has nothing.  It looks lonely.  I am curious as
what this switch is for.  I've had the Westy for 7 years and haven't yet seen
a need for the switch other than to keep from having an open hole in the
trany.  Any ideas?
