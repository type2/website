Subject: RE: AC Question

&gt; Get a new mechanic.  The compressor has no dependency on the state of charge at AC startup time.
&gt; 
Hmm.  My A/C certainly DOES depend on this.  There is a pressure switch just
inside the left rear piller-cover (an '86 GL) that reads the freon pressure.
If the freon is gone, and the pump starts up, then this switch must also be
bad -- it breaks the circuit to the A/C clutch, I think, since all the fans
work regardless of freon charge -- just not the compressor clutch.

Give you mechanic another chance before you dump him!
