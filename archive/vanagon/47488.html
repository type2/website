My '80 Westi has/had the piece of metal you all are referring to.  It 
is a heat shield, mine just bit the dust a few months ago.  I will 
check my engine seal. I still have the bulk of it remaining.  &lt;What 
sort of packrat would keep a burned up, unattachable former piece of 
VW&gt; A VW owner, that's who.
It's not a sandwich though, just a piece of metal.

&gt; &gt;original equipment beyond the heater boxes. Was that the purpose of this
&gt; &gt;piece and if so, would it aid cooling to rig a shield over the muffler?
&gt; 
&gt; I think it's a heat shield.  It's a very hard to find piece, because they
&gt; tended to rust out and fall off.  I ran without one for a while and it
&gt; eventually caused my foam engine seal to get crispy on the lower parts in
&gt; the back.  I'm sure it affected the temperature of the air entering the
&gt; engine, too.  Good thing to have, if you can get it.

I just replaced the plastic generator cage, about $7.50 US
&gt; a recent problem saw the end to my fan cage and generator surround.
