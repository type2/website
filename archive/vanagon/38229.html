&gt;&gt;&gt; Thats all I know.  On the slight chance that someone is interested, =
&gt;&gt;I'll

&gt;Sorry All.  That phone # is (907) 488-7448.   I just talked to the fellow
&gt;who owns it and he said that the engine is there and untouched.  But the
&gt;passenger side is pushed all the way in to the center of the van.  He says
&gt;it is quite totaled.  I will look at it this afternoon and post more.

Just got back from looking at this van.  It is a GL five speed.  To say
that it was hit hard is an understatement.  It was t-boned on the passenger
side and bent in half.  Every pannel (w/the possible exception of the hood)
is warped.  This van may be useful if you need a motor and nick-naks but it
has no hope whatsoever of ever driving again.
