&gt; Bill,  Although I don't live in Santa Cruz I would recommend the VOLKS
&gt; CAFE.  I have had great service from them.

I'd second that recommendation.  They are experienced, honest, and Kyle,
the assistant manager, is a really nice guy.  When my wife and I took our
cross-country trip last fall, Kyle was a tremendous help in checking out
our Vanagon prior to purchase, and doing whatever repairs were neccessary
to make the journey completely trouble-free (and at a reasonable cost).
