Subject: RE: One Way Vaccum Valve? -or- Could this be the problem?


&gt;okay, been cruising round lately, me and rumba, doing great...then 
yesterday i
&gt;notice a definite lack of power and my brakes are stiff. hmmm...maybe i 
hear
&gt;a vaccum leak to..hmmm...okay, i've yet to track down the leak but i got 
some
&gt;new vacuum hose and will put that on shortly. question: what is the purpose 
of
&gt;a one way vaccum valve? i have one that joins two seperate vaccum 
hoses..which
&gt;is really one..but joined together by this one way vacuum valve. do these 
wear
&gt;out? do they get clogged? i hear a leak under there..seems to be coming 
from
&gt;this valve...any suggestions? on a side note, i cleaned the carb and put on 
a
&gt;new fuel filter, both were dirty and now we seem to run better.

I had a bad one-way valve (&quot;check valve&quot;) in my '71 bus. When ever the
engine conked out at an intersection (which it did a lot, grrr) the
brakes would immediately get very stiff, losing the power assist. Replacing
the valve (and the hoses) cured it.
