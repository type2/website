Subject:  Re: four-position wiper stalk, 78 bus -Reply

If the old buses have this four-position stalk (I'm not sure if my '78 does
or not, I've never tried it) it would be cool if intermittent wipers could be
retro-fitted to old buses.  I remember someone mentioning something
about a wiper relay?  How would one go about finding out if one of the
newer relays would fit an older bus?  Intermittent wipers would be nice
:) .
