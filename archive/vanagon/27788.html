Subject: Durham NC Gathering - Wed. 11/1/95


This is an open invitation:

some of US are getting together tomorrow, Wednesday 11/1 to meet, rap, oogle,
and share a meal.

6:30pm - Brightleaf Square parking lot - between Duke and Gregson streets 
in Durham NC.  Drive your VW.  Bring friends, family.

We will hang out in the parking lot for a while and then walk somewhere 
to eat supper.

Email me if you need directions.

If you get there and the busses are there but the people are not, check 
for a note under the wipers on my '76 yellow camper telling where we went.
