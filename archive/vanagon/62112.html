Subject: rear springs

Ok, so I have to have the frame sprung to get a proper alignment but 
that still leaves the rear end listing problem to contend 
with....I'm wondering how much aftermarket springs for the rear 
should cost and if anyone has experience replacing these. Thanks in 
advance for any advice,
Rick
