 Enough for C-c-c-canada? 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;last year, so I am told, Ottawa had two 
&gt;weeks of sustained -30 C weather so I don't know

Get your heater boxes fixed FIRST, and as others have said, seal up the air 
pathways tightly. I've had a VW bus in Canadian winters every year for 22 
years, and the gas heater alone won't keep you warm on the road. It has only 
enough power to create large amounts of fog/droplets on the windscreen when 
driving. Camping is another matter, warm and toasty after 10-12 minutes, 
enough to crawl out of your sleeping bag, get dressed and then put on frozen 
ski boots! 
        Those electric booster heaters consume huge amperages, 40-&gt;80 amps 
was posted a while back by Joel w. I think.... your alternator will likely 
go since it's not meant for continuous duty. They only raise the temp. by 
10-15 degrees F, not a hell of a lot.
        I too have a spare gas heater, old style, in my basement. I haven't 
the courage to install it in my Vanagon for ski-camping, but it would be 
nice on those camping cold mornings. A Canada Customs guy once told me of 
one exploding, when he heard mine running.
        I have always removed every piece of the interior panelling of every 
bus and properly insulated the beasts. You can fit 2-3 inches of fiberglass 
pink into every body cavity. Up to 6&quot; behind the front kickpanels in 
Microbusses. This makes one HUGE difference. Vapour seal the entire 
wall/door with a sheet of medium weight plastic, then pop/screw back in your 
panels and cut off the excess plastic neatly without nicking the paint. I 
usually spray some &quot;RustCheck&quot; into the cavities before insulating. 
        The roof of busses can't be insulated easily, campers impossible 
since the wood panelling presses against the steel. The pop-top should get a 
sheet of 1/2 inch styrofaom board fitted as neatly as possible into the roof 
cutout, you can't do much more than this. Don't use styrofoam elsewhere if 
you can avoid it, it squeaks while you drive! Standard VW roof insulation is 
1/2&quot; fiberglass pad glued to the roof behind the headliner, this is a tough 
act to follow, but can be done. You may wreck the headliner getting access 
etc. etc. I wouldn't do it without some experienced autoshop help. Getting 
suitable fiberglass for the roof may also be a pain, nothing like a steady 
shower of fiberglass dust while you drive!! Best roof option is to rip out 
the head liner, put in full length sheet metal tracks, bent up, and use 1/8&quot; 
white melamine surfaced particle board. You'll need 3 4'x8' sheets, and 
plastic panel joint strips. You can insulate behind this easily. Use 
mattress carton cardboard to make up a template prior to cutting the 
melamine, fitting will still be difficult. This has to be a good curved up 
fit or the ceiling will invert onto your head. Don't overstuff the 
insulation, it will fluff up later.

&gt;My key concern is not repeating my experience with my Karmann Ghia - 
&gt;scraping ice off the INSIDE of the windshield while driving down the 
&gt;highway in December....
&gt;
Cheap trick, use double sided tape to hold a deep plastic soap on your dash. 
Fill it with windshield  washer antifreeze and keep a sponge in it. Just 
wipe your windows clear!! I too had a K-G with no defrosters.

PS... it's the miniscule amount of heat that fogs/frosts your windows, 
thus.. no heat no fog! Turn off the heat completely, open the vent 
windows... and voila. Your breathe condenses in front of your face, drifts 
out of the way and your windows stay clear, cheap and simple. Dress warmly 
though, windchill at 60mph is wicked even inside your bus.


&gt;Thanks in advance - DC &gt;   No problem, tim s.
