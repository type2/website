Subject: Re: sychroning carbs

&gt;The problem is that:
&gt;1.)  I hate to give a grease monkey any more money to work on my bus.
&gt;2.)  I don't know of any efficient way to sychronize the carbs.

Since you only have two, it should not be that difficult.  I used to sync 
the carbs on my '55 Speedster with nothing more than a screwdriver and an 
airflow meter (about $10).
