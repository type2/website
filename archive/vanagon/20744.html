&gt; 
&gt; i stopped by the magazine store to get a copy of a mag on electric cars
&gt; (but more from that mag later), and also picked up a copy of Scale Auto
&gt; Enthusiast (cause i build plastic models) ... and on page 3 was an ad
&gt; for Mountain State Hobby Supply in Teays, WV. big deal, you say. yes, well,
&gt; what caught my eye was:
&gt; 
&gt; Revell Germany Cars
&gt; H7330 VW Bus ELW ........... 22.50
&gt; H7380 VW Bus UN ............ 24.50
&gt; 
&gt; so naturally, i had to call and foolishly order one of each. he said the
&gt; ELW is a fire truck!! and the description he gave is that it is a double-cab
&gt; pickup with a &quot;cage&quot; on the back for the fire equipment. that fits with some
&gt; pictures i've seen in books. :) :) :)  so when i get them next week, i'll
&gt; let you know what they look like.
&gt; 
&gt; ok. so what about the non-vanagons on the list? well, he said he also has
&gt; the 1/25th scale Corrado and Jetta and Beetles (hard top and cabrio), as
&gt; well as a whopping big 1/16 scale beetle.
&gt; 
&gt; not enough, eh? how bout (ready for this, Alistair???) ...
&gt; H7503 Unimog with snowplow and spreader body .... 41.00
&gt; H7505 Unimog RW-1 ............................... 54.00
&gt; 
&gt; i asked about an old Revell of Germany kit of the breadloaf passenger wagen
&gt; .. he didn't have any, but said he orders direct from germany so he's going
&gt; to check on that and some older bus kits. :)
