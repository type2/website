Arie -

When was the last time your fuel filter was replaced and the injectors
checked/cleaned?  I have found that in most AFC and Digijet models that I've
owned this is more often than not the cause of the problem.  More serious
causes would be the Air Box (or Air Flow Meter) attached to the Air Filter in
where the flap is cracked or bent, but there's a real slim chance of that.

Since owning fuel injection VW's, I make it a point to change the fuel filter
and air filter every oil change and usually run a bottle of Chevron's Techron
(tm) in the fuel tank at least once a month.  Haven't had the problem since.

But then again, it could be something else I haven't run across.
