Subject: Re: Pop-tops and nuking thieves

&gt;Hello,
&gt;I am new to the list, I only discovered it last week and have been 
&gt;lurking since then.  I've got a '72 Bus with the Westy pop-top.  The 
&gt;question I have is will a '78 Westy top fit onto my '72 bus.  The top 
&gt;I have is in very ragged condition, the fiberglass is very rough and 
&gt;the canvas top is in shredds.  I was at a junk yard the other 
&gt;day and they had a receint arrival of a '78 camper.  The top was in 
&gt;great shape and I could get quite a deal on both the fiberglass hard 
&gt;top and the canvas.  I know they pop up in opposite directions,
&gt;but if I just flip it around will it bolt right on?
&gt;
&gt;Is this going to too much trouble?  

I remember reading an article in the Limbo newsletter a while back about
such a swap.  
The article wasn't very technical, but it covered the main points.   I'll
post the article if I can dig it up tonight.  The big advantage to this swap
is getting the nice large bed versus the little cot.  Bigger is better!
