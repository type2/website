Subject: Re: Westy tent - setting up

Quoth David Carment:
&gt; 
&gt; Please provide some details on this tent. Is this basically an awning? Is
&gt; it OEM? Where can we get one?
&gt; 
Just a reminder of the (in)famous Westy tent page:

http://www.polaris_dot_net:80/user-www/jclark/tents.html

The picture I have there of the tent you're talking about does a better 
job at showing the subjective _experience_ of this tent than the nuts and 
bolts of its construction, but you'll get the idea.

BTW folks, my Pentium did arrive so as soon as I can get a few days off 
the road (jet-setting fixer of archaic computers) I'll be re-scanning the 
gifs and reformatting the pages -- which I can finally SEE -- to include 
adding the Dove Mfg. rooftop tent pix kindly supplied by Michael Heron.  
I'll try to find a better photo of a later tent.

I'm assuming I should design the page for best viewing at 640x480.  The 
pix will all be clickable for separate download, and I'll try to get rid 
of the annoying dithers.
