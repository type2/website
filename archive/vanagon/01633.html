Yeah, my sister had a problem with her fastback.  She thought that it was 
the clutch cable, but she said that the clutch pedal wasn't on the 
floor.  So when I looked at it I saw 3-4 broken bolts, the rest had 
already fallen out.  Fortunatly the left overs were loose, so it was easy 
to get them out.  I just replaced them with standard hex head bolts 
because I didn't have an 8mm 12 point at the time.  So, as I saw someone 
mention, it's 6mm hex on one side, and 8mm 12 pt. on the other.
