&gt;I was recently discussing winter vanagon experiences with a buddy of mine,
&gt;and he mentioned that a limited slip rear differential was a factory option
&gt;for two-wheel drive models.  I know a locking differential was a syncro
&gt;option, but was a similar rear diff available for two-wheelies?
&gt;
&gt;

I've got the Bentley manual and all of the sales brochures from '87 to '91
and there's no mention of any Limited-Slip Differential.  Only the locker for
the Syncro.
