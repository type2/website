Subject: Bug-Out happenings

Here's a little snippet about what was happening at the Bug-Out in Manassas, VA
this past Sunday.What a weekend!

 My Bug-Out experience started on Saturday, during the prep for the show.At
about 4PM, I decided to polish the wheels on my Notchback. (I still haven't had
time to rebuild the Vanagon tranny yet!) As long as I had all of the wheels off,
I also decided to give the brakes a quick flush/bleed, as it had been a couple
of years, and the pedal was getting a bit spongy. Well, I'm doing the one-man
method where you use a hose from the bleeder to a jar of fluid. I like to just
barely crack the bleeder screws, so that it takes a lot of pedal pressure to
force the fluid out. So I'm happily bleeding away, pushing REAL hard on the
brake pedal, and the pedal suddenly sinks right to the floor! I press the pedal
a few more times (as if I expect it to magically recover) as I bemoan my fate.
Turns out the metal brake line from the front to back rusted out. So I had the
fun task of replacing that animal. By time I get to the store, buy the parts,
remove the seats and carpet,install the line, bleed the brakes again, and polish
the very tarnished wheels, it is 1:30 AM on Sunday.

Sunday morning: Up at 6:00 am. Drive to friends house, and on to Manassas.
Stopped at supermarket for supplies. I didn't know how may burgers I would give
out to Listmembers, but to be safe, I buy 15 lbs of hamburger and mondo rolls,
chips,etc. Got to Manassas right at 8:30 AM---IT IS PACKED IN THERE!! Guy at
gate doesn't want to let me in the show, says it is filled. Squirm my way in
anyhow. (I gotta get there earlier next time!) Set up Notchback in show area and
start looking around.

First stop: SWAP MEET!
I love the swap meet section. I used to take down loads of parts until they
started charging $50.00 per spot! Not too much going on there. Saw one pair of
crusty Safari windows, and a set of side windows (louvered) for a 1960's Westy.
Two different individuals had the complete breadloaf Westy setup for sale.
Another was selling just the stove unit for one. Several Bus IRS tranny's, also.
One guy had a blue '81 Westy for sale--$2500!! It was in decent condition, small
amounts of surface rust and worn paint.

Next stop: VENDORS!
Saw a few things down there. First, there was a guy selling class III trailer
hitches for Vanagons--I think it was Derek's buddy. I bought a new, genuine VW
windshield for my Vanagon for $145.00. Does anybody know if this is a good
price, or did I get squealed?? Most of the other parts were for Type I's.

Next stop: SHOW!
Headed right for the Type II section. Very impressive turnout. Saw everything
from splitties to Eurovans. Saw fellow listmember Pete Krough's '85 Westy in the
show. God, I need a pop-top! They are too cool!! Seriously thinking about
selling my '88 and getting a Weekender or full Westy.

Next stop: LUNCH!
Fired up the grill and relaxed, taking in the VW ambience. The view from my spot
was incredible! Directy behind me, a forest green '59 Single cab. Next to it, a
two-toned blue '86 (?) Crew cab fron Ontario. Further down, a wonderful
red/white 1960's crew cab. Life was good. Threw several burgers on the grill,
and sat back with a few cold ones. During the course of the day, met listmembers
Pete Krough, Chris Chubb, Bill Killian &amp; Wife &amp; baby. Ran into
many-non-listmember VW friends, also. Went home at about 4:30 pm-wet and tired.

Oh yeah, I might have forgotten that it rained. Minor technicality!

Also, if anybody runs across a diesel Vanagon, Westy or Non-Westy on the East
Coast for sale, let me know! Thanks!
