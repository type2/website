Subject: Re: baja trip - dates?



To All:

If you want to do the Gulf down as far as San Felipe, you cross at Mexicali.
 If you want to see Baja you cross at Tijuana, hang a right and pick up the
toll road as far as Ensenada. 

If you're coming from Phoenix and want to do San Felipe, crossing at San Luis
or Algogones can make sense (if the crossings are open), but crossing at
Tecate adds hours to the trip to Ensenada and is impractical if you're
heading for San Felipe.

Tijuana-going-south is the most practical crossing; it's a drive-thru.  The
trick is getting home.  

Coming north, if you figure a nominal two hour run from the border to the LA
basin... only to discover you must add four hours of waiting (which is a fair
average if you arrive at the crossing between 1700 and 2100) it can really
foul up your next day's schedule.

Our usual routine is to NEVER cross the border on a weekend; to make the
north-bound crossing about noon on a weekday, and to transit the border
region as quickly as traffic permits.

The first logistical problem is to decide on a destination, work out the
travel times from there.  (l've never gone south just for a weekend; none of
the places I frequent are within a day of the border.  But I've gone back and
forth doing odd jobs, including weekends.)

(Of course, if you want to see what they mean when they say 'off-pavement'
you go to San Felipe... and keep going :-)
