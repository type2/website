                      RE&gt;Idle Stablizer Rebuild?                   11/22/95

Kirk van Druten asked
&quot;Has anyone had any luck rebuilding/lubricating an intermittently stuck Idle
Control Valve Stablizer Unit?  I'm talking about the cylindrical doohickey
that
sits on top of the intake manifold and vibrates it's little heart out.  Mine
seems to get stuck (the valve, not my heart, thank goodness) every once in a
while.  Usually in the morning.  I live in San Francisco so it's not like it's
feezing up due to outside temperature.

My current favorite remedy is to pull the hose to the air intake and 'install'
a
small screwdriver into the unit to loosten a stuck something (is there a
piston
in there?).  Works every time, but a drag if you have stuff loaded in the rear
cargo area and/or bikes on the back...

Suggestions?&quot;

===============================
This is very similar to the system (BOSCH Motronic) used on a lot of BMWs. 
Folks on that net have talked about cleaning their valves by removing the
valve from the vehicle and throughly flushing with carb. cleaner spray.  I
think you need to keep a few things in mind if you decide to do this:
o  remove from vehicle before cleaning
o  flush throughly and allow to dry throughly before re-installing
o  I have heard about a carbon buildup in one or two cases of these valves, 
carb cleaner may not wash that away
o  the internals that move in these valves appear to be a plastic piston with
a rubber washer or grommet/&quot;piston ring&quot; - some solvents may attack these
parts
o  You are absolutely correct in your discription of the valve that &quot;vibrates
its's little heart out&quot;, in order to do this, the moving parts and bore must
be clean and free of any thing that could cause drag or sticking that would
interfere with the &quot;piston's&quot; ability to physically respond (open/close a
port) to the electrical drive signal that goes into this valve.
