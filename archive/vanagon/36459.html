&gt; BTW we blew his (our neighbor) mind this weekend...bought a new kitchen
&gt; set (table and 6 chairs) still in their packing boxes...not a problem
&gt; pop down the rear seat...slide in the box with the table (30 x 60 x 8),
&gt; and three boxes containing the chairs (24 x 24 x 36). Still had room
&gt; to seat the (now) 3 year old kid in the remaining jump seat in the back...
	
	Yeh!  And we did similar to the wharehouseman when he thought it
couldn't be done but we slid a queen size boxspring (in the box) in the back
of Stella along with a full load of groceries and a couple large plants.

No problem.
