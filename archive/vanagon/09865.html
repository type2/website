Subject: Re:  Vanagon Disaster Prevention

This is a known problem (it's even talked about in Bentley).  There
is a new O-ring that isn't supposed to break in the cold.

- Frank

 &gt;This is for those of you who are &quot;fortunate&quot; enough to own a Vanagon with 
 &gt;an oil cooler.  CHECK IT NOW !  Before it's too late  !
 &gt;The other day it was -35 out, yes I said -35 and that's centigrade for you 
 &gt;Americans, my female partner went out, started the van to warm it up for her 
 &gt;drive to work.  After having some breakfast and getting dressed she went out 
 &gt;and next thing I hear is, FRANK ! something's wrong with the van !.  Well, I 
 &gt;go to look and see a large puddle of oil on the snow and it's pissing
 &gt;out from  somewhere underneath like there is no tomorrow.  SHUT IT OFF, I
 &gt;YELL !  So..I go get dressed and open the garage and start it up and back it 
 &gt;in and it's making like the crankshaft wants to come out and the racket is 
 &gt;deafening or is it my imagination thinking of how expensive a new motor is !  
 &gt;So....I get it in the garage and fill it with oil and start it to see where 
 &gt;the leak is... ya hoo !  Found it, behind the oil filter, so what's this 
 &gt;gizmo behind the oil filter anyway ?  Well, it turns out to be THE OIL 
 &gt;COOLER !,  I didn't know I had an oil cooler !  So I go about taking the
 &gt;oil filter off and finding the nut that holds the oil cooler on and find 
 &gt;out that it's loose.  I decide to tighten it before looking more as it seems 
 &gt;complicated to remove it.  Well, it still leaked so I had to remove the
 &gt;cooler to find the BROKEN O-ring behind.  Whether or not the -35 temp. had 
 &gt;anything to do with this is not sure.  All I know is that the van got started 
 &gt;at -35 without the aid of the blockheater which was plugged in but the
 &gt;DAMN GROUND FAULT DETECTOR detected ground and NO POWER.....THANKS A LOT !
 &gt;After rumaging around in my junk I found an O-ring to fit and got the
 &gt;engine going but was making a loud clacking sound, sure sounded like a rod
 &gt;bearing to me, BUT after some investigation with a srewdriver as a sound
 &gt;probe the noise was detected near the top end of the cylinder under the
 &gt;alternator.  Taking off the valve cover while the engine was running and
 &gt;prying on the rocker arms a bit the noise went away when I did the second
 &gt;rocker in.  COLLAPSED lifter  !  YEA !.  Not a rod bearing  !  Well, the
 &gt;moral of this story is, check your oil cooler and change that O-ring if
 &gt;it's suspect.  Mine was cooked - hard - brittle - so the high oil pressure
 &gt;at - 35 startup blew it, most probable scenario.  I guess I was lucky that
 &gt;the noise was just a collapsed lifter, it COULD have been worse !
 &gt;
 &gt;Cheers,
 &gt;
 &gt;Frank, how long can a Vanagon engine run without oil ?
