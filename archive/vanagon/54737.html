Brian,


At 02:41 PM 1/22/97 +0000, you wrote:

&gt;This can be retro-fitted to any T1 engine, 


So I can go to a scrapyard, find myself a 1600 Transporter, rip out out the
ignition system, and install it in my Bug? Or are there some major snags?


&gt;The 1600 CT Transporter engine was used from 4-'79 to 12-'82, 85.5x69mm,
&gt;1584cc, dono its power output by heart, but around the 50 Din HP the 
&gt;stock 1600 upright engine provided.
&gt;Below a piece of text i copied from a message i wrote to a fellow listie
&gt;a while back, also, i've written about this motor before and i think you 
&gt;find that in the Vanagon_at_Lenti archives.
&gt;Brian.


Thanks for the great piece of info on the 1600 CT Transporter engine.
Apparently, the conversion can be done, but it doesn't seem to be a simple
spanner-and-screwdriver job. I was hoping the end result would look like the
stock 1.6-l. upright Bug engine. I'll try to access the vanagon archives via
e-mail first.


Thanks,
