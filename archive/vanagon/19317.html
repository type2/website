To All:

A hint on hydraulic seals:  If you'll shop around you'll find a kit with
seals to fit virtually every cylinder diameter ever made.  Indeed, they
appear to run in families.  While the master cylinder may have special valves
that must be replaced with identical parts, the slave or wheel cylinders may
often be overhauled with parts that fit but which were never intended for
that specific vehicle.

When a dealer says &quot;They don't make it any more,&quot; it usually means:
  a.  I don't carry it any more, or
  b.  My supplier doesn't stock it any more, or
  c.  I'd really rather $ell you the whole cylinder.

I've successfully rebuilt some very early hydraulic brake systems by
comparing specifications for bore diameter, pressure and so forth.  In each
case I was told the parts were no longer available ( d.  From that
manufacturer :-)

The generic nature of hydraulic seals also applies to O-rings, filters,
fasteners and every type of bearing and bushing.  If you'll take the old part
to the right counter it can usually be cross-referenced to a current part
number and source.  The trick is finding the right counter.  In most large
cities a good place to start is at the oldest independent auto-parts house;
they can usually direct you to specialists (such as Wynn's All-Bearing here
in southern California); the yellow pages are another good source of
Who-To-Call.  

Locating a generic source for certain VW bearings and seals would be of
enormous value to subscribers of this list.  Please keep us posted.
