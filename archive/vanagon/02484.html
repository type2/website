&gt; Ah, the reason that I mentioned is that the state law specifies that a
&gt; police vehicle in this state cannot only legally travel at that speed if
                               ^^^^^^ (let's try &quot;can&quot; instead)
&gt; its emergency lights are on. They were not. So, the state trooper in
&gt; question was as much in violation of the law as I was.  I was tempted to
&gt; pull him over and attempt a &quot;citizen's arrest&quot; but that is really pushing
&gt; my luck. :)

Now I must flame myself for following up to my own posting.
