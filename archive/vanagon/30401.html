Bill,

I asked about these a few months back(on &quot;Another List&quot;) and was told
that they tend to produce too much heat for an Aircooled VW engine.
I don't know what they do to a watercooled engine.

Cheers,

Anyone out there currently using Splitfire Sparkplugs?

I am attempting to increase my fuel efficiency ('83 Westy _at_ 15 mpg
city/hwy), and am considering switching to these along w/a little tinkering
etc.  I have heard these plugs can really make a difference, any proof out
there?

Thanks,
Bill Ernest
