 &gt; Having just spent some time over in rec.autos.vw I must say I am glad that
 &gt; this group is as cordial and responsible as it is.  Some people seem to
 &gt; think the net is for insulting, it's so much easier to rag on somebody when
 &gt; you don't have to meet them.  The line between debate and arguing seems
 &gt; often violated.
