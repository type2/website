&gt;Yuck!  I can't believe they're going to ruin hundreds of old VW buses
&gt;like that!

&gt;They'll probably sell the buses back (or auction) but the buses will be
&gt;torn to crap by the time the Border Patrol gets done with them.
&gt;
&gt;I'm really disgusted by this news.

        Now why the heck cant the BP just buy Mexican busses???!!! Probably
cheaper, and if they *really* want stealth busses, Mexican plates will
really make 'em look innocent. I dunno if the Mex. Government would be cool
with the idea, but it would certainly be worth a shot...
