Subject: Welding heads, installing new valve seats

In a message dated 96-03-05 23:24:02 EST, Ken Hooper asked:

&gt;
&gt;Ever known anybody to weld a head cracked in between the spark plug holes?
&gt;Think I can pull this off?
&gt;

Ken,

Making welded repairs to VW heads is easy as pi...  IF you have the right
tools/skills.

First, get that puppy really clean.  Use walnut shells or other non-abrasive
media.  Now get a cup of water handy.  Using mig or stick, run a bead around
a quarter of the inside of the valve seat.  Run another bead directly
opposite.  Quick like a bunny, throw cold water on the seat.  Assymetric
shrinking pops it right out.  Remove both seats.

Using drills and rotary files, grind out the crack so as to leave a nicely
shaped trench, not too sharp on the bottom.  Make sure the top of the trench
is at least half an inch wide.  If the repair involves the spark plug hole,
and most crack repairs do, hog it out to a generous cone, big side toward the
chamber.  Pop the head in the oven, set to 450.  Go mow the lawn.

Set up your TIG rig same as for welding 356-T0 high strength aluminum
castings.  Filler rod is the same stuff you use for 3003-H3.  I like the
Linde rods best.

Suit up, turn on the water &amp; gas, pull the head out of the oven, get it
positioned and make sure the ground is good.  Sit down, get comfortable and
weld that puppy up.  Build up a nice bead, we'll machine it away later.  Be
careful not to leave any porosities.  I run straight argon, block off the
spark plug hole, plug up the intake &amp; exhaust ports so the gas will pool in
the combustion chamber.  Work in a dam-box if doing a lot of heads.

Punch out the valve guides and press in new ones.  Using the valve guides as
guides, remachine the valve seat spigots.  Remachine the spark plug hole.
 (It's best to use a jig for this.  The valve guides provide a good
reference.)  Put the head back in the oven.  Put the new seats in the
freezer.  Or mebbe not... see below.

You'll need a mandrel to install the seats.  Turn one up out of mild steel.
 You'll need one for each size seat you're doing.   Some guys just tap the
seats into place with a hammer, working it in a little at a time.  If you use
the hammer method, don't bother chilling the seats -- they heat up long
before they are seated.  If you use the mandrel you can usually install the
cold seats into the hot head with a couple of whacks from a 3 lb hammer.
 Make sure the head is firmly supported at the proper angle.  Keep the
seat-end of the mandrel cold.

Make yourself a straking tool that matches the OD of the seats, about 1/8&quot;
beyond the max diameter.  You'll need one for each diameter of seat you plan
to replace.

With the valve seat properly seated and the head very firmly supported, make
repeated passes around the seat with the straking tool, forging the aluminum
firmly against the seat.  Use a ball-end chisel or smooth faced straking tool
to close your tool marks.  Use rotary files to remove any excess welding.
 Polish things up, make them look nice.

Piloting on your newly installed guides, stone the seats as per spec.

Rebuilt head.  Easy as pi.  And don't forget to replace all of the studs.

Personally,  I buy upright rebuilts from Jack Riddle (SIR), Type IV's from
Mark Stevens.  Overhauling just one head is going to take all of the tooling
you'd need to do a thousand heads, plus about ten man-hours, most of which
will be spent setting up the milling machine and tooling.  The wiser course
is to wait until you have a couple of dozen junkers then rebuild them all at
once.  You'll only need to set up your tooling once for each step.  I think
you'll find about two dozen is the minimum practical volume to justify the
tools and set ups.  Even so, each head is going to require about two man
hours, minimum, probably twice that as an average.

Jack Riddle's shop (RIMCO) does heads in batches of 1,000, probably spends no
more than .5 man-hours per head, on average.  Big shop.  Proper tools.
 Correct tooling and the needed skills.  Tough combination to beat.

PS -- the reason you have to pull the seats is because a surface-weld just
won't do.  If the crack propagates under the seat, which it will even if
surface welded, the valve seat will come loose and you're liable to lose the
whole engine when it lets go.   I know -- there are guys out there squirting
a teenie-tiny little bead from a low-buck migger in an ittie-bitty little
grove they've grouged into the top of the crack.  Polish the thing up, it
looks good as new, mebbe even better.  But the crack is still there,
underneath that pretty, polished surface.  And like someone said, &quot;Owl bee
bock.&quot;
