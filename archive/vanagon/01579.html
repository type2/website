Subject: Re:  Getting A Key Cut From The Lock Code - '65 Type II

It is fairly easy to re-key the volkswagen lock cylinders. I use the 
same key on all 4 of my volkswagens. Take the cylinder apart and you will find 
several brass fingers held in place with tiny springs. Move the brass
fingers around until your favorite key works. Do this with all of the
locks on your car(s). BTW, I use to have a couple of Subarus. I keyed
them so that the VW key worked in their locks too.
