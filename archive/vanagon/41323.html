&gt;bolts holding your wheels on;  if you've never taken them off,
&gt;you best look at them soon, at least BEFORE you get a flat on the
&gt;road because ALL of my bolts were put on at the factory bone dry.
&gt;This generally translates to being fused to the hub and if you
&gt;find this out at the beginning of a long awaited trip, you will
&gt;be p-r-e-t-t-y pissed off....

I used to have to use a four-foot cheater to get mine off. Not just dry,
but almost 30 years old. They came off with the most awful creeeeaaaaakkk
sound.

Then I put anti-seize on them.

It still requires the cheater but now they come off with a sound like a
pistol shot. Them suckers BREAK loose. Not only that, but when they bust
loose there's this smell, like when I've been shooting the .45. Smells a
bit like burnt powder. It's ever so much fun. ;)
