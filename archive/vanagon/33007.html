&gt;Hi all
&gt;I am watching a friends Westy ('84 'ish?). For the winter. Any suggestions
&gt;for maintenance besides keeping the tank full and starting it weekly? I am in
&gt;Colorado where it will be kept covered but outside.
&gt;TIA
There's a product made for putting in the gas tank of vehicles that aren't
going to be driven for several months, to keep the gas &quot;fresh&quot; (ie. from
getting gum deposits).  I think it's called Stabilize or something similar.
You put it in the tank, then drive around some to insure it's mixed well, and
some has made it through the carb., FI, etc.  (Note:  This is different from
Gum-Out, specifically for cars going into storage.  Might be made by the same
company, though.)
