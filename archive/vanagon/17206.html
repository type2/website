&gt;
&gt;??? you should have 16 gallons like the rest of us. i get only about 20 mpg
&gt;but i can go for 300-310 miles on the 16 gallons before getting really
&gt;really nervous (usually, i fill up at 250-280 miles).
&gt;
Except for those with Syncros, which have an 18.5 gallon fuel capacity.

Who, OBTW only get 14MPG!!
