Subject: Westy Chest Fridge


Just a comment regarding the chest type refrigerator that came in my 86
Westy Weekender. This was a large black refrigerator chest that was marked
&quot;made in Luxembourg&quot; 
The cigarette lighter plug for 12 volt was in bad shape. I was not able to
find one of the originals. I did buy a heavy duty replacement which lasted
3 days on a trip to Yellowstone before the plastic deformed due to heat
transfer and had to replace it. This thing drew in excess of 7 amps. 
Another problem that I had is on 2-3 occasions that we stopped at Motels
and then when we got to the cabin that we had rented at Yellowstone it was
difficult to carry in from the van to keep things cold on 110 volts. There
was a very narrow little finger grip on each side and being an ammonia
type fridge and loaded with food it was heavy. 
I replaced this with a Coleman thermoelectric chest. This cools and will
also heat food. No moving parts except a fan in the chest. Pulls less than
4 amps and works well. Lightweight and has large handles so no problem to
take it into a motel room, etc. Uses a transformer when on 110 to convert
to 12 volts for use in a room. I think it is a big improvement and inside
space is very close to the same. My old unit now sits in my son-in-laws
family room as a spare beer cooler and for that purpose it is fine.
