&gt;  I think Thom is right...in a sense. But, what if you want to or do own
&gt; several vehicles to include aircooled VW's? Pay $25 +$25 and on and on..get
&gt; the picture? I own 4 vehicles at this point in time and trying to get
&gt; another (VW air, of course). I wouldn't mind having many models included in
&gt; the CD-ROM. No flames, please! Just a point to ponder.

Well, its really  not much different than having to buy a manual for your 
Jeep, one for your Yugo, and another for your Skoda.  (*Pause for dry heaving*)

There are actually several models on a disk; you get a license key to &quot;unlock&quot;
certain ones, unless you work there and get one for free :)
