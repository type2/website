&gt;I just got this '86 Westfalia GL Syncro.  A lot of little thing were wrong
&gt;with it and I am having them fixed.  No big deal.
&gt;
&gt;When I bought it the rear differential lock did not work.  I talked to a
&gt;couple of mechanics and they told me that it is common for the servos to go
&gt;bad and should be no problem to fix.
&gt;
&gt;Well the shop, which charges $70 per hour, has spent two hours and can only
&gt;tell me that it is not the servo and that some thing is stuck.  They say
that
&gt;they will have to tear open the transmission and have no idea what they will
&gt;find.  They recommend that I drive without fixing.  That I will only need it
&gt;if I get stuck and that the 4-WD works great.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody out there ever use there rear differential lock?  How much would it
&gt;cost to replace the whole tranny?
&gt;
&gt;
Craig,
I have used the diff lock routinely when off-roading.  If you live in an area
where you get a lot of snow / ice or plan on off-roading the diff lock could
make quite a difference.  Pickup and SUV owners that want a diff lock
typically pay $600 to $1,000 (depending on variety) to have one installed.
 I'd get a second opinion before having the transmission opened.
