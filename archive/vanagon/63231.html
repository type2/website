Subject:      bus for sale: 80 camper, Tuscaloosa, AL

well, there's this 1980 (air-cooled) Camper L (got the stove, fridge, and
sink) out here for sale near my house. it's at a dealer, but the guy says
it's his roommate's friend's bus. :)

it's a 1980, pop-top Camper L.  gold in color, white top. 74,000 miles on
it. he's asking $4500.

it's in Cottondale, AL (which is actually Tuscaloosa, AL). the place is
called Zyx B. Auto Sale (don't ask me how to pronounce it). their phone
number is (205) 556-9447.

if anybody needs me to look at it, let me know. :)

joel
