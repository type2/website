Subject: what motor parts interchange???

hi all yet another question

i just picked up a 1900cc motor for my terrorist van for 100.00. from what i
understand i have a 2100cc in my 86 vanagon with digifant set up.  im
familiar with the aircooled vw but not yet with the vanagon. 

my questions are what is interchangable between the two motor? as far as
heads,pistons,altenator,water pump,flywheel,rocker arms,valves,oil
pump,lifters, etc. im not to worried about the bolt on stuff cause i will be
still using digifant.i know the the 2100cc has a longer stroke, but are the
rods and journals the same. is the exahaust the same between the 2? this
will end the questions for now but for 100.00 i felt that i couldnt go
wrong. or did i? 

thanks Jonce
