On Mon, 18 Aug 1997 12:34:55 -0500 you said:
&gt;I found a large puddle of water on the driver's side floor mat of my '84
&gt;Westy this morning.  Having had heavy rain the night before, I checked all
&gt;the windows, they were all closed.  I did notice a small amount of water
&gt;collecting on the dash next to the lower left hand side of the windshield.
&gt;The water seems to have come from under the seal.  The Windshield seal is in

yup. it's dripping down behind the fuse box. what usually happens is that
the seal drys out over the years (even though it LOOKS ok) and pulls away
from the metal body. get some 3M Heavy Duty Drip Chek (blue box) and a
plastic bondo-spreader-thingie (do NOT use metal!). stick the plastic
spreader-thingie between the seal and the body and pry up a bit, and squeeze
the Drip Chek into the cavity between the seal and the body. it'll seal the
gap. you may have to do it all round the entire windshield ... :( cause it's
hard to tell exactly where the water is getting under the seal.

oh, and get some General Purpose Adhesive Remover (to clean up the ooze that
get out from under the seal). :) it leaves a whitish glaze/film, but that
cleans up with water.

yes, you can use silicon seal, but it's much harder to clean up the slop.
