Subject: Seattle Area Mechanics (Watercooled)

I would appreciate any suggestions from my venerable Seattle area Vanagon
brethern for reliable, capable and economical Seattle (preferably north
Seattle) VW repair shops specializing in watercooled Vanagons.  I've been
using Carter VW since I bought my '91 Westy from them 6 years ago, and
while I've found them to be superlative in the reliable and capable
departments - and even though they've given me the occassional break on a
service charge - between flat rate and $65/hr shop rates, they're still
pretty pricey.  

So I feel it's time to start beating the bushes for a shop that can offer 
quality, VW trained mechanics and doesn't have the overheads of a dealer 
operation.  I know there used to be a few around - Hermann's in the U. 
District (no longer handles VW) and Akers on Capital Hill (air-cooled 
only), and assume there still are.  I'm just a little out-of-touch on the 
local scene now and would appreciate some advice.  

TIA.
