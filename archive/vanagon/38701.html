Subject: Front brake things..


Hi,
	I'm writing to you a little discouraged. After
having brought my Westy to Switzerland from Canada with
high hopes of touring Europe in the next few years, I
find out that Switzerland has ridiculously high standards
for having a car on the road, and that the total of
the necessary repairs on the van (like changing the
windshield because of a tiny star that's been there 3
years) may be more than the vehicle is worth..

	Nevertheless, I don't have to register it in 
Switzerland for another 2 months and I have friends coming
to visit from Canada, .. and my brakes are shot. The mechanic
explained to me that the problem is with the front brakes.
The &quot;things&quot; that squeeze the brake pads onto the disks
apparently block in a closed position causing the brakes
to get very hot and to loose braking action. He recommended
that I change these myself because it would cost way too
much for him to do it (like $1000).

	I tried using the gopher archive just now, but had
no success in viewing old articles (is something wrong with
it or with me?) Can someone tell me if there has been 
postings about this before, whether it's a common problem,
the procedure to follow, etc.? I have to do this this week,
because my friends are arriving Saturday. I was supposed 
to pick them up in Paris, I'll have to buy them train tickets..

	Oh, I should change the cylinders on the rear brakes
as well, but that is apparently not quite as urgent. However,
if you know of some information on changing those, I would
appreciate it too.

Thanks for your help!
