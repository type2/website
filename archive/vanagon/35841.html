Now for the test ride. What a difference!!! The van doesn't dip when you
hit the brakes, entrance ramps don't create that tipping over feeling
and bumps are smoother. Well worth the investment. I got my KYB's from
a FL(foreign)APS and paid $88 for the front pair, and $90 for the rear
pair. KYB's are a gas assist shock and have a life time guarantee.

gas pressure shocks are definently an upgrade from stock.
i'm saving up for a set of bilsteins for my crewcab...
they list for $109 per shock for heavy duty valving
which is the only setting they make for vanagons.
can't wait...
