Subject: Muffler time for '66


Yes indeed, its muffler time.  Blew a HUGE hole thru the muffler...might
have been while off-roading up north (north meaning 3 hrs from Hudsons Bay
in Ontario).

I was looking thru the rags, and the is a veritible bonanza of different types
of mufflers out there.  An I haven't even checked anything locally yet.

My bus currently has a stock bug muffler (with cutouts in the bumper to 
accomodate it; damn PO).  

A guide to what the different mufflers do would be much appreciated:

Specifically, what is a:

Monza  (other than 4 tail pipes and yellow)
Quiet pack  (is this actually quieter?)
Dual Quiet Pack (Twice as quiet:-)
Stock (I had no problems with the one that was on there, other than the cutouts)

What are the relative benefits, pros, cons, etc?

Thanks,
...Markus
