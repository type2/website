&gt; OK. UGH! I guess I'll get the 1500 watt model. 

&gt; YOU GUYS! Convincing me to pay up for a monster thing.

Hey, it's still pretty cheap as inverters go.  And if you ever need to
sell it or trade down, I may be interested.  :)

&gt; Anyway, I think I will mount it in the pantry under the sink and then I only
&gt; have to make a 1 foot run of 2 gague wire to the hot side of the battery
&gt; behind/underneath the driver. 

Sounds like a good idea.

&gt; I wonder if I should mount a third battery in the tray on the outside wall
&gt; of the vehicle to the left of the engine.

Sounds like another good idea, but it's kind of far away, no?
 
&gt; Then, of course, I have to select a tiny microwave. What gives on this front
&gt; David?

Lots.  Microwaves don't run as well on inverters as they do on house
current.  That's because of the nature of the power the inverters
produce, I think.  I only measure about 85-90 volts from my inverter.
Someone more in the know can tell you why, but it has to do with the
wave form.  Definately get a microwave with a carousel.  The motor draws 
next to nothing and it will cook more evenly.  The light, however,
should either be disconnected or swapped for a DC model to save inverter
power.

Microwaves are usually advertised with their cooking power, not their
actual consumption in watts.  I went to look at a 550 watt microwave, a
little bitty thing, that drew 8.5 amps through my little meter when I
turned it on.  That's almost 1000 watts, folks.  I finally found a Sharp
carousel microwave &quot;Mighty Mite&quot; or somethine like that, that was listed
as 400 watts cooking power and consumed 4.8 amps.  After disconnecting
the light, I found that it runs okay on the 600 watt inverter if the
voltage supplied to the inverter stays near 12.  It does take a little
longer to heat food than a normal microwave, though.  Running the engine
while using the microwave really helped a lot.  If you get the bigger
inverter I would still get a smaller microwave, but don't buy anything
until you test the power that it draws, or you may be in for a letdown.
