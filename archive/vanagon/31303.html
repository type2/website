Subject: 80 vanagon heat duct

&gt;        I have a quick question for some of the air-cooled experts out
&gt;there. I am missing the heat ducting elbow that extends from the heater
&gt;blower down thru the sheet metal fitting into the right heat exchanger.
&gt;This is an 80 Vanagon bye the bye.  Don't ask me how i lost it, but
&gt;my question is can I drive without it?  ...

Well, assuming you mean the pipe that directly connects to the heat exchanger -
 I drove around without my left one for who knows how long - 3 or 4 months
at most. I finally noticed it when I was changing the oil. Had to order a
replacement from VW. IN fact I still have a printout of the parts in front
of me:

diagram #37
piece #17 - name: heater pipe, right; VW part # 070 256 331

It seems to be safe to go without it - you shouldn't be sucking any exhaust
fumes into the cabin - at least mine wasn't.
