Subject: useful web search engine


Perhaps many of you already know of this site, but I was just
clued into it, and was so impressed, I felt like sharing  :)

It's:  http://www.altavista.digital_dot_com

and is apparently the largest web index ever.  A search for
the word &quot;vanagon&quot; alone, for example, yielded 400 matches,
and that was w/o including search of usenet.  Many of the searches
I ran on this page made results from yahoo and webcrawler pale
in comparison.

FWIW
