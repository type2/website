thanks, ron.
trans mount looks ok, motor mounts are dry rotted/cracked, but a local
mechanic confirmed that they appear to be doing their job.  belt is there,
i'll check tension when i get home.  the frequency of the chirping appears
to be commensurate with the rate of acceleration/rpms.  if i let off the
gas, the chirping goes away, if i step on it it goes faster with the engine.
