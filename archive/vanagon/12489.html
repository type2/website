Subject:      Re: Puddles inside the bus

Hi all, new subscriber here. I need to get all the window
seal replaced (and some body work done) on my '66 bus.
Sigh, I know it's gonna cost me...does anyone have tips on
where to get the seals cheap? I've found a good, reasonably
priced body shop to do the work.

Thanks!  Lisa Mazak
