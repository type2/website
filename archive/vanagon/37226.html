Subject: Re: 83 westy where to place bikes?

This may not pertain to your van. But I've got a '72 westy and it has big 
rain gutters. The previous owner had drilled four holes in the rear rain 
gutter and mounted two &quot;Bike Tights&quot; to them. The bikes attach at the 
forks and sit vertically. It works pretty good.

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; Having a fetish for expensive mountain bikes, I was wondering where all 
&gt; the other van/bike kooks place their bikes.  I was told that I can only 
&gt; carry 2 scooters on the roof.  Personally, I am in no hurry to cut holes 
&gt; into my fiberglass.  Someone else told me to place the bikes off the 
&gt; front.  I don't think the road crud would mix well with my bearings.  I 
&gt; would really like to place them inside somehow.  Any cool/cheap mounting 
&gt; methods without taking up the rear seat?  Input appreciated!
