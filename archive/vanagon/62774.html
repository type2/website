&gt; Martin,
&gt; 
&gt; I'n not sure what a Vanagon TD is.  I have an '85 Westi water cooled.
&gt; Would these plans apply to it?
&gt; 

No, this is for the inline 4 diesel turbo. Drawings on my page are for 
the 1.6l, but the manifolds reportedly work with the 1.9l. There is a 
lot of diesel tuning going on in Europe. (I hear of turbos, intercooler, 
cams, gas flowed head (whatever that is) etc.) People get even the small 
1.6's to over 100hp. VW motorsport recently tuned the 1.9 TDI to 170hp 
with no drop in fuel economy.

Sorry, not much resemblance with the wasserboxer you have.

/Martin
