&gt; I've seen references to using the O2 sensor present in some Wasserboxer
&gt; vans to adjust the fuel mix, or CO level, or whatever. As my '86 Digijet
&gt; Caravelle doesn't have one of those sensors, I'm thinking of using an
&gt; external one.

I know the earlier air-cooled L-Jetronic came in both &quot;O2 sensor&quot; and
&quot;Non-O2 sensor&quot; flavors, but I thought all the Digijets had them.  Are
you sure you don't?  Looking at the &quot;Technical data and specifications&quot;
page of my Bently it talks about the O2 sensor for the Digijet, and it
doesn't specify &quot;California only.&quot;

&gt; 1:st question: Which kind should I use? I can easily get one-wire,
&gt; three-wire and four-wire sensors. I suppose the ones with three or four
&gt; wires have some kind of heating element in them.

3-wire (I have no idea what the 4th wire in a 4-wire sensor does) since
it uses 2 wires for heating and one wire for signaling the ECU.


&gt; 2:nd question: Where should I put it?

It needs to be in front of the catalytic converter, as close to the
combined exhaust as possible, in an air-tight port.  You're talking
welding here.

&gt;
&gt; 3:rd question: How should I connect it, and how to interpret measurements?
&gt;

Signal wire connected to voltmeter.  On a fully warmed-up car, properly
timed, proper idle setting, etc. voltage should be around .5 volts.  Low
volts is lean, high volts is rich.
