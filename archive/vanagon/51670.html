Subject: Re: '83.5 wasserboxer idling strange

&gt;As the subject says, my bus is idling strange, whether warm or cold. It's
&gt;almost like you lightly touch the gas pedal every second or so. The
&gt;rev/idle is very consistent and rhythmic. It doesn't seem to effect the
&gt;drivability at all and doesn't stall when idling for extended periods, say
&gt;10 minutes.
&gt;
I've experienced the same behaviour on my '87 when the throttle switch
didn't close at idle. Try sharply tapping on the accelerator when it's
behaving like this. On my van this is enough to close the switch and it
begins to idle properly. I haven't yet gotten around to lubricating the
throttle plate which I think is sticking sometimes causing the switch to
remain open.
