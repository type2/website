Hey man heard you were looking for a synchro.
I've attached a message posted over a week ago regarding a synchro for   
sale.  I stopped by this place over the weekend and the 86 is sold but he   
has an 87 and 91 still for sale.  I only had a chance to look at the 87   
and it looked nice.  No body rust and everything else pretty good.   
 Didn't drive it because a foot problem prevents me from effectively   
pressing the clutch pedal.

I live in Albany, NY and I am about 1.5-2 hours away from the shop.  The   
town is also about 30 miles from Concord NH.
I can drive you there if you like or you can fly out to Concord, if it's   
even possible.
