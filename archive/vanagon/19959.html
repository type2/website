Subject: TYP I&amp;II ENG. different??
Date: Wed, 21 Jun 1995 02:50:00 GMT


What's the difference in ENGINES between a TYPE I and TYPE II. They look 
pretty much the same to me, but it looks like, from the ads saying &quot;put
a beetle engine in your type II&quot; that there must be some differences in
the engine mounts, to say the least.

Were there any, other, internal differences to help the engine hold up better
under the load of all that frontal area and extra weight? 

Anyone speak to the wisdom/expense/hassle of sticking a TYPE I in a '71 bus?

Is there any price difference in TYPE I and TYPE II longblocks? If so, why?

Thanks in advance.
