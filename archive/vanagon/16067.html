Hey!  I'm new to the list...  I've kinda' been lurking in the shadows but 
thought I might be able to help on this one.

I've got a 12V motor ('67?) in my '62 Double Cab.  Taking it out is a 
piece of cake.

Muir sez, &quot;replace the brushes, sandpaper the commutator and clean the 
grooves&quot;

-or-

&quot;install a new motor&quot; 8-)

I've had pretty good luck getting these things rebuild by my local motor 
(electric -- non-VW) shop... pretty cheap too!!!

Good luck,
