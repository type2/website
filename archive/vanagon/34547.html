Subject: Frozen manual trans

Hi,

It has been cold here in Eastern PA.  The last few mornings I have had problems
shifting my manual trans., it gets beeter after it warms up for a while.
  So yesterday I spent the day cleaning up the garage
so I could fit the Van in.  After it sat in the garage for an hour, the shifting
was back to normal.

What should I do to make the tansmission more tolerant to the cold?

I was thinking about changing the fluid by going to one of those one hour
places.  

What is your opinion on the &quot;Jiffy Lube&quot; shops and the qaulity of their
fluids and services, and should I do it myself.

One question that gives you isight into my ignorance:  Is there a dipstick
or some resevoir I can look into to make sure I have enough trans fluid?

Please respond to me directly at jferree_at_pica.army_dot_mil.

thanks for your time.
