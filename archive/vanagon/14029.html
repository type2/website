Please put on me the list of those that would love to purchase
a well made replacement for the over priced frisbees the dealer
wants &gt;$20 for.

While we're on the topic of needed plastic bits, what with the
weather getting warmer and all, it's time to find replacements
for the water tank and sink screw plugs for my 81 Westy.  Anyone
have any ideas on where they can be gotten used or less than
dealer cost?

Appreciate any help as my plastic and screw clamp solution just
aint cuttin' it.

Thanks,
Jack
