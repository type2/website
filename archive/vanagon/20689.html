Subject:  wierd dash outlet on 84 westy

a friend who is helping me get mechanically aquainted with my new 81
has an 84 with a strange power outlet in the dash to the right of the
lighter.  in the archives, several mentions were made of older busses
which had something like this.  is it just a 12v outlet of a different size like
the older ones, or is it something else?  thanks in advance.

matthew.                                 goikem_at_state.mi_dot_us
