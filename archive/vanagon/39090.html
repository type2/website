Subject: Paul's starter problems
Date: Fri, 5 Apr 96 11:52:53 EST

Hey all,
Paul is now convinced that his non-start problem is due to the ignition
switch.  Soooo, he wants advice from you folks about setting up a toggle
switch so that he doesn't have to go through the painful procedure for
replacing the ignition switch on a '79 bus.  Basically, he wants to know
what wires need connecting to the toggle switch so it'll work properly.

He also wants you to respond to the list because I think he will be
making a trip in to check his e-mail later.

So, anybody who has done this, help Paul! :)

Paul thanks you in advance,
Sean
