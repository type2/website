Hey Now

I'm looking for some advice or input from someone who has had the same
problem as me.  I've a '77 Westy, full of electrical gizmos where I'm
sure that some good old VW mechanical gizmo would've done just swell.

My windshield washer pump seems inadequate (not to mention that the PO
scavenged the power line to re-wire the horn; don't ask).  I filled the
windshield washer reservoir, hooked the power up to the pump, it
whirred like mad, and a wildly powerful stream .5 cm tall came out the
drivers side nozzle.  Really underwhelming.

Any recommendations for this seemed-to-be-working pump, or should I
break down and spend $10 at the FLAPS for a new one?  (Also, there's a
pump input so I can pressurize the reservoir - should I just carry a

	TIA

bicycle pump?)
