Yet?  Like they're gonna make one now after the Wasserboxer's been out of the
showrooms for 4 years.  Don't hold your breath!  :-)

O.K. I'm thinking of writing a maintenance manual for Wasserboxers.  When I
say maintenance, I mean, all the routine stuff that an owner might perform
for him(her)self.  Not tranny rebuilds &amp; the like, just the stuff that should
be done before something breaks.  All ot these things seem to be lacking from
the Bentley. Would anyone be interested?
