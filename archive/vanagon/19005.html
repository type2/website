&gt; &gt;Buy a EuroVan ;)  We already got that engine....
&gt; 
&gt; Bill , have you ever driven a Eurovan?

Daily.
 
&gt; I have.  God, I HATED it!  That 5-cylinder engine right up front there 
&gt; really growls in your ears so loudly it's hard to have a conversation.  The 
&gt; one I drove, a Winnebago conversion, didn't feel any quicker, any more 
&gt; responsive or any nimbler than my '86 Westie.  But it sure was LOUD!

Noisy?  First complaint I've ever heard about a EV being noisy.  We get 
noise from the A/C but not awhole lot of engine noise.  The Winnebago 
conversion - I'm assuming you mean the one sold at VW dealers not the 
Rialta sold at Winnebago dealers is a full foot maybe two longer than the 
'regular' EV.  The EV is almost assuredly nimbler than the Vanagon.  A 
longer test drive might have shown that to you.
 
&gt; I'm VERY disappointed.  My Westie is getting (how shall I say?) a bit long 
&gt; in the tooth now.  I like a QUIET car, and the Vanagon is one.  The Eurovan 
&gt; is decidedly not.

If you don't like one don't buy one.  I did like it I did buy it. I'd do 
it again.
