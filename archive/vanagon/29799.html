just a general comment on fuel tanks... 

West Marine(800-538-0775 and they send great free catalogs), as well
as other marine suppliers have a nice array of aux fuel tanks in both
5052 aluminum alloy and marine grade plastic.  might have something
that fits.  also have switching valves for tying two tanks together.
