&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to check out a 76 camper on Friday, and the owner
&gt; tells me that the canvas is gone from it.  Being new to buses
&gt; and campers, I assume that this is just the exterior sheath
&gt; to the pop top, but I wasn't completely sure what he was
&gt; describing.  Anyway, can anyone give me an idea of what it
&gt; might cost to get a replacement, mail-order or otherwise?

The 'canvas' IS the tent part of the pop-top.  There is only one layer: 
there is no interior/exterior to it.  If the tent is shot, check that the 
top bunk is ok (not grotty, mildewed, smelly, gross, yeck, etc.).  Check 
also that the rubber seals for where the pop-top meets the roof of the 
van when the pop-top is closed are in good shape (and that they're there!).

&gt;From my most recent JC Witless catalog, replacement canvas run about 
$260.00 US, pop-top seals another $100.00 US.  I don't have RMMW or MCW 
catalogs, so maybe someone else can help you there.

BTW, WHY is the canvas gone?  Was it, say, stored in a damp, dingy garage 
for the last six years?  Alarm bells!  Ding!  Ding!  Ding!  Check it out.

&gt; It sounds like a pretty sound car otherwise (recent rebuild, 
&gt; lots of other recent work), but I want to know beforehand what
&gt; I am getting myself into.

Well, be sure to go through St. Muir's &quot;How to buy a Volkswagen&quot; 
procedure.  Especially the meditation part.

Happy camping!

Tobin
