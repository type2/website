&gt; &gt; Have recently been reconnected to University e-mail.  It is becoming
&gt; &gt; difficult to handle amount of mail coming from vanagon list.  Don't want
&gt; &gt; to unsubscribe.  What options are there for managing volume of mail?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Tell your system administrator at the University that all non-VW related
&gt; data is irrelavent and that only VW data is to be allowed in.  Filter
&gt; out the rest.  Resistance is futile!  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Or.... you can change to digest mode...
