Subject:      Norcold Altitude Kit

Dear Volks (EVC especially),

The Norcold kit took about four hours to replace this first time.  He
thought it would be faster (three hours) on the next one.  Before it left
the garage floor I had them check my procedure for lighting the thing.
Noted that the van was nicely leveled.  Flame was lighted better than
average...took about 20 seconds to get a clear green signal light showing
&quot;okay, it's lit!&quot;

They did remind me to follow the intructions about keeping it close to
level.  The extra vent doesn't offend the eye.

BTW, saw my first '97 EVC headed toward me in Waterville, Maine but  could
not stop to do hello's.  Was passed by a nice burgundy-colored Vanagon Westy
on I -95; the couple inside waved as they sailed by.  I was on cruise
enjoying the beginning of fall foliage and they were headed north to the
real woods.

Never in a hurry, Gary
