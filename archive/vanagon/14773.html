Subject: Re: Vanagon Prices

 He also has two or three other vans for sale and I will
&gt;get the specs/prices etc. if anyone wants.  I'd post his 800 number, but
&gt;I'm not sure if there is a policy about ~commercial advertising on the
&gt;list. ???


Sounds OK to me, not much info in the N.East area. Any excuse to drop into 
Ben and Jerry Land most welcome, especially concerning Vanagons. TIA tim s.
