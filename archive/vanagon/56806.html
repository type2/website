Kenyon,

After I read about the 96 &quot;Summit&quot; at VWoA last year along with the picture
or two of the new Eurovan I really felt VW was going to bring the EV to the
US again and hoped that the Weekender Westy and Westy Camper may come in as
well.  At this point in time I really feel that VW has taken themselves out
of the US van market and I dont have much hope that they will every get
back into it unless its with some totally different model like a Sharan or
something that will fit one of their basic chassis designs which would make
it more &quot;American&quot;.

Tim

&gt;
&gt;SO . . . what can WE do to let VW know that many of us are - or will be VERY
&gt;INTERESTED in the Westfalia version of the Eurovan? Can't they at least allow
&gt;REAL SERIOUS VW owners to purchase one in Germany for use there and shipment
&gt;back to the US? If they would AT LEAST reinstate the &quot;tourist program&quot; with
&gt;the necessary details for import by the individual to the US, they might see
&gt;that there are SOME REALLY SERIOUS VW types willing to pay a fair price for
&gt;a quality vehicle.
