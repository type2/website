Subject: Parting 63 super beetle


A friend of mine is looking to part out his beetle, he picked it up for 
free and was working on it, when he found out the floor was bad, he wants 
to part it out for $$ for his 71 Bus resto. Things like dash and glass 
are good. We can ship or come find us in Southern Maryland.
