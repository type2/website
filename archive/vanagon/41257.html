&gt;&gt;&gt;I'll be bring Transporter Ale ... albeit without labels....my supplier
&gt;&gt;&gt;never came thru....                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'd say that a list sticker, appropriately positioned on each bottle,
&gt;&gt; would be all the label anyone would ever want.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; They're even shaped right!   :^)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (pssst... hey, Rich, how about a commission?)    :^)
&gt;
&gt;Ooh, a free sticker with every bottle! What a great way to sell stickers.

Who said &quot;free&quot;?

&gt;Hmmm, except *nobody* around here drinks beer, do they???   :)

Nope. Some of us inhale it.  ;^)
