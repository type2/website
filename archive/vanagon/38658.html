Thanks for the info.  Now, what head/gasket problem are you referring
to?  I must not have the problem (or it has already been dealt with by
the PO) as I have put around 40,000 miles on the Vanagon myself and it
dosn't leak fluids.  Well, that is until yesterday when the hose going
to the overflow bottle decided that it needed replacing.

Again,
Thanks
