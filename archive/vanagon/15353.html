Subject: Testing Generator and Volt. Reg.

Helpers;
    Ric has graciously lent me a Volt Meter (thx, Ric!) so that I might test
out my generator and voltage regulator, but alas! I know not how to use it!!!
I looked it up in J.Muir's book, but it is still not entirely clear, and
since I am using someone else's tool, I wanna make sure before I blow us all
up!!
    My red GEN light came on and now stays on all the time. She runs
normally, but the light beckons......is it true I will have to remove the
entire engine if the gen. is kapoot??(('71 Camper) My volt. reg. is behind my
air cleaner for some reason....Any suggestions would be helpful : D
  TIA-Rachel
