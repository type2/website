I have a 1991 vanagen with 110,000 miles on it.  I have just experienced 
my third blown head gasket.  I feel as thou its a lemon.  I want to keep 
the van but get rid of the engine.  I've heard that a volvo engine will 
replace what I have in there now.  Do you have any info if this is 
correct or not?
