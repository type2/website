Subject: Alternators, the cold and The Idiot Factor

Vanamaniacs,

Well, after getting the bearing for the alternator last week I fanally
decided that it was time to do something about it.  I think the deciding
factor was that with a hole in the exhaust I could not hear it for the noise
from the alternator.  I got it out ok but when I started to take it apart I
saw that the bearing at the slip ring end had seazed and tried to tak part of
the housing with.  So that meant a trip to the FLAPS for a rebuilt which
suprisingly was in stock!  So now I have a new set of alternator bearings
that I need to do something with.  The rebuilt does not have exactly the same
electrical connections the old one did which the FLAPS people said I should
cut and splice to fit.  I hate to cut and splice any wire if I don't have to
so I didn't.  I made an &quot;transition wire&quot;.  One connector on one end the
other on the other.  Works good so far.

The Cold.  You've heard don't work when you're tired, frustrated, don't
really want to do it, etc.  I want to add another, and I'll bet Bob Hoover
would agree, don't work when you are cold.  I managed to get my small
kerosene heater heated garage up to about 25 degrees but the Westy is in
there, the Syncro is outside where, when I started, it was 9 degrees.  It was
1 when I finished (-15 windchill).  Things just don't go right when it's like
that.

The Idiot Factor.  When you take an old part to be exchanged make sure that
you have all the nuts and bolts off.  Two trips for me; one to get the
alternator, two to get the adjustment bolt.

Well, out for now.
