&gt;I need the brass ring on the back of the steering wheel.  This
&gt;ring allows the horn to work.  Mine wore out.  On certain models
&gt;of steering wheels, the brass ring is easily removed by removing the
&gt;black part it is attached to in the center.  I will check on the procedure
&gt;if some one would like.

I beleive this part is still available at the dealer.
