Subject: Re: bash at martha's

&gt;OK, it's official:  the &quot;bash&quot; at my place is happening on Saturday,
&gt;March 19th, beginning at 5 p.m and going thru as late as any of
&gt;you like.  Below are people who indicated an interest in attending;
&gt;please confirm so I can plan the food amounts, and anyone else wishing
&gt;to attend, you're welcome, too!  I plan to make pasta to feed everyone,
&gt;and will supply coffee.  Guess the rest can be potluck - let me know!
&gt;
where are you located?
