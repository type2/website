Subject: '87 westy surging ?
Date: Tue, 23 May 1995 05:45:07 -0400 (EDT)

My wasserboxer motor is surging at idle.  I think I remember reading about
this problem on the list before so I will try the archives.  Meanwhile if
any of you have a clue as to what is happening the help would be welcome. 
The symtoms are constant surging between 900 and 1200 rpm after hot and at
at idle.  When driving all seems fine.  I have run some fuel injector
cleaner through a tank of gas and that had no effect.  Could there be
an air leak somewhere ?  Hoping for a simple solution  (:-)

Cheers

Frank
