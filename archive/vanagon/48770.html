:	Getting bubbles out of cooling system

About a month, someone left an excellent, specific procedure to get the
bubbles out of Vanagon water-cooled systems. Unforturnately, I have =
misplaced
them.

I have an '84 Camper, and when I have gone through the official owner's
manual by lifting the front end up, etc, I still have air in the system. =
It
appeared that bubbles would come out of the radiator bleeder for s short
time, then totally stop doing anything, then occasionally bubble up, =
then
stop, etc. It seemed erratic and unproductive, with then end result of =
about
a 1.5 inch bubble in the master tank by the engine.

Does anyone have a specific way to purge this darned system?

The instructions that I got from a VW expert were as follows:
Lift the BACK end of the van as high as possible.
Rev the engine to over 2000rpm and keep topping up the expansion tank =
until all air is evacuated.
Replace lid, drop engine revs to normal, lower back end of vehicle.
It worked well on my *83 Caravelle.
