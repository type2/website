Subject: Re: Westy roof drains

There's a gap between the top of the vehicle and the rear edge of the
luggage carrier that allows water to escape. From there it slips by the
seals where the pop top meets the luggage carrier. 

&gt;1. How is rain water from the luggage carrier supposed to drain? I see 
&gt;five holes that appear to just go to the metal roof of the van. Does the 
&gt;water just seep out around the gasket?
