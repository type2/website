Subject: Drink up, the price of VW fluids!

Latest atrocity in VW pricing, power steering fluid, $27.95/litre, $34 after 
taxes.  Hell this makes Autobahn coolant look like a bargain.  Bought a 
litre of PS fluid for top up and future flushing.  Supposed to be the stuff 
that 're-inflates' the rubber seals and bits in the system.  We'll see.  
Anyone know how many litres it takes for a flush?  Tim Smith
