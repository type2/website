Subject: Re: Nine Seater Vanagon?

Are you asking if there were 9 passanger Vanagons?  If that is your
question, the answer is YES.  My folks bought one back in '83, the first
year of the wasserboxer.  We still have it.   There must be others out
there.

&gt;He was wondering if it was possible to get a vanagon with nine seats.
&gt;I think not in the US market, but what about Europe or Canada?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
