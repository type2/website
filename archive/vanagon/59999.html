I think that the coolant is evaporating/&quot;burping&quot; out of the resevoir. 
Something to do with:
the position of the resevoir over the muffler
hot driving conditions
maybe a bad hose between expansion tank and resevoir

if you look at the resevoir quickly after a hot drive you might be able 
to see and hear some burping or some coolant stains on the muffler.


take all of this advice with a grain of salt - my experience comes from a 
diesel and jette engined westy.
