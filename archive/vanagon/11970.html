&gt;This feat has yet to be repeated but i wanted to share the 
&gt;preliminary incredulation with y'all.  If this was a one-time fluke 
&gt;(or error) I'll fess up to everyone (yeah, right).
&gt;
&gt;The sensor on my van is going to be replaced just for the heck of it!

And Dan, I'll believe it when I hear it from you.  Anything that will get my
van past it's dismal 16 mpg range, I'll try (within reason).
