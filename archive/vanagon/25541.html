Excerpts from audi: 26-Sep-95 Re: BUSES, VALUE, &amp; RESALE by &quot;Mike
White&quot;_at_law.utah.ed 
&gt; When I went to get insurance on my '57, I had to give the insurance 
&gt; company pictures, because I wanted it insured for $5000.  Of course 
&gt; my premiums are a good deal more than yours.  About $80 a month.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I think it is time to start a class-action suit against all 
&gt; insurance companies for sexual and age discrimination.  My rates are 
&gt; higher soley because I am a male, and am under 25.  Basing my rates 
&gt; on others of the same sex, soley because they are of the same sex is 
&gt; very descriminatory.  But that doesn't apply to the insurance 
&gt; industry, right!?  &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You know, we might have a remote chance on the sexual discrimination 
&gt; part, but I don't think the world is recognizing age descrimination 
&gt; as un-PC yet...
&gt; 
When I went to my insurance agent to ask about insuring my '69
Squareback(before I took it apart into a zillion pieces), I was upset
because the premium was going to be about $600 per year for State
Minimum Liability only coverage.  Then she tried told me that I really
wanted more than the state minimum coverage because it's very easy for
an accident (vehicle damage/medical payments/property damage) to
approach a 6(or even 7) digit dollar value.  Then she told me how much
it would cost if I was female/married/over 40/without any speeding
tickets.  I believe it was around $200 for the same coverage.  Anyways,
I suggested that I would be willing to pay more for car insurance
because males tend to get in more accidents as soon as she started to
charge me less for health insurance than a comprobably female.  I
suggested that males should pay less for health insurance because they
can't get pregnant.  

I never did buy the car insurance.  The car is sitting under a tarp in a
friend's back yard awaiting rustoration.  I never bought the health
insurance either.  I'm back in school,so I'm covered under my parents
policy until I'm 23 or something.
