Subject:      fumble fingers strikes again: correction to vw parts numbering
 system

way down at the bottom, it should read:

... that is, an air-cooled vanagon 4-speed has a 091 transmission, and
parts for that transmission would start with 091.  a vanagon syncro
transmission is an 094, and its parts (but only those SPECIFIC to the
Syncro) would start with 094. any 094 parts that are common to the 091
                         ***
would start with 091.
