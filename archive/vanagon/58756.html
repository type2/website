Hi,

I used the Wal-Mart bought &quot;Super H20 Sun Shower II&quot; last week.  The
hose isn't long enough to reach the sink from the luggage rack.  Even
in the southwestern desert, it takes a long time for the water in the
bag to heat up enough to take a pleasant shower; several hours at
least, all morning and early afternoon is best.  A shower lasts only a
few minutes with the bag full of water.  When the sun starts to go
down, the water in the bag will cool off rather quickly.

I had a little accident with the bag in the luggage rack - while
driving around slowly looking for an isolated place to take a shower,
I hit a bump on a dirt road and the bag fell out of the luggage rack
and hit rocks on the ground hard.  Amazingly, it didn't split open and
is still usable, so don't worry too much about failure and leaks until
the vinyl gets old and brittle.  Just don't drive around with the bag
in the luggage rack unless it's strapped in there.

Don't forget that private campgrounds will often sell showers for a
couple of dollars even if you don't camp there.  Ask nicely.
