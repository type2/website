I just bought a set of Wasserboxer gaskets for less than 1/2 dealer price
from a FLAPS in Des Moines. They are Elring gaskets which is what the
dealers are selling.

Bought a set of rings for $50 when VW quoted $66 per hole!

They are willing to UPS anywhere and have been in business for many years.

p.s. The gasket price was so good at the FLAPS I bought a set even though
VW provided me a set. Imagine my astonishment when I opened the boxes
containing the heads and found yet another set of gaskets! At $190 per side
(VW price) I think they are doing fine by me.
