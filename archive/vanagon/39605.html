Got my Bentley today and sat reading in it for several hours.
Expensive, but I think it will be worth the high price.

Question...
My wing window on the drivers side of my 85 Vanagon is not tight
anymore, any wind resistance against it and it shuts itself. Do any of
you know of a fix for this? (Couldn't find much about it in the
Bentley)

Thanks
