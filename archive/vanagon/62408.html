Subject: passenger side interior light

     Someone suggested in part:
     
          Anyway, then I ran the wires up the windshield pillar (this was 
          the hardest part, as you need to run three wires up that pillar, 
          one power and two ground).
          
     Not to point and chuckle, but you should have just &quot;piggybacked&quot; the 
     wires off the driver's side light.
