Subject: 84 Running rich

Replaced the ECU on my Westy and some symptoms have weakened but it still 
looks like a screen destroyer at the battle of Midway.  At least people 
don't tailgate!

With the replacement brain, it still feels as if something is cutting in 
and out.  The thick black smoke is not constant.  Seems to run ok when 
cold and gets worse as it warms up.  That is what it did before but then 
it got worse and ran rough even when cold.  

Is this beast diagnosible or should I just continue changing sensors 
until the problem goes away?  I have checked all the wires are secure and 
connected.  Previously I checked all the sensors according to Bently 
using a VOM on the main connector from the ECU,  This meant that all the 
wires were connected and intact.  Is there any way to bench-test the ECU?
