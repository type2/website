&gt; Are these the Vredestein Snow+ tires?  I have a pair (studded) that came
&gt; with my Van.  Mine are 185 SR 14 90 Q M&amp;S.  They're kind of unique with a
&gt; &quot;shoulder&quot; along the sidewall.  Anyway, the max pressure is 36 psi.  Is this
&gt; what you have and is it ok to overinflate them that much?

I misspoke when I said that the Verdesteins were on the back, they're 
actually on the front.  I have Gislaveds on the front.  Here's the specs:

Front:Verdestein Sprint + R80 185R14 94R Reinforced 44 psi max pressure
Back:Gislaved 185R14C LT M+S Nord Frost C 55 psi max pressure

Sorry about my confusion.  Hope this helps.

Jack
