Subject: My Inuvik site grand opening!!!

From: &lt;ehintz_at_mail.utexas_dot_edu&gt;

Hi all,
     It's finally done-my Inuvik pages have arrived! 8.6 megs of gif 
files, 77 photos in all, and all available at my website. It's not 
complete yet, I want to add a pretty front end, but since it's taken 9 
months to get this far I'm just posting the puppy-I'll gussie up the 
front end later... For those newbies among us, check out 
&lt;http://www.chaco_dot_com/inuvik/&gt; for the original trials and tribulations 
of, as Unca Joel puts it, &quot;the Inuvik Idiots&quot; (I resmeble that 
remark...). And, for those ready to see my side of the trip, the URL is 
in my .sig, come on over and check it out. 

Peace,
