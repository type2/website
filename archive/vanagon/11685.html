Subject: Headbolt Leak

Hello,

I've been on this mailing list for about a month.  I found it when I was 
desperately searching for a fix to my leaking headbolt (actually cap nut) 
problem.  However, by the time I found the group, I already had over a month 
on my fix and I wanted to wait a bit before I said anything about it here.

Today I saw a reference to a &quot;head bolt leak&quot; in the &quot;Dan H's Heater&quot; chain. 
 So maybe now's the time to talk about it.

I had a what was more like a seep.  I tried two different brands of silicone 
type sealant after removing the cap nut, and carefully cleaning all the 
surfaces.  The third attempt was to use the VW sealant at $6 for a tiny 
tube.  That leaked as well.  I closely inspected the surfaces for pits, 
corrosion, etc. each time, but found nothing.  After the third attempt, the 
seep was definitely a leak!

Probably going against everybody's advice on this mail list, I dumped in a 
container of &quot;AlumaSeal.&quot;  I figured that I didn't have much to lose, and 
the huge surface area of the &quot;AlumaSeal&quot; particles would probably be 
sacrificial and disintegrate instead of my cylinder heads.

The leak stopped leaking, then stopped seeping.  It has lasted several 
months now.  Have I ruined my vanagon?
