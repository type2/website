Subject: Automotive Programs

All,

I've been looking for a basic Excel spreadsheet for logging automotive
data. I'd be interested in hearing what others are using. While poking
around though, I came across the following website:

http://devserve.cebaf_dot_gov/~bowling/auto.html

It has a large number of programs (and associated algorithms) that may be
of interest to this group. They include the following:

   Fuel Injector Sizing

   ET &amp; MPH Environment Correction

   Standard and SAE Horsepower Correction

   Driveshaft RPM Computation

   Aerodynamic and Rolling HP Computator

   Pistion Velocity/Acceleration Calculation

   Header Length Calculation

   Compression Ratio Computation

   Rough Engine Horsepower predictor

   Compression Ratio -&gt; Horsepower Change

   &quot;Best&quot; Differential Gear calculator

   RPM and MPH calculator

   Engine Displacement calculator

   Engine Displacement unit conversions

   Holley Jet Environmental Correction

   Intake Runner Harmonic Length

   Optimum Gear Shift Predictor

   CID to HP &amp; RPM Predictor

   MPH to RPM Range

   Miles-Per-Gallon estimator

   Highway Dynamometer

   Vehicle Battery CCA

   Vehicle Battery CCA Temperature Adjustment

   Effective Tire Diameter

   Speedometer Calibration (Method 1)

In addition, it has links to other sites like Goodyear's Tire Size
Selector, and another horsepower calculator. My apologies if this has been
posted before, but I thought it might be of great interest to some of you
out there.

Cheers,

Bren
