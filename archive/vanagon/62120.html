Subject: Help: broken rear spring in Syncro

Fellow Listees, I need your advice and opinions:

The left rear spring is missing the last turn on the top. It is not
noticable when driving and the van stands at an even height on the left
and right. But still I know that it is broken and should be replaced
(soon).

1) should both left and right be replaced together?
2) are used springs ok (the westy is 11 years young)?
3) are the rear springs from a 2wd the same as the syncro (4wd)?
4) do you know of good sources (new or used) in the upper NY/NH/VT or
lower Ontario areas?

And while I'm asking for advice: where are good sources for front outer
CV Boot Kits for the Syncro front half shafts?

Any help is very much appreciated.
