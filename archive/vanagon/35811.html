Subject:  HELP - different electrical goofiness

Hey all,

OK, get this:

The below conditions started last night.  FWIW, it was raining.

I've got something goofy going on with the brake lights/taillights/brake
warning light.  Hopefully someone will be able to help me figure out
what's going on.

Headlights off:  Depressing the brake pedal causes the taillights, brake
lights, and rear side marker lights to come on.  

Headlights on:  Merely turning the headlights on causes the taillights, rear
side marker lights, and brake lights to come on.  However, when the
parking brake is released, things get weird.  When the brake pedal is not
being pressed, the brake warning light comes on and when the brake
pedal is depressed, the brake warning light goes out.   I cannot figure out
what causes this as there are no common wires to the headlight switch
and brake warning light.

The questions I have are:

What in the hell is going on?

Why is it doing this?

How do I fix it?

Thanks again (hopefully this will be the last electrical goofiness for a
while)

Sean
