&gt; When I remove this transmission - specifically, the disconnection of the
&gt; drive shafts, do I have to put it on stands, or can I put it on ramps?
&gt; 
&gt; Put it on stands. You will want to be able to turn the wheels when you undo
  the bolts for the axles. The angle of the axle will block access otherwise.
  When you are getting parts, you may want to pick up some grease for the 
  CV joints. You can stuff some into the joints you undo and gain piece of 
  mind. Put a baggie over them too so dirt doesn't get it. 

  What is a hazett tool?

  Sorry, I don't remember the size of the hex.

&gt; Happy Holidays to All,
