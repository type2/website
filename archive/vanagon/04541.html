&gt; my favorites are 1) Sears Trailhandler in 195-70-14 LT  
&gt; 
&gt;                  2) Uniroyal LAREDO, same size, LT or C6 I forget
&gt; 
&gt; Sears was a bargain, free installation + balance at the time, good grip in 
&gt; snow/wet normal noise, no droning. Uniroyal same, more expensive though. 
&gt; Continental are like banana skins, so don't go back. I've been stuck in wet 
&gt; grassy campsites with them! Michelins are $$$ also. Like you noted, you NEED 
&gt; 6ply/light truck rating, don't get talked out of it, no matter the $ saving.
&gt; Welcome to the list, know any good songs?
&gt; 
&gt; 
I had the same experience with the Continental tires - I (and my friends) 
couldn't believe how little traction I had.  Got stuck on nearly level 
grassy campsites too.  

However the Michelin 205/70R14's I've got on my '91 Westy have another 
problem:  They cause the van to squirm and shift side to side in windy 
weather or traffic turbulence, sometimes severely.  I've had to reduce my 
speed to 40-50 mph on occassion, just to maintain control.  Feels almost 
like loose steering gear, but I've had it checked twice.  A couple of 
tire stores have said it's the tread pattern on the Michelins.  Don't 
know for sure, but do know that my '82 camper - equipped with the 
Continentals - didn't have this problem (actually handled extremely well 
in turbulence/cross winds).  Would definitely be interested in hearing 
from anyone else who's had/solved this problem - it's scary!!
