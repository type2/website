Subject: ??? Syncro front half-shaft removal
Date: Mon, 28 Nov 94 9:16:02 PST


Has anyone removed the half-shaft(s) from the front of a Syncro?  My
CV boot developed a pinhole over the weekend, and needs to be replaced.

What needs to be removed in order to pull this sucker out?  So far I've
removed the tie-rod end and stabilizer.  Do I really have to remove the
whole wheel bearing hub assembly in order to press the half-shaft out
of the bearing?  I've tried pressing off the shaft with the assembly still
attached, but there doesn't seem to be enough room for the stub to clear
the bearing assembly.

Any pointers, or confirmation that everything _does_ need to be removed would
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

-Jim
