	Friends,
	I don't have a pre-67 manual but I'll bet a nickel that
the 12V busses have some kind of voltage regulator to provide a
more uniform voltage than the +12-+14 you get on the positive
terminal of a car... remember, everything's still hooked up while
you charge the battery, so whatever that takes (14V, 14.xV) is
preseted to the lights and accessories too.

	I'm SURE my VW Rabbit had a regulator because it failed and
I put in a new one. So Bradley and others who have 6V busses converted
to 12V may not see any effect in the fuel gauge because the gauge is
getting a regulated 4.5 or 5.0 volts. Check your wiring diagrams!

	Bradley, the fuel gauge IS a current meter. The movement is
a little DC motor that only turns a fraction of a full circle. Current
flowing through the coil of wire attached to the needle creates
a magnetic field that interacts with fixed magnents and moves the
needle. More current, more movement. Stop the current and the needle
returns to 0.

	The fuel tank sender is a variable resistor which provides
a variable current to the meter The fixed voltage from the little
regulator and the 'full' resistance of the sender give you a 'full'
tank indication, which IS probably a pretty low resistance. Lower
fuel, higher resitance, less current, lower meter reading. Turn it
off and there's no current, meter reads 0.

	This is exactly the same as the Bosch fuel injection
systems- constant fuel pressure and either variable size
openings in a metering body (CIS K-Jet) or varying durration of 
squirts (D-Jet) gives variable fuel volume.

	The key equation is Current = Voltage / Resistance.
In easy units of Amps = Volts / Ohms. This is Ohms law. Re-arange it
for extra credit to solve for any unknown given two knows.
