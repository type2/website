I've got to agree as well that &quot;Deadhead&quot; Buses are very poorly maintained in
most cases that we've seen 'em comin' thru here at Bus Boys.  We've bought at
least a half a dozen Blown-Motor Deadhead Buses for next to nothin' last year
to part 'em out.

(please note - we're not a wrecking yard or the county would be all over us -
I have to transport them elsewhere in the woods to work my magic)
