i think you are talking about Halon. works great ... only problem is, it
depletes the ozone layer. :(  so now, it supposedly is &quot;illegal&quot; like
Freon.

so what the heck is the computer room gonna do with that $$$$$ system of
Halon bottles strung around the room??? :)  they bought one here, and
the story is that if we ever have a fire, it'll work ... once. but then
nobody can refill it!.

yup. that's the stuff. so what ever happend to good old CO2?? did it just
fade due to lack of &quot;zip/style/pizzaz&quot;?? or does it do serious bad things
to people/plants/animals/atmosphere (other than freezing the crap out of
whatever you spray it on! ... want cold beer in the commcenter??? :)
