&gt;I don't know if that's what the terminal is for, but 
&gt;whoever told you that  did know something about 
&gt;European cars.  Typically, when the ignition switch  is 
&gt;off in a European car, leaving the blinker stalk up or 
&gt;down will turn  on the front and rear parking lights on 
&gt;that side of the car.

True.  Don't yer wagens do dat?

&gt;When I was  living there I asked 
&gt;someone why this was, and they said that it was for  
&gt;safety.

Dat's what dey say awright.

&gt;Europeans tend to park their cars on sidewalks 
&gt;a lot (half on, half  off) and leaving the lights on 
&gt;helps to make up for the danger of leaving  their cars 
&gt;sticking out into traffic.

&lt;suppressed giggling&gt;  Yup.  We do.  And it doesn't.

&gt;Supposedly, the running 
&gt;lights are  not bright enough to drain the battery if 
&gt;just left for a few hours.

Unless you got a cracked battery (speaking from experience)

The 'single sidelight on the indicator stalk' is designed 
'specially to mark out our Volkswagens from the common herd.  
Although most cars and vans here have that facility, VWs 
*always* end up with one front and rear light on.  And *always* 
the one nearest the kerb!  A totally useless feature, im very 
ho.
