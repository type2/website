So Matthew Henricks says:

&gt; if you want a nice bus, have no time or money; then buy the one you 
&gt; want.  if you are into and up for a big adventure, then go for it.  the 
&gt; one thing that i enjoy the most is telling people that &quot;I did it all&quot;.  
&gt; that to mee is worth alot.  it is my work on my car.  

Well.... I guess I'm in it for the adventure... :)  I definately don't
plan on doing a quick job like Matthew or Thom, but I know I can do
it in a fair amount of time.  There's not a big rush but if it takes
more than two years, I would think I wasn't trying hard enough.  I'm
sure that when I'm have certain 'house chores' done then I'll be able
to more concentrate on the single cab.  

I'm really glad I made the purchase and I know it will be tough but
I'll enjoy doing it once I get going on it.
