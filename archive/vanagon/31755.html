Subject: Kennedy and the 2.2 Subaru

Just got my mail from Kennedy which outlines the Subaru kit they have 
developed.

Summary:
The 2.2 Subaru weighs only 50 pounds more than the Vanagon engine.
Provides 130 horsepower
Runs smoother than the VW and fits like it belongs there.
Stronger starter recommended due to the high compression of this 
engine.

The 2.2 engine needs to be complete - rubber motor mounts, throttle 
cable, air duct, air flow meter, engine computer and the four 
computer plugs.  Air filter box would be useful.  If you have AC and 
PS these pumps will be necessary.  Three other items which are 
mandatory:  ignition and fuel pump relays, and igniter.  The igniter 
is found as a small black box 2&quot; square, .5&quot; thick in the middle of 
the firewall in the engine compartment.  The small harness must also 
come from the engine, which means removing the suby dash and left 
fender.

the actual document could be faxed to you from KEP or myself.

Basic Kit:  Manual shift:  $520
includes an engine adapter cut from aircraft aluminum, and a custom 
228mm flywheel so you can retain the original VW clutch.

Stronger starter motor:  $240

Extras Kit:  $130
includes;
intake air duct (necessary for clearance)
detailed wiring instructions and blueprint layout for the computer 
(someone with wiring experience will spend a few days with this)
Fittings and petcocks to update the radiator system - no piping in 
this partial kit.

Future parts to be developed - estimate only - $395
Exhaust system with catalytic converter for ARB approval in Cali.
Radiator line piping, 2' long, PVC tubing, heat shield, wiring to 
reach the cab.

That's all the information I have at this time, however a complete 
subaru conversion could end up costing less than a H2O rebuild.
