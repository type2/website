Subject: Re: Taking out middle row in 7 seater

&gt; &gt;process of putting a rearward facing seat in the boot with 3 seat belts.
&gt; 
&gt; what do you Brits mean by a &quot;boot&quot;???

That's the *TRUNK*, man!!!

Presumably this means behind the rear seat - kinda over the engine. 
Interesting idea for all those kids with short legs.  ;)

I just toss my kids back there without any seat (of course it's all
padded, both in my westy &amp; 7 (5) passenger), they call it the
'backity-back' &amp; have a ball.
