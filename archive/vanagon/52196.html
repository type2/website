Subject: Westy/Vanagon parts sources

I would be grateful for the addresses, etc., of parts supply sources for my
'83 Westy. I noticed the availability of struts from a company called Volks
Cafe but I don't know how to get in touch with them. 
Also, I read about Synrco's. What is a Syncro? 
Also, I need a cross-over pipe. What years are interchangeable for the '83
Westy cross-over pipe? I have located a used one in Ca from a company called
help for  $397, but that was two weeks ago and it is probably gone now.
Thanks, Bob
