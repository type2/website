Hi there,

I subscribed to this list a week ago in order to help my wife and I make
some decisions regarding which avenue to take on our future travel plans.
We are intending to take a little drive around Canada (maybe the U.S. too if
we're desperate for sunshine)for a year within the next 4 to 6 months.  We
would be doing this on an artist(me)/writer(wife) budget which should make
it more interesting but also limiting in some ways.  Our first choice in
vehicles has been a Vanagon but I'd like some realistic opinions from you
people:

1.- reading my mail I see lots of mention of new engines, costly repairs,
oil leaks, lack of power, stalling, and furnaces.  Are these the exceptions
or the rule.  I realize that there are about 500 people on this list so
maybe my apprehension is unwarranted. 
2.- is the size of a Vanagon going to be too confining over that length of
time?  
3.- would we be wiser looking at some other R.V.(haven't seen any that
appeal) considering our limited budget or is the Vanagon going to do the
job? 4.- it is obvious that you really like your VW's.  Are they really good
or do your biases help you do overlook some of their drawbacks.

Look forward to the responses.
