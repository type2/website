Subject:      VW Type II rail vehicles - a bit off topic

     FYI, here's an inquiry I posted to a European Railway list and an
     answer I received.  Someone may want to cross-post it to the type2
     list (I can't possibly sign up for another list!).

          I know that in the fifties, the DB (West German Railways) (and
          perhaps other administrations) had VW Kombis (Transporters)
          fitted with flanged wheels in place of the rubber tires.
          Presumably other modifications were made to eliminate the
          steering and eliminate or otherwise restrict the swing arc of the
          half axles at the rear.

          As a VW enthusiasts, I am surprised that no one seems to have
          brought one of these to the US.  I also know that the DB sold
          some of these to concerns in Italy some years ago.

          So, two questions:

          1. Does anyone know how these vehicles were configured?

          2. Are there any still operating or otherwise in existence?

          3. Has the VW museum thought to save one of these in its
          collection?

     responded:

          The National Railway Museum in Nuerenberg still has a VW T1
          adapted for railusage ... it's a blue, closed van with glass all
          around. It must have been used for revision and control of tracks
          in the Bayern Area.

     BTW, I have seen one of these, and unless I was mistaken, it was a
     Barndoor.  So if any of you VW fans are headed to Germany . . . .
