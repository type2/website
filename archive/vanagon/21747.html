Subject: Re:Dometic fridges/coolboxes

Mention of a Dometic 12v/120v/propane 'ice'box cooler by a listie made me 
check the local RV dealer. Yup they can get'em, Model AB1600 and AB2100, 
about 1.15 cubic ft. capacity, Ready folks, $648CDN or so. They also have a 
deep freeze unit, similiar shape. For comparison a 2.4 cubic ft. swing door 
fridge, 12/120/prop is _only_ $788. Buy up those junked Westys as fast as 
you can, invest in fridges, while it's still an unknown commodity.  I'll 
keep supplementing my Koolatron unit with a block of ice thank you.  tim s.
