lemme see if i get this right: Ric and myself account for over 25 percent of
the traffic on this list? awright, people: you folks are not trying!!!
you only get OUT of a club/list/whatever what you put INTO it!! state some

he's a LAWYER!!! and doesn't even like Possum Pie!)

well, seriously, i'm a bit chagrined (is that like a lop-sided smile?).
well ... ok. maybe not.
