Subject:      rear hatch struts

somebody (ray?) was looking for rear hatch struts for their vanagon ...
and i just happened to get this rather strange message a few minutes ago.
i've deleted all the non-bus stuff, and i know NOTHING about these folks
... not even sure how they got my address. so buyer beware (?).

Boilerplate:
   All NEW parts German or OEM  unless otherwise noted. 100 day warrantee
on all USED parts, 6-month or Manufacturer's warrantee (whichever is
longer) on NEW parts.
   NO returns on hydraulic or electrical parts ordered in error. 20%
restock fee on all other returned parts. ALL returned parts must be in
original condition in original boxes.

Plain English:
    If WE blow it and send you a part that you didn't order or the
wrong part there is NO restock fee (as long as you don't try to install
it anyway and slime it up). Please be sure of your diagnosis. Try to
avoid throwing parts at a problem in hopes that it will be solved. WE
attempt to test ALL used parts, but some bad ones do slip through once
in a while so we tend to give the customer the benefit-of-the-doubt in
our return/exchange policy. The opposite tends to hold true with NEW
parts.
    PLEASE: If you're not SURE you NEED it, Don't order it.
