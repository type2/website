Subject:      Re: kayak rack for eurovan

G'day,

My PO had a yakima rack with a Kayak on it when i saw my (now) van for the
first time.  He had a Yakima &quot;Kayak/Canoe&quot; fitting on the front rack (___)
but nothing on the rear. Bungee corded rear ?.  Unfortnately he removed the
front rack before i took possesion of the van as well as all the Yakima
fittings on the racks.....  FYI he had screw mounted a Yakima Rack on the
rear hatch cover (low down) and used the Top Rear Rack and the hatch cover
rack to carry bicycles and/or skis on the rear of the van.  I will attempt to
diagram out what i mean...
