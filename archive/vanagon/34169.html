&gt; From SMAHER_at_PO2.GI.COM Wed Jan 31 09:49:03 1996
&gt;
&gt; Sent to vanagon_at_lenti, with copy to Gerald Skerbitz:
&gt; 
&gt; Recently I saw a 1970 bus that the PO had bought new in Germany,
&gt; toured around in, and then had it shipped over here to the US.
&gt; 
&gt; After it got here, in subsequent years it needed some brake work. The
&gt; PO told me that he discovered at that point, that the drums and shoes
&gt; were different from normal US models in 1970, and he had to get
&gt; shoes and a drum from Germany!

In addition to this, the super beetles (1600's) in the US had large
drumbrakes on the front axle while the European 1600's had discbrakes
up front. btw, European Bug 'IRS' tranny is not the same as US one
either, they don't even look the same...

Brian.
