This is definitely ON.  I'd like to propose the weekend of November
14-16th, at Oregon Caves National Monument.  In the redwoods, one of the
most beautiful caves in the country, and fairly centrally situated for the
West coast.

There is no camping at the monument, but there are two Forest Service
campgrounds and some private ones nearby.  Can anyone make a scouting run?

A warning for the cave tour:  Young children must be at least 42 inches
tall, and be able to climb a set of test stairs unassisted. Children may
not be carried by any means through the cave, and child care services are
not available.
