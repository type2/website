&gt; Yep, I think especially when it becomes a hobby/infatuation/life blood it
&gt; can get a little expensive even for the non-vanagon folks.  You start to
&gt; consider parts you &quot;should&quot; replace or modify that most &quot;normal&quot; drivers
&gt; wouldn't give a rodent's posterior about.  Of course you can drive it with
&gt; the rust/dents, but you know they're there and doesn't it gnaw at you?! 

I bought my 914 (type IV engine) for 3,000$ last fall. I've spent over 
2,000$ so far on parts, special tools, books, labor, etc. I couldn't sell 
it for 5,000$, but I'm keeping track of my 914-related expenditures to 
keep this project from getting out of hand. O yeah, we'd like to own a 
mid '70's Westy some day.
