 why?  :)  cold temps cause the alloy water jackets t shrink the same on each
 side, and I'd say your gaskets are both old/hardened the same amount.
 Uniform wear/aging.  Try retorquing when cold, this _should_ work.  I'd try
 to re/re the gaskets asap, since with no prior leaks I'd guess that they
 haven't been corroded too badly yet.  Anyhow, it's a warning...  Tim

Thanks for the warning.  I will try to hold off until the weather breaks to
do the job myself.  This procedure seems pretty critical and my local
mechanic will charge $1100.  He has done several of them and claims to get a
special gasket set for $400 from &quot;a company in NJ&quot;.  Any comments on 1)
waiting for 2 months and 2) doing it myself 3) other things to do while heads
are off?

Thanks
