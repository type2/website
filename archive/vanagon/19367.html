Subject: Re: TYP I&amp;II ENG. different??


I'm sure you'll get a lot of responses on this...

There were two generations of engines (well simplified a lot) put into 
type 2s.  There really isn't a type 2 engine (before the wasserboxer anyway).

At first the type 2 shared an engine with the type 1.  Later (after '72 I 
believe) it shared an engine with the type 4 (914,411,412).

It already has a type 1 engine (probably).

You can see for yourself the two engine types in your own busses...

&gt; 73 Westy (getting ready for a coast to coast trip with wife and four kids!)
Type 4 engine...

&gt; 71 Bus (sick engine, resting for now)
Type 1 engine...

&gt; 71 Superbeetle (stolen from me by my wife....)
Bet this looks a lot more like the '71s engine than the '73s... 

The change to the type 4 engine was to give more power/larger 
displacement than the maxed out type 1 engine was capable of.
