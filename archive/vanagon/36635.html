Subject: VW Rep

Thought is might be a good idea to sample the collective wisdom of the list
prior to meeting with our District Service Manager next Tuesday for lunch.

I met him a couple of years ago at a car show and was impressed with his
knowledge and willingness to help. Later I experienced the hesitation
problem in my '91 and he told me exactly what the problem was. He said to
take it to the dealer and they would fix it...no charge.

I plan to ask him if he has any idea about the existence of this group and
what he thinks about VW having a technical person monitor the list.

I also want to see what the VW line is on the leaking heads. I will also
see what he thinks about the $.05 fix for the hesitation.

If anyone has some other subject for lunchtable conversation, let me know.

Herb
