Subject: Ottawa Pizza Night: Tomorrow!



OK Volks!  Here are the final details for the pizza night tomorrow (May 4th).

WHERE:   East Side Mario's  _at_ Corner of Richmod &amp; Stafford in Nepean
                              Address is 1 Stafford Rd.

WHEN:    Thursday May 4th, 6:30pm

WHY:     Why not!

WHO:     Anyone with a VW tie-in and their SO, children etc

Please get back to me to confirm you are going and indicate how many of 
you there are in your party (I'll check if they take reservations).

Instructions for finding the table: 
 
Ask the waitress for the VW table:-)
If she smailes blankly, you are probably the first one:-)
I'll try to book a table in advance under the VW name.

c ya tomorrow!
