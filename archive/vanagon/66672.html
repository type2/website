Subject:      wtb: Tie Rod &quot;Grommet&quot;

Hi Folks,

HELP!

I need the thick rubber &quot;grommet&quot; that seals the outside end of the power
steering rack boot to the tie rod on a Vanagon.  This is for a power
steering rack and any year PS Vanagon will fit.  This rubber &quot;grommet&quot; is a
disk that is very approximately 0.5+ inches thick and approximately 1.5
inches in diameter with an approximately 0.5 inch hole in the middle.
There are two per car but I just need one.

This item not available from the dealer (except with the tie rod) and if
someone has one it would save me a trip to the salvage yard.

If anyone has an extra and is willing to mail it to me quickly for a few
bucks, please e-mail ASAP.

Thanks,
Ed McLean
