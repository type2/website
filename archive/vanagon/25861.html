I guess you're working on the script for the hit movie &quot;Endless Friday&quot;?
I could prolly help you with some material...

ObVWBus:

	An Inuvinikian * (?) was driving along in his bus when it
starting smoking real bad and losing oil pressure.  Takes it in to his
mechanic, and his mechanic says: &quot;Looks like you've blown a seal!&quot; And the
Inuvinikian says &quot;Oh no!  Thats _frost_ on my beard!&quot;	

* (That place in Alaska where y'all are goin')
