&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; In an attempt to prepare my 84' Westy for an 8,000 mile loop around the
&gt; country, I brought it to my mechanic to have it thoroughly checked out.  His
&gt; diagnosis  was that the compression is fine, the pressure test on the
&gt; radiator is fine (even though it leaks  coolant out of the over flow
&gt; container?), but of course it has a oil leak (big surprise). 

Big surprise?  Not leaking much oil then.  So forget it.  Just check
your oil, get a handle on how much it is leaking.  If not over 1 Qt per
500 miles I wouldn't worry.

  To fix this
&gt; oil leak (more like a slow drip) would involve replacing the valve cover
&gt; gaskets, replacing the push rod tubes &amp; seals, and adjusting the valves.
&gt; All this for the tune of $490.50.  I have little experience with this type
&gt; of thing, so I was wondering if this work is needed to fix an oil leak.  If
&gt; so does the price seem reasonable.
&gt; Also, I just noticed a ticking noise coming form under the dash, forward
&gt; toward the front of the van.  The ticking only occurs when I am driving over
&gt; 25mph, and stops if I put the clutch in or slow down (i.e. no ticking when
&gt; I'm idling) .  I have checked  for things that could have been causing this
&gt; but have found nothing.  Could this have something to do with my radiator or
&gt; cooling fan?? It seems to be coming from that general area.
&gt; Not having a radio you notice all the little things!

So get a radio.  Do you have a tach?  Ticking rpm related or not?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated :-)
&gt; 
Now maybe a real mechanic can comment!  :o)
