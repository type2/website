In reply to:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking for some suggestions on penetrating liquid to use to
&gt;free up bolts that have probably not been moved in 30 years.  I've been
&gt;using Liquid Wrench, but it seems like there has to be something out
&gt;there that is better.
&gt;

Liquid Wrench is crummy, but cheap.  When it dowsn't work, try &quot;Corrosion
X&quot;.  Ask at your local little airplane maintenance facility.
