Subject:      FALL MIDATLANTIC CAMPING UPDATE

OK,

&gt;From the responses thus far I basically have gathered a time at
least, that seems to be best for late October (get out the heavy
sleeping bags).  I'm looking at 17th-19th or 24th-26th.

Now a little alternative, Bob Busick reports that there is a VW
campout in St Mary's, MD the first weekend in October.  That didn't
seem to fit a lot of schedules but is worth considering, we could
simply join in as a group on this thing, a real plus as we would get
other VWers and I won't feel so odd, since I think I'm bringing my
brand new (to me) '79 Scirocco and a tent instead of a van.

Most of our responses have been from the VA area, with a couple of SC
people and a few PA folks.  I have recieved no clear indications of
where people would like to go.  Certainly October on the Blue Ridge
would be gorgeous, but frankly it will probably also be highly
overcrowded and finding camping may be tough.  I'm going to toss one
out that will be a little odd, but might at least get us out of the
VA area rut.  I think a weekend around the Ohiopyle PA area might be
real neat.  It is primarily a rafting center, so late in the year
should be pretty calm, it features a gorgeous river, some incredible
trails, and we could even educate ourselves a bit about architecture
and tour Fallingwater (steep $$ though).  We could also get some nice
high country scenic driving in the Laurel Mountains.  About 3.5 hours
or so from DC I believe, and we might also attract some Ohio sorts and
any NJ, NY people crazy enough to come.  However, this is merely a
humble suggestion, I'D LOVE a bit of suggestion and reasonable banter
as to a better alternative, though I'd be quite satisfied with this myself.
