Subject: Charge Card Chargeback Woes

This is mainly aimed at the listmembers who are parts suppliers, especially
for late model Westy Parts, but could also be for late Vanagons as well.
 There is always a risk of stolen or unauthorized Charge Card usage in the
mail-order biz and I am sure that most have been victimized by it at one time
or another.  This piece of info I pass along to protect others - There has
been, for the past several months either a person or group of persons in the
L.A. area purchasing parts for '89 thru 91 Vanagons &amp; Westfalias.  I think it
would be pointless to give names, but the shipping address is the same: 11250
Ramona Ave #317, Pomona, CA 91766, which I am sure is just a drop ship
address.  Having lived in the East San Gabriel Valley area of L.A. for the
better part of 40 years I happen to know that this address is in one of the
worst areas of Pomona.  Phone numbers given are of course bogus.  We had a
chargeback of $438 about 5 months ago in regards to one of these person(s) at
this address where it was determined that the card was indeed stolen.
 Previous purchases from this same address have not been very substantial
(under $50) and have had no chargebacks, but I'm expecting them.  Three
different names, three different charge #s.  Yesterday, Bill took an order
for a 90 Westy Poptop Canvas from another name, another charge #, same
address.  I have a habit of looking at each order and upon spotting the
address, the requisite bells and whistles went off.  Called the issuing bank
(Citibank VISA) and yep, the cardholder name does not match what was given
us.  In fact it belonged to an apparently very wealthy woman with a very high
limit and lives elsewhere in the L.A. area and of course knew nothing of the
person or parts being ordered.  I might add that we do this on all Charge
Card orders since that last chargeback I mention earlier. So we've &quot;headed
this one off at the pass&quot; so to speak.  Hope passing this on helps those who
don't wanna lose any money, both cardholders and merchants.
