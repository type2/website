Subject: RE: Tach for '84

Ed asks if a tach can be swapped into an earlier dash.  I think so.  I
put the whole cluster (speedo, LCD clock, and tach) from an 85 or so into
my 81.  The gas gauge is calibrated differently, such that the E line
now means &quot;STOP.  BUY GAS.&quot; rather than &quot;start thinking about whether you
want to buy gas on the way home or tomorrow morning&quot; but I can cope with
that.  Some of the wires from van to dash cluster had to be moved from
one spot in the connector to another.  If you put the tach into the old
dash cluster, I think you will need to fiddle with the floppy printed
circuit plastic piece, and you may also end up with different fonts on
the speedo dial versus the tach dial.  I recommend the whole replacement
cluster if you can get it.
