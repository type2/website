Subject: Re: Vanagon Hesitation-2.0 aircooled

After a couple of phone calls to the local dealership, in which I explained
the intermittant heh-heh-hesitation blues, I made an appointment to have the
$100. airbox/wiring harness &quot;fix&quot; installed. The bus drove like I had the
tranny in fourth at 25mph &lt;lugging&gt; but occured in 3rd and 4th at 35-60mph
at the appropriate times. I described the vehicle properly as an '83 2.0
aircooled each time. &quot;Yeah no problem, bring it in!&quot; My lovely wife was
persuaded to take the time to drive to the dealer rather early in the AM to
meet the appointment. She was quickly told that this above described &quot;fix&quot;
is for H2O Vanagons etc only. DOH! &quot;No Charge&quot; I'd think not, but howza
'bout payin' for the wife's time and gas?! The bus is still accelerating
like a glacier between 35 and 57 mph. The dealer did say that the timing was
7 degrees off which is curious because they  did the very recent tune up
&lt;first week of this year&gt; while doing other work on the bus.
I can tell that I need to find more time away from the job and get a timing
light of my own. I also wonder if the vanagon should be driven like the
Porsche 924 as far as &quot;higher rev range&quot; than the good old 1600cc  motors. I
have read the manuals and have observed the designated shift points.
