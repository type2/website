Subject: RE: vwoa strikes again ...

	Such a waste, it makes me sick to my stomach that such things go 
on in America.  I guess it is the unintended fualt of the legal system.  
Such vehicles could easily make the lives of some one less fortunet than 
us much better, esp the BMW.  They run the engines dry? ech.  
	A few years ago I worked at a used car dealer where once a year 
they would hold a promotional party where older cars were run a full 
throtle to see how long they would last.  While th crouds cheered, I had 
to leave.  Later, I had to clean up the mess.  Still have a hard time 
thinking about now.  Perhaps that is why I have a storage unit full of 
books and auto parts from every car I've owned or wanted.  My SO thinks 
it's silly.  
	Maby a task force is needed here?  Where did you say it was Joel?
