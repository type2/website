'Morning all!

I just posted a Gearing Calculator on my web site.
(http://coyote.accessnv_dot_com/wayback) It's a conversion of a spreadsheet
I put together several years ago.

To use it you specify rim diameter, tire cross section (185, 205, 195,
etc), aspect ration (70, 75, etc.), max RPM to calculate, 1st through
4th gearing and the final drive. The defaults on the gearing and final
drive are accurate for my '71. Then clicking the calculate button you
will get a table of speeds in each gear starting at 1000 RPM then
increasing 250 RPM up to the maximum RPM requested.

This was helpful for determining how different tire sizes impacted my
cuising speeds. I have BFG 27x14 All-Terrains on my Westy and originally
created this so that I could check the difference from the stock size. 

Hope it's helpful,

Scott
