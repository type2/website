Subject: Re: '64 Bus front end &amp; Berkeley info

Bill,

: A couple of people have said that a '68 bus front end will bolt up into my 
: '64.  I'm looking at a bit of work and money on my current front end and 
: was wondering if this is really an option.

: Anyone done this?

: How much work is involved?  What will I gain?

I have done this--twice!  The 68-70 ball joint bus frontends bolt right 
up.  The difficult part is removing the shift rod w/o damaging it.  I 
didn't have any problems with the 66 &amp; earlier master cylinders and the 
68-70 brakes.  Advantages--higher ride heighth &amp; smoother ball joint 
front suspension.  The stock draglink works fine, though I'd recommend 
replacing it if it's worn.  I'd go ahead &amp; run new brake hoses &amp; ball 
joints while you're at it.  The 71 &amp; newer disk brake frontends can be 
made to fit, but it isn't as easy as the 68-70 swap.  Good luck!  8-)
