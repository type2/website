Subject: RE: Flat Spot Fixed


&gt;got that spot fixed. went over to the friendly vw mechanic and asked him to
&gt;show me what was wrong, etc. well, he adjusted the carb   while i watched,
&gt;checked the timing....that seemed to do it. then he noticed the rubber 
boots
&gt;from (bare with me i've forgotten the name) from the metal pipes which run 
to
&gt;the carb are cracked. possibly getting air in through those. gonna replace 
in
&gt;2-3 weeks. with the carb and timing adjusted he checked the points on a 
whim
&gt;and then the dwell. don't think these had anything to do with the flat spot
&gt;but
&gt;they were out a few degrees and he adjusted them. van runs great now.
&gt;
&gt;it's nice to know a vw experienced down to earth mechanic who you can trust
&gt;and learn from....                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Well, don't keep us all in suspense... WHO AND WHERE IS HE???   :^)
