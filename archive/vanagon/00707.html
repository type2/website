&gt; Alright schwarze_at_io.nosc_dot_mil. Where did you get the gague? What kind is it?
&gt; Does it really work? Can we mail order it?

Ummm.... y'all are gonna hate me for this, but... I can't remember where
I got the gauge.  I do remember seeing one just like it in a sporting
goods store in a mall, so I figured it must be a fairly common item.  I
will take a look at it and post my findings, hopefully along with a source.
For the record, I have a 3-gallon cylindrical tank mounted horizontally
under the sliding door on my '73.  Note that this is *not* a Westfalia
or a vanagon, so I don't know if you with late model campers will be able
to use the same gauge, but the fitting on it is the same as on a standard
5-gallon propane bottle, so if yours is like that it should work.
