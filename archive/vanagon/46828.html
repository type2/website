Subject: 88 westy roof rust

I am amazed at the speed at which topics come and go on this list... 
here's my woe.  I've already received good advice but I thought I'd toss 
this one into the ring.     Just bought a used 88 westy in great shape 
only to discover rust around the seal of the fron luggage section of the 
roof.  How do I remove that cover to get at the rust and will I have to 
remove the headliner inside?  And further what to do with the rust.

Plus... one more thing noted that the impeller on the water tank pump was 
off the shaft and further that the bottom of the whole contraption was 
simply taped together.  should I glue the whole thing together or use 
plumbers tape!

Wheew, my first &quot;post&quot;
Thanks
 Barry!
