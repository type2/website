Subject: RE: where are you, little bus ... just returned

Hoi!
        Sorry so late. Just got back from a shakedown cruise up Highway 1,
overnight on the Russian River, and back through the Valley of the Moon. We
have converted our 1977 9-passenger into a camper. So far so good! A
special thanks to Joel Walker for help with the sunroof (work in progress).
       -Eric and Gabriella
P.S. The view of Highway 1 from a Bus shouldn't be missed. Just ask Gabi
(the one with the white knuckles). :-)
