Subject: seatbelts + airbags

FWIW-
Last week a co-worker fell asleep at the wheel, drove off the road at 
60 MPH, hit a driveway embankment, launched over that and was stopped 
by a tree... the car, a '95 GM wagon, is totalled.  the air bag 
deployed (don't know the exact point) and he had his seat-belts on.  
he ended up with a small scratch on his wrist on a sore chest from 
the air bag.  walked away from the crash and got a ride on down to 
his business meeting that afternoon.

draw yer own conclusions.
