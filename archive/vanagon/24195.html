Subject: VW-'71 BUS-QUESTION ABOUT MOUNTING BOLTS
Date: Tue, 05 Sep 95 13:30:04 PDT
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

I bought a long block for my '71 Bus but during installation it became
clear that the case didn't have the nut pressed into the upper left (as
you face the engine from the rear of the Bus) mounting hole.  With the
extra ducting on the fan housing for this year, I can't figure out a way
to get the nut on the bolt coming in from the front (by the clutch
adjustment nut).  My questions are as follows:

   1) Is there an easier way to get the nut on the bolt that the usual way
      of approaching it from the left side of the fan housing?

   2) Given that I have the three other 17mm nuts securely tightened, plus
      the rear mounting bar on, do I really need to get the upper left
      bolt on?


Thanks,

Nick
