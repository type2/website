Subject:      100,000km badges

here's the advert in the VW AUTOIST (the newsletter ofthe VW Club of America):

For Sale:
Accurate reproductions of the badges issued by Volkswagen to owners whose
cars had passed the 100,000km mark, issued as a pair, these are the last of
their type. The 100,000km badge was mounted to the front quarter panel and
the St. Christopher was affixed to the dash. The 2-inch aluminum disks are
adhesive backed. Now everyone can own this pair of badges without having
to sell their favorite VW in order to afford them. $10 per pair, postpaid.
