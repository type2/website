Subject:LEAF Festival 10/18-20

hey now,

Lake Eden Arts Festival will be taking place in Black Mountain, NC the weekend
of October 18-20. amanda and i and stefan ufer will be going....amanda will
have that friday off and i'm hoping we can get an early morning start on that
friday. any vw'ers going? we could have a campout together and maybe a
communal meal. last time i went there were about 6-10 buses where we were     e
camped.

LEAF is good music, contra dancing, good folks and at the peak of leaf season.
