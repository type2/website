&gt; There was a message here less than a week ago concerning VW Bus Heaven of
&gt; Kingston, MA, to the effect that the phone no longer seemed to be in
&gt; service there. This sort of thing can really hurt a man's business, so in
&gt; case anybody got the impression that VW Bus Heaven is defunct, I want to
&gt; report this:
&gt; 
&gt; I ordered a bay-window rear apron from them last Wednesday, five working
&gt; days ago, and it was delivered today. The part is as described on the
&gt; phone--it's straight--and for $45 I think it's very fair. Nice people, too.
&gt; I don't know what went on with their phone, but don't count them out.
