Subject: VDO gauge color?
Date: Wed, 8 Mar 1995 11:20:32 -0600 (CST)

I have decided that the first two gauges that are going onto my new 
motor will be tachometer and oil pressure.  My question concerns the 
color.  Which is the most visible overall?  Just looking at the 
pictures in the catalog the white seems to jump out a little more.  
Opinions/experiences requested please.  Thanks, Jim
