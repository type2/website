Subject: Re: Westfalia rental

&gt;This is a message for anyone living in the San Diego or Bay Area. Do you
&gt;have a phone number to contact a Westfalia rental place? We would be
&gt;needing one for about a week. Thanks in advance - David Carment

I'm also interested in a Westfalia rental in the Bay Area.  Dan and I are
going up to Crater Lake for a romantic weekend, and I'd love to take a
Camper.  (Which I hope to own someday.)

(Still looking for a 1990 Vanagon Camper that I can afford.)
