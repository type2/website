Subject: Re: First year of Disk Brakes?


&gt;If anyone can tell me the first year for disks on the bus, please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;I think it is 1970 but can anyone tell me conclusively?



I own a '71 bus with disks in front and drums in back.

Recently I drove a '70 bus with drums on all four.

Years ago I owned a '69 bus with drums on all four.



The conclusion is left as an exercise for the class.
