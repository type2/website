Subject: Re: damage from missing bellhousing bolts


&gt;How can I tell if the input shaft is very slightly bent?  Wouldn't there be
&gt;some difficulty shifting gears?  Wouldn't there be vibration and noise?  I
&gt;haven't noted any of these symptoms.  I strongly suspect that the lazy
&gt;bonehead of a previous owner caused the damage to my Bus's clutch by not
&gt;installing the upper bellhousing bolts that secure the engine to the
&gt;transaxle.

With the engine out, jack up one wheel and turn that wheel.  The trans shaft 
will turn,  anrd will wobble if bent.
