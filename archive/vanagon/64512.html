&gt;&lt;&lt;  spent about an hour on a 84 in a yard yesterday with a scary front
&gt; impact (steering collumn vertical, drivers floor crumpled) &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Although I love our 1976, and adore the 1986 Westy, I have to admit, I do
&gt;worry about the front end &quot;crumple-ability&quot; of our vehicles. Neither Suzy nor
&gt;I tailgate, and we are defensive drivers, but I have always figured that a
&gt;hard front end hit would cost us at least our feet, at most....

     Interestingly, the above mentioned van should have protected any
occupants from injury.  The driver's door, while sealed shut from the
impact (low, to the front, and on the driver's side) remained intact, no
broken glass or intrusions.  The steering collumn went straight vertical
(from the crash, not from jaws-of-life, I looked) and the wheel-well/seat
support wrinkled a bit, turning the seat.  The driver's feet probabally
were pushed up but shouldn't have been trapped.  The windshield
probabally popped out as both the steering wheel and insturment cluster
were outside of where the window should have been.  The passenger door
wouldn't close, leading me to believe that it may have needed a bit of
help to open.

     I contrast this to the 1985 Corolla that I pulled a interior door
panel from for my wife's 87.  It is allways disconcerting to see the
blood still on the cars in the junkyard, though this person obviously
wasn't wearing a seatbelt.  In addition, I shot a wreck in on 20/59 in
Birmingham, Alabama where 40 foot long sewer pipe rolled off a flatbed
and over the median, literally tearing in half an 87 Corolla identical to
my wife's, killing the driver.

     Drive Safely, with your seat belt on!
