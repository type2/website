&gt; I would appreciate any advice for dealing with collision repair folks, as
&gt; I have never been in this situation.  Will I get to keep the replaced
&gt; parts?  I'll try.  Meanwhile, set your parking brake, cram it into
&gt; reverse, chock the wheels, put a dead bison on the downhill side,
&gt; whatever it takes! 

The first time I took my Syncro anywhere was to our local Sam's
wholesale club.  My mother, wife and I were walking across the parking
lot after parking on a very slight incline.  We heard a loud crash and
looked around to see what happened.  It took a few seconds to realize
that the large blue van that had hit the bumper of a sedan was in fact
my Westy.  I ran to the driver's side and drove the car back into the
space.  The sedan had one of those 5mph bumpers and it bounced right out
to shape without a mark.  My Westy did not fair as well and the bumper
was bent in and down.  I straightened the bumper as best I could.  It
looks okay but, now I have this wrinkled bumper to remind me to always
set the parking brake...

Question to any other '87 Syncro owners:
	My Syncro does not have a differential switch.  I thought that all
Syncros '87 and up come equipped with a switch.  Does anyone else share
my switchlessness?  AND  It is possible for me to retrofit a switch?
