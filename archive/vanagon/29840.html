Subject: Westy Plaid Fabric
Date: Wed, 29 Nov 95 10:31:49 PST

 I was just on the phone with The Trim Shop, ordering some accessories to
 plug into the famous Silver Socket in the dash of my Westy, and  the nice 
 lady asks me if my Westy is upholstered in that plaid fabric and, if so,
 do I need any? Apparently they have a roll of it that has been around for
 years and years. She is going to send me a swatch.

 So, if anyone has big reupholstery plans in the original color scheme, these
 folks may be a source for fabric.
