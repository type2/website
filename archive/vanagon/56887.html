&gt;Howdy,
&gt;Has anyone on the list been keeping track of names of  reliable Vanagon
&gt;shops whenever someone happens to post one?

I've been trying to, but I may have missed some.  My list also isn't very
large.  Check out:

If anyone has a recommended shop that isn't on this list, please mail me
the information.  Thanks!

Ron
