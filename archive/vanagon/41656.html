&gt;I received four noteworthy responses to my query about synthetic
&gt;transmission oils and GL-5 vs. GL-4 oils.
&gt;
&gt;Three of these are reproduced below (Tim's was too advanced into the topic,
&gt;typically). 
&gt;
&gt;Dennis Haynes points out that the Mobil 1 Synthetic oil *includes* a GL-4
&gt;rating on it as well as the GL-5 rating so why worry abou it? 
&gt;
&gt;John Anderson is emphatic about not using GL-5 and points to REdline MTL
GL4.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Alistair Bell was cognizant and respectful of both opinions and opted for
&gt;Redline himself. I'm with Alistair.

&gt;I read the quart container of the Mobil-1 SHC 75W-90.  It reads &quot;exceds the
&gt;reqiurements for GL-3, GL-4, and GL-5 and MIL 2105C.  Different GL specs can
&gt;not incompatible if listed in same product.  Especially form a mojor
&gt;manufacturer such as Mobil.  As for talk of gasket lekage, the VW trans uses
&gt;paper gaskets.  All oils have additives to keep the seals soft.

Syncros at the dealer list for about $60.00 ea.  Thats $240 for all four,
worst case.(after market are available but they do not have the Moly
coating).  The ring and pinion cost about $500.  The main pinion bearing
about $180 and the mainshaft bearing costs about $85.  Lets not even consider
the cost of all the other gears.  The expensive stuff is what fails and it
should get the best protection possible.  I've even considered using 90w-140
but I'm afraid the Van will not move with the extra drag.  Except for the 3-4
slider hub cracking, 2nd gear is the only one I ever see problems with the
syncro wearing.  Think about it, every time you slow down, you end up down
shifting into 2nd.  Anyway, 130K and it still shifts fine.  I'll keep my
Mobil 1. Amsoil and Redline also have excelent products.  Castrol now sells
Syntec Gear oil.  May try that in next car I get Kathy.  She says it's time
to replace the Rabbit with 238K. Yes, original trans, Mobil 1 since 123K.
 Engine also.(Got valve job at 123K when we bought it).
