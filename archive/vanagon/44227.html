Sounds like you need the high beam unit VAG #533-941-062 and yes they're
expensive from Hella.  But here's a tip - this same unit fits 82-88 Sciroccos
as well (hence the &quot;533&quot; prefix).  Alas, I do not have any used at the
moment, but I can get new within 24 hours from Hella ($99.95).  Try looking
in the boneyards (again) and ask for a right side high beam unit out of an
82-88 Scirocco - who knows, ya might save on it.
