I agree with Ian's statements. Yes, I was weaned on bugs, busses and
ghias. But unfortunately the marketplace, the federal government,
competition, etc. killed off the beetle in the US. Even in third
world countries the beetle was eventually supplanted by cars
from Japan and Korea, the exception being Mexico and Brazil where
the government &quot;subsidizes&quot; a low price via a reduction in the
purchase tax. Otherwise, the beetle would be dead too.

Yep, I drive my '56 as much as possible back and forth to my
office at the University, as well as around town. But I
don't enjoy driving it on the highway for anything over 100
miles because my EuroVan is much more comforatble and SAFER,
or my old 86 GTI can do the job better.

Speaking of my 86 GTI, it has 210k plus miles on it...still the
original engine. I NEVER had an aircooled engine go that long
without a rebuild. So I don't give a rat's ass whether or
not it doesn't take 45 minutes or less to get the engine
out...I've never needed to get it out.

BTW it took me 30 minutes to get the transmission out once,
so I could change the clutch on the GTI.


EVERY VW I've ever owned, whether its air or watercooled has
had a personality, has been fun to drive, and economical. To
say that VW has lost its &quot;touch&quot; with watercooled is
awfully naive. What VW has lost touch with is the US market!
