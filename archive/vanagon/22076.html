I spent the most of the evening replacing the cheapo Alpine radio with and old
rotary dial Blaupunkt. The Alpine even though it looks sleek with its
fancy digital readout and seek and scan could no longer hold an FM signal
(it came with the Van when we bought it). The Blaupunkt was pulled from an
old SAAB and seems to work fine, the only hard part was wiring up the
speakers and power. I tried the DIN connector but the connectors are so
small its impossible to solder each properly  so I ended up epoxying each
wire into its receptacle after two hours of quickly fading light.  Has
anyone had any luck with the DIN connectors?

Anyway my question is for those who have the VW installed two speaker set at
the back of the van. Do the rear speakers share a common ground? This
is all I could locate. Each front speaker has its own ground meaning you
can move the balance knob and get sound from individual speakers but not
the rears.

Thanks
