Sista!

Hey - I've been a WRECK about the weather over the last 10 days!!! We 
were showing a BUTT kicker of a storm coming through this week and it 
was giving me PMS - and since my biological clock has gone south, 
that's pretty hard to handle!

Yesterday, as reported earlier, was c-c-c-c-old!

Today, was BEAUTIFUL!

No wind, 58 degrees F, here at 8,600 ft.

And... the latest weather report tells me that the BUTT kicker went 
NORTH - and we're in for INDIAN SUMMER - through the weekend!!! 

What this means, to you city folk, is that instead of skating on 
Sotcher Lake - or ice climbing on Rainbow Falls - or skiing on Mammoth 
Mountain - you'll be basquing in the low angle beauty of late summer 
sun over the Range of Light!!!

It might still feel c-c-c-c-old to you dads, but it won't be a full 
blown winter expedition either.

YES!

:-)

The Universe *IS* with us!!!

Our local weather dad is calling for above normal temperatures in 
town... 70s +... 

Be prepared for anything - but expect the BEST!

XOXOXOXO

Kath

P.S. I can't wait!
