Hey, I missed the pizza gathering in NoVA partly due to erroneously deleted
mail.  I want to start collecting addresses of the locals here in MD/DC/VA so
that I can keep track of these things apart from VANAGON's voluminous mail.

All locals who wish to provide other like-minded locals with their individual
e-addresses reply here.......
