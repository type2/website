Subject: 1982 Diesel Vanagon for sale

I must part with my diesel; my spouse needs air conditioning for
medical reasons, and the diesel won't do that. The body, etc. have
130k on them, but come from the west, so the rust is very minor.
I've never run it in the winter. There are some rumples. The engine
is a factory replacement, and has 35k on it. We bought the bus with
the intention of keeping it for ten years, and hate to see it go....
What's a fair price? Let me know.                            -ed
