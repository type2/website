Subject: What's happening in WA? (neat busses spotted!)

	Today, I was driving to work (On Xmas eve! I work tomorrow, too...
and Monday...and Tuesday...) and saw the normal complement of Vanagons,
mid-70s (Westies and kombis.), and what did I see (passing me in my *ahem*
`76plymouth) but a `62 kombi with this *HUGE* luggage rack on top, going
about 70 mph, with a lot of crap on top. (This was a couple of days ago, 
BTW.) But today I saw a fiftysomething (mid-50's) kombi in perfect 
condition, original paint, no rust that I could see, still was 6V, (I
could tell by the amber glow of the headlights.) Going about 45-50 in
the slow lane. :^) It's pretty amazing how fast I can visually inspect
an old split. I'm amazed easily, though.
