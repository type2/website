Subject: Water Tank Depth Gage
From: jcunning_at_snow.win_dot_net (John H. Cunningham)

        The gage for the water tank in my '90 Westfalia reads full
even when the tank is nearly empty. A coil rides up a rod in the
tank to measure water depth. My ohm-meter shows that the resistance
does not vary as I move the coil up and down the rod. Presumably I
need to replace the unit, but how do I order one?
