Subject:  Derek Drew's frustrations with system

Derek, I was wondering if your frustration about the load of mail you get
is in  part a reflection of the fact that you subscribe to AOL. Would it be
correct
to assume that you pay for this service on a time basis and that in a
sense the extra load costs you money? If so I sympathize with anybody who
has to pay for their e-mail use. To me it is doubly frustrating when a
subscriber has to wade through ads on a newsgroup, because in a way the
person is paying twice.
Others who do not pay for their e-mail usage may be more prone to making
comments they would otherwise not do (such as this one)..... The problem
does exemplify a situation that will need to be resolved if e-mail usage
is to be more equitable and accessible. We could start by getting rid of
the private companies (IMHO-YMMV) -DC
