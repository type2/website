Subject: Re: DISTRUBUTOR FOR 91 CARAT VANAGON NEEDED


A competent machine shop can rebush the dist, even if it doesn't have
bushings to begin with.  Some of the old bosh dists were just solid
aluminum.  A guy milled mine out and put in an oilite bushing.  Was much
cheaper than new.

In reference to your message:

 &gt;&gt; I need a distributor for a 91 vanagon carat....mine has bad bushings
 &gt;&gt; which is causing it to miss most of the time on some cylinders
 &gt;&gt; ..cutting into right side of the cap contacts..while carboning up the
 &gt;&gt; left side....alot of new cap contact gold dust on the bottom...
 &gt;&gt; Does anybody have a good one to sell??
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; Thanks John Matchet
