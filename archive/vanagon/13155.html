Yo,

	All of you 4-banger owners, take a moment and thank your personal
gods that you have a 4 cylinder version of this motor, and that your
valve adjustments only take a half hour!

	I did the valves in the 911 this weekend, mostly 'cause the needed 
it, and another list members moaning about a toasted exhaust valve
prompted me to get going.  

	It takes me about 4 hours or so do do them, and I know what I'm 
doing.  Its just the awkward positions and stuff that get to ya!  And
getting halfway thru and realising you forgot to turn the motor over after 
the first one!  D'oh!  And breaking off the itty-bitty feeler guage, so 
you only have a little dinky piece left to work with...  Of course those
3.2 andup motors that we all dream of are much worse, requiring the
removal of just about everything in the engine compartment... And the
famous turbo motors have to be _removed_ to adjust the valves, -and_ the
turbo and wastegate have to come off!

	It takes longer to get the valve covers off than it does to do the
entire 4-cylinder valve adjustment!

	Shops get $250 or so for the honor of adjusting your valves; $450 or
more for the compleat tuneup!

	Then the big kicker - the clacking noise I thought was just a loose
valve was actually the shaft on #2 rocker having come halfway out!  Yikes!
These motors don't have circlips on the ends of the rockers.  There are 2
separate shafts and rockers for each cylinder, one for intake and one
for exhaust.

	So you 911-engined bus-people, watch out for this one!

	But,  to my credit, my motor _purrs_ now, and I haven't even done
the points and plugs yet!
	
Thom
