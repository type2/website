Subject: help!  FI worries

Folks,
After speaking with another listmember about the FI systems in our busses,
I need help.  I own a 79 2.0L Bus with FI.  It runs wonderfully, but there
might be some tampering done by the PO that could be a problem.
To the point:
When I turn the key to the accessory position(on position), the fuel pump
runs.  Is this correct?  The other listmemver says the fuel pump should 
only begin to run after the key is turned to the start position.

Also, the vacuum hose between my fuel pressure regulator and decel valve is
capped off, meaning they aren't connected any more.  When I reconnected
that hose the other day, the bus would not decelerate.  What is going
on here?  For now, the fuel pressure reg. and the decel valve are not connected.
It all runs great, but is something actually wrong?
Thanks!
Paul
'79 Bus
