Subject: Can this be done?


 While riding on a Bus goin' west,
 I blew the engine and made a mess!

 I wish to know, o' learned volks, can an pancake be replaced by an 
upright? I have (ugh, had) a 1700 pancaker, but it gave me nothing but 
woe. I want to go with an upright 1600, but I don't know whether the tranny 
will marry up, or whether the engine mounts are the same, or whether the 
shouding (around the engine seal) is the same. Mark.
