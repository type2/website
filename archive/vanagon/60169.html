Subject: Tire replacement - dilemma on MXLs

Trying to solve a tire replacement problem:

Blew a michelin mxl on our syncro westy and we are having a hell of a
time finding one to replace it since they are discontinued. Shops have
recommended the MXT as the upgrade but I guess that means buying two. If
we bought 2, would the best location for them be in the rear? The front
pass. was the blowout. The MXLs are in great condition, tons of tread,
but the VC worries have plagued our decision on replacement/location.
Like I said, nobody in the Sonoma County of CA seems to have an extra
MXL in their shop and these troubles are looming over us as we prepare
for a baja trip in 3 days. Not prepared to replace all 4 since they look
so good, it comes down to keep searching for a MXL or buy two MXTs...

Any ideas/suggestions?
