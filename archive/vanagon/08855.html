Surely when they changed filters they also changed the oil which may have
effected the pressure as well. This changing of the filters idea sounds
like a miracle cure for low pressure vehicles, especially those with
flickering lights at tickover.

BTW would a Bosch filter be built according to VW OEM specs? --
