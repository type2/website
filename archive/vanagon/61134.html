Subject: A tale of NO oil pressure (longish)

Hi everyone, I don't get to post to the list too much but I wanted to
tell this story because it might benefit some other people.

I have a 1987 Vanagon GL with over 130,000 miles on it. It still runs
good and doesn't use much oil at all. But anyway, we were going to
take it on a trip from Allentown PA to Lima OH, so I wanted to change
the oil before I put so many more miles on it. So I changed the oil.
Drained out the 20-50 and put new 20-50 in it, same brand. Took off
the old FRAMM filter and put a new FRAMM filter on. Start it up, all's
working OK. Off we go!

Driving up the turnpike about 40 miles into the trip the dreaded
buzzer of death and oil light came on. Pulled over and checked the
oil, looks good. Engine is sounding good yet, no loud noises. Start it
back up and drive off. Must have been a fluke. Got a few more miles
and the buzzer went off again.

OK, I've been reading on the list the talk about all the trouble that
the Framm filter will cause you. Limp into an auto parts store to get
a different brand filter and new oil. The engine is now getting pretty
loud and sounds more like an air cooled engine. Change oil and filter
again. Start it up and pressure light goes right out and the engine
gets quiet again. Drive off again. Oh yes, the only filters the store
had were Framm!

About 30 more miles and the buzzer goes off again. Now it's starting
to get old! Darn Framm filters!! Got to another store and bought a
different brand of filter and more oil. Changed both again and oil
light will go out, but engine is still pretty loud. Tried to drive
away but buzzer comes on about 2500 RPM. Pull over. What is wrong with
this stupid thing. 

This time I pulled the oil pressure relief valve out of the engine.
Looks fine, not sticking. Brainstorm - start the engine briefly and
see how much oil flow I get with the relief valve removed. Got almost
none. OK, remove filter and try the same thing. Almost no oil flow.
OK, time to give up. Called AAA and found out how useless they are.
Called a local VW dealer but it's now after 5:00pm so I found out how
useless they were too.

When all else fails call dad to bail me out. He brought his trailer
and another car - (American made and had no trouble with the rest of
the trip) The van just barely fit into the trailer but he had no
problems towing it home.

After I got home, I tried one of those 5 minute engine flush
treatments on the recommendation of my boss. Guess what, it took 10
minutes but it did work! I put new oil and a framm filter back on and
we've put quite a few mile on with no problems at all. Luckily the
engine is quiet again and actually the lifters are quieter than they
were before all this happened.

So I guess that the oil pump pickup screen must have been blocked with
some crude?? Anyway, I wanted to tell this story in case someone else
might benefit by flushing out their engine if they are having problems
with oil pressure.

Later.. . . . . .. . . Brad
