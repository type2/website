&gt; In addition to my '86 Westy, I have an '84 Diesel Rabbit that I bought
&gt; new. I haven't done anything to it except change the oil every 3K, and
&gt; it still rattles and clatters along as reliably as always, getting 45-47
&gt; mpg. It now has 150K on it and has developed an oil leak. It drips down
&gt; from somewhere, collects on the right rear corner of the block, and then
&gt; makes a puddle on the ground. I've replace the valve cover and pan
&gt; gaskets, to no avail. 

The diesel engine in your Rabbit is nearly identical to the
one in the Diesel Vanagons. Oil can leak from nearly any shaft
seal or gasket on the block, but I would start looking at the
main shaft oil seal and the intermediate shaft oil seal. Unfortunately
it is a bit tedious to replace these, since you need to take off the
timing belt, and then retime the engine when putting it back.

What kind of oil are you using? Try a 15w40 diesel &quot;fleet&quot; type
oil and see if the leak is reduced or dissappears.

&gt;  Is there a similar list for Rabbits to which I
&gt; could subscribe, and possibly get an answer?

I don't know of a list specific to the Rabbit, but there is a
vw diesel list: vwdiesel_at_pas.rochester_dot_edu
