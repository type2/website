              this time

Ok, I got the message.  It turned out it was a scam.  Stop copying my
personal email now!  I read the lists!  :-p

Anyway, now for some real content:
Anyone have a front floor mat for sale for my '55 Barndoor Bus or a rear
floor mat (gray) for my '65 Squareback?

Thank you,
