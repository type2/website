Subject: RE: Verbiage and Language on The List Mail

I'm just getting back in my office where I can read an large volume of 
accumulated mail.

Don't know how the rest of you feel and havn't read everything, yet, but ...

There were messages I did not consider appropriate, even with the (f) symbol in view.

The language and the gender insult(s) are a bit much.

Call me a prude in this instance and I'll accept the label.

I allow others in this office access to read this list.

My wife has access to my mail also.

While I'm showing others the spirit, creativity, cooperation and wit of the members,
I'd rather not have to be surprised and apologetic for something coming across that 
has no relation to the world of  VW and is also far off key for what should be expected 
as open dialogue.
