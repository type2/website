So J. Anton Elmquist says:
&gt; Hi y'all! &lt;standard apologies for newbie screwing up...&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I've been lurking for a little while, and now I'm ready to ask a question... 
&gt; My better and I are looking for transportation, mostly for road trips. RIght 
&gt; now in the running are:
&gt; 
&gt; a) a 1971 camper, some rust, rebuilt engine and clutch,
&gt; 
&gt; and
&gt; 
&gt; b) a 1986 Wasserboxer, scratches on body, 130K, new clutch...

I would go for the '71 because you're probably new to the VW Van seen.
This way, you won't invest too much money before you decide whether
or not you like the VW Van.  If you don't, you can unload the '71
fairly easy while with the '86 Vanagon, you might take a bigger loss
on your investment.
