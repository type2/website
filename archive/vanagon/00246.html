&gt;I can't believe that development costs for putting a Passat drivetrain 
&gt;under the floor of a Vanagon would have been very great, and they might 
&gt;well have garnered more sales here in this market.

Apparently, the Mexicans figured this one out as they put a water-
cooled powerplant into the bread-loaf style body platform. Someone
wrote the other day that these are powered by 4-cyl Golf motors?
I don't know about the busses, but I hear the Mex. beetles are selling
like hotcakes South of the border.
              *Please tell me more about this machine.*

&gt;and speaking of bread-loaf/bay-window buses, why don't you guys jump in?
&gt;surely someone with a 1968-1979 has considered a vanagon or eurovan? what'd
&gt;you think?  i found the vanagon to be not as good for running out through

I drove an '87 Vanagon on the highway and was *very* impressed with the 
amount of room inside. The handling and performance were improved, as I 
expected. And it had less of the &quot;tractor-trailer rig&quot; driving position 
experienced in my '73.  Poorer quality bumpers and lots of plastic though.
Eurovan - The local dealer didn't have any and the price scared me off.

&gt;&gt;brake-slamming butt-dropping **Cool** feeling ...
&gt;yeah, but how many of your passengers have actually screamed when you did
&gt;this? :)  i mentioned it as something John and Mary Q. Public, Average
&gt;American Buyers, wouldn't like.

To make up for that, there's the &quot;oh sh!t&quot; handle on the dashboard. :-)
