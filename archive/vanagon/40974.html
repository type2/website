Subject: Re: vanagon rear hatch struts and other stuff ...



I just received my new hatch struts from Imparts and they were indeed the 
Suspender Brand.  A big disappointment but I am going to give them a shot and 
see what happens.  I'll keep you posted.


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;that's Imparts    (800) 325-9043,  FAX (800) 525-9043
&gt;&gt;       8041 Hanley Industrial Court
&gt;&gt;       St. Louis, MO 63144

&gt;
&gt;I called them today as I need new hatch struts for my bus. I asked
&gt;them for the brand they carry (wanted to make sure I wasn't getting
&gt;Suspender Brand after all I have heard about them here) and was told
&gt;they are manufacutered by BMW. Went ahead and ordered. Will let
&gt;everyone know how things go.
