                 Part V: Texas to New Orleans


In this week's segment of the Big Trip report, Tobin and Christa 
continue working their way around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  
Last week we left them crossing the International Bridge into 
Brownsville, Texas, and into a land where the natives sort of 
speak English.  As usual, Tobin and Christa have little in the way 
of plans, and have no idea what the highway ahead holds in store 
for them...

February 13, 1995

Christa and I drove the hundred yards or so of the International 
Bridge joining Mexico and the United States over what was left of 
the mighty Rio Grande.  The couple thousand miles of American 
irrigation projects were sure effective; there wasn't much water 
left to flow into the Gulf.  Behind us lay the slums of Matamoros 
with their toxic waste dumps and the branch plants for huge 
American corporations like Chrysler and General Motors.  Ahead 
lay the Land of Wealth and Opportunity: in a few weeks, I thought, 
we'd be seeing some of that Wealth and Opportunity left behind in 
places like Detroit and smaller company towns through Michigan and 
the rest of the rust belt by huge corporations like... Chrysler 
and GM!  Viva Free Trade!

So we bounced over the Rio Grande, which we noticed had high 
mean-looking fencing all along its banks, and pulled in line for the 
American customs inspection.  We were crossing early in the 
afternoon, and the traffic across the border was light.  We had 
the usual border-crossing jitters, so I was glad we had to wait 
only a couple of minutes before we pulled up to the inspection 
booth.

The guard wasn't able to read our front licence plate because it 
had become so bashed in driving on dirt roads and through deep 
dips on the highways of Mexico, so when I saw he was struggling to 
enter something into the computer I volunteered our plate number.  
He smiled, and I apologized, telling him the roads had been a 
little bumpy in places.  He asked the usual questions: where we'd 
been, how long we'd been in Mexico, how long we'd be staying in 
the US, where we were going, where we lived, and so forth.  The 
really great thing was he talked ENTIRELY IN ENGLISH!  It 
might be difficult for some of you to understand just how wonderful 
this simple thing was, but remember, Christa and I spoke not a
word of Spanish when we had entered Mexico a month earlier, 
and had learned our entire Spanish vocabulary on the fly, through 
trial (and often) error.  

He began to ask if we were carrying various sorts of contraband 
aboard the bus: &quot;drugs?&quot; no; &quot;alcohol?&quot; just a few bottles; &quot;gift 
items that will stay in the US?&quot; just some small things; 
&quot;agricultural products?&quot;  Uh oh.  I responded, using my best 
English, &quot;Does an avocado count?&quot;  He narrowed his eyes, &quot;Did you 
buy it in Mexico?&quot;  &quot;Yes, just a few hours ago,&quot; I replied.  He 
nodded slowly, knowingly, and scratched a few ominous-looking 
scratches on a piece of paper which he stuck under our windshield 
wiper.  &quot;Pull over by the building over there for an inspection,&quot; 
he said, as he pointed at the customs building and exposed a large 
revolver hanging at his hip, &quot;and have a nice day.&quot;  

We drove carefully, slowly, over to the building, being sure not 
to make any sudden moves.  You never know what these guys will do 
when faced with avocado smugglers.  As we pulled to a stop, a 
group of six or seven inspection officers approached our camper.  
We got out slowly.  I handed them our contraband avocado.  Christa 
was a little bummed; she'd been looking forward to eating that 
avocado.  What was she going to do now?  They don't allow fruit in 
Texas.  The other officers were passing the time pounding on the 
side of the bus, and looking through all out stuff.  Some of them 
were crawling around under the bus.  I assured them we didn't have 
any more vegetables, but they looked anyway.  After five or ten 
minutes, they seemed satisfied I had been telling the truth about 
fruit and vegetables, and they straightened everything up (!) and 
sent us on our way.  They even gave me directions to this RV park 
listed in the AAA guide!  As we piled back into our camper, they 
waved and welcomed us to Texas!  

So we drove into Brownsville, and I was struggling to adapt my 
driving style to the new environment.  Signs all along the road 
pleaded:

          DRIVE FRIENDLY:
          THE TEXAS WAY!

So I tried to drive a little less aggressively.  This meant no 
cutting other people off; no jumping into intersections before I 
get a green light even though I could see the other directions all 
had reds; no switching into the next lane if I have one car length 
plus 3 feet space; and so on.  Christa proved more effective in 
changing my driving than the signs did: she quietly asked about 
the gun-ownership rates in Texas.  I drove reeeeal careful-like 
after thinking that one over for about two seconds.

After half an hour of hitting stop lights every half mile, we 
arrived at the RV park listed in the AAA book.  We checked in, 
found a spot between two monstrous fifth-wheel trailers, and I ran 
the short wave antenna up a nearby tree.  We chatted with some 
very friendly retired snow-bird neighours for a while, then 
decided to go shopping at the supermarket they suggested.  So off 
we went.  Twenty minutes of stop lights later, we rolled into the 
kind of supermarket only found in America.  We spent the next 
hour wandering, almost lost, through great canyons of cans, cartons, 
kitty litter, aerosol cheese, shrink-wrapped vegetables (hey! 
aren't these illegal?), and nearly an entire isle of deodorant.  
Talk about culture shock.  We pushed our cart loaded with loot 
through the store, astounded with how unhealthy most people 
looked.  Most Mexicans look so fit by comparison.  How could it be 
America is so rich and full of plenty, yet so many people look 
like they're going to drop dead from a coronary any minute?  
Maybe I just answered my own question.

We loaded our camper up with all our loot, and zoomed back to the 
RV Park so we could catch The World At Six (CBC Radio News) on 
short wave.  We settled in to our site, with Christa preparing 
dinner and me examining possible routes for the next day's drive 
in the road atlas as we listened to familiar voices talking about 
snow storms, politics, and general Canadian weirdness.  We settled 
in to another beautiful dinner with a good wine, and we were both 
wonderfully content in our westy.  

Later in the evening we decided we had better get off our duffs, 
so we gathered up our laundry and swimsuits and headed off to have 
a nice swim in the RV park's pool while letting the laundry 
machines do their thing.  We took nice, long, glorious, heated 
showers first, and it was great.  We also spent the better part of 
the evening on the telephone, catching up with things back home.  
Our parents, of course, were very pleased to hear we had made it 
out of Mexico all right, since we hadn't talked with them since 
before we had entered the country a month earlier.  Christa's mom 
sounded like she was amazed we'd made it out of Mexico alive at 
all.

On our way to the laundry to pull our stuff out of the dryer, we 
ran into the woman who lived in the RV parked next to us.  &quot;Are 
you staying here for a few days?,&quot; she asked us.  No, we told her, 
we would be pulling out in the morning.  She seemed disappointed.  
She said, &quot;Tomorrow, we're going to be having a Valentine's Day 
dance, and there will be dancing and games and a cake walk and 
everything!&quot;  We could see this was the highlight event of the 
month for her.  We thanked her very much for inviting us, but told 
her we already had reservations at a place in New Orleans two days 
ahead.  And we actually _did_ have those reservations, too.

We pulled out of Brownsville early the next morning (Valentine's 
Day!!), anxious to see what lay ahead.  We got on highway 77, a 
main freeway, and the only road leading north out of Brownsville.  
A few miles later, we passed a billboard at the side of the 
freeway:

            ABSTINENCE OR AIDS:
             IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

Darn!  Well, we'd been married nearly five years, so I guess we 
were really down for the count.  Why hadn't these obviously 
intelligent, clear-headed people told us this _before?_

Christa just had to get a picture of the billboard.

Now that we'd had the Fear of God stuck in us, we continued north, 
settling into our usual 57 mph cruising speed.  It was flat.  My 
gods, it was _flat!_  Flat, flat, flat!  My foot started getting 
sore from keeping the throttle at _exactly_ the same place mile 
after mile.  We pulled off at a Texas Welcome Center and got a map 
and cool brochures.  We stumped the staff there by asking them 
what the significance of the &quot;Lone Star&quot; was in the &quot;Lone Star 
State&quot; slogan, flag, and just about everything else you see 
related to Texas.  Nobody could tell us.  Nobody.  They made phone 
calls, but nobody had a clue.  One woman remarked, &quot;I've worked 
here over 15 years, and nobody's ever asked me that question.&quot;  We 
left without our answer, but somehow feeling mischievously pleased 
with ourselves.

A few hours north of Brownsville my stomach started feeling 
strange, and we stopped at a gas station where I got minorly sick.  
Then it was over.  Geez!  Thousands of miles and a month in Mexico 
and not a single stomach problem, then one day in the States and I 
get a bit sick!  Weird.  

We pulled off highway 77 to go into Corpus Christi and then along 
little state highway 35.  Back on the &quot;Blue Highways&quot; again, we 
settled into the slower pace, passing through a succession of 
smaller towns, stopping at their stop lights and stop signs.  We 
got a kick out of the bumper stickers: &quot;If it ain't St. James, it 
ain't the Bible&quot;, &quot;The Bible says it, God wrote it, I believe it, 
that settles it.&quot;  

We continued along highway 35 for the rest of the day, and I would 
occasionally turn to Christa and we would have some form of the 
following conversation:

    &quot;Sweetie, you know there's one thing you should know about     
     driving in Texas.&quot;
    &quot;What's that?&quot;
    &quot;It's flat.&quot;
    &quot;You just told me that five minutes ago!&quot;
    &quot;Oh.  Well, it's true.&quot;

And so on.  Mile after mile, the camper hummed along.  It looked 
like someone had glued the instrument gauge needles in place: 
speed 57 mph, oil temp 225 degrees.  Only the fuel gauge crept 
steadily down, and the odometer clicked relentlessly away, 
counting time.  We stopped for fuel; we stopped for snacks.  We 
stopped to vacuum out the car.  Anything to break up the hypnotic 
road, which often disappeared into the distance without hope of a 
bend or dip.  We'd see towns on the horizon long, long before we'd 
arrive there.  

Around dinner time, we pulled over at a road side picnic area.  
Christa set about making us another beautiful dinner, and I 
climbed a tree with our short wave antenna.  No wine with dinner 
this time, but great eats, and Canadian news to eat by.  Half an 
hour later, I cleaned up dinner, climbed the tree again to 
retrieve our antenna, and we're off again, with the odometer 
rolling off the miles as we turned towards Houston.  In Houston, 
we turned east on I-10, and cruised along towards our planned 
camping spot that night as cars and trucks blew by us in the fast 
lane.  The Interstate is a _lot_ noisier than the secondary 
highways!

It was dark when we pulled off I-10 and into Winnie, Texas (I-10 
exit 829).  Winnie is a nice, sleepy place with a fairground 
right near the town centre, and well away from the freeway.  The 
nice folks in Winnie have provided a free (!) camping area here, 
even providing washrooms with running water.  This was great!  It 
was so great, in fact, that we decided we had to have another 
dinner.  We settled in, and had a great night's sleep.

After a reasonably early start, we found ourselves again heading 
east on I-10, rapidly closing on the Louisiana state line.  
Yippee!  We pulled over at the Louisiana Welcome Center, and got 
maps and more cool brochures.  Christa was really stoked on 
getting to New Orleans, so we elected to stay on the interstate 
and make some time so we wouldn't too late arriving at the RV 
park where we'd made reservations.  So we drove all morning 
and into the afternoon along the interstate, through lush swamp 
forest.  Between Lafayette and Baton Rouge, we got into real 
bayou country.  We agreed this was very cool.  

At Grosse Tete (big head?!), just west of Baton Rouge, we pulled 
off the interstate and south into the bayou and plantation 
country.  We joined up with Highway 1 at Plaquemine (yuuck!), and 
moseyed along the west bank of the Mississippi all the way to the 
intersection with I-310.  In the small town of Jeanerette, we 
stopped at the LaJeunne Bakery for some bread.  We went to the 
front door which we found had a hand-lettered sign which read &quot;Use 
side entrance.&quot;  We found the side entrance and walked through the 
open door into the bakery.  Let me make this clear: we didn't walk 
into a retail space with a counter and cash register and so forth.  
We walked into the bakery.  Like ovens and flour and stuff.  We 
looked around, waited a minute, then called, &quot;Hello?&quot;  A guy 
appeared, said &quot;Hello&quot; in a bayou drawl, then asked simply, &quot;How 
many?&quot;  We looked at each other, startled.  &quot;Uh...  one,&quot; we 
replied uncertainly.  He disappeared for a minute and returned 
with &quot;one&quot;: a loaf of french bread still warm from the oven.  He 
makes only one thing at his bakery, and that's french bread.  He 
charged us a buck.  He ran out to our camper, grinning like 
idiots.

We ate nearly the whole loaf in one sitting, tearing pieces off 
the loaf and slathering each piece with butter.  We sat inside our 
camper with the sliding door open, watching a little girl get her 
hair cut at the barber shop down the street.  The woman cutting 
her hair smiled at us, and we waved back.  With our tummies full, 
we headed on to New Orleans. 

It was late by the time we pulled into the Mardi Gras RV park in 
Metarie, a suburb just east of New Orleans.  Our park had a locked 
gate and an all-night guard who checked us in.  We did a quick 
drive around the park, looking for westies or other VW busses, but 
we found none.  :(  We drove around the park again, looking for 
someone else who looked cool.  We settled on a beat-up sagging 
small RV based on an old Dodge van chassis.  The gleaming touring 
bus conversions were unlikely to contain our kind of people.  

We'd planned on going into town that night, but we were pretty 
beat from the drive so we decided to stay put for the night and 
have a nice dinner.  Here's where we hit Culinary Bonus of the Day 
#2: the store was run by an East Indian family and they had a huge 
selection of curries, chutneys, and all the fixin's: dahl, 
papadum, basmati rice... and a nice wine, of course!  :)  

Shower, dinner, and a cozy bed in our westy!  Life doesn't get any 
better than this!

[Next week: We meet the neighbours (Bob's a friend of theirs, 
too!), New Orleans Mardi Gras madness, and something inside of us 
wants to see Graceland...]
