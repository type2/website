Subject:       Re: Speaking of Vanagon Shocks

Hi Jonathan.  Do you know if KYB make shocks for the syncro?  I 
just put KYB gas struts/shocks on my Golf  a couple weeks ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, they do.  We have the GR2s on the front and the Gas-A-Justs on the rear
&gt; of our 85 vanagon.  We got them at a FLAPS but I can't remember how much they
&gt; cost.  You don't need to have any of the special tools to replace the fronts
&gt; as the bentley book requires.
