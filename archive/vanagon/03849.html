Subject: Old, pre-60 bus question

I was cruising down the back roads here in WA, following up a 

rumor of a '63 westy being used as a doghouse, when along the road

in the bushes (blackberry, of course.) I saw a split window!

It has the protruding front turn signals, the rear were the small 

holes, (They had winnebago taillights wired on the turn signal

holes, and drilled a BIG hole in the engine compartment lid and

wired another light there. (I guess they couldn't figure out

that they had a brake light there, Thom.) Hardly any rust that

I could see from a ways away; (there were several signs indicating 

death upon entry.) This was all I could see from a distance, except

that they had it full of garbage or something. Does anyone know the 

law in WA about tracing license plate numbers? I have the number,

and would like to find the owner and inquire about a purchase. :)

	The '63 camper turned out to be a '67....and a dog had been

living in there long enough to completely rot the cargo area with 

urine, etc....a total loss bodywise, but all the camper stuff was still

there in good condition, so if anyone's interested in the parts, mail

me and I'll give you the phone # of the business. OH! I wanted to know

if there was any way to tell the year of this era of campers without

the VIN number. TIA.

`63 kombi
`55 Ford `vert
`5? kombi? (hope, hope.....)

Still trying to figure out how to create a .sig file, so I don't have to 

type this in every time...
