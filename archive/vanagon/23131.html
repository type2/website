&gt; etc!  Sale $17,995.  Schmeltz Countryside VW.  (612) 484-8441.

We ping-ponged between Coutryside and West Side VW to get best price on _our_ 
'93 Eurovan &quot;7 pass 5 spd w/dual air/tilt, cass, rear bed, curtains, table, 
etc!&quot; The price in this ad looks high; we paid $18,500 for what seems like the 
same model (w/o 'tilt'--if that means &quot;tilt steering&quot;) with 12K miles on it in 
May of '94. Much as I'd like to believe otherwise, this model has to have 
depreciated more than $505 since then!

The salesman at Countryside gave us a little note with a &quot;One Day Only--bottom 
line price, we're having a contest this month&quot; line. We took his little notey 
and left for West Side, where we found and bought our van (same model sans auto)
for about $1000 less.

My dad and I have been buying VWs from West Side for years (Dad: one rabbit, 
three golfs--one a diesel, a Quantum Wagon, a Passat Wagon; Me: a Scirocco, Golf
and the current Eurovan). 

I think the service department there is the most honest I've seen anywhere. 
Good, solid guys, straight shooters (at least in our experience). We buy cars 
from Bob Tusnia--nice enought guy, been there for many years. West Side seems to
stay away from the worst sort of sales hype, and most of the sales staff has 
been there for life (probably a good sign in the car business).

I notice this ad Brad quotes says &quot;tilt&quot; -- does that mean &quot;tilt steering?&quot; 
Never seen it on a Euro Van, but I wish we had it. My wife and I both get stiff 
necks, shoulders and backs on long drives....
