Subject: Re: Syncro on Dynamometer (for emissions)

Hi there.  In the Lower Mainland of BC, we have AirScare.. and they 
too requiere dyno testing.  With my Sycnro, they can't run the dyno, 
and they just measure the emissions with the engine at specific rpm.  
They can only measure 2 of the 3 gases.. forget which one they can't. 
 Just make sure they don't dyno it.. that goes for all AWD vehicles.

&gt; I just noticed the following in Bentley:
&gt; 
&gt; +--
&gt; CAUTION SYNCRO TRANSMISSIONS
&gt; 
&gt; When checking engine performance, only use dynamometer designed to brake all 
&gt; four wheels at the same time.
&gt; +--
&gt; 
&gt; Emissions testing here in Seattle involves putting the vehicle on a 
&gt; dynamometer to do the testing. You drive into the test bay and put your 
&gt; front or rear wheels on these big steel rollers which allows the testing to 
&gt; be done under load. I've never seen one that is set up for all-wheel drive 
&gt; vehicles. What gives? Do you have go to some special test center or 
&gt; something? Should I be at all concerned that they will screw something up if 
&gt; I take my (soon to be mine, anyway) syncro in for the obligatory test 
&gt; required to transfer the title?
