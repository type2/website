Subject: SHARAN article in HVWs


May, 1995 issue of Hot VWs has an article on the Sharan-- in their
pictures, it looks like a CHrysler minivan. About that size, seating
capacity, and shape. In other words... it's too d*mned small!

The article includes the rumor of a supercharged VR6 engine as an
option, and comments on a &quot;high-performance&quot; minivan being right for
today's market.

But I didn't read the whole thing... no babes in the pictures.   :^)
