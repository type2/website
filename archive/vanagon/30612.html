&gt;&gt;  I've had my bus well over 80 mph coasting downhill in neutral in pursuit 
of
&gt;&gt;  Bradley and his '77 on a steep descent enroute to the Panamint campout.
&gt;
&gt;I was in neutral also, but I think I was going 85-90.  I only got the bus
&gt;up to 85 on the way back from Bill's place.  Must be because I was going
&gt;North. :)
&gt;
&gt;It's interesting... it gets up to 80 easily, but doesn't seem to want to
&gt;go past 85.  Oh well.

What the h*ll??? I bought my '71 for the express purpose of blowing
Corvettes into the weeds. And now you guys tell me it won't do it???


I'LL SUE!!!!!!!!!!!
