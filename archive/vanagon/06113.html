    A major part of the problem is increasing population.  There are
    ever-greater numbers of people swarming into the woods every year; it's
    becoming ever harder to find solitude and peace in the wilderness with
    every year.  This means a couple things:  1) people who are there in
    search of solitude are having a harder time getting it and are feeling
    increasingly critical of their (too-close) neighbors, and 2) activities
    that weren't a problem 10 years ago are a problem now.  When there were
    1/10nth the number of people in the woods who cared if somebody made
    noise, you could just go over the next ridge and be away from them.
    Now, you go over the next ridge and there are 12 more people there.

The motto of the organization
&quot;Negative Population Growth&quot;
(NPG) comes to mind:

	All causes are lost causes without a decrease in population.

As one who finds irreplaceable
solace in wilderness, I must now
humbly yet coldly ask myself whether
I do my part only by lobbying for
its continued existence but never
going into it.
