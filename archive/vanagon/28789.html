Subject: RE: Odometer

Phil asks if Vgon speedo can be replaced with some other kind.  You could
try some other VDO unit that has the same revs/mile (tiny numbers 805 on
speedo dial) that the Vgon has, but look at yours first.  Sometime between
81 and 85 they switched from screw-on to clip-on speedo connectors, and
never the twain shall meet.  I put in a late-model dash cluster, including
tach, but had to get a new speedo cable to go with the &quot;new&quot; speedo.

So, take yours to the wrecking yard with you.  I've been given a price of
$80 for a wrecking-yard speedo I DIDN'T buy, and I paid about $40 for the
whole cluster I DID buy.
