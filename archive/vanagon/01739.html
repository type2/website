&gt; &gt; 74 bus, originally orange-n-white, now painted as a brick wall (red and
&gt; &gt; grey primer).  Hubcaps?  Black and school-bus yellow smiley faces over
&gt; &gt; the original chrome salad bowls.  Hmm.  I can hear you east-coasters cringe.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; I've seen your bus running around these here parts (Mtn View - Palo Alto).  I 
&gt; wondered what kind of wierdo would do something so neat to a bus (my kinda
&gt; guy!)  Do you ever drive it to work?  I'd love to see it close up some
&gt; time.   I'm over in PAL01  (Sun Microsystems - Palo Alto)

I, too, have seen this bus!  It looks real heavy!
