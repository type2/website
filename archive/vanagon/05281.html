&gt; I have begun receiving messages which indicate the original sender as sender
&gt; rather than the vanagon list as sender. I don't know if this is something
&gt; Gerry is doing or if my AOL software has begun doing this. 

I haven't seen anything like that with ELM (Unix mailer)

&gt; Either way, it isn't such a good idea. When I hit my reply button the message
&gt; might go back to that individual rather than to the whole list. 

I prefer it that way.  You can still send a group reply if you want, which
would go back to the list.  Having ALL replies sent to the list makes it
very hard to send private mail as a response.

&gt; About 1/2 of the messages on this list have no business being here as it is
&gt; merely mindless chatter from lonely people. 

Why thank you.  What a genuinely nice thing to say!

&gt; 					       I feel that Joel can post any
&gt; message he likes because he regularly contributes very valuable technical
&gt; information. 

Not to me, I don't have a Vanagon.  In principle, I agree with you, though.

&gt; 		 Some of the other people are just blowing hot air into this
&gt; thing and it has the potential to drive people with real jobs and real lives
&gt; off the list. 

Now come on Derek, ALL of us have &quot;real jobs and real lives&quot;.  Yes, that
includes Ric.  :)

&gt; The saving grace is when people properly identify their subject matter. Those
&gt; of us who don't want to read poems about our campers have learned what Friday
&gt; Haiku means. 

Agreed.

&gt; Messages still go through here like &quot;Glad to hear that,&quot;  &quot;I agree,&quot; or
&gt; &quot;Thanks for all your help.&quot; I feel that if you have this little to say that
&gt; you should send a private message. 

I bet a few of them were intended to be.  It's entirely too easy to hit &quot;r&quot;
to reply and forget that it is sent to the list.  I've even done it a couple
of times, and I do this stuff for a living.

&gt; Please don't generate traffic just to generate traffic. There are plenty of
&gt; places for that sort of thing in cyberspace.

If I might add a little pet peeve of my own, Please also don't quote 80 lines
of text and add 3 new ones at the bottom in your reply!!!!  Even with a 56
row window this gets annoying...
