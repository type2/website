Subject: BN4 info given....


Firstly:

We have at present 6 Eberspacher BN4s all out of late model Things, all
working when removed.  Most look new(ie.. grey paint still fresh, plexi
covers clear and intact, hose(s) and wires all unbutchered)... 350.00 ea

We also have 3 Stewart Warner Gas heaters for early t2 buses. These mount
under the parcel tray on the passenger side. Vanity plate included  385.00

contact me personally at busbones_at_praxis_dot_net

Secondly:

A couple of months ago I spoke with Thomas Johnson (address below) about
a reproduction book/pamphlet for the EB4. He sent me a copy (Mac format)
and I've thoroughly devoured it.  EXCELLENT reference...

Thirdly:

I have and can offer a .jpg of the original wiring diagram(s) for the BN4
if anyone is interested... again, post me privately

Fourthly:

We're in Florida and don't need no steenkin heaters... ;-)

&gt;
&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Here it is.  I've proofed it and think that I've found most of the OCR
&gt;mistakes but...
&gt;
&gt;The dimensions given on the template DO NOT work if your BN 4 was produced
&gt;specifically a VW.  Volkswagens used a different exhaust.
&gt;
&gt;Be on the look out for more exciting heater titles coming soon.
&gt;
