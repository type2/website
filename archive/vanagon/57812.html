&gt; Martin,
&gt;   I also have a 82 diesel Westy.  I just got it a couple months ago.  Mine
&gt; will do about 65 mph on a flat road. Do you know if it is ok to maintain that
&gt; speed for long periods or is it better to keep it at a slower speed.  I don't
&gt; want to blow the motor and plan on keeping it a long time. Do you have any
&gt; recommendations for maitaining the diesel, like special oil or anything else
&gt; like installing an oil cooler that may prolong the life of the engine. If you
&gt; have any good advise on the diesel let me know. Thanks!

I try to not drive mine &quot;flat out&quot; (pedal to the metal) for long
periods of time. This reduced temperature load. I keep cruise
speed between 55 and 65. Obviously going faster means more wear,
but the trick is to find at what point wear increases dramatically.
I don't have a definite answer.

The diesel already has an oil cooler and doesn't seem to overheat.
(I tend to think that the people who report that VW diesels run
hot either constantly run them flat out or have some cooling
system problem). I use CG rated diesel &quot;fleet&quot; oil, mainly beacuse most 
regular &quot;car type&quot; oil no longer have a diesel rating.
