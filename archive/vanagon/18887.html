&gt; Bummer. This doesn't sound like a very feasible retro-fit, especially if
&gt; you still want to be able to use yer bottom Westy bed.

It wasn't as bad as you think. This model had the infamous overhead a/c
unit which approximates the size of the rear westy overhead cupboard and
it looked ok. One would have to &quot;shim up&quot; the mechanism for the folding
seat to get the bed straight and &quot;shave off&quot; a couple of inches from the
rear left &quot;wardobe&quot;.
 
&gt; Did the article mention a 5 cyl Syncro model? I would be suprised if they
&gt; went to the trouble of re-designing the existing Syncro tranny to fit the
&gt; 5cyl, or conversly Syncro-izing whatever 5cyl tranny they may be using.
&gt; 
No mention of the 5 cyl in the syncro, but some ads in the same mag for
syncro upgrades (Oettinger kits, V-6s etc).

It seems that in sa the other vangons are 2.1 liter boxer powered, this
does not appear to be a diesel conversion.

I want a 5-cyl engine! From an Ur Quattro! I'm going to stop breathing
until someone give me one!


Well...
