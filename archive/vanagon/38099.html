Subject: Re:  Re[2]: engine cooling non-problem

I just got done debugging all this on my '86.  The fan is controlled by
the radiator temp.  The guage back in the engine compartment at the
thermostat housing.  If the temp goes up, and the fan no go on, bleed the
system per Bentley.  If this doesn't help there is a flow problem.
(Assuming the fan SW and relay are good as well)

In my case it was the radiator.  After 150k miles it didn't allow enuf
H2O thru to cool the engine at idle.  This slowly got worse until it
would overheat anytime the ambient temp went up &gt;70f, even on the
highway.

I was doing the rev the engine trick for a while as well.

 &gt;     This is something I've wondered about as well.  I, too, have an '85 that 
 &gt;     I've noticed the needle rise close to the limit without the fan going on.
 &gt;     
 &gt;     I've checked the 2-position switch on the radiator and it turns the fan on 
 &gt;     when shorted.  I've also looked in the Bentley at the wiring diagram, which 
 &gt;     shows that the temp indicator is wired to the switch at the engine while 
 &gt;     the fan is controlled at the radiator.  In addition, the cooling system 
 &gt;     bleeding procedure suggests that the engine needs to be turning above 
 &gt;     2000rpm for adequate circulation of the coolant.
 &gt;     
 &gt;     All of this, in my mind, indicates that when the temp needle starts to rise 
 &gt;     at idle, we need to rev the engine and let it &quot;idle&quot; at +2000rpm.
 &gt;     
 &gt;     Any comments?

 &gt;I have an 85 GL and it too rarely turns the cooling fan on.  However, 
 &gt;the gauge does rise pretty far when at a prolonged idle.
 &gt; What I've wondered is whether the 
 &gt;gauge measures the temp at the engine or the radiator.  I know the 
 &gt;fan is switched at the radiator.
 &gt;
 &gt;If it is at the engine, then it could be that the water pump is not 
 &gt;circulating the coolant to the radiator sufficiently to cool the 
 &gt;engine and thus the radiator never turns on but the engine is indeed 
 &gt;running hot.  Let's face it, it is a long push from the engine to the 
 &gt;front of the van.
 &gt;                       
 &gt; If it is at the radiator, then I don't think there is a problem.
 &gt;
 &gt;Does anybody know?
