Subject: back from summer trip tips.

Intersting and amusing.

I just got a new motor and they suggested a 500 mile run in not exceeding
50 mph.

I've heard also that new barrels and pistons can be tight and thus run hot.

Also if you didn't get all the tinware back just right it can cause
overheating. You must out all the rubber bungs and seals in as well.

Just some ideas.

Lee.
