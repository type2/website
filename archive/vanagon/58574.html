Subject: Re: The Silver Socket Returns Again! (Was Re: tiny push button, etc....)

Is this socket the same as used in trucks?  I saw a bunh of 12 volt 
appliances at a truck stop (New Stanton PA) that might or might not fit 
these.  I'm not one of the blessed with this socket in my bus ('93 EV) so 
I don;t know if all that stuff fits or not.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Also mysterious to me is in the dash, just under the glove compartment, is
&gt;  a plug which looks like a stereo input jack - the big kind - except it's
&gt; not.
&gt;  1/2 inch silver rim. Also connected to some wires which get lost in the
&gt; tangle.
&gt;  Any ideas on this one? &gt;&gt;

&gt; Just finding the accessories with the plug is another
&gt; mysterious matter.  You can get the replacement socket (and the male ends) at
&gt; a place in Arizona called The Trim Shop (specializes in Type 181 Thing parts,
&gt; which also used &quot;The Silver Socket&quot;)
