Subject: Arrgh! (sad.)

I was driving my `66 around last week, puttering along. Got hit by a
largish truck on the cargo door side. No injuries. My 2 y.o. son in
the passenger seat thought it was kinda cool. `CRASH AND BURN, DADDY!
CRASH AND BURN! Hahahaha!' Then, on the way home, I completely lost
4th gear. I am now stripping this bus, and sending it to the Great
Junkyard. She was _barely_ restorable before this, and now the damage
is structural, not cosmetic. All I have left are bay windows now. :(
And a lot of good bus parts--anyone need `63 overrider bumpers in
great shape?
