&gt;Does anybody know of a pull-plug key or other external disconnect? (I

there is a Bosch disconnect/switch available in many of after-market
catalogs. it allows you to switch between two batteries (if you have two)
and the switch handle pulls out so you can take it with you, totalling
disabling the electrical system. i think it runs about $40. you could fit
it to the side of the battery compartment on the &quot;outside&quot; (where you can
get to it). I know Imparts still sells it, and maybe Girot's Garage and
some other places as well.
