Subject:      for the new people:

anybody that has a vanagon and has recently signed onto the list ...
if you want a copy of some recall info (no claim to being complete) on
several of the years, let me know and i'll dump it on you. :)

anybody that is LOOKING to buy a vanagon or bus, if you want the file that
has the differences in the model years (even for the split-windows or
eurovans), i've got that junk laying around, too. just ask.

i'd like to know what year bus or vanagon you have (if you have one) and
which state/province/country you are in (just for data-keeping stat freak
type info). no problem if you'd rather not say.

thanks.
joel

we now return to your regularly scheduled program ...
