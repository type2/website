Subject: still confused

Hi all,
	Guess i was still wrong in my last post.  Can someone clear up 
for me a question:

What (if any) Eurovan and/or Vanagon comes with:

pop top
fold down bed
preferably front wheel drive
2 rear facing seat --OR-- middle bench seat (Either way seats 7)
full fridge
stove and or sink
tables for kids to color on/play board games etc.
cup holders
cabinets

If anybody knows years and models I'd appreciate.  At least then I can 
get a grip on what I'm looking for.

Thanks again everybody--as always your expertise has proven 
invaluable...The endless quest continues...Thad
