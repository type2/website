Subject: Bus Depot is NOT Bus Boys
Date: Tue, 19 Aug 1997 01:30:31 -0400


I see that Ron Lussier pointed this out already (at least on the Vanagon
list), but considering the bad press that Bus Boys is getting recently
(regardless of whether it's justified; not my business, literally) -and in
view of the apparant confusion on the part of a couple of readers regarding
the similar names-  I thought I'd better make this point very clear in the
subject header itself.  

I am not, nor ever was, related to Bus Boys, or Jim Thompson, or for that
matter anyone else VW parts-related.  Any orders that I may screw up are
totally and completely my fault.  :-)

&gt; &gt;I just ordered some parts from a gentleman named Ron at Bus Depot.  He
has
&gt; &gt;always been helpful with any questions I've had, whether he could sell
me
&gt; &gt;the part or not. 

&gt; &gt;Ron at the Bus Depot is a good guy.  He's very busy, so things might 
&gt; &gt;be slow at times, but he comes through.  He's also an asset to the 
&gt; &gt;list 
 

&gt; Bus Boys and Bus Depot are two separate businesses, and a continent
apart.
&gt; I've never heard any complaints about Bus Depot.  Quite the opposite.
