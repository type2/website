Subject: 2 litre align bore

Greetings all

I have a second hand 2 litre short block which I intend 
rebuilding and fitting into an 1800 Kombi camper.  

Upon dismantling the case I discovered writing (VW logo and
some numbers) on one of the main bearing journals (no. 2) which
suggests to me that the case has not previously been align bored.  
Does this logic hold true for those in the know?  

Thanks in advance.
