Obviously junkyards. But if there's no luck there, you might try calling
Hella directly.  They have an 800 number but I dont seem to have it around.
They can tell you who else might have it.  I would also call Pep Boys.
They handle Hella, have great prices, and can order just about any hella
stock number.

Of course if it's a dealer only part, there are dealers that discount for
list members.  Good Luck
