&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know whether you have Discount Tire where you are, but their prices
&gt;&gt;&gt;are truly unbeatable.  &gt;&gt;

&gt;I just called the Discount Tire Center here in the Bay Area. They want
&gt;$10.95 each tire for balancing and mounting, plus valves and disposal.
&gt;But the Price Club charges only $5 for all these.
&gt;
&gt;I think I am going to give the Uniroyal Laredo LT195/75R14 a try. If I
&gt;insist on Michelin XZX 185R14 I will have to buy for Michelin dealers.
&gt;The price for the tire is only $7 more each but all other charges add up
&gt;to be almost $100 more for 4 tires.
&gt;
&gt;So how do you net heads think?

I realize it ain't a Eurovan or even a Vanagon, but: for ye faithful 79
Bus, I bought Summit Trail Climber 205/75R14LT's.  I was going to have to
special order tires for the Bus no matter what, and went with these because
I've had excellent experience with Summits in the past.  The garage got
them and they were $68 each, mounted &amp; balanced.  These tires greatly
improved cornering and have helped quite a bit in high crosswinds.  They do
ride a bit rougher than the old tires (awful Kelly-Springfields) but are
superior otherwise.
