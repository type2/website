&gt; I'm also in the process installing an ammeter and I am wondering what the 
&gt; best way is to run cables from the engine compartment all the way to the 
&gt; dashboard and back. Under the carpet? Behind the cabinets?

Stefan,

If you want to monitor the state of your charging system and battery, 
you would probably be better off installing a voltmeter in the dash. 
Then you could just hook in small gauge wires somewhere in the dash. 
A voltmeter tells you the charging voltage, discharge voltage, and 
cranking voltage, all of which should indicate the state of your 
system.

If you still insist on putting an ammeter up front, doesn't the +12 
run up to the fusebox up front before it goes to the rest of the bus? 
Therefore, you should be able to tap in to the line just before the 
fuse box. 

Rich.
