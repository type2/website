VW OWNERS UNITE!!!!


VOLKSNET IS COMMING!!!!

This aint no cheesy server!

This aint no cheesy domain!

This is an entire web hub..... an ALL VW HUB..... 24-7 all VW's, all the
time!

Tired of being gouged by the minute?  VOLKSNET will be your answer!  One
monthly access fee with nationwide coverage!

Got your interest yet?  How about live tech sessions, direct satellite feed,
event coverage, road trip info &amp; stories, nationwide junkyard guide,  chat
rooms, tons of pictures, online catalogs, a free guide to other VW nuts on
the net, business &amp; shop reviews, video clips, even a game server, and much,
much more!!!!!

VOLKSNET is currently in the construction and test phase of its
incarnation.... We need your input!   What would you like to see on the
service?  What wouldn't you like to see?  ISDN vs. T1?  Let us know!!!!
