Subject: Tent replacements...

Just musing on a cold day here in NY...

My tent on the '71 Westy is kind of shot. Anyone have experience with various 
aftermarket replacements? JCW, others... They all promise OEM quality, but I 
have come to regard that with a little skepticism. 

For some reason when I'm working here at home I get an irresistible urge to 
order parts from catalogs. Somebody stop me!
