Subject: Exhausts that replace the heater boxes?

I'm fed up with heater boxes that need replacing all the time, or leak,
or whatever. Since I have a gas heater anyway, I am looking for an
exhaust system that does away with the h-boxes, and uses a simple tube
system like headers or whatever. Rocky Mt. doesn't have them, so I would
appreciate any info. It's for a 78 Westphalia 2 litre. 
Thanks!!
Courtney
