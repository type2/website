Subject: GIFTS TO BOB (was: Grendel, Tuesday II)



&gt;maybe it's time to play your trump card.  you mentioned strained host
&gt;relations...  i think an outpouring of gifts from around the country
&gt;to your host's home, maple syrup or wild rice from Minnesota, possum
&gt;steaks from Alabama, etc. may be in order.  just an idea.  you know
&gt;what's best.


An EXCELLENT idea. Does anyone have the host's address??? He is not the
one with the shop, I know... correct me if I'm wrong, but he has been
quite a nice guy. Everyone has limits, tho... the host deserves
recompense, just as Bob deserves our support.

Please, anyone on the list who has the address, please post it, or
send to me directly? Thanx a 10**6.
