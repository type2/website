Subject: Re: Diesel verse gas?

My mother owns a '91 Jetta Diesel.  I can drive from southern CT to
central NY and back on a single tank (600mi).  It's great on fuel, almost
never needs engine work, and is fun to drive...
But, VWoA simply dropped the 52 hp diesel engine onto the regular
gasoline tranny, so the torque is not taken advantage of, and acceleration
is dangerously slow =^0
