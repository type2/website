Ooooooo, VWBUS 1970-present!  Gives a whole new meaning to
the concept of boot camp:

&quot;Alright you guys, I want all four of those boots off,
the bearings cleaned and repacked before 0700 today!!!!
I want those bearings to shine, you hear me, shine!!!  
You think THAT'S enough grease, eh?, well when you're 
on a deserted highway in the middle of
the night and you start hearing this high-pitched whine
coming from your backside don't come crying to me!&quot;
