Subject: swapping engines...

dear list !
  pretty soon i'll be swapping the engines between my 73/1700cc and my
74/1800cc, both carbureted. i just got the clutch parts, and i'm planning to
overhaul both alternator and starter motor while i'm in there, plus i'll
probably replace all hoses that are careless enough to cross my path. any
suggestions on what else to do while i'm in there? like, clean up anything
(heater boxes ? oil cooler ?), or what ?
  permission to speak freely !

        gregor, 73 westy &quot;FESTUS&quot;
                74 bus &quot;please don't take out my engine, no, AAARRRRGGHHH..&quot;
