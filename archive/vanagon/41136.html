Subject: Big, heavy wheeled things vs. little, light wheeled things


&gt;if you ride bicycles or motorcycles, then you have to beware of automobiles
&gt;AND trucks ... cause they completely ignore you!

I've ridden bicycles all my life, mostly on public streets, when not in
my VW  :^) . I've long held that anyone who rides a bicycle out in the
traffic stream, instead of along the side of the road, needs his head
examined. Yet I *often* see bicyclists in car left-turn lanes. When the
light changes, they start up, and turn left while a dozen cars loiter
slowly along behind them. Then they cut through two or three lanes of
traffic to get to the right side of the road.

Hey, guys, whatever happened to the old trick of crossing the street
twice? You know, get to the intersection, put your foot down, then
crossing in whichever direction is going, then waiting for the light
to change and crossing the next direction and continue on your merry way?

Remember, those cute helmets you wear, serve only to make the remains
identifiable after a collision with a car...

ObVW Content: I got my '71 bus, and later the V6anagon, mostly for the
purpose of throwing my and my son's bikes inside (racks? we don't need
no steenking racks!), and zooming off to the lake for a great 5-mile
ride. Such a car...
