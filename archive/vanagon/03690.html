Subject: Re: Oil Pressure Springs and Pressure adjusters

/On an unrelated topic. I also have  in my possession (courtesy of JCW) two
/items designed to boost oil pressure: a) an annular pressure valve piston
/with extra strong
/spring (claimed 15% drop in oil temps) and b) a dial-in pressure adjuster that
/fits below the pressure
/valve piston. Any ideas or opinions on these would be appreciated before
/I install them at the next oil change. DC

I also fell prey to this little 'improvement.' For a couple of bucks, I thought
I could get my pressure back up and all would be groovy. I was wrong.

Thinking about it now, I realize that the stringer spring goes in the
pressure relief hole. That valve does not open until the pressure gets
too high at the bearings, etc. then it vents the oil back to the sump.
The problem is that this increses the pressure between the pump and
the bearings. My oil cooler now leaks like a sieve whenever the engine
is cold, and until it heats up. Sure the pressure at the gauge is 
higher, but it does not help in cooling or adequately lubricating parts.

What should happen is that excess oil should be thrown back into the 
case, AFTER A TRIP THROUGH THE COOLER. It does not flow over the metal parts,
they are getting all the cooling oil they can get, keeping the oil cool. With
these little 'wonder springs' they make the pump work much harder, and the oil
may move over the internal parts alittle faster, but the engine has to work
that much harder to pump the oil to high pressures. When the oil is hot, and 
the overpressure spring is closed, all the oil is going over the bearings
and the spring does not help at all.

My advice: Ditch the springs, keep the grooved plunger (It really is better
at the cold-oil-pressure-relief valve end), and make sure that those bores
are clean and the plungers slide freely.

If I can find another stock spring, I will put it in. I hat having to 
wash oil off the the left side of the engine all the time. It just
drips out until the engine is warm. (I even have good german oil seals)

Good Luck
