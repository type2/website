I don't know about the reactions of 14 year olds, but when I was a sophomore
at the University of Kansas I bought my first bus, a 1971 model--White over
Kansas Beige.  There were girls (this was back in my heterosexual days) that
WOULD NOT go out with me because I drove a VW Bus.  I'm not sure this was
because they were embarassed to be seen in it or whether they were nervous
about what would happen in it.

Come to think of it, present (and last) Significant Other seems to prefer my
Passat Wagon but recognizes the practicality of loading the bikes in my 1985
Vanagon.
