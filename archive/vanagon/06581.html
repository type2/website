&gt; I have a blumenvase in my '56. It made a hit with my &quot;psychologist&quot;
&gt; wife (hey...I figured if I married one, I wouldn't have to spend
&gt; money on therapy...as if I needed it!) who said the vase showed that
&gt; I was very secure with my masculinity...for whatever that was worth..
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, during the summer I would put in fresh flowers once a week
&gt; or so (make sure you keep the windows cracked a bit when the car
&gt; is parked...otherwise the flowers will bake). Alternatively,

Hmmm... What would your wife say if you put a venus fly trap in you
&quot;girlie man&quot; vase....   ;)
