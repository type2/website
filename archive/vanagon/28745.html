Subject: Trip to Atlanta a Success

howdy folks,

i left raleigh, nc last wednesday for atlanta to see some Phish shows. i'm glad
to report no serious problems at all! biggest problem was the passenger side
window roller-upper-handle broke. added a little oil when we got to atlanta.
did i mention it was cold? very cold. thank goodness i fixed the heater fan
before we left. also bought a ceramic heater for $28.00 that works well when
camped. plugged it in...temp outside was 28 degrees...we were wearing shorts
and t-shirts inside with windows cracked. very toasty. excellent investment.

tried to meet victor outside the Bridgetown grill across the street from the
fox but it didn't work...you still out there victor? it was COLD Sat. night so
i figured the 50mph gusts blew you away...hehehe blew my van all over the road
that day.

anway, my first out of state adventure with the van went without a hitch.

later,

jonathan ('74 van)
