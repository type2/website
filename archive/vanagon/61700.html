Subject: deep cycle btry: when to stop charging?

Just commandeered a deep cycle battery from our boat with which we 
normally run the trolling motor.  The motor has a little charge 
indicator letting us know when it's fresh and when it's run down.  

I wish to mount this in my Vanagon and have been charging it with a 
5W solar trickle charger, which has already taken it from about 8V 
(not charged since early winter) to about 11V.  

So when do I stop charging it?  Do the charge indicators measure 
voltage, e.g. do I stop when it hits about 13-14 V?  I don't want to 
cook off the water.
