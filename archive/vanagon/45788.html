Those of you who live in or visit Vancouver might have a chance to experience this 
grin.  You may see it on Caron's face right after she lays on the horn and screams 
obscenities out the window at someone who waited more than 0.5 seconds to go after 
the light turned green.

People tend to look at her with expressions of disbelief.  &quot;Can a laid-back 
hippie-type really be that high strung?!&quot;  When she sees anyone giving her this 
look she just returns it with the &quot;big sh*teating grin&quot; and maybe a hearty laugh.
