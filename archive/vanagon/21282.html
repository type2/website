Oh, My Darling Clementine
    (to the tune of &quot;Oh, My Darling Clementine.&quot; :)

In a junkyard, on a mountain,
  Rusting there beneath the pines,
Sat a sagging old Volkswagen
  Camper bus named Clementine.

Born a German, over yonder,
  Made her way across the foam,
Not at all the life she wished for
  In this new land, her new home.

There she sat, among the rusting
  Bones of cars from Yesterday,
Left alone and here abandoned,
  Waiting for her dying day.

      Oh my darling, oh my darling,
         Oh my darling Clementine,
      You will soon be lost forever,
         Awful sorry, Clementine.

Years ago she took a family
  Way out West and way back home;
Never once had any problems,
  Through the countryside they'd roam.

But the family grew much bigger
  Than poor Clementine could hold,
So they sold their loyal Camper,
   For a measly bag of gold.

There she sat, out in the weather,
   On the dealer's used car lot,
Through the snow of winter's freezing,
   Through the summer's burning hot.

      Oh my darling, oh my darling,
         Oh my darling Clementine,
      You were sold and left abandoned,
         Awful sorry, Clementine.

No one looked or asked about her,
   And the dealer didn't care,
So he sold her to the junkyard,
   And for years she's been out there.

Then one day, there came a youngster,
   Looking for some parts to buy,
Saw her rusted, faded body,
   Bought her from the junkyard guy.

Towed her home and started fixing,
   Taking time to do it right;
Worked a long time on her engine,
   Stayed up late into the night.

      Oh my darling, oh my darling,
         Oh my darling Clementine,
      You were lost but now I've found you,
         Not to worry, Clementine.

Brand new tires, and brand new braking,
   Stop the rust, and shine the paint,
Rid the field mice from the cabinets,
   Cause a Mouse Hotel she ain't!

Mend the canvas, and the fixtures,
   Make the pop-top work just fine.
When she's finished, she'll be pretty,
   A Beauty Queen, my Clementine.

Now she rides upon the highway,
   Just like when she was brand new,
With a grin between her headlights,
   And she purrs, like kittens do.

   Oh my darling, oh my darling,
      Oh my darling Clementine,
   You were almost gone forever,
      Now you're fixed and you're all mine!
