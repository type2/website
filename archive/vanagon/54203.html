Subject: Re: What colour is freon?

Sure sounds like auto tranny fluid to me.  If the torque converter 
seal starts going it can get slung ALL over by the torque converter (a 
condition I may be looking at right now).  I have in the past used a 
red dye to track down a freon leak, however. 

On the subject of refrigerant leaks, has anyone else noticed oil 
weeping from the A/C high pressure line in evenly spaced spots along 
the hose (about an inch apart, all around the hose) as if it were 
designed to do this?
