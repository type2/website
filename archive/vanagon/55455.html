Neal, 
I had the same problem with my 87 Gl.  I simply swaped the seats. Since
the seat belts are mounted to the floor the only thing that changed was
the location of the seat controls.  There is a small release that spings
up to allow the seat to slide all the way out of the track.  The only
problem was dealing with the grease on the underside of the seat.  Good
luck with the swap.  Let me know how it went.
