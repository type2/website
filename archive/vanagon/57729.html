Subject: 82 Vanagon Rear Seat - Lowering
Date: Fri, 28 Mar 1997 08:52:12 -0800

Can anyone describe how the rear seat is supposed to look after it has
been lowered?  For example I am trying to get a flat solid area.  When I
make it flat I have a 12&quot; gap between the engine cover carpet and the
back of rear seat.  Is this correct?  I have looked in the owner's
manual, Bently shop manual, and Haynes manual without finding any
information or pictures.
