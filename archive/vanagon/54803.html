Subject: RE: Bus Plus Fuss 

The information you've given jives 100% with what I've seen.

Luckily, the owner put covers on the seats, so they are still looking OK.

I can see what you mean about the quality of the upholstery, though.  The front seats have 
fold down arm rests.  The inboard armrests' fabric is actually showing wear from people 
moving to/from the front seats to the back.  I thought this was unusual at the time.

The owner even bought a second matching jump seat for the back.  So that, when the cooler is 
removed, the jump seat can be bolted down in its place, seating seven.

Except for the upholstery, this does seem a nice combination of every day utility and travel 
convenience.

Question ... Is there a basic non-GL camper that is not a Wolfsberg???

Thanks.

&gt;&gt;What is the difference between a 1986 Vanagon Camper and a Vanagon Camper
&gt;&gt;Wolfsberg 
&gt;&gt;Edition???
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm looking to buy a Wolfsberg Edition and I am not clear about how it differs
&gt;from &gt;a 
&gt;&gt;standard Camper.
&gt;
&gt;Ohhh Yeah it's me again..  :&lt;0
&gt;
&gt;Jim Davis is right, technically.  I have seen a owners manual for these models
&gt;and it says &quot;Vanagon Camper Wolfsburg Edition&quot; ( It did not say &quot;GL&quot;)  Let me
&gt;explain my reasoning behind the &quot;WWW&quot;name.
&gt;
&gt; It is a Wolfsburg...and it is a Westy (it's got the pop top)....and since it
&gt;doesn't have the sink/stove/all the cabinets...it is more like a &quot;weekender&quot;
&gt;version of the Westy. 
&gt;
&gt;hence the nickname - Wolfsburg Westy Weekender.... phew!
&gt;
&gt;(ya know what they say...&quot;old threads never die - they just get beaten to
&gt;death&quot;)
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, to answer your question, Michael - 
&gt;
&gt;This is the non-GL version of the Westfalia. I guess, since you were getting
&gt;less camping stuff, VW tried to make up for it by calling it the &quot;Wolfsburg
&gt;Edition&quot;.
&gt;This model has the pop top, and there is a full width sofabed in the rear,
&gt;because there aren't any cabinets along the left wall but one, which is in the
&gt;left rear behind the seat. These models all came with that lousy tan corduroy
&gt;upholstry. As I said before, the stuff doesn't last too long - worse than any
&gt;other Vanagon interior fabric. 
&gt;Everyone I've seen has all the seats ripped.  Since this model was a non-GL, it
&gt;had no tachometer or digital clock. There is no propane or stove. There is no
&gt;sink. there is a cabinet in the rear overhead, but if it has A/C that's where
&gt;the evap. goes, so you lose more storage space. It does, however, have a fridge.
&gt;A really nice big one (bigger than the Full westy GL's fridge) that you can
&gt;unfasten from the floor where it is mounted right inside the sliding door, and
&gt;remove it and use it in your garage or whatever. (this explains the reason why
&gt;these fridges are commonly missing on these models) there is a rear-facing jump
&gt;seat directly behind the drivers seat, with a reverse flip up seatbottom, so you
&gt;can put stuff under there.  The entire left interior panel is a tan molded
&gt;plastic, with a integrated table which folds out from the wall. there are also
&gt;cupholders (always broken) in this side panel too. there is also a little side
&gt;panel on the right, behind the sliding door, which has what's left of a
&gt;cupholder in it too.  As on the full GL westy's , the rear sofabed has storage
&gt;underneath. There are curtains all around, and it has the screens for the
&gt;windows. 
&gt;
&gt;If it weren't for the crappy ripped up interiors of these models, I'd probably
&gt;have bought one. 
&gt;you still have some of the camper options like the poptop and such, without
&gt;having to lug around all that extra cabinet weight. There's also alot more room
&gt;to put stuff in these than the full GL westy. I'd probably never use the stove
&gt;or sink in a Full GL westy anyway. 
&gt;
&gt;hope this helps,
&gt;
&gt;chris
