Subject: Gears &amp; Big Tires

After studying my European microfiche, showing all parts for the Vanagon
available over there, I have determined that the following final drive gear
ratios are available for the transmission:

37/6	6.17 (16&quot; vanagon?)	
35/6	5.83 (diesel?)	
38/7	5.43 (diesel?)		
34/7	4.86 (DEFAULT USA)  This is what all you gasoline people have.	
32/7	4.57 (?)	

If I am happy to drive the USA default 4.86 with 26 inch tall stock tires,
does anybody know how big a tire I can use with 5.43, 5.83, or 6.17 to keep
the same ratio onto the pavement? Or am I looking for 4.57? (I use a 27 inch
tall tire now [BF Goodrich 27x8.50 14&quot; All Terrain Radials] and this has
destroyed my acceleration and I want even bigger tires.)

Also, does anybody know what the largest size tire that will fit into a
Vanagon without rubbing up against the body? 

My wife hates bigfoot trucks. After I finish this project, does anybody think
she will notice anything?
