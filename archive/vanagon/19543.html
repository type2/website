Subject: Frau Blucher's Adventure?F?

I think that I shall never see,
a sight more scary than Frau B.

As driverless she rolled along,
Through a parking lot. Then BONG!

To a Ford she struck a blow
(she's always hated them, you know)

And then she stopped, in need of rest
And a Honda's side caressed.

But was Frau dented in the fray?
Negatore, nyet, and nay.

Yet Ford and Honda, I confess
Have owners who are humorless.

And much to Frau's and my dismay
These folks insist (small minds!) we pay!
