&gt; There have been one or two &quot;attempts&quot; to get an organized effort but all seems to 
&gt; fizzle away.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm planning to take some time off and go as far west as time (and etc.) will permit to 
&gt; join the trek.
&gt; 
&gt; It'll be a shame of the Eastern leg dies for lack of interest and support. I offered to do 
&gt; something to plan, coordinate or whatever but, again, everything seemed to just fade 
&gt; into a &quot;silent&quot; demise.

Pete,
	Here is a list of names and e-mails of people I have that are on
the East coast and have expressed some interest in GNATT:

Are you still willing to try and coordinate something?  It looks like
the West coast leg will be starting from St. Louis on Monday, May 29th
(after Busses by the Arch).  Let me know if you still want to do this,
and if not I will send this list to someone else...

Thanks,
	-Davidd
