Subject: 110 volt power inverter

I know that some of the bus folks have 110 volt power installed in their 
VWs, some with major enhancements (solar panels, multiple batteries, i.e. 
David, Sami).  Wanting to have 110 v for misc stuff (battery rechargers, 
etc), I was recently given a unit marked as follows:
R.L. Drake Co.
Miamisburg, OH 45342
Model DC-4 Mobile Power Supply
12 DC Negative Ground
650 VDC, 250 VDC, and -45 to -65 VDC
or 110 VAC (330 Hz) _at_ 150 W
There is an inspection tag on it that says Tested 9-17-68

The friend that gave it to me said that it was a power supply for a mobile, 
tube-type ham radio he had.

It has a normal AC type plug on the unit, and wires that fasten to the 
battery.  Is it OK to use this unit?  Isn't normal AC 60 Hz?  Would this be 
OK to plug a laptop computer into?

All help appreciated.  TIA.
