Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

&gt;        Driving to work one morning, I got behind a black Toyota Forerunner
&gt;with big lift, big tires, many extra shock absorbers. License plate
&gt;surround said &quot;NO, this is NOT my boyfriends 4 X 4&quot;. I couldn't
&gt;see the driver, the vehicle was too far up in the air!
&gt;Normally, I think such things are silly, but that time, I had
&gt;to say Right On!

This one I just have to share: I saw one of these trucks in North Seattle a
couple of years ago, with a license plate holder that said:
&quot;Yes, it IS a dick thing!&quot;

Didn't get a look at the owner though.
