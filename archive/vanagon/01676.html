This happened to me a couple of times. I found that there was a lot of
brake dust and grit caked up around the edges of the pads preventing them
from moving freely in the caliper. Now every time I change over from winter
to summer tires and back, I pop the brake pads out and scrape and sand the
gritty stuff out. The problem hasn't occurred again.
