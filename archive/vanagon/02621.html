&gt; Anyone who rebuilds the Solex carbs that came with the '72 and '73 buses

&gt; good power.
&gt; 
&gt; The best advice I can give on jetting is to find a mechanic you trust and 
&gt; let him/her fiddle with the adjustments for a few days. Admittedly, this 
&gt; can get a little pricey -- $150-200 if the bus stays for a week -- but I 
&gt; had a thorough job done two years ago and a recent Unisyn check still 
&gt; showed good-enough air/fuel adjustment. Yeah, it's a couple of bills to 
&gt; get this done, but it beats new car payments.

I agree with Emerson on both counts...  When I bought my Dellortos I got them
through a reputable shop that had dealt with them a lot.  The guy there
knew exactly what jets to put on for my 1800 engine so it was &quot;plug and play.&quot;
I've had them for 3 years now and have been pretty satisfied.

Apologies on my earlier post, I'm reminded that new Solexes aren't available
any more, I think my quote for them was for rebuilt Solexes.  I agree with
Emerson, though; why get new teensy little Solexes when, for the same money,
you can get a huge jump in performance?
