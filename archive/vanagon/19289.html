Subject: Possible Vanagon Sighting??
Date: Mon, 19 Jun 1995 09:18:05 -0700 (PDT)

Did anyone catch 60 minutes last night?  During
the story on Russian Nuclear Warheads, there was a brief
shot of the interviewer talking with a general and behind
them there appeared to be the sliding door side of a two-tone
Orange/cream vanagon bus.  Did anyone else see it.  I wasn't
absolutely sure it was a VW though.
