Subject: Re: parts

&gt;just wondering, i talked to my local VW dealership and they told me that
&gt;parts for a 1984 vanagon would be difficult to find, what is the parts
&gt;situation with vans, it should change by region, like in the DC metro area
&gt;(where i stomp around), it probably has half the number of vanagons that are
&gt;in calif. so parts would probably be a problem...  god, shopping for a vw
&gt;vanagon that fits your criteria (which is not too stringent) is tough.

If you are having problems, call Congressional VW on Rockville Pike in
Rockville, MD. Ask for Stewart Cook. He is the VW parts manager and a fellow VW
enthusiast. He has a Turbo-Corvair powered, chop-top '63 Bug and a '73? Ghia
convertible. He has helped me numerous times trying to get parts for my
Notchback. All around good guy,too.
