Subject: RE: 1988 Syncro Pickup

When I checked with US customs regarding importing a Westphalia, they said
the duty was 2.5%. Maybe trucks are still 25%, but perhaps NAFTA has
changed this.

If you track a rig down, Volkswage of America can look at the VIN number
and tell you whether the vehicle is EPA/DOT certified. If so, they will
send you a letter certifying this fact to show all concerned parties.

As to whether it will meet your local smog req's, that is something to
check into. I was told by a dealer that all late model Vanagons sold in the
US were 50 state certified (they met California standards, thereby meeting
all other states' requirements). I don't know if this is true for Canadian
VWs.

A general question. How coordinated were/are VW's US and Canadian
operations. For example, were 92 Vanagons imported into Canada, or is there
no such beast on the planet? When I was at the dealer looking at Syncros he
also told me that in Canada there is a Westphalia Eurovan conversion being
sold now that is not being brought into US because - to meet DOT
requirements - the rig would cost about $45k US.
