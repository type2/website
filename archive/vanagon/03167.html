&gt; Here's one for you: when we bought the camper five months ago it was

&gt; replaced them with a decent pair of Michelin X reniforced 185R14's onon
&gt; the back. I am curious if a) the mismatched tires would have had a
&gt; bizarre affect on the engine or suspension (they were well worn) and b)  apart from
&gt; affecting the speedometer slightly if running the 195's at the front
&gt; and the 185's at the back would create a problem (none so far I think
&gt; after 10k). 
&gt; 
&gt; BTW the 195's were not reinforced so I elected to leave them up front.
&gt; I guess the previous owner was persuaded that a larger diam. tire
&gt; would make up for its lack of reinforcement.

I wouldn't think it would be very good for your differential to be 
getting that kind of &quot;difference&quot; for long-high speed trips... for a long 
time!  Don't you think it might cause your gears to wear un evenly?

I dunno.
