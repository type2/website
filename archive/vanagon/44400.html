Subject: Re: Blinker Relay


&gt;&gt;Hey everyone, i just noticed that when i turn my blinker to the right it
&gt;&gt;clicks 2 times as fast as the left blinker [...]
&gt;
&gt;You have a turn signal bulb burnt out.

Or mis-seated in its socket, or with dirty/corroded contacts, loose or
broken wire, etc. I once nailed a wire with my wrench while working
on the V6anagon's throttle setup, and wound up with behavior like
this. I had broken the wire inside its insulation.   =:-O

But it basically happens when one corner's worth of turn signal,
decides not to do its job any more.
