Subject: bad fuel pump?

Now for my next round:

When the engine on my Bus is at operating temperature (not necessarily
*hot*), and has been sitting for a few minutes, it takes up to 30 seconds
of cranking before it finally sputters to life again.  After it catches,
I have to pump the accelerator a few times while it coughs and stumbles,
then it finally clears it's throat and is ok.

A curious thing I've noticed is that when I turn the engine off, I can
see bubbles running thru the plastic fuel filter, and after a few minutes,
all the fuel is gone out of the filter.  I assume what is happening is
that all the fuel is leaking back to the tank past a damaged diaphram
in the pump.  I haven't checked the bowl in the carb to confirm this.

Does this sound about right, or am I merely experiencing the mysterious
condition known as &quot;vapor lock&quot;?

PS--hope everyone had a great Christmas, and boy, am I sorry I missed
the Pizza gathering!
