Subject:       Re: 59 single cab question

 
&gt; Can I put my spare 1600 (70) engine into my 59 (If I make all the necessary
&gt; 6 volt conversion). The 36 hp sure looks tiny compared to the 1600. I havent
&gt; measured anything or actually thought about it a lot, but I saw a post were
&gt; someone said that this engine would more or less fit back to 55.

You sure can.  I just put my 1776cc into my '57 Bus.  Now I know the 
purists out there are screaming &quot;blasphemy&quot; at me, but it sure is 
nice to have the exrta power!

My only hangup was getting the proper starter which would mate with 
my flywheel on the clutch (since the 6v and 12v clutches have a
different amount of teeth where the starter hooks up.).
