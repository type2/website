Subject:  Re: Sigs 

I just wanted to point out that at least in my case, I only get the
first 30K or the digest. So those of you with the cute 10-30 line sigs
with the ASCII pictures of vans are stopping me from seeing 1-3 articles
from _other_list_members_. Ditto the guys that quote 30 lines to add &quot;me three&quot;,
and the elaborate trip reports that detail what you cooked for  breakfast, 
what flavor ice cream each kid had, and the model of each car you saw on the 
road. Mind you I'm may be the only one, and if the other members want this sort
of stuff, then so be it. However I suspect most are drowning in volume, and a 
little BW management would improve the value of this digest to all.

I hate to invite comments as it will cause more volume
Thanks

&gt;&gt; I would like to nominate Steve Maher for the 
&gt;&gt; &quot;Too Much Time On His Hands&quot; Best SIG files
&gt;&gt; award.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is there any competition?

&gt;Anyone who quotes a 50 line message, leaves a two line message and 
&gt;then has a 20 line .sig is a winner in my book!  :) 

&gt;Wait?  That's what I just did!  &lt;big friday grin!&gt;
