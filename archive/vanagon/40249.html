&gt; my girlfriend amanda and i have decided to head to the west coast this time

&gt; 
&gt; okay, i've got some questions...i drive a '74 retrowestie...running good atm,
&gt; never any major problems. we are talking several thousand miles of driving over
&gt; 2-3 months. should i do a rebuild before leaving? replace most parts? just get
&gt; a tuneup? has anyone made a major move across the continent? what did you do to
&gt; get ready?

If your compression is good, if it sounds good, and you've been keeping 
up regular maintenance, then just go with it.  If anything is obviously 
bad, fix it.  Christa and I did a 3-month, 15,000 mile trip last year, 
prepared for it as I'm suggesting you do, and our mechanical problems 
amounted to:
-split CV joint boot in Mexico: $7.00 part, afternoon's re/re
-cooked solenoid in New Brunswick, push-start all the way home, $30.00 
 part, afternoon's re/re (Couldn't find the part for &lt;$100 back east, so 
 we kept moving)
-cooked rear wheel bearings revealed themselves when we got home, $60.00 
 part, 2 days cursing  knuckle-busting re/re.

Not bad in my books.  YMMV, of course.

&gt; also, what parts would you take with you? if i start gathering stuff together
&gt; now, it'll be a whole lot easier.

Steve Johnson has a good list; I'm sure it's in the archives.  Be sure to 
bring regular maintenance items like fuses, valve cover gaskets, dist 
cap/rotor/points/condensor, a tarp, spare clutch and throttle cables, 
air, oil, and fuel filters, hose clamps, fuel line, and a good set of 
tools.  And several manuals.

[Can't help you with where to put a house full of stuff in your bus and 
still have room for girlfriend, dog, etc.]
&gt; 
&gt; finally, i live in nc, my girlfriend wants to go to oregon via the southern
&gt; route, i want to go via Vancouver. hehehe any suggestions on the best route to
&gt; take across country?

How about Oregon via Inuvik?  ;-)  You'll find cool stuff wherever you 
go, but if you swing through Vancouver, give us a call!
