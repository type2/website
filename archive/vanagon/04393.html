Subject: RE: all the vent questions

What's the deal w/ the FOUR levers?  My '81 only has three.
The manual has reference to four, everyone on this list has
four, but mine only has three!  Was the fourth a option?
It doesn't look like the third (that's the one I'm missing)
lever broken off or anything as far as I can tell.  But this
might explain why it's immpossible to shut off the air flow
out of the two top vents (defoggers).  And since the heat takes
about 15 minutes to kick in, I get cold air in the winters (summer
I don't mind).  And let me tell you - it drops to the low 50's
out here in the winter time.
