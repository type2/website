&gt;Any body got any adivice on replacing the front seats in 82 camper. I would like
&gt;something a little more luxurious. I read and article about a guy who had used 

I did this on a bus. Others on this list have, too. You may want to check
out junkyards with more recent vanagons. It's my understanding that later
seats (from '85 onwards?) are more comfy and they would be easy to install.
(Someone correct me if this is inaccurate.)

I suggest you check out the archives. gopher to
halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu/Miscellaneous/Vanagon and do a search there. (Hope the
address is correct; e-mail me if you can't get through)

Good luck!
