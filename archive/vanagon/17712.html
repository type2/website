&gt;Hello!
&gt;  I'm having a couple problems with my '77 bus.
&gt;
&gt;Next, the bus doesn't like starting cold.  It's having fuel delivery
[]

   I got my 76 Campmobile about a month before my son was born, so 
   it took a LONG time to get around to figuring out the weird
   starting problem I was having. Took it to Paul at C&amp;F Automotive
   in Costa Mesa, he was recommended by the guys at what used to be
   Datsa Volksa... He took a good look, noticed somebody had rigged
   a wire from the battery to the starter to give it a little extra
   kick, all well and fine except the wire gauge was too narrow to
   carry the charge. Also had a bad starter, also has a questionable
   center fuel injector (in the engine) which has yet to be fixed.
   It doesn't LIKE to start on a cold morning, but it DOES reliably
   start now. Stalls out a bit, but what the heck...
