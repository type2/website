Subject: Revell VW van camper model

Hi all. As I was looking through a flyer from a model shop, I came across
this listing:
        7633 Volkswagen Van Camper 1/24 scale
        Vw mini-van with detailed camper and interior. Accurate chassis.
13.75
        Available April 1997
That's all the info that I have. I am going to try to get a Revell/Monogram
catalog and see what exactly this is. The shop is :
        The Model Shop
        P.O. Box 68
        Onalaska, WI 54650      608-781-1864   Fax-608-781-7143
Once I get more info, I will post it.
        Mike Elkavitch
