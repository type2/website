&gt;    least up and down 2 large hills. (no joke this is how I found

What's the chances of the heads just needing re-torquing? Is this common at 102,000 
miles? Also, how about different types of stop-leak? Anyone have any experience with 
thems stopping VW Camper head-gasket leaks? If so which type? I've seen metallic aluminum 
(dry) types, liquid types, etc. Since the type of anti-freeze you use is so important to 
these aluminum head engines, I'd think the wrong type of stop-leak could also damage the 
heads?
