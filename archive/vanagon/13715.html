Subject: RE: Westy Flue Vent Cover

Jon,

It's been my contention (and some of you may disagree) that keeping  the flue 
lid on keeps the propane unit clean so that your fridge is generally easier to 
start and keep running.  when it comes to maintenance on the propane powered 
fridge, cleanliness is next to Godliness!  

If your friend can come up with a reasonable replacement for US$10.00, I'll be 
the first to get in line to buy a half dozen.  The biggest problem that we have 
in the Bay Area (N CA) is UV damage as the stock piece will harden and crack-up 
within 2-4 months if exposed on a daily basis.  Let me know what happens and if 
your friend comes up with a reasonable facimile!!

       Jon




A friend of mine keeps breaking the flue vent cover of his westy.  VW gets
something like $20 for these, as I'm told.

Is there a cheaper source?

What do most folks do?  Just don't bother?

My friend works in plastics molding and has thought of making a flue vent
mold.  If he did, would his vents be a marketable item at, say, $10?

Thanks,

Jon
