&gt; Solduc hot springs is a private resort. There is another hot springs thats
&gt; on park land -you have to walk about a mile though on an old paved road.
&gt; clothing optional. (at the springs that is.)

Rick,
	Can you give me an idea of where this other hot springs is?  I
think it would be a great place to visit (anything to do with submerging
onesself in water is good when camping :-]).  By Solduc being private, I
guess you mean that we can't get in, right?  I guess it must be like a
resort or something?

Thanks again for all your great comments - I am working them into the plan
right now.

-David
