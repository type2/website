Subject: bright lights, no one home?


A)  What are the differences between the following dual-filament
tail/turn/brakelight bulbs...#1157, #2057, #1034 ? They all seem exactly the
same.

B)  Is there a listing anywhere of the candlepower, or current draw,
or'candellas'(?) - i.e. the brightness of various bulbs?  There seem to be a
lot of very similar bulbs down at the local FLAPS?

Austin
