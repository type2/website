&gt; My suggestion is make sure if the leak is indeed from the seals of the push
&gt; rod tubes. If yes, replace the seals with teflon (sp) seals which resist

Viton, my man, Viton (not teflon)

&gt; much better the heat from the heads and will not leak again. If the leak is 
&gt; from
&gt; crank pulley seal then the problem is tough. The engine case has to be opened
&gt; to replace the seal. If the leak is not from the push rod tube seals and you 
&gt; do
&gt; not lose more than 25% (or as much as 1 quart) of oil every 3000 miles I 
&gt; think
&gt; you can wait until the engine is off the van next time to fix.
&gt; 

I'd agree with this, too... 

&gt; See what everyone else from the group has to suggest. Good luck. Welcome to 
&gt; join 
&gt; the list.
