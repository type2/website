Subject: Re: westie rear seat transplant?

if memory serves (and memory may be fuzzy) i remember chatting with a
fellow that had put a 70's era camper pullout bed in an early 80's vanagon.
i *believe* that the camper bed was either too tall or too short to clear
the hump of metal that covers the engine. what i am trying to say is that i
don't think it bolts right in, there may be some mod's to be made. how
important are aesthetics?

 FWIW 70's era WEstfalia's had two threaded holes on the top of the engine
compartment that the top part of the metal frame bolted into. i would guess
that your vanagon would nit have these and it may be necessary to drill a
few holes back there to anchor some bolts in to secure the back of the bed.

 &gt;Anybody have any experience transplanting the westie rear seat/bed assembly
&gt;from a type II to a vanagon?
&gt;
&gt;I've got an option on a used rear seat/bed assembly from a late 70s bus,
&gt;but dunno if it'll smoothly go in the back of my '83 vanagon.
&gt;
&gt;Ideas?
&gt;Thoughts?
&gt;Opinions?
&gt;Flames?
