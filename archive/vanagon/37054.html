&gt;That's why I tend to buy tools at Sears, although it's a roundabout
&gt;explanation. They don't claim they're the best tools in the universe
&gt;anymore, only that they're warranted for life. I've never managed to break
&gt;one. The selection is pretty good. And they keep honoring the warranty.
&gt;They keep doing what they said they'd do. That's all I ask of anybody; man,
&gt;God, or vendor. ;)

The Craftsman tools that are sold at places like Sears and Western Auto have
the lifetime warranty.  The Sears brand tools (la creme de la cheap) do not
have this warranty (but they look like they need it most).  My few really
nice wrenches are fully polished--ahhh that nice smooth feeling, no brittle
casting marks to bite into your palm--but buying a full set of those can get
quite expensive.  I've broken the heads on craftsman socket wrenches by
overtorquing them and I bent up a 3/4&quot; slide bar taking off a rear axle nut,
it looked like a big &quot;Z&quot; when I was through.  I have yet to break any type
of box type wrench, though.  Some day, after winning lotto, I'll proudly
step up to the curb and hail the Snap-on truck.  But until then...
