Subject: Re: Installed VDO/PSI Gauge = oil light on at idle?

Hi Charles -

Keep your sender where it's mounted.  There isn't enough of a pressure loss
in the length of the VDO hose you're using to cause the light to come on
prematurely.

VDO Dual Contact Senders, such as the one you're running typically come on at
7 to 10PSI, so you're probably running at about 5 to 6PSI right now.
 Considering the mileage (130K) on your engine, it's not surprising.
 Clearance between the bearings (and the oil pump gears to the oil pump
cover) have increased over it's lifespan so it's to be expected.  Although
the factory or Bentley does not say what the standard oil pressure at idle is
supposed to be, it's been generally acceptable to some to have about 7 to
10PSI when fully warmed up.  Problem is the VDO (and Stewart-Warner) senders
are built to kick the light on about then.  In a fairly new and well cared
for older engine, I prefer to have my idle oil pressure at about 15 to 18PSI.

No such thing as rebuilding a VW oil pump.  But you can bring new life to the
pump by removing the pump cover and remachining it nice and flat, taking the
gear swirls out of it that's causing the clearance.  Oil pressure should
increase a bit after re-installation.  Use a new gasket and use only
Gasgacinch(tm) to seal it as this sealer is very thin, but seals very well.
 There has to be a minimum tolerance between the gears and the pump cover for
the oil pressure to develop properly.

New pumps are easy to find from us or at any FLAPS.  Don't cornfuse the local
FLAPS by telling him you want a pump for a Wasserboxer - chances are he or
she won't find it in the books (unless they're looking in the right ones of
course).  It's the same pump used on any 72-79 Beetle 1600  (VW#
111-115-107BK) and they're not that expensive (especially if you don't say
Vanagon Wasserboxer ;-).....)  Whatever you do, don't get the 111-115-107AK
pump 'cause the gear tongue won't be long enough to reach the camshaft that
is to propel it (this pump fit the earlier 1600 dual reliefs with the 3 rivet
camshaft [You have a 4 rivet-dished cam] - only used in 70 and most of 71
Beetles and Buses).

Just keep your eye on the gauge and try to ignore the idiot light until
you've finished moving and had a chance to get to the oil pump.  Hope this
helps ya out.
