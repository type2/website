Along this thread, I highly reccomend going the way of Redline
MTL available from a lot of reputable maiil order places. It is
a premium synthetic in GL4 only formulation (won't void them warranties)
At $7 or so a quart it is a little expensive but compared to VW's
new synthetic fill $40/qt (is that shit liquid gold or something?)
it is reasonable.  I note your local parts store stuff is likely
GL3, GL4, GL5 rated even the synthetics, and I believe this ain't
a case of 5 better than 4 better than 3, but instead indicates the
wear inhibitor formulation.  For FWD applications VW has balked at
repairing transmissions running anything but a straight GL4 formulation.
MTL is correct for Bus and Vanagon boxes but for anyone interested
for a FWD VW, MT90 is the correct 75W90 formulation designed solely
for VW high performance applications.  Both forms are race proven by
most of the California boys and I can attest to the MTL really smoothing
out the old '76.
