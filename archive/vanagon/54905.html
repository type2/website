&gt; Another problem for me! Yea! :(  simple question: is the alternator in
&gt; my diesel the same as the gas models? If not, is it the same as a diesel
&gt; jetta?  The local electric rebuilder wants $90 for rebuilding it, but I
&gt; probably could get a used one under $50 (I hope).
&gt; TIA
&gt; Paul 82 Diesel WestyThe alternator electronics are the same, but the front bearing plate is 
different on the diesel Westy compared to the diesel rabbit.  I have 
taken a diesel or regular rabbit alternator and swapped the Front 
Bearing plates and had everything be just fine.  Sometimes the diesel 
alternator rebuilds  are tough to find.
