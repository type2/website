Subject: RE: Bus Wreck; seat belts


&gt;I had a &quot;discussion&quot; with my SO about whether they were wearing seat belts
&gt;or not.  She thinks seat belts are an automatic &quot;get out of death free&quot;
&gt;card.  They aren't.  They help, but when the other car parks in your lap,
&gt;there's not much you can do.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know how much seat belts would have affected
&gt;the outcome of this accident -

Yup, sometimes seatbelts don't help. And sometimes, when you play
Russian Roulette, the hammer comes down on an empty chamber.

In fact, if you ever go skydiving, your parachute might fail to
open. So why bring one along in the first place?

I've been in two slam-bang wrecks-- one a front-ender in a F*rd
van vs. a 3/4-ton pickup, the other a rollover-thru-the-guardrail-
into-the telephone-pole, after falling asleep at the wheel of a
'70 240Z.

After the first, I would have been in a wheelchair, and maybe still
would be now. After the second, I would have been decapitated by the
windshield.

But thanks to seatbelts ONLY, I walked away from each with a few
minor cuts from glass on my arm, and a welt on my knee where the
van dashboard came back about a foot, which healed in two days.

You really don't have seatbelts in your bus? You must be HOPING
the other car parks in your lap, which would indeed make the belts
superfluous. But just in case it doesn't...

My $0.02. Exit soapbox mode.
