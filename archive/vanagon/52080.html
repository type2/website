&gt;     about chains vs. cables.  Are there some brands/types that are easier 
&gt;     to put on than others?

        I've tried just about every kind of tire chain setup that I have
seen and I have some definite oppions.  If the snow isn't bad and you can
deal with sliding arround a bit then the cables are great.  The cables are a
little better than standard chains on hard ice but not as good as toothed
chains on hard ice ( by hard ice, I mean the clear ice that you can't
scratch with a coin) (studs help here too).  And the cable chains are so
easy to put on.

        I carry a set of cable chains in addition to three standard chains.
I use the cable chains under the following conditions.
                1. When I am required to put chains on and I don't feel that
I need them.  There cheaper so if I'm going to wear out a set of chains
driving on dry pavement then I'll do it to the cable chains.
                2. When I get stoped by traffic on a steep icy grade.  The
cable chains are easier and faster to put on.
                3. When It's ultra-ugly and I keep losing the front end I
will sometimes put a set of cables on the front tires in addition to a set
of real chains on the rear. (be very carefull doing this, if you loose one
on the steering axle things get real exciteing)    

 
&gt;       I have a set of cables for my other car that I dread to put on 
&gt;     because you have to reach behind the wheel and thread a nylon web 
&gt;     through a buckle to secure them.  This is not easy when your hands are 

        Get rid of them.  Get the type with metal beads on the cable  and a
simple hook on the other end. the adjustment end of the cable will look
something like this.

        ---*---*---*---*

        You hook the hook to the beads, It's easy and can be done with
gloves on.  This is the style of cables that heavy trucks use when they use
cables.

        If you regulary drive in a frozen hell you will also need a set of
standard chains.  I have found that the &quot;rings&quot; and other gizmos are
worthless.  The toothed chains are just too much work to put on for the
ammount of traction that they add.  The standard chains are also easier to
repair than the fancy styles of chains.  Get at least two sets of rubber
bands and put two bands on each tire.  It will run quieter and is less
likely to slap the side of your van.  I carry three standard chains so that
if (read, when)I break a crossbar I can just take the chain off, replace it,
and replace the broken crossbar when I'm warm.  If you don't carry a spare
chain at least carry a chain tool.  Then you can remove the broken crossbar
on the spot, instead of going &quot;smack...smack...smack&quot; for 50 miles or so.

        (This does not apply to cable chains)To put the chains on (watch how
the truckers do it)put the chain over the top of the tire.  Then tuck one
end tight under the tire.  Then move the van so that end is under and about
4 inches beyond the contact patch of the tire.  Then hook the back first.
then tighten the chain by grasping and pulling outward, then fasten the
front.  Then attach the rubber bands.  Then drive about 10-15 feet back and
forth about 10 times.  then tighten the chains again, and put the rubber
bands back on.  After a couple of miles tighten the chains again.
