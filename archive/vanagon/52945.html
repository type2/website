&gt;I heard that this is true for older tires, but that newer tire can 
&gt;withstand being rotated on the same rim and thus rotating in the 
&gt;opposite direction.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have recent information on this?

&gt;&gt;    Just remember that once you've worn a tire in a certain direction, that
&gt;&gt; you Keep the tire rotating in the same direction!
