You asked:
	

Third - On to the Fridge! Two questions before I start:

1. Does the &quot;don't level - do damage&quot; relationship apply to all three 
modes, or just to gas?

2. Are the clip on temp sensors mentioned in Derek Drew's 
&quot;Refrigerator Madness&quot; posting from 1994 still available from Radio 
Shack? Anyone have a part number?Third - On to the Fridge! Two questions
before I start:

	

I think the level thing applies to any mode you are running the fridge in
because the freon apparently actually boils and travels through the coils
(that rhymes!) and if it isn't level the liquid tends to get trapped in a
pocket in the coil which can, as I understand it, melt the metal and render
the whole thing junk!

TI'm not sure about the temp sensor thing you are talking about but I got a
digital indoor/outdoor thermometer from Radio Shack last winter on sale for
$14.00.  The &quot;outdoor&quot; probe I just stick in the fridge on the shelf and
watch the thermometer.  This comes in handy on long trips because you can
make sure your food stays safe.  I hope this helps.
