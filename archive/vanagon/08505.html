Subject: 2.4 Diesel 

&gt;Heck, I am getting pretty darn jealous of our friend
&gt;with the 1.9L Vanagon diesel.

&gt;Har, har, har. (Contented laughter.)

If you want *real* power, you need the 2.4 5 cylinder  diesel 
fitted to my Tranny. Gobs more power than that  weedy 1.9 :-)


&gt;manner.  I got to one of the traffic lights, behind a '88
&gt;Cavalier.  The lights changed to amber as the nice person in

Get it right, P.J. - An Opel Ascona. I used to drive one but 
fortunately not the one mentioned above.

&gt;(and if you want to rob my house while I'm away, note that 
&gt;I'm taking the hard-disk and hiding the Transporter.)

Ah, but the Tranny will be at *my* house over Christmas.  If 
anyone wants to cross my palm with silver, I'll tell  you where 
it's kept and put the key under the left front tyre!

    FOR SALE : '91 VW Transit 1.9 Diesel slightly used
               Complete with Bull Bar slightly abused


... with any luck P.J. won't check the list before he
    leaves so I'll have plenty of time to make a quick     
    killing.

    Happy Christmas all.

John Galvin
