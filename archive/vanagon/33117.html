I usually interpret a flat spot as being an rpm range that has no
power -- it takes forever to accelerate while in that range.  This
sounds a little different.

In any case, these symptoms are pretty close to what a Beetle I used
to have did for a while.  After lots of investigation, it turned out
that the accelerator pump tube (the bit that squirts the gas from the
pump into the body of the carburetor, it's visible when you take the
air cleaner off) was missing.  It was probably the crunchy noises I
had heard a little before this problem started....

Interestingly enough, I had the best mileage ever during the period
when that tube was missing.

Just another thing to check.
