Subject: Vanagon '81 Westfalia Over-The-Sink Light Bulb

Regular readers might remember that I inquired about a replacement for the
bulb in the single-bulb over-the-sink light fixture in my camper.  I
remembered that it was a GE790, but couldn't find a replacement.

I originally thought it was a regular incandescent bulb and replies from
V_at_L folks supported that idea.  I shopped all around auto and electronics
houses, but couldn't come up with anything.

The local VW dealer had a part number and wanted $54 for a replacement!!!
Just for the bulb!!!  Then I called Delta Six (original manufacturer  for
the Westfalia equipment: (818)760-4214 in N. Hollywood, CA).  Pete, the
Delta Six owner, quoted me only(!) $12.90 for the bulb.  Sheesh.  But as we
talked Pete gave me the clue -- it's a halogen bulb.

I remembered that as I ransacked the local Radio Shack rack, I saw a bulb
that looked a lot like the one I lost, but it was a halogen bulb.  I
thanked Pete and told him I might call back.  Then I RAN to Radio Shack and
picked up the bulb I had seen there, took it home and plugged it in.
BINGO!

Folks,  Radio Shack catalog number 272-1177 seems to be an identical
replacement.  All for the princely sum of $1.99!

Forsaking ideas of acquiring worldly riches re-selling Radio Shack light
bulbs, I'm sharing this with you all and hoping for a small deposit in my
kharma account.  Hope I've helped someone out with this.
