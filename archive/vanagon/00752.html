&gt; Thought about converting a gasoline engined Camper to turbodiesel.
&gt; BMW made a turbodiesel unit for the '85 Lincoln that should fit.
&gt; Rover makes some bullet-proof turbodiesels for the LandRover. They have

Why not just drop a Jetta TD in it - I've heard that getting a 
Rabbit/Golf/Jetta engine into a Vanagon is not that hard.  I'm currently
considering the possibility of getting a Westfalia with a blown engine
(read: cheap) and dropping a Golf engine in it.  I was thinking about using
a gas engine (like a 16V - 123hp, wow!!), but the TD sounds like a neat
idea.  Should have loads of torque - plus the possibility of 25-30 mpg, and
cheaper/more easily obtained parts.

Dave. ( wannabee :-) )
