Subject: Re: '64 Single Cab Value?

Jim,

I had to make a similar decision a while back when a '64 Single Cab became
availible here in the Kansas City area.  I decided that based on the condition
and completeness of the non-running truck.  If your's is running that would
make it more valuable.

I'd guess a grand, but if a collector with availible cash were to find out
about it, I'd expect it to go higher.

Richard
