Subject: Loose Armrests

Hi, 
     I have an 85 Westie with the captain's chairs with the armrests, both 
of the right hand armrests are loose and refuse to be 
tightened....they seems to be stripped on the inside but if they are 
not secured better may break off altogether. Any suggestions? Thanks 
in advance for any advice,
Rick
