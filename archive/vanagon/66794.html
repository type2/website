Subject:      test of VC

Hello-
        I was turning the 87 syncro around this weekend in a little snow when
I felt something like the rear wheels lose their grip and spin a bit (more
than one or two revs). I thought both front wheels were on pavement which
worried me - does anyone know a nice and relatively safe method of verifying
the front diff/VC are working? I thought of putting a front wheel up on jack
stands (well, the frame, not the wheel) and applying a about 100 ft lbs to
the axle bolt to overcome the friction of the seals surrounding the VC (I
remember someone talking about this). But if I understand things right, this
test will probably be inclusive as the VC will allow a little slip...

        Anyone in the bay area have a 4 wheel dynometer?

        Any other tests that might shed a little light on the subject? I
have been planning to replace the diff lube so I suppose I find out if the
seals dried out and cracked...
