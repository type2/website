	I Always Wanted To...
	Put a GTI engine in a 914! LOTS of money could sink into that
project! What a blast to drive though! I don't think you'd have
to lengthen it- 914 has a type IV with front air-intake space. People
put small-block Chevies and other exotica in the same place pretty
commonly. I've seen pictures of a 928 V8 in a 914.
	I'd take an 8 valve, 105hp GTI motor with the radiator in
half the rear trunk- take air in the stock grille and blow it out
over the rear axle/tranny. It wouldnt be too hard to still store
the removable top in the back over it, and you wouldn't have to 
butcher the front.

	For engine swap fans, Ian and I figured out how the gas
Rabbit engine goes into a Mexican Caravelle- its on its side at
45 degrees. The tranny bell housing is very different, and has the two
upper engine bolt holes at about 11:30 and 2:30 Is the Diesel Vanagon
the same way? One of those Mexican bell housings is DEFINATELY on our
shopping list for the next trip!
	Obviously the oil sump and pump-pick-up tube are different.
Would a Mexican gas engine sump have helped Stewart Hutton recently?
I guess we'll have to buy one of them too, since we can't get a
repair manual.

	Boy I'm writing a lot tonight- all while the computer does stuff!

	Bill
