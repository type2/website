&gt; After the engine was warmed up the OIL PRESSURE LIGHT came on for a

&gt; light came on again around 3000RPM.  The buzzer did NOT come on
&gt; either time - just the light.  While the light was on, it seemed to
&gt; glow brighter at higher RMP and dimmer at lower RPM.  I turned off
&gt; the engine after about 10 seconds. I looked at the information on
&gt; the oil pressure switches in the Bentley book and did a couple of
&gt; engine-off continuity checks and everything seemed normal.  

suggestions?  yeah, replace the Fram oil filter i bet you have on 
there now with a VW one!  cured oil light demons in my '85 tho the 
'87 i have works fine on either filter...  just a suggestion.
