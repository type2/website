Subject: Noisy rear brakes

My '91 Carat always has squeaky / grindy rear brakes, especially first thing
in the morning.  Occasionally, I get them 'cleaned' for about twenty bucks at
the local tire store.  (They say there's a big buildup of dirt on them).  But
that usually only lasts for a few months.  Other than the noisiness, they're
fine.  Any way to really fix this noise problem?  Anybody have a similar
complaint?

Sam
