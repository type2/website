Subject: Could someone in L.A. check a bus for me?
Date: Wed, 17 Jan 1996 13:57:38 -0500
From: &quot;Rodney L. Boleyn&quot; &lt;boleyn_at_scr.siemens_dot_com&gt;


I found a bus for sale in Los Angeles that sounds interesting.
Would someone volunteer to scope it out for me?  I'm in NJ.
All I know so far is that it's in the 213 area code, I don't
know anything more specific about its location, but will get
that info as needed.

Many thanks,
Rodney &lt;boleyn_at_scr.siemens_dot_com&gt;
