Subject: Suburban heater installation ('77 Camper)

OK, I know summer is coming, but I have this urge to atone for last 
winter's not-quite-perfect-furnace installation.

I know some of you have installed Suburban furnaces (Hi, Elliot...:), but 
has anyone done it in a '76-'79 Camper ???

I previously installed a furnace behind the passenger seat (mounted in a 
bench where I usually put my bench fridge), but now I'm convinced a 
Suburban can be installed immediately behind the sink cabinet where the 
original fridge used to be:

It would be installed perpendicular to the side of the bus. I'd have to
cut a square hole in the fridge cabinet, and vent holes in the side body
panel. On the inside, the furnace would extend to about flush with the
fridge cabinet, access to the electrical outlet might be tight, and the
lower table bracket would have to mounted above the new &quot;furnace cabinet&quot; 
which would be 10 inches off the floor. (The furnace measures
approximately 9.5&quot;x9.5&quot;x 21&quot; deep.)

Comments? Could anyone tell me where the propane line comes into the 
Suburban and any other design features that might be critical for choice 
of installation spot?

Thanks for sharing your experience.
