Subject: Vanagon fuse box

I finally broke down and added a diesel vanagon to my fleet of 
type 2's and now that the bad weather is upon me, I have a 
question about the electrical circuit.  I have discovered that if I 
have the windshield wipers on at any setting and I turn the 
blower fan to setting 3, it blows the 16 amp fuse within a second 
or two.  By the looks of the smokey/partially melted plastic fuse 
box cover, this has happened before to fuse location no. 9.  

I noticed that the VW owners manual never mentions using the 
fan on 3 for any heating or cooling needs.  Why is that?  Is this a 
common problem, or is it one of those electrical mysteries that 
can never be solved?
