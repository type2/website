Subject: Insurance

	Actually, the insurance companies do have an anti-trust
exception from the federal governement so that they can share
data. Each company sets its own rates (or doesn't get caught),
of course... I'm going to have to call my insurance company and
see if I can get at least some idea of the way their losses
stack up against premiums.
