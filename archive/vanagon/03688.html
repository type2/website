Subject: heaven ...

... someone actually ASKING me to tell more about my Vanagon.  Quick summary
of cosmetic stuff in addition to the various changes (gauges, etc.) associated
with the six cylinder transplant:
- elfenbein paint all over
- stripes; red and orange, about 3/4 inch each, 2 stripes out of the three
that come in a red-orange-yellow set.  Fit perfect in the &quot;gutter&quot; all the
way around the car.  Auto stores have another similar set in brown, tan, gold.
I used the brown and tan last Vanagon.
- fresh flat black paint on grill; Porsche badge mounted over VW in middle
- blank hubcaps (no VW stamp) with Porsche decals in middle
- dark smoke window tint on side and rear windows
- $19 JC Whitney rear wiper
- $85 JC Whitney sun roof, mounted over the second seat, so I get the air flow
without the glare.  Don't be scared -- you can do it if you're careful.  Let
the new paint job dry a few weeks, then get your saber saw and cut a 30x14&quot;
hole in the roof of your favorite car.
- speakers in bottom of front doors and front of back seat
- front seat rails painted flat black; front seats recovered in nubbly up-
holstery fabric
- Goodyear Aquatreds; 205/70-14
- black contact paper in long skinny sharkfin shape on the front of the rear
wheel arches, where the factory put gummy clear plastic
- Toy Box, in red and orange, about 2.5 inches tall on right rear window
- chrome trim pulled out of the window seals
- Volkswagen and Vanagon words on back painted flat black; trying to figure an
easy way to do a good-looking job of adding a second color to them.  First try,
on a spare set, freehand, was awful.
- undercoat sprayed heavily on inside of all four doors.  MAY have helped, but
you can still tell it's not a Mercedes.

Looking forward to hearing about other personalized bricks, loaves, etc.
B.
