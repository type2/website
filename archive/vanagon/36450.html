Oh do I wish the Pioneer was RHD, but alas it's a LHD.  Your theory 
is superb though.  Maybe my bus body got stuck in the corner for a 
while when someone forgot about it!  ;)

yes- i think standard bodys were used much faster- so they more closly
matched the VIN # than wierdo buses like 23 windows and RHD.  

WOW - check this out - i heard of a LHD 23 window with cargo doors on the
LEFT side.  Its a walk through seat 61, the kind with the drivers seat left
of behind the steering wheel.  Sounds annoying as all get out to drive, but
pretty neat huh.? If i see it, ill send Thom a pic to post on his webpage,
IHSD.
