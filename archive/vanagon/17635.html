Subject: Re: Gas Cap

&gt;
&gt;	I am sorta in the market for a gas cap for a '77 if
&gt;someone has one laying around that they would like to part
&gt;with in trade for $$.  Wally Mart sells locking ones that
&gt;supposedly will fit, but I really dislike llaves.
&gt;
&gt;	Also, I finally got my oil temp gauge hooked up
&gt;and working.  ITs pretty nifty to watch the needle go up when
&gt;you are going uphill, and down when you are going downhill.
&gt;
&gt;	Unfortunately, my gas gauge needle always seems to move down,
&gt;unless I am turning right :)

Hey Matt.  If you don't have any luck with locating a gas cap, let me know
and I can check with the late VW guy's wife (the one west of Indianola on
92) and see if he's got any.  She still has a lot of his stock.

Mike
