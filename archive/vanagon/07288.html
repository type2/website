Subject: blow-by to the limit ... what limits?
Date: Wed, 30 Nov 1994 00:26:51 -0700 (MST)

Hello vanagonites and Rick,
Has anyone here actually gone ahead and ignored the wicked blow-by and
kept adding oil to their diesels?  What is the eventual outcome of
blow-by?  At what point will the vanagon engine absolutely have to be 
rebuilt?  You might wonder why I'd ask such questions.  Well I would
almost swear that my blow-by pressure actually turns my oil filler cap.
Almost, but then again I could always make the same mistake not once, but
twice...
Thanks,
Stuart
