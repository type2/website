Subject: RE: Splitties from Heaven (long)


&gt;So it appears that I have a '62 or '63 23-window Deluxe Microbus in
&gt;exchange for a tranny that I would have sold for $50.
&gt;
&gt;I, too, saw the ad for the free '58 Bus in Oklahoma and was fortunate
&gt;enough to be the first to reply.   It must be my week, 'cause he said that 
he would
&gt;just borrow a car hauler and deliver that Bus to my door
&gt;
&gt;I can't get the SEG off of my face.  I'd better go buy a lottery ticket.
&gt;If I win the 55 mil, it's Busses for everyone!


Congrats, Bob! All I can say is, what goes around, comes around. Or,
bread cast upon the waters, always returns. Or, &lt;insert standard saying
here&gt;. My hat's off to you.
