Subject: Great Drives

Hi Folks,

I've started a &quot;Great Drives&quot; homepage dedicated to listing scenic 
drives around the US and potentially the world.  Anyone can submit a 
listing.  I'm encouraging any and all of you to visit at:
http://users.why_dot_net/ajax/gdrives.htm

Also, if you belong to any other auto related lists, please invite 
them to visit and submit any drives of interest.

VW Content?  We all like to drive our VW's on Great Drives!
