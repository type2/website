Subject: Re: Alternative engine swaps



To All:

The saddest swap I've ever seen is a 2 liter 32 valve DOHC Alpha stuffed into
the back of a late model Westphalia.  The work was reasonably well done and
the thing could get on down the road but it  was living proof that combining
a good chassis with a good engine can ruin both.

My personal choice would be to install one of General Motors fuel injected
3.3 L V6's in a late-model wasserboxer.  The torque curve and output of the
little V6 looks like they had a bus in mind.
