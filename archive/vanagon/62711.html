Subject: '85 GL won't start

I have a 1985 Vanagon GL that will start when it cold or has been
sitting for a while. If, however, I pop into a store and come out in a
few minutes, the starter motor turns and turns but it won't start. I can
smell gas so I suspect some kind of 'flooding'. Keeping the pedal to the
floorboard doesn't help, either. I find I have to wait for half an hour
before I can finally get it started.

Anyone have any idea what the problem is?

Thanks in advance....
