&gt;&gt; Seems to run a little bit hotter with the new heads (or else it's just 
&gt;&gt; the dino oil). I've changed it once already, but I'm going back to 
&gt;&gt; synthetic (probably Mobil 1 again) at the 150K mark (6.5K miles from the 
&gt;&gt; head install).
&gt;
&gt;Just curious - did you use Mobil 1 since the van was new (and hence 
&gt;the good shape of the pistons/cyls)?

I've used Mobil 1 since I bought the van (87K miles), and I've used Mobil 
1 on all of my cars (including 9 of my VWs) since the early-mid '80s.
The last car whose engine got &quot;old&quot; was my 412, but I used dino oil and 
didn't always change it when I should've.
Since I've been using Mobil 1 (any synthetic would work, I guess), I've 
never had an engine fail me, or even lose much compression. (although I 
haven't taken any of my cars or vans past 161K miles yet).
I swear the engine runs quieter (but I'm sure it's my imagination).

&gt;&gt; PS--I put new speakers in the front doors, which stick out 1/4 inch from 
&gt;&gt; the panels. I'm afraid to bend and break the window cranks, so I just 
&gt;&gt; loosened them a little and turn them carefully to avoid scraping the new 
&gt;&gt; speakers. Anybody have a better suggestion? Or should I warm the cranks 
&gt;&gt; up and try to bend them just a little bit?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;Autotech sells window crank spacer kits for $ 18, complete with 
&gt;longer screws;

This is great. Thanks for the info!
