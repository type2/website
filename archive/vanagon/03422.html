As an aside, there was a thread a couple months ago in rec.bicycles.racing
wherein a poster was reporting on a race that he had participated in and
encountered a non-participant who promptly decided to &quot;race&quot; with the poster
(both of them are on bikes, btw).  Anyway the poster called this
guy (the equivalent of) a stupid jerk in his post.
Well, it turns out that the &quot;stupid jerk&quot; also reads rec.bicyles.racing and
the resulting thread ran for a solid two weeks before slowly dying off!
