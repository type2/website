Subject: Air conditioner withdrawal

I removed all the ac equipment but the hoses from our 85 camper in June
rather than go through the expense and hassle of recharging/repairing the
system.
Although we live in hot and humid southeast MO, we have gotten by just fine
without it--relying on shady parking spots and the great &quot;natural&quot;
ventilation of the van.  The rear shelf that previously held the
evaporator/fan is now utilized by the kids, and distant vision through the
rearview mirror is improved.
The parts were not hard to remove, as the rear cabinet remains in place.  I
just plugged the holes to keep moisture out of the parts and stuck them in
the attic for storage.
Jim
