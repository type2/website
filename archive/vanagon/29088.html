&gt; I'm serious. Given a four-lane freeway, or blvd, the fast lanes are the two

&gt; 
&gt; I just had a conversation in the elevator, all of us born in N Amer (3
&gt; Yanks, 2 Canucks), and the vote was 3-2 that the outside lane is the fast
&gt; lane!
&gt; 
&gt; Two of the voters were born and raised here in Windsor and they disagreed.
&gt; 
&gt; So here's a Friday question:
&gt; 
&gt; Which is the outside lane? The fast one? The slow one?

&gt; South of the border, down Canada way
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
The number 1 lane is the fast one.  Lanes are numbered from the median 
out toward the outside lane!
