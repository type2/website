&lt;&lt;    John, you may want to check the archives.  I seem to remember
 someone pointing out that all the seats had the sockets for the
 headrests, just not the plastic holes.  I've never checked it out for
 myself.
  &gt;&gt;


this is correct.  ALL '80-'91 Vgons have provisions for headrests on ALL
seats..
