Subject: Vanagon Models, 1990 - USA


Vanagon Models, 1990 - USA
Jim Davis 9/96


Seven models of the Vanagon were built for model year 1990.  
These were: the base Vanagon, Vanagon Syncro, Vanagon GL, Vanagon GL
Camper, Vanagon GL Camper Syncro, Vanagon Carat, and the Vanagon Multivan 
(a new model this year).

Colors available: Pastel White, Flash Silver Metallic, Orly Blue Metallic,
Bordeaux Red
Metallic and Tornado Red. Not all colors available on all models.

Distinguishing Features:
There are very few exterior features to distinguish a '90 from the '89 
model year.  The '90 continued to have black window trim like the '89 
models. The 1990 has additional carryover features from 1989 including:
2 Black plastic front grills (common to 1986-1991)
Rectangular primary headlights, seperate square high beam lights
(common to 1986-1991)
Large VW logo in center of upper front grill
Large VW logo in center of rear hatch
Black plastic vents at the rear of the rear side windows
The 1990 GL, Carat &amp; Multivan (new this year) Vanagons had metallic 
silver aero styled bumpers with matching rocker panels and body colored
outside rearview mirrors. After an absence of several years, 1990 marked 
the return of the base Vanagon model that lacks many of the luxury features 
of the other Vanagons. 1990 was also marked by the absence of a GL Syncro 
model.

An eighth model, the Vanagon Carat Wolfsburg Limited Edition, may have been
built.  I have seen one 1990 Vanagon Carat in Tornado Red paint color with
Wolfsburg Edition badges, but the van's window sticker did not have a single
mention about Wolfsburg Edition.  The price on the window sticker was
identical to other Carats at $18,670.  I've had conversations with the owner
of a second Carat with WLE badges, but he is not the original owner and
couldn't verify the authenticity of the badges.  I have been unable to find
any differences between the Carat model and the WLE badged vans, with the
potential exception of the Tornado Red paint.  I suspect that the badges were
added sometime after the van left the factory, and that no WLE model was
actually made.  If you have any addional information on this subject, I would
appreciate hearing from you.  Please Email me at  SyncroHead_at_aol_dot_com  with
your comments.
