&gt;I've added small mudflaps to all 4 wheel wells, but they are not
&gt;nearly sufficient. Harry Yates has some info on how he made better
&gt;ones on his web page. Ideally the wheel wells should be a little
&gt;wider, so the tire is completely *inside* of it. Even with my narrow
&gt;tires (195/75R14) and mudflaps, the sides of the bus get sprayed. Is there
&gt;some kind of after market modification kit to widen the wheel wells?

yes ... but i don't think you want to know the cost. :(  VW makes some
additional full-wheel-well trim that extends the lip of the wheel well about
another couple of inches. it's plastic and screws (rivets?) on. i've seen it
in the Bildkatalog (picture catalog of parts from vw) and also in pictures
in magazines, usually on the german postal vehicles.

i don't know what they do about the sliding door (maybe the postal vehicles
don't have sliding doors?) ... cause if you extended the lip on the right
rear wheel well, the open door will hit it.

or do you really need to extend the rears?? the front tires sling mud/rocks/
whatever a lot wider sometimes because they are turning from side to side
(and stick out of the wheel well even more when doing so).
