Subject: camper fit in garage?

My wife and myself are (hopefully) going to finish buying a small house next
week, and I am hoping that my '76 Campmobile will fit inside the garage without
taking off the top... in the event it's a *little* too tall, does anyone know
what chances I have of economically (ha!) installing some kind of
adjustable/remote adjustable shocks to lower it to fit in the garage? I'd
*really* like to be able to put it in the garage!!!
