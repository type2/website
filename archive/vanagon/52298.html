&gt; A brief history (AKA What the heck is &quot;Wolfsburg Seating&quot;)
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; ---------------
&gt; In the mid 1987 model year VW introduced its line-up of Wolfsburg Limited
&gt; Edition cars that included a version of the Vanagon GL.  Most of the
&gt; distinguishing things that make up any Wolfsburg edition are cosmetic changes
&gt; (like special paint colors) and certain options becoming standard on the
&gt; Wolfsburg (like alloy wheels).  With the 1987 Vanagon, VW put a little twist
&gt; on its normal offerings and included a special interior arrangement that (for
&gt; lack of a better name) I call Wolfsburg seating.  This included a rear bench
&gt; that folds to a bed, a fold-up table on the driver's side wall and two
&gt; rear-facing bucket seats, in place of the 2-passenger front-facing center
&gt; bench.  These seats are located direclty behind the driver and front seat
&gt; passenger and have fold-up bottom cushions like theater seats.  Upholstery on
&gt; these seats was light gray pinstripe velour.  Between the cushions of the
&gt; front seats &amp; the rear-facing seats, a little storage tray snaps in.  For
&gt; maximum versatility, each of these seats can easily be removed by pulling up
&gt; on a little knob and lifting the seat out.

This carried through to the T4 Eurovan as their American MV or (European?)
Multivan.  Upholstery is different though...  We get a little storage 
area with two side areas with doors where you get an engine room.  When 
the bed is pulled out you can flip up the back of the seat and stow stuff 
underneath.  And I mean a lot of stuff.

When we had our '72 Campmobile it had one bed rear seat.  And one rear 
facing seat with a big box underneath.  There was a four legged stool 
&quot;Not to be used while driving&quot; said a label in three languages that went 
between the rear facing seat and the ice box.  This stool is often 
missing.  If that helps out the original questioner.  This is not the 
same as the MV/Carat/Wolfsburg seating arrangement.
