Subject: BIG VAN LOAD

Hello - since I'd last been on this list I noticed a thread re: big
hauls in vans. The week after my HS graduation in June 86 I drove a 66
bus from South Central PA (Chambersburg) to Dallas TX to just outside 
Missoula MT to deliver a vintage Civil War cannon to its new owner.
THe cannon barrel, wheels, and carraige components weighed in at about
1800 lbs. + me (about 110lbs) + gear (about 60-70 lbs) --- REALLY
PUSHING that 1 ton rating for the van. It huffed and puffed down
thru the Blue Ridge, Smokeys, across Texas, and up thru NM, Colorado,
Yellowstone and into Big Sky Country. WOW - quite a trip for a 17 yr.
old who'd never &quot;been West&quot;. The van? - on straightaways it was like
riding on rails, positively DID NOT want to stop after getting rolling,
had to give it plenty of breaks climbing hills- had to reverse up a
few real bad grades, but all in all no major problems. I know it was
the vans 2nd engine but I was amazed. Now that I've spent a fortune
on my 85 westy and its still sapping me weekly - I fondly recall the 
ease/ pleasure of driving the splittie. Regardless, I would not attempt
that trip with such a vehicle again - if I only knew then what I know
now!

Rigged up a hammock over the cannon stuff to sleep when I couldn't 
sleep outside on the ground or picnic tables.

Gosh, was this really 10 years ago?- Jim Hall
