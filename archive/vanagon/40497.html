Subject: old (i.e. pre 68) tranny ID question

Hi,

A friend of mine has three pre 1968 bus transmissions in his possesion but
doesn't know what year bus they came out of

Each of the trannies has a serial number and they are as follows

H4733849
H7336122
H7515873

if ANYONE has any information to correlate these trannies serial numbers w/
a model year the information would be much appreciated :)

michael
