Two things:

1) Have you checked the air flow meter with an ohm meter to see if it's
bad?  Make sure it's the air flow meter before you replace it.  Some
folks on this list should be able to suggest some other possibilities
for rough idle, sounds like that could be a lot of things--as I've found
out recently trying to figure out my own idle problems! ;)

2) Beware rebuilt air flow meters.  A rebuilt was put on my bus just
before I got it and I recently found out the CO screw didn't adjust it
at all when I needed a smog check.  I replaced it with a new Bosch--a
mechanic I trust said never go with a rebuilt, you're just asking for
it.  I was surprised at how much more power it added, and now the CO
adjuster is fine.  That rebuilt the last owner put on was a dud from the
start.

3) Make sure you price around different folks for the air flow meter.  I
had one place quote me as much as $500 for a new Bosch!  I ended up
paying $260 for a new one.  (I'm a 78, so I don't know what yours might
cost--check http://www.busdepot_dot_com/, he seems to have some good deals.
He's a good reference point on prices, at least.

Good luck!

&gt; 
&gt; Hello, I have been having some problems with my vanagon. It has had a
&gt; re-built engine for a year now. I drive it for a couple of miles and
&gt; it feels
&gt; as if i have the emergency brakes on! The brakes are fine, it seems
&gt; the
&gt; warmer the engine gets the more power it loses. I have retuned it
&gt; several
&gt; times and cannot isolate the problem. One mechanic finally told me
&gt; that the
&gt; air box was not responding to anything. I had a spare and installed
&gt; it. Now ,
&gt; plenty of power, but it seems to idle sort of rough, not too bad but
&gt; not just
&gt; right. I am contemplating getting a new Air-flow meter does anyone
&gt; know where
&gt; i could get one without robbing a bank? As they are very expensive!
&gt; One that
&gt; is rebuilt could be an option here right now, financial situation.
&gt; Thanks in
&gt; advance!
