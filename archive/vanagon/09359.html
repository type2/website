&gt;Well, if yer referring to the old stalling on the long drive at
constant
&gt;speeds, then you are referring to Technical Bulletin # 92-01 Vanagon
&gt;Intermittent Misfire which is for all Vanagon Digifant Fuel Injection
&gt;Engines.

Lucky me, I may have experienced this problem yesterday in my '87, or it
may just have been water in my gas (what it felt like to me), or - of
course - it may have been something else entirely.

For those of you who have dealt with this, does the car ALWAYS stall?
What I experienced was not a complete stall, but an intermittent misfire
on two occasions after episodes of extended (1hr plus) driving. Also,
the problem seemed to correct itself without me having to shut the bus
down. Each &quot;attack&quot; lasted about 5 minutes and then everything was fine.

It was quite wet here over the holidays and the bus sat undriven during
that time. I was also down below a 1/4 of a tank on gas, and the
temperature had dipped well below freezing (which might induce
condensation, no?). These factors combined with the symptoms lead me to
suspect water in the gas.

But then again, both &quot;attacks&quot; occurred after an hour of highway speed
driving.

I'll add some gas dryer today and see what happens, but in the meantime,
any guesses?
