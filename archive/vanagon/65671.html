Subject:      87 Syncro Westy for trade

     To list server members,

     I am in the process of looking for a 90 or 91 Westy to simplify my
     Westy needs.  I own an immaculate 87 Syncro Westy with 94K, zero rust,
     operational everything, stored every winter and has never seen salt,
     drive train has never been off-road and the interior has been rarely
     camped in.  I would like to trade for a standard Westy in similar
     condition.

     I have had advise from several list members (thanks!!!) and would
     still like to look for a 90 or 91 Westy to trade for with additional
     cash.  I believe that my 87 Westy Syncro is valued in the $13-15K
     range.  The 90 or 91 Westy is valued in the $9-11K range.  I do not
     want to let this Westy Syncro go without a trade for the 90 or 91
     Westy.  I know that this is a tall order but I've watched this list
     and its' members locate stranger requests!

     I haven't had to do any heavy duty repairs on my Syncro but I do
     appreciate this list and the members sharing their advise and
     expertise.  Keep up the humor.

     Thanks for this list.
