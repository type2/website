Subject: 71: Carb Problem Solved/?Checking  Condensor?

Otay, I was an idiot. I hooked up the preheater hose and virtually 
eliminated the problem with the &quot;flat spot&quot;/stall. Cool! er, warm. Oh 
well, the pre-heater hose wasn't installed when I bought the bus. It was 
easy to overlook, even though I did go out of my way to purchase the 
pre-heater channel. I just ASSuMEd that the air going into the engine 
compartment was sufficient for warming the carb. I assumed incorrectly!

Drove around for about 20 minutes and started noticing some &quot;cutting 
out&quot;...well, actually, just that feeling that she's missed on a cylinder. 
You know, a slight &quot;power burp.&quot; Well, I happened to be about 1/4 mile 
from an old VW mechanic I buy parts from every now and then, so I cruised 
by his shop...and he was there (which is unusual). He listened, drove the 
bus down the road, returned, and scratched his head. A few minutes later, 
he pulled the resistor off of plug # 1 and disappeared into his shop. He 
returned with and electical testor. 

&quot;Watch this. It should register about here.&quot; (I think 2 ohms resistance.)
He touches both ends of the resitor with wires coming from his gauge. The
needle doesn't move. Lucky for me I have spare plug wires in the bus. We
check the resistance on each of the spare resistors and replace #1 on the
bus. &quot;Now, if you keep having this problem, just keep changing these
resistors and it should go away.&quot; 

On the way home, I noticed a little more (actually a lot more) of this, 
so I'm going out to check the other resistors (and wires) and recheck #1.

These plug wires (and resistors) were relatively new. I have an ohmmeter, 
so I can check them all...as I will from now on when I buy new plug wires. I 
was wondering, though, how do I check the condensor? When I buy new 
parts, I generally trust them to be good. Chaulk up another one to the 
idiot factor--trusting things to be good, that is.

Thanks! Things are looking up.
