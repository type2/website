&lt;&lt; Has anyone mounted a CD changer in their space under the driver seat?  I
 don't have a battery in there &amp; thought it might be just right for a CD
 changer.  I'm thinking of doing this &amp; am wondering what it would
 entail. &gt;&gt;

I've mounted two (in two vans) in the space under the passenger seat.  Theres
plenty of room nuder the seat forward of the battery area.  You can cut out a
portion of the front sheet metal and have access to the front of the player
for changing CD magazines with no need to move the seat.  I figured the under
the passenger seat was the best place.  A front passenger can change
magazines easily while you're driving, or while you're stopped, you can reach
over and make a change from thr driver's seat.

Good luck,
