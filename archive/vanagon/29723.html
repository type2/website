&gt; To follow up to my own post.  I have had two responses already!  I did

&gt; this question was lost in my rambling.  Thanks, Jim

I was under that same impression, Jim, but I never had any luck doing
it...I removed the 11mm bolts after I had the wheels off, but the drum
seemed to be stuck to the hub part--big time! I didn't NEED to separate
them, so I abandoned the pursuit. (If it ain't broke, don't fix
it...unless you're trying to keep it from breaking on the road 8)

Thanks! Joe
