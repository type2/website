Subject: RE: Tire Recommendations Wanted

&gt;     Besides the FAQ on tires in the archives, Derek Drew suggested I
&gt;     check out tires in the slightly oversize 27x8.5x14 size (if you have
&gt;     the alloy wheels). This size is a bit hard to find, but they open up
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^ = $$$$
BFG 27/8.5/14 states minimum rim width is 5.5&quot; (up to 7.5&quot;), so the stock
steel wheels are OK, just barely. These tires will fit on any standard 14&quot;
van rims after '70.     Tim Smith
