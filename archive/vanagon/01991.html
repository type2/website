&gt;Orange is a BEAUUUTIFUL color for a bus!  Especially Orange and White!
&gt;*hmmph!* UGLY indeed!
&gt;(There there, Bobo, it's alright, you're not ugly like all those mean people
&gt;say... (even if you look a bit, well, stupid...))

but NOT International Orange!!! that's that hideous version of orange, like
they paint airplanes so they can find them in the snow.  Orange Orange is
ok, it's even the national color of the Netherlands, and it's also one of
the Porsche factory colors. and vw had an orange/light-something vanagon
back in 80-83. just like there's blue, and then there's Blue, there are
different versions of Orange.  even Bobo would have to agree with that. :)

besides, who wants a car that looks like the butt-end of a Coast Guard
airplane? (besides my sister, that is).
