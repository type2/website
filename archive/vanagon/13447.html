Subject: Re: Whens a vw camper not a vw camper?

&gt;
&gt;This months Volksworld has an article on a vw camper that is not
&gt;a type 2, its a type 1! It is a conversion called the `SuperBugger'
&gt;available from an outfit called Super Campers in Costa Mesa (?) in
&gt;the early 80s.
&gt;
&gt;A donor beetle is cut off at the base of the windscreen and fitted to
&gt;the front of what looks like a very small winnabago 
&gt;(well to me at least), to provide the car interior and camping 
&gt;facilities. The whole thing is 14 ft long, 79 ins wide and 84 ins high 
&gt;and looks very strange indeed!

I once saw one of these in a book. Sort of like a corrugated tin shack on 
wheels. Or a Porta-Loo :-)
