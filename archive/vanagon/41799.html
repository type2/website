&gt;Hi Folks -
&gt;
&gt;I was one of the people with a negative Bus Boys experience during last 
&gt;week's thread; in response to my comments they (Jim Thompson) contacted 
&gt;me and then shipped the bumper end cap that has been missing since last 
&gt;Fall.  I told them I'd tell the list when it arrived, and yesterday it 
&gt;did... so I'm now willing to give them another try in the future.  They 
&gt;certainly seem to have the best of intentions to serve the Bus/Van 
&gt;market, and a generally helpful attitude; hopefully their attention to 
&gt;detail will hold up in the future.

I had been following the stories (both good and bad) of the Bus Boys saga. I
also in the past had ordered a catalog from them. I even sent them a check
for the thing. They promptly cashed it and I never saw a catalog. I called
them and everytime they told me the new one was due out any day now and
they'd send it right away. 

Someone had posted the aol address for them so I copied all the messages and
sent them to that address. I got a message from Jim at the Bus Boys thanking
me for sending them the messages. Seems they've been lacking in marketing
skills. They run a small ship. Just a couple of guys. He assured me he would
look back over the records and try to make some things right that had
slipped by them. Looks like things have started already. I hope things
continue. I've been a small business man in the past. I know how hard it can
be to keep on top of things. I wish them well.

P.S. Still looking for that catalog :-)
