&gt; I want the battery to drive the fridge and lights and I want the engine to

Tony, don't worry about the heavy duty cables.  You only have to run one
over to the main battery and ground the other anywhere handy.  It is
worth it, 'cause I guarentee you will have occasion to want to crank
with that 2nd battery.  For most of a year I had a misterious starting
problem that required the help of bat #2.  I put a marine switch on the
back of the main battery case, but you don't have to go that far: Just a
cut out switch will do.  Plus all the other times bat #1 goes dead.
(Doh!)
