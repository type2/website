Subject: Preferred Pop-Tops '68-'79

On the '73 Westy I am working on, the canvas is missing and the edge seal
is foam wrapped in duct tape. The fiberglass is good, but not pristine. 
After pricing the cost of repairs to the present top from JC Witless
(~$400-US) plus re-gelcoating the fiberglass, I am thinking it's time to
roam the junk yards.  Since they will almost certainly price the top unit
intact at the same rate as bits off one, I figure I can switch years on
the top too and get the best design possible.  As a result I would love
your opinions on the following subjects: 

1) What is the &quot;best&quot; year pop-top in terms of design/comfort/dryness?

2) Does cutout lcation varyin by year or not? (68-79 breadloaf only)
 

                           TIA,
                           H Steven Dolan
