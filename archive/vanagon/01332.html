&gt; This brought something to mind, actually.   Last year we had the
&gt; compression done at VW for 'The Beast' and we were told that the
&gt; cylinders all checked in at 140psi (it is psi, right?).  Up to 
&gt; that point the only thing I'd read was Muir's book and he seemed
&gt; to think that 130 was pretty normal (if memmory serves).  Now,
&gt; being paranoid, is there anything that could cause excessive 
&gt; compression?  Should I be worried at the 140 reading?

Carbon buildup on the heads will cause higher than normal compression.
Nothing to worry about unless your van is pinging or &quot;dieseling&quot; after
shutdown.  In fact, it will increase your power and gas mileage.  If you
are still paranoid about it, you can remove the heads and scrape it off.
You might also try using some gas with detergent additives if you are not
already.
