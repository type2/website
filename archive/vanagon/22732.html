&gt; Next time it happens, feel the aluminum casting on the center section of the

may

I will definately do so. I know that the extractors are less efficient
at sending exaust through the heat riser than the stock.
I did send a piece of wire up the heat risers to make sure
that they are not blocked. Plenty of airflow when I blow through
them.

Ill give it a try.

PS. What does the number on a jet mean? Is it fractions
of an inch? Of a centimeter. Is 125 mean .125 inch diameter?
Or .125 cm diameter. I dont have anything that measures
nearly that small. I have an extra jet (stock) that I can drill
out, if I only knew the size.
