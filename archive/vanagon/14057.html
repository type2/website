Subject: Re: VANAGON digest 394

&gt;&gt;Hey I am up here in Edmonton, Alberta. I am about to put my 1991 Vanagon GL
&gt;on the market.

Seriously - is this legal for the U.S.?  We're in TX, not CA, so the
emissions requirements aren't as stiff, but what about other possible
snags.

Does anyone know for sure?

As the owner of a '61 with cargo doors on both sides, I'm more than 'kinda'
interested in this...
