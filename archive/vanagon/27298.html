&gt; As a Diesel Vanagon owner, I'm always interested in alternatives - four that

&gt; 1)  Replace with same (done that once)
&gt; 2)  Replace with rumored 1.9 or 2 L version 4 cyl Diesel (same tranny
&gt; interface ?)

Yes, the 1.9D bolts up to the same trans. that a 1.6D will.  I have seen 
an example of that conversion on a Vanagon.  The block on the 1.9D is a 
little bit taller, which requires adjustment of the exhaust system.  
Sometimes, I'm told, the engine has to be lowered a bit to clear the 
engine cover, but this might be only with the 1.9TD.  

&gt; 3)  Repalce with new TDI Diesel (same tranny interface?)

Good question.  Hopefully someday these will be imported to the US.  
There is a 5 cyl. version of the TDI.

&gt; 4)  New - Replace with 5 cyl  Audi Diesel or Gas (but will if  fit?)

I have been told that the 5 cyl. Audi engines do not bolt up to the
Vanagon diesel bellhousing, but I haven't checked it out myself yet. The
rough part on this one, I guess, is all the new mounts and bellhousing or
transmission that would be needed.  I assume it would be a tight fit if
the South African 5 cyl. Vanagons have their engine covers raised, as 
someone mentioned before.  Maybe the engine could be lowered a bit instead. 

&gt; So - Any of you that hear about these kinds of engine swaps - I'd love to hear
&gt; about it too.

Me too.
