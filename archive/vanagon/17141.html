&gt;	Okay only because I'm too lazy to dig up the info on my own, will 
&gt;someone tell me where RMMW is located. I'm in Colorado and am under the 
&gt;imression they are also. And, can you show up in person to buy parts or 
&gt;are they strictly a mail order outlet? Then again the Rocky Mts. go from 
&gt;New Mexico to British Columbia so I could be way of....

They are in Woodland Park, which is about 35 minutes West of Colorado
Springs, if I remember correctly. Was there last year, but they were
closed (Saturday). They're located a bit outside of town at 1003 Tamarac
Parkway.
