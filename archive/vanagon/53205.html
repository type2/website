&gt;I have seen some Caravelles (Vanagon in USA) including my 1984 GL with a

&gt;
&gt;What are they for? Dogs? Luggage? Decoration? The PO said they were for
&gt;nothing.

&gt;Hi Lionel,

I have a '89 Caravelle GL, and aluminum bars also. They aren't just there
for nothing but to avoid breaking your rear windscreen in case of big cargo
in the rear part of your van. That's it. At least, that what it's written on
the instruction manual.
