Subject: Snow Tires

I'm the new owner of an '86 Vanagon GL. It came with a set of Michelin XC
195/75 14 LT tires. Even though they're M+S rated, I'll still need real     
snow tires this winter. Does anyone have suggestions? I'm sure that this      
is a subject that has probably been covered a thousand times but, I'm new    
to Vanagons and to the list so, I could really use the advice. 
                                               Thanks - 
                			       Chuck Anderson
