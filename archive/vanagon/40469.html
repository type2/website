&gt;Having never before really worked on a wasserboxer engine, but figuring I
&gt;probably will some day, and still in search of a late model vanagon, I was
&gt;wondering if someone could comment on a range of life expectancy for head
&gt;gaskets on this engine.  I've looked at some of the articles dealing with
&gt;head gasket repair on this engine and figure it is something I would try to
&gt;tackle some day if I had to.  One vanagon owner I know with an 87 said that
&gt;he thinks the longest you can get is 60,000 miles.  Is this about right or
&gt;have some of you gotten more (or less) out of these gaskets?
&gt;

I presently have 127K on my syncro.  No leaks yet.
