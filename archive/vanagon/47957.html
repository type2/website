&gt; I figured I couldn't be the only one ..
&gt; 
&gt; It's scary.  I just got back from a long drive, Raleigh to Atlanta
&gt; and back.  The damn thing could of come apart at any time.
&gt; I &quot;fixed&quot; it by grinding the surface flush then slitting a piece of big
&gt; radiator hose and wrapping the tube.  This and two hose clamps plus
&gt; a plug in the heater hose got me back on the road.
&gt; 
&gt; I assume this thing is expensive.  So between now and late fall I need
&gt; to fugure out if I'm going to replace it or find another way/place
&gt; to junction in the heater hose.  I'm leaning toward buying a piece
&gt; of steel pipe, taping in a 1/4&quot; nipple and putting the pipe inline
&gt; with the big hose on the bottom of the unit.  Probably easier than
&gt; replacing the dist. unit and a whole lot cheaper.
&gt;

Frank,

The replacement distribution unit cost me $30 plus UPS shipping which 
was $15 up here to Alaska.

This is the type of problem I can well do without as I spend a great 
deal of time on remote logging roads out in the middle of no where. 

On one occasion last month I gashed a *NEW* rear tire 10 miles up one of 
these logging roads and guess what, yes, the wheel bolts had been 
replaced with *COMPRESSED AIR* and could I move them.....could I 
sh*tters like!  Ended up with the old Benbo photo tripod over the star 
wrench, bent the tripod and FINALLY got the bolts to crack....close call 
no AAA up here.

BTW.  On reflection I think that the rear table stand in a westie may 
fit over the wheel wrench for added leverage *either that or WATCH the 
bloody garage uses a torque wrench on the bolts*.

Chris,
