Subject: Horn Problem


The horn wasn't working on my 86 Syncro so I went to the FLAPS and bought 
a replacement horn. This is a generic blister pack, off the shelf
type of horn. It actually looks very similar to the original I'm replacing.

Here's the problem: when the horn is hooked up, the horn doesn't 
make any noise other than a single click when the horn button is pressed.

I tested the horn by hooking it directly to the battery. It &quot;beeped&quot; as 
expected.

I took some voltage measurements and found only 9 volts across the 
terminals when the horn button is pressed. Without the horn connected, 
I get 12.5 volts.

Since I'm a computer geek and not a EE, I don't know how to interpret 
these results.

Any ideas from the list cognescenti would be appreciated. I'm not adverse 
to buying a replacement horn from VW if that is what it takes to get
a working horn.
