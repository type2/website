Subject: Changing lock cylinders?

I have recently replaced the handle on my sliding door with a used handle.  I
can't figure out how to remove the cylinder so I can switch it with my &quot;new&quot;
one.  Is changing the cylinders a difficult process, because if it is, I can
live with it the way it is, but it would be nice, however, to be able to open
the door using the key.
