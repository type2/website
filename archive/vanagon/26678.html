Subject: Re: Cargo Hauls

Well, since everyone else is talking about thier big haul, I thought I 
would also.  All this stuff was moved in my '66... it really is a great 
utility vehicle.

I've helped more than one person move, stangly enough, my bus wasn't 
running when I had to move. :)
So, it's really nice being able to fit a full size mattress in the rear 
door, and then you can still pack the rest of the bus full of crap.  It's 
also real nice for large potted plants.

I've also move my full size fridge in it... no problem, lots of extra room.

Motor cycles?  Done them also.  The bigger ones need to go in diagonal, 
and you need a ramp and a couple people, but they fit.

I've also fit a new recliner in the box.  I told my mother that the couch 
wouldn't fit though.  :)
