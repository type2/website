Subject: Re: 87 Synchro CV Boots

&gt; 
&gt; I changed a boot on my 94 syncro and bought an original boot from my VW 
&gt; dealer. It was made in an hard glossy kind of plastic. Not all like the 
&gt; old ones, really soft rubber. I wonder if it is some kind of 
&gt; polyuretane? I also bought the special pliers to crimp on the steel 
&gt; clips on the both end on the boot. I can tell you soon if it is better 
&gt; than the soft ones.
