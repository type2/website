Howdy,
My problem has been that the tranny was stuck in neutral with what 
 looked like binding in the nosecone. So I yanked the nose off of my 
 tranny (while still in the bus ) and was able to get a look at the 
 shift rods and hockey stick. Because I had to do some twisting and 
 such to get the plate off I think what ever was stuck was knocked 
 loose. This is the situation- I can move all three rods with what 
 feels like proper pressure and move the engine in all 5 (4 front 1 
 rear) the shift link looks to be alright.
So what do I do now? I am thinking that as long as everything is out in 
 the open I will go ahead and replace the shift link. Is there anything 
 else I should do or replace that could be part of the problem? Where 
 do I buy this shift link?
Have a wonderful New Year!

Clay
