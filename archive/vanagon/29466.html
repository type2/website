&gt; pretty well. 

You thought wrong, at least according to my sources.  From the May 1969
&quot;Autocar&quot;, reprinted in &quot;How to Hot Rod VW Engines&quot;, I quote:

&quot;The request from Hitler to design a People's Car gave him (Porsche) the
chance to bring the low-drag, low-power (Beetle) to fruition.&quot;

It seems clear that without Hitler there is a good chance the VW Beetle
would have been stillborn.  I am not condoning Hitler nor trying to
imply that he was anything less than the murdering villian he was, but
he *did* play a significant role in the history of the VW.  I know how
tempting it is for people to want to believe otherwise.
 
&gt; &gt; and the same technology that destroy Nagasaka and Hiroshima cured cancers
&gt; &gt; in thousands of people and powered submarines that deterred war for many
&gt; &gt; years. 
&gt; 
&gt; If I remember correctly, among survivors of the bombings there were 
&gt; astronomical  cancer and birth defect rates.  And just think about all 
&gt; the people who could have been assisted with funds which were used to 
&gt; build up a nuclear  arsenal which is capable of destroying the planet 
&gt; many times over. Not to mention the Reagan-Bush national debt growth.

BUT, if we had used the money for humanitarian aid, we might have ALL
been blown sky high by the former Soviet Union in World War Three.
Shoulda Woulda Coulda.  Hindsight 20-20.  Armchair Quarterback.  Get my
drift, Dave?  BTW, my own mother is one of the ones treated for cancer
by radiation, and she's still with me.  I applaud the coming of the
nuclear age.  It's like anything else - abuse it, and it will hurt you,
but that's no reason to ignore it.
