Subject: Small torque wrench

Does anyone know of a company that sells torque wrenches that measure 
from 0-50 in-lbs? I need it for my camper, but I also need it for the 
stearing gear on my jeep. Chiltons manual says to adjust the stearing 
worm gear so that the stub shaft has 4-10 in-lbs of turning torque!! 
I know, it seems like almost nothing.

Thanks in advance
