Jim et al,

I counted three replies. Interest being what it is, time being 
what it's not...I believe this is an idea whose time has come...and gone.

Actually, I wouldn't mind doing PART of the work, but I don't have time to
do all the editorial stuff. Unless there's a lot more interest, I think it
was just a nice thought brought on by the Friday pixies.
