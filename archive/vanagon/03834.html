Subject: RE: '86 Vanagon Head Gasket Leaks

&gt;My '87 Syncro still has its original unleaking heads.  Anyone have any
ideas
&gt;on how to _make_ the heads leak in order to take advantage of this 
&gt;generous offer?  I'm probably due for new heads with 115K on the clock...


Yeah, and how long might one expect this offer last?

My 87 with 47k seems in fine shape now, but I'll probably be racking up the
miles a little more heavily than did the previous owner and it'd be nice to
know that I could look forward to a gratis set of new heads in a couple of
years.
