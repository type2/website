&gt;seats are in really bad shape.  I'm wondering if I can just take the swivel

&gt;greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

i checked into this a little for my 88 bus, wanting to make the passener
seat swivel. you CAN buy the plate and assorted hardware, but you will have
to UNweld the existing seat rails from your current seat, and weld in the
swivel plate mechanism, then add the seat rails to the swivel stuff.

what stopped me was the $160 and greater pricetag on that stuff, AND the
loss of most of the storage area under the seat, AND the problem in getting
to the battery (i.e., if you screw up the welding, your battery is stuck!).

so it CAN be done, but it's gonna take some work. if you can get the stuff
out of the junkyard without messing it up, and get your seat rails off
without too much damage to the wheelwell, it could be done.
