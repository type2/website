Subject: Westafalia coolant


Hi there,

We have a 1991 Vanagon Westfalia and I've noticed that I have
to replenish the engine coolant (yes I am using the proper kind)
more often than on any other vehicle we have owned (maybe every 3
fill-ups).
Is this a warning flag of any kind or is it just a characteristic
of the van?
Any help or advice would be most welcome.

Thanks,

Marcus
