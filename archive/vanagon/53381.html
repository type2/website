Subject: cold start
Date: Fri, 20 Dec 1996 18:04:17 -0500 (EST)

I followed that thread about the bad battery and the cold
starts, and it seems i am having the same problems.  When it
finally cranks over cold and starts running, it runs real rough
for the first minute or so.  
What special considerations are there for the cold start
mechanism on an 86 GL.  I will check the battery tommorrow and
check plugs etc.  I am heading to ohio from charlottesville, Va
and i don't want to get stuck in ohio.  
also...  How do you tell when your water pump has gone kaput
other than watching your temp go up and all hell breaking
loose???  My pump is fine, but it would be nice to be able to
detect it just from a puddle on the ground or something. 
thanks
seamus
