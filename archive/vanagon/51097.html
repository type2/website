Subject: Bellhousing AUDI 5 Cyl. to Vanagon Trann


During my investigation in sources of bellhousings which will
connect the AUDI 5 Cyl. engines to the Vangon trannies I got
this very friendly e-mail from VW South Africa which I like
to share with the list. Thank you very much over there in
South Africa=21

My next steps will be to get in contact with Steyer Daimler
(hey Syncronauts, that address you should know) and the VW SA
parts department manager. I will let you know about replays.

  Dear Helmut

  With regards to your query, I forwarded your e-mail to our Product
  Engineering Department and they sent me the following information:

  The part is locally produced by N.F. Die and machined by A.D.E,
  thereafter it is sent to Steyer Daimler in Austria where it becomes part
  of the transmission assembly which is in turn sent back to us to be
  fitted to the Kombi's.
  The part number is BCY 301 107A.
  I can put you in contact with our parts department manager if you are
  interested in finding out more about importing the part.

  best regards
