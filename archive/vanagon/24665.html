Subject: VW lurker Self Exposed

	My wife, Heidi, and I bought a 1981 Westphalia about 4 weeks ago. 
This is the first VW product my wife and I have owned.  Our primary auto
is a Subaru GL wagon.  My primary vehichle is a bicycle.
	We bought it knowing it needs work and that we would have to do
most of the work ourselves.  It has lots of little things and one major
problem(low compression on a rescently rebuilt engin.) I have already
replaced a cv joint and cv boots, replaced brake shoes and the seat back
on the drivers side. (I got the seat from this list.) I also have a gas
gauge that doesn't work... 
	It is great we've had a good time in it we've already taken it 
camping twice.  Our kid's, 4 and 2 love &quot;da ban.&quot;  I must admit my 
fondness for &quot;da ban&quot; is growing all the time.  We'll see how I feel 
after I try to figure out the compression problem.  

	Thank You.
