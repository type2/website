Anybody have any experience of Scat Enterprises, out of Redondo Beach,
CA?  They've got an ad in the current VW rags showing a couple of
interesting items.  One is a full, valve-cover-to-valve-cover engine,
including an oil cooler for $1300.  They also have complete kits (with
and without case+heads) for around 1/3 to 1/2 of that.

My current plan for the Gerbil is to buy a complete engine to get back
on the road, and then do a full rebuild of the dead engines I've got.
The final result would be one spare engine (the purchased one) and two
properly-built engines.

However, if someone knows that these guys have only been around for
three weeks or somesuch, I'd rather not think too much about calling
them....

Thanks much.
