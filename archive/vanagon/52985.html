Subject: Re: Non- VW Headlights

Some very high-end vehicles are now running HID (high-intensity 
discharge) headlamps.  This is a favorite topic of discussion on the 
BIKECURRENT listserv, which deals with bicycle electronics.

The price is very high.  Not only are the bulbs (Welsh-Allan et al) in 
excess of $100, with limited lifetime, but the electronics are very 
sophisticated.  The bulb needs a very high starting voltage, and then 
settles back into a lower voltage state.

Note also that there is a significant time to come up to full power.


&gt; Over the weekend I was driving along and saw a new mercades coming up
&gt; behind me with very well focused headlights that had a blue hue to
&gt; them.  They were really bright.  
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone seen them or know about them?  Could I get them or 
something
&gt; like 'em for my 86GL?
