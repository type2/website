&gt;Anyway, there`s this guy here in Sacramento that has done 
&gt;the unthinkable to his '54 barndoor standard:
&gt;
&gt;He lowered it, to the ground.  Put in a bug transmission and
&gt;some type of adapter thingy.  Cut and turned the front beam.
&gt;Took the 16&quot; wheels, and had them cut and widened, to 6&quot;
&gt;in the front, 8&quot; in the back.  He's running 40 series rubber.
&gt;
&gt;This is the same guy who, when I told him he was missing
&gt;his fresh air tubes (different bus) said &quot;So?&quot;

&gt;Thom, I agree with you wholeheartedly. (hope this doesn't start a flame
war) But it makes me OOOGIE when I see such a classic vehicle that is
well.._dot_destroyed like that.  Like my brother always tells me...&quot; The more
money you put into 'modifying' a vehicle into something that it once wasn't,
you get less value with tons of money. Stock stock stock :)
