     &gt;and if this is truly the way it was accomplished, how can they charge 
     &gt;an extra $150 for the modification (over stock rebuilt 
     &gt;kingpin/spindle assemblies)?  Of course, I know very little of 
     &gt;kingpins and the like and may just be nuts.  Could you out there with 
     &gt;this month's HVWs (and you know who you are) take a look and see if 
     &gt;I'm right?  TIA. :-)
     
     I've heard that you need to do some machining on the new setup because 
     some part of the kingpin binds or something.
