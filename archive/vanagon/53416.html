Try the archives
at:http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/vanagon.html
or ftp to lenti.med.umn_dot_edu in /pub/halfdan/vanagon
If you do not have Internet access try your local library.Even the branch
in my little hick town has a pentium set up with FREE web service.
I also  find a Bentley manual indispensable.
Good Luck
