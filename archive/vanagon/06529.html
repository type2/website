Subject: 12 Volt Halogens (was RE: generators vs. camping (long and tiresome))

&gt;3. Lighting of all types (inclding Halogen, flourescent, etc) is 
&gt;available for 12 volts and is very efficient.

Where does one find 12 volt Halogens? I didn't see any in the Camping World
catalog, but perhaps that wasn't their entire inventory.
