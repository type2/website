&gt;I have an '84 GL (non-Syncro) so I don't know if this could
&gt;be your problem too.  There was a recent thread on the
&gt;linkage and (usually, lack of) boot where shift linkage
&gt;enters the tranny housing.  This has a tendancy to get
&gt;crudded up over the years.  May or may not be your problem,
&gt;but it is worth a shot.  Lube all the linkage, check where
&gt;it enters the housing and clean/lube that.
&gt;
&gt;
I, too, solved a hard-shift problem on my '88 Vanagon that turned out to be a
hardened grease/crud mixture in the rear shift linkage.  It's really easy to
get at (at least on my '88).  The hardest part was digging the crud out of
the steel cup in which the nylon ball rests.  The crud (almost hard as rock)
was causing the nylon ball to lift up partially in the cup, instead of
rotating to allow the shift lever to do its thing.  The whole job took me
about 45 minutes, including jacking the van up.  It's sure worth a try, and I
plan on re-lubing that baby every spring and fall.  While you're under there,
check the rubber boot that's supposed to protect the linkage from weather.
 It may be cracked or torn, and will be easy to replace when you unbolt the
bracket that holds the shift rod.

Good luck!
