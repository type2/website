Subject: Roof rack?  BRIGHT colors?

1995 will be the year of the 68.  It's getting some
body work, new curtains, and a general makeover.  What
I'm looking for is a roof-rack (it's not a pop-top) for
it, to handle the canoes, the kid, etc.  Anybody got one
they want to sell?

Also, a call for opinions.  This group seems to always have
plenty ;)  so I figured this is a good source.  I want to
repaint the 68, top to bottom.  Right now it's a pretty dull
white.  I'm thinking about painting each below-window body
panel a different primary color.  The roof, posts, etc. would
be white again.  The rest of it would be, bright, shall we say.

My friends here (except one artist friend) think the idea is
indeed poor, but they also think I'm crazy to even have the VW's
Da Spouse has indicated a refusal to be seen 
anywhere near, much less in, such a vehicle.  Whaddaya think?
I'm still malleable on this one, so hammer away.
