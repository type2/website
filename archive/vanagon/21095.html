Dominic,

If you mean to use while you're camping, go for it; saves a lot of battery
juice.  But if you mean for general use, you'll probably be happier with
incandescents.  A combination of the two seems to be the best deal, plus lots
of little grain-of-wheat lamps right where you need a bit of light, such as
under the sink or in a cabinet that's dark even in the day-time.

The incandescents use an inverter to generate the high voltage and high
frequency needed to operate the fluorescent lamp.  The inverters aren't
especially efficient, make a little noise and a lot of radio interference
that can be hell to filter out of your sound system, ham radio, etc.   But if
your only option is running a gas lantern, go for the fluorescent; they're a
lot cooler -- and a lot dimmer.  

Be sure to tape the lamps into their sockets; they'll vibrate loose on you;
ditto for the plastic covers.  It's also a good idea to wind the power lead
through a ferrite bead to keep some of the conducted electrical noise out of
other components.  The hash radiated in the RF spectrum is a little harder to
deal with.
