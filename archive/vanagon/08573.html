Subject: RE: Hi all



I like the American V8 idea!  Although I don't think my big red 
tool cabinets are big or numerous enough for that kind of
surgery.

I was hoping for a fun winter project that didn't involve too 
much machining.  I'm newly relocated from California to Massa-
ice-and-slush-chusetts and while I'm keeping my puppy out of the
snow and salt I figured it'd be a fine time to supe-er up with
a bit more juice for those summer road trips up to Canada.

I've heard from many a non-vw driver that my baby's parts are
interchangeable with every other air-cooled vw made which I know
isn't true, but I figured there were probably a couple of engines
with the same mounts that can vault me over those hills with
a bit more gusto than it's original...
