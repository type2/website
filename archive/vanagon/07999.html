 One thing I need to reair soon is the heating system.  I'm missing
&gt;a hose from the front heater junction (just behind to front tires)
&gt;the vent under the rear bench seat.  I've been looking for a long length
&gt;of flexible duct to no avail.  Is this supposed to be some particular
&gt;type of dutct or will anything work fine?  I found some flexible rubber
&gt;hose, but it would have to be carefully hung and doesn't seem durable..

On my '73 this looked like the same cardboard/aluminium hose used to connect 
the heat exchangers to the fan housing (its a type 1 motor, BTW). You can 
get this stuff from any VW parts place. It looked OK but crumbled into dust 
as soon as I touched it. And it has ONLY been under a wet bus for 21 years, 
can't these Germans make anything that lasts?? :-)
