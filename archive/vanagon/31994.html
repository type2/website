&gt; This cooling thing is a mystery to me. If heat is understandably important,
&gt; how come there is no temp. guage? How does one know if you are running too
&gt; hot or for that matter, too cool? One fellow told me that it was like a
&gt; barbeque grill; just put your hand on it to see if it's hot! 

Specifically, check the dipstick.  Someone famous (Muir?) once said that
if the dipstick is hot enough that you can't hold it for more than a
second, your engine is running too hot.  Seems reasonable.  I've
verified that with my temp gauge.  At 180, the dipstick is cool as a
cucumber.  At 230, it's getting pretty hot.

&gt; Is an engine compartment seal important (naturally I don't have one)? I

Yes, it's very imprtant!  Get one ASAP.

&gt; gather that engine speed is most important since it may get hot in Atlanta
&gt; but obviously not as hot as in the western desert areas. Is it actually
&gt; nothing to worry about since VW didn't bother to even mention engine cooling
&gt; in their owner's manuals.? This is obviously novice stuff but i'd appreciate
&gt; any thoughts on the topic.

If the engine is running right and is not abused, it should never overheat 
(but is anyone's VW ever running right?  =)).  Adding some gauges is cheap
insurance against engine rebuilds, IMO.
