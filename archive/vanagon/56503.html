Subject: RE: Window tinting

I had 80/20 tint installed on the rear windows and 65/35 installed on the 
front door windows. This meets state law requiirements in Florida. Check with 
4-5 window tinters in your area about the law and pricing - opinions vary 
greatly. I ended up using my local VW dealers detail man who did my 91 for 
$120.00. Its been on for two years and except for a few nicks it looks like 
new.

Hi all,

Anybody have any suggestions on what percentage window tint I should get 
for my van.  I definitely don't want Limo tint.  I'd like to block the 
heat but preserve night vision.

Anybody have any experience in this area?
TIA

Thad
