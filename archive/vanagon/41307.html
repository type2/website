&gt;&gt;&gt;On Monday morning I started my '87 Syncro to discover an &quot;idle&quot; speed of
&gt;4400
&gt;&gt;RPM.  I drove the van for close to three hours and the problem was
&gt;&gt;consistant.  I've switched out the Idle Stabilizer Control Valve with one
&gt;&gt;known to be good and had the same problem.  Next I disconnected the pair of
&gt;&gt;wires attached to the Idle Stabilizer Control Valve and the van idled
&gt;&gt;normally while warm.  I suspect that this means that I have a problem with
&gt;&gt;the Idle Control Module or perhaps the throttle position switch.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I had this exact same thing happen this morning, but I don't have an extra
&gt;Idle Stabilizer Control Valve to check with.  If anyone could help, let us
&gt;know.


I don't have anything constructive to add, but I had the same problem with
my '87 syncro.  Whenever it was not in gear it'd idle between 2k and 3500.
Then one day it went away.
