&gt; I saw a twobus in Palo Alto - bizarre is to simple a word-- are there
&gt; many around?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  The twobus I'm referring to was built on Waverley Street in Palo Alto - I'll
   bet it's the same one. I did see anther two bus variation in Santa Cruz,
   but it was more of a piggy-back - looked like one of those old double-
   decker Greyhound buses.
