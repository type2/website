Subject: UNIX question -- vw related, sort of

Hey all,
I know some of you folks are in the programming biz, so I have a question regarding UNIX.  I'm adding some html files and jpegs to my web page (they are VW jpegs and html files).  I used to know how to do this, but I have forgotten how to change file permissions so that users accessing my web page don't get a 403 Forbidden error.  The help files on the computer are not very helpful at all.

It probably varies somewhat from system to system, but if anyone knows how to do this, please let me know so you can have more VW stuff to feast your eyes on.

Thanks,
Sean
