&gt;Pots?  Exploding?  Rubbish!  Dontcha know that those pots are baked in

One caveat, however... If the pot is WET, then steam pressure withing
the clay can cause the pot to shatter.  If the pot is dry, however, David's
absolutely correct.  The heat-holding power of clay is what makes adobe
houses so comfortable.

P.S.  I'm looking for a '90 Westie Camper Syncro in great condition, with
      less than 6o,ooo miles.  If you see one, holler.
