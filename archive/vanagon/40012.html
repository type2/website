Subject: 79 bus owners help!

In response to my own post about the crossover pipe:
CA Imports says the 79 crossover exhaust pipe DOES NOT make a U and
connect with the cat. convert.
Some people with the 81's and 82's say their crossover DOES make the U and
connect with the cat. convert.  

Anyone know for sure?

I know that elbow piece(where the U occurs) was used on the 75-78 busses...

Just want to know before I buy everything to find out I need an elbow piece...

Thanks, 
Paul
