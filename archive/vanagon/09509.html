So martha rubin says:
&gt; Steve:  face it, you married a camping goddess.  That Linda knows
&gt; how to rough it in grand style.  She had absolutely EVERYTHING anyone
&gt; needed, whether it be butter, eggs, oil, a twistie, dishwashing items,
&gt; etc.  We're going to set the next trip to HER convenience!

Hmmm.... and she doesn't really like camping that much.  I think
she just want to make sure we don't forget ANYTHING.  That's why
Dave Garths van looked to neat and clean compared to ours.  He
didn't have his wife with him this trip.

&gt; On the next trip, I'm going to enlist the help of the other females
&gt; to do a beer frisk - GAWD, you guys had SO MANY bottles.  How can you
&gt; drink that stuff in the cold?  I mean, there was glass and caps 
&gt; EVERYWHERE - that alley between our vans looked worse than skid row.
&gt; Disgusting!  ;)

Ahhh...my kinda a place.  Beer Alley!  ;P
