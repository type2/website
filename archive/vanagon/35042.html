Subject: Cooling tin orientation.

In my inexperienced beginnings of rebuilding my 1700cc engine(before 
reading Muir and the Hoover Sermons) I took of the cooling tins and 
engine covering tins without drawing pictures or taking pictures or 
ever really paying attention to how they go on.  I am not ready to 
put them back on yet, but when I am I don't know if I will be able to 
do it right.  Is there any book that gives a good picture of how all 
the tins are assembled? Is there anyway to find out how they go on 
without acting like the whole thing is a jigsaw puzzle.  Please help, 
Thanks.
