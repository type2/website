VW seems to have a thing for skis.  The Jettas came with a fancy trunk 
bag thing that allowed you to slide your skis into a bag that slid into 
the passenger compartment.  Only VW (okay maybe some others do at as 
well) allow you to put five foot objects into a three foot space.  I know 
about this because my brother uses the same thing for his fancy stunt 
kites.  Even the 'cheaper' models without the bag have the slot inthe 
rear seat.

Canoe?  Gonna have to be roof mount I guess.
Bikes?  The thing some here have said about the hitch mount bike rack 
sounds interesting to me.  I have a receiver hitch on my EV that could 
hold one of these racks.  I have few enough kids that I can take out the 
jump seats to give plenty of room on the inside for bikes and such.

I've amazed people at ferret shows by homw many cages I can slide into my EV.
