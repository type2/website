Bought my 83 aircooled for $4,100 (dealer) paid about $5,000. total cost by

This AM 's paper (Phoenix):
86 Westy auto a/c exc cond $7,800.
88 Westy exc condition, (4spd or auto not specified) receipts etc. $12,500

Saw at local car lot and recently posted the particulars
91 Westy auto w/AC and sunroof (12&quot;x12&quot; port hole thing) and factory alloy
wheels. Very nice looking. moderate to high miles. (88k) Dealer asking $19,900!

I looked at an '87 WestfaliaSyncro GL, very nice, 67K miles.$17,500. Is this
a reasonable price?  Do they really go for this much?

This sounds quite steep.  I bought my 87 Syncro (non-camper) in 1991 for
$9,200 and it's probably worth maybe $7 - $8K now.  I did see a 1991 Syncro
Westy several
months ago with 15,000 miles &amp; loaded with options for about $17 or $18K
though.
