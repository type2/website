The Vanagon diesel engine is not unique, but all the parts used to make it
fit in that body are.  The engine is the same used for the diesel powered
Golf/Rabbit/Jetta application, and there was a turbodiesel version, too. 
The engine mounts, heat sheilding, sump, starter, bellhousing, pulleys and
drive belts, oil pump or oil pickup pipe, flywheel, clutch (maybe),
transmission input shaft, ring and pinion, coolant plumbing, intake and
exhaust manifolds, air filter, and exhaust system are all different from
any other application.  The thermostat is the same, except a little hole
to let air bubbles out.  The injector pumps may be different, but they are
interchangeable if you change out the lever that connects to your
accelerator cable.  My plastic air filter housing cracked and cost US$170
to replace.  Starters have been expensive, too.  The turbo diesel version
must have additional differences, but I have never seen one so cannot
comment.
