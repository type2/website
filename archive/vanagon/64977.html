Subject:      Re: Westi window screens

A message sent said -
I have found a set of Westi side windows with the screens but no
screen material in them, so:
1. How hard is it to remove the screens from the windows?
- - - - - - -
It's been awhile, but I think one pushes up
on them and then they pull out.  Anyway, they
do come out.


2. Can they be rescreened once they are off?

Yes, but (I knew you were waiting for that)
It's a real pain to figure out how to obtain just
the right tension to prevent sags while the paint
dries.  Hot melt won't work.  I eventually ended
up using plastic model cement.  Try a little out
in a hidden (installed) place.  Some cements
will melt certain plastics.  Try it out on the
screen fabric also.

I used clothes pins against the adjoining sides
and opposite side to apply tension for gluing
the first side.  I think I placed something on
the glued joint to hold the screen onto the
frame (wax paper separator).  Then I glued an adjacent
side, allow to dry, etc.

Getting the screen to stay straight without sagging,
twisting, or wrinkling is not easy.  If you can find
someone who can do it cheap, do so.
