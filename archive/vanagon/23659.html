Subject: Re: air scoops on splitties


I seem to recall that when I put air scoops on my 67 camper (back in 1980
or so) that the oil pressure gauge ran a few pounds higher...that's due
to the engine running cooler.

Remember, if you have all of your engine and engine compartment
seals intact, that the only place that the air comming into the engine
compartment has to go is into the fan and out through the cylinders..
the fan normally creates a low pressure area inside of the engine compartment
in a Typ2 (and typs 1 &amp; 3 as well...typ4s do this automatically becauyse
they suck anyway (only kidding...no flames please)) and so air was
drawn into the engine compartment.

With the scoops, air is forced into the engine compartment under
pressure and at a higher volume, thereby leading to better cooling.
