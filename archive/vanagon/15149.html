&gt; &gt;Does anyone know if all 1990 Vanagons imported into the U.S. were California
&gt; &gt;emissions compliant?  I'm thinking of gettting a 1990 syncro in vermont and
&gt; &gt;it just occurred to me that I might not be able to drive it at home.
&gt; 
&gt; i think the separate california models were done away with back about 1983
&gt; .. that is, all vanagons imported into the u.s. were &quot;california&quot; models
&gt; after then. i'm fairly sure that all the 83-85 were, and even more sure that
&gt; 1986-1991 were all the same. however, make sure it's NOT a canadian model
&gt; .. that might cause some problems, fer sure.

While people are talking about emissions stickers...
Several months ago, someone mentioned here or on rec.autos.vw that
certain years of vanagons sold in Canada had both us and canadian
emissions stickers.  Apparently because they are already EPA approved,
it is relatively to import a Canadian Vanagon into the us...presumably
including Vanagon Single Cabs and Double Cabs.  Does anyone remember any
of the details of this?
