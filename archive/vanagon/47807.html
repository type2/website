Subject: wierd starting and a red light

I know this is a Vanagon list but I'm hoping someone out there can help me.  

I've got a '92 GTI.  For some reason every morning (6:00am) when I go to
work my 8V 1.8 liter engine sputters like it's going to die (might be
misfiring?) but doesn't.  It does this at 1000rpm.  Above 1200-1300rpm it
sounds fine.  If I leave a hour or so later for work it doesn't do this.
The temp at 6:00 is around 50 degrees or so if that helps any.  

Along with this weird engine behavior I can smell gas.  Again, I only smell
this when I go to work and when the engine goes wacko.  I haven't pinpointed
where the smell is coming from but I think it's from the vents.

Any other time I start the car these two things don't happen.  What's going on?

Another problem I have is with my temp warning light.  It comes on
occasionally when I get off the freeway and have to go slow or stop at a
light.  Even then it just goes away after a minute or so.  Sounds logical
that the temp would rise if I'm not going fast like on the freeway but the
gauge only moves about a millimeter.  The manual says it comes on when the
temp rises too high and/or there isn't enough coolant.  I've checked the
coolant and it's fine.  I don't have a clue what's happening here.  Please
help!  I fear I'm coming upon an impending disaster and I want to avoid it.
