&gt;&gt;If that fails, using the chisel to
&gt;&gt;help rotation with the &quot;blue wrench&quot; (torch) and the now familiar cheater
&gt;&gt;bar offer the normal options.
&gt;
&gt;Not so fast. How are you going to get a socket on the nut you have just
&gt;beat to shit with a mallet and chisel?

File. I had one that had been beat on with a sledge, once. Took me an hour
to file the lips off it. But from there the 3/4&quot; breaker and the six foot
water pipe took care of it. ;)

They have these intriguing 1&quot; drives at the tool store. They look to be
made to work on the Starship Enterprise or something. If the six-foot
torque ever fails I intend to avail myself of one of those drives, and
maybe a ten-foot cheater, and my wife standing on the brake. Those f*cking
nuts WILL come off there. ;) Also if you have seen one of those tools that
Clara is talking about, you can wallop those suckers with a maul or a
sledge. Inelegant but highly effective.

(Do other people with normal trucks have these problems?)
