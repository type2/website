Mine in my '76 was origional and worked fine when I sold the
car this weekend, are you using good OEM quality?  I did have
the cable rust and break once but replaced it with slightly
heavier bicycle brake cable and never had another problem,
I am in WV and it can get fairly cold, making proper warmup
important.
