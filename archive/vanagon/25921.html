Subject: 63 CREW FS IN SO CAL

Hi all,

Last week I noticed the following vehicle with a for sale sign in Carpenteria
California, near Santa Barbara:

On sign:
'63 CREW CAB
1600 DUAL PORT
NEW RADIALS
(805) 684-1340, ALAN

I also noticed that the color is white and the rear wheel wells had been cut
out.

Usual disclaimers, call him - not me.
