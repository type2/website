Subject:  vdo cyl temp sensor needed

thanks to all who replied to my query last week regarding the location of
the cyl temp sensor.  it appears that the mechanic who rebuiilt my engine
sort of lost mine, so i need another one, preferably before my 1,000 mile
trip this weekend.  does anyone know of a mail order source where i
could get one by this week?  i have none of the vw magazines with all of
the ads, etc.  thanks very much.
