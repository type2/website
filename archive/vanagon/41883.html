Subject: VW bits &amp; Engine for sale ('79 2L, FI)

I have, alas, &quot;lost my lease&quot; at my folks old garage.  They are selling it
and have asked me to clean it out.  Most of the parts can fit in my
basement, but there are two &quot;items of value&quot; I cannot move.  Thus I would
like to sell:

Bus related:
My &quot;spare&quot; engine.  It came from a '79 combi, it ran well for the 50 miles
from where I bought it to where I removed it, and the compression was good
then.  It has been in the garage for the last 4 years, unrun.  I was going
to throw it in a likely looking body, but that body went before I could get
to it.  The engine is complete from intake manifolds to heater boxes (no FI
gear, no muffler).  I am asking $600.00, but will listen to reason.

VW (but not bus) related:
My &quot;Mexi-beetle&quot;.  One of the recurring themes in the vw.aircooled newsgroup
is &quot;wouldn't it be neat to buy one of those spiffy, brand new Beetles they
are still making in Mexico and bring it back?&quot;  The instant response is, of
course, that after you modify it to meet current US safety and emissions
standards, you would wind up with a $50,000 Beetle.  Well, quite a while
back, I had this great *Idea*.  I asked the VA DMV, &quot;What *precisely* is a
car?&quot;  The answer is that the frame is the car, however modified.  Well, one
day I was bopping down this back country road near where I live and I saw
the burnt out hulk of a bug sitting by the side of the road.  Passed it for
three days running, and then saw a police officer tucking a ticket on the
front hood.  A short discussion later and the officer and I went to a pay
phone.  The officer called the registered owner and told him his choices
were basically to tow it now, with a $75 ticket or deal with me, and I would
pay the ticket.  A short discussion later, I owned the burnt hulk of a '59
beetle.  The body was toasted to the point that the roof had melted, but
after removing the body, the floor pan was quite solid. 

I have the pan, front axle, tranny, rear axles, and the (partially melted)
engine.  But most importantly, I have the title!  My long range plan was to
load the pan in my bus, drive down to Mexico, buy a new Beetle, and perform
the most massive (and quickest) restoration you have ever seen.  Per the VA
DMV this would now legally be a legal '59, and exempt from all safety and
emissions requirements.
Asking price for the floor pan and title is $300.00

Anyone interested?
