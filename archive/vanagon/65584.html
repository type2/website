&gt; &gt;  Looks like I'll miss the Jerome JAmboree as I couldn't get an
&gt; &gt;  appointment to have the CO adjusted until 9/22 and I don't want to drive
&gt; &gt;  it and risk running too lean and cookin the engine.  (It got messed with
&gt; &gt;  during the lastest non running episode)
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible to damage this engine by running too lean?  Would you not
&gt; see water temp go way up before any damage occurred?  Inquiring minds
&gt; want to know (before he damages his engine)!

&gt; P.S. Today I'm basking in the glow one feels after narowly escaping
&gt; death.  I'm beat up but alive!  I took on two burglers, one armed with a
&gt; shotgun, wrestled with one younger and stronger than me for a gun.  I
&gt; got the gun, he got shot.  If any of you out there do not own a firearm
&gt; for self defence, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?  Thanks for listening.
