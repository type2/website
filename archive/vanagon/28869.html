Subject: re:  Progress

interesting to see different opinions,  but I think it has been iverlooked
that a lot of the early improvement were good.   It is also showing
subjective opinions on whar you all like to drive.  Are there Luddites out
there?   What is the ideal state of technology?   No,  technology won't save
us,  it just changes things.  Some for better some not.

  I don't like smog,  duh,  and like higher emissions standards on cars.  I
drove a bus with f i for years, and liked it.   I find a single carb system
very functional though.  and there isn't such a mystery when it goes bad, and
parts aren't outrageously expensive.    I get better milage with the carb too
(?).

 &gt;Now I love splities, but the T2 is a better bus in all respects

whaaaaaat?   A bus is a type 2.    T2=transporter of all models (truck,
ambulance, 21 window, vanagon et.)

  Does this mean post 67?

&gt;The type IV motor was a revelation itself, and the Waterboxer made
&gt;the vanagon accelerate like a 914. From a couple trips with a friend,
&gt;I think the EV is even better. 

this is all subjective- if you need to go 75mph, fine.   But I know a lot of
people who have put a upright 1600 in their 72-79 bus when the type 4 motor
crapped out.   The little extra power isn't worth the expense and
awkwardness.  I'm happy cruising at 55-60 in my  old bus.   :-)  Gimme a
stock 1600 on an A case with new German cam and lifters and listen to tht
engine purr all the way to  Alberta and back.   I know some folks who have a
40 hp motor,  and take long trips in it, at 50- 55  I think.

And I like split screen buses.  I prefer the suspension, the king pin style
gives it better control on winding roads, and it doesn't have the spongy
feeling of ball joint buses.  I like the character, the feeling of them.  The
lack of plastics everywhere.  I like lots of little windows, and the art deco
design.
         
    They made improvements when they stopped making barndoors.  The brakes,
the cargo doors,  ventilation, standard rear hatch, etc,  but reduced leg
room.   Over the years trannys got better.  (Started as crash box - not at
all synchronised)   Motor size was bigger as the years went on.  (Brazilia
buses have upright 1600s   Does anyone have more info on them?   Anyone have
a friend there who could send a brochure from the dealer?)  In 64 the front
 door mechansm was  changed- doors don't pop open when crunched,  like on my
61.   Seat belts became standard in 66, but shoulder belts are better.  bla
bla bla  woof woof.  

   enjoy your bus no matter what year it is.  that's what it is all about.

                                 
                           O       O
