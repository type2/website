&gt; &gt; &gt; I am still suprised that these coupling are not offered as replacements for
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; spider-gears for positraction diffs in the aftermarket.  I'd love to have
&gt; &gt; three of these
&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of two diffs and one.

&gt;     WEll, If you put a VC on each Half shaft you would not need the
&gt;           differencial!!! Now that would be cool on both front
&gt;           and rear.!
&gt;  
Eric,  Won't work. In order for the car to drive they would have to be
locked up all of the time therfore there would be no differential
action. Todd
