RE: Power Window problem

     Duh, I had a brain fart and someone pointed it out.  It's not my van so I
could care less as long as I can get something in it cheaply and it works.
Someone said that the 091 transaxle is used in the '78 to '83 Vanagon, air
cooled, rear engine.  How expensive *IS* this transmission, and is there a way
to get out of this cheaply?  I need to get this van out of my garage and I need
to make it chep enough so the guy gets it quickly.  Please help.
