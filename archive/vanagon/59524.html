Subject: Re: Front end clunks at low speed.

John Olmstead, I think. Front end clunks. Others have mentioned
front end clunks.
Mine turned out to be passenger upper control arm bushings
on my '87 Wolfsburg. The mechanic found it. I guess they
get a big pry bar and horse the front suspension around and
try to find what is clunking. A big help is you can almost
locate the clunk by where the sound is coming from. It
sounds like exactly wher it is, under the passenger
floor board feet area.
Good Luck
