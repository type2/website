Back in 75 or was it 76 after I had my '56 beetle painted, I was
at the Univ's library working on a project for my MBA...as I was
walking out to the parking lot a large Cadillac pulled into the 
space next to mine...the door opened and I heard &quot;THUNK&quot;...

I calmly walked up to my bug, and there was a nice door ding
in the nice, fresh paint. I looked at the Afro-american passenger
and made some comment about being a bit more careful...and
he responded...&quot;Hey Brutha, its only a Vokswagin'...&quot;

I got in the bug...fired it up...warmed it up...waited until
my &quot;friends&quot; walked into the library....reached under the
driver's seat...pulled out my deerslayer knife...got out
of the bug....walked over to the right front fender...
pressed the knife into the fender and proceeded to walk
to the rear of the Caddy...

Needless to say there were metal filings on the ground by the
time I was done. As I drove away, I looked in the rearview
mirror and sighed &quot;Don't worry about it brutha...its only
a Cadillac!&quot;...


BTW, today is my '56 bug's 39th birthday...Beetle Model 113,
serial number 1 22 6 22 1 rolled off the assembly line and 
coughed to life in Wolfsburg Germany on 6 22 56 or as they
say over there 22 6 56.  As you will notice not only is the
serial number the same front and backwards...but it contains
the date of manufacture in both the German notation and the
US notation!


Anyway...next year I am going to have a 40 year birthday party..
and aircooled VWs will be invited to celebrate!
