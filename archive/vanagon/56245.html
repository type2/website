Subject: more on silver sockets


This just came to my type 181 thing mailing list.  I&quot;m thinking it
might be the source for the famouse silver sockets?  :)

OK Thing trivia masters I just came upon several NOS (I think) VW
cigarette lighters.  The part number is ZVW171109 They are Manufactured
by Casco Products Corp., Bridgesport, Conn. 06602 and Distributed by
Volkswagen.  Are these the real thing?  One of these days I'll have to
clean out all those boxes of old Thing parts in the garage.  Later Thing
owners.
