Subject: Re: Vanagon rear suspension


Gary:

I've (Tom) had one reply before yours; that writer suggested having 
the camber and toe-in checked, in effect saying that spring wear would
not be the source of the problem!  

It's been a year or two since I first began to have this problem and
at that time I had the rear alignment checked by a local tire shop.
They said they had performed the maximum camber adjustment (moved camber
adjustment slot to its endpoint) and that it was &quot;within spec.&quot;

I guess I'd like to know positively: can spring sag cause the wear pattern
I'm seeing?  (I've never messed with suspension much, but after reading
your post and looking at my rear suspension closely, it seems like the
answer should be &quot;Yes&quot;.)

I try to avoid VW dealers like the Black Death, but just for grins I'll
call locally and see what those thieves want for a set of springs.

&gt;         I have the same problem, and I think it was I who wrote
&gt; about the increasing negative camber resulting from sagging
&gt; springs.............and the concommitant inner tread wear.
&gt; 
&gt;         Before contemplating replacing the coils, check out the
&gt; price of the new coils for your friendly gouging VW dealer.
&gt; Up here they are about C$400 apiece!!!
&gt; 
&gt;         Let's talk procedure if you're willing to spend big.
&gt; 
&gt;         Remember Shakespeare said in Hamlet, something
&gt;  about whether..&quot;twas more noble to shuffle off this mortal 
&gt; coil...&quot; or just replace the tyres more frequently...........?   ; )
