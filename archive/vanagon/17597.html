&gt; I rigged my alarm so it sends out a 50 watt signal to my beeper on CB
&gt; frequency 27.195. It has never gone off, but it is nice to know I can walk
&gt; miles away from my camper into the woods and still be alerted if someone
&gt; breaks in.
&gt; 
&gt; The fridge uses no power but that noise you here is a little cooling fan
&gt; that will come on in hot weather. That little fan doesn't use enough power
&gt; for you to worry--it would take a week for it to drain much from your battery.

On the subject of refrigerator fans, I recently bought a small fan that
circulates air *inside* the fridge.  This one is nice, because by
virtue of the fact that it runs on two &quot;D&quot; cells, it requires no wiring
or cutting the inside wall of the fridge.  To give you an idea of how
much current these small cooling fans use, the makers of this fan claim
that it will run for 30 days on 2 alkaline D cells.  Since I'm going
to be using it for 29 days straight, I'll have a chance to test that
claim.  It is nothing more than a small motor with a fan blade with a
plastic housing, that sits on the bottom of the fridge and blows air
upwards.  I was gouged almost $20 for this from Camping World (I really
hate advertising for this place, but I didn't see this thing anywhere
else).  I am convinced (and I think Derek will agree) that this fan will
increase the cooling potential of my fridge by circulating the air inside.
I just hope it will work in the dark.  :-)
