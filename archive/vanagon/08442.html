&gt; 
&gt; check with a clinic/hospital or a vet ... i seem to recall they have something
&gt; that is supposed to get smells like that up. but also it might be clinging to
&gt; the rubber mat (not just the metal floor).
&gt; 
&gt; also check in the auto stores for stuff to clean seats (specifically, to get

Do try  joel's suggestion on a pet product.  There are a variety of 
products designed to neutralize such things, if it is indeed organic.  
Any large pet store should have a couple of choices.
