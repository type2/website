&gt;BTW, I think it is time to start a class-action suit against all 
&gt;insurance companies for sexual and age discrimination.  My rates are 
&gt;higher soley because I am a male, and am under 25.  Basing my rates 
&gt;on others of the same sex, soley because they are of the same sex is 
&gt;very descriminatory.  But that doesn't apply to the insurance 
&gt;industry, right!?  &lt;grin&gt;

You forgot marital status.  If you're single you pay more so if you a single
male under 25 you take out a loan to pay insurance.
