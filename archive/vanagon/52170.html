Subject: Re: mileage revisited

I drive a 1986 Syncro Westfalia, use 91 to 93 octane gasoline, drive 100
km/hr = 63 mph.
My consumption is 14.5 litres/100km = 19 mi/imp gal = 16 mi/US gal.

According to a report from S.Africa, 14.5 l/100km is normal at 100
km/hr. Any other Syncro drivers have better/worse results?

Larry
