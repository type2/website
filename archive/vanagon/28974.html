Subject: Re: fixing old heat exchangers

&gt;Hey now,
&gt;        This thread got me to thinkin' bout the bad exchangers I pulled
&gt;when I put on the Jtubes. Anybody ever taken these babys apart? I read in
&gt;Bently (I think) how to take 'em apart. Is this easy or?  How about buying
&gt;jtubes, and using the rest of the old heater box parts? In my case, the
&gt;boxes were still functional but the pipes were toast-smelled real good when
&gt;I turned on the heaters. Actually had a hole clean through one of 'em down
&gt;where they clamp to the exaust. So what's the verdict?

     Don't know, but the POR/paint over rust idea David
     suggested sounds a lot cheaper than, oh, $400 of
     replacement heater components from RMMW...
