Steve Says:

&gt;&gt;I actually had one mechanic tell me that the VW fuel lines &gt;&gt;are designed
to be used without clamps-- they grip tightly &gt;&gt;due to their flexibility, he
said, and therefore you shouldn't &gt;&gt;put clamps on them.

I'm almost 100% positive that VW didn't originally put clamps on them either.
 My 1600DP (all original) in my bug didn't have clamps on the fuel lines when
I got it.  I asked the original owner and he said there never were any.
 However, I agree with you that they SHOULD have clamps.  The first thing I
did was replace all the fuel lines and clamp 'em on good.  I don't want to
EVER have an engine fire.
