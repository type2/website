Subject: Cargo Floor Liner

Got my Sears Automotive catalog yesterday.  Dang, I wish I had me one of them
SUV things...

 One item caught my eye.  Cargo liner.  It's a heavy plastic tray that fits
over the back floor of your SUV or Taurus wagon.  I called Sears, and,
naturally, they don't make them for Vanagon.

 Does anybody?
