&gt; Thom, 

  Now that you've acquired all this experience and expertise, not to mention
  all this cool equipment, would you consider doing some rust eradication,
  dent removal and a beltline down paint job on someone else's needy bus in
  exchange for some frog$kins?

&gt; 	My SO ratified the paint selection, so I bought it yesterday, along with
&gt; an pressure guage that mounts on my paint gun ($20). It makes a big difference!  
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'm still working out the dents, in a sort of &quot;roughing-out&quot; stage.  
&gt; Once I have the major work done I'll go back and detail the small dings and
&gt; scratches, etc.  I won't start that operation prolly until I can yank
&gt; out all the windows and lights and stuff (ie no rain!)
