&gt; 
&gt; circlips, the joints themselves, and the boots, I just don't understand 
&gt; about this inner open washer he's talking about.  The procedure says you 
&gt; 
I think the inner sort of thrust ring washer circlip was deleted in the
mid '70's as specified in the Bently manual which went as far as to say
to remove it from previous cars as well, I don't figure Vanagons would
have ever had them but can't remember from our '86, only did the boots
once before I oops rolled it 2.5 times on some ice one day at about
68,000 miles.  Check a Bentley manual.

Hope this helps,

(incidently a Vanagon will do better in a roll at 45 mph than you think)
