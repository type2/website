Subject: Re: Clutch chatter

&gt;I had my clutch and all it's components replaced a few months ago but now it's
&gt;chattering when I accelerate.  What can be causing this?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Bryan

Clutch and ALL its components? I had my clutch done and did not replace the
seal in the transmission nor did I change the trans. input shaft pilot
bearing (in the centre of the flywheel).  There was no leak and why change
the bearing I thought.  Then not long after, the clutch started to judder
and chatter and eventually smell burnt.  I put off checking it until I had
to.  All that was left of the clutch by that time was a handful of dust and
some small pieces of metal in the bottom of the bell housing. . . the seal
went and my transmission lost most of its oil and just about seized up
(almost home on a trip) couldn't get it out of 3rd, but it did get me home.
The bearing chewed up the end of my input shaft pretty bad as well.

It was the VW dealer that did the labour, but I supplied the parts so there
was no warranty :(

Check your seal for leaks and your input shaft for scoring or wear.  I
didn't realize how much mine had worn down until I bought the new one and
compared them.  The seal is about $12 and the new shaft is about $90
(Canadian dealer prices).  Not sure how much the bearing is but it's cheap.


This may not be your problem but it sure was mine.  Since the van's been
off the road, I've been sentenced to driving a Renault . . . :(


Hope it helps
