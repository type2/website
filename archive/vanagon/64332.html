Mark,

If every thing went at once, I'd look at the ingition switch, and
associated power up relays.

&gt;Volks,
&gt;87GL died today while driving under full electrical load: All lights,
&gt;radio and A/C full cold. Would not start immediately, but later would
&gt;and drove it home. Now foll items apparently out: A/C: headlights
&gt;(dashlights work)/.
&gt;Batt shows 12.48V when van off:
&gt;Batt shows 13.28V when van on.
&gt;Stereo and driving lights work, where to start.
&gt;Any tips appreciated
&gt;Regards
