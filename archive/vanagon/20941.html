Subject: Re: Aircooleds and Airplanes

On this subject, has anyone noticed, generally, if your air-cooled runs
cooler in rainy (although not necessarily cooler) weather?  Perhaps a Rube
Goldberg solution for overheating during extreme heat is to rig up a
5-gallon water bottle, a 12v electric pump, some hoses, and an atomizing
nozzle.  Mount the nozzle near the fan intake, and voila! 

Well, perhaps the only effect will be a rust fan and housing...

&gt; 
&gt; I have been reading about the driving of aircooleds in hot weather
&gt; and watching the engine so that it doesn't overheat...
&gt; 
&gt; Now as we discussed last year, aircooled engines remind me a great deal
&gt; of general aviation airplane engines (aircooled as well). One of
&gt; the symptoms of overleaning an aircraft engine is the engine oil
&gt; temparature rising, and one solution is to enrichen the mixture...
&gt; 
&gt; .It seems that unburned hydrocarbons take heat away with them as they
&gt; are exhausted out the manifolds....
&gt; 
&gt; So, I was wondering if enriching the mixture might be a short-term
&gt; solution for those Arizona-hot days we have been experiencing in the
&gt; States...

&gt; p.s. My radiator fan actually came on for the first time this 
&gt; last week. Scared the dickens out of me. Now *that* is hot...
