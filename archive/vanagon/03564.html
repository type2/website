&gt; 
&gt; Is there a simple way to remove those 'theft-proof' VW radios without 
&gt; damaging the dash or radio (and without the 'secret' factory too&gt;?  I've 
&gt; got a '91 Westphalia and I want to tap into the antenna line to allow 
&gt; attachment of a marine band scanner to allow monitoring fishing vessels 
&gt; during a west coast trip next week.  I've meant to due this for a while 
&gt; now - it worked great with my 82 (easy to pull radio).  

	Well, you could do what I did which was pretty &quot;simple&quot; but kinda
	expensive:

	Put a Big-Gulp on the dash and drive. The Big-Gulp tips over flooding  
	the dash with 7-UP which seeps down around the ash(coin)tray and drips
	phosphoric acid into the stereo. The radio squeeks and dies and I have
	Car Toys remove it and replace it with Alpine CD-Changer ! :-)

	But, probably not, huh?

	One of the few missing pieces in the official shop manual is how to
	remove the music box.
