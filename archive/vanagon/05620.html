I just received an advertisement pamphlet in the mail yesterday from
a place in Greensboro, North Carolina that specialize in VW vans:


	Vantastics
	A Division of Liggett Enterprises
	829 Norwalk Street
	Greensboro, NC 27407

	In NC Call 1-800-VANAGON
	or 1-910-547-0144

	&quot;Your source for factory parts, accessories, custom modifications
	 and service for your VW van or camper.&quot;


The pamphlet includes a parts list with prices, here is a sample of two:

				Part #		Dealer		Vantastic
	Rear Hatch Struts	251-829-332	$50.00		$36.00
	Alternator/VGN/86-88	AL33X		$205.20		$152.60

Accessories include multi-battery systems, seven different awning systems
that range in price from $177.98 - $316.50, a rear I-Beam bumper and several
types of light kits.

I just called them up and talked to the owner.  They have been in business
for two months and they do mail order.

I am in no way affiliated with Vantastics, just passing on information
that some of you might find useful.
