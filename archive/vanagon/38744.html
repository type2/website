&gt; BINGO!  there are 2 universal joints in the steering linkage.  they 
&gt; are non-greasable and quite exposed to road grime.  the Front End 
&gt; shop in town here said that this is a common cause of on center 
&gt; stickiness and they *should* be able to match up a generic 
&gt; one once the old one is removed.
Let's hope so - I just priced the one at the rack for $ 230 CDN.
And the transfer gear case is $1226 CDN!
I plan to disconnect the shaft from the rack &amp; try to narrow down the 
source of friction tonight...
 
&gt; My '87 has 'sticky' steering right on center.    since the van i bought had 
&gt; sat a while before i got it i think the joints had corroded.  it does 
&gt; seem to be getting better with continual driving, in fact, it is just 
&gt; barely noticable to me now.  not enough to dig in and replace them 
&gt; for, now.
Mine looked corroded too - I jammed some moly grease into it, but 
doubt it did much good.
 
&gt; there is also a PN listing for the joint but i don't know how 
readily &gt; available it is from the dealer.
