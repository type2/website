Subject: '74 VW Thing - Illinois

&gt;From the Sunday, July 14 *News-Gazette* in Champaign, Illinois:

&quot;1974 VW Thing.  53k mi, new top, $3495 OBO.  NICE CAR!  Select Auto, (217) 
586-3160&quot;

Never seen it, would buy it myself if I had the money.  Champaign is 2 hours 
south of Chicago, maybe 3 and a half hours from St. Louis.
