Subject: EV paint cracks

Hello everyone,
As a potential EV owner, I've been noticing the mention of cracks at the 
A and B pillars. One of the early lessons I learned in the first bike 
shop where I worked was that if the paint on the bicycle was cracked, the 
metal underneath had been stressed. (Paint is not as flexible as metal.) 
Has VW or their dealers given any explanation for these paint cracks?
