Item A.  hello I am Jim

Item B.  haveing a prob. with an 85/2.1 waterboxer.  To start off with
	 the vechical itself was not much of an investment,  I knew about
	 most of the mechanical problems before I purchased it.  The auto
	 trans was loosing fluid while driving,  the trans was wet most
	 of the time so it was difficult to determine where the leak was
	 comming from. Now too add to the problem,  I had just dropped the
	 pan to change the fluid and replace the seal.  Seems that this 
	 girl just wont move now that she's got new fluids in her veins!
	 Plus it looks like all the atf I added was forced back through
	 the dipstick tube and is now in a nice puddle under the van.  I
	 am beggining to think there is a plugged valve within the trans,
	 I am just posting this to see I can find anyone to agree with me :)

Item C.  If in fact anyone can help me resolve my problem,  I will 
	 personaly dig through the garbage and dig out the oil filter
	 I had just replaced,  take a photo of it and send it to you.
	 trust me it would be worth the effort.  After I finally got it
	 off the engine all I could do was laugh  :)

Item D.  Sorry no sig,  I havent figured this out yet :(
