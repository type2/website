Subject: Re: vendor results, and ordering an engine


&gt;I don't remember the details of the warranty when I bought it, but it
&gt;certainly wasn't for five years.  Even if it was, I don't have the
&gt;documentation to prove it, so there's not a whole lot I'd expect to
&gt;get from calling them.
&gt;


Yeah, probably not, but it doesn't hurt to try.  I have found good souls
who will stand behind their work, even after the warantee has run out.  And
besides, there is always the possibility that they will cut you a deal on a
replacement.

More importantly, they should know about any problems with their products,
especially when they're going to lose you (and all of us) as a customer.
If the word is out that they're not up to snuff they should be told about
it.  I'm always willing to give a company an opertunity to NOT lose me as a
customer.

I think you should give them a call.
