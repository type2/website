&gt;This weekend, I happened into a store on the Sacramento River delta which
&gt;carried a product (and I bought one just so I could report to all of you)
I'd
&gt;never seen before.  It's made by a company called &quot;HeaterMeals, Inc.,&quot; in
&gt;Cincinnati, OH (1.800.503.4483) and is essentially a pre-made meal in
&gt;a box, but with a self contained, disposable heating unit accompanying it.
&gt;
I am in the Army National Guard.  The MREs (Meals, Ready to Eat) have an
packet that is the same thing.  They don't come with the meal, they are an
accessory.  Just add water and place with the food.  A few minutes later, a
hot meal!  They work GREAT!  They only problem is when people try to use them
as personal heaters.  If you place them against your skin, you will get
burned.
