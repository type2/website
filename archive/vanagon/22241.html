&gt;
&gt;      If you remember I posted about a week ago &quot;Instrument Illumination&quot;.
&gt;      Thank you all for the help now I have another one. I replaced the bad
&gt;      bulbs for the instruments but it still does not work.

are you sure it was the alu foil ? i found in my 84 rabbit that the
electrical contacts in the bulb sockets had lost their spring and were not
touching the bulbs anymore. all it took was a little sqeeze with the
screwdriver...
