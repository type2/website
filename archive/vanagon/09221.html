Hmmm....

Maybe it's coincidental, but I just installed a new fuel pump over the
weekend!  I thought the old pump was failing because after the warm
engine sat for 5 minutes or so, starting it again was very hard.  The
new pump didn't take care of this problem :(

I wonder if it is in some way connected with the 'rattle/bang' thin
oil symptom???....
