&gt; michael.heron} &lt;rant modde off&gt; I hope that travellers to Inuvik don't get hassled by Canadian 
&gt; michael.heron} customs. :(
&gt; 
&gt; So, what is there to DO about it?
&gt; Do the 4th and 8th Constitutional Rights apply?
&gt; Does anybody register a complaint, in their language, to the
&gt; appropriate higher authority?  Or does everybody just put up
&gt; with this abuse, so that it can be worse next time?  If that's
&gt; how we deal with it, then we deserve the harassles.

Our constitution is not applicable to Canada.

English is the appropriate language in Canada (or Frnch and English if 
Quebec is involved)

Time is the problem as I understand it.  There are things that could be 
done but not in time for the trip.  Although I feel truly sorry the trip 
got messed up, we US citizens have nothing to say about who Canada lets 
in.  It is their country.  We should be concerned about who the US lets 
in (that is we US citizens).  Canadian citizens on the list should be 
concerned about this incident since it is THEIR country that made the 
decision.
