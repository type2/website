&gt;So I'm using a Purolator oil filer and Castrol 20W-50 oil.
&gt;Synthetic oils are not an option at this time. My Vanagon has
&gt;133K miles on it and I believe that it's always had dino juice
&gt;so I'm not going to change now.

I may be overly picky on this but I, _personally_, wouldn't use anything but
OEM VW or Bosch filters (air, fuel, or oil).  Bosch is on my Westy.  Bosch
was on my '81 Rabbit when it was traded for the Syncro.  It only had
non-Bosch or OEM one time in the 152,000 that I added to the original
119,000.  That one time was when I was at Fort McCoy, WI and could not find
Bosch anywhere and had to get a NAPA oil filter.  It stayed on long enough to
get back to West Saint Paul when it was changed.  Right now the Syncro has a
(yuck) Ford oil filter on it (Ryan Ford changed the oil before it was sold)
but it will be changed this weekend for an OEM.  Bosch and OEM cost a bit
more but you don't have to worry about them bursting on you.  BTW the NAPA
came with that warning about bursting, too.

Oh, yeah.  No connections with the company and all that.  (Boy don't I
wish!!!!)
