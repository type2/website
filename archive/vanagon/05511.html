Subject: left overs for sale


My wife totaled our 86 Vanagon Westfalia and we have several parts left over 
that are for sale.  

Bra or noseguard(as my wife calls it) $20.00 This will fit any of the 
square headlight and thinner bumper models.

Screen for rear hatch $ 20.00 (This is probably a fortune from VW.)

Shipping not included.
