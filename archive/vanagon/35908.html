Subject: Oil Filter Wrench

	Someone mentioned using their oil filter wrench to
*tighten* the filter... All the filter manufacturer and engine
service manuals I have ever read say &quot;Hand tighten the Filter&quot;.
I suppose you could need a wrench to reach 3-4 foot pounds of torque,
say if you had no hands, or were very weak, for whatever reason.

	Seriously, they're designed to go on hand tight and I've never
had a problem, in 21 years of personal vehicle maintenance, with
a hand-tightend filter. 

	Just $0.02, from some loudmouth on the 'net,
