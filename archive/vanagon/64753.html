&lt;&lt; My '87 Westy has the same problem and I've been bugged by it ever since
 I've owned it.  I would venture to guess that all Vanagon Westys have the
 same problem and I sure would like to find a solution.  The idea someone
 had of glueing in pieces to fill in the gaps sounds fine but where can we
 get the pieces of trim ?  Junkyards ?  Westfalia ?  Does anyone know of a
 source for these trim pieces ?  How about a collective complaint letter
 campaign to Westfalia ?  Personally, I think Westfalia should come up
 with fix to get back their previouly good reputation, with me anyways !

Vanagons.
