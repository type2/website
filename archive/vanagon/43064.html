 this is in reference to the &quot;special gastank&quot;
 i forgot to mention that he did say that the gas tank he ordered
 had a &quot;hump&quot; in it, so that it would clear the diesel bell housing.
 maybe this &quot;special tank&quot; is a VW part that is for use with the
 diesel syncro, if there was such a thing...

 anyway: what's this about a porsche water cooled six
 i guess i better start saving now?

 sorry for any disrespect to all those &quot;syncronauts&quot;
 i guess i just wish my crewcab was a syncro!
later
