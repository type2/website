Subject: more pics available on the web
Date: Tue, 24 Jan 1995 18:53:31 -0800 (PST)

Hi all,
	I just got done scanning some more pictures.  The ftp site
(bolo.nosc_dot_mil) and the web page (http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw)
have been updated.  The main point of interest is the addition of a
&quot;Synchro Madness&quot; page with 11 pictures sent to me by Derek Drew of his
87 Westy Synchro in various states of stuck-ed-ness in the wilderness.
I also put in a few pictures of the interior of my camper so you'z all
can stop wondering what a Safare Custom Camper looks like.  :)

	As usual, the pictures are available via anonymous ftp in gif
and tiff format (gifs are smaller, tiffs better quality) and the web
page has thumbnail previews for you folks at home on modems.  I hope
to get to the rest of the pfeiffer pics later this week.  Enjoy!

-David
