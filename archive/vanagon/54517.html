Subject: Child cot in Vanagon

Hi Volks,
   I saw this question on the list and had to respond.

&gt;Has anyone else ever seen a childs cot for a Vanagon Westy?
I didn't know they existed.

As far as I know, they do not.  However, I have put one in my '82.  I found
a good cot with one pole from '73 and had a good  pole from a '79 and
combined the 2.  I didn't put much effort into the job.  Basically my wife
and I held the poles up and found where the fit best.  Marked the spot, put
of the brakets and TaDaaa, a bed.  I use the slider (from '79) for the
front pole. It can safely be extended out past the fixed poles, making it
fit the front window better.  Anyway, there isn't alot of room between the
cot and the roof of the camper (about 2 feet), but my daughter lovers it.
There is a space on each end of the cot that I neatly fill with the seats.
The headrest stick up nicely filling the space. One problem I have
encounted is the curtain.  I can't bring myself to cut it, so I place dark
blanks (until I get something better) on the outside of the front windows.
I hood them in place with the doors.  Well, thats my 2 cents.  Take care.
