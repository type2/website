Gerry,
&quot;clattering&quot; is exactly the right word to describe the valve noise when
you have collapsed lifters, so that's where my vote goes.  I would
recommend:

1.  Change the oil if by any chance it could need it.

2.  Add some kind of oil-improving/cleaning compound.  Maybe people have
suggestions on their favorite.
