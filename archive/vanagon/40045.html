Subject: Re: What has happened to gasoline prices?

&gt;Here in San Diego, CA, gasoline has jumped up to $1.50 per gallon
&gt;(that's about 40 cents per litre).  This is an increase of over 20%
&gt;in the last month.  
&gt;
&gt;HAve other parts of the USA had such a large increase?

Well, they have here in my part of Canada.  The reason given is that a cold 
winter lead to a run on furnace oil and consequently oil stocks are 
diminished, hence more valuable.  I say we're getting screwed, they took 
their extra profit in the winter, and want more now.  I hope the idea of a 
market driven price kicks in soon, my van is about dry.   Tim Smith
