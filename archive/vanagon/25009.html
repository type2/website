Subject: 83 Diesel price advice

Hi all,

 Today I went to see an 83 Diesel Vanagon that presents the following con-
ditions:

1. Original paint in fair condition
2. Solid body with no rust 
3. Complete bumpershe bumpers
4. Good seats
5. Original radio
6. Rebuilt engine
7. Original manual and maintenance records
8. Signal lights work in perfect conditions

 The owner is asking $2,700 for the van. Is that a good price? It is worth
to wait for another one that runs in gasoline? Please feel free to advice me.

Deeply grateful,
Angel
