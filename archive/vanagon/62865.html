Subject: Announcing vanagon_dot_com chat!

Howdy,

vanagon_dot_com is *finally* proud to announce the installation of it's social
software (courtesy of LikeMinds.)  This most excellent Java chat
environment (written by yours truly) features avatars, multiple
user-created chat spaces, distinct areas (welcome, camping, technical), and
even multiuser sketching!

You'll need a modern java-enabled browser to play... either Microsoft
Internet Explorer 3.02 or Netscape Communicator 4.0.

We'll be having the Shake-Out Chat this evening at 6pm Pacific Time.  Stop
by and say hello!

Coyote
