Subject: Re: EV Piston Slap Questions

  my 93gl had the pistons replaced this past spring at 30.000 miles. it still
makes the clattering noise everyone is talking about. it also seems to run
rough, that is, like the timing is a little off. the noise i noticed before
and after the pistons were replaced sound like the injectors clicking. anyone
else have this?
