Subject: Re: Dealer offers 10K for 91 Carat with 11.8K book value....is it a rip....
Date: Fri, 28 Oct 94 6:34:25 PDT

&gt; 
&gt; A ford Dealer offered me 10K for my 91 Vanagon Carat that has a wholesale
&gt; blue book value of 11.8K...Are they trying to rip me off?? They say that there
&gt; is not a market for VW Vanagons...and didnot believe that the blue book value
&gt; is realistic....(my van is in good shape).....Does anybody have any advice??
&gt; 

	I agree with the 'sell privately' advice. 

	A reseller must make a profit on a used unit, so it makes sense they're
	gonna pay 65 &gt; 75% of low BB. I don't see it as sleazy. It's just
	biz.

	The only rationale for trading-in is ease of disposal. I recently
	bought a pickup from a Ford dealer. The sales guy was straight forward
	and advised me to sell my '93 Escort direct.

	I agree with someone else's comments about the validaty (sp) of BB data.
	I base my sell price on local ads and local new car prices.

	Example: The NADA yellow book lists my 93 Escort LX 2Dr at $8700 (Avg.
	retail). The identical '95 model with air bag is ad'd locally at $8400.
	I couldn't dump the '93 for more than $7K.
