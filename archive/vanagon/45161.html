Movement's afoot to plan the next CCC's trip.  A suggestion has been
made for the last weekend in July, July 26-28th.

Takers?

Location?

I think after this last trip, we'd all be mighty pleased to go somewhere
not hot, and without bugs.  :)  All suggestions welcome.

How about July 19th -21st in North Adams, Mass. Transporters By The Tunnel!
Great camping fun.   Right on the lake, not many bugs and by them summer
might arrive so the Tempo might hit 85.=)  Seriously,  its a good time.
Food for thought.  Take care.
