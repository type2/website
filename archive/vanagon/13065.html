Subject: Auxiliary Heater?

OK, I'm new to my van, and have been reading the owners manual.  There's this
little round knob down by my right knee, next to the heater controls with the
word Temp on it, and some arrows.  I've found it in the manual, under the
heading VW Auxiliary Heater, but for the life of me, I can understand what
this thing is supposed to do.  I turned it on following the directions, but
don't know if it did anything.  Please, someone tell me what this knob really
does!  

Also, I'm told there is a Vanagon Owners Club in Seattle.  Does anyone know
of it? 

Thanks.  I know I'm taking more than I'm giving right now, but hope to be
there for someone someday.
