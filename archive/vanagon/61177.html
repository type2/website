Subject: Speedo Gremlins

I was driving at lunch and noticed that the speedometer had stopped working.
Speed was stuck at 0 - though I did not think to look to notice if the
odometer was working. Hmm, time to put a new cable on the list, I thought. I
parked the Vanagon, and when I was driving home to work, surprize! The speedo
was working!

Do I have speedometer gremlins? Or am I just going crazy and imagining that
the speedo was not working.
