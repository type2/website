&gt;so the braided steel constricts the rubber hose, and directs more pressure to
&gt;the brakes. maybe you NEED this extra braking if you have a porsche 6-cyl
&gt;engine in the back! :)  but other than that, it would likely be just a 'toy'
&gt;to brag about.  it supposedly makes a lot of difference on a 914, though.

I think another claimed benefit is that they are much more
damage-resistant. Just the thing for protecting against rubber-eating
porcupines (after they eat your tires) or driving through fields of
saplings...    No true off-roading van driver should be without them...
