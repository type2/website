&gt; &gt;1. Where would I access the FAQ that would tell me what year this bus 
is?
&gt;
&gt; i've sent a file about the 68-79 buses. my guess, from the white top, 
would
&gt; be that it is a 1971-1976 bus
Had the chance to give the bus a once over. It appears to be a '76, VIN 
2262032307, with 95673 on the odometer, last sticker on the license plate 
was '91. Body had no rust but the paint is faded, interior looks good and 
complete. Engine is missing, said to be a new one in a shed somewhere.....
&gt;
&gt; &gt;2. Does the FAQ contain info about relative value of busses? (For 
example,
&gt;
&gt; on the older buses, this is really hard to figure. no &quot;books&quot; are 
available
&gt; from the banks and credit unions (cause they'd rather NOT lend you any 
money
&gt; on a 20-year old car!).
      Any guesses on the value based on the above description?
&lt;Snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;4. Any tips for approaching the owner about selling his bus and 
negotiating
&gt;
&gt; well ... do NOT look like you are REALLY interested. and find a lot of 
things
&gt; &quot;wrong&quot; with it. it helps if you take someone else with you to do the 
&quot;bad
&gt; mouthing&quot; ... or at least, the nit-picking. ;) that way, the owner may 
figure
&gt; that you are gonna get influenced by your friend and NOT buy the bus.
&gt; sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. depends on how badly the 
owner
&gt; wants to sell. but it does help you in either case: the extra pair of 
eyes
&gt; on your friend can spot things that you might miss.
&gt;
&gt; good luck.

Thanks for all the tips. I have a friend who owns and drives a very ugly 
brown bus who is reasonably knowlegeable. More importantly, he can be a 
very shrewd and cynical shopper who has a lot more chutzpah than I do.
