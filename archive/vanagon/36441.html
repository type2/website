&gt;Am I using selective memory when I seem to recall that the fix for this was
&gt;nothing more  than cleaning the connections at the starter? Does that sound

Yup.  Remove the gunk and take a wire brush to the contacts and the wire
leads.  Also, tap on the starter housing.  Sometimes they get power and just
stick.  Also, check the solenoid wire.  Make sure you have good, clean
contacts there.
