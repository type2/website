Subject: Re: '66 valve adjusting

Adjusting the valves on a '66 engine (in my '62 bus). The official rap
from VW was to adjust them to 0.004&quot; but Muir says 0.006&quot; is better. 
Do you people go with Muir on this one? What difference does it make?
(scuse my ignorance)
-----

go with Muir on this - .006
