&gt;Subject: Re: The Forever Car (or Bus)

&gt;Anybody ever read the book &quot;Why Trade It In?&quot;  Early
&gt;editions had a couple chapters on how much waste goes on in
&gt;cars since the average life was 12 years from showroom to
&gt;junkyard.  Later ones took it out.

Dean,

I have that book but it is packed away in a box in the barn.
The authors did not have to convice me, I liked their
approach.  It did not sound quite as much like the Bob
Revolution as it just made sense for people *not* into
conspicuous consumption.  You got me curious and now I get
to find the right box to see which edition I bought.
