&gt;I want to share with the list my correspondence with VWOA 
&gt;about the deficient heating/defrosting systems in my new 
&gt;Eurovan Winnebago camper.
&gt;
&gt;You can judge for yourself the quality of the response.
&gt;
&gt;My letter to VW ...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dear Sir/Madam:
&gt;
&gt;re: Defrosting/Heating System Eurovan Winnebago VIN 
&gt;WV2ZB0252JH048419
&gt;
&gt;We are writing to express our dissatisfaction with the 
&gt;defrosting and heating systems in our new Eurovan Camper.  
&gt;The systems are so deficient in the Canadian climate that we 
&gt;believe that they constitute a safety hazard.  The vehicle 
&gt;has been evaluated by OWASCO, and the Service Department 
&gt;there has confirmed that the defrosting and heating meet the 
&gt;factory specification.  Accordingly, we are writing to you.
&gt;
&gt;In our experience, despite careful attention to the 
&gt;directions in the Owner's Manual (pp. 78 - 93), it is 
&gt;impossible to demist the windows when the ambient 
&gt;temperature is -10ºC or less.  In more severe weather such 
&gt;as -20ºC, the inside surfaces of the side windows are 
&gt;actually covered in a layer of ice. When outside 
&gt;temperatures are -20ºC temperatures at foot level, even in 
&gt;the front, are as low as 0ºC.  Any passengers in the rear 
&gt;seat are typically wearing a sleeping bag – this in a 1995 
&gt;vehicle!
&gt;The driver is armed with a windshield scraper.
&gt;
&gt;We note that, unlike the non-camper Eurovan, there is no 
&gt;rear auxiliary heat exchanger or fan,  nor is there a floor 
&gt;mounted air outlet.  (We anticipate that the air 
&gt;conditioning in the camper will be as deficient as the 
&gt;heating.)  Furthermore, the outlets shown at the base of the 
&gt;windshield in the graphic on Page 84 of the owner's manual 
&gt;are missing.  
&gt;
&gt;Our primary concern is safety.  Being unable to clear 
&gt;windows is very dangerous.  Our second concern is comfort.  
&gt;No one should have to huddle for warmth in a vehicle costing 
&gt;in excess of $40,000.
&gt;
&gt;We believe that Volkswagen's cold weather testing of this 
&gt;vehicle was seriously flawed.  A van of this size clearly 
&gt;requires an auxiliary heat exchanger.  We would like your 
&gt;response to our comments as soon as possible.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yours sincerely, 
&gt;
&gt;Dan Herbert
&gt;
&gt;P.S.  Our two previous vehicles were VW Westfalias.  The 
&gt;1988 Wasserboxer had a terrific heating system (and leaky 
&gt;head gaskets).

&gt;
&gt;Dear Mr. Herbert
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your correspondence dated January 14, 1996 
&gt;regarding your concerns about the design and serviceability 
&gt;of your vehicle.  We apologize for the inconvenience that 
&gt;this matter has caused.
&gt;
&gt;We appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts 
&gt;with us, as letters such as yours keep us in touch with the 
&gt;customer's point of view.  It is only through information 
&gt;received directly from Volkswagen owners that we can 
&gt;determine where improvements, extensions, or changes might 
&gt;be required.
&gt;
&gt;We share your concerns regarding the difficulties you have 
&gt;experienced with your defrosting and heating systems in your 
&gt;Eurovan Camper.  Repairs are never welcome.  While we cannot 
&gt;guarantee every  vehicle will be defect free, it is our 
&gt;belief that, should a defect occur, it will make itself 
&gt;evident well within the terms of our limited new vehicle 
&gt;warranty.
&gt;
&gt;We want to assure you that by taking the time to write, your 
&gt;concerns about the design of the defrosting and heating 
&gt;systems will be noted by the appropriate departments within 
&gt;our company.  We have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy 
&gt;of your correspondence to our Product Planning Department.
&gt;
&gt;Please be advised that one of our highest priorities is 
&gt;customer satisfaction, and we make every effort to provide 
&gt;reliable products and service to our customers.  Thank you 
&gt;for taking the time to write, and for allowing us the 
&gt;opportunity to respond to your concerns.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;Anne M. Talan
&gt;Customer Relations Representative

&gt;Do any V_at_L readers have any comment?

My guess is that VW really doesn't care about it's customers. At least not
the ones that by vans. One would think that VW or Winnebago would be willing
to resolve the problem, even if it meant modifying the vehicle with an
auxillary heater.  I would consider going to a custom van shop and having one
installed.  I Would like to someday get a Rialta.  I wonder if this unit is
any better.  At least it has a propane furnace!  I guess VW feels that por
heat is as suffecient as the poor acceleration. Maybe someone should take a
Ford full size Van and equip it as a Vanagin Westfalia.  I think it would
sell like hot cakes.  I want mine with four wheel drive.  
Dennis.

PS-  All of us should write to VW to inform them that we know of this
situation and what our chances are of buying a vehicle from a company that is
so insensitive.
