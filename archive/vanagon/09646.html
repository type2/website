&gt;....does anyone have any experience with the fan that fits
&gt;in the tube from the back to the front which is supposed to
&gt;help get heat in to the poor little bus (pre-80)? I know you

I picked up an inline fan from boating store at a marina. I think it's
original purpose is to pump fumes out of gas tanks before you start your
boats engine. Diameter is 4&quot; and it draws 3.8 amps. They hooked it up to a
battery and I was impressed with the performance. It's also relatively
quiet. Also, it only cost $19.75! JC Whitney's is $70 and I heard it's not
too good. (The idea of getting the fan from a boating store came from
someone on this list, but I can't remember who.)

I have not yet had a chance to install it on my 75 bus, but will do so as
soon as it get's a bit warmer (wish I had a garage!).
