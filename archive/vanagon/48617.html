Subject: Bike racks/trailer hitches

After twisting up my front bumper with an el cheapo bike rack I would like to
switch to a rack that would slip into a 2&quot;receiver trailer hitch. I already
have the rack from another vehicle, but I can't find a hitch to fit a
Vanagon. I spoke to a guy at U-haul who said that all they had were the
regular ball type hitches and he didn't think anyone made a receiver type
hitch. So I am throwing it out to you, has anyone seen one of things?
