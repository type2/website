Subject: CCC mailing list problem

Howdy,

A disk crash caused the loss of the CCC mailing list registry over the
weekend.  Unfortunately, the only backup tape is bad.  (The sysadmin has
been told to keep old backup tapes in the future.)

If you wish to be a member of the CCC mailing list, you need to
resubscribe.  To subscribe to the list send email to
ccc-request_at_vanagon_dot_com with the following body:

Sorry for the inconvenience!
