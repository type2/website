&gt; OK you early busses. Take heart. 
&gt; 
&gt; Sunday's New York Times picked 14 cars most likely to increase in value in
&gt; the next few years and you guys made the list. Says the Times, &quot;1956-76
&gt; Volkswagen Microbus. Current value: $1,000 to $8,000. Five-year projection:
&gt; up to $25,000.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 

While it is good that the projected value of these buses does go up (not really
unexpected) an owner or prospective buyer should be aware that the value will
decrease depending on the condition as well as the year.  The later the year
the lesser the value.  In other words, I find it hard to believe that in five
years that a '76 bus will be valued at $25,000 even in pristine condition.
You also have to find someone willing to pay you that much for your baby.

The real value should be derived from caring for and driving your Type II.
