Subject: WESTY FABRIC, TO CLARIFY

To clarify for all who have replied to me, I know of 3 schemes
containing green in '75?? - '79 Westys.  The first which the Trim
Shop (now the Thing Shop for those who asked, used to be a VW
interior only place in Phoenix, now does only Thing parts but still
has about 50 rolls of OEM fabric in my estimation) has is as follows.

Primarily BRIGHT YELLOW, and BRIGHT GREEN, on a 2&quot; x 2&quot; plaid, 
intermixed with 0.5&quot; black and 0.5&quot; orange, if you got this scheme
you will know it.  I have seen this in Orange, but primarily in
bright Yellow standard '77-'78 Westys.  The sides are green vinyl.
(BTW I might just be wrong the green and orange might be switched
as the '77 is not here I can't check for sure)

Now lime green and brown Westys like my '78 brown with brown dash
seem usually to have 2&quot; x 2&quot; beige and brown with 0.5&quot; black and
green stripes intermixed.  Brown usually have brown vinyl sided, green 
have green vinyl sides.

Some orange buses have and primarily green and orange, with NO YELLOW.

Others I have seen have a beige, blue, brown, black.

NOW THE STUFF I CAN GET IS ONLY IF YOUR PRIMARY COLORS is YELLOW, then
GREEN, AND ORANGE.  Even if incorrect it would look great in an orange
bus that did not origionally have the yellow.

This said, I will order the 30 yd roll tomorrow.  I will extend first 
come first serve to those who already have contacted me, then to others.
If much interest I will try to get both rolls.

I calculate now roughly for a '78

rear cushion over engine (both sides), 7 ft
rear seat cushions, 5 ft
front seat cusions (both sides), 4 ft
top cushions, 8 ft

so 24 ft or for margin say 10 yds per bus should do it, and will
cost you $100 plus shipping.
