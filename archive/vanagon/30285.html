&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 	I just have a kooky question which came to me the other day while 
&gt; going to sleep in my bus.  Which way does everyone sleep?  Personally, I 
&gt; sleep with my head to the rear but I have to be careful not to hit my 
&gt; head on the shelf.  That's when I wondered if anyone else slept the other 
&gt; way and why.  This is assuming you'd be sleeping in the lower level 
&gt; (downstairs) of course.  Actually, now I'm curious about the upper level 
&gt; as well.  Well???

Downstairs I sleep with my head to the rear so my pillow doesn't fall off 
the end of the pad in the middle of the night.  Upstairs it's reversed so 
I don't get:
a) claustrophobic
b) my head stuck in the roof wedge
c) killed if the roof collapses suddenly in a strong wind.

YMMV of course.

Jack
