&gt;You people are lucky.  I only get about 200 miles/tank.  I get about
&gt;18 MPG, and 10.5 gallon tank.  I was thinking if just getting a rack for
&gt;2 jerry cans on the back.  And that would also give me a cool adventurer
&gt;look. :)

i've seen pictures of a bus with an extended 'platform'-looking bumper on
the back. it had a small moped-type bicycle creature tied down and two
jerry cans. i'd worry a little bit about the heat and the idiot behind me.
don't know if it would be safer to mount any such cans on the front. on the
roof would be a back-wrenching ordeal to get down.

i had thought about all that room up under the bus, you know, where the
gas heater and stuff can go, or the propane tank for the camper. anyway,
i plotted and planned about some self-made or professional-crafted fuel cells
to fit up in there ... but the designs turned out to be so long and skinny
that i figured it wouldn't be able to suck the gas out too well. and no way
to fill it (except gravity from the main tank).

i wrote to Oettinger about getting the plans for that 100-liter tank for the
vanagons (thinking to make the modifications to an existing one from a junk
yard), but they wouldn't go for it ... the letter implied that they were
afraid of american lawyers. :(

do you suppose bradley could fit a 16 gallon  tank from a 68-&gt; bus in his
split?  that would give you about 275 miles or so.
