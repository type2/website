Subject: Interesting Bus conversions

I have often thought of combining two busses (the front and rear 2/3 of
each) to make a stretch bus.  There is some talk here lately of one of these
having been sighted in Palo Alto, or something.  It seems that it would be
rather straightforward sheet metal work.  Has anyone else done this?

I did see in Los Alamos a '63+'64 stretched by one window panel, and a tall
roof out the top.  This guy is a hermit electrical engineer for the Lab
there, and has the whole thing instrumented to the hilt, with propane
heater, stove, tanks, and even a shower inside.  Pretty neat.  

Another dream I have is to plant a bug top on the roof of my Westfalia, so
that you'd have the windsheild like those old Greyhound busses, and more
glass all around.  I just can't give up the upper bunk, though.
