So William Abbott says:
&gt; 
&gt; 	Folks,
&gt; 	I've found a single-cab with a blown engine, 1970 model,
&gt; new side gates in addition to the rusty ones on it, for $1200, old
&gt; engine pieces included.
&gt;
 ----- erotic description of high points of single-cab deleted ---
&gt; 
&gt; 	I'm MIGHTILY tempted by this single-cab.
&gt; 

Bill, 

Unless you've been fantasizing about another VW, I'd say this is
the one for you.  At that price, I don't think you can lose.
Even with some rust.
