Subject: Bars Leaks? Opinion?

Before I spend the weekend redoing what the VW dealer screwed up, oil leak
(pushrod tubes) on left side and water on right (the gasket) do I remember a
notice NOT to add antileak stuff to the coolant (plugs radiator)? I have seen
many postings about Bars Leaks but no definitive statement not to use?

84 Westy (Wally) 120+K and holding... and leaking
