Subject: 86 Westy Electrical Questions/Problems

While driving thru the brunt of hurricane Eddie, we lost our front and rear
windshield wipers, heater blower motor,aux. heater, rear defroster, and last
but not least the A.C.. We checked all the fuses and relays we could find
and they all seemed to be AOK. There didn't seemed to be any water or
moisture anywhere near the fuse panel , which is always a concern . After
consulting with Bentley, we realized that our relay panel seems to be
missing some of the relays shown in the book. Though at this time thats a
B-list problem {everything was working before we noticed the difference.}
  So here are a couple of questions I hope you guys can help me out with,
    1. Are there any other fuses or relays I need to be searching for?
    2. What does the load reduction relay do ?
    3. Bentley shows a 2nd. stage rad. cooling fan relay , I can't find it
on the panel, what is the purpose of it and where else may it be located ?
  

                Thanks alot in advance.
