Hi The Tristar has black plastic fender flares and is painted flat black
on the bottom (from the lower body crease or groove that goes down the
side that is 8&quot; up from the bottom)(burgandy top)instead of the bolt on
rocker mouldings. Looks good. I need to get some pictures taken so I can
send them on the web.
