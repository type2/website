Subject: Advice sought for Family trip to Orlando, Florida



Although this is only marginally VW related, I thought I'd give it a
try, sorry for wasting the bandwidth...
						
The Seren Family is going to Orlando, Florida!!! (I am disgusted with
the prospect of spending Thansgiving week with Mickey and his friends
and the whole commercial establishment, but agreed to do it one last
time for the kids -- they didn't even want to drive the Vanagon down
so we're flying).

Here are a few questions for those listmembers Around Orlando, Fl:

- Any Place around Orlando that we can rent an aircooled? We've made
  arrangements with Hertz already, but a VW rental would certainly
  make it easier to put up with Mickey a whole week.  It does not have
  to be a westy, come to think of it, does not have to be a bus, could
  even be a beetle or a beetle convertible...  If no such luck, then
  are there any establishments that rent vanagons?  I'd appreciate any
  pointers to such places...  

- Tickets:  My wife already found some semi-decent deals for Disney,
  Epcot, MGM, Universal, etc.., but are there any good ways to get
  them cheap that usually is not known to people up North?

- NASA space center:  are they open to tours Thurs. and Fri. of
  Thanksgiving week? Should we be making advance reservations?

- Anything around Orlando, Florida that I can use to escape?  Any
  Hike/Bike trails, swimming/diving opportunities (I understand
  either coast is about 60 Miles)?

- Any general pointers and ideas appreciated....

Thanks,
Cetin
