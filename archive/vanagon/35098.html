&gt;	I now call on the expertise of those who have breadloaf buses
&gt;	with air conditioning.  On my '78, the compressor is not
&gt;	currently hooked up, i.e. no belt.  However, by looking at the
&gt;	thing I can't tell for sh*t how to hook the darn thing up.
&gt;	There is nothing in the owner's manual about it.  I can see the
&gt;	pully on the compressor but I can't see how to get it over to
&gt;	the crankshaft pulley.  Can someone please tell me how to hook
&gt;	it up?  This one's got me stumped.  Thanks.  Also, where can I
&gt;	get a proper belt for this?  Is it the same one for the
&gt;	alternator or is it different?
&gt;
&gt;	Things I did today:

Lets have some fun.  The pulley for the AC is located behind the fan.  The
fan has to be removed and the belt is feed behind the fan housing.  The
tension is usually adjusted with shims at the bottom of the compressor
bracket.  There should also be an idler pulley midway under the bottom of the
belt that stops the belt from whipping and vibrating.  By a very good belt
ofr this as the heat in this area will destroy standard off the shelf stuff.
 I suggest getting it from the dealer.  The correct one is made pf special
material and is expensive.  Be carefull how you use the AC as it is the kiss
of death for the air cooled engine.
