Subject: It lives! (continued...)

Rides GREAT. Drives GREAT. Doesn't spew any oil (yet.)
Two problems for the type4 gurus:
Difficult to find/shift into 1st.
Difficult to find/shift into 2nd.
3rd and 4th are OK, so far as I can tell.
Doesn't pop out of any gear.
Am I going to be looking for new trannys in the future?

Who wished he would have paid more attention to the type4 stuff...:)
