&gt; Hi Frank and congrats....   looks like the best deal possible. VW prices 
&gt; have improved since I checked 3 years ago ($440 for a muffler) Send me RMR 
&gt; phone number please!. Won't CTC warranty the muffler for life if they 
&gt; install it?, might pay since I burnt one out in 2 years. I used stainless 
&gt; steel Allen head screws to replace all the exhaust studs, &lt;$5.00 and they 
&gt; are easier to get at in tight places. Whatever. Maybe I should fix mine 
&gt; properly?   tjs
&gt; 
&gt; 

Tim here's R.M.R stuff:   2945 Diab St., Ville St.Laurent

Your right about the Canadian Tire guarentee.  It's one year over the
counter or &quot;LIFE&quot; if they install it !  I was thinking of putting all the
new pieces in with the old muffler then going down there and have them
install the new muffler.  I tried to get stainless bolts yesterday at
Ottawa Fastner, no luck, so I had to settle for the ordinary stuff.  Where
did you find the stainless bolts you used ?  

Cheers,

Frank
