Subject: EV - Cracked heater hoses

While researching on the list archive I notices a few posts concerning 
cracked rear Ev heater hoses (pipes?).  Well add me to the list of 
victims (happened last fall).  

My fix took 2 hours and cost $4.50. I went to My favorite FLAPS and 
bought some OEM replacement coolant hose ( the preformed kind ) of the 
right diameter and rigged the system back to working condition. after a 
tough winter and some hot days this year no problems.
