I've spents some dollars on guages all VDO and my opinion is that they are
all show and no go.  I'm thouroughly underwhelmed by their precision (no
accuracy ).

I have used a GB dipstick deal (under $10 ) for two years now and recomend
it.  Think about it, you don't need to know the temp just if the engine is
too hot.

I did see one guy in San Jo' at an event that had made some impressive guages
for his bus but the he was and EE.
