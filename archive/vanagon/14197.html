Subject: RED ROCK What is it?

I've just subscribed to the mailing list and have read a lot about 
Red rock. Can anybody tell me what this is - I'm particularly 
interested in the various mentions of 'Buses rock jumping in the 
canyon !!??!' - What's all this about?. I would be very grateful if 
anybody could enlighten me.

                ..... Cheers
                            Jon
                            
                           
     ps. Try raw rhubarb stalks dipped in sugar - rotten for your 
teeth - but delicious.

    pps. DON'T EAT THE LEAVES !!!!
