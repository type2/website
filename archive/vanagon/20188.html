No, damn it, I had tix for the next evenings shoe. You know, the one that 
was cancelled. It was my understanding there were too many folks in 
attendence that didn't have tickets. Deer Creek is the smallest arena on 
there tour. Thus it's the hardest to get tickets for. When everyone 
travels from show to the next, some won't be able to get 'em. The Deer 
Creek security folks weren't getting people in fast enough to suit the 
masses, so they stormed the place and climbed the fence. Finally the 
fence caved in. It made the news all around here. When we arrived at Deer 
Creek yesterday, we were told to return home, the show had been 
cancelled. Bummer! We did go to one of the bigger camps and toured the 
vendors. Bought a couple of great shirts and had some very good eats, 
veggie burritos and egg rolls. I highly reccommend them!
