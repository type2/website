&gt;From What I have heard the final drive of the 4spd and the 5spd are
almost identical... the difference being with the 5spd in a diesel
you're keeping the engine in a narrower torque band...
	Didn't know they made a 5spd for a gas wasserboxer...never heard of one
here in the States...

	I would think it really is not worth the effort...

	My $.02 worth...
