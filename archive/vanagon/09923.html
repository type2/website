&gt; Does anyone know about the chances of said electric pump fitting my 
&gt; '71?  It doesn't work at all now.  Somewhere I have the name of a 
&gt; place that sells rebuild kits for these.  If a '74 or newer pump would
&gt; fit I could salvage one and then rebuild it.  Yes?  No?  Indifferent?

  J.C. Whitney sells an elecric pump and faucet kit which I recently bought
  when it was on sale for $19.95. The electric pump does not fit the '74
  so I used only the new faucet and switch. I think that the stuff would
  work on the '71 - The pump fittings want a hose from the water supply and 
  and a hose to the faucet &lt;the pump on the '74 mounts directly to the tank&gt;.
  If you want to buy only the faucet and switch from J.C. Whitney, you can 
  have my pump that doesn't fit - just tell me where to send it.

  If you would rather stick with the hand pump, I got one for my '72 from
  a RV parts place. It was a Coleman, it looked different than the original
  but it fit and worked fine.
