Subject: '78-79 Westy colors (was: '76 or '77, possible purchase...)


&gt;I must disagree with this. I have seen at least 2 '78 Westfalias that had light
&gt;beige paint, and an interior plaid of fine green and brown '70's glory.
&gt;Just another useless fact, I know...

'78 Westys were available in Dakota Beige and '79's were available 
in Mexico Beige I believe.  Both interiors were brown/yellow/green 
plaid.
