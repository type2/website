&gt; The whole event was filmed by a video geek student of mine, and there's

&gt; Bravo Bill and thanks again! - It was a real &quot;VW-type&quot; weekend....

Yeah... 'Sex, Drugs, and Rock n Roll', or at least Beer, Drugs, and Rock 
n Roll.  Well, OK... Just Beer and Rock n Roll.  :)

And the breakfast with Martha and Don Kane was fun too.  I'm sorry Dave 
and kids didn't show.  But at least Don's daughter enjoyed her breakfast 
of whipped cream, sausages, bacon and milkshake (well she didn't reall 
like the bacon).
