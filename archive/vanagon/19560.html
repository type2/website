Subject: replacement seats?

My wife is about 5'2&quot; and tends to slide out of the passenger seat in my '76
Campmobile -- I'd ridden in a FOAF's car which had &quot;Recaro&quot; type semi-racing
seats -- how hard would it be to replace at least the passenger seat with one
of those &quot;edged&quot; type seats you kind of snap into? Can I use the stock rails?
Thanks!
