&gt;I waved at a Eurovan MV yesterday, and he honked and waved back!  &lt;grin&gt;

You'd think in MEXICO where there are few enough YANKEES to begin with, that
fellow VANAGON OWNERS would WAVE BACK.....

But NOOOOOOOOOOO......

It finally got to be such a joke, we'd make all kind of faces and gestures

My travel companion even started to think I was weird.

Guess he was right.
