Kenneth:
Make certain that is what you need. If you think you have an internal
head seal leak have it confirmed. My friendly neighborhood mechanic used
hie exhaust analyzer to sniff my overflow tank for hydrocarbons. This
would be the confirmation. As it turned out my radiator needed to be
professionally cleaned. I removed it and took it to a shop that &quot;blasted&quot;
it out .
Good Luck &amp; Drive Safely
