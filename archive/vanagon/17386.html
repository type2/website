&gt; Hello,
&gt;Can anyone offer a suggestion as to what my next step should be to eliminate a 
&gt; flat spot just as I accelerate my '69 single cab?

What kind of distributor do you have?  I don't know if they had vacuum
advance in that year.  I do know that typically mechanical advance
distributors are bad for part throttle driveability.  This has been
discussed a lot on the Fordnatics list.  I also experienced a flat spot
when I went from my dual-vacuum advance to a Bosch 009 (all mechanical).
I went back to the stock dual-vacuum advance.  I would also check my
electrical system, especially points and spark plug wires.  An arcing
plug wire or corroded points could cause these symptons too.  As always,
YMMV.
