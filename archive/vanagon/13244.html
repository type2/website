Subject: Syncro Westie With the Front CV (Black and) Blues

I'd like to get some input on the front CVs, i.e. How long have your front CVs 
lasted?  How much did it cost in US$ for each CV?  How much was the overall 
repair is US$?  Is changing front CVs on a Syncro as rudimentary as the early 
'70s type I (rear) CVs?  Any other thoughts or comments?  We currently have 
just over 56K miles on our '90 Syncro Westie and the CVs went south last 
weekend....  They're driving me nuts with the constant clunk, clunk, clunk 
sound, but I'd like to get some feedback from those of you with Syncros before 
I go to get it repaired at the dealer.  Thanks in advance for you advice...

       Jon
