&gt;The effect I experience with my '91 Westy definitely &lt;&lt;feels&gt;&gt; like air

&gt;reduces the under vehicle air flow.  My 82 camper, which didn't have the
&gt;front air dam, behaved much better.

hmmmm. my 88 behaves ok (to me), but i wonder now ... i removed the air
dam under the 'chin' ... it kept scraping on curbs and uphll parking lot
entrances, so my 88 has the same profile as my old 80 bus (except for being
a couple of inches lower). and it handles pretty much the same.

p.s. anybody want an air dam? :)
