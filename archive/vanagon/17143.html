 I think it was all change sometime in '71. I don't know exactly when
 but it probably when the disc brakes/rectancular rear lights/ etc
 arrived but I can't be sure. The early style box has a round `shank'
 that sticks thru the chassis and hence a round hole. The later type has 
 a larger squarer shank and a so a larger squarish hole. (Fun this; so
 educational. The round thing goes in the round hole and ... :))
 
 So maybe this is why you could get the box off without removing the arm. 
 I certainly can't on mine although I wish I could. 
 Anyhow the later style box is miles better IMHO and should be used if
 at all possible.
