Yup.  Pull handles, knee-action engine lid, small-nut tranny ...
 
&gt; i was thanking jim for the 1500 us standard as of 64 model year confirmation.

Which is probably why there is no &quot;1500&quot; designation on the backside.

&gt; 0578878 motor number was about end of May production 1964.  sorry for
&gt; not looking more carefully at the numbers. 

Hey, no problem.  With this info I can begin to make sense of it all ...

Thanks for your help!
