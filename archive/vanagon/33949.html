Subject: Brake job (1962) - STILL!!!

&gt; Subject: Brake job (1962) - STILL!!!

&gt; Taking the rear brakes apart was no problem, but the springs
&gt; are bigger &amp; different in the front. Muir says glibly &quot;just
&gt; pry the bottom of the shoe out of the slot and twist to
&gt; remove the springs&quot; (or something). Impossible. Will
&gt; draining the brake system help? I tried taking the cylinders
&gt; off, undid the only bolts I could see (getting desperate!)
&gt; but that just made the backplate loose.  Anymore of those
&gt; good ideas on how to do this bit?

When St. Muir says just pry, he speaks the truth.  The point
of the prying is to slip the end of the brake shoe with the
tongue on it out of the adjusting screw which has the
adjusting (star) nut on it and is slipped into the end of
the cylinder.  Prying the whole shoe out (springs and all)
will allow you to pull both shoes off (with springs still
attached).  It may be (if the shoe is rusted to the
adjusting screw) that the whole adjusting setup (screw and
nut) pull out of the cylinder.

Both shoes have a long end which slips into the
corresponding adjuster.  Either can be pried out first.
Getting one out usually makes the other just slide out
(unless severely rusted in place).  Draining would not hurt
anything, but probably would not be much of a help (unless
the cylinders are *frozen* in the *out* position).  Taking
the bolts out will not hurt, but the only way that might
help is if you take the connecting brake line between the
two off so the whole assembly comes off with the bolts.

To take the whole thing off, the brake line must off course
be removed as well (hence drained).  If the backing plate is
already loose, there cannot be much holding any of the
brakes on!  Keep in mind that even if you can take the whole
assembly off, you still have to get the shoes pried apart
enough to get them out of the slot in the adjusting screws.

&gt; Also, any criteria on when a wheel cylinder needs replacing,
&gt; or when an overhaul will do?

By the time you have gotten this far, replacing the
cylinders would seem a *must* in my book.  Some people will
rebuild with a kit and some people will always replace the
cylinder.  I see that prices for 1962 front cylinders are
$36.75 (x 4) at Bus Stop, so I can understand a reluctance
to avoid $150 in costs.  Glad those for my 67s are only
$12.75 each!

&gt; Just let me know when you get bored of all my questions!

You ask and learn.  Some answer and learn.  Some just
lurk and learn.  I thought that was why we are here.

Good luck, keep warm...
