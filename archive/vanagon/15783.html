Subject: FREE '71 Westy--No ENG/TRANS

    I talked to Joe over the phone and this has been sitting in his back
    yard for 2 years and he is going to call the scrap metal people if no
    one wants it.  He says most of the interior is still there, in poor
    shape...

    Good for parts, or a full restore...  Hey, isn't the 71 the last year of
    the upright motor, first year of disc brakes?

    Anyone know if the camper stuff will fit my '75?

    Call Joe...
