Subject: motie engineers

 On the other hand, none of the work specified is
&gt;unique on the Vanagon, so any competent garage could do it.  On the gripping
&gt;hand, rear brakes are a reasonable driveway project;

Interesting, someone else who's read Niven, wouldn't it be nice to have a
few moties around for the job?
back to known space.
