Scott,

I have had my 85 Westy (1.9l wimpy) for three years now.  I regularly tow my
motorcyle trailer with a full load on long trips, plus people and gear in the
van.  The trailer wieghs about 400 lbs on its own (single axle) and the
motrocyle is 1200 lbs.  I also put on two 100 lb mopeds, a bycicle and
various boxes and coolers.  In the cab of the van, I have myself and my wife,
(300 lbs total) plus other camping gear, clothing, extra tools, etc... (about
another 200 lbs).  I have been traveling with no problems from the weight.  I
also tow my 1000 lb boat with the van and have not had any problems.  I
usually take a 700 mile trip to my in-laws about once a month.

The only thing to remember is to take care of it.  If you ignore it, things
will break.  I could say that about any car, though.
