 AJ, the whistling during warmiup may be due to a leak in your aux air valve
 circuit(84 had them)  as for the engine...My 84 has been meticulously
 maintained since new w/ all oil and coolant changes.I have orig.heads and
 head gaskets at 220k mi. but Im an exception rather than a norm.I have
 travelled w/o regard from San Diego to Calgary A.B. in Dec./ 5 years in a
 row.To Alaska and across the Mohave desert pulling a trailer in Aug for 7
 tears.Ok Im a gambler.........I have had other annoying breakdowns..but no
 water problems...mind you, I custom tuned my engine(believe it or not,
 Canadian truckers were talking up a storm on CB last December when I blew
 them off climbing the trans Canada out of Calgary to Banff with 5 people and
 ski gear travelling 85mph), and installed a custom lower t/stat 160 deg.so
my
 engine has run cool from the gate.I would suggest you try to get the service
 records from the prior owners  and have someone check out the engine
 thoroughly(compression,scope,co% etc.then check the coolant w/ a color dip
 indicator(for exhaust gases) or pressure tester, or have your mechanic check
 the coolant w/ his HC sniffer. If this is ok I would probably chance
 it....but other members may disagree w/ me on this....Hey life's a risk.
  What say you Dennis?
 
 Good Luck

I tend to agree.
