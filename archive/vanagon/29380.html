Subject: Re: Source for Westy Cabinet Edging

I am about to do the edging for the '67 &quot;Westy Resto from Hell.&quot; Probably
soon after the new year. I have a friend who was able to easily obtain the
grey gasket poop for his jealousie windows and white  cabinet/table edging
for his '66 Westy (that was real similar to OEM)  from a local &quot;RV&quot; outfit.
The jealosie window gasket stuff was a perfect match!  I suppose there is at
least a 50% chance that this source, or one similar/located near you, would
have other colors.
I had long &quot;assumed&quot; that both of the items mentioned above were long since
impossible to obtain. I refuse to believe that VWOA/VWAG has a secret edging
factory.  $32 per meter is absurd but believable from the friendly dealers.   8P
Happy Holiday to all you Turkeys out there (Canadians too)
