Subject: 87 armrest collection

Can anyone tell me how to remove/reinstall the armrests in my 
87'.  It appears that the PO allowed three of them to fall off and then 
just stashed them under the jump seat.  It also looks like I might have a 
few stripped allen screws to replace.  I don't know if there is a special 
tool I need to get or what.  Thanks in advance.
