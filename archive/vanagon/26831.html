This posting has no technical value,  I just need to vent.  Last 
night 2 cops came to my house, woke me up at midnight and questioned 
me about 
some chick that ran away from home.  She was not at my house and I 
told them that I barely know her and I wouldn't let her stay any way 
cause she is a minor and I also know she steals everything she gets 
her hands on.  They decided that this wasn't good enough and kept 
questioning me anyway.  Finally, I got the bastards to leave, I shut 
the door and went back to sleep upset but no worse for the ware.  
    Well, at least I thaught they left.  When I went out to my bus 
this morning the pasanger floormat was in the drive way.  My 
interrior is nearly perfect and I am verry meticulous about where 
every thing is in the bus, This is one of those really big grass mats 
and they don't just fall out with out you noticing.  as i went 
through the bus I found the contents of an ashtray on the pasanger 
seat, the insulation under the seat disturbed and some paper that was 
in the rear cabnet magically apeared inthe adjacent closet.  I am so 
pissed about this I am shaking as I type.  I know the bus was 
completely locked last night, and it was still locked this morning.  
Only some one with a slimjim could have got in and that is standard 
equipment in cop cars.  I called the station and got the standard 
runaround, &quot;We don't deal with that, you need to contact  x 
department&quot;  finally, I was able to leave a message on the chiefs 
machine, He WILL be hearing from me again.  What is it about this bus 
that seems to invite ill doing?
