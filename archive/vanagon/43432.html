Subject: Re: Westy Roof Storage Questions

&gt;Anyone have suggestions on what might be a good way to keep clothes and
&gt;equipment dry that one would store on the top storage area just above the
&gt;driver and passenger of a late model Vanagon (1990 in my case).  Does
&gt;anyone make a large waterproof bag that would fit that storage area.

Yeah, they're called dry bags; used for river rafting or sea kayaking and
available at better outdoor supply places. I think Campmore catalog has a
few that are not too expensive.
