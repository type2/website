&gt;I noticed many of you speak of a second battery under the drivers seat., 
&gt; In my 88 westy, there is no second battery... just a space for one and 
&gt;some kind of electrical circuit/junction box.   There is no mention made 
&gt;of a second battery in the owners manual.  Should there be one?  Shoud I 
&gt;install a second??

Second batteries were generally installed in base Camper models which had no
sink or stove but did have a refrigerator.  This refrigerator was
12VDC/120VAC powered with no capacity for propane power like the refer in the
complete GL Camper models.  Since there was no propane power VW included the
second battery to allow you to power the fridge overnight without running
down the primary battery.
