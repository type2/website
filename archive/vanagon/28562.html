Excerpts from vanagon: 9-Nov-95 RE: Volkswagen 'quality' /L by &quot;Maher,
Steve _at_po2.gi.co 
&gt; VW Content: How many people have ripped the fuel injection system out
&gt; of their Type 3's and '75-later Type 1's, and replaced them with carbs?
&gt; A LOT, and for good reason. When they crap out, they can make your life
&gt; miserable, and there's no way you can diagnose those either.
Where do all of the &quot;ripped out&quot; fuel injection systems go?  I spent
about a year diagnosing a fuel injection problem on my squareback.  I
never found out what was wrong because it was actually an ignition
problem.  Someday I will learn to always check the simple things first. 
If anyone knows where to find Type III parts in the Northeast I would
appreciate any leads.  If so many people threw away their fuel
injection, there must be people with boxes of junk in their garages.   

James
