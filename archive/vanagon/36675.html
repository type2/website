Well, I started sandblasting this AM.  What a mess!

This sandblasting unit, the one I got at harbor freight, seems to work 
pretty good.  The nozzle is already shot, but I think thats because I
made the mistake of trying to control the flow with it.  I remember seeing
a labeln on another sandblaster, with the warning &quot;DO NOT THROTTLE!&quot;  (sigh)
It leaks air pretty good thru the nozzle now.  The really good, spring-loaded
nozzle is $110 at the sandblasting store, so I think I'll get that one.  And
not &quot;throttle&quot; it!

Anyway, it takes the rust, undercoating, paint, etc off like a big eraser.
Its leaving some pitting, but I'm only using it on pieces that aren't
easily seen.

I made a mess because I only put plastic down, and not on the sides.  Gotta
protect that cement floor, ya know!  I learned.  So now its off to the 
hardware store to buy some more 6mil visquine.  And a whisk broom.  And a 
dustpan.  And a strainer.

The air compressor is keeping up with the blasting just fine. I can blast
5-10 minutes before it kix in.  I'm blasting at about 60-70 psi, which is
a somewhat less aggressive (I tried it at 100) but I have a lot more control.

I'll post another update this afternoon.
