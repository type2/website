Subject: Hired Engine Swappers?




Assuming one might be interested in something like the engine swaps 
mentioned in Kennedy Engineering's catalog, Suburu, etc., and assuming 
one doesn't want to do such a task personally, what is the best alternative?

For example, I'm in the San Francisco Bay region. Are their specialists 
available who can do this swap for you? And after it's done, who can / 
will maintain it? Any one with experiences in this area who don't 
personally do such heavy mechanical stuff?

TIA,

James
