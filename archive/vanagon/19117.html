Please forgive my stupid and probably ill-informed notions ;)
But..
What about the idea that the oil should hover around 212 F (or 100 C for
us in the SI world) to assure that moisture is driven-off the oil. Is this
one of those myths that upon closer examination falls apart? I mean, 180 F
is probably hot enough to dry the oil, no?

BTW how do you measure those throttle settings (12%, 17% etc)? Is it 
taken at the throttle valve, a potentiometer as in the Digifant I system?
