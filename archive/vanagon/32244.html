Subject: a snowy day


I was out driving an EV full of kids to their homes last night, a half
hour before they announced the vehicle ban on the roads. The road were
plowed earlier, but they had another foot of fresh snow on them, plus
the drifts.

The Continental tires on the EV (which Rick wrote about) were deflated
to around 20psi, and they have 38K miles on them.  The traffic was
non-existent, and roads had some tire tracks on them which I moade use
of. It was kind of fun (I had to keep reminding myself I had a bunch
kids in the van to refrain from having some real fun :-)  I was just
about the only driver without chains or snow tires on the road.  The
EV did exceptionally well and I was very proud of it (If the new tires
Rick got are so much better than the Contis, well, maybe I'll trythose
when it's time to change the Contis)..

The only time I got semi-stuck was in my own cul-de-sac, where the EV
decided the the fresh snow was deep enough to float on...
I was able to back up and ram through it into the garage after a few
tries. 

Happy Shoveling!!!!
