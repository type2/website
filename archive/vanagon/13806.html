Subject: ba. people to redrock..

Ok, because I have such a mail lag now, and want to get
this thing settled, here's what I propose:  people should
take 99, and look for broken down vanagons all along the
way on the whole trip!  :)

I suggest that we sleep overnite for free at the Cal
Trans rest area, which is in Tulare, about 2 hours
from Red Rock, and I'll post the location soon...
