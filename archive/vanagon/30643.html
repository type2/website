My lunchbox hit 92mph downhill, on a flat it won't go even a tick over 
83mph. I love all the torque, though, which lets me go 83 even on a 
slight uphill.
But, I've found optimum mpg at 53 mph: my best was 28mpg (93 octane), 
average about 23mpg. I don't mind goin' slow, where I'm goin' ain't goin' 
nowhere....
