Subject: Re: sheepskin seat covers

I  received  seat covers  Christmas of 1995 from the following business
which has been in existence at least 20 years:
    
    Strausstown Fur Shop
    11 West Main Street
    Strausstown PA 19559
    (215) 488-1415

They were a  gift so I don't know the price.  I live in Washington state
and was able to easily provide all necessary fitting information by phone. 
They fit great although they were sent back for rework once because they
were not tailored for  arm rests.  That problem was corrected free of
charge.  If you order, emphasize the arm rests and they'll  likely be right
the first time.
