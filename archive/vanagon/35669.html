&gt;I can't get the darn valve guides out of my T4 1700cc heads!!  The 
&gt;intake guides are within specs, but the exhaust guides are way out so 
&gt;I am going to remove them and replace. 

I use 3/8 threaded rod and nut/flat washers, Tap, deep socket,. Socket should
just fit over the valve guide boss.  Thread guide with tap approx 3/4 inch.
 screw in threaeded rod, place socket over top, use nut and washer to pull
guide up.  Lubricating nut and washer with never sieze will help.

Installing guides require heating head.  Guides will probably have to be
reamed after installing.
