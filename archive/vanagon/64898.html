Subject:      Engine troubles!

My name is Ralf and I from Germany, living since 1989 in Virginia. I have a
87 Multivan
2.1 Wasserboxer which is giving me lots of headaches these days. The
problem that I have
is the most famous stalling problem.

I tried already various things that I found in the archives, however it
still has the problem
where the engine runs to rich. I was wondering if you know anybody that
knows anything
about ECU signals and voltage level., maybe even someone has some
schematics.
Looking at the list messages, I think VW Vanagons have a real problem here,
checked with
a lot of other Vanagon folks that had similar bad experiences.

Things I checked or replaced so far:

Grounding points

Aux air sensor harness

temp II sensor

checked VDO idle stabilizer openes only 2mm but is humming (is 2mm  OK?)

Did not replace ECU (I don't think its bad, could be possible)

If you have any other suggestions or maybe you know a good repair shop in
the DC
area let me know.

I just resubscribed to mailing list maybe someone else will report some
other stalling
hints. By the way, your Vanagon WEB page is great, you can be proud of your
accomplish-
ment, having something that serves a real good purpose.


Best Regards!

Ralf
