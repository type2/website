Subject: LONG: 'new' bus, tin, steering &amp; link pins


Used the holiday wisely this year (didn't hurt that we finally had
a stretch of good weather).

Wednesday headed out to Snellville to look at a 65 Kombi in &quot;good
condition&quot;.  Tree limb had fallen on the roof, front nose skin had
bad bondo, but it was fairly solid and a recent runner so I bought
it for $150.  Will rape the best parts for another bus and put an
engine in it &amp; sell it cheap later.  Will make a good knock around
for someone.

Friday pulled out the engine tin for the engine that was in the 
Rust Bug and cleaned it up.  I had never seen an engine as oily as
this one was.  Leaked from the front main seal, oil cooler, generator
stand, push rod tubes, you name it.  Painted the tin &amp; put it back
on the rebuilt engine.  Intake manifold pre-heat tube was clogged 
with built up carbon so I decided I would clean it out.  Had an old
handbrake cable, cut it to length and put it in the hand drill.  Ran
it in turning same way as the cable twist but was not doing much.
Boy genius thinks to himself, &quot;if I turn the opposite direction, the
cable end will unwind &amp; help knock crap loose&quot;.  I proceeded to get
the cable stuck in the tube and it took me about another 45 minutes
to get it back out.  Decided to soak it overnight in engine cleaner
but didn't help (might try Liquid Plumber later).  Ended putting a
good one on it from my stash.  So now I have an engine ready to go
in a bus.

Saturday left early to hit a couple of junkyards but was a totally 
wasted trip.  I decided to work on my neglected front end of the
59 single cab.  The first thing that had to be done was replacing
the main steering pin that transfers the motion from the drag link
to the tie rods.  Removed the top retaining bolt and pulled the old
pin right out.  Knocked out the top bushing with a length of brass 
rod easily, but had to figure out a way to get the bottom one out.
Made a puller out of a threaded rod, 2 sockets, washers and nuts &amp;
it pulled right out.  Cleaned it up, presses the 2 new brass bushings
&amp; then came the hard part... reaming the bushings out to size for the
new pin.  I was a little nervous as the reamer I have doesn't have a
pilot tip, but there really is not that much to ream out so I went 
for it.  Not a problem other than a very uncomfortable position to
do this while lying on your back (next time I take it to a buddy's
shop to put it on the lift!).  Next put the new pin in and align so
retaining bolt goes through the notch in pin.  Much trial and error
getting it in the correct position using a c-clamp.  Tighten bolt
and fill with grease gun.  OK, that's done but only makes up for
half the slop.

Next job: Link pins!
Bottom pin on passenger side very sloppy, tighten, much better!

Drives much better!  No more vibrating passenger wheel under hard
braking, much less play in steering, but another problem is revealed.
Tight spot in steering box.  PO probably over-tightened steering box
when pin was the real problem.

Sunday washed the single cab because everyone has been hassling me
(hey, it's a WORK truck, not a show car!) and because I've only
washed it twice since I bought it last February.  I forgot how nice
it could look!  Like a totally different vehicle.

A couple of friends showed up to borrow tools and work on their bus 
in my yard.  I got them to help me put the windshields and new rubber
into the 66 Deluxe.  I was inside pulling cord &amp; they were outside 
applying pressure.  I warned them to apply pressure gently and evenly,
but we still managed to cause an 1-1/2&quot; crack in the outer layer in the
lower left corner on the driver window.

I then helped them use my abrasive wheel to knock the rust off their
75 Westy.  All in all it was a very productive weekend!

Bus On!
