So Scott Beckstead says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Steve,
&gt; 	I don't want to seem TOO humor impaired but this not being friday 
&gt; and the plea for help genuine I don't find your reply very helpful or 
&gt; indeed advised.  This then is an official flame. Shame on you!
&gt; 

Well... I think I've been on this list long enough and contributed well
enough to make a few smart assed remarks....

I think, if anyone wants me to temper what I say, it should come from
the list master himself... and not some sniveling whiner who seems
to think that they are the ones to dictate what is said on this list
and when....

I new that others would answer the original posters request with
more pertinent answers than the ones I did.  So...if Gerry wishes
me to knock off my infrequent tongue-in-cheek remarks, I will without
question, but until then....

Well... you got my message...

Steven
