&gt;The headlights on my 84 are awfull.  I was thinking of trying to get some
&gt;of the later modelsquare lights from a junkyard but I am told that they are
&gt;not much better.  Has anyone got any bright(!) and preferably economical
&gt;solutions to this problem?

I had the same problem with my 85. I simply bought New Halogen lights to
replace my old Halogen lights. The new ones are significantly brighter.
I bought the standard replacements.The new ones were approximately $15. 
The replacement took 10 minutes.

I've seen some newer Bullet lights on later model cars. They have a 
very small surface lense area, but seem extremely bright. I understand
they might be better in the rain as well. I would mount them on top of
the bumper in a suitable location. Any thoughts?

Finally, any definitive leads on the replacement radiator grill with
driving lights? A la the Rabbits? The last leads in Lenti were a bit
vague.

Hope all is well with you
