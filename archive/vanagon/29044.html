Subject: pfeiffer reunion!  (big sur)


The California Camping Crazies (CCC) wanna do it again.  A suggestion
has been made to hold our first anniversary!:  at the location of our
very first group campout, which took place a year ago January, at the
Pfeiffer Big Sur campground, just about 30 minutes south of Carmel, CA. 
A number of people have expressed interest in going, but we need to
pinpoint some dates.  I assume none of you will be in good enough shape
to do this the last weekend of December (giggle), but how about
Jan 5-7th?

Lemms know.....
