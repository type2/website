&gt;Hi everybody,
&gt;
&gt;  Well, I have my '91 Vanagon Camper in for 60,000 mile service and -- 
&gt;surprise, surprise -- the service guys found oil in the coolant (or was
&gt;it coolant in the oil) and are quite sure I have a small head gasket
&gt;leak. I've heard enough about this on the list that it isn't entirely
&gt;unexpected. :-(  I'm not too pleased, though, since I have always kept
&gt;an eye on the coolant level, used nothing but Autobahn coolant, had it
&gt;flushed and replaced by the dealer after two years and I'm now on a one-
&gt;year schedule for this.
&gt;
&gt;  The service guys are recommending head gasket replacement as soon as
&gt;possible since the worse it gets, the more likely that pitting will
&gt;happen. They are also saying that it is likely that the head will need
&gt;replacing. (No kidding. Wouldn't the head warping be the most likely
&gt;cause for a leaky gasket? Gee, I wonder if the head warping is from
&gt;hot spots due to not &quot;burping&quot; the cooling system after refilling by
&gt;lifting whichever end of the vehicle...)
&gt;
&gt;  Obviously, I'm not too thrilled about paying for a big job like this
&gt;when it's probably due to either bad design by VW or improper work by
&gt;the dealer. One way or the other I will have it done since I love my
&gt;camper! :-)  I thought there was mention on the list of some sort of
&gt;VW &quot;secret warranty&quot; on this, and I even remember something about special
&gt;pricing on a replacement engine for (I think) was this. Does anyone
&gt;remember what I'm talking about?  Please drop me an email if you know
&gt;anything on this...

Find out for sure which way oil/water is going.  Oil in water is usually
caused by an oil coller leaking internally.  It is easy to fix.  If you have
to go for head work, call VW and yell and scream and cuss them out.  They
have repaied many under Goodwill.  Especially with your low mileage.  For
all, yell and scream about heater cores also.
