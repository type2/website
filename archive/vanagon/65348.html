Subject:      Insuring a Camper

A recent post about the Rialta stated that one of its advantages was that
it could be insured as an RV.

I thought that people would like to know that a Westy can also be insured
as an RV (at least with State Farm).  My insurance on the '84 Westy is
about half of what it is for my '86 Jetta.  Many years ago, in
California, the requirements for RV insurance were that it had to have a
bed, a sink, and a stove.  Here in North Carolina, the agent just
processed the RV application without telling me the details.
