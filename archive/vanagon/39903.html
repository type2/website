Subject: Re: Number Detective Work (was RE: Splitty Chassis/dating)

Confusing! If its 12v it must be post '66..what kinda indicators you got?
Are we talking about the plate that says Fahrgest Nr?
SSVC archives tell me that on post 64 vans the first two digits are indeed
model nr (22 = Microbus) and the third digit is the year..but it cant be 1961!
Thw next six digits refer to the actual number built (sequential production)
Sp whats this 1 digit then
I'm confused..is it a 5 or 7..then it would all make sense....
Can you check for me the numbers on the plate behind the cab seat on the
bulkhead? The right bottom seqence should be 7 numbers - a repeat of the
chassis numbers minus the model code...your sshould read 1308189..
Let me know ..I'ask about meantime...anyone out there on the list help out?
