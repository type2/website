So Donald Baxter says:
&gt; 
&gt; I drove it tonight, after a few months of casually looking around I found 
&gt; this one in the paper: 1985 Vanagon GL, 124,000 miles, completely 
&gt; rebuilt engine.
&gt; Physically, the body and interior appear to be in good shape.  The 
&gt; present owner runs a VW repair shop in Tucker, GA.  The only problem he 
&gt; warned me about before driving was steering groan--he said this was the 
&gt; power steering pump.  After researching the gopher site, I'm wondering 
&gt; if the rack might be bad.  At any rate, he has offered to replace the 
&gt; power steering pump.

Definately take him up on the fix offer.

&gt; The asking price is $2,850.  Is this reasonable?  Am I about to make the 

It sounds to me like he's trying to unload it pretty quick.  The bait is
the power steering fix.  Still the $2,850 price is not too bad if the body
is in good shape.  I'd have it checked out at a shop.  Find out what else
is wrong and you can use it as a bargaining chip to negotiate for an even
lower bid if you still want it.  Be sure to have a him show the rebuild 
receipt.  What's the date?  Who did the rebuild?  Whoever did the rebuild, 
find out if anyone else knows the place and can tell you if its a good 
shop or not.
