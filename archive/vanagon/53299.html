Subject: Re: lighting answers

Compatible 55W H3 quartz bulbs are avail. for $10 at FLAPS near me, don't
know about heat factors, likely OK for reverse lights, brakes?  How long do
you sit on the pedal?  You can also get them plus backup beeper built in,
$26, gizmo land.  Hella make a rubber cased work/reverse light with odd
double cup reflector, mounts in rear centre of vehicle, meant to light the
roadway behind each wheel fully, $50-60. Don't know wattage.   Tim
