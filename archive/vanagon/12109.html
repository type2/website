The 25 June meet is not to be missed.  The Scenic City Transporters 
caravaned down last year and it was one of the best meets we have ever 
attended.  Type II's predominate (as it should be) but all sorts of other 
VWs were in attendence.  Parts/swap booths were extremely unlike the NOPI 
show in September, but that's another story.

Want some company on the Blue Ridge?  I will bring it up at the next 
meeting if you want me to.  In any event, we are looking forward to 25 June 
at Southern Tech!

Peace,
