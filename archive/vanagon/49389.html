Subject: Re: Does air cond.=hp loss?

If you're going to be driving on dusty dirt roads in the summer as I 
do, you'll want to keep the windows and hatch closed, or else the dust
will get everywhere inside.  This is when you'll really need the A/C.

I turn off the A/C on some steep mountain grades, but on some 
notorious uphill stretches of southwest desert interstates, I found 
it necessary to turn off the A/C, open all the windows, and turn the 
heaters on full blast (whew!) just to keep the temp guage from going 
critical, as the radiator fan's high speed wasn't enough.
