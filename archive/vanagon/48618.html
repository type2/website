Subject: Vanagon air dam???

Hello Folks,


I was just looking in the J.C.Whitney catalog and I saw a selection of air
dams for all makes and models.  I even saw one for Vanagons, one that would
fit my year.  Has anyone tried one of these or any other manufacturer?  I an
curios as to if I might see any increase in fuel economy ?  I drive about 55
miles each way to work and most of it is at 60 to 65 mph, just to stay with
traffic. Also I wonder if this would effect cooling? Any help on better fuel
economy would be appreciated.  I know slow down a little!!!!

Thanks folks
