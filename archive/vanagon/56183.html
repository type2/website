Subject: Volks-motorsporsts Server Change.

Listees,

  Anyone that tried to reach me in the last 48 Hours, if your mail bounced I'm in the 
middle of switching Servers :)  I'm doing this to make it easier for anyone who's 
trying to reach me.


  If your mail bounced, please try again it seems to be compteted on my end:)

  Sorry to take up bandwidth with this but someone from the list may need this 
message.

  Kyle
