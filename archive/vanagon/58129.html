Subject: Getting tired of derisive postings

One of the joys I derive from this list, besides the humurous stories and
sharing in other's bus problems is the fact that i can actually take refuge
here. Yes, we all have a common interest and share to some degree a bond to
that end. If I was to come over and help render advice about your Vanagon,
et. al.'s problem, the last thing I would do while handing you that lovely
metric wrench is bring up an inflammatory remark about your/our vehicles or
get involved in some arguement about businesses opening just becasue of the
list, etc. 

I come to the list to get away from the struggles of work/life/realities.
Honestly, our babies come with enough problems already.  I want to here
about people's troubles with their machines. Not quibbling.

So I am pleading with the powers that be to nip this increasingly derisive
postings in the bud.
