Subject: obscure? WI bus guy

Howdy.
 
Last week I was considering getting a non-Westy pop top, but some other guy
bought it before I could look at it. Argh.
 
But in my travels for improvements I drove north of Wisconsin Dells (not
through, mind you) to a yard that had some unspectacular busses. That was hiway
13 parts. The yard guy, who had *way* too much fun slaloming through the yard
in a Yugo, told me of a place just up the road.
 
This guy has maybe a dozen busses, from splits to vanagons. He has a small
shop, and is way laid back. You can find him (actually, I don't know his name)
at Sig's Auto Repair, 2702 Hwy 13, Adams WI (608) 339-6569.
