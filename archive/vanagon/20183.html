Subject: Re: query: mexican vans

     &gt;Is it true that vw buses were
     &gt;manufactured in mexico, in the eighties, and were type II's?
     &gt;Do they have upright motors, and in that respect similar to the 71's. 
     &gt;or did i just get my leg pulled a few inches....
     
     this is what I've heard,
     
     Split window buses were manufactured up to about 1975 in 
     mexico/brazil, then the hybrid Brazilian Bus was produced until the 
     early 90's. This hybrid was a 23-window split bus with a bay window 
     front - weird (check it out on my web server http://146.87.136.48 )
     
     They make the standard looking Type II bay window at the moment, but 
     it has a high top  extension of about 10 inches and a VW Passat engine 
     in the back with a radiator added to the front.
     
     Lee.
