Subject: am I imagining things..??`

Fellow listees... I have found lately that the Icebox in my '73 westy
seems to stay colder longer if the water tank is full... is the
freshwater tank right up against the back of the icebox...?? using the
water as thermal mass...??
	Or am I just hallucinatin'....??
