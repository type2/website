Martha quothe:

&gt; 
&gt; The following is an excerpt from a magazine called &quot;Camping &amp; RV&quot; -
&gt; Jan/Feb 1995 issue.  The article is entitled &quot;A Class of Their Own,&quot; and
&gt; is about Class B motorhomes:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Though the Westfalia company ultimately gained the official Volkswagen conversion contract, Sportsmobile retained its proprietary roof retraction mechanism. 
&gt; The apparatus allows the top to extend straight up, rather than merely 
&gt; tip from one end.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Decades of experience has shown that some customer want only the 
&gt; patented, retractable roof mechanism installed in their present family
&gt; van.  Said to be deployable in less than ten seconds, once
&gt; installed, the new pop-up top nets owners 6'9&quot; of usable headroom when  
&gt; needed.
&lt;snip&gt;

That sounds like my pop-top.  My conversion was done by Safare'.  Since
David S. has a Safare' that has a high-top, it sounds like this fits 
the description of Sportsmobile.  Is is possible that one is a rose
by another name?....

BTW, how long does it take to deploy (I love that choice of verbs) the
Westy pop-top?
