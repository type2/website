Subject: Camp grounds near Santa Fe?


&gt;Are there any list members who can recommend or steer us clear of any
&gt;campgrounds near Santa Fe, NM? This particular trip requires showers and
&gt;electricity due to a wedding ceremony that we must attend.

&gt;An initial web search has provided &quot;Tesque RV Campground&quot; 10 miles north of
&gt;SantaFe, NM _at_ 505-455-2661

Most definitely NOT recommended. A dump. Also avoid anything on Cerrillos Road.

Have the operator look up the number of Apache Canyon RV Park, that one's nice.
