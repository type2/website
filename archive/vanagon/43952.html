Subject: EV Camper availability

I took my EV Camper in for its 6 month service today, since I had to run a
few errands in town anyway. Salesman told me that there aren't any more new
ones available - U.S. stock was sold out, and since VW isn't releasing a
new one until the '97 model year, they're starting to turn people away!
I presume he means that there are none sitting on the lot in Iowa, there's
got to be some in the dealer channel yet, hell he's got a new one sitting
in the showroom over there. Usually dealers will trade with each other as
well.
Anyway, just a data point, I'm not sure how accurate.
