Hi Chris,
I paid 3500 a few years ago for my 82 with 92K (on odometer, could have
been more, PO said it was missing about a 1000 miles, speedo did not
work.)  SInce then I put a new tranny and engine in.  I am into it about
7000 now and would not let go of it for less than 6500.  If the inside
is in good shape and good mechanical then you are in the ball park.  If
its a rust bucket or mechanic's special I would say wait.  My $.02
PS: I STILL LOVE MINE! no matter.
Enjoy and good luck.

PSS: they seem to be rising in price from my observation.
