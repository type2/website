Subject: Re: Classified Listings on the Net

&gt;I'm hoping one day to be able to inform the list that I am the proud owner 
&gt;of a Westy, but I've had zero luck finding one.  Does anyone have a listing 
&gt;of newspapers or classifieds that are on the net?  I'm specifically looking 
&gt;for something on the east coast of the US.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;PEJ


East coast no, but there is a Classified Flea Market page for the Bay Area
that always has a few buses in it.  It could almost be used as a benchmark.
