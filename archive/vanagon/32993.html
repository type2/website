Subject: Re: new way to heat food while camping

&gt; &gt;
&gt; I am in the Army National Guard.  The MREs (Meals, Ready to Eat) have an
&gt; packet that is the same thing.  They don't come with the meal, they are an
&gt; accessory.  Just add water and place with the food.  A few minutes later, a
&gt; hot meal!  They work GREAT!  They only problem is when people try to use them
&gt; as personal heaters.  If you place them against your skin, you will get
&gt; burned.

A friend in the Army gave me a little packed (OD Green) that you add 
water to to produce heat (for warming hands, etc.) The harder you press, 
the more heat you get. Reusable. Don't know anything more about it. It's 
probably nuclear or something they took off an alien found in Utah. Clay? 
Are you there? 8) Joe
