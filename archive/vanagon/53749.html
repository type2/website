Subject: Coolant under rear bench carpet

HELP!  I pulled the never-used seat belts up from underneath the rear 
bench seat of my '88 GL today, and was horrified to find them wet with 
coolant.  I imagine there must be some kind of leak from the rear heat 
exchanger.  I seem to remember a thread along these lines a while ago, 
but I'm afraid I might not be able to find it in the archives.  Can 
someone shed some light on what needs to be done?
