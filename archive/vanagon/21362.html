Subject: Re: EV Docs


Moe Walters came up with a great suggestion which I had also toyed
with ... putting the manuals up on the web...unfortunately
having the docs on the web may bring about more attention to the
docs and eventually copyright problems....

Seeing as how I teach a course in computer issues and the law and
am the resident &quot;copyright expert&quot; I wouldn't want the stuff
on the web with any connection to yourstruly
