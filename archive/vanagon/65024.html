Subject:      Re: Westi window screens

&gt;For Plastic screens: just push them out, start at one
&gt;corner. Easy work if rubber sealing and plastic are
&gt;not glued together.

&gt;Why don't change them? A new screen (non pop-out,
&gt;non sliding) will cost only DM 100.- +/- including
&gt;new rubber sealing. Shipping just inexpensive
&gt;during the 'fender lips group purchase'.

Reading all the mails it turns out that the window discussed
is a kind of pop-out. The description above is related to
fixed plastic double-screens for campers. Sorry on this,
there are so many kind of windows available.
