Subject:      Synthetic Oil(s)

Hey folks,

I am sure this topic has been batted around a bit on the list but I was
wondering what the general consensus is on synthetic motor oil vs. regular
oil. It's about that time for our Westy to get relubed and I have been
pondering the pros and cons. Are synthetics beneficial for the Westy?

TIA

Chris
