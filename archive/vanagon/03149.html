Or how 'bout a c program as follows:
*/

void main()
{
	main();
}

/*
And see how long it takes for them to come to a complete stop.  I actually
did this one to a few people at a DG admin class, since some people thought
I was silly when I pointed out that DG/UX installs with non-secure accounts
with root access.  I rlogin'd to their machines, ftp'd the program over,
and put it in their .login.   Tell you this, a 400 series DG workstation
doesn't last last long under this kind of load!

Note: use cc to compile.  CC won't let you get away with this.
