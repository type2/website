Subject: Re: Anyone got a bike rack or towing hitch?

Why not buy a decent Thule or Yakima and mount it vertically on the 
back?? I have seen alot of people do this.  Then you can take advantage 
of all of the other attachments for those racks.... I have a tilting 
rack on the back (my 87 has a tow hitch) as well as a full blown Thule 
system on the camper top.  You can never have enough rack space!  I 
wouldn't bother with the cheapy strap to the hatch solution.  They are a 
pain in the ass and not very sturdy.  Remember you get what you pay for. 
 I have enough money tied up in mountain bikes and windsurfers to 
warrant spending alot of money on the best quality racks to carry the 
stuff.
