Subject: message from Rusty van Bondo


Rusty van Bondo phoned me this morning to ask that I post a message
to the list at large, explaining that his workplace is still having
big e-mail problems, with no fix in sight for the near future.  He
said chances are any mail sent from/to him probably disappeared
for all time, and that he'll probably be getting his own private
non-work related provider in the very near future.
