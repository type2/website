Hi Bill, How are you? I hope just fine! :)

&gt;        Having gotten Little Martha's clutch fixed, I finally concluded the
&gt;deal I struck when I bought her and picked-up the '71 front axle assembly
&gt;the DPO had accumulated to do a disk-brake retrofit.

Sounds like a good deal to me. Of course, you're in CA and i don't really
have an idea about used parts availability there, but '71 disk brakes are
hard to find. I'm pretty sure that it would be *very* difficult to find
a diskbrake frontaxle here in Holland.

&gt;what's a front axle assembly worth? If I can
&gt;pick another up in a year for $100 or less, I might sell this one and
&gt;buy another when I have time to do the retrofit.

You could look into the RMMW catalog and see what the parts cost new:
(and probably not original VW) a fortune. And again due to the fact that you're
in CA, the frontaxle itself will be still like new. I don't know why you'd want
to replace the axle itself though, the only reason i could think of is that
the axle on the car has a different bracket for the master cilinder. If this
is not the case: just swap the master-cilinder/spindles/disks/calipers/etc. in
other words: remove these items from the axle you have and sell or trade the
remains...

&gt;        Guy who sold me the pickup looked at my ECI engine and said
&gt;&quot;Hmmm, D case, that's a late 60s single port I think this came with
&gt;an H case new, but it probably doesn't make much difference.&quot;

D engine has 34 DIN Hp/40 SAE Hp, 1192cc and was built far into the 80s.
The H motor is a 1500 circa 44 DIN Hp, 1493cc. I don't have a book or my d-base
at hand for more info regarding these engines.

I think that (and I would be pretty sure if you Bus was sold in Europe)
your Bus came with the B motor, 1600 SP.

&gt;        Is this right and if so, what difference does a D case
&gt;make versus an H case in a pretty much bone-stock 1600sp with stock
&gt;carb &amp; distributor, extractor exhaust?

The alloy VW used for the 1600 cases was different than what they used for
the smaller engines. Since your engine is pretty much stock i don't think
that there will be trouble due to that in the future.

I know that there is a *huge* worldwide market for AC VW core parts, so the
actual core may have came from who nows where, it could be possible that you
have a 80s mexican 1200 D case, identifiable by the *two* oilpressure
reliefvalves. If it is an early case it will only have one of course.

&gt;I did have it built with GM hydraulic lifters

Interesting...

&gt;I have a Pertronix electronic ignition I'm going to install one of these
&gt;days.

That's on my wish list too

&gt;        He also thought it was misfiring at idle (it doesn't seem
&gt;uneven to me- any opinions how to troubleshoot this?).

Possible causes: valve adjustment: valve sticks open, ignition
timing/points, i would look for things like that.

&gt;        Finally, said DPO, who is a mechanic, said that at the
&gt;300 mile mark on the new engine it would be a good idea to
&gt;retorque the lower head nuts and reset the valves, because it
&gt;probably tightened up. Well, I shouldn't have to do the valves :)
&gt;but retorquing the head makes sense.

Hydraulic lifters can be off as well, but that means that they were
not correctly installed/adjusted to begin with.

Most important is that you retorque *ALL* of the headnuts, even while that
means that you have to pull the engine, do *NOT* only retorque the bottom
nuts just because they are easily accessible, maybe that OK for stretching
the life of an almost worn motor a bit...

Cheers!
Brian
