 The transmission was just rebuilt on my 86 Syncro.  Now, shifting is tight 
 from 3rd down into 2nd and down into 1st.  Generally it is OK strating in 
 1st and shifting into 2nd, though at times it's tight.   Shifting up into 
 3rd is tough sometimes, but it doesn't seem to follow a particular pattern.
 
 Is it possible the first two gears were not aligned correctly? &gt;&gt;


 Were the syncros repalced?  If so they may have to seat before working
correctly.  Also, is the clucth working correctly.  If it is not releasing
completely, difficult shifting will occurr.  Is it also possible that the
shifting improves after warmup?  Maybe the cold weather is making the oil too
thick for the syncros to work correctly. Benefit of synthetics.
  I hope this helps a little.
