Will asked:
&gt;&gt; ###  ...            Does anyone know what a caisson is?            ###

i forgot to tell you guys: a caisson is a very old name for an artillery
canon that was towed along behind a truck (as opposed to the self-propelled
things they have now, that look like a tank). but you know how the military
is: Tradition Is Everything! :)  &lt;hmmmmm. kinda like vw buses, eh?&gt;

&gt;Should someone be keeping track of all of these gems?  I envision a
&gt;karaoke album, to be sold at Dead concerts, full of well-known
&gt;melodies, and song sheets with our most excellent lyrics.
&gt;After the first gold record, we could put out a Laser Karaoke album,
&gt;with our vans/buses lumbering in the background (or even the
&gt;foreground).
&gt;Start videotaping your van!  Become A Star!  If we can't do the
&gt;marketing at Dead concerts, well, there's always cheap time on the
&gt;local cable companies for &quot;infomercials&quot;.  Perhaps we could even get
&gt;some sort of tax exemption if we claim our &quot;business&quot; is really
&gt;a religon. We all religously maintain our buses, don't we?
&gt;Whaddya say?

SOMEBODY (and i won't point fingers THIS time) has been sipping the cooking
sherry! or sniffing the glue! or smoking them 'funny' cigarettes. waaaaaay
round the bend.
