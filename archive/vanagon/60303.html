Subject: Fridge

These comments about filling the already cooled fridge with already 
cooled food make me glad the PO of my westy did something about the 
fridge.  Mine has a Norcold compressor driven fridge.  It runs from 120 
or 12 volts (NOT propane) and will run for several days from the golf 
cart batteries installed under the rear seat.  One day when we went 
directly from my son's birthday party to a ball game, I started up the 
fridge, inserted two hot large pizzas (that was quite a trick) and drove 
off.  Things cooled off fine.  The only downside (other than the cost of 
the fridge and batteries) is that you have to either plug in (recharging 
the batteries with the built in charger that was added also) or drive for 
a while every two or three days of camping.  If anyone would like 
details, I have the instruction book on the fridge and data on the 
batteries.

Bill
