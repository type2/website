Subject: Joel's bosch stuff

Joel, 

This bosch stuff is terriffic! It is so good it begs for us an explaination.
 For example, can we call up any authorized Bosch service shop and order
these parts? How do the prices compare to buying fuel injection parts at a VW
dealer.

I think our next mission is to get the repair manual that authorized Bosch
places would use to repair a Vanagon.

There was a recall on VW's fuel injector seals. Do you think these part
numbers reflect the new upgraded part? I think we are all in danger of having
someone, someday, install the old fuel injector seals out of old stock, thus
endangering our motors.
