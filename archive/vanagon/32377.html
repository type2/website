                        Rincon Rocket Rescue

A couple of weeks ago I mentioned I had acquired another bus. 
The previous owner was the husband of one of my wife's co-
workers.  When they split the blanket six years ago the bus --
his bus -- was part of the booty. 

The bus is beautifully painted and has a luxurious interior but
when the ex-husband learned it would have to stay with his ex-
wife, the engine vanished.  Needless to say, it didn't drive very
well, ex-engine.

Over the past six years the keys have been lost, along with the
registration.  When the woman tried to sell the bus she found she
had an albatross around her neck.  Eventually she decided to junk it
only to discover even the junk yards didn't want it... unless she
paid them to haul it away.  She lives on the Rincon Indian
Reservation, about thirty-five miles from the nearest junkyard. 
She mentioned the matter to my wife, who mentioned it to me and I
eventually agreed to take a look at the bus, thinking the woman
would want to keep it if I could get it running for her.  Wrong. 


&quot;Are you kidding?  I never want to SEE that thing again!&quot;

Monday, after getting back from Big Sur I drove over to the
reservation and took the front bumper off the bus.  Back home, I
dug around under the bench, found some half-inch cold-rolled
steel bar, welded up a pair of brackets and modified a bug tow-
bar to fit them.  Tonight, Roland Wilhelmy and I went back to the
reservation, bolted on the brackets and attached the tow-bar.

Since there was no key Roland dove under the bus and popped lose
the steering link.  I couldn't fit under the thing -- it has been
lowered and wears low-profile tires that puts it about two inches
off the ground.  We rigged some lights, dropped the tow-bar on
the hitch and pulled that puppy outta there.  It proved to be an
interesting trip home.

I towed it with a 1986 Toyota pickup.  The 2200cc engine had no
trouble getting the bus moving but there are five or six miles of
7% grade between here and there, and the 35 miles of road has
only one straight section.  Straight down, for the most part. 
The trip took about an hour but it wasn't at all boring, thanks
to the Sheriff and the fog and the two inches of ground clearance
and having the lights short out and that one little skid...  Best
to go slow when you're wagging an iron tail that weighs a ton and
a half.

My wife dubbed the 1972 breadloaf 'The Rincon Rocket' and expects
me to have it running in a few days.  I just smiled.  It will
probably take that long just to get the pack rats out of the air
ducts.

Anybody know how to unlock a locked steering column without using
a key?  Semi-serious responses only, please :-)
