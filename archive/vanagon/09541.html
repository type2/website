&gt; 
&gt; Voting time!  Possible dates for West Pretour Orgy # 2:
&gt; 
&gt; March 17-19
&gt; March 24-16
&gt; 
&gt; 
  I vote for March 24-16!! I have never had an anti-time experience before! If
  you have a lot of experience with this, I think my project manager could 
  use some help with a few deadlines - some of his employees spend all too
  much time on non-work activities &lt;hee, hee&gt;.
