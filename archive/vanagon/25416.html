Subject: Gas Heater Documentation

Hey, where can I get documentation on the gas heater in my '71 bus? I'd
like to go through mine before really cold weather sets in, but it didn't
sound like there were any really good places to have work done. When I
bought the bus, the PO said the heater worked. She also told me lots of
things I've found to be true from her perspective and false from mine. 
I'm reluctant to fire up the heater until I know more about how it works. 
I'd rather be cold in a bus than warm by a charbroiled breadloaf. Any
pointers toward info will be appreciated. 

Thanks! Joe
