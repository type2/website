&gt;&gt;Tim,
&gt;&gt;I'm on both the Corrado list and on the Vanagon list (can you see the
&gt;&gt;conflict in my life?). I just read that Dennis Haynes asked about a turbo
&gt;&gt;for the wasserboxer.  It would be great if *someone* developed one for the
&gt;&gt;Vanagons. I think the fanatics who own these vehichles would buy them by
&gt;&gt;the van-load.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;However, a more realistic point is that NO ONE has developed any
&gt;&gt;performance enhancing mods for the wasserboxer.  If ever there was a
&gt;&gt;vehicle that needed more power it's the Vanagon.  This is a completely
&gt;&gt;untapped market and if even modest hp gains were attainable (with bolt-ons
&gt;&gt;etc.) the demand would be over whelming.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just a thought...

In a reprint of CARtest magazine from South Africa from perhaps ten years
ago:

VW Turbobus

John Conchie, of Alpine Developments (in South Africa) has intended to
provide the best of both worlds by equipping the watercooled 1.9 liter
wasserboxer motor with a turbo system.  This conversion should be available
through South African VW dealers countrywide.  An unlimited distance one-year
warranty will be offered for those vehicles with under 20,000 km.  The
conversion is as follows:

*Cosworth 7.2:1 low compression pistons
*Garrett PB-03 turbocharger (specially built for this application and
requires no intercooler) mounted below oil level and fed with a special oil
pump similar to the double auto stickshift type 1 oil pump increasing the oil
pump casing 20 mm?
*intake is single centrally-mounted blow-through 36mm Dellorto Twin choke
carburetor (specially built for the Turbobus it is all aluminum for extra
strength)
*the only other differences are, spark plugs,air filter, and accelerator
cable

* 1500 RPM 30% boost
* 2200 RPM 100% boost

* power is increased from 57kW,  to 105kW _at_ 4700 RPM
* torque is increased from 141 Nm _at_ 2600 RPM,   to 272 Nm _at_ 3000 RPM

* 0-61 MPH was 22.8 sec   now 12.99 sec


This article is available in reprint as well as many other Vanagon-only road
test articles from around the world in a book named VOLKSWAGEN bus-camper-van
1979-1989  from Brooklands Road Test books.  ISBN 1 870642 783.  I bought
mine from  Midlife Classic Cars discounted automotive books 4233 Carol Ann
Drive Charlotte, NC 28215   Phone/fax (704) 598-5113  100 pages, pictures on
every page.
