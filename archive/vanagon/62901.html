The 2.2 Legacy should fit without raising the cover. Kennedy Engineered
Products has the parts to adapt this engine to the vanagon. They have also
been working with the state of California to have it smog legal. They also
supply different exhaust pipes that are supoosed to flow better and adapt
to the stock cat and muffler, or their own cat and muffler. I think the
price for the whole kit including a custom air duct comes close to $1500,
plus you need to get the Subaru engine along with several other parts that
Kennedy specifies from the donor car.It can get expensive, but the standard
Subaru engine is 130HP _at_ 137 ft. lbs., and there is a turbo version with
160HP_at_ 181 ft. lbs.  It's also supposed to be a much more reliable and
bulletproof engine than the wasserboxer. I've been looking in the local
papers for a while now hoping to come across someone selling a damaged one.
Kennedy says you should be able to pick up a used engine from the junkyard
for $1000 to $1500.
	Kennedy's number is 805-272-1147. Call them and ask for there
brochure, such asa it is.
