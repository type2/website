Subject:       Re: more heating ideas

Quoth Trace Choulat:

&gt;Actually the airplane has two heating systems, one for the carburetor (to 
&gt;keep ice out) and the other for the cockpit (to give occupants idea that 
&gt;they have heat).  I believe the former is more effective.  

&gt;When you  turn on cabin heat, a fresh air tube is opened, this tube coils 
&gt;through a box that surrounds an exhaust manifold (temps reaching 600F, i 
&gt;think). Inside the box the air in the tube is heated and passed on into 
&gt;the cabin.  At best it takes the chill off.

I've got this great idea, guys!  We somehow fabricate a tube that 
fits over the exhaust manifold, then tap the pressurized air from the 
cooling fan, blow it through this tube where it picks up some of that 
exhaust heat, and pass it into the cabin!  Think it'll work?
