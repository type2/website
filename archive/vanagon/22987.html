Subject: Goin' surfin dudes.

     That's right folks, I'm off down South to catch some surf.
     
     Goin' to Newquay, Cornwall.
     
     Gulp, err, I'm goin' in a hired Ford van though - come on now I don't 
     want to get any dirt on my bus now.
     
     see y'all in a weeks time.
     
     Oh, don't get worried if you email me and hear nothing. 
     
     Oh, and don't worry if &quot;The Samba Server&quot; goes down over the
     next week - there's nothing I can do about it - i'll be surfin'
     
     Lee.

     wanna-pickup!
