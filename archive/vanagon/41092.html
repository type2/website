Subject: 1980 Vanagon Ignition

Here's another question. I just installed a stereo in my Vanagon. Planning
on doing some camping. I'll want to listen to the radio while I'm sitting
around reading. The only way to get the stereo to play is to turn the
ignition to on. At that point all the lights on the dash are on. Is it ok to
leave the key in this position for extended periods of time, or will I need
to rewire my stereo to make it hot all the time?
