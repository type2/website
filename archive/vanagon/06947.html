&gt; then i
&gt; figured out how long it was going to take to go 15,000 miles at 70mph, even
&gt; at 70 mph!!! :)  &lt;for those of you mathematically or calculatorly deprived,
&gt; it's over a week of solid running ... i didn't think my little sears drill
&gt; would hold up!&gt;

	I use a little drill as the vibrator in the dirt sifter I'm using
for the front yard. I put a 1/4-20 bolt through a scrap of 2 X 4 lumber,
approximately centered, and chuck the bolt in the drill. Its sufficiently
out-of-balance to bounce the rocks around in the heavy wire basket when 
all the dirt has gone through... those little drills are *tough*!

	I seem to recall friends using drills to lap valves too, when we 
were all younger...

	Cheers!
