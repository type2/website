Subject:      need EV checked out in cleveland

any listees available in cleveland to give an EV a cursory check in
cleveland before i fly there to look at it myself.  just want to make
sure it won't be a waste of time,  not looking for an in depth
inspection.  still looking for a low mileage EV

cheers
