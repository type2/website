Subject: Re: I'm confused about '79s

I've definitely seen 79 bay window buses around (perhaps vanagons were 
introduced late in 79) and they still had the panels behind the front seats. 
I'll have a good look at some at the next show I go to.

&gt;
&gt;1)  Sliding side windows introduced (replacing swing vent windows)

Woah! I've never seen these either, only the swinging vent windows.
