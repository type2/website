&gt;   Has anyone else out there heard that westy's in the US are prone
&gt;   to tipping to the left on left turns because of so much of the weight
&gt;   of these things being on the left side of the van (kitchen, etc.)?

It even looks funny sitting there slightly haunched to the driver's side...

&gt;   If so, does anyone have any brilliant idea about how to prevent
&gt;   this potential?

Lean.
