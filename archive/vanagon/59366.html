Subject: Re: slow throttle response  

Hi Ronald and list members

I am still having the same slow throttle response as before, but having
driven the vehicle for several hours on the weekend, I have noted that the
problem occurs ONLY after about 1 min idling. A stop at the traffic lights
will do it. But if I put it in neutral (I have an auto) and keep the revs
at about 1200, then back to idle and Drive, then take off, everything works
fine.

Does this indicate a temp sensor overheating at idle? 

Any ideas from the guru's

&gt;Hi Scott.. Saw your  March 24 Vanagon list post while scouring archives
&gt;looking for possible fix ideas of same problem you stated... Starts fine; but
&gt;Slow response after warmup.. My 89 GL auto acts like it's only running on 2
&gt;cyls until upwards of 3000 rpm, and then, all's well.  
&gt;
&gt;Last summer I replaced ECU,  I just recently replaced heat sens., O2 sens.,
&gt;plugs, rotor, dist cap... so now I'm thinking it's in my intake air sensor or
&gt;throttle valve..
&gt;
&gt;Could you please tell me what if anything fixed your problem?  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any help you can offer...
