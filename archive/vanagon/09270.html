Having replaced a bulb on my dad's Rabid last year, I have to add that the
Bentley manual was juuuust a little bit off in its instructions.
It was correct up to the point where it said to pull the cluster out and undo

which, of course, leads you to approach it from below and behind, affording you 
the opportunity to try out several new positions for making out in a car.

Thankfully, it sounds like one does not have to do this in a Vanagon.
