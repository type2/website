&gt;Trip Planning???

&gt;Everybody,
&gt;
&gt;I have been using 2 programs for several years by the Delorme Company: Street
&gt;Atlas USA  and AAA Map 'n 'Go.  They are both fantastic programs for a very
&gt;low price (under $45 each).
&gt;

Yeah, in fact I was trying to load it - haven't done so in awhile - and it
proceeded to lockup my machine - couldn't even throw a debug interrupt!
this is the first serious incompatibility i've seen with OS8 - i'm hoping
its just a fluke.

&gt;
&gt;BTW,  I just finished 2 trips from Seattle to Colorado Springs using the
&gt;above programs.  The preferred route from the Seattle area to the proposed
&gt;camping site is through Yakima.  It took me apx 8 hours to get to Caldwell,
&gt;ID which is about 2 hours past the camp site if I remember correctly........
&gt; The AAA Map 'n 'Go program will print out those neat AAA strip maps for you
&gt;IN COLOR!!!
&gt;

True, looking at a more accurate mileage count i see that:

Seattle -&gt; Ellensburg is 107 miles / 1:52 hours
Ellensburg -&gt; Pendleton is 168 miles / 3:27 hours
Pendleton -&gt; La Grande is 51 miles / 1:00 hours
La Grande -&gt; Union is 11 miles / :20 hours
Union -&gt; Catherine Creek is 10 miles / :20 hours
total from seattle is  347 miles /  somewhere between 6-7 hours

La Grande -&gt; Caldwell is approx 109 miles more

And of course you're on an Interstate until  La Grande, so you're quite
right - lock in that cruise control and settle back for a long day of
driving!

In my case, add another hour for ferry traffic. and in any case, i'm sure
the baby's going to meltdown before 6 hours are up so it will probably take
me even longer for a rest stop. Hence it's still possibly two days for me
at least.
