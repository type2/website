Subject: tire rotation on syncro

I'd like to begin a 5-tire rotation on my syncro so that I can get some
mileage out of my spare. I realize that syncros require identical size tires
on all four wheels to prevent viscous coupler damage. Is there any risk in
putting my brand new spare on when the other tires have about 10K miles on them?
