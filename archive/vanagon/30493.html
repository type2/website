Subject: Re: Another one with an anti-freeze leak.

&gt;Just noticed this morning a few drips of coolant on the bracing under the
&gt;engine of the '87 Syncro GL.  This was after a -10 night (-54 wind chill).

If the water jackets shrank enough due to cold to let it leak, likely the 
rubber is hardened from both cold and age, and couldn't compensate for the 
shrinkage.  Maybe re-torqueing the heads is required. This may be a new data 
point for H2O boxers, what is the age of your engine/heads?  Once you get 
coolant under the gaskets you are setting yourself up for crevice corrosion 
and the pits, and providing a path for water to squeeze through.  Tim Smith
