&gt; I'm still looking for a source for a good nose protector for my 85 vanagon.
&gt; Anyone have any leads?

Hi Barry,

Just got back from a mini-vacation in San Diego.  No we didn't take
the bus.  We flew down.  It was great! 

Anyway,  I've been using the original one I bought at VW.  It's an
Autobahn brand.  It's takes less than a minute put on and remove.
It's just now starting to get small tears in the material but I
think it's done a good job.  Kind of expensive though.
