&gt; &gt; Level it by raising the sagging rear back up to it's proper height...
&gt; &gt; That would, however be &quot;fixing&quot; it and not a sano customization, so you 
&gt; &gt; may not want to go that route.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Uhhhhhh, what does &quot;Sano&quot; mean, anyway.  I just drive a camper that has
&gt; about 5 inches from the top of the tire to the bottom of the fender.  I
&gt; don't do sano bithin rad hip hop hype mac daddy anything.

Woah, 
Re-reading my note to you I found that it sounds quite rude.  This was 
not my intention, and I wish to appologise to you if you found it to be 
less than friendly.
I was attempting to poke fun at people who do know what sano means (no, 
I don't either) but in re-reading my note it looks like I was taking a 
poke at you personally.

I was serious about raising the rear though, stiffer coils would 
probably be cheaper than a new front end/spindle assembly.

Again, sorry if I sounded offensive, I should have dropped a :) in there.
and best of luck with your levelling
