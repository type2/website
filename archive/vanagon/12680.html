&gt;Yeah, Thom, I saw this too. Were my eyeballs scrambled, or was that a bay-window
&gt;style bus with rear corner windows? (a-la 23 window style...)
&gt;
&gt;If that was the case, I might consider shooting the dude to take his bus too! ;}

I didn't get a look at the front, but it definitely had the corner windows
and the extra side windows.
