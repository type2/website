&gt; I wonder if this might have been used to create a crude air compressor,
&gt; with two cylinders getting no spark, instead returning air.
&gt; 
&gt; While we're on the topic, does anyone have any info on using a VW engine
&gt; in-tact as an air compressor? Is it possible to screw a fitting into one
&gt; of the spark plug holes and inflate a tire (without hurting your engine)?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks! Joe

Not too long ago I ran into a guy on a motorcycle out on the Blue Ridge 
Parkway and I asked him what he does in the event of a flat tire.  He 
pulled out a patch/plug kit like they have at any gas station and a hose 
that does exactly what you describe above.  he takes out a spark plug, 
disconnects something on the ignition and then holds in the &quot;start&quot; 
button.  he said he found it in the back of some motorcycle magazine...
