Wow!

Those were great.  I thought for a second that the story about the
generator light was written by Carlos Castenada.  (Gee, I wonder how I
got that idea.

The one about the description of owning a bus was a real tear jerker.
I couldn't describe the feeling any better if I tried for the rest
of my life.

Thanks Joel.

Oh, by the way, I don't know how you get so much time to do all this
typing and research, but I want a job just like yours. ;)
