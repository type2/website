Subject: Thanks and goodbye

Thanks everyone for the advice and inspiration.  Now that school is out, I am
going home to where I don't have a computer :(  I'll be back in the fall and I
hope to have a new bus by then, so I'll probably still need advice and 
inspiration!
Thanks, and have a nice summer
Amy :)
