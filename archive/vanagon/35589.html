&gt;Now that my vanagons head gaskets are fixed I plan to take it for a 
&gt;test drive from Michigan to California. Unfortunately, I do not have a 
&gt;cruise control. 
&gt;
&gt;Do you have tips how to add... 
&gt;
&gt;a) a mechanic throttle? (I already tried a brick) 
&gt;b) an electronic cruise control? If so, where could I buy one?
&gt;
I've added cruise control to my 87.  I got it from JCWhitney. It is Zemco
brand and has three little switches in a little square &quot;pod&quot;.  It fit very
nicely just in front of the steering wheel on the plactic steering column
cover.  It has worked very well.  I'd previously installed similar models on
an 84 Rabbit GTI abd an 81 Rabbit Diesel pickup.
