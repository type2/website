Subject: Vanagon Parts

Dear listees,
    I just recieved the used parts that I ordered from Erik O.  I would like
to say that I got a great deal on the parts from Erik. Although I have no
personal intrest in his business deals I would highly reccomend checking out
what he has to offer.  Check out his web page at
http:gozips.uakron_dot_edu/~koesel/SMT. Once again thank you Erik.
                                          Chris
                                       86 Westy
