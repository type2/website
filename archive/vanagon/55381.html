Subject: Family Camper Contact Information

Hi all,
	Had a request to post the contact information about the Country 
Homes Camper guy I have been dealing with in San Jose.  Here is his 
business card:

			Country Homes Camper
			493 Reynolds Circle
			San Jose, CA 95112
		408-441-6280  --  Fax 408-441-6282

		We Build the Best Mini Van Campers

			*Astro		*Aerostar
			*Vanagon	*Eurovan

		Salim Assad				Proprietor

I've only seen his demos and he hasn't done any work for me yet so, of 
course, all disclaimers apply.  He does seem knowledgeable though.

E-mail me if I can help in any other way.

Thad
