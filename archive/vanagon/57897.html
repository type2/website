&gt;I have a Philips DC-777 AM/FM/SW/Cassette radio.  They are no longer
&gt;available.  When it was installed, it was necessary to run two more
&gt;wires back to the rear speakers because the VW radio was grounded
&gt;differently.  The installer skillfully used the same ceiling route as
&gt;the other two wires that were already connected, other installers
&gt;might not care and will string wires back there under the floor.

Philips still produces SW Radios but not the DC-777. I just got a
special offer for a FM/AM/LW/SW with CD-Player for DM 400.- but
can not remember which model. Independent of what VW does, you should
run two wires between the radio and a speaker independent of it's
grounding. Most radios have differential driven speakers.
