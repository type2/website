&gt; I any of you out there owns a Barndoor (pre-55 type 2, not a real barn =
&gt; door). And would like to add them to the Barn door registry, please =
&gt; email it's details.
&gt; Currently the registry has about 160 entries world wide.

&gt; You will be able to view some of the registry on my homepage &quot;Strictly =

Ya know, this is the _third_ barndoor registry I know of:  Peter Valentin,
Dave Heard, and this one.

Of course Dave Heard's registry is just a scam to find out where all
the barndoors are...  He doesn't let anyone else in on the info.

Yes, thats SOTO and &quot;Transporter Talk&quot; Dave Heard.
