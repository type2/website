&gt;Just passing along ...

&gt;1980-91 Vanagon repair manual.
&gt;Covers all models of vanagon; syncro, camper etc.
&gt;Retails for $75. This one is brand new. I will sell for $50 
&gt;plus costs of shipping. (boston)


That's a great price. It actually retails for $95, not $75. Someone ought 
to grab it fast.
