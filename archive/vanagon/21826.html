Subject: Re: Syncro cv boots

Wow Lous. What a piece of mail. 

I'll remember Toyota Corrolla 16V outer. 

I've already wanted to connect up with somebody running a Syncro out of
South Africa (I assume that is where you are). I suppose you were searching
the Vanagon gopher for old mail. Are you on the Vanagon mailing list? I
haven't seen you post there. 

Be advised that VW has migrated to a brand new CV joint boot which is blue
in color and made out of some kind of poly substance. But $180 is laughable.
(Did you convert this figure into American $$?). I think I paid about US$60
for an aftermarket LOBRO front CV joint kit. Keep in mind that you are
supposed to replace the front axel nut and numerous other parts up front
there if you are going to change the boot so a boot usually comes as a &quot;kit&quot;
with other small parts. 

As far as I can tell, I am the world's most enthusiastic off-roading owner
of a VW Syncro van. I have done lots of mods to it to make it better for
this purpose. 

Do you run the same gear ratio as we do here? (4.86) And do you run, like
25&quot; tall tires? 

I'd like to get ahold of a parts microfiche from South Africa so I can
compare the part numbers and see what things are different. If you like, I
could send you some from the USA. VW dealers typically say these are secret
and won't give them out but one out of every four dealers will give out an
expired microfiche if you just ask. Also, what do you use for a repair
manual down there?

Do you have the 16&quot; version of the syncros in South Africa? Or only those
with 14&quot; wheels.

&gt;Hi Derik 
&gt;I read your mail on the front outer cv boot.
&gt;I had to replace  mine recently and the agents wanted $180 for it.
&gt;This was to expensive for my taste and I did the following.
&gt;
&gt;I borrowed the boot from the agents and went auto shop crawling.
&gt;At one shop they were very nice to me and allowed me to go through 
&gt;all of the boots for various motor cars and what do i find?
&gt;A CV boot the same size with the same iner and outer diameter or the 
&gt;original. This bbot even looked stronger than the original.
&gt;I bought it for $10 . (Toyota corrola 16V outer).
&gt;Regards 
&gt;Louis van Wyk
