Subject: PRICE FOR 95 EV

-- [ From: stevek * EMC.Ver #2.5.3 ] --

 Please help.  I just looked at a 95 EV, 5 speed manual trans with 78,
000 miles.
The asking price is $19,000.  I tried to use the Kelly Blue book online,
but they don't seem to handle VW EV's.  The stove and refrigerator
appear to be unused.  I am concerned about the milage.  The paint
doesn't have a speck on it  which makes me wonder how it got the milage.
	Any help will be appreciated.  TIA, Steve kammerer-
