Subject: air flow meter electrical question

okay geeks and geekettes-- 
time to cash in all that time you've spent 
studying schematics and soldering instead of tipping over outhouses 
and becoming team stars.  here's a puzzler:

Why would a simple resistance test on the wiped output of an air flow 
meter jump all over the place yet measurement of the output voltage 
from the wiped output be smooth and linear as the wiper arm is moved?

i've been TOLD this is the case.  measured and found this IS the 
case.  does having a voltage present align the carbon granules with 
forces of the universe causing obediance?  if so, could the same 
principle be used on recalcitrant co-workers?

--uh, whatever.
