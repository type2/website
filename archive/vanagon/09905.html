Subject: Good Parts Places...


All-

	I was browsing Skip Montanaro's excellent web page, and found 
the listing of parts places- this is a great collection of info.

	There are two other parts places I'd like to call to the 
attention of late Bus, Vanagon, and Eurovan owners:

	NEW DIMENSIONS 
	2240 De La Cruz Blvd
	Santa Clara, CA 95050
	(408) 980-1691

	New Dimensions specializes in parts and service for A1/A2/A3 
Golf, Jetta, etc., but they are a Bosch authorized FI service shop and 
have been very nice about ordering Bosch parts for me. Their Bosch 
parts prices are excellent, and they do mail/phone order.

	WOLFSPORT
	1453 4th Street
	Berkeley, CA 94710
	(510) 525-0157

	Wolfsport also specializes in parts for Golfs, Jettas, etc, 
but they carry a good selection of Bosch ignition and FI parts, Boge 
shocks, VDO gauges, brake rotors, pads, etc. for late buses and Vans.
Their prices are good, and they also do mail/phone order. 

	Hope that someone finds these useful!

	Ian Abbott
	'69 VW Beetle
	'87 VW GTI
	'88 VW Vanagon
