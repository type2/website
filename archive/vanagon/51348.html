&gt; 
&gt; Hi
&gt; I seem to be in between the air cooled and water cooled news groups. I have
&gt; a beetle fitted with a 2.1 Wasserboxer(vanagon) I currently run twin 46 ida 
&gt; Webers Berg cam and rockers 10.5 compression ratio  about 160bhp. I am 
&gt; setting up an IHI turbo with Haltec injection and water cooled intercooler 
&gt; (like the liberty) should be good for 250-300 bhp at 15psi boost. Is there 
&gt; anyone out there playing around with these also i cannot find much on the 
&gt; net about Wasserboxer/Vanagon engine..
