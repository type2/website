Subject: preventing theft

After reading a few stories of car and van theft on the VW USENET
groups, I'm wondering what people on the list are doing to minimize
the risk of theft.  I realize that a determined thief will get your
vehicle, no matter what.  But how to best deter the small time
hotwire and smash 'n grab variety? 

Alarms, hidden cutoff switches, steering wheel locks, or just 
&quot;fuggedaboudit?&quot;  I know we're not driving Testarossas here, but I'd 
like to hang on to the vehicles I have.

Ideas?  Experiences?  I've been fortunate not to have been a victim 
of any vehicle related crime, so statistics would say I'm due.  :-(
