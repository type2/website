     Peter-

     This seems to be the factory badge for German and other Vanagon
     campers including Westfalias.  On a bit of a lark (never imagining I'd
     be able to afford a Westfalia), I bought one at the dealer in
     Kaiserslautern in the mid-eighties - now all I have to do is find that
     &quot;Safe Place&quot; where I stored it so I can put it on and be &quot;unique&quot; here
     in New Mexico.
