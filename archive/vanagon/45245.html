Moved into a new neighborhood in 1980. We're talkin' NEW subdivision. The
hoser next door neighbor immediately jumps up on his hip-pitch style roof
and paints it with this white gooey marshmellow cream stuff! It was **SO**
white when new, that the house seemed to literally glow from 1/4 mile down
the street! It must have saved him the same amount of money on his utility
bills that he devalued my property value! My thoughts were &quot;Oh great,
Welcome to the 'hood.&quot;
