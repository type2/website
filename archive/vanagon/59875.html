&gt;I have this problem(?) with my 84 GL....sometimes it's one side of the

motor 
&gt;or drive the van with this stuff in.

&gt;I've done this three times now, and I've found it makes a big difference in 
&gt;smoothing out the motor and improving mileage.  The only question I really
have 
&gt;is why so much crud builds up in only 3000 miles.  If anyone wants the
name of 
&gt;this stuff, I'll try to dig it out.

One of the reasons I'm personally devoted to using synthetic oil is the
cleanliness of the inside of the engine that results.  My longest test to
date is a Nissan bought new in '86, &amp; after break-in I used Red Line for
the 1st 50k miles, got smart after talking to a professional race engine
builder &amp; switched to Mobil 1 for the next 100k, at which point (when I
sold it) the interior was literally like brand new; not a speck of varnish
or carbon visible under the valve cover or in the crankcase (pulled covers
for seal replacement).  My daughter &amp; I rebuilt a Rabbit motor last year
(135k) &amp; the story was the same.
