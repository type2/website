Subject: RE:Mid-Atlantic Camp Out-wordy

I had a blast at the camp out, and met some really cool people.
I thought I'd share some about my trip there and back.  I've had this 
camper for only about two months and have been working on it a couple 
of times a week, inside and out.  I got to the campground kinda late 
because of a discombobulated tire and stuck caliper.  Apparently my 
right front tire started to disentegrate from the inside-out.  I just 
had my breadloaf inspected about 10 days ago so they looked fine then.  
The cords on the inside of the tire started to separate, giving it a 
rather odd shape while still holding air.  The resul= put on spare-no 
biggie.  While I had it up on the jack i went to check the other front 
tire.  It looked good but when i tried to spin it around- it wouldn't 
move!?!  Off with the; tire-the caliper piston(?) was stuck.  I took a 
screwdriver and worked it back and forth using that and the brake pedal. 
Everything OK- drive on.  About 10 miles from the campsight my horn 
starts blowing whenever it wants so I pull over and disconnect it.  No 
more problems till after the campout about 20 miles from home.  The 
other front tire went, same thing!  This is after I already checked it 
on the way there.  Plenty of tread, no visible damage.  I and my 
mechanic checked out my front end today it's fine, just crap tires (came 
with the van).  As I was coasting to the side of the road to change it I 
hear this clank-a-clank.AGHHHHH.  I pulled off my right rear hubcap and 
there is a lugnut rolling around!  How did it come off,why are we here, 
what's the circumference of the earth? I know not.
After my little brother shows up with ANOTHER spare tire and ALL lugnuts 
are checked I'm ready to roll. NOT SO FAST BUSTER!  Turn the key it no 
wanna start!  At this point I am no longer frusrtated, and have resigned 
my fate.  Actually the starter was just hung up, no big deal.  Finally, 
made it home after about 4.5 hours on a 2.5 hour trip.  Not too bad for 
a 71 campmobile that hasn't seen the highway since 1992.

LESSONS LEARNED:
	1.  BRING GOJO
	2.  DONT EVER BUY/USE SEARS ROADHANDLER 45'S 
	3.  MAYBE A 5 HOUR ROUNDTRIP ISN'T A GOOD TIME TO TEST YOUR     
        UNKNOWN VW FOR THE FIRST TIME!
	4.  Don't worry it'll all work out in the end.
