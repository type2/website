Subject: need a back-up light switch
Date: Sun, 03 Nov 1996 23:21:44 EST

Hey all,
I believe that the back-up light switch on the transmission on my '81
Westy is bad.  The symptoms:  The backup lights will come one but only
if I hold the shifter lever all the way up in reverse.  If I take my
hand off the lever and let it rest in its normal spot, the lights go
out.  

Now, would this be a switch problem or what?  I guess a way to test
would be to pull the wires off the switch and ground them.  If the
lights come on, the switch is faulty, right?

Anybody have any ideas of what else it might be?  If it's the switch,
where can I get a new one?  I haven't seen them in the WCM catalog and
there are no foreign FLAPS around here.  Does RMMW have a Vanagon
catlog?  Where do you Vanagoners get your parts?

Thanks for all the help (this should be relatively simple to fix
compared to the sink :)

Take care,
Sean
