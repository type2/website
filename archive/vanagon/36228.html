Subject: Re: Factory Fuel Injection

&gt;Anybody out there Know about factory fuel injection on my 1800cc
&gt;Type IV engine?

A little bit; I have one myself.

&gt;The car is not getting fuel.

The double relay is a (3/4&quot; by 3/4&quot; by 2&quot;) device in the engine compartment
on the left-hand side of the fire wall, with 2 multiple connector plugs; it
should click when the engine is being cranked. There are also two fuses
that could be at fault. Disconnect the battery ground strap before you
replace the relay.

&gt;Also, should I just trash the injection system and buy carbs?

No, I wouldn't do that. Although FI problems can be VERY frustrating, they
are relatively rare and I still believe that FI is a superior design to
carbs. I suggest you buy or borrow a book such as &quot;how to tune and modify
Bosch fuel injection&quot; by Ben Watson and read the chapter on the L-jetronic
system of your '75 bus. Just an opinion, of course.

PS: if you decided to move to carbs anyway, I'd be willing to buy your FI
parts for spares :)
PPS: there's a good mechanic in your area: Callaghan's (sp.?) in Blue
Springs, MO, if I remember correctly. I was there 4-5 years ago, while
moving from CA to MO. They do both Porsche's and VW's.
