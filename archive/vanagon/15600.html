So John Anderson says:
&gt; Well, I might get kicked off for this but this weekend I
&gt; borrowed dad's '87 Caravan to move some stuff and what

First, your right, you should be booted off the list.  ;p

----  Lot's of blah-blah exstolling the wonder-full handling
      virtures of the Cara-shitbox as opposed to the woefully
      outdated wobbly vanagon.  -----  Deleted.

Tell me, friend John, after you've weaved in and out of traffic
to get to your favorite camping spot, whereth will you put all
of your travel canyons to bed?  Out in a primitive tent, pray tale?
What!  Why what a barbaric and crude out-dated way to spend an
evening trying to rest after all of that spine-tingling, break
neck twisting and turning through the curves.  Tisk-Tisk.

And where, dearest John, do you plan to cook the evening meal?
Outside?  Even in the rain.  How absolutely primitive can you
be?  While I'm inside at my stove staying completely dry, you're
out in the elements cooking you're bangers over an old has-been
cook-stove, while I'm inside cozy as can be cooking over a built
in range, with plenty of room inside to move around and a two  
tables to serve up each course of the meal?

Do those fast curves still sound great to you?  

Well, you can enjoy you're low center of gravity while I enjoy my
camp site facilies.
