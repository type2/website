Subject: Federal Cross-Over pipes FS!

I have the Cross-over pipes for the Federal Air-Cooled Vanagons!

  I wanted to let the list know this because these pipes were virtually unobtainable 
before.  These pipes are made VERY well, they fit perfect (I've installed one) and the 
price is decent (250.00) compared to that of VW&quot;s 450.00 (If you can find one).

  Anyone that wants more info on these pipes, or want a pipe e-mail me.

  Kyle
