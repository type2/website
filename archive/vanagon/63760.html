     You have a bad ignition switch. Try running a wire from the 
     +B to the + side of the coil.

&gt; Greetings from Canada

&gt; 	I'am at the end of my rope. My 86 double Cab hasn't run since late June. 
&gt; It just quit on the way home one evening it would start but won't keep
&gt; running.  I cleaned the grounds up and away we went for a coupla miles.
&gt; Then she quit altogether.  I found there was no spark. I replaced the spark
&gt; plugs, rotor, dist cap and one spark plug wire.    then the was no fuel.  
&gt; so i took the harness apart and fix the multiple ground connection at the
&gt; front of the engine, the fuel came back.   But still no spark.  I rang out
&gt; wires to the ECU, cleaned the coil connections tested the coil as per
&gt; bentley OK.   brings me to the Hall sender  I tried testing it with a
&gt; multimeter(digital Fluke 77) but didn't get a blip. Bentley says to use a
&gt; digital probe.  I also did the ground the center lead of the plug to the
&gt; hall center to get 4.5Volts across the coil and didn't get change in
&gt; voltage.   I tested all the other switches and the air box and all appear 
&gt; OK.   As i type this it seems like i have to bite the bullet and replace
&gt; the ECU.   I am not too enthsiastic about this as the ECU was replaced 2
&gt; years ago and i feel that these should last the life of the vehicle and not
&gt; less then the life of the exhaust pipes. Any advice or suggestions would be
&gt; welcome.
