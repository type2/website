&gt;Where can you get a fan switch that activates at a lower temp? Does anyone
&gt;have any part #'s?
&gt;
&gt;

I can get these for you. My specialty supplier keeps them in stock for me. I
should be able to provide them for about $30.00 plus shipping.  I will
confirm price and post on list.  Anyone interested should E-mail me directly
for my address and phone.
Dennis.
