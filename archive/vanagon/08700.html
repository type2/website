&gt;in where he could keep an eye on us.  Ever seen a bee drunk?  I have.
&gt;When the grapes die on the vine they ferment.  The bees love it.  Then
&gt;the kinda sway back and forth hovering over the ground.  It's pretty
&gt;funny to see.

never seen an intoxicated insect ... but i've seen blasted birds and a
drunk horse. Never Eat Fermented Oats. :)  also a drunk chicken. but we
did that on purpose. ;)

&gt;Anyway.  Your right.  Not everyone has access.  So will sell the books
&gt;at $100.00 a pop.  Sounds fair don't it? ;)  I thought so.  We could

nononononono. that's way too much. more like $20. if any costs at all.
which probably means it's not 'do-able'. but the point of my 'nagging
thoughts' was to do kinda what Muir did, but more specifically for buses:
get the info out to more people. spread it around.

but i guess, what with the Funkengroovin' and the LiMBO, NEATO, SOTO and
all the other paper publications, and the various mailing lists and
newsgroups, it'll all work out. maybe it will 'come together' in a couple of
years. if everybody gets WWW and that sort of Mosaic access, it would be
something to see. especially if you could SEE and crawl virtually through
the engine or body or whatever that you were trying to learn how to fix.
