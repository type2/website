Subject: RE: building your own oil temp gauge.

Chris Bridge builds his own gauges.  Golly, Chris, I thought *I* was 
cheap.  Well, at least you get a product that people can see.  When I 
cleaned, stretched, and reused old pushrod tubes I couldn't even show
anyone.

Has anyone calculated what they pay themselves in the garage?  I've
never done the calculation 'cause I'm afraid of the damage to my
self-esteem.
