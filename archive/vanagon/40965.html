All,
	Years ago I ordered rebuilt steering knuckles from Busboys.  The 
parts came and were very satisfactory.  I UPSed the old cores to Busboys 
and never recieved my $100 core deposit back.  I wrote and called busboys 
and was basically blown off.  UPS claims to have delivered the core.  
Wow!  Last year  and 60,000 miles later, I removed both knuckles and 
cleaned up the link pin bearings.  They still looked new and the king 
pins felt tight.  About half of these miles were on dirt and I was 
impressed.  The quality of the parts were good even though the service 
sucked, not to mention the fact that they still owe me $100.
