Subject: Re: How to fix rust below windshield (was: Back and ready...)


&gt;It would be great if some aftermarket company, or courageous entrepreneur,
&gt;would start manufacturing a metal panel that replaces the 6&quot; of metal below
&gt;the windshield, including mounts for the wiper pivots. I've never heard of
&gt;this being reproduced, but I'll bet there is a big market for it-- almost
&gt;as big as for Bug rear floor pans! Anyone ever seen such?

Alan Schofield in England makes these panels. They are about 30UKp for the 
set (3 pieces) but they are a bugger to fit. He also sells complete front 
panels for about 90UKp which looks like a bigger job but is much easier. I'm 
about to fit one of these so I'll let you know how it goes. I'm pretty sure 
one or other of Bus Boys or RMMW sells Alan Schofield bits, Lee might know 
which one.
