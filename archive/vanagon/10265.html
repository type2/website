Tom,

The 87 will be well past the tech update of the hose connector and bleed 
screw, so they might be the culprits but not with so much probability as 
if you were looking at an early 85 model.  My 85 model built in Dec 84 
has the new parts and the smell, as well.  I fear a heater core leak 
because I've inspected the bleed screw adn hoses carefully adn find no 
leaks on them.  Hope they're the problem, anyway.  Hate to have to 
replace the heater core.  Mine does not smell when the heater is turned off.
