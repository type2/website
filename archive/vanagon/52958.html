Subject: please make my vanagon run again

sorry for not know ing your name , i had a problem suchas yours witha 56 vw
single cab. try putting the van in nuetral and push front to back than put
in gear and see if iit will roll. the problem i had is the clutch, and
pressure plate all stuck together and i had to actually pull the motor and
pressure plate to break it free. does the motor urn over at all or solid.?
is the starter engaged and jammed on the teeth of the flywheel? does the
starter turn but no motor turn? sorry if ive asked the same ? as others i
kind of trashed to many e-mails at once and lost many? 
hope this somewhat helps later Jonce

56 single cab
66 bug
