Man, I don't know about the water-pumpers, but I had an 80 westy a few
years back that I had to do extensive engine work on.  I spent well over a
grand in parts alone and did the work myself.  I can't believe that a
complete engine (except for the odd used one with low miles from a wrecker)
can be properly done for that little money.
