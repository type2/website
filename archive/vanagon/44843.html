Howdy folks,

Well I'm adding another rusty Pa. bus to my collection- a 1966 euro
panel/homemade ambulance! A real beast,it's olive drab green(brush
painted) with spotights and sirens on the roof. Good points- 45,000 km,
mint blade bumpers, euro tailights. Bad points- 18&quot; of tin riveted the
WHOLE way around the bottom of the body! Oh well, at least it turns
heads!

See ya, 
RJ.
