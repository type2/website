Subject: Late Westy Camper wanted near NYC
Date: Mon, 28 Apr 1997 19:47:55 -0400

A couple were very interested in the '89 Westy I had for sale, but their
bank hemmed and hawed over their loan application forever, and by the time
it finally came through, I had just sold the van a few hours earlier.  I
feel badly because they are really nice people and were very hopeful about
my Westy.  

So if anyone near NYC or New England has a late model Westy for sale for
the $9-12k range, or knows of one, please let me know the details and I'll
pass them your info.  They are ready to buy right away.

Thanks,
