Subject:      Re: extended warranties

For Trace Choulat:
                  I bought an Extended Warranty from GE Capitol (The same
people who make lightbulbs) from the dealer at cost for $435.00. It extends
the 2-year VW Warranty coverage to 6 years/75K miles. So far I've claimed
twice and they've paid up no problem. They seem to be a good organization
to work with. I would shy away from no-name companies. Why not write GE
Capitol///actually call their 800 number. I don't have it here but you
should be able to get it by calling 800 information (1-800-555-1212).
