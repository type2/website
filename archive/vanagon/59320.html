Subject: Oil in Gas? UPDATE CUBED X3

LATEST UPDATE!  Checked the temp sensor #1 cold (engine had not run 2-3
hours) and it checked 2000 ohms, so I guess that's not my problem. 
Checked the thermo switch connections, no problem.  Disconnected the
cold start switch injector, no change in the performance of the engine. 
The outside temp is 75ish but the engine is running EXTRA rich with lots
of smoke and wont stay running with my foot off the gas.  Looks like I'm
back to having a bad AFM!?  Any more guidance?
