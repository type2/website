Subject: Multiple sunroof postings/e-mail problems

Right now it is 1:20 EST Fri morning. let's see when this post gets on the list.
I guess most of you by now   :&lt;)   realize that there is almost a 24 hr delay
from the time I post to the list, and the time it shows up on the list. This
started happening wednesday.  Any ideas as to why???

Oh, and to all of you who kept e-mailing me to stop re-posting it - that was
futile.   
I had already stopped trying to re-post it 24 hrs before you even saw it, and
e-mailed me.
