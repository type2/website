So Frank Gover says:
&gt; ?  Could I buy a &quot;moderately beefed up 1600 DP&quot; a trans. and put it on the 72
&gt;  camper
&gt;    I mentioned??? Remember it does *NOT* have engine or trans. I can put the
&gt;  best
&gt; engine and trans. that $2,000 - $2700 can buy. What will this be????
&gt; 
&gt; ?  How much will this be???

It's not that much gain in power and I would rather keep that money in
reserve for other expenses on the bus.  Brakes, bearings, tires.  You
alone have to make the decision of what you want.  The '71 is much
cheaper and easier to work on than the '72.  Even with the bigger
engine.

&gt; 
&gt;    The intended use of this camper is to go sight-seeing with my wife without
&gt; having to worry about hotel reservations or where we'll spend the night. Also,
&gt; having a place to sleep in our weekend trips will make it more afordable and
&gt;  will
&gt; allow us to repeat it more often. I mentioned 6 adults because sometimes we go
&gt;  out
&gt; with 2 more couples to festivals, cities (120 miles radius) and we always have
&gt;  to
&gt; take 2 cars.

Where are you going to put 6 adult people in a camper?  There are at best 5 
seats in a camper that will have seatbelts.  If one or two don't mind sitting 
on the floor, you will be fine.  That's why I recommended the bus instead.
