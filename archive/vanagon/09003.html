So todds_at_sonny.chotel_dot_com says:
&gt; I apologize for taking up this much bandwidth - I guess I tend
&gt; to prattle on....Anyway, I live about 20 miles E. of Phoenix,
&gt; commute 60+ miles a day in the bus, and carry more spares
&gt; than is healthy!

Prattle on?  When Joel spews out a short blirb like this, I tend
to worry.   ;)

Your story about the '69 reminds me of my '68 that I miss.  It
was a great car.  :(

Cheers!
