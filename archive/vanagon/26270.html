                              Repairing Steel Brake Lines

When you put your foot on the brakes you generate up to twelve hundred pounds
of pressure in the brake lines.  Brake fluid is a mixture of oil and alcohol
capable of finding the smallest leak even when not under pressure.  To insure
against leaks, your brake system uses metal-to-metal fittings torqued to some
fairly high numbers.  The hydraulic lines are typically made of steel tubing.
 The steel tubing is flared; different forms of flare are used.

The brake lines on early VW's use what is called a 'bubble-flare' fitting.
 American cars use what is called a 'double-flare'.  Some Japanese cars use
double-flare fittings idential to American SAE fittings except for their
metric thread.  I don't know what late-model VW's use.

Replacement steel brake lines are stock repair items.  They come in American,
Japanese, and European style.  The 'metric-bubble-flare' is the stuff you
want for an early VW.  The replacement lines come in a variety of lengths
from about one foot up to six feet.  To make longer runs, you splice two
pieces together using fittings that have female threads on each end, usually
called connectors, barrel-nuts or sleeves.  When buying connectors make sure
they not only match the thread of the fitting but have the correct angle to
accept the type of flare your line uses.  Check everything for fit before you
leave the store.  A careless counterman can kill you.

The tool needed to make the bubble flare is expensive and difficult to find;
some FLAPS and even some brake shops will tell you bubble-flares are a
factory-made sort of thing, that no such tool is available.  If they try that
one on you it might be wise to take your business elsewhere since they
obviously don't know theirs.

American-style double-flare tools are fairly common and not too expensive if
you get them from J.C.Whitney or a dealer who specializes in automotive
tools.  I paid $48 for such a tool at a FLAPS in the Puget Sound area.  The
going rate is about half that when bought at a real tool store.

The availability of the double-flare tool, and of adaptors that allow
double-flare fittings to mate with bubble-flare fittings, is the key point of
this posting and one I apparently didn't make clear in my report on repairing
a damaged brake line in a 1967 bus.  One subscriber,  a well qualified
mechanic, pointed out that I could have accomplished the job using stock SAE
replacement line with just an adaptor on the end to mate with the Volkswagen
master cylinder.  While that would probably work with a wheel cylinder or
perhaps a bug master cylinder, it won't work with the '67 bus.  In 1967
Volkswagen introduced a dual-system master cylinder for the bus, with the
front section providing juice to the rear wheels.  Due to the master cylinder
being right alongside a frame member there isn't enough room to use an
adaptor and still make the required bend in the tubing, although it might
work for the front brake circuit.  

But his point is valid; there are probably a dozen other ways to accomplish
the same end.  The method I used, and the one described here, is a reflection
of my experience and the parts that were available.  If I were a little
smarter or if I had a bigger selection of parts, I might have done the job
another way.  In this case, the damage was at the bend, just beside the
master cylinder, where the brake line had been deliberately crimped,
apparently in an unsuccessful attempt to shut off the rear braking system.
 (There is a 'blind' fitting that will do this.  Most off-road racers carry
one for emergencies.) 

The effect the repair the procedure I used was to cut away the damaged
portion of the existing system and splice in a section of new, undamaged
tubing.  Since there was no bubble-flare tool available, I used a
double-flare tool to install a standard SAE fitting onto the existing brake
line, converting that to metric-bubble through the use of an adaptor,
attaching the replacement brake line to the adaptor.  It's a bit Heath
Robinson -- there are more elegant ways to do it -- but it works and isn't
too clumsy. 

Stock replacement steel brake lines are straight, you must bend them to match
whatever section you're replacing.  In the case above, the line needed a
sharp ninety-degree bend just behind the fitting (the end going into the
master cylinder) then a slow curve to carry the line over the arch of the
frame above the front torsion tubes.  Given the nature of steel tubing, it's
best to use a tubing bender.  Be sure it will accept 3/16&quot; tubing; don't
trust a 'one-size-fits-all' sort of bender.  I didn't have a bender but was
able to do the job using a box-end wrench as a bending tool.  (You slide the
tubing through the box-end, make your bends a little at a time as you 'walk'
the tubing through the box-end.  Practice on old tubing first, give your
hands a chance to learn how to do it.  If you crimp the line, throw it away
and start over.) 

Determining the needed length of the replacement line can be a problem since
you must include the length of the new fittings, adaptor and barrel nut.
 Under the vehicle, I traced the line back until I came to a relatively open
area where I thought there would be enough room for me to use the tubing
cutter and flaring tool.  I estimated the tubing run at two and a half feet
and kept that figure in mind when I went to the auto-parts store.  They had
stock metric bubble-to-bubble line 30 inches long and I bought it as the
first step in making up the replacement.  The next step was to find the
needed fittings.  With those in hand, I screwed them all together and screwed
the replacement tubing into them and measured the total length: 32-1/2&quot;  This
told me where to cut the existing brake line.

Back under the vehicle, I used a piece of string to measure the curving path
of the existing line.  Since you can't stretch steel tubing, give yourself a
little insurance by making the cut a bit closer to the fitting.  I measured
32-1/2&quot;, made the cut at 32&quot;, came within an eighth of an inch of a perfect
match despite all the curves.

To form a good flare the tubing must be cut square.  A tubing cutter is the
best way but if you're working in cramped quarters you'll probably need the
small style of cutter, the kind thats about one inch cubed.  Other methods of
cutting steel tubing are to score it all around with a Swiss file having a
sharp edge, break it on the score and file it square. Flushing the finished
line to get rid of metal partiles is a standard procedure.

If you've never used a double-flare tool, laying on your back under the
vehicle isn't the place to start.  Make a practice flare on the good end of
the tubing you've just cut away. A key step is getting the chamfer on the
inner diameter of the tubing just right, rather tricky given the small
diameter of brake lines.  I used a drill bit ground for drilling aluminum
(ie, a steeper angle than for steel).  A regular drill or chamfer tool will
work but will take more effort when forming the second flare.

The procedure for making a double-flare is the same as for making a single
flare except you use a special fixture in the flaring tool to first fold the
edge of the tubing inwards.  The object is to produce a flare having a
thickness of metal equal to the wall of the tubing.  A single flare produces
a tapered thickness and usually causes steel tubing to crack, if not during
fabrication, when the fitting is tightened down.

After fabricating your new line and closing the system, open the first
fitting downstream from the new fitting and pump about a cup of fluid through
the system to flush out any debris.  On the repair I made, the first
downstream fitting was the T-fitting to the rear wheels.

With all parts on hand, the repair took about three hours under adverse
condtions with a tired mechanic.  If someone is shooting at you it should
take only a few minutes :-)

Being able to stop is more important than being able to go.  Knowing how to
adjust your brakes is more important than knowing how to adjust your points.
 Being able to overhaul your brake system is far more important than knowing
how to overhaul your engine.

Shiny paint and clean upholstery is nice but it's a skin-deep sort of thing.
 If you spend all your time thinking of paint and polish one day your pretty
car will try to kill you. 

All of my cars are ugly but they'll stop on a dime and give you six cents
change.
