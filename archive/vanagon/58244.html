Skylight was $129, actuator $24. Yes, it's the mechanism for raising and
lowering the skylight. I believe the Bus Depot has lower prices for these
items plus many others on your list. Their web site is www.busdepot_dot_com, or
e-mail to list_at_busdepot_dot_com. Also, contact Sorin Bejenaru at
103164.3373_at_compuserve_dot_com for used items--he buys used Westies from
insurance companies and sells the pieces. I bought a couple of small items
from him and he was very reasonable and prompt.

&gt; Joseph,
&gt; 
&gt; I think I've got this right.  Forgive me if not.  I'm subscribed to 
&gt; the vanagon mailing list and noticed a post you made regarding 
&gt; skylights for vanagons.  I believe you bought one from Euro-American? 
&gt; I'm looking to replace the skylight on my 89' Westy and was wondering 
&gt; if you found E-A to have the lowest price.    
&gt; 
&gt; I've just started my search. I will be calling the local VW dealer 
&gt; soon, I figure they will be highest price.  Also, you mentioned 
&gt; &quot;actuator&quot; in your post.  Is this the mechanism that raises and 
&gt; lowers skylight?  While I've got you, can you offer any input into 
&gt; finding the following items I'm needing for same vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; Fridge vent cover
&gt; Mudflap for driver's side (protects propane tank)
&gt; VDO speedometer/odometer (round dash unit)
&gt; Rear bumper (black)
&gt; Bumper end cap (passenger side-black)
&gt; 
&gt; Any input much appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW I've got E-A's phone and fax number.Kelly Barthlow
