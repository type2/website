Subject: WanaCamperVan - Please Help !

Can anyone help me find a Vanagon Camper with no
rust and located within a 700 mile radius of Northwestern
Minnesota ?

Here's what I'm looking for;

1)  I'd like a Syncro but any Vanagon reasonably priced
     would interest me.
2)  Prefer a camper model without the sink and stove.
     Any other model with the rear bed would be considered.
3)  I don't care about the mechanical condition,
     but the body must be in excellent shape.
4)  I would consider anything that would make a good
     base for making my own personalized camper.
5)  I will consider a diesel since I have a VW factory turbo
     diesel engine I could put in it.
6)  Ideally I'd like to find a camper that needs an engine.

If you can help me out I'd appreciate it !  Please e-mail
anything that might lead me to a purchase.

Thanks in advance.
