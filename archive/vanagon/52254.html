Subject: Re: Eurovan Central Locking

I am not very familiar with EVs but your discription seems to be leading to
a switch in the drivers door that con trols the power door locks. A very
susceptible place for water.

&gt;Hello EV'ers:
&gt;
&gt;My 1995 EV-Winne has developed the irritating habit
&gt;of cycling its power door locks locked/unlocked
&gt;continually when the weather is wet.  This occurs when 
&gt;trying to operate the lock.  Once inside with the door
&gt;closed, the cycling stops.  I have to time
&gt;a pull on the door handle in order to get in!  When
&gt;the weather is dry, everything is normal.  Sometimes
&gt;the problem can be overcome by using the lock on the 
&gt;other door, but the problem is not restricted to one lock.
&gt;
&gt;Any similar experiences?  Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
