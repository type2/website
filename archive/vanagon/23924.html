Hi Martha,

Thanks for kicking my complacent butt into returning to the list.
Alice and I have been travelling for most of the summer (Eastern Canada and
Hawaii) so we had to unsubscribe before we left. I guess we probably should have
mentioned it to the group, but I was on a plane the same day that school ended
and I turned in  grades, keys etc. for the summer. Alice had left for a Biology
conference in Calgary a week earlier and we were to meet up in Toronto.
Unfortunately, we were not able to rent a VW camper while in Canada as we had
hoped, but we survived our travels in a rental bone-shaking Hyundai (and drove
all over New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, and Prince Edward Island) and
an old Subaru 4WD Wagon while on the Big Island of Hawaii. Of course we broke
down on the infamous &quot;saddle road&quot; half way between Hilo and Kona, miles from
nowhere, and later lost headlights while driving a dark back road from the
beach. We have both also had interruptions in our internet access. UCI has gone
security crazy and was reverifying all accounts so they disconnected us. Alice
has a new legitimate account (email to acgibb_at_uci_dot_edu) and I helped  her put
together a WWW home page (http://www-ee.bio.uci_dot_edu/usr/gibb/Alice.html) but
they got wise (five years late:) to the fact that I am no longer a student and
disconnected my vmsa account. I still have my gina account
(lmacphe_at_cello.gina_dot_calstate_dot_edu) and it's cheap but not very reliable. We got
back recently but have not had a chance to resubscribe, though I am about to do
just that. We've also taken the van to Sequoia for a backpacking trip (that's a
tale of van woes) and twice to the mechanic's for upgrades since returning. It's
been a fun but very busy summer.

-Larry

P.S. feel free to forward this to the list.
