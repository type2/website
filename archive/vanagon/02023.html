Welcome aboard Stuart!  Great mods you've done to your Ruby.  Better
be careful about announcing them too loudly to THIS group, or you'll
have people camping out in your driveway, beggin you to run H2) lines
from their sinks to the backs of their campers for rinsing off sandy
feet.  Can I be first in line??!?

If you've missed the material about our proposed &quot;Bricks Across
America&quot; group tour, and you're interested, let me know...
