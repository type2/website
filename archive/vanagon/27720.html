My '85 is dripping brake fluid from the clutch slave cylinder. I
thought I might just try replacing the seals. I tried doing this
several years ago on an old Datsun's brake slave cylinder but it leaked
soon afterward. Anyone have luck with the cheap approach or should I do
it right and just buy a new one.
