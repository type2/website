Subject: 1600 leak near oil cooler
Date: Thu, 30 May 1996 11:33:05 GMT


Looking for some advice on welding a small crack.

There is a small leak in an otherwise good block just under the
oil cooler. You know where the two oil holes are that feed the cooler.
The front (FRONT is FRONT) one is very close to the outside (left) wall.
A small crack there is leaking oil. 

Can it be welded successfully?
