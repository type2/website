Hi all.  I used to read this list a lot, but haven't been around recently.
I've got an old '64 MicroBus to unload.  I got in hopes of restoration, but
it just isn't going to happen anytime soon.  If anyone can make an offer 
($300/obo), please e-mail me directly.

Sorry if this is to selling oriented.

thanks, 

Ben
