Subject: ...Seattle...alternator...help them!!!


Hey now, buslist...
  Just got off the phone. Karen's bus just broke down in Tacoma \ WA. She
needs an alternator and voltage regulator for her 77 bus. The guy at the
gasstation quoted her 390.- and she can't afford that. Can anyone help her ?
Where in the Seattle\Tacoma area can one get a rebuilt one ? They have tools
and can put it in themselves. Any Seattlelites with ideas ? I'm stuck here
in Oregon and can only watch...
  Can you help ???
