Subject: Alternative alternators?

I've an '83 diesel Westie into which a new audio system will soon be 
installed.  My new technical advisor for this formerly owned an auto 
audio shop and won some Florida audio championship for three years with 
his promotional van that was featured in several magazines.  Even for a 
modest high accuracy system, he insists the Westie must have at least a 
65 amp alternator.  I installed an inverter, and for recharging a second 
battery, I wanted to increase charging capacity anyway.
  So what applicable more powerful alternators are available?  I suspect 
a few gaser owners would also like to know what alternatives fit their 
Vanagons or EVs.

  I'm not committed to going forward with his plans yet, but I have 
agreed to pay for a system design.  If and only if there's interest in 
the key elements he specifies, I'll post that information on the list.  
I've been told installation/design is at least as important in 
determining final sound as component selection.  
  Thanks ahead for any good alternator upgrade leads.

   John Wakefield
