Looks like Dave saw my post on chains at skip's place. He likes the cable
chains sometimes and I have to admit he has a point. 

The reason I hate mine is that the cable chains come off and can't handle
the punishment during a tough day of traversing a muddy, bolder strewn
trail. But for plain, deep snow I guess I like my cable chains just fine.

As for the vibration, I find that the vibration of the cable chains on
pavement is intolerable so I can't imagine how it could be any worse with
the standard chains with extra V-var welded on. I'm looking forward to
experiencing this.

&gt;Derek,
&gt;
&gt;I have both types of chains, cable and the heavy duty ones with the extra V-bar
&gt;welded on the cross-links. I use them both, depending on conditions. The heavy
&gt;duty ones give great grip and are very durable but cause unbearable vibration
&gt;if you have to traverse any pavement. Only use these things on pavement if you
&gt;have some fillings you'd like to replace! The cables on the other hand are
&gt;light duty, flimsy and don't give great grip. But they don't vibrate a lot
&gt;either. In the Sierra Nevada in winter there will frequently be chains required
&gt;on roads that are only snowy/icy in the shady parts with a lot of exposed
&gt;pavement where the sun is shining. Cables are ideal for these type of
&gt;conditions. 
&gt;
&gt;I've also been in circumstances where I've run both sets at the same time -
&gt;cables on the front, chains on the rear (we're talking 2wd here). These are
&gt;situations where the amount of snow on the roads is so high that even 4wd
&gt;requires chains. My snow driving experience is that getting turned and stopped
&gt;is often more difficult (and more important) than getting the bus moving. Using
&gt;the cables on the front is very effective towards this end without causing the
&gt;onset of carpal tunnel syndrome from steering wheel shaking.
