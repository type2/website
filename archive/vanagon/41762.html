&gt; 1968-69     Pearl White
&gt; 1970-71     Pearl White
&gt;             Titian Red
&gt; 1972        Pearl White

I think it would be save to add that light blue color (whatever it's 
called) to the list for '71's, since that's what my van's original color 
was. I'm certain it's an original Westy, but I can check further for 
verification if anyone wants me to. Please don't tell me I have the one 
rare light blue westy for which there's been a $20,000 bounty for years; 
I just painted her a different color. =0 Joe
