&lt;&lt; Can anyone explain or send a picture on how to correctly install the
 middle seat on the 2 sliding rails?
  &gt;&gt;

remove the corkboard, set the seat on the floor, and slide it in! (the
runners on the seat are inserted into the tracks on the floor)

then re-install the little bolts to keep the seat snugly in place.
