&gt;Two things will keep me from considering this one (or other CLs). From =
the=20
&gt;original VW EV brochure sent out with the video, two of the main=20
&gt;differences between the CL and GL were the demisting vents for the side=20
&gt;windows in front of the mirrors are absent on the CL, and would be very=20
&gt;nice in perpetually damp Seattle, ...

You could make do possible with the A/C vent -- aim it
towards the windows when needed.  I personally don't find
much comes out of the window vents.

&gt;and very important for a road trip van,=20
&gt;the lack of either a factory OR aftermarket cruise control. I might be =
able=20
&gt;to live without the demisting but cruise control is a necessity. Has =
anyone=20
&gt;out there ever done this for their CL?

Many GL's don't have this, either.  I had an aftermarket one
put on after I bought my used 93 EV GL.  I had hoped the
dealer could find a leftover cruise kit from when the EV's
were being imported, but after they inquired, I was told the
only CC's came from the factory.

I went down to a local aftermarket installer.  Their
installer had enough experience to fit the CC from
components, rather than from specific model kits.
