&gt; Ralf et al - I second this notion.  I'm in the middle of CA,
&gt; and if this plan is in fact decided up, I volunteer my
&gt; driveway as a starting point for this adventure!  And, yes
&gt; you can all park your cars here.  I suppose you can even
&gt; have free computer access  :)

Awww... I was gonna volunteer to start cause the concensus seems to be
to go north through California, and I am about as far south as you can
get (San Diego)!  I suppose I should hold off until I get done sorting
out locations, though (and that may take a while!).

Also, someone suggested May 1995 as a good time, and I agree (or maybe
April and May) because it will not be so hot and the scenery would
be even better with everything blooming, but as Martha mentioned some
people are probably on academic schedules.  To help find the fairest
solution, could the following two groups of people e-mail me:

1.  Those who would not be able to participate in a trip of any kind
	before mid-June (or thereabouts).

2.  Those who are *strongly* in favor of a Springtime trip.

I think I already know how this one will turn out, but I'd like
to make sure.  Please e-mail me privately at &quot;schwarze_at_nosc_dot_mil&quot;
and I will tally the results and let you all know...
