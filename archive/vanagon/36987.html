Subject: VW stuff

Hey all,
While I was parts shopping at the local FL(foreign)APS today I asked the counter
guy if they carried the big chrome VW logo that goes on the front of the bus.
The guy said &quot;you're not gonna want it when I tell you.&quot;  It was
$78(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  I told him he was right.  Well, when i receive my WCM and
RMMW catalogs I will see if they carry them, but if anyone has a spare one (yeah
right) that will fit a '78 bus, let me know and maybe we can work out something.

Today at the FL(regular)APS I ran into a guy with an '82 Vanagon, so we chatted
for a while.  I asked him if his was still air-cooled (I assumed it was a gas
engine) and he informed me that it was Diesel.  Then his son said, &quot;Yeah, I
think we hit 40 once.&quot;

:)

Sean
