Subject: Front heat problem '85 


Does anybody have a clues as to why my front heater fan doesn't work 
right? It will occasionally go on a few minutes into a drive and then 10 
minutes later it will start to &quot;die&quot;. It will start to slow down, and in 
a few minutes it will quit. It won't start up again until it feels like 
it. Usually a few days later Same thing every time. I think my parent's 
checked it out at the dealer once and the dealer said that we needed a 
new ($$$$) fan. Too much money.

It seems more like the problem would be electrical. I tried a new switch, 
but the same thing would happen.

Any Ideas?
