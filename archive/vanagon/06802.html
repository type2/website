Subject: Frog joke &lt;offensive to computer programmers&gt;

A computer programmer happens across a frog in the road. The frog pipes up,
&quot;I'm
really a beautiful princess and if you kiss me, I'll  stay with you for a
week&quot;.
The programmer shrugs his shoulders and puts the frog in his pocket.

A few minutes later, the frog says &quot;OK, OK, if you kiss me, I'll give you
great
sex for a week&quot;.  The programmer nods and puts the frog back in his pocket.

A few minutes later, &quot;Turn me back into a princess and I'll give you great
sex
for a whole year!&quot;.  The programmer smiles and walks on.

Finally, the frog says, &quot;What's wrong with you?  I've promised you great sex
for
a year from a beautiful princess and you won't even kiss a frog?&quot;

&quot;I'm a programmer,&quot; he replies.  &quot;I don't have time for sex....but a talking
frog is pretty neat.&quot;
