&lt;&lt; the binding is not normal...it is different than the normal binding on a
 tight turn....it kicks in sooner and seems tighter ... and first
 appeared after driving at highway speeds for long distance when it was
 hot out
  i think Jim Davis offers me the best hope because he seems to know what
 i am talking about and his cure makes sense....i'm going to replcae the
 tires and change the differential fluid to slippery synthetic....and
 i'll report back in about a month....  &gt;&gt;

Although it might turn out to be good advice, it wasn't mine.  I don't want
to take the credit from whomever it is due.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
