Subject: Bus Boys Catalogs &amp; Other Poison Pen Letters

Hi Jim -

I would like to extend my appreciation for forwarding these letters of
complaint and will promptly look into each and everyone of these this weekend
(May 4-5).  Over 45,000 catalogs were mailed last year and I realize that
some of them didn't make it to their target for one reason or another.  One
bad problem I had was with the printer that was supposed to mail them direct
for us and they did an absolutely ROTTEN job.  Another big glitch was the
computer database used for the mailing becoming corrupted and I have been
spending the last 4 months reconstructing names, addresses, invoices,
requests, etc..
Y'know, a lot of the &quot;volks&quot; out there do not realize that Bus Boys is a 2
man show - myself and Bill (Charles got tired of the cold winters and went
back to Southern Cal.) who work over 12 hours a day at the office and I spend
another 4 hours at home replying to E-Mail requests, quotations and doing the
general paperwork.  I have another 2 people in the manufacturing shop bustin'
their butts 6 days a week too.  While we're not perfect, we do the best we
can with what we've got - and with the excellent business we've been having
for the past two years, it's been an unqualified success.  But it can be
improved and it will be improved.
Send your Poison Pen Letters :) To:  Jim at BusBoys_at_aol_dot_com
