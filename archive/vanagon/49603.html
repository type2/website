Subject: Lost all mail since 2pm tues

Hi, _at_#$%*&amp;?!  compuserve was upgrading (finally) to their new e-mail system
yesterday, and I was unable to get/send any e-mail since 2pm on tues. So
consequently, I lost all e-mail after 2pm since I couldn't acess my mailbox.
Here's a dumb question, how do I go about obtaining that lost mail?, the
archives? How many of you have a mailbox capacity greater than 100 incoming
messages?
anybody who sent me any messages, try again since I did not get them.

any help would be appreciated.
