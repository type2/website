Subject: report of recon. trip


Yesterday we went up and checked out the Oakland Feather River CAmp, near
Quincy.  En route we picked up Gail Fitzpatrick and her friend near
Sacramento.  It turned out to be quite a significant lengthed trip -
about 500 miles RT from the bay area, but was definitely work a look see.
The places is chock full of amenities, but a bit run down.  However, it's
so large, and the places which I think would interest us the most are
not run down, but rather right near a large fire pit with seating ring, etc.
The place is very rustic, and in quite a lovely area of the state,
northwest of Tahoe, but much away from tourists and crowds.  

AT any rate, many of the months seemed undesirable, due to weather
slated to be hot, summer rush of regulars coming there, bugs, place
not being cleaned up yet, etc.  We decided, although cold, that October
would probably be the optimum month to visit, with the added advantage
of probably being able to see some beautiful fall foliage en route.

So, I suggest we put this place down for October.  We have Ron's dibs
on Ventana wilderness for July.

Malcolm Holser's idea of a place up near Mariposa sounds great to me,
especially if he wasn't teasing about plane rides.  :)  So I nominate
that the Mariposa location should be next.  How about setting a date?

Do we want April still, or May?  Please speak out, so we can get the
ball rolling on this.
