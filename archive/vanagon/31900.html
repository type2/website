Subject: Flaky fuel gauge

Hello all!
My '75 Westy has a sick fuel gauge - it never registers more than 1/2 a tank
and I can bottom out on &quot;reserve&quot;and still have half a tank left... obviously
this makes for high tension on any lengthy road trips!  Also, I can watch the
needle fluctuate from 1/2 to 1/4 to &quot;R&quot; and back - it doesn't matter whether
I'm on level ground, uphill, downhill, accelerating or decelerating - that
needle jumps all over da place!  Now I suppose that it's the float thingy
inside the gas tank which is to blame, but I'm posting this in the hope that
there's a way to determine what the problem is *without* dropping the engine
to remove the tank for inspection/cleaning/whatever... 

Any ideas out there?  Or must I remain  &quot;Have gas can, Will travel&quot;?
