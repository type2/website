Subject: need vanagon westy table leg [f]

So Martha says:
&gt; 
&gt; I thought I had a lead a few weeks ago on acquiring a vanagon westy table
&gt; leg.  Unfortunately, the person couldn't locate it, and I've still been
&gt; unable to find one in a junkyard.  I'm in need of the pipe-pole, and hopefully,
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Have you tried an adult book store?  :O  ;)

&gt; the thing it fits in to, on the under side of the table.  I already have
&gt; the thing it fits into which is attached to the camper.  I'
&gt; am interested in either leg, front or back, and the height doesn't much matter.

Now Martha, just what are you REALLY after!!!?  :p
