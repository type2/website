&gt; i'm not sure, but i think it has something to do with the &quot;rear&quot; being the
&gt; steering wheels (when you have it in reverse). i've noticed this with
&gt; forklifts and front-end-loaders. you have to be really careful steering them
&gt; especially with a load.


I've also noticed this especially on a locally made three wheel recumbent
bicycle, (trike). The front wheel is driven and the two rear wheels, which
are just slightly behind your butt, steer. In order to reduce this
&quot;magnification&quot; effect, the makers went to great lengths installing
variable rate steering (less steering effect the more you increase the
turn) aswell as installing steering dampners. Its still not a great
solution but without these modifications you tended to overcontrol and
&quot;snake&quot; your way along.
