&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I have the following problem. Sometimes, I the motor has ignition failures, 
&gt;especially with low rpm. Two of the ignition cables were quite loose, so I 
&gt;replaced them. But nothing changed.
&gt;
&gt;So, what is the problem now. I also noticed that the contact of the 
&gt;distributor arm is a bit &quot;charred&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions are appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;T.S.

&gt;
&gt;P.S. Can you remove the distributor head from the screening plate or do you 
&gt;have to change them both as one unit?
&gt;
&gt;
Similar thing happened on my 78 Scirocco couple of months back...turned
out the distributor shaft was wobbling (now there's a technical term)
as it rotated, sometimes gouging the contacts in the cap and sometimes
not giving a sparc at all.  Not bad service...17 years and 165K miles
on the original distributor, but a new one took care of that problem.
