&gt; The only dealer on Southern Vancouver Island now is Speedway Motors.  My
&gt; experience with them is bitter.  I believe I can say this because I have
&gt; bought 3 out of 5 new VW's from them and persuaded 6 other friends to buy
&gt; new VW's and all bought them from Speedway (and yes, they're all still
&gt; friends...no thanks to Speedway).
&gt; 
&gt; Service:  expect to go back 2-3 times to get the problem fixed 85% of the
&gt; time.   If you get the right Service manager and then the right mechanics
&gt; you can get away first crack lucky.  I have a history of idiotic mistakes
&gt; that they've made on my vehicles that have induced other problems.  There
&gt; is not one, repeat one person I know that has thought beyond satisfactory
&gt; for this dealership in service.
&gt; 
&gt; Sales:  I recently took a GM-Type friend in to test-drive a Jetta GLX
&gt; (VR6).  Well, he didn't even get to drive it until I told the salesman that
&gt; I was incredibally put-out by his attitude.  He drove the thing for 15
&gt; minutes and then let my friend take the wheel for the last 5 (after major
&gt; complaining) in heavy traffic...GREAT!  his excuse was that my friend's
&gt; wife wasn't with him even though this was to be  his business vehicle,
&gt; leased for business and his wife had the Buick and couldn't drive standard!
&gt; Anyhow, my friend liked the car but will not buy from them if he considers
&gt; a VW now.  He went and took out a Sunfire and was treated like royalty.
&gt; 
&gt; Poor attitude, poor service, inflated egos and prices.  I don't know where
&gt; I'll buy my next new VW from.  Maybe I'll keep buying used from other
&gt; dealers...like the Honda dealer I bought my Westy from!  Bruce
