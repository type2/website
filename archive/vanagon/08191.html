&gt; Got off of the freeway, was driving about 65 for around 15 miles.  
&gt; Stopped for red light at end of off ramp (Jimmy Carter Blvd. for you 
&gt; grits fans) and as the engine starts to idle, the oil LED begins to 
&gt; flicker.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked the oil, it's level, we aren't overheating.  I continue on my 
&gt; way, driving the surface streets to my office.  Never happens again.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I did just change the oil, for the first time after acquiring the 
&gt; beast.  I'm running Mobil 1 5W-30.  What do you think?  Am I looking at 
&gt; impending doom here?  Volkswagen used to say, back in the middle '70s 
&gt; anyway, that this was normal and I've never believed it.--

My manually-informed guess is that 5W30 is way too low for your climate
AND your engine type. For the aircooled engines 10W30 is not recommended
until temperatures are consistently below 10 C (about 50 F). Unless these
temps are what you are getting you are better off running 5W50 Mobil1. I
have been using 10W30 synthetic in the 82 and oil pressure does drop off
a bit when temps hover around 50, try mixing in some higher weight oil if
necessary (rather than changing all of it) even dino oil can be added if
necessary. Check the manual first......DC --
