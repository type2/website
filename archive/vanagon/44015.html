Subject: Re: '76 Westy Water Tank Capacity?

Arnold Schultz writes:

&gt;My book says 12 gallons (imperial), 56 litres, 14.5 gallons (US) and
&gt;5 Gallons reserve. This would be for 1970 to 1979 type 2's

I believe (as the subject indicates) that Mike Wagner wanted to know the
capacity of the WATER Tank, which is 7 gallons (26 liters) from page 10 of
the 76, 77, 78 &amp; 79 Campmobile Owner's Manuals.

The figure you give is for the FUEL tank from page 66 of the '76 Type 2
Owner's Manual.
