Subject: Re: 6V - 12V

&gt;
&gt;Hi
&gt;
&gt;I get the digest, so sorry, no quotes. You heard it all before anyway :)
&gt;
&gt;A while ago, Thom asked r.e. 6V - 12V. Yes it is possible, and I would 
&gt;not recommend going 6V -&gt; 110V AC -&gt; 12V. Much too inefficient. I have a 
&gt;circuit somewhere that converts 12V -&gt; 24V. Something similar should 
&gt;work. But the best solution, methinks, is to use a switchmode PSU based 
&gt;on a Linear Technologies LT1070(?) requlator. This should give you 12V at 
&gt;about 1.5A from 6V _at_ 3A. I'll check using SwitcherCad, a program from LT 
&gt;do design these things.
&gt;
Yea but who cares- 1.5 amps is just a trickle compared to 5.5 amps thats 
required for the fridge.   You'd have to put 4 of them in parralell just to 
get the amperage.  So that drains around 12 amps at 6 volts.  This is 
unrealistic as well, there are no 100% efficient machines out there.
