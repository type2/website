&gt; I have been following your Bus talk on the list.  I am in a similar position
&gt; as you.  I just recently purchased a '56 7-door panel Bus... all bone stock.

7 door panel?  I'm confused...  

&gt; As I am sort of moving right now I haven't been able to spend a lot of time

Bummer - but you should be using the BUS to move :)

&gt; But the issue really comes down to drivability.  In my case the bus has the
&gt; original style '56 36HP engine and split-case transaxle.  To say that the
&gt; vehicle is slow would be a flagrant understatement.  In today's city/freeway
&gt; driving environment the old stock splitties are completely underpowered.

I updated both the engine and trans in mine.   I used this adapter thinging
I got from bus boys to put in a tunnel case transmission.  If I ever wanna
go back, I take the old tranny out (adapter goes on the tranny, as  I remember)
and put the tunnel case back in and a 36 hp motor.  I didn't have to make
any mods to the bus to do the swap.
