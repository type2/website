I would think that your bell housing would warp (or crack).
This would cause the thrust plate to push only against the bottom of
your flywheel and I bet that the bearings wouldn't hold up long.

Is the top of the bell housing flush against the block?

If you've been driving a lot with out the bell housing aligned, I wonder
what your tranny input shaft looks like.

I'd also think you might shatter your clutch because one side would
take all of the strain of accelleration.
