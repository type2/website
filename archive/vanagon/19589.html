races?

They weren't VWs, but I seem to remember that when the workers finished 
grading the brand new Ontario Motor Speedway (in southern California, now 
defunct (the racetrack, not SoCal (too bad (help!  I've been doing too much 
LISP!)))) they took the earthmoving machinery and had races around the 
not-yet-paved track.  Imagine, the big grader is dicing with the D-7 on the 
back straight at an amazing 3 mph, when the driver of the grader steps out for 
a cup of coffee and is back before they reach turn 3....
