Subject:      Fridge modification

In the VW manual there is a procedure to modify the air pump in the fridge by
drilling out the pump outlet and adding a check valve.

Is this a worthwhile thing to do while I have the fridge out of the van?

Also, is there a clever way to check the 12v heater with the fridge out of
the van?

Thanks
