&gt;There were no police reports for my wreck.  I just filed a claim to my company.


I was T-boned by an uninsured driver shotly after buying my panel.  Claim
went through by my rider ($7) for 'uninsured drivers' whew, cost $3200 to
fix.  Moved 250 miles, stayed 3 years, then moved 700 more miles away to
here and went for new insurance.
  &quot;Have you ever had a major accident?&quot; Nope said I. &quot;What about this one
I'm showing with the uninsured driver?&quot;  I didn't have that accident, they
did! said I. While wondering how the hell they found that.  Insurance Bureau
of Canada maintains a database, instant searchs on-line while you apply.
