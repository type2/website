To All:

The engine on the cover of Tom Wilson's book &quot;How to Rebuild Your Aircooled
Volkswagen Engine&quot; is build on a late-model Univeral Replacement Crankcase
(no serial number).

The opening into the lower right corner of the sump is the dip-stick/oil
filler opening that makes the case useable in Type III's.  The three holes
located at the 9 o'clock, 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions around the oil
pump cover are threaded for the rear cross-member used in some of the Type
II's.  The thumb-sized hole in the front flange to the lower-left from the
right-hand upper mounting bolt is for the timing sensor used on some fuel
injection systems.

There are a host of other differences, mostly minor, between a Universal case
and some others -- early stock FI cases did not have the drilling nor studs
for mounting a mechanical fuel pump, and the oil cooler/adaptor and oil pump
studs are smaller on early engines, but within those minor exceptions, all of
the Type I, II and III engines are interchangeable, either with the use of
adaptors or after minor machining.

There have been reports of ALUMINUM Type I universal cases turning up from
time to time.  If true, they will continue to turn up since they should last
just about forever.  All Type I, II and III cases were cast of a
high-strength magnesium alloy that hardens and cracks after experiencing x
number of heat cycles.  The Type IV engine uses an aluminum alloy that does
not have this unfortunate tendency.

After the Wall came down I heard a rumor of a huge pile of CAST IRON 36hp VW
crankcases outside an iron foundry in Rumania. No confirmation.  But knowing
the Russian penchant of never thowing anything away -- they are reputed to
have acres of WWII German hardware still parked here and there... right along
side of Napoleon's cannons --- it's possible that someone came up with a
bright idea to keep all those thousands of caputred Kubalvagens running,
using plentiful cast iron instead of the more expensive magnesium.
