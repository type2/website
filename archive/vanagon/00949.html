Joseph,
Of course you are absolutely right that a VW van is the ticket for
vacationing!  Generally, though I have a '71, I recommend a post '71
model because the engines have more displacement/power.  Also, the
price of parts has gone up steadily in the last couple of years, while
availability has gone down locally.  You must be a true VW survivalist
if you want to go with the vintage models.  IF you are mechanically
inclined, there's nothing like the satisfaction of driving your own
hand-crafted vehicle. If not, make sure you test the compression and
inspect for rust/corrosion at the very least, before you take the plunge.
