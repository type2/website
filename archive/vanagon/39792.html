&gt; I put the 81 camper on the road just for an hour at 55 to 65 mph in cool damp
&gt; weather and reasonably level terrain. After 15 minutes the temperature
&gt; settled in just slightly under 250 and the pressure about 20. When we exited
&gt; for the two lane the idiot light would come on as the pressure dipped below
&gt; 10 at each stop. Put it in neutral with a blip to the gas and the light would
&gt; go out. Driving slower didn't have any discernible effect on the temp. It was
&gt; as though it had built up heat and just couldn't shed it.

One thing to check is that your oil pressure gauge is getting full
voltage.  Mine goes down 8 psi when I turn on the headlights.  One of
these days I'm gonna install a monster cable from the battery to the
dash.  If your oil pressure is above 25psi, you probably don't have to
worry.  From what I understand, there is a pressure relief valve that
vents pressure in excess of 28 psi near the crank journals.  20, if your
gauge is accurate, is indicative (sp?) of a problem.  Is your timing set
correctly?  Correct heat range spark plugs?  Thermostat operating
correctly?  What kind of oil filter are you using?  I have noticed that
different brands of filters affect indicated oil pressure.  I don't
think you should be using a FRAM filter, as they lack some sort of
bypass valve that is required by your engine.  If you do nothing else,
set your idle up a little bit so that you have some oil pressure at
stoplights.  20 psi combined with 250 degree oil temperature is
definately running too hot.  One more thing you can do:  Check your
compression, especially if you don't know the history of your engine.
You're not only looking for low compression, but HIGH compression as
well.  If it's over 120 in any cylinder it's possible you have a high-
compression engine, or that there is a ton of carbon built up on top of
the piston.  This could well cause you to overheat.  I'm a believer in
low compression air-cooled VW engines, even though I don't know what my
compression is cause I didn't cc my heads (&lt;--Deliberate attempt to get
Bob Hoover's goat  :-))
