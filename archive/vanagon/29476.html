You've probably already seen the Robotman that talks about this.

Frame 1:
     Roommate:  Uh-uh.  Go away.  I'm cooking the turkey this Thanksgiving.
                Last Thanksgiving you totally botched it up.
     Robotman:  Here.  At least use a meat thermometer.

Frame 2:
     A closeup of the thermometer face, showing three areas on the dial:
        o   Oozing with salmonella
        o   Don't kid yourself -- salmonella's still alive and kicking
        o   Burnt to a crisp, but may still have salmonella --
            you never know

Frame 3:
     Roommate:  Where'd you get this thing?
     Robotman:  Item 25b, the Neurotic Gourmet catalog.

Peace,
Coyote (who's vegetarian :-)
