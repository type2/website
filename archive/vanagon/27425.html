&gt; Recently I journeyed to Kansas City to pick up the 84 Vanagon I'd

&gt; price that I negotiated for a Van with no dents and a deluxe interior
(snip)
&gt; At any rate, a fellow listserve member - Jon Christensen - agreed 
&gt; to install an engine in the Vanagon, as the original motor was 
&gt; partially siezed.  I sent down the old engine out of my '84 Vanagon

**Very** glad to hear you and the Viking Ed. made it back to Fairbanks 
alright!!  8-)   Often times there just is no substitute for a good, 
professional mechanic, especially out on the road crossing the continent!
I'm glad that the journey went smoother then the Bob Hoover &amp; Grendel 
adventure.  Being a Wasserboxer novice, the experience for me was 
somewhat enlightening, but there was an underlying neurosis:
 &quot;My God, Fred will be driving this to Alaska--Don't $crew anything Up!!&quot;

At any rate, it's great to see you're both back at home.  Will you get 
the AC re-installed for the Fairbanks winter??  8-)
