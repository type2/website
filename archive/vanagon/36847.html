Subject: Vanagon badges

I'm getting the 81 Westy ready to drive off to the paint shop this weekend
and had one simple question. Can the VW and Vanagon badges on the rear door
(hatch) be safely pried off or do they need to be addressed by removing the
interior panel ?

Maybe two questions-I'm also replacing the pop top seal. Any reason not to go
with Busboy's version for around $100.

OK a third-I need the left side plastic warm air connector to the heater box.
Anybody have one or know who to call?

Thanks,

Weston
