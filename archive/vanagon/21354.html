Have you folks being seeing the previews of the forthcoming VW MPV,
the Sharan? However, the news I saw today from Geneva says that &quot;VW
has placed a two-year moratorium on the introduction of further niche
products...&quot;

I guess that means a camper may be a while in coming.

&quot;The new Sharan will initially be offered with VW's 1.9-litre
turbodiesel motor, but will be joined later by a further development 
of this engine giving higher power and more economy.&quot;

Marketing manager Friedrich-Wilhelm Klitzke remarked &quot;We are already
setting the pace with a return of more than 57mpg at a steady 56mph
from the standard unit. But we think that modifications to the 
injectors and management system will increase performance.&quot;

I do not know if the Sharan will be available, either soon or at all,
in the American market.
