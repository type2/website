We've got OE Shocks for the front of your Syncro at certainly a much better
price than the dealer's (a whopping $277.50 EACH!).  How about $49.95 each?
 Even better mention you're a V_at_L member and get 'em at $44.96 each.  Only
difference is that we don't supply 'em in a pretty VW/Audi Box - we buy 'em
in bulk.

Not a gimmick, we just keep probing out there for importing agents willing to
bring 'em in at an affordable price.  Up until late last year the major
importing warehouses were charging us almost $80 each (our cost).

Important Note:  Unfortunately, none of the Big Shock Names (KYB, Monroe,
Gabriel, KONI, etc.) offer an aftermarket shock at this time.  They claim not
enough 'em to justify tooling up for 'em.  It's a shame :-(  .
