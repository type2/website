Subject: this weekend


Ok, folx, a decision has to be made here.  I didn't get much if any
response from my previous posting about this weekend, so I'm assuming
there's not a lot of interest in an overnite campout Sat. nite.


Shall we all just meet at the San Jose gathering this sunday?  Time?
Place?  And when/where shall we show the videos?
