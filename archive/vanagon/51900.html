Subject: Re: Vanagon rear suspension

        For the problem of sagging rear coil springs causing increasing
negative camber, resulting in excessive tread wear on the insides of
the rear tires, has anyone done or toyed with the idea of putting shims
on the rear axle where that four bolt flange bolts onto the trailing arm?
(Shooting for longest run on sentence..........: )
        Then one could just increase the shim thickness as the coils sagged
more with age.
