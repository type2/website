Subject: found &quot;My&quot; camper

I finally found a camper for sale that looks half decent.  It is a 75,
was rebuilt 12k ago and changed to carburetion.  Top looks v. good
and body is decent.  Only asking $1800.  They are getting it 
inspected on Mon., and I could have it soon after.  If the inspection turns 
out well, I'll take my 79 bus in for inspection, and then sell it 
for about $1800.  We'll see how it goes!
