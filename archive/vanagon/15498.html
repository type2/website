Subject: Re: CHECK FUEL LINES NOW!!!!!!!!!!

That was close...these mechanics I know swear by real German gas line, with
the reinforced webbing. Make sure it's not Brazilian. Maybe next time the bug
has a gallon or two in it remove the fuel line, let it fill a portable tank,
and replace everything with real German line, which you can only get from a
VW place. They throw the other shit away. good luck :-)
