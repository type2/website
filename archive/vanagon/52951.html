Subject: 

I have an 85 Vanagon GL and here's my question:
What's the maximum highway speed I can cruise at without jeapordizing
my engine? I live in Utah and the freeways out here now have 75mph
limits. I'd like to travel at 75 but I worry about the rpms hovering over
4000 for extended periods of time. Should I worry?
