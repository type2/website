FYI,

I just ordered a rear heater core from Camelback VW for $117.00 plus three
day shipping (next weekend project).  My local dealer was 159.00 plus tax.

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;         I called the &quot;VW dealer&quot; here in Traverse City, MI to check on
the
&gt; cost of a rear heater core for my '86.
&gt;         When the parts guy got back to me he first apologized, I knew
that
&gt; this was going to be bad news. Over $800!! We discussed the part, and we
&gt; agreed that that was what I wanted. It was NOT the whole box, just the
&gt; heater core.
&gt;         Wow.
&gt;         
&gt;         Rob
