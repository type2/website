&gt; &gt; According to Muir, my type I 1966 engine (the ID # starts with an F) should be
&gt; &gt; timed to 7.5 degrees BTDC. The problem is, in the table that shows where each
&gt; &gt; year is to be timed, it shows mine as having three timing marks (TDC, 7.5BTDC,
&gt; &gt; 10BTDC) but my pulley only has two marks. What do these stand for? TDC and
&gt; &gt; 7.5BTDC? Which one should I time to?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; It has always been my experience that in these modern times the timing
&gt; marks don't mean much.  As usual - gas quality, compression ratio (if
&gt; engine has been rebuilt) type of distributer, altitude, etc. - All
&gt; effect how far one can safetly advance the timing.  My tried and true
&gt; method is to set it _at_ TDC with a static light so she'll run and after
&gt; making sure all other tune up items (carb, points etc.) are 100%, then
&gt; do the pull test.  With engine fully warm find a good hill and run her
&gt; hard up it full throttle and listen for the ping. Carefully advance the
&gt; timing until you hear the ping then retard it just a tad. Bingo - set.
&gt; Carry a 10 mm around with you so you can make the test enroute a few
&gt; times. Be sure you have it right before a long trip fully loaded on a
&gt; hot day.  Big packed loads are nice - sometimes you can't hear the
&gt; engine but this is bad if its pinging.  Pinging will kill the motor in
&gt; no time so listen for it. good luck.  
Anybody agree?? - Disagree??....
