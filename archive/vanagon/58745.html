Subject: Tachometer question

Ok, This may be pretty simple but I can't figure out how to connect a
tachometer to the engine in my 86 vanagon to get an rpm reading.  I first
tried the tach's instructions that came withit then, I tried hooking up
resistors to it as it is metioned in the bently manual for the air cooled
models, with no success. Can someone help me out.   thanks 
              
                                            chris
