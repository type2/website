&gt;In light of the fact that owning a VW bus NECESSARILY pigeon-holes me
&gt;as a Grateful Dead transient, I was considering a plate that reads
&gt;DEADLESS
&gt;I think the band is great but I don't want to be normalized as a function
&gt;of my wheels!

I write:  

By using a plate &quot;DEADLESS&quot; you are including yourself in
many conversations, whether you paricipate or not, about the
Grateful Dead.  For example, your parked and young deadhead
approaches your van, &quot;Hey brother, ... DEADLESS huh, how long 
since your last show.  I know what it's like being without a show,
I feel for you man.&quot;  Something like that is just the spit on a wave.
Your imagination can come up with dozens of examples, and many minutes
spent reassuring dead fans that you like the  music but would rather
not spend the rest of your life discussing the band.
        I personally have not a single dead sticker or inuendo
concerning the dead on my bus.  I keep it clean, I keep me clean,
most deadheads probably think I'm a narc!  That is my plan, no
stickers, short hair cut, will travel.  Despite my attempts
to elude the heads my wife and I attend a half dozen shows a year
on average.
        Here you go, stuck in a DEADLESS conversation about your
dead plate.  See ya, dave
