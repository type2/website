Oh yeah, don't stick your finger or anything else in that silver socket as
it has a constant 12 volt source. Someone on the list actually did stick
something in there, I think they are still alive though....DC

On the pulley mark, your are not alone, marking the point with a little
&quot;white out &quot; will make it clearly visible when it comes to setting your
timing. --
