Subject: My '80 Vangon runs now!

It's really weird, after driving the 12 miles from work (where I had it 
parked) to home, the Vanagon started running great.  I guess it was just 
a bit pissed at being parked for a long time.  I also put some fresh fuel 
in.  Still seems a bit rich at the exhaust, so I put some Redline 
injector cleaner in.  But at least it has power now (at least as much as 
any other vanagon).

Thanks for the suggestions from people.

Bradley
