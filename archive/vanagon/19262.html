  Hello, Hello, anybody out there?


  Can someone pleeeeeasse forward the message Martha posted with directions
  to tonights party. She phoned earlier and told me that she had posted
  the directions &lt;and that I was actually invited&gt; but since I get the

  shall be eternally grateful! Please e-mail me direct at:
