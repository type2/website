I had an intermittant failure of the three instrument panel lights that come
on with the headlight switch when I bought my 84' Vanagon last Dec.  I'd
turn on the lights and the instrument panel lights might have come on
minutes later. They seemed to fix themselves and lighted for a few months.
Then after removing the radio, the instrument panel lights were gone again.
I found and bypassed a torn copper trace on the instrument panel where the
14 point wire connector mates.  Then the instrument panel lighted with
ignition key off and the headlight switch on.  However, with the van
running, no instrument panel lights, no turn signals, no windshield wipers.
I turned off the ignition key and everything worked. 

I tried disconnecting my repairs (including a disconnected wire to the right
heater blower dashboard light and the auto transmission position light), and
have no instrument panel lights, no turn signals, no windshield wipers.
Also, now the blue highbeam indicator light is always on when the ignition
key is on.

Are there any places where the electrical system is vulnerable to wear and
shorting out?
Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? 

Thanks,

Scott Maurer
