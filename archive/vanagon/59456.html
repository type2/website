Derrek,

White smoke sounds like head gaskets to me. About $1,000 to $1,500 to have
done or you can do them yourself.

&gt; Hello
&gt;         I bought my syncro ,a month or two ago, with a blown motor.  I am
&gt; still thinking about putting a Subaru engine in it, but I have been
playing
&gt; around with it,starting it up driving it around a little.  If I baby it,
it
&gt; only smokes a little, but if I the engine revs over 2000 RPM under load
it
&gt; starts blowing dence clouds white of smoke out of the tail pipe.  Besides
&gt; this one anoying habit the engine sounds really good(no rod or main
bearing
&gt; knock) solid like it has  been taken care of .  The owner told me that it
&gt; got oil changes/3000miles and the miles he put on were freeway miles
70-80 a
&gt; day.  The person that I bought the van for had it checked out.  The shop
&gt; told him that the rings were blown.When the engine first started pumping
out
&gt; the smoke he was driving down the freeway and noticed the clouds of smoke
&gt; behind him.  The PO said the water temp was fine and plenty of oil.
&gt; 
&gt; How can I verify the shops diagnosis?  
&gt; 
&gt; I tryed to do a compression test but the neck of my tester was not long
enough.
&gt; Would a lesk down do it?  I would have to rent or by the tool.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought about trying to look at the cylinder with an endoscope but I
don't
&gt; have one.
&gt; 
&gt; What if any other possible explanations for that much smoke?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How much a of a pain is it to put new pistons and cylinders?
&gt; 
&gt; Has  this happened to anyone else?
&gt; 
&gt; How could I verify wether or not it ran out of oil?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your input.
