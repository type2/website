Subject: Front heater motor replacement

Does anyone know of an easy way remove the fan motor in the front heater of
an 85 camper?  My fan motor filled the van with smoke before I could figure
out what was burning.  I thought the woods were on fire until I opened the
window to see where the fire was. It was then that I discovered that the
fire was above my feet!  Luckily, it finally blew the fuse!

Does the dash have to be removed?  Does the stearing wheel drop down out of
the way?  Any idea of a replacement part?  I don't know if the dropping
resistor is also burned out.
