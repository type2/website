Those would be the idle fuel shutoff solenoid, the idle air cutoff solenoid
(not sure if that's the correct name for that one, but that's what it
does), and the choke cover.

&gt;that part is the same on these so I won't
&gt;have any problem with that bit of wiring.  However, the left hand carb
&gt;has this silver, rectangular,  thingy for lack of a better term mounted
&gt;to the upper left side of the left hand carb (when viewed from the back
&gt;of the bus) it has an electrical connection on it and I don't know what
&gt;to hook it to.

Mine is hooked in parallel with the two solenoids and the choke cover.  I
have no idea what it does.  I doubt it does much of anything.

&gt;	My other problem is gasketts.  these carbs seem to be in good
&gt;shape and I don't want to rebuild but I will probably need the
&gt;manifold/carb gasket.  I really don't want to pay $22 for the set if I
&gt;only need the two.  Is there any kind of high temp material that works
&gt;well?

You can buy gasket material at a good auto parts store for a few bucks, and
cut the carb/manifold gaskets out with an exacto knife using an old one as
a template.  I've done this before on that very gasket without problems.
