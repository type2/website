&gt; If you get a '65 or earlier, smog is not an issue - they're exempt.  Like
&gt; I've mentioned before, the only REAL busses are pre '68.

They are exempt *once you register them*.  They still must all be smogged
when you transfer ownership.  This is what the California DMV told me a
couple of years ago.  It could have changed...

&gt; BTW - when will this trip actually take place?  I didn't really pay much
&gt; attention 'cause I though it was a real soon thing, but If you guys are 
&gt; talkin' spring, then my baby might be ready...

Were talkin late spring, like beginning in May and going for maybe 6-8 weeks.
Still Tenative.
