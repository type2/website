Clay,

Gee, the thing that gets me about the US is the place names.
&quot;Redrock Canyons of S/Utah&quot; that sounds like the best place
in the world - peaceful and cool, with some serious off-road
mountain biking - one day I'll be there.

Anyway, there's this guy in england that makes fibre-glass
bumbers for Splits and Early Bay-windows (like yours).

The front bumper comes in three sections just like the
originals and the finish is superb. The price is about 70 pounds
each, which is alot, but new Brazilian bumpers for a '77 will
cost you about 60 pounds each. The fact is you can't buy new
bumpers for a '71, over here anyway.

If you interested I can dig out his number.

Lee.
