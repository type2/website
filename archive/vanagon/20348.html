Subject: Re: peanut butter storage in Campers

Thank goodness for an interesting post today! Jeez! I have been sitting here by 
my computer all day waiting for something juicy to come along about Vanagons, 
and here it is. Not to take away from all you previous posters of today, but 
this one's a real brain teaser.

Derek Drew pries into our collective conciousness by scribbling:
&gt; Many list members like me have campers and keep food in there for the odd
&gt; rainy day. I found some peanut butter in mine that had been in there since
&gt; 1992 (I labeled it), through -20 degree winters and 115 degree-in-the sun
&gt; summers. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does peanut butter go bad?

I think PB is like Twinkies...its virtually unlimited. I have eaten PB much 
older than this and I'm still normknmalsdof, uh, kljdoassdfdffuoi, uh well, I 
can still type a little.
&gt; 
&gt; Does it go bad faster once you open the container?

My experience says &quot;no&quot;, its still ok. PB is tough stuff. Think of it as Elmer's
glue...you can open it as many times as you want, but as long as you close it 
when you're done, it will last forever.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I eat the peanut butter or throw it out?

Is it creamy or chunky? I like both, so I wouldn't throw out either one myself. 
They both go well with beer.

Fluffanutter, now that's another story....

PS. if you want a real answer, they usually have a number you can call on the 
jar.
