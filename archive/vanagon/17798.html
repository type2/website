&gt; &gt;Sounds like you want my van. Though its more of a medium blue.

&gt; Here's the thing though, the '93 EV MVs came out in the following colors:
&gt; Bold Caribbean Teal,  Arctic White, Bordeaux Red Metallic, Jamaican Aqua
&gt; Blue,  and Deep Atlantis Blue.

First I've seen this list.  It also happens that I've seen ALL of these 
colors for EVs within a few miles of my house. And I'm supposing mine is 
the Deep Atlantis Blue.  I wouldn't really caall it a dark blue but it is 
not one of the other blues (as I said I've seen them).  I probably ought 
to check just to sate my curiousisty...
