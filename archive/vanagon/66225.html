&gt; I did not bother drilling these as per Bentley.  I used Vice Grips and
&gt; simply unscrewed mine.  Maybe you'll have the same luck.  They are easy
&gt; to reach -- might as well try.  Then I just re-used them...

I also used vice grips to get mine out--but why do you have to reuse
them--I found the same size hex bolts--easy to wrench on.  What is the
purpose for these break off bolts anyway--to achieve a correct torque
value or tamper proof?

Take care,
