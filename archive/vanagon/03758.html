I talked to a guy selling a '67 bus for $1500.  He said when he pulled 
onto the grounds at 10:00 a guy at the gate said it would be $50 to get 
in with his bus. When he said, &quot;WOW&quot; the guy said' &quot;OK, you can get in 
for $20.&quot;  It was suppose to be $15 to drive in.  It sounds like some of 
the people at the gate were trying to get a piece of the action.
