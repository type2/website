Subject: Re:  My windshield washer heater gizmo

There is a swedish outfit that makes these.  The heat exchanger is a heavy
piece of pipe with about 3 feet (or more) of tubing wound around.  You cut the
rad return hose (the big one) and clamp this thing in-line.  The tubing
is covered by plastic to hold in the heat better.

It also has a check valve so when the washer fluid boils in the exchanger
it causes the fluid to circulate back to the reservoir heating up 
the whole tank as you drive.

I bought the thing at a SAAB dealer in Knoxville TN, don't know of another
source, but it shouldn't be difficult to re-engineer.

Had one for years on my SAAB before I got rid of it.  Worked great - even good
for summer use, the hot fluid melts bug goo really well.

 &gt;As reported earlier, I had a 4&quot; length of 1/4&quot; copper tubing soldered to
 &gt;the side of my rad. To this I connected the windshield washer line in an
 &gt;effort to create an ice-destroying spray! Well, I completed all of the
 &gt;connections last night and tried it out today...it doesn't work! the water
 &gt;doesn't feel at all warm! I guess I should have used a longer bit of
 &gt;copper tubing. Oh, well. I'll wait until next winter, maybe it'll have
 &gt;some effect.
 &gt;
 &gt;Alistair, back to the drawing board
