Subject: 73 Van Sunroof

Folks, 

Thanks for the help here in finding a door for my 73 van.  I'm picking the
car up with its new/old door in a couple of hours.

Next thing I need help with is my sunroof.

Everything seems to work okay - the sunroof slides all the way back and
front, but at the end of the front slide, the rear edge of the sunroof never
rises up level with the roof like it usta do.  It stays down about a half
inch or so when fully forward.

Anybody got an idea why this might be so?  Is it fixable?  Will I have to
take out a mortgage on the garage to pay for the parts?

Any help from resident sunroof gurus would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks, 

John Kinney
