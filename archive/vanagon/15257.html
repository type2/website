here to the list today.  

excerpts....

&quot;...a unique hot lunch box..._dot_called the Burton Stove-To_Go,...
looks like an ordinary lunch box.

.....an insulated container that can carry leftovers, frozen foodst,
etc...turns the food inside into a hot lunch.  Just plug it into
your cigarette lighter, or household electric outlet (note:
it comes with both cords)...

....will make hot sandwiches, heat soups, stews or leftovers,
cooks frozen foods, hot dogs and entrees.  ......ideal way to
heat baby food jars and bottles.  Great for truckers,
boaters, campers, tailgaters. In the car..on the jobsite..
in the office.
