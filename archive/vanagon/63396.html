Subject:      Stuck door lock - 83.5 Westfalia

I unlocked the driver side door with the key, though the lock pull
didn't return to the full top position before I pulled on the door
handle.  The result? - one stuck door lock.

I have pulled the door panel back and tried moving things from the
inside, to no avail, even after gallons of WD-40.

Anyone out there experience a problem like this?  What's the fix.

Please reply to the list with a copy directly to me.  I'll check the
archives when I figure out how to find them at the new location.

Thanks
