Subject:      vwus 800 number for a/c kits

well, i finally got through ... talked with a human named Bridget or
Bridgette (german accent). she seemed about as happy to hear from me
as she would be to have her toes chopped off. she very curtly informed
me that the conversion kits were NOT released yet, that they were in the
development stage, and wanted to know where i heard about this.

after i mentioned 170 bus and vanagon owners, she softened up a little bit
and wanted to know what sort of car i had, how many miles, and where i
lived.

so keep plugging on that phone. :) and be prepared to talk to someone who
doesn't really care about talking to you. :(

i'm gonna sit right down and write themselves a letter ... when i get home.
maybe 29 cents invested now will help next year or the next or whenever.

joel
&lt;besides, i'm planning on buying at least one more vanagon ... and maybe
two ... or three! yeah, right.&gt;
