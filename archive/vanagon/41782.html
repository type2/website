Subject: Bus Boys comes thru

Hi Folks -

I was one of the people with a negative Bus Boys experience during last 
week's thread; in response to my comments they (Jim Thompson) contacted 
me and then shipped the bumper end cap that has been missing since last 
Fall.  I told them I'd tell the list when it arrived, and yesterday it 
did... so I'm now willing to give them another try in the future.  They 
certainly seem to have the best of intentions to serve the Bus/Van 
market, and a generally helpful attitude; hopefully their attention to 
detail will hold up in the future.

regards,
