&gt; I did some more investigating on the Bus this morning.. it looks like it

&gt; 
&gt; Is this major work for a welder to do properly?  I know in a Bug it can 
&gt; be a pain in the ass to replace rockers and floors, but I have never done 
&gt; this on a Bus.

Having done rockers and front floors myself, I can truthfully say it can
be done by an amature with the right tools.  I think its prolly 
easier in a bus since you have less stuff to get in the way!

If you have a place to work on it, I'd suggest doing it yerself.  You can get
a decent lowe-end MIG welder for about $300, and you'll make that back in 
what you save on shop costs.  You should also get a grinder and a jigsaw,
and a good hammer and some good cold chisels.  The jigsaw you'll use to
get the old stuff off (or use good shears - yeah, add that to the list - 
thats what I used) the welder to, uh, weld them in, the chisel to cut
some of the more hard to get spots, like around the frame members, and
the grinder to finish down your welds.

My bus has all new rockers, battery tray, front floors, and hinge carrier.
