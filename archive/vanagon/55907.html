Subject: Re: &quot;Koolatron&quot; cooler

I have the big cooler in my panel Van. We installed it before leaving for
California last year and the thing was on for the whole ride, 5000km! This
little fridge kept us alive through the Mojave Desert! We kept the fridge
packed with water. NO AIR!:( We love this little unit and would highly
recommend it to anyone!

Ps My buddy in Germany has one that run's of a solar cell.
