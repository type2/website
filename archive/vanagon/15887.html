I talked to my friend that has actually camped in the area before, and he
sez Dunes is _the_ ticket, with all the county club amenities... :)

Also, surfing is just down the road fromt he campground; there is a beach
thats part of the campground, nice beach break, but they don't let you 
in until 8:00am so dawn patrol is outof the question (unless you hike your
board in...)

In the area are Salmon creek, Doran beach, Dillon beach and bolinas, just 
off the top of my head...

Ray (my surf bud) might be able to go ('59 standard bus)
