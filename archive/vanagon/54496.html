Subject: Oil Pressure light '83.5 Westy

For the first time in 30k of ownership (150k total) the oil pressure 
idiot light came on when I started-up.  It only glowed dimly and went-off 
and stayed-off with less than 1mi of driving.  This happened twice, ea 
time it was or had been raining and the van was not being driven much.  
Oil has always been topped-off w/20w50 (my understanding is that this is 
basically unrelated to pressure anyways), it runs just like normal (very 
well, also recent major tune-up w/compression test) and has not happened 
again at all (the rains have stopped to).  Could moisture do this?  Has 
anyone else experienced this?  I planning on having a mechanical oil 
gauge installed to be sure, any recomendations on types/kits, etc.?  Is 
it diff. to check the oil press switch on the engine?  I followed the 
wire and it seemed to be pretty buried in there.  Well, that was alot of 
?'s, basically I think the pressure is prob. ok, but I had minor heart 
attacks when the light glowed.  Any advice or sugg. would be valued.

Thanks, Charles Earl
