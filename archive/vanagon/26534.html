Subject: Re: Sewfine? CHEAP BRAKE VACCUM CONTROL VALVE ('71 Bus)! Shocks?


&gt;The in-line control valve on the vaccum line to my brake
&gt;booster died, and not wanting to wait two weeks for my local VW
&gt;dealer to find out that they couldn't get it (yes, I'm a little
&gt;cynical about VW's vaunted customer service), I went to Autozone to
&gt;see what I could work out with their &quot;Universal&quot; parts rack.  I
&gt;picked up a valve (the kind that's supposed to mount right on a
&gt;booster) for three bucks.

My VW dealer flatly said &quot;Forget it&quot;, but I called a few aftermarket
FLAPS, and found a generic one for $8.95, probably goes on a Chevette
or something. Popped it in, clamped it, and voila-- zero brake problems.
They don't even stiffen up instantly when the engine conks out at a
stoplight any more. Not till later, anyway.

This FLAPS actually had it listed for a '71 bus, though it didn't look
anything like the original. I believe certain year Rabbits and Jettas
used something similar, which you can use. Maybe that's what this is?



&gt;Third:  I need some shocks for the front of my bus (same '71).
&gt;Anybody know of a cheap solution?

I put some semi-cheap ones from Sears on my '71. No more shakes!
Installation was easy, too-- shooting them the night before with WD-40
probably helped.
