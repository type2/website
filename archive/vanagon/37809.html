Subject: Re: bus sightings

&gt; This morning my girlfriend and I drove from here (Fredericksburg, VA) to
&gt; Alexandria VA.  It's about an hour's drive.

&gt; Also saw one red EuroVan but it just wasn't the same ;)  (just
&gt; some flame bait for the EuroVan drivers ;)  -- Bill Killian, no need to
&gt; respond, it's just a little joke :) .

&gt; SET ASBESTOS SUIT = ON
