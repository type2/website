&gt;&gt;I also tend to open the wing window (triangle) to keep the fogging down.
&gt;&gt;Those windows do tend to fog up with me huffing, puffing and screamin'
&gt;&gt;at all the idiot drivers who cut me off.

Talking about winshield fogging, one of the great features of vanagon is
that it's windshield is nearly free from fogging even during heavy rains.

During a heavy storm last month I drove my vanagon with a buddy along the
commuter lane on HY101. The rain was extremely heavy that kept the traffic
below 50mph. But my windshield was completely fog free so I just kept
on going at 60+mph on the commuter lane. That was quite an experience.
