fya i just had a bad experience with the bus stop.  ordered a $150
headliner.  got a bunch of retangular pieces of vinal that were unmarked,
wrinkled, stained, the wrong sizes, and insuffient to cover the entire top
of my van.  there were no bows to hold the top against the metal. [even
though the catalog clearly states 'w/7 bows'] there was no provision for the
sunroof hole either.  when i called tech help, they tried to convince me
that all was as it should be.  they just lost a customer.  the headliner's
going back, the catalogue going in the cats litter box [i don't have a cat
but i'm going to buy one just so i can watchit defile the bus stop catalogue]

np...i'm not bitter
