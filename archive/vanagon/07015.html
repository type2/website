&gt;Is this guy pulling our body parts?

as ric said, i think he's yanking someone's chain ... just on the EPA stuff,
i don't think the mex beetles or buses would get by.

however, if you mean do such creatures exist, then the answer is yes. the
mexican plant is still (or was not very long ago) producing the 1968-1979
bus body, but with a rabbit water-cooled engine in it, complete with front
mounted radiator and grill. there have been pictures of it in the vw
magazines.
