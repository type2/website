  aha! grasshopper have dim eyes! ;) there's a trick: you have to take a small
&gt;flat thin object and look on the BOTTOM side of the lever ends ... there's
&gt;a little click-tab under there. push the tab up with the SFTO (small thin
&gt;flat object) and the end of the lever pulls right off. note, if you will,
&gt;the relative positioning of the lever end!! it only goes back on correctly
&gt;one way ... otherwise, it'll bump the next lever down. that is, they go
&gt;back on in pairs, one facing up, the next one down facing down. that sort
&gt;of thing.
&gt;
&gt;hope it helps.

Yup - sure did/does help;  after clean-jerking the 1st one out, the above
became obvious.
Now, about  those of us with age-challenged eyes . . . .
