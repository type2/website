&gt; Has anyone  out there had any experience in removing an air cooled Vanagon 
&gt; fan housing 
&gt; with the engine  in the vehicle? I have had experience installing the 
&gt; engine and all its components so am relatively familiar with the 
&gt; attachment points and labour involved. My concern is not having to drop the 
&gt; engine to remove/examine the oil cooler. Presumeably the fan housing must 
&gt; also be removed to get at the cooler. 

I have no experience with Vanagons, but for my '73, the fan housing must
be removed to get at the oil cooler.  Fortunately it is a simple matter to
get the fan housing off without removing the engine.

&gt; The engine has an aux oil cooler with 
&gt; electric fan but oil pressure will not exceed 30 psi at speed when hot 
&gt; (air temp 78 F). This was 
&gt; even lower without the aux cooler. The  pump and main bearings check out ok
&gt; (75 psi at startup) ...

Be careful about that last statement - just because you have 75 psi at
startup doesn't mean that your main bearings are okay, or even that the
pump is okay.  When the oil is cold and thick, it can take up the extra
space left between out-of-tolerance parts and give the illusion that there
is nothing wrong.

		...so I am left with the possibility that the oil cooler is 
&gt; blocked.- do they &quot;wear out&quot; like radiators?... 

Never seen one wear out.  They can become blocked, though.  Any competent
machine shop should be able to test it to see if it is blocked.  If it is,
don't clean and re-use it, *replace* it.  I have been told by many VW
mechanics that it is a bad idea to re-use a problem oil cooler.

					  The filter is mounted on a 
&gt; remote adapter so this may also create some problems. JCW says that 
&gt; special oil bypass valves are necessary when using remotely located 
&gt; filters....why?

I don't know the answer to that one, but why are you using the remote
adapter?  Oh, I guess it must be where your auxiliary oil cooler is
tapped in, huh?

&gt; PS I am thinking of installing  a grooved oil bypass relief valve and an 
&gt; oil pressure adjuster to boost pressure  if the oil cooler is not the 
&gt; problem- any ideas/experience?

Are you sure it will boost pressure?  The relief valves are only there to
vent excess pressure, if I am not mistaken.  I don't see how fiddling with
the relief valve could add pressure.  Hmmm...  I think you would be better
off going after the source of the problem, which in my mind *must* be one
of two things:

1.  Insufficient pressure being generated due to inadequate pump or worn
    bearings.

2.  Oil is overheating.

I believe #2 is by far the most likely.  I wish I knew more about the
Vanagon engine so I could help diagnose the problem.  I wonder if your
engine has the same trouble-prone thermostat/air-flap setup that mine
does?  That could easily be the problem...
