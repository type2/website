Subject: august campout potluck signups


Yes, I know you all hate this, but it's that time again.  I've left
this to later than usual, in the hopes that you all won't drag on
the issue.  We need sign-ups for our potluck dinners!

Keeping with past tradition, everyone bring their own:
plates, napkins, cups, utensils, serving things
booze
drinks
lunches
special foods

NOTE:  lunches are NOT potluck.  I think I can persuade Jeff Schneiter
and maybe Al Knoll to do their supercalifragilistic breakfast tings
for us again Sat. and Sun. mornings.

Apart from that, our trend has been to do potluck dinners Friday
nite and Saturday nite.  For the sake of simplicity, I'd like to
do what we did the last couple of times and have people bring
the same TYPE of category they sign up for on both nites.  For instance,
if you want to bring dessert for Friday evening, please plan to do
that same type (but a different type of dessert) for Saturday eve., ok?

Here's who we have coming (16 cars!), and what's signed up for
so far:

Jeff:  do you want to do breakfast on Sat. or Sunday?

NB:  sign up now, or you may end up having to bring a dorky entree
like frog's legs or something.  Do it early.  Avoid the rush and the
leftovers.
