Derek says:
&gt;I was able to knock one of my labels off but I can't get the other label to
&gt;come off yet. 

&gt;If you think you can remove your label, by all means DO IT. I used a chisel
&gt;and a sledge hammer and a lot of bending back and forth once it started to
&gt;come off.

You may be right, but I did not do this because 
1)it is illegial for Propane vendors to refuel an unlabeled tank, not that
anyone ever looked
2)  I was concerned about the stress that the aforementioned hammer &amp; chisel
would do tho the tank's integrity.
3) So I chose to Inject that rust reformer stuff liberally under the label.

Also, I assume you had your residual propane vapors bled before you attempted
this procedure.

Just MHO.
