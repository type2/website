Subject: Re: 12volt electric heaters

     
     &gt;That's ALOT of juice folks.  Electric heaters from a 12v system are 
     &gt;not practical in an automobile context.
     
     Indeed!
     
     That's why I'm still gunnin' for the water heat exchanger experiment.
     
     Coz, 44 BHP (that's what my vans got) equals about 32810 Watts!! 
     that's what the engine pumps out. Now most of that drives the wheels, 
     some drives the engine itself and the rest gets pumped out as heat - 
     what a waste! I don't know how much power dissipates as heat bu I'd 
     guess at a good deal more than 1500 Watts (which is only 2 HP)
