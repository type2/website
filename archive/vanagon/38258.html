Subject: No start-it's baaack

Just when I'm feeling good about having chased the ol' no start demon with a
good battery terminal cleaning and tightening, it happens again after at
least a month of behaving. 15 minutes later it starts without a whimper. 

Is the real fix for this the solenoid? Or do I need to fess up that I didn't
get dirty and clean the contacts at the solenoid as well and get back under
there and do it right? How do you know when you've it licked for good ? The
suspense is awful !
