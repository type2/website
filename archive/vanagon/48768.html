&gt;1984 VW Vanagan Waterboxer (that means its watercooled)
&gt;about 200k on it, and we suspect it has a warped head.  It has a
&gt;watertight sunroof and  a variety of &quot;minor body damage&quot;s, but is a swell
&gt;family vehicle for someone willing to put the time &amp; $ into the engine. 
&gt;It runs tho'.  ONLY $700!!!!!  Call now- 206-531-0461 or 206-903-7439  We
&gt;were planning to fix it but we must sell it.  Thanks, Meridith
