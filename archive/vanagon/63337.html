Subject:      euro-spec headlights...

 we shipped a syncro to europe, it ended up in austria.
 for it to be made legal, the headlamps had to be replaced with the
 euro-spec version, big surprise right?
 as has already been discussed the optics are much better. also
 the parking lights are integrated into the headlamp assembly,
  there is actually another small bulb within the headlamp.
 this had to be rewired, as the usa is different.

 the assemblies did use a slightly hotter bulb
 the euro headlamps are available, i think i was looking ae about 200.00 USD
 per side...
 i'll get part numbers and post, although 99% of USA dealers
 will likely refuse to order, since these are not parts for the US
 market, but thats not a problem, there's always a way to get the good stuff.
later
