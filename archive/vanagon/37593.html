&gt;I saw a new camping product recently that looks intriguing.  It's called the
&gt;Car Top Tent, and I read an article about it in &quot;Four Wheel Drive &amp; Sport
&gt;Utility&quot; magazine.  It is basically a folding tent that fastens to roof
racks
&gt;on the top of a car (or Vanagon!).  It consists of a pair of platforms that
&gt;are hinged together and a tent in between.  Then traveling (or in storage)
&gt;the platforms are folded together and the tent is collapsed between them.
 It
&gt;measures 48&quot; x 60&quot; x estimated 10&quot; thick in this state.  When you want to
set
&gt;up for the nite and use the tent, you remove the travel cover and swing the
&gt;top platform up and over with its attached ladder.  The ladder extends down
&gt;to meet the ground and hold up the platform ..............

I ordered one of these tents.  I'll give the list a report when it arrives.
