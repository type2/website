Subject:      ascii sticker stuff

what about the stick figure, used in Fahrvergnugen, but sitting much more
upright (as we all do in our transporters), and sitting on top of the
numeral 2 (for Type 2)??

i tried 'drawing' it in ascii, but it really looks bad. with pen on paper,
however, it doesn't look too bad.

maybe in tiny letters, just about the 2, you could put 'Type'?

mumbling out loud ...
joel
