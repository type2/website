Subject: Re: Digifant Idle Stabilizer

&gt;Does anyone out there have the part number for the idle stabilizer control
&gt;unit.  This is the one located behind the passenger side rear light.  Also,
&gt;has anyone had to replace this part, in if so how much did it cost?.  I
&gt;probably wil regret asking.

There is a recall on July 86 to Jan 87 on the idle stabilizer, main control 
unit AND fuel tank, campaign PB. Thanks to Joel 'Data Bank' Walker for this 
info. VWofA will replace ALL of the above so check it out, in FAQ I assume. 
For Syncros and non. My Syncro was made Feb 87, tim 'no luck' s.
