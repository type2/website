Hi Ark,

Glad to have you on the list.  Could you please post some information of
the heater you have available for the water cooled vanagons.

Charles Michaux

PS.  The heater in my '73 Thing is working great!!

&gt; Please add my name ARK &quot;THE HEATERMAN&quot; MIRVIS to the list.
&gt;
&gt; The nickname &quot;THE HEATERMAN&quot; came from a club fellow, who found out
&gt; about my gasoline heater training and experience streching for over 30
&gt; years. This experience benefited folks who were freezing for many years
&gt; before. I can be of help, particularly at this time of the year for
&gt; owners of air or watercooled Vanagons.
&gt;
&gt; I can be contacted (201)398-6363 (New Jersey). Leave the message.
&gt;
