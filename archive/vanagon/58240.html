&gt; I spoke with Weddle Engineering yesterday on the subject of Audi 5

&gt; the diesel bellhousing will work for an Audi 5 cylinder transplant. 

That's interesting -- the diesel bellhousing will work for an Audi 5 cyl
conversion.  So I guess the block to bellhousing bolt pattern is the same
on diesel 4's as on the Audi 5?  I wonder if the SA 5 cyl. uses a special
sump that bolts to the engine and bellhousing like the 4 cyl. diesel does. 
What about the starter?  On the diesel 4 bellhousing, the starter is on the
transmission side of the flywheel.  On the 5 cyl. I think the starter is
always on the engine side of the flywheel.  There must be some
starter/flywheel combination that enables the 5 cyl. to work with the 4
cyl. belhousing.  

Any information to clear this up would be appreciated.

Jon, good luck on that project!
