Subject: Non-Transplant: Prices of Ahnendorp Wasserboxer Mods

     Recieved a fax from Germany this am:

     Prices for 2.5L Wasserboxer kit, this will suit the 92HP &quot;SS&quot; and
     95HP &quot;MV&quot; Engines.

     Stroker Crankshaft 82mm         2783DM
     Piston and Barrel Kit 98mm      2748
     Head Seal Rings                   80
     Camshaft                         815
     Modify Distributor               350
                        Total        6776DM

     Which works out to US$4705, plus shipping and duty, of course.

     Also, the Digifant needs to be modified to supply fuel for this
     additional displacement, and Ahnendorp does this on their own
     dynamometer. The alternative for those on this side of the pond is
     finding a knowlegable mechanic with a dynamometer (syncro owners,
     it has to be a two axle dynamometer, of course), or buying an
     aftermarket carburation system. You will have to work out your
     own strategy with your local air quality office.

     How much power would this get you? I don't have the Ahnendorp
     catalog yet, and don't know if he even makes any claims. But
     with a 20% increase in displacement, plus a cam (!),
     and certainly with this work you'd also follow Bob Hoovers
     Sermons (tm) on free horsepower, maybe you would see at least a 30%
     increase in HP, to something like 125.

     This strategy will eat up most of the $6000 you were
     saving for that splittie project you've been thinking about. Or
     you could invest in a Subaru engine, Kennedy Engineering adapters,
     and still be able to start the splittie project, if not trick it out.
     $6000 also brings you more than half way to the MSDS 911 conversion,
     if you want real power and it has to be German.

     More on the continuing saga later...
