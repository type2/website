Can anyone help me make a diagnosis of my clutch problem?
It's a '62 bus with non-stock 1500cc engine. Only got it
this summer so I don't know it's full history.

Anyway, symptoms are:
no howling or grinding, just a reluctance to go into gear especially going
into 2nd. Then a sort of clunk as it finally goes in. Feels like the clunk
is right under the gear stick, but I could just be feeling the vibrations
of the cause in the back. 
This has been getting very slightly but steadily worse over the past
months. Recently there's been a &quot;farting&quot; noise as it goes into reverse
which never happened before.  
The clutch cable looks very new but there's no more room for adjusting it.
Clutch pedal free play is not too excessive - about an inch. Sag on the
cable is correct.

Any advice or ideas on possible problems? Is the only
solution to get in there and have a look at it before I'll have a clue
what it could be....................?

Thanks!
Sarah.
