Subject: Grendel &amp; The Man


Do VW buses get pulled over more than other vehicles?  Yes, if we're to
believe conventional wisdom.

On the other hand, Grendel had a posey painted on her nose with a smiley face
in the middle, slogans on the sides, murals of dolphins and stickers pleading
for the legalization of cannibus plastered on her windows, yet we motored
sedately for three days -- more than thirty hours -- down the freeways
without attracting more than amazed stares.

My '65, with its weirdly painted based-in nose, humungous roof rack and
bristle of antennas, regularly flys up and down the California freeways
without being pulled over by the Man (knocking madly on wood).

If VW vans matched the profile of a particular life style you would think the
Border Patrol would show some interest, but I've never been searched, either
at the border or the Gestapo check-points on I-5 &amp; I-15.

Perhaps it has more to do with the local cops &amp; culture.
