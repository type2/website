&gt; if you are really worried about this, go find a junkyard with vanagons. look

&gt; japanese cars do NOT do well ... well, at least up to two years ago (cause
&gt; that's all i've seen in the yards). american cars do NOT seem to do well.
&gt; rabbits and golfs do NOT do well. vanagons seem to all be rollovers or side-
&gt; impacts, right behind the drivers. one rear-ender.

Yeah, I just saw a bus (looked about '76, but what do I know) in the junk 
yard.  It looked like it slid on the drivers side a bit.  And then the 
rear roof section was caved in.  I don't know what they did, but there 
wasn't any blood in the cabin. :)
 
&gt; i can understand why other people would not want to drive one, but i happen
&gt; to like them (ok, so i've been habitualized by vw buses since 1970!).

But what about the pre '68?!?!?   Hehehe  They're the _real_ buses.
