Subject: '83 GL interior available in October

Hope everybody had a good holiday weekend!

Went to Lansing, MI over the weekend and picked up the rear mattress 
from fellow list member Matt Goike (Thanks Matt!). The head gasket job 
is still holding up well as we made the trip with no problems and the 
guage never over 1/2 and the light still sleeping (w/AC on a lot).

Anyway, I'll be off to Allentown, PA in October to turn my GL into a 
weekender with another listie, Chris Turner. Which means my interior 
will be available when I return. Here's the info:

*'83.5 GL wasserboxer*
*Multi-tone tan suede*

-front driver's seat in good shape w/ both armrests. No tears or 
stains, but worn.
-passenger's seat in very good shape w/both arm rests. No tears or 
stains.
-two person scuplted middle seat w/armrests in excellent shape
-three person folding sculpted rear seat with armrests in excellent 
shape
-all side panels (no rear hatch panel) in very good shape.
-original carpet trashed beyond repair by PO, but I have some nice 
all-season brown carpet from Builder's Square to go with it.

Well, that's it. Anyone interested in any or all of it, email me.

Later,

tony
