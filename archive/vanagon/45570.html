Subject: bus boys service (slightly long)

well, here is my bus boys story: i ordered some parts from them on 
thurs, shipped fri, to be delivered 3 day UPS.  thus, they would be 
guaranteed to arrive on wed of the next week.  i was to leave today for 
a trip, and they parts would have been here in plenty of time.

problem 1: the oil temp guage they had in stock was broken, so the order 
did not get sent out until the next monday.  thus i should have had them 
on thurs.  i was not called about this at all.  i called them on wed and 
said, essentially, 'where are my parts?' and they said the above.

problem 2: much worse, on thurs, after the parts did not come, i called 
ups and asked them where the package was, tracking number in hand.  they 
said, 'thats a _ground_ tracking number, sir'  so, bus boys's shipping 
dept mislabeled my package.

so, bill said he can re-send the order next day air saturday delivery.  
i was pleased with this service.  except, he could not locate one part 
(a muffler).  therefore, he sent only the others, and they did indeed 
arrive on saturday as promised, no shipping charge of course.  the 
muffler will be sent to atlanta, where i will be for tues before heading 
out west.  it too will be sent next day air, no charge.

the moral:  bus boys will try their damndest to help us out and to 
rectify their errors (bill even offered to send me a used muffler from 
someone he knew if he could find one; he couldn't), but do not order 
stuff without time to spare.

while i would have preferred just getting my parts on time, i am happy 
with bus boys's service, and would order from them.  only now i know to 
give myself _plenty_ of time for parts to arrive.
