Subject: Shifting, No Clutch

 &gt; Question-Does anyone have personal experience or can advise of the 
 &gt; damage, if any, that may be incurred by shifting without using the 
 &gt; clutch?  This is the second time in my life I have had to limp home 
 &gt; without a clutch (first was with an old Mustang).  
 &gt; 
The trick is matching the engine rpm to that of the gears.  And do not
_jam_ the shifter, just ease it into gear.  Has saved me from getting
stuck many times.  Never ended up needing this technique with my VWs,
but I tried it on the '82 diesel, and it works.  I just cannot believe
that it does not do any damage -- at the very least, it must cause
more wear than shifting with clutch.  Only do it when you need to.
