&gt;&gt;  There is a switch between the push rod tubes on the drivers
&gt;&gt;side which requires tin removal to access. This is a normally closed
switch,
&gt;&gt;held open by good oil pressure.  The control circuit ignores this switch
&gt;&gt;below 2000 rpm.  The other switch is below the water pump, (impossible to
&gt;get
&gt;&gt;at). It is normally closed, held open by good oil pressure. This switch is
&gt;&gt;used all the time. 
&gt;
&gt;Dennis &amp; all,
&gt;The above is not correct about the &quot;normal&quot; position of the 0.9bar switch.
&gt;
&gt;The dynamic oil pressure monitoring system gets inputs from two pressure
&gt;switches.  One switch is closed with no oil pressure and opens when oil
&gt;pressure rises to about 0.3 bar, called the .3 bar switch.  The .3 bar
switch
&gt;is located between the left (driver's side) two cylinders.
&gt;The other switch is open with no oil pressure and closes when oil pressure
&gt;rises to about 0.9 bar, thus called the .9 bar switch.  The .9 bar switch is
&gt;located below the water pump &amp; crank pulley, near the oil pump.
&gt;
&gt;I hopes this helps to clarify.

Jim,  you are correct. I made a typographical error.  The .3 bar switch is
normally closed, held open by pressuer.  The .9 bar switch is normally
closed, held closed by oil pressur.  To all, sorry about the typo.
