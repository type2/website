Subject: Triangle, NC Bus gathering next weekend

 Howdy all, and especially those east coasters. As the self-appointed focalizer
of the Triangle Area Busses, I have decided to call our first Spring Bus
Camp-Out and Get-Together and Hang-out and Meeting for like-minded folks and,
well, you get the picture. Having talked to several others of the faithful, and
reaching no consensus, I shall propose the ever-popular William B Umstead State
Park, here in Raleigh, NC, home of several happy past gatherings. Here, then,
are the specifics:

 When: Saturday, April 27, 1996 (overnight)
 Who: Everyone sharing the love of busses and camping
 What: camping and a group dinner
 Where: Raleigh, NC, William B. Umstead State Park
 Why: ummm, to frighten the other campers, and annoy the rangers???

So, then, if anyone wants directions, please let me know. Also, if you think
you can make it, please let me know. Gates close around 8:00, and the cost is
$9.00 per site, which can be split between 2 vehicles and 6 people. The group
camping area is the first right once entering the park from Highway 70/Glenwood
ave. So, please let me know if you can attend, and I hope to see a lot of
people there!
