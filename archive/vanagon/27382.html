&gt; Due to untimely schedule conflicts for a number of our members, leaving
&gt; so few of us to go camping, I move that we postpone this weekend's
&gt; camping trip, and head for Panamint Springs in 2 weekends from now.
&gt; I feel badly about this, but it seems to be ok with everyone, so
&gt; guess this feels like the right way to go.
&gt; 
&gt; In the meantime, since I was raring to go camping, I'm sort of
&gt; thinking it would be fun to do maybe a one nighter this weekend
&gt; somewhere locally near the bay area.  Any takers?

A one night stand?  I'm in! (no pun intended! Ok, so maybe it was...)

Has to be somewher surfable...
