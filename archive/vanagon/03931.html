I liked John's presentation so much I thought I would use it.
&gt; 
&gt; 1982 Westphalia, CTC 20W50 Heavy Duty Oil, 10K on GEX long block.
&gt; 
&gt; Oil Pressure (psi): (ambient temperature) 65 degrees or lower:

&gt; Startup (idle)Cruising (about 60 MPH) Hill Climbing
&gt; 75psi     	40-65 (after warmup)    35-45 (3rd gear,45-50 mph,5-7%grade)
&gt;    		35-45 (strong headwind)	30-35 (4th gear,45 mph,long climb)
&gt;                                       35-45 (2nd gear,25-30mph,steep)
&gt; 
Please note the oil pressure drops by 10 psi max when the ambient
temperature is above 75 degrees F to a minimum of 30 psi at 60 mph (and
two hours engine time).
Oil pressure also increases after a sustained drive down hills. The oil light
never goes on at idle  regardless of ambient temperature and sits at around
15-20 psi.

&gt; Head temperature (sender at spark plug #3!):
&gt; (&lt;55 MPH) 275-300 deg F
&gt; 60 MPH    300-350 deg F
&gt; 65+ MPH   350-375 deg F
&gt; 
&gt; 	Head temperature never gets much above 360 deg F. During
&gt; normal highway cruising (no hills) it hovers very near 350. But head
temp will increase if driving into headwind (max of 375).
 &gt; 
Please note that I am using a second cooler with duct work and fan. There
was a thread on this (how porsche placed secondary coolers in the fender).
Since I have yet to install a oil temp gauge, I do not know if  the oil is
overheating. The fact that the oil light never comes on at idle is telling
though.
We drove this set up through the Rockies without incident, but were unable
to do so through Yosemite with the stock cooler without sluggishness and
oil light flickering.

My main concern now is that the oil be not too cool - indicators are
condensation in the oil and high fuel consumption. Next week I will put in
10w30 and an annular oil pressure relief valve and decent filter. This should
make a difference given the drop in temperatures in this part of the woods.
