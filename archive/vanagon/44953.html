Subject: more oil temp

one question:  where is the best place to put a temp sensor that doesnt 
require case drilling or engine removal?  why would a dipstick sender be 
better than a sump sender (as mentioned earlier to be the advice of gene 
berg)?  this placement is just below the dipstick, anyway.
