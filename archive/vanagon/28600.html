&gt;Subject: '65 Microbus Deluxe restoration advice?

&gt;1965 VW Microbus Deluxe (21 window van)

&gt;Serious novice about to embark on restoration.

&gt;Any info appreciated.

&gt;p.s. We already have John Muir's book, Steve Johnson's Air Cooled VW
&gt;FAQ, and I've just subscribed to two newsgroups and three mailing
&gt;lists.

Robb,

Saw your post on VANAGON and VINTAGVW (thought I was seeing
double again).  Just *having* the bus to start with, and the
gumption to &quot;embark on restoration&quot; is a sign of good luck
and good karma.

In response to your questions:

1) If anyone knows of a &quot;how-to&quot; book on bus restoration,
they are keeping quiet.  Most of us are still piecing our
books together, haggling with our publishers for 7-figure
advances and stealing as much material from Internet lists
as possible.

2) Most deluxe owners need those.  I do have some exterior
trim I could part with.  Contact me offlist and I'll see
what I can do.

3)  Rust?  You have rust?  Your approach to rust will have
to depend on how much rust, how much time, how much money
you have.  There are some good replacement panel supplies
available if rockers, battery tray, front clip, or other
sections need to be removed and replaced.  Otherwise it
depends on how much work you want to (or can) do yourself.

4) If *restoration* is your intent there are probably lots
of &quot;don'ts&quot;, but it is really up to you to decide.
Mountains of suggestions and advice are available (like the
thermostat thread).

Since I saw two posts, I know about two of your sources.  Is
NEATO among your subscriptions?  I have recently finished
(well, almost) restoring my '67 Deluxe and have a '67 Westy
and '67 Double Cab lined up in the barn for the next
projects.

I have written 10 chapters, focusing on my '67 Deluxe and
its restoration, which have been in the NEATO Old Bus Review
newsletter and may be of some help to you.  Contact me
offlist and I can forward some of those to you if you want.

You've taken the first step.  Glad another old bus is being
saved.
