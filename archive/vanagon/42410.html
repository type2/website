&gt; just got my GEX engine.  I have all of the accessories from the engine I
&gt;used to have.  NOW what should I do.  I noticed that there was a little tag
&gt;near the distriributor mount which said &quot;Do not rotate engine until dist is
&gt;installed&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Why?
&gt;
&gt;

Because turning the engine clockwise will cause the gear to push up.  It can
then jam up and destroy the brass gear on the crankshaft.  I guess theve had
problems with this in the past so they now put this warning label on.
