&gt; Does anyone know if an ECU from an '84 with a 1.9L and a/c will work on an

No.  It won't work.  The 1983.5 to 1985 vans use an ECU for their Digijet
fuel injection that is significantly different than the 1986-1991 Digifant
equipped vans.
  
&gt;  If not, anyone know of a reasonable $$ source for a good one.

Sorry, can't help with that one.

Good luck,
