Subject: Replacing Propane Regulator

I need to replace the propane regulator on my '87 Westy.

I already know the deal about getting the Marshall 290 (cuz they don't make
the 260 no more) and trimming the plastic shield.

What I don't know is whether or not I should undertake this job myself.
Looking at it, it appears to be a simple task, but I don't want to screw up
and wind up with a propane gusher - either during the install or after.

Has anyone done this themselves? If so, what's the blow by blow, and what -
if any - special tools or precautions are required?

Thanks!
