Subject: More questions on my '85
Date: Fri, 11 Nov 1994 12:29:24 -0800 (PST)

I hope I am not being to much of a pain here,  I have lotsa questions.

When the engine is cold on this '85, the idle is about 900-1000 RPM.  
When warmed up to normal operating temperature the idle increases to 
1400-1600 RPM.  The van also seems to be getting not so good gas 
mileage--not sure of the figures (and in fact, I don't know how much the 
tank really holds) but in 90 miles of driving, I have used 1/2 tank 
according to the fuel gauge.

Also, could someone explain the heater/fresh air controls, they seem 
indordinately complicated (I also have a rear heater as well).  The four 
levers seem like a carry over from the old '71 bus but I don't think 
right and left have much to do with the controls.

Thanks in advance...--
