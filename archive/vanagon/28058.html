Mentioning that table, has anybody had theirs get stuck down?

Right after I got the van, of course I was showing everybody all the cool 
things about it and went to pop up the table and it would not come loose.

It took a over a month of patient banging on the thing till one day, it 
just came loose like it was suppose to.  I haven't put it back down, 
waiting to check out exactly what holds it in there so well.  VW should 
have put a back door into getting that thing loose.

It was a pisser.
