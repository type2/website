&gt; Subject:       How much are those cool awnings?

&gt; How much are those awnings that are attached to the side of the 
&gt; vanagons?  We would love to have one for our Westy.  Does anyone know a 
&gt; place in So. Cal. that carries and installs them?
&gt; 
Hi Alice.  I live in British Columbia, but I have a 10' Apollo awning 
on our Westy.  It's great as it covers part of the passenger front 
door so when it is raining out so you can have the sliding door open 
fully.  Most awnings people put on are only 6 or 7' and they won't 
permit a fully opened sliding door when it rains.  Not sure how much 
that means to you, but for us up here on the Wet Coast, it's 
important.  We paid just over $500 (CDN) in 1990 for it.  

Hope this helps.

Harry.
