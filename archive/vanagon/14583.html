Last weekend I replaced my sickly 002 3-rib transmission on my 72
Bus.. A fact I reported in some inebriated depth night before last.

To update:

The transplant donor was a later model 77 Bus.  Upon inspection it
looked like it had all the trappings of a well healed commuter van
from the DC area (inspection sticker) but what it was doing down here in
Florida I'll probably never know (any other lurkers out there get in
a side-on with their monkey-shit brown 77 Bus and something big/hard and blue
last fall/winter? ).

As a side bar to the discussion of removing the engine/tranny combo on a 72
suitcase -vs- dropping just the engine, I'd say it truly depends
on the quantity of available friends, the surface on which you intend
to work on/in, and the initial reasoning behind wanting/needing to
do this type of stuff in your spare time...  When I'm swapping motors
or after having rebuilt one I'd prefer to test said motor out of the bus/
bug as it is much easier to fine tune stuff from a sitting position than it
is scrunched up in Hell's closet trying hard to keep my poneytail out of
numerous spinning/sucking/turning places.
If on the other hand you are pulling said motor cause you need to put
in a new rear seal, new clutch/TO, then I'd suggest just pull the motor.

Returning to tranny dialog.........

To shorten my story I left the test drive till yesterday as it rained most
of the first of the week and I had to wait until the new starter came in.
I adjusted my shifter plate (2nd gear, bottom of shifter perpindicular,
slanted part kicked back 30degrees) and tightened both bolts down.
Hopped in, fired her up, let the new oil slosh about a bit, then stuck it
in first and pulled out of the drive. Shift smoothly to second..... Ooot,
no second, car behind me.... try third, snicked into third fine...tootle
down to the end of the road and as I try fourth...... no fourth.

Stop

Check my plate adjustment again (roadside mechanics...) now I notice
I mistook the smooth effortless shift-test as a sign of going through the
moves without engaging anything. Kinda like our local Congressman.

I limp home from first to third and push Buster back (no reverse...are
you seeing a pattern here?) into the garage where he sits overnite as I
call my FLAPS and see if they can procur a Shift H saddle/bushing kit.

I'm not sure this is it, but I slacked and installed the old one instead of
doin the &quot;right&quot; thing and putting in a new one.  

Any other ideas?

to recap:

I've got a nice smooth shift into 1st &amp; 3rd (pushing the linkage)
I've got nuthin but air in 2nd, 4th &amp; reverse (pulling the linkage)

Is it possible the linkage arm on the later model (77 buses) is perhaps
a different length than on my 72 bus?
