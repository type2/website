This past Saturday my family was having a garage sale
and this gentleman sees my '65 bus parked to the side
and asks,&quot;Are you into Volkswagens?&quot; I respond quickly
by saying,&quot;No, that is just our guest quarters.&quot;

Anyway, he went on to say that he had two squarebacks and
one van he was selling:

'71 Squareback - manual, new interior, runs
'72 Squareback - automatic, blown engine

will sell both for $500

'75(he thinks) Van - runs and is complete(what that means, I don't know)

didn't say how much he would sell it for.

I didn't have much time to talk to him because I was trying to
negotiate a price with a customer wanting my daughter's
Barbie's Doll House/Swimming Pool Set with wardrobe and lounge
chair(finally settled for $2 bucks).

The gentle left his home phone number =&gt; (206)348-5988 and lives
North of Seattle WA.
