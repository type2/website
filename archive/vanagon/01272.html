&gt;Now that a few of you have brought the subject up, I remember to ask if
&gt;anyone has ever found a solution to loose wipers.  The splines seem to have
&gt;worn just enough to slip a little no matter how tight I fasten the wiper
&gt;arms.  I've thought of drilling a hole for a set screw, but I don't think I
&gt;want to weaken the system.  Some sort of metal epoxy seems a little too
&gt;permanent, but maybe something like hot glue might work...

i had this problem on a much older bus and tried to solve it by deepening the
grooves in the wiper arm end ... it worked for a while, but i wound up having
to get another wiper arm. it seemed like the wiper harm is made of softer
metal than the wiper shaft (and probably a good thing, too!).

is it just one wiper arm or both? if one, i have a 'spare' laying around my
junk room somewhere ... my 88 bus came with one 'winged' wiper arm, so i
bought a 2nd 'winged' one for the other side. :)  and i still have the
non-winged arm somewhere ... i'm pretty sure i do.

as to what causes this, i can only guess that some wiper arms (and/or shafts)
are just incompatible as to tolerances ... that is, if you allow +/- .5mm
(or whatever) on each piece, sooner or later you will get two pieces that are
both too loose (or too tight). or maybe Hans and Frans didn't tighten it
enough at the factory. (i had a window crank handle once that was put on by
Arnold Schwarzenegger! wound up have to actually drill the damn screw out!
... i think he epoxied it in.)

i haven't had this problem on vanagons, but i have seen others who did.
