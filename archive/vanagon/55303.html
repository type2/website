&gt;well... sitting on the dealers counter is the Winter 1996 issue of
&gt;Volkswagen World.  and inside this issue a a write up with lots of photos on
&gt;the Inuvik trip.  and gee, kinda sounds like VW sponsored it.  naw, mebbe it
&gt;be my corrupted brain.  only one paragraph.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Volkswagen lent support to the venture by providing the participants with
&gt;oil changes and extra air filters to combat the dusty roads they'd be
&gt;traveling.  The company also gave Ron Lussier the use of a Volkswagen
&gt;EuroVan camper for the duration of the event.&quot;

Well, they did give us the filters (and loan me the Eurovan.)  I consider
them sponsors.  In return they got to use my photos (the majority of the
shots for the article) and a some of Tobin's photos.

Pretty good shot of me at the mosquito sign, eh?  After we took that
picture, we were swarmed my more mosquitos than I've ever seen in my life.
I can now believe that those suckers can bleed a bear dry.

Everyone should pick up a copy of this.  It's a great article (IMHO :-).
