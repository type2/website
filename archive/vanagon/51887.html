Subject: Diesel Westy: How slow?

I only drive diesels, Rabbits, Jettas and now a lovely 78 Mercedes.  
Am looking at a diesel westy and have been reading this group for the 
past two months or so.  

How slow is it really?  Is it like a 71-71 Westy (single carb, 1600 
aircooled?) or is it slower.  One person told me it can't pass 55.  
That seems impossible, but if true would effect my decision.

Thanks for any input you are willing to send.  The one I am looking at 
has 2500 miles or so on a new engine.
