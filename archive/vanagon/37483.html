&gt;I heard that Bosch had some problem with the chips in the FI brain,

&gt;the manufacture cycle (don't know whose chips).  This was a possible 'real' 
&gt;cause of the brains going nuts and acelerating wildly.  This cracking 
&gt;problem currently limits the number of substrate layers that can be used to 
&gt;fabricate chips. Otherwise multi-level 'thick' chips with higher density per

&gt;footprint size would be possible.  The internally generated heat also leads

&gt;explanation??

Un attended accelaration in Audis was BS.  No mater what the electronics
does, you still nedd to open the throttle to get enogh air flow to make any
power.  I owned an 84 5000 turbo.  Engine still did not make enough power to
rule the brakes useless.  This problem was not cause of Audi's losing thier
resale value.  All the pieces falling off made the car hated.  Especially the
power steering system and windows/sunroof.
