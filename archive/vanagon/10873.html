Another spot to watch is are the connections from the expansion tank to
the rest of the cooling system. The plastic hose barbs do get brittle and
break.
I believe all of the plastic and rubber parts in an older vanagon should
be looked at very closely, especially before &quot;the big summer holidays&quot;,
the vanagon engine compartment is a hot place, accelerates the ageing
process, heck it take s years off my life and I only work in there
occasionally :)
