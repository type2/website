&gt; Well I certainly hope this isn't the problem w/mine (it's a '79.)  We'll
&gt; wait and see.  It's still dribbling oil like a seive though. . .I poured a
&gt; 1/2 quart in while it was running and it seemed to mostly come right out
&gt; again...

Ok, ok, ok!  _I_ had a frightening experience involving dime / quarter / 
loonie sized oil drops pouring out under the engine while manuvering into 
a &quot;flat&quot; camping spot at a beautiful spot beside a rushing creek up in 
the mountains--about 75 km from the nearest pavement.  Ooops.  

Noticed this when trying to get traction on a momentarilly 
stuck/spinning rear wheel when the camper was pointing downhill at a 
crazy angle.  Notice: We dumped oil on to the ground while pointing 
steeply downhill; Steve Maher dumped oil coming to a stop--in both 
situations, any oil that might be lying around is pushed to the front of 
the vehicle.

I'd noticed before (and I checked then, believe me!) that the oil level 
was dropping a lot faster than normal.  I'd say Peter Lima's description 
of &quot;dripping oil like a seive&quot; describes our situation pretty well.

Total repair cost?  Zero.  Time invested in repair?  Maybe 12 seconds.  
Problem?  Oil filter unscrewed and was nearly ready to fall off!

D'oh!!  I check the tightness of the oil filter before every long or 
off-road exploring trip now.  I'd hate to pollute our wilderness with 4 
litres of used 20/50--also hate to risk blowing the motor by running it 
for even a few seconds with zero litres of oil in it!
