Subject:  Garcia &quot;poster&quot;? 

I sent away for the VW Jerry Garcia &quot;poster&quot;.
What I got was an 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; piece of paper with a 4&quot;x5&quot; with about
25 stroke 'charcoal' drawing of a bus. 
Is this the &quot;POSTER&quot;? 
When I think poater, I think &gt; 24&quot; x 36&quot; 
I'm underwelmed!
