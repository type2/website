Subject: Re: Help on Brake Drum.
Date: Sat, 22 Apr 1995 10:54:04 -0500 (CDT)

&gt;Replacing a rear brake cylinder in my friends '65 Kombi.  I can't get 
&gt;the brake drum off for the life of me.  Tried a hammer, lots of WD40, 
&gt;etc.

I poke a long, blunt, screwdriver from behind the drum (through one of the
peek holes in the brake plate) and bang it with a hammer. Turning the
wheel at the same time will help unwedge the drum evenly. Of course, I
suppose there are more elegant methods--if you have the tools.

Good luck!
