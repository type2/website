Subject: Swing Axle Bug to bus questions.

        
Ok I found out yesterday that my '64 bus has an early bug transmission in
it.  The reductions boxes are UP SIDE DOWN, to make it go foward not 4
speeds backwards (which would be kewl anyway).  So how do I fix my e-brake
cables?  The cables are just hanging there and the holes in the backing
plates are on the wrong side.  Can I just switch sides (the plate sides)  or
is it recommened I cut holes in the plates to put the cable through.  Also
what type of problem will I have with putting new brakes in.  The current
ones don't have the e-brake levers.

I was also told this type of setup is a strong at hell, is that true?

Thanks for answers to any of these questions.
