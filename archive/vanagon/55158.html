Only if you can restart immediately and the problem has gone away

I wouldn't think that a clogged filter would cause it to surge.

Must it cool down to correct the problem?  If NOT, then it's NOT this
sensor.  If so, maybe, but not necessarily.  Mine only cost $12, but
that's for an '87 model.  The '84 takes a $40 one, I don't know about
83.5.

Check your vacuum hoses, connections, and mating of air intake boot to
air box.  Heat can cause some leakage in old hose connections.

Visually inspect plug wires and dist. cap as well for wear.  Check
wiring  and inspect for possible internal damage.
