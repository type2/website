Subject: Audi info?  (flame me)

The deal, you Audi lovers.  Wifes New Yorker has finally been pronounced
worthless/DOA by someone other than myself. She believes the local garage
guys. An '86 Audi 5000 Turbo is avail. cheap. 110K miles. Any sage advice on
what could be wrong and how to figure that out would be well appreciated.  

The vanagon content you ask? Well, since the Audi engine will fit into a
vanagon, you figure it out. ;&gt;.  bye, tim
