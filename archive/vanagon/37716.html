Never had mesquite-grilled Japanese eggplant strips along with that
steak? Dude, you've really been missing something - I mean, isn't that a
backyard you've been hanging out in in *California* ;-) ?  

Grilled eggplant is one of my BBQ faves: cut it lengthwise, brush
lightly with EV (&lt;= VW content!) olive oil, maybe a little salt. Serve
with your steak, grilled taters and maybe a loaf of sourdough.  I'm as
much of a red-blooded meat eater as the next Amur'can, but don't make
away my grilled red peppers, zuchinis, scallions, garlic bulbs...
