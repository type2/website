Subject: Lousy Type I Heads

Greetings folks,
I've been trying to identify a shop/vendor that sells the worst heads 
I've seen.  This is my best ascii impression of the logo they stamp in 
them.  



                   |\
                   |  \
                   |  _ \
                   |_| |_ \
                   | | |___ \
                   | |______\ \
                   |____________\     (A triangle w/a &quot;t&quot; in it)

I've encountered four of these heads and between them, they've had two 
burnt exhaust valves, one burnt intake valve (!), one exhaust port that 
was welded 2/3rds shut, and a partridge in a pear tree. 

I would love to know who is putting out this crap so I can avoid them 
and pass the word.

Thanks for any help

-Tom
