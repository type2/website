Subject: Re: VANAGON digest 171

first of all, i am goint to try to turn off the digest mod for this 
mailing list.

i have found that i would rather get the messages individualy, rather 
than in one big one.

i may have to unsubscribe and then re-subscribe to do it, but i am 
composeing this message while waiting for the listserver to send me the 
help file....

and there it is, about 3 minutes after i sent out the rrequest for help, 
it's back. very nice.

next, i would like to thank joel for showing so clearly what i was trying 
to say about checking the costs for regular and premium.
it was the METHOD i was trying to push, not premium.
joel shows exactly what i had in mind, fit the fuel to the situation.

and as far as will it allow it to run cooler, i think the message about 
it preventing pre-ignition under a load was  good explination.

yes, i definetly want to get out of digest mode.
