&gt;This sounded like the greatest thing to have in my 'falia
&gt;for road trips.  In the latest Marlboro catalogue ...

next time you are out on the fringes of civilization, check in the 'store'
section of the local truck stops (big trucks, big stops). they sell those
things (made by Coleman or Igloo), and sometimes have 'sales' ... i've seen
them for as little as $89. &lt;just haven't decided to give up my old antique
melting-ice cooler yet&gt;.
