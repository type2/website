Subject: high idle blues

After paying little attention to the hi-idle threads, now I'm plagued...
85 Digijet idles fine until engine is completely warmed up, then it surges
and drops in a wavelike fashion.  I noticed that it continues to do so while
coasting, and recall someone suggesting that the injectors are supposed to
shut down completely when coasting?
Could someone please suggest the sequence of fuel system checks that might
lead to a solution?
Thanks,
Jim
