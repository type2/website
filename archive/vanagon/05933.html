&gt; From: &quot;Norman Leong&quot; &lt;norman_leong_at_synoptics_dot_com&gt;

&gt; On 10/31/94, Martha wishes to classify herself:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;flannel, WEST CALIFORNIA, air head (oops, I mean cooled)
&gt; 
&gt; Would this be the part of CA that falls into the Pacific and makes
&gt; Steven and Thom instant millionaires by making their homes beachfront
&gt; property with the next BIG ONE?

	Norman, Norman,
	The WESTERN part of the San Andreas Fault is moving NORTH and
RISING. We'll be in Seattle soon, where Martha's flannel shirts are
the height of fashon!

	Bill
