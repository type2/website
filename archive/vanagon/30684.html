&gt; I ran across this at an auction web page.  The site is:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.ebay_dot_com:80/aw/
&gt; 
&gt; Look under &quot;autos&quot; to view the listing.  
&gt; 
&gt; Onet is described as a '60 Double Door VW Bus and listed at bid for 
&gt; $600.  The other is listed as a '58 Type II Deluxe and the listed bid 
&gt; is $1500.  
&gt; 
&gt; I know that these are pretty rare and thought that I would mention it 
&gt; for the benefit of the &quot;old&quot; bus fans here.
