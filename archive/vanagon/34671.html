Subject: Re: brake fl leak

&gt;My '71 bus has TWO (count them, two) plastic brake fluid reservoirs.
&gt;One is behind the driver's seat, and looks kinda like the one that
&gt;was up against the front sheet metal in my old '69 bus. Is this the one
&gt;that RMMW has?

I can't comment on the availability of the upper reservoir: don't know if
that is available or not.  RMMW lists both the upper and the lower (on the
mast cyl) in the catalog, but what is in the catalog isn't always
necessarily available so best to call if you need one.

&gt;The other one, mounts directly on top of the master cylinder, by the
&gt;front axle, and is very odd-shaped. It's connected to the first (upper)
&gt;reservoir by a long hose. Anybody know if this second (odd-shaped) one,
&gt;is also available or not? It's probably unique to '71 and later busses,
&gt;since these had power front disc brakes ('70 and earlier had drums in
&gt;the US).

The one that mounts directly on the mast cyl is the one we're talking about.
It fits 68-72 buses and as far as I know, is not available new.  The major
difference between this 68-72 reservoir and the later reservoir is the
distance between the two nipples (There, I said it! nipples nipples!) on the
bottom of the reservoir that fit into the fluid inlets on top of the master
cylinder.  From memory, I believe the distance between the nipples on the
68-72 models is like 3 1/2&quot; center to center and the later reservoir is &gt;3.5&quot;.

&gt;From experience I can say that you are more likely to break one removing it,
than installing it! I ended up finding a good used one.  I figure by the
time I need another master cylinder some company will be reproducing them.
