&gt;I am going to be repacking the CVs sometime soon, so I will be making
&gt;the trip to the FLAPS today. I forget offhand, do the inner CVs on
&gt;a '71 Bus have CV grease in them, or are they lubricated by tranny oil?

definitely GREASE! the only real difference (that i have ever seen) between
the beetles (double-jointed ones, anyway) and the buses is that the bus
joints are bigger. most definitely grease them. :)

i, uh, don't suppose i could interest you in a little how-to-grease-cv-joints
story? :)
