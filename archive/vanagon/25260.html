Subject: Dripping antifreeze problem

Dear folks,

My 87 Westy is dripping antifreeze -  big time.  It seems to coming from the
plastic area in the engine compartment.  It's not coming from the overflow
which was subsequently sucked (near) dry. Temp gauge stayed in the mid range
but when I stopped after a 40-mile drive that sweet sickening smell of
coolant caught my attention.  That's when I noticed the major drip.  Is this
the dreaded head gasket?

Any advice appreciated,

Ajax.
