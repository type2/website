Subject: Is my gasoline supposed to be orange and flaky? [T1]

All:

Well, I guess the subject line pretty much explains this one.  I read all
the Hoover sermons on rusty tanks and no, I don't want to deal with
acid-etching anything.  So, is there anything else that can be done short of
replacement?  If not, where does one buy a decent replacement tank?  I don't
recall ever seeing one advertised.  As usual, any suggestions would be helpful.

Bob J.
