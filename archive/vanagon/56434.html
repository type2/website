Dave,

There are different load ranges for tires (different levels of reinforcement).

With the higher level of reinforcement goes higher maximum rated inflation 
pressure and load carrying capacity.

The biggest risk of overinflating tires is in the area where the tire mounts 
to the wheel.  There are steel hoops, called beads, that hold the tire onto 
the wheel (rim).  Overinflating tires will cause excessive strain on these 
beads and can cause them to fail.  The problem is, when a bead fails the tire 
tends to EXPLOODE off the rim, and that's where the major risk is.

People have been decapitated while mounting tires to rims because they 
overinflated the tire.  That's why you see cages in tire shops to contain 
tires while they are being inflated.

Also, if you overinflate the tire and then hit a pothole or curb, you may 
damage the reinforcing cords in the sidewall of the tire.  Once 1 or 2 cords 
are broken, the neighboring cords see excessive strain, which causes them to 
break, which causes their neighboring cords to see excessive strain, which 
causes them to break, ..., ..., ...,..., and you end up having a chain 
reaction that causes the sidewall of the tire blow out!

The fact that you bought 185R14 reinforced Michelins means that you have more 
than adequate tires for your bus, unless you plan to use it to haul heavy 
loads at it's maximum load capacity, which is not typical.

If you plan to put 205 sized tires, you will need to use P205/70R14 tires to 
maintain the same tire diameter, which might be too wide for the rims you 
have.  Check with your tire dealer.

I would not recommend putting P205/70R14 tires on the rear and 185R14 tires on 
the front.  This will probably upset the handling of your bus, causing 
excessive understeer.  Recommend using same size tires front and back.

You will not see a big increase in load capacity going to a 70 series tire, if 
that is your goal.

Benifits of P205/70R14 tires:
  - Improved ride and handling
  - Longer tread life

Negatives of using P205/70R14 tires:
  - Heavier steering (if used on front)
  - More wear a tear on steering gear (if used on front)
  - Less steering feedback (if used on front)
  - Reduced traction in snow
  - Increased unsprung weight
    - May affect handling
    - More wear and tear on suspension components

&gt;Hmmmm. I stand (or drive) corrected. I'll have to recheck my tires. I do 
&gt;use Michelins with reinforced sidewalls, so I know I have the correct 
&gt;tires. Maybe my inflation pressure on the tire is higher, and I just 
&gt;don't remember it.
&gt;
&gt;[Next morning, 7am. My tires are Michelin XZX, with 40 lbs. Max cold 
&gt;pressure. I'm a bit shocked at having given dangerous advice to the list, 
&gt;and very glad people caught it. The sad part is that a staff member at a 
&gt;tire place set me on the &quot;sticker path&quot; years ago. The sadder part is 
&gt;that I never questioned it.]
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the warning.
&gt;--Dave
&gt;PS--Remember Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when Hunter S. Thompson 
&gt;filled the tires up to 110lbs. so they'd make the right squeal going 
&gt;around corners? Now _there's_ a serious judgement problem. (this book was 
&gt;fictionalized, BTW) 
&gt;
&gt;PPS--I'm switching over to 205 tires from 185 tires. Can I do it 
&gt;gradually, putting the two 205s on the rear wheels and leaving the 185s 
&gt;on the front tires for a few thousand miles? or will I mess up the ride 
&gt;and the tires? I hate to just replace the front tires, they're still in 
&gt;such good condition. anybody want to buy a Michelin XZX 185 or two for a 
&gt;good price?
