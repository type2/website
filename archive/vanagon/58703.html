Subject: Rebuilt alternator for my 91 Carat

Went out to the Carat this morning and noticed that I'd left the cell phone on (sorry joel, but it 
is hands-free) since Friday night and the beast wouldn't start. Wife hade the jumper cables with 
the Toyota, and didn't want to wait for AAA so it stole the battery out of the '75. It fired right 
up and got me to work.
At lunch, I went to my &quot;flsars&quot; (friendly local starter and alternator rebuild shop) who load 
tested the battery and said that it only need a charge and then asked me if I wanted the charging 
system checked out, which they did and said that the regulator output was at 13.75 volts and would 
need to be repaired.
They quoted me a price of $125.00 for a rebuilt 90A bosch alternator.

Two questions, is 13.75 volts a bad reading for an alternator, and does $125 for a rebuilt 
alternator seem resonable?

TIA
