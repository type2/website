&gt; The fun that can be had is still beckoning to me, but economic reality is
&gt; trying to put me in a headlock. I'd really appreciate it if someone could
&gt; post what it costs them to own a wasserboxer. Insurance costs, oil/gas,
&gt; parts/maintenance, etc. I realize there is probably a premium involved
&gt; here, since the *bus* is the thing, not necessarily the economy of it, but
&gt; I'd still like to know...

Jim,

I can help get a handle on all of the above except the
insurance bit.  I bought my '84 GL new in November of 1984
and have kept good records over that ten year span.

Maintenance:

Regular oil/filter changes twice a year, replaced a starter,
replaced a water pump, replaced exhaust twice, replaced
muffler 4 times, replaced catalytic converter, replaced coil
&amp; plug wires, bought 2 extra wheels, replaced clutch slave
cylinder, had brakes done twice, replaced 2 CV joints, got a
Bentley manual, replaced tires twice, replaced windshield
seal and several bumper endcaps.

Total expenditure: $6,823

Gas:

Over 84,000 miles, put in 4,699 gallons of gas (17.9 mpg).
Burned the good stuff, AMOCO Gold 90% of the time, and have
had no fuel system problems at all.  Total gas costs $5,970
(avg $1.27/gallon).

You do the rest of the math.  After purchase was paid for, I
paid approximately $680 a year in maintenance, plus gas.
Always started (even when I needed a new starter), never
stranded me, carried a LOT of junk and people.  Now needs
new main seal.

That help?
