Subject: (sand)Blasting Thom

Hey - I thought this was a quasi 'family' oriented show - this list, that 
is...so what's all this 'bout prostate (gland, not usual VW position) 
being checked with leather gloves, flaccid short third legs, Trojan 
references, &amp; putting an inside-out prophylactic in yer garage???

But seriously though folks - a bunch of 3/4&quot; pvc pipe &amp; fittings + a 
bunch of those blue tarps can make a pretty decent sandblasting or paint 
booth, or even an emergency carport if you have understanding neighbors.

Austin
