&gt;&gt;The bus ran great but I have a slight problem with the
&gt;&gt;heat system. I don't have any kind of aux. heater so I'm stuck with the
&gt;&gt;heat exchanger stuff. It sort of works but I'm getting this obnoxious odor
&gt;&gt;through the tubes. It smells like a combination of dirty, greasy engine and
&gt;&gt;gasoline, mixed with a faint whisp of exhaust. Is this normal? (BTW the bus
&gt;&gt;is so full of holes I'm not to worried about asphyxiation, (Sometimes I
&gt;&gt;even get snow drifts INSIDE the bus)
&gt;
&gt;I was driving my drafty old '69 in Pennsylvania one winter day and stopped
&gt;to get Wendy's french fries (the fat, ---steaming---, fluffy kind - BTW, I
&gt;have no personal affiliation with Wendy's). This was my get-warm ritual.
&gt;Well, this particular day was about 20 degrees and 100% relative humidity.
&gt;As I sat in my beast eating the french fries, the steam rose to the
&gt;ceiling, cooled on its way down, and, I sh*t you not, fell as snow into the
&gt;speedo cup to a depth of about a millimeter!
&gt;
&gt;There! can anyone else claim actual meteorlogic activity inside their bus?
&gt;I think (also hope) not.

The family stopped by a local barbeque establishment picking up ribs and
beans to go.  On the way home, the little ones got very hungry and the beans
were consumed.  Global warming then ensued.:)
