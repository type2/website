Subject: table for vanagon westies


If you aren't into being &quot;period correct,&quot; you might check out this
table (16&quot;x32&quot;) at campingworld.  I just got one to repace the icky
one in my '81 westy.  It's about the same dimensions, but has chrome
(yes, chrome!) legs on the bottom side, which fold down, so that
you can remove the table from it's prop inside the camper and use
it outside or freestanding in the camper.  I like it a lot better
than the stock table.  All I had to do was to unscrew the existing
hardward from the old table (4 screws) and reattach it to the
bottom side of the new table.  The table cost around $50, but is
I suspect far cheaper than repacing the original, (I couldn't find
one in a junkyard), and has the added multi-functionality.
