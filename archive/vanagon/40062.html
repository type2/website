I would like to search the archive for the vanagon list.  I don't know how to
use the archive.  My very limited instructions tell me I can issue the command:

index [archive | path-to-archive] [/password] [-all]

What is the name of the vanagon archive?
What is the path to this archive?
Is a password required?

Any helpful hints for a novice archive user?
