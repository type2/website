Subject: Re: weird problem w/ poor 85 Westy gas mileage


&gt;I found that the vent tube that runs from the fuel tank overflow bottles
&gt;(near the gas tank) to the canister (forward of passenger side engine) had
&gt;become disconnected at a junction by the frame.  Easy find and easy fix, huh?
&gt; not so fast.  Now my mileage has improved dramatically but is still only
&gt;about 16 mpg around the city?
&gt;

Only 16 mpg around the city?  In a Westy?  What the heck are you expecting?
That is more than what you should get, don't mess with anything else!
You'll just reduce the milage.  These heavy vehicles are only supposed to
get 18-19 on the highway, although many (including myself) have gotten as
much as 21mpg.  But more than 16 in the city is just not to be expected.
