Subject: Oil light/buzzer
From: s_j_wacker_at_juno_dot_com (STEVEN G WACKER)

Hey guys, I finally have a problem (hope it's not a portent of things to
come). Today, on my way to four wheeling in the San Bernadino National
Forest the oil light and buzzer came on when I slowed for the boarder
patrol checkpoint. It only buzzed for a few seconds and we went on. The
checkpoint is at the top of a long grade and the buzzing started when the
RPMs dropped below 2000. Later after climbing another hill then slowing
for a stop sign, it happened again. Both times I checked the oil level (I
had just added a half quart before we left the house). The dipstick was
not too hot (I could touch it bear handed), the oil on the dipstick was
not foaming and I could hold my hand almost on the crankcase, so it was
not overheated. Waited a few minutes, then proceeded with out trip, but
skipped the off-roading and came home (total trip was over a hundred
miles, no more problems. I'm thinking maybe a bad oil filter (fram) or a
bad sending unit. The filter has been on for 3000 miles and would have
been changed today if we hadn't decided to go on this trip. I have never
had a problem with Fram, but I know others have. Engine has over 185k and
was overhauled at 157k. Any advice or comments would be appreciated.
