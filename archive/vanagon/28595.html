Hi Pattie.  Yes, in Canada, these were available.  There's a 
few in the Vancouver area alone.

Harry.

&gt; A few years ago I saw an ad for a Synchro Crew Cab pickup and wondered if
&gt; anyone else has heard of this and if it was ever imported into the U.S.  I
&gt; think the ad appeared in a Northern California nickel want ad type
&gt; publication.
