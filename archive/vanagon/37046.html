Um.....isn't GREEN antifreeze a no-no?  Just wondering because I just 
spent all day yesterday trying rid my Westy of it...replaced it with 
yellow:)

&gt; Well I returned home today from a short business trip to find a letter 
&gt; from my VW dealership.  Seems the 2 year extended warranty I purchased 
&gt; from them was declined by the underwriters of the warranty company.  
&gt; Something about the age of the vehicle.  (1984 Westy)  So feeling a bit 
&gt; like cleaning I walk out to the garage to find what at first seemed to 
&gt; be a puddle from the recent rains.   Hmmmm......must be raining green 
&gt; antifreeze......!   You guessed it.   Looks like antifreeze coming from 
&gt; the right head gasket.   Oh well.....    Anyone know the name of a good 
&gt; mechanic in the sacramento area?   I'd like to donate some money to them 
&gt; in return for a van that doesn't leave puddles in my garage.

&gt; As for the extended warranty....   Has anyone else experienced something 
&gt; like this?
