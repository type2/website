It has the advantage of being near the Shelburne Museum, which is really a
'museum of museums'.  For my $.02, one of the world's wonders.  It had the
disadvantage, when I was at Button Bay, of having a large supply of
mosquitos, who easily and eagerly found the small tear in my tent door, and
supplied us with a family story that gets told and retold.  Jim McCarthy
