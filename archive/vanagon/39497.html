  I explained this to the guys in the shop
and they were not pleased and would not replace the strut.  They said it
was &quot;obvious&quot; that if one did not work it put more strain on the other.  
______________________________________________________________
The bottom line in strut construction or performance is &quot;force&quot;....the strut 
is designed to require a certain &quot;force&quot; to compress (or extend).  The strut 
is selected by the rear gate designer based upon the lifting points (where 
the strut attaches) and the weight of the gate.   Most struts for which I 
have seen design manuals for show standard extension forces of 20, 30, 60, 
90, and 120 lbs.

The strut cannot exert more force then it can exert. (!)  See above for some 
nominal values.  The strut can be tested using a scale and trying to force 
the strut closed against the scale.  It either works or it does not.  Maybe 
you got the wrong force strut somehow; maybe the force is just plain 
off...._dot_defective, in other words.  This has nothing to do with any guaranty 
or warranty; it has to do with the sellers obligation to provide a product 
that is useful for its intended purpose.

Gas struts are selected by extension force and 2 lengths; open length and 
closed length.  Any differences in the closed length might damage the guts 
of the strut, but I would imagine that would be sort of a catastrophic kinda 
thing, given the pressures of the gas inside the strut.

I mean, come on.  Even if you put only one strut on, what would happen?  You 
open the hatch, and it closes itself.  I can see of no way that selling two 
struts does anything except line the jobbers pocket.

Backup plan:  did you pay by check, or credit card?
