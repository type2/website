Hi Everybody,

First off I'd like to apologize to Gerry and other
members of this far flung list for cluttering it up
with this note.  However, since I want the bus to go
to an appreciative home...  This, to me, is the place
to start.

It is with much sadness and regret that I'm offering 
&quot;The Beast&quot; for sale.  It is an oxidised red with only
a few areas still having a bit of surface rust.  It has
a new windshield, new muffler, new tires, new clutch cable.
Compression is 140 psi on all cylinders.  We also have all service
 records
of its stay with us.  The heating (ha) system needs work and 
I suspect that it needs a new oil cooler as its eating a
half litre of oil per 500miles.  Also since the ignition
switch gave up the ghost we bypassed it with a marine
push button.  
Why am I selling it?  Because I'm going to college for
computer science and I need more power than the old
286/12 affords me.  So, anyone in the Ottawa valley (Canada)
who is interested can contact me at: (613) 230-3921.  I want
to get $3000cdn for it and I'm going to be fairly firm with
that price.  
Also anyone interested can e-mail me for additional details.
Thanks for wading through this posting.  --Ralf
