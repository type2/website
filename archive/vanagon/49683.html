Subject: Re: Mystery module. what the heck is it? '72

Help, anybody?? This thread is from the Vanagon list. It is in regards to the
vacuum advance cutoff switch mounted above the engine with the heater blower on
1972, 73 and auto trans 74 carbureted vans.

Ed, now you know as much as I do about it. The only reference I can find to it
in the Bently is in section 5, page 9, a diagram showing the location and what
it is. The connector hanging near it plugs into it. Where the vacuum lines run
is a mystery, but knowing what the device is I must assume that it one hose
connects to the distributor (the advance side, not the retard side) and the
other connects to the vacuum port on the carb (where the distributor advance
hose is hooked up now). I am currently using a Bosch 050 distributor (mech.
advance) and a pair of Dellorto carbs, and the van had a single Weber and an 009
when I got it, so I have never actually seen this cutoff switch hooked up. It
also saw limited use in production (1972, 1973 and auto trans 1974). I recently
purchased the stock distributor and as soon as I finish rebuilding the stock
carbs I will be installing them, so I too will need to know where it all hooks
up. I'll keep in touch. I am also forewarding this to the Type II list, as that
is where most of the airheads reside, in hopes of more assistance.


&gt;Andy;
&gt;I do have a '72 and the stock distributor and carbs. (actually, the carbs 
&gt;are a little newer but the part numbers are the same.)  If you know how 
&gt;to hook it up I would really apreciate some instruction.  
&gt;thanks.
&gt;Ed.

&gt;&gt; It's a vacuum advance cutoff switch. If you don't have the stock carbs and
&gt;&gt; distributor, it's useless. As with all emissions equipment, save it. You'll
need
&gt;&gt; it eventually.
