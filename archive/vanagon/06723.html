Oh Barney...
One thing I failed to mention in my instructions...
When you take the plastic away from around the steering column,  you may want
to unscrew the screws for the fuse panel as well so you have that much 
more fiddling around room.

Best of luck...  The whole thing is easier if you have either a helper 
or 8 foot long arms with multiple elbows.   :)
