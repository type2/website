Subject: Re: Long range fuel tank for vanagon?

I sense a project coming on here :-) 

Having just crawled underneath the 'company' synchro parked opposite
my Westy it looks like the Synchro tank sits over the gearbox
instead of behind the front axle (obvious, really, when you think
about it - which I didn't!).  Its 5am on the night shift here &amp;
raining so details were hard to make out!  Thoughts on obtaining the
synchro tank/filler/plumbing and using them in addition to the
existing set up?!  

Let's see:  control valves, cut out for the filler, ring 'round all 
the breakers..........

..or am I missing something?

Thanks for the prompt, Jon.

Rich Lumb,

&gt; could you possibly adapt the rear-mounted Syncro fuel tank?
