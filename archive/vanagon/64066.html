Greetings and salutations:
Has anyone tried this. From what I have read , it sounds ideal for
Vanagons. The piston head (or crown) is coated with a layer of ceramic.
This forms a heat barrier which has two advantages.  There is less heat
to be dissipated by the piston skirt/ oil/ cooling system. This heat is
reflected into the combustion chamber and produces more useful work.
Cooler running and more power! The ole 1.9L could sure use that. Where do
I sign up and how much?
Good Luck &amp; Drive Safely
