Hi, geek here, speeking mechanical/corrosion engineer speek at you......

I don't think the number of reports of coolant into the cyls. or comb. 
gasses into coolant is anywhere near as high as leaks past the thick rubber 
head gasket to the outside.  The cyl barrel is tightly clamped down by the 
head and a thin hard gasket.  This is a 'good' joint as far as resisting 
corrosion.  The long head bolts, the head and the block effectively make a 
vice that clamps the barrels under considerable load. Seepage is minimal, 
and the preloading is quite high, this prevents cyclic fatigue from cracking 
the head bolts and is why proper assembly and retorqueing is good practice. 
Prevents thread fatigue.

The aluminium water jacket is not clamped tightly however!!  The fat rubber 
gasket is there to allow different (ie. greater) expansion of the jacket 
when the engine heats up, the growth of alum. being near 4 times that of 
steel over the same length and temperature change. 

When cold the jacket contracts, unloading the sealing force on the rubber 
gaskets.  Wasserboxer owners have reported spontaneous leaks with no prior 
history when temps. dropped to say -25F.  Old hardened gaskets simply can't 
expand enough to maintain tight sealing as the engine cools.

The presence of thick soft gaskets in a system subject to a corrosive 
environment is a definate NO-GO in corrosion engineering.  It leads to a 
unique form of (high-speed) corrosion know as &quot;crevice corrosion&quot;  Small 
crevices are created by the pressure of the coolant in forcing itself UNDER 
the edges of the soft gasket, and being trapped in small pockets.  These 
trapped pockets exhibit accelerated corrosion due to variation in 
electrolyte ion concentrations within the pocket, thus the stagnant coolant 
sets up a miniature corrosion cell whose electrical driving force is due to 
the change in ion concentration, not to the presence of a second metal. Also 
O2 gradients get set up, with the dissolved O2 near the metal surface being 
at a lower concentration than up by the rubber side. Yup we're talking 
microscopic action here.  The outcome is the pitting of the heads which is 
when all this corrosion becomes noticeable.

The reason for our wasserboxers leaky head probs is that the engine was 
built as an aircooled engine with water jackets added. It was not built from 
its inception to be a water cooled engine. The logic in the design is good 
from a mechanical engineering designers position, likely who VAG had doing 
the work, but they didn't consult with a corrosion engineer.  They obviously 
have since the problems came up as the newest replacement heads are cadmium 
plated (gold-bronzish) which is a surface treatment that will SLOW the rate 
of corrosion.  Crevice corrosion mechanism will still exist.  Frequent 
changing of the coolant will put fresh corrosion inhibitors into the system, 
slowing the process also.

The bottom line here is that the corrosion is not due to dissimilar metals 
but to the geometry and components of the design.  Switching to a nickel or 
chrome plated aluminium cylinder barrel with the same coefficient of thermal 
expansion as the water jackets may help by allowing the use of stiff 
uncompressible gaskets under high compression loads. But engine assembly, 
deck heights and head bolt torques would become more critical/fiddly.

Another option was that a slip joint should have been designed, exactly like 
the pushrod tubes in the pancake motors. Here the different thermal growth 
rates are accommodated by the end of the O-ringed tube sliding against the 
smooth bores in the block or head. Hey they don't leak do they?:) Same idea 
could be applied to the vanagons, but would've meant major head retooling 
and a wierd shaped &quot;O-ring&quot; to wrap around the outside of the jackets and 
slide withing a deep grove in the heads.  May not provide good enough seal 
to prevent seepage of 15psi water however.  So... Live with it is the 
solution, or go alternative engine. 

&gt;
&gt;So... you could get rid of the problem by 'aluminizing' the Cylinders on
&gt;the outside and using an aluminum gasket material??? or maybe just a
&gt;coat of paint would do it.
&gt;
Nope, wrong problem.

geek speek? :OFF,
