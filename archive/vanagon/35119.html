&gt;Hi Pat,
&gt;Are you still in charge of the Bus/Vanagon literature data base? The last 
&gt;copy I have is dated 03-10-95. I had some recent requests for copies of the 
&gt;BN2 gas heater manuals I own. So if that data base is still active, could 
&gt;you add the following:
&gt;I have and I'm willing to make copies of:
&gt;
&gt;1. Technical description and installation instructions for the BN2 
&gt;Eberspaecher gas heater
&gt;
&gt;2. Troubleshooting and repair manual for the BN2 Eberspaecher gas heater
&gt;
&gt;I have the two of them in german, english, swedish and french
&gt;
&gt;3. Installation guidelines for the Eberspaecher B3L/D3L gas heater in 
&gt;VW-bus type 2-model 25
&gt;
&gt;This one I have in german only, but I could translate it easily.
&gt;
&gt;If you have a more recent version of that data base, please forward it to me.
&gt;Thanks for your help.
&gt;
Damn your memory, Stefan!  I was hoping if I kept quiet people would forget
about that!  :-)  Nah, I'd just kind let it slide because I didn't know if
people were interested in it or not and I didn't want to keep posting it
to the list every month if no one really cared.  But I've still got the last
one I posted, and I think I've got a couple of corrections that people sent
in.  I'll add your stuff and try to make the corrections and post it later
on in the week.
