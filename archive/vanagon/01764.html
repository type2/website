Subject: Re: Bike Rack for a Bus


Speaking of bike racks...I have a 4 bike rack that attaches to a trailer
hitch receiver, BUT I haven't found a trailer hitch WITH receiver that 
works with our '90/1 Carat.

I saw a receiver equipped hitch on a ~89 Vanagon in a parking lot that 
looked like it was bolted to the tow-eyes of the rear bumper attachment.

Anyone have more clues on locating this particular hitch?

BTW: my bike rack works wonderfully attached to my Villager's receiver...
