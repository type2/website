Sorry if this just got posted a while ago but I lost contact with the
list some how.  I also remembered that the interiors will not be
compatible.  mine is a sportsmobile and the other sounds like a
standard.  Did '73s have the high backed seats?

here is the original incase it didn't make it to the list.
