&gt;BUS BOYS did just that!!

&gt;In early July I ordered VDO gauges from BusBoys.
&gt;They said they were on back order.  I said ok.
&gt;They call me two weeks later to tell me they can't
&gt;get what I wanted.  I SPECIFICALLY stated that I 
&gt;wanted to get them all from the same source.
&gt;I SPECIFICALLY stated that I wanted to CANCEL
&gt;my order.  The guy on the phone said OK. DONE.
&gt;Handled, no problem, ORDER CANCELLED!!!
&gt;
&gt;That was over two weeks ago.
&gt;
&gt;I called the bank today to check my balance-
&gt;OVERDRAWN- WHAT!?!?!?!  I check the detailed
&gt;debits/credits there is a charge for $211.06.
&gt;I'm at loss- so I call the bank to inquire.
&gt;They look it up and say 'yes- that came from
&gt;a place called Bus Boys.'  I tell her the story,
&gt;she tells me to call them then call her back.
&gt;I call them, damn machine!

Rob,

I just reached Bus Boys on the phone, and asked them to get onto the list
and post an explanation (from their point of view) of what happened and
what they're doing to provide you with customer satisfaction.

In my humble opinion, I can easily see how this could have been a
misunderstanding, but Bus Boys should solve this problem (and save their
reputation) by Federal Expressing you a money order.

Please keep me appraised of what happens.  If they don't make a fair effort
to solve your situation, then I will remove them from my 'Vendors' list.  I
don't wish to list anyone who treats their customers badly.
