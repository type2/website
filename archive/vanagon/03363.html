&gt; My 83 has chrome bumpers,cloth seats, carpeting, but no pinstripe.
&gt; i have a semi-hard black plastic shift knob - oh yeah and five speeds
&gt; too!!  anyone else out there have a five speed or should i push this
&gt; into a barn to appreciate .....just kidding .....

I was reading an old Consumer Reports magazine where they were
talking about all the problems that the 5-speed had. They said
most of the problems started just after the BACK-UP lights fail!!  ;-)
                                       (just kidding around)

My '82 bunker-burner has all of the above except the 5 speed.  When
I drive along at 60, that engine is screaming! I would *really* 
rather have the 5 speed...

I sent my wife and kids off to Darien Lake today in NuBus. I fixed all
the leaks, and it is running super. Darien lake is about 100 Miles
away { thats 120 miles Canadian :-) } so I hope she makes it. (Since I
haven't gotten a call, I suppose she did. Now will she make it BACk?)

So Steve, *My* oiler has only 4 speeds, but the backup lights work!

I *love* pulling up to a full-serve Diesel pump. Nobody truly believes 
its a diesel, and I have to *ask* them to pump it. I get this 
&quot;Can't you read?... this is the _diesel_ pump&quot; look.
