&gt;I need to replace everything.  Front, back, connector, catalytic, muffler 
&gt;and pipe.  I've priced the dealer and would rather buy a nice used car.  
&gt;I've checked the Parts Place in MI and still find them high (plus have heard

&gt;one bad story about their exhaust components).  Now I'm thinking of having a

&gt;muffler/exhaust shop be creative and just put to-gether some pipes hook it 
&gt;all together and see if it works.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody with a more solid solution?

Buy the correct parts and do it right.  Will probably be last exhaust you'll
have to buy.  Walker CAT #15612 will work great for $150.  The DANSK exhaust
pipes and BOSAL muffler is good combination.  Make suer all the brackets are
there so the pipes do not crack.
