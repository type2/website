Subject: Re: First timer needs advice...

&gt;I'm currently in search of my first vanagon and have my mind set on a
&gt;syncro.  Is this a wise choice - or should I stick with the 2wd variety.
&gt;Reading all the postings regarding syncros, I've begun to think
&gt;twice...not so much about purchase price but about the associated costs
&gt;down the road.  I do not travel off road that often but the security of
&gt;awd/4wd is comforting.  My Cherokee died recently and my Jetta is not
&gt;cutting the mustard.  Some friendly advice on the matter is appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;thanks

I don't have a Syncro, but I do have a Honda Civic wagon with a similar 4
wheel system and I REALLY like it.  When the rain is coming down I can
actually feel it kick in.  I think it's paid for itself in terms of added
traction--and that's in Texas!  If I lived anywhere where there was much
ice and snow, I KNOW I'd always want to have it.  I don't know about VW,
but the Honda version has never required any work or repair and I'm about
to hit 160,000 miles.

If I could afford it, I probably would have hunted for a Syncro, too.
