&gt;Bill can drive in front of me anytime he wants when I cross the Golden

    When I flew down to San Jose to pick the Convertible Ghia I bought, I
    drove over the Golden Gate and didn't have to pay.  It was a Saturday.
    This is weekday only thing?

    BTW, it was a gorgeous, warm, clear day with the top down and the bridge
    towering above us.  Really great drive.
