Subject: Re: Cooling Intake Air?

Seems to me the warmer the incoming air, the less dense it is, hence
would have less oxygen per unit volume....  I cannot see how this would
help.  Sounds like it would hurt things more.  BTW, as I understand it,
this is what the &quot;intercooler&quot; in the intercooled turbo-charging
units do -- cool the air being pumped into the cylinders.

About the only place cool air into the cylinders is bad is airplanes --
freezes the carburator too, I heard...

Cooling the incoming air sounds like a good idea, at least in theory.
whether one can actually cool it enough to make a difference and not hurt
the air flow _around_ the engine is questionable...

&gt;air tends to absorb aersolized gasoline (such as that coming out of your
&gt;injectors or down in your carb) much more rapidly, efficiently and
&gt;completely, thus giving a more combustible air/fuel mix.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, this is just slightly informed speculation on my part...
