Subject: Stainless Steel Exhaust Systems



STEBRO is the originator of performance exhaust systems for imports,
its distinctive &quot;bug&quot; trademark has been around since 1956. They
manufacture exhaust systems for all kinds of cars, foreign and domestic
and even Postal Service trucks. STEBRO offer engineered, quality stainless
steel exhaust systems and tips for a wide variety of automobiles, past
and present models.

At present they show no Vanagon exhaust systems on the web, but one of the
Canadian should call or mail and ask for detailed information. We are all
very interested.
