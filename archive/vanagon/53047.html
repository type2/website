If you flip through the JCW catalog a add up all the 10%, 20% 30%!!! fuel
savers they push, it's a wonder we're not all getting a hundred miles per
gallon!!!

What _I_ really like are all the &quot;mechanic-in-a-can&quot; pitches.  I'll never
have to do another ring or valve job in my life!!!!

On a personal note, a looooong time ago (like when I was in high school) when
I was working on my bug-eye sprite, I got a JCW catalog, and it was *Full*
of snake-oil pitches like these...(and the water pump I ordered for my sprite
was so bad I couldn't believe it was designed for my car)....SAVE YOUR MONEY!
