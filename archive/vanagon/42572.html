&gt; &gt;That be your cooling fan.  Runs when it's warm whether you are using the
&gt; &gt;fridge or not.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; It should not run unless the fridge is running or the van gets really hot
&gt; inside.  Serves no purposeif fridge not on.  Possible bad switch.  

Mine has always done this from day one.  I've never had a problem with
the fridge on any of the power sources.  On mild to warm days (no rain
in forcast) I always pop open the sunroof and during the real hot spells,
I'll even close all the curtains and crack a few windows.
