Subject: Extra Gas?


I was wondering if it is safe to carry an extra gallon of gas in a gas 
canaster inside my 1980 camper.  I'm sure some people do it.  Could you 
put the canaster in one of the cabinets?  (since my gas meter is broke, I 
have to judge the level on milage)

Any advice would be great.
