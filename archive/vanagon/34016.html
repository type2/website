Subject: typing 2 ink (obr)

just been reading my obr and can solve the mystery of the panel van cargo
door handle!  hi jim!   couldnt resist saying my bit, as I like fiddling with
locks and sorting out the system 50-67 in my head and on buses.

As they were expected to carry cargo, not people, there was no reason to have
an inside handle on the cargo door.   It would just catch up on stuff.  So
the panel van handle have a shorter square shaft.

67 cargo door handles are a one year only.   They are made for the L series
key which was used in 67 - 70 in buses. also 67 in bugs,?68.   69 bug takes a
K series key. earlier bugs take SC or SU keys (60sbugs)
 
the L key is longer that the previous keys.   So the lock cyinder in longer
(has more pins), which weakens the cargo door handle.  Most 67s handles were
broken and replaced.  If i see a split with a broken handle, its always a 67.
  Bad design.  Hard to find one, if you want one key for your 67 bus.  Also,
67 was the year when the steering lock came with an L key - one key for whole
car!  Earlier steering locks used their own key.

64-66 buses used T series keys.  These handles have the keyway door.  T keys
have a little bump on one side at the end it goes on yout keychain.
54-63 they used a series that had many letters to it.  no keyway door
in 59 they put an indentation in the cargo so you dont bust your knuckles
turning the handle. (previous doors were flat)  At the same time the handle
was lengthened.
though barndoor cargo door locks are in the door mechanism and activated from
the outside, not in the handle,  the 54-55s do use the same key profile as
buses to 63.

it is not possible to change cylinders to handles made to take a different
cylinder.

The square lock pins moved by the lock came in dealer replacement handles.
 Ones sold w/ the car have round pins.

Im not sure when they put the lock on the door mechanism with the lever on
the inside.  I think around 63.  earlier ones  didnt have it.  

I never had a problem with the crew coming out and the handle shaking loose.
  I have had a problem with  the screw breaking off in the handle.   Either
way the handle's uselessor gone. yurk

btw, all handles somewhere one them have the key code.  It is possible to
have a new key cut for your handle, if you can find a locksmith witth the
blanks and the codes.  I just had a pair of new T keys cut for a 66 camper,
cost me $15 plus tax.  Keys worked in all the handles except the cargo door
handle, in which to my surprise the end of the cylinder was broken off, so i
transferred the pins over into a cylinder off a spare handle and installed
it.  Happy locks.

my  2 cents.
