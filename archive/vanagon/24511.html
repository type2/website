Subject: can green coolant be phosphate-free?
Date: Mon, 11 Sep 1995 00:09:03 -0500 (CDT)

Dear Waterboxers,

I noticed that a friend's newly purchased '84 Westy has green coolant and
suggested he had the dealer (from whom he just got it) replace it with the
blue stuff. Even gave the friend this list's FAQ pertaining to the issue,
which he, in turn, showed to the dealer. Well, the dealer claims that this
particular green coolant is actually correct, having been ok'ed by VW. 

True or bull?
