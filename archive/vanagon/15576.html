Subject: Re: Shift rod accessory

        Dear David:
        
        Correct-a-mundo about the shift length.  What I should have said 
        more accurately was that it makes shifting easier because the 
        adaptor screws into the top of the shifter and is easier to grasp 
        and move.  It does not make it shorter, only easier.  I am no 
        longer &quot;slope-shouldered&quot; from leaning rightward as I shift.  The 
        shifting is easier, not shorter.  That change would probably 
        require the very expensive Berg shift kit.
        
        BTW, I am presently &quot;shiftless&quot; as one of the heads in my beloved 
        bus has cracked.  I know what I will be doing over spring break 
        but not exactly how much I will have to spend, at least not yet.  
        As if that wasn't enough, a young kid slid into the back of our 
        new E-Van last Tuesday and the idiots at her insurance company 
        are trying to give me grief about a settlement.  The kid actually 
        asked the cop who was at fault.
        
        And so it goes,
