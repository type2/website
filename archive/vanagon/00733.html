Subject: small part, BIG BUCKS!


On my '78 bus there's a fan over the motor, in the engine compartment that
is used for the heater.  THis is controlled by a little box on it, that
has 5 or 6 leads, and a little plastic harness plugs onto it with all the
wires on the harness.  Well, I think it's broken (actually pretty darn
sure), but the local VW dealer wants over $60 Canadian for the part, and
no one else in the city has it.  Help, does anyone have a spare one they'd
sell?
There's a few numbers on it (part numbers?) one of them is &quot;211963141A&quot;, 
and there are 5 connections, labled:  J,B,A,M,31.  And another number:
&quot;R601.108&quot;.
I don't really need a heater, but if I could get the part cheap enough I
would like to get it. 
			Thanks,  DAN.
