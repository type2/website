Subject: steering, swing lever

I'm about to install a new swing lever shaft and bushings in my '65
transported. I'd like to do this with the swing lever still installed.  To
do this I need to ream the bushings to the correct size prior to pressing
them in.  Brookland's give 0.9449 to 0.9457 in (24 mm?) as specs for the 
diameter.  My buddy is going to bore the bushings for me on his lathe to
0.946 to accomodate the compression of the bushings after installation.  My 
question is does anyone have an idea how much compression the bushings 
undergo after pressing them in.  What diameter should the bushings be bored
to prior to pressing them in.  The other option is to press them in after
they've been bored conservatively, buy a 24mm ream and hand ream them after
they have been pressed in.  Any insight would be appreaciated.
