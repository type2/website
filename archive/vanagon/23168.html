Subject:       head removal


&gt; 	 Well we got the first head off no problem 
&gt; and saw that yes indeed, there was a cracked valve seat.  However the 
&gt; second head seems stubbornly attached to the the cylinders and we even 
&gt; broke off a few cooling fins trying to tap the head off.  It is now 
&gt; soaking in WD40 and i will try again later today.  Are there any other 
&gt; suggestions about how to separate the two??

this is a wild hair idea-- i don't know the air-cooled engines and 
i've never tried this (full disclaimers) but...

could one lower the piston to bottom dead center, stuff a nylon rope 
in thru the spark plug hole and crank the engine??  wouldn't this pop 
the head off?  or would it blow out the crank/rod/whatever?

guffaws welcome (and anticipated)
