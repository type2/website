&gt;I was driving home the other night when I hit a rather small pothole,
&gt;nothing to be concerned about, when I heard a terrible noise and the front
&gt;end of my 78 started to pull. I got out and looked underneath and realized
&gt;that the support on the drivers side of the front axle beam was totally
&gt;rusted out and had broke. :-( I was wondering what year(s) front beam will
&gt;fit my bus. I am going to start combing the junkyards on payday. Any info
&gt;would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I beleive 73+ uses same beam.
