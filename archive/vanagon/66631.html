Subject:      EV pictures wanted?

For a limited time until 31. Oct. 97 Motor-Sport-Presse
offers 3000 pictures of available vehicles in Europe.
You may select a Brand and you get a gallery of
available pics which can be expanded. I found a
hand full of EVs out of 70 different VW vehicles. But test
yourself at:

If you're asked for USER name and Password,
type the three letters mpo for both of them. Download
is limited to 10 expanded pictures a day.

Enjoy
Helmut
