Subject: Re: Smell from heater

If the heater smell like waffles, you have a leaky  heater core.  I was told
that they cannot be repaired, and a new one is expensive, especially if the
flow valve and the core are bad (about $175 from VW for rear).

It's easy to pull and examine the rear (I have not done the front).If you see
a lot of junk in the fins, I think it's time for a new one.  I had mine
pressure tested at a local radiator shop,for $5 and it showed a leak where
the plactic meets the metal.  I pulled one from a junkyard that looked clean,
but it also leaked. I guess I'll bite the big one and get a new one from VW.

You could luck out if the leak is coming at the joint between valve and  the
core: a new gaslet is only a couple of bucks.  Right now I have put a clamp
on both hoses to stop all coolant flow to the rear heater for the summer.
 Assuming I still have the bus when the cold arrives, I will replace it then.

Corroded heater core might indicate other corroded parts in the cooling
system.  Have the system flushed and replaced with VW coolant as soon as you
can.  If you are smelling coolant, you are losing coolant.  Fix it. Watch
your temp guage.  Don't overheat the beast.

As far as parts for an 880 mile trip. I would say have anything that is wrong
fixed first, if you can.  I don't see the point in hauling around an auto
parts store everywhere you go.
