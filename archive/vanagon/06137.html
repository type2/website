&gt;I need to replace the muffler on my 71 bus and was just about 
&gt;sold on the 'Monza'/4-tip job advertised everywhere ($40-$70).  

AAaaaargh! I paid $105 at the Bus Boys.

&gt;It had the cleanest looking pipe arrangement, for one thing.  
&gt;However, salesman at local VW place pooh-poohed the system (at 
&gt;least he was honest).
&gt;
&gt;Any good muffler experiences out there?

Don't get the ones from the Bus Boys. They had cheap, non-heat resistant
paint, which smelled awful and burned away, letting the muffler be
covered with rust within a week. 

They are not legal in California, at least not on my fuel injected, EGR
equipped, 75 bus.

It's sometimes painful to work on your engine, 'cause those 4 protruding
tips are HOT!

There is a bump in my bumper and so the muffler almost touches it: at low
idle, it vibrated against the bumper, which makes a lot of noise.
