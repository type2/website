Subject: Re: Cargo Hauls 

Hi All,

Seeing all these 'Cargo Haul' posts reminded me of a memorable haul about 
8 years ago.  I was cleaning out the basement of a house to make room for 
storing VW parts and something needed to be done with all the colored 
glass that was being saved for future recycling--no one at that time took 
colored glass.

Well, the majority of the colored glass was a vast collection of large 
wine bottles.  My 67 Deluxe Sunroof had the middle and rear seats 
temporarily removed, so I filled the cargo area *very* carefully with the 
mostly one gallon bottles all the way past the beltline up into the area 
of the side windows.  This process was done by lowering many of the 
bottles thru the sunroof (luckily I am a tall person!).

The 25 mile drive to the landfill was done very carefully and none of the 
bottles were broken.  I spent about 40 minutes tossing the bottles into 
the trash heaps, smashing the bottles to bits.  It reminded of the song 
'I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass'.  The trashmen there said it looked 
like there was quite a party!!
