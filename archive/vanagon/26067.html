&gt;Note that USAA is only open to Active, Retired, and /or former Officers of the
&gt;United States Armed Forces. 

And their families, descendants, sons-in-law,...

&gt;have been very satisfied with their service, and believe that their rates are
&gt;&quot;as good as it gets&quot;.

We often get those &quot;courtesy&quot; calls from other insurance or credit card
companies with &quot;fabulous&quot; introductory rates &quot;until 1997!&quot;. They give up
when we mention USAA.
