Subject: Cartalk's VW puzzler

I know its not Friday, but this would be really stale by then.  Did
anyone catch Cartalk this weekend?  Their puzzler was as follows:

&quot;Larry's VW Beetle he had in college caught on fire when he and 3 of his
friends piled in the car for a night on the town. The mishap had to do
with a repair he'd done 6 weeks earlier when he loosened 3 screws and
tightened 3 bolts. What was the repair? Why did the car catch fire?&quot;

(You can e-mail an answer to them at puzzler_at_cartalk_dot_com if you want)
