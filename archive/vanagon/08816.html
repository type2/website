Subject: Re: R&amp;T Digression




Jim's points are well taken. My admission of stereotyping those who do not
wear seat belts etc. reflects the fact that I have to &quot;interact&quot; with
strangers when I get into a car and drive on public roads. I can't get out
and explain to the transgressors why I think they should change their
habits, so I am left to fume in my little white vanagon - frustration
leading to generalisations?
