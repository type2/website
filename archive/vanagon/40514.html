Subject:       Re: Restoration business in Memphis, lets buy it!

&gt; That way, we could have a home base/shrine for vanagon_at_lenti people!  We
&gt; could have yearly pilgrimages there!  It could be a co-op for list members
&gt; where we could send our busses to be restored at a discount!

Hehehe! 

Said to wife: &quot;Hey honey, the bus needs a tune-up.  I can get it 
for free at our dealership.  I'll see ya in a couple weeks!!!&quot;

 
&gt; I think Joel should be in charge of this venture.

Seconded.
 
&gt; Hmmm, next I say we buy 50 acres of land in Colorado .......

Better yet a compound in Montana by the Freeman.  We could call 
ourselves the Veemen!

The government would surround us and start playing Greatful dead at 
105db to get us to come out.  The wouldn't realize that they are 
actually making out stay more enjoyable...
