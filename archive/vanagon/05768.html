Subject: RE: Dealer offers 10K for 91 Carat with 11.8K book value....is it a rip....

This is how dealers work.  I just helped my SO haggle with a dealer.  
They wanted to give her $1200 dollars for her 88 Ford Tempo that blue 
books between $2600 and $3700.  They say there is not a market to make 
you feel like they are giving you a deal.  They are just trying to earn 
a living, and are trying to make the largest profit possible.

Rule number 1:
The car you are looking at is not the only vehicle in the world.  
Manufacturers make thousands of cars, if you ever feel unsure, back 
yourself out of there, and think about it.  The salesman are not going 
to try and let you leave without a vehicle(ie. they'll keep trying to 
haggle and sell), cause they know that if you leave, they are missing 
an opportunity to make a sell.


Rule number 2:
Stick to your guns.  If you know the bluebook value of your vehicle, 
know what you want as far as price goes.  Aim high, and then be willing 
to come down a bit as they are going to shoot low.  Also, spend the 
time at the local library looking into the vehicle you plan on buying.  
Know the dealers cost on the vehicle, and what you are willing to pay.  
If anything seems awry, see rule number 1. =)

I think we ended up with a fair deal.  $500 dollars over dealer 
invoice(not the stuff they hang in the window of the vehicle), with a 
$2400 dollar trade in.  But mind you it did take us 3 days of talking 
and haggling, and a couple walk outs.

Good luck

Jon
