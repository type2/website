I just bought an 80 vanagon and need to put oil in it, so which oil do
I use.  Also does the stick trans take fluid, if so where's the
dipstick?  I'm having a problem getting the car into first on a dead
stop, on a hill and the E break isn't holding the van-any suggestions to
these problems would be a great help!
