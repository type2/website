Wasserboxer Owners:

I was removing my muffler (the end pipe was just haning there)
and discoverd that my catalytic convert was hollow, zippo,
nothing inside at all. No wonder it failed PA emissions last April.
Anyway, I did some shopping and came up with the following prices.

          Dealer  EuroParts  PartsPlace
muffler    $386     $179       $199
cat        $166     $275       $149

What a price range! So I'm getting the muffler from EuroParts and
the cat from PartPlace, it pays to shop around.
