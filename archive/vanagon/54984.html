&gt; &gt; My front fan control switch in my newly purchased 85 westy is jammed in

&gt; &gt; switch the fan would come once in a while. The heat and defrost is fairly
&gt; &gt; ineefective without the fan  specially in this frosty part of NH.
&gt; &gt; Anyadvice would be appreciated.

check the relay in the left side wall of the trunk/reAR

&gt; I'm almost positive this is the same switch used ever since the early
&gt; Rabbits, Sciroccos &amp; Jettas. I've replace two of them over the years
&gt; ('77 Rabbit &amp; '82 Scirocco) for less than $15 at my FLAPS. One had
&gt; flaky connections due to corrosion, the other jammed exactly like you
&gt; described. (Actually, it melted). You may want to check the wiring
&gt; while you're in there, and avoid running on &quot;3&quot; with the new switch
&gt; until the reason for meltdown is discovered.
&gt; The switch works great in my '88, but the fan is not so great... :(
