Subject: Blowing Coolant Hoses Right and Left

My '87 Vanagon has blown 5, yes 5 different coolant hoses since last Labor
Day. I have spewed coolant (the good stuff) all over the state of Indiana.
Is it just me? Is it the fact that the van is now 8 years old and they all
need to be replaced. Should I just go ahead and bite the bullet and replace
the rest (might have to get a 2nd mortgage on the house)? Are you guys
running in to this?
