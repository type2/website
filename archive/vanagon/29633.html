&gt;On thing wrong with the ad is that we all know that Squarebacks do not get
&gt;stuck in the snow

When they run!

Mine ('70, my first car ever, in meeneesoooota) often didn't. My complete
ignorance of things automotive at the time, didn't help.

It also got stuck in snow twice, 'till I replaced the (cheap, bald,
bias-ply) rear tires with snow tires. Then it was a little tractor.
