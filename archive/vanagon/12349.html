Subject: '87 Vanagon Radio ?
Date: Thu, 2 Mar 1995 07:10:01 -0500 (EST)

&gt; 
  I've got a problem with the security divice on my electronic radio cassette
&gt; in my '87 Vanagon.  It's the factory item.  The radio somehow came loose
&gt; in the dash mounting and the alarm went off.    Wether or not someone
&gt; tried to heist the unit is not clear.  My SO had the van and she called to
&gt; ask me what to do.  I told her leave it be and I'll look after it when you
&gt; get home.  Well, many hours later she arrives, it's late, dark and cold out
&gt; so I went in the van and removed the unit from the van and it's been
&gt; sitting on my desk now for two weeks.  Yesterday I had some spare time and
&gt; I went about putting it back.  Plugged in all the connectors, it beeped, I
&gt; pushed it into the dash and the clips locked in place but there was no &quot;code&quot;
&gt; message on the LCD screen.  I tried to enter my security code
&gt; anyways but it would not accept it.  I removed and reinstalled the unit
&gt; several times without success.  Finally in frustration I left the unit in
&gt; the dash and called the local VW shop.  They told me that perhaps the
&gt; security system has been damaged and it will cost about $85.00 to repair. 
&gt; Now ! my question is do any of you electronic &quot;experts&quot; out there have the
&gt; solution to this puzzel ?  Besides paying the $85.00  ):-)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; 
&gt; Frank
