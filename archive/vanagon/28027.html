Subject: re:  Free(?) VW History Book (sorry, all gone)


&gt;&gt;&gt;I called the vw ag #  (1-800-444-8987)  and they did indeed say they'd 
send
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;history book.   Also a video.   Also there is a commemorative piece of
&gt;&gt;&gt;artwork (subtle ad?)   showing  a split screen bus with a tear coming out 

&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;one headlight,  and 'Jerry Garcia,  1942-1995'.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;After seeing this post, I immediately called that 800 number, and spoke
&gt;&gt;to a lady named Rose. She said that the history book is no longer
&gt;
&gt;Now that's amazing!!!  I too called this morning and they were very glad to 

&gt;send it.  She asked where I got the 800 number and I told her on the
&gt;internet.  She said that they are getting lots of calls from that.  She is
&gt;also sending me the art pack that has the poster.  I can't believe they 
just
&gt;ran out.  You might try later.  Or, I think the original post from Ric 
Golen
&gt;gave a German address to write to for the book......


Well, I just tried again. Spoke to a man named Dean this time. Same
answer. I asked him how long it had been unavailable, and he said &quot;about
a month now&quot;.   ???

Anyone who gets the reply, &quot;Yes, we have them and will send you one&quot;,
PLEASE get the name of ther person you talked to, and post it! I'd love
to find out.

BTW, Dean also said I might try the Customer Service line, 1-800-822-8987.
He said &quot;They might still have some&quot;.
