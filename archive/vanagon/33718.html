Subject: FOR SALE 87 Vanagon GL (Sorry!)

If I've transgressed by offering, please forgive and delete! Otherwise,
your interest is appreciated.

Although I do love this vehicle, situation forces sale. This is a white GL
in really good condition, except for minor (?) coolant leaking at the
heads. I know there's been plenty of discussion on this problem and how
best to fix it, and since I don't want to wait until it warms up so I can
begin the process, I realize my expected financial compensation will be
reduced ($4500/BO.) Specifics below:

*  1987 VW Vanagon GL, four-headlight halogen system.
*  159K Miles
*  New windshield, pro install
*  New front rotors
*  New left front upper ball joint
*  New rear lid struts
*  New Hi/Lo lens/reflector assys (the large rectangular ones)
*  Bosch driving aux lights, relay/harness,switch on panel, linked to brites.
*  Good 70K-mi Michelins w/~20K on them
*  Sony stereo.
*  Excellent interior, exterior has one scrape on right side (oops!)

Vehicle has clear title, NY registration and inspection. Vehicle is located
in Western PA (Indiana, PA) an hour from Pittsburgh. Will consider delivery
(2-hr radius) as part of negotiation (not for examination).

Will consider as partial trade (up to $1000 value) late'70's 4WD full-size
PU (Chevy, GMC, Dodge, not Ford) or Toyota 4WD PU, manual transmission
only.

Contact:
      James Glenn (jmglenn_at_grove.iup_dot_edu)
      via direct e-mail (not the list, please spare the others!)
      telephone (412) 463-9045 after 6 p.m. weekdays, anytime weekends.
