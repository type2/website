My '71 bus has a bug muffler on it. It's a tight fit, but it fits...and 
replacements are cheap. Of course, this may be part of the reason I 
have a space between the muffler and heat exchanger pipes (closed with 
aluminum and clamps). Don't know if a bug muffler would fit in the 66. 8) Joe

&gt; They're really annoying, actually, as all you get is odors from the
&gt; engine compartment, but no useful heat.

&gt; 
&gt; It's a '66 bus, with a '71 engine.  The muffler is weird, in that the
&gt; flexible part of the heat riser tube is on the right instead of the
&gt; left.  The damper pipe is a simple L -- I didn't see an option for any
&gt; other type in the RMMW catalog, which is where I ordered my exhaust
&gt; system from.  It can't be pointed down, because it's completely inside
&gt; the body of the bumper (see side view below).
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have the tailpipe connected, as it would have to go through
&gt; the bumper mount.  I proved to myself last night that the exhaust I'm
&gt; smelling is definitely fresh exhaust being routed around to the air
&gt; intakes by the curve of the bumper.
&gt; 
&gt; For now, my plan is to live without a bumper.  For the longer term, I
&gt; plan on finding pictures appropriate to my model year, and figuring
&gt; out what the exhaust and bumper should look like.  I have no reason to
&gt; believe that the bumper is correct, either.
