Ahhh. That felt good just listening. I haven't lived THAT frustration 
yet, but I feel for you.

I think I made the right decision to NOT try to resto my '71 to original,
pristine condition. Rather, I'll stick to just chugging along on it,
making it better one small step at a time, never to show...never to show.

I'll save the Resto-frustration for a nice splitty (maybe a '60 panel or 
camper).

Thanks! Joe

&gt; NOT going to restore the bus etc.

&gt; This morning I stopped by the bodyshop where my bus is STILL sits unpainted
&gt; after eleven months....

heart of flame removed...
