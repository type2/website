&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Maybe someone out there has some advice.....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a '71 bus (with vacuum assisted brakes).  The bus idles fine, but when
&gt; &gt; I apply the brakes the idle becomes very rough and sometimes stalls.  This
&gt; This happened on my '71 when the master cylinder leaked through
&gt; the front and the brake fluid ate through the diaphragm on the
&gt; booster. Sounds like you need a new booster....sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; 
 I second Todd's diagnosis. The booster on my '72 also went bad. I'd 
 suggest finding out if the booster from a late breadloaf will fit. A junkyard
 booster may give years of good service at a fraction of the price of a new
 one.
