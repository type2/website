Subject: 911 in 69 westy


Can I put a V-6 Porche 911 engine in a 69 westy?
If I can does it require any adaptions?
If the engine is too big to fit in the standard engine compartment how 
hard would it be to cut some of the sheetmetal surrounding the engine away?
Also what are the pros and cons of putting the engine in?
