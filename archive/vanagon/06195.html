&gt;Speaking of Toyota, why can they make such a dang good car. 

     I used to own a Toyota Corolla and Tercel, 6 and 4 years each.
     As you have had, the only thing I did was changing oil. I sold
     them for a Volvo and a Vanagon. For the VW's 1st 3 years, I 
     replaced its headgasket, brake's master cylinder, brade pads,
     oxygen sensor, thermostat, etc... For the Volvo's 1st 4 years,
     I replaced its water pump, brake pads, heater blower fan, and
     needed to patch chipped paint, etc... Now, the VW is requiring
     another set of headgaskets (you know the ridiculous cost).

Regards,
James
