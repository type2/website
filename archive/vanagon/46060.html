Subject: Re: Nominations for 10 Best cars


This note is in response to your gathering votes/nominations for the 10
&quot;best&quot; cars for the 100th anniversary of the automobile.  In this
context, I will interprete &quot;best&quot; to be a measurement of contribution
to the automobile industry --either technically or in spreading the
use of the automobile as a means transportation worldwide.

Given this interpretation of the criteria, and the fact that I would
hate for this to turn into a &quot;Detroit horn-blowing session&quot;, I would
like to nominate the vehicle that has the following milestones under
its belt:

1)  Largest single model production of all time.
2)  Longest production run of all time [1946 to present]
3)  If those two are not enough, it is also the vehicle with the
    geographical distribution of any model of car; it can be found on
    every continent [save perhaps Antarctica] and in most countries.

By now, I am sure that you are aware that I am describing the
Volkswagen Beetle.  The Beetle gets my vote as the &quot;Best&quot; car of all
time. I would even place it ahead of the Ford Model-A in its
importance to the global success of the automobile; it is definitely
&quot;The Peoples Car&quot;. 


Two other highly influential Volkswagens are:

A) The Volkswagen Transporter [Micro Bus, Van, Vanagon].
Despite the overly advertised claims of Chrysler, this was the first
&quot;Mini-Van&quot;; and with much more character.

B) The Volkswagen Golf GTI (Mk I/II/III).  The Golf in general was a
very influential car and has a huge global presence.  The Golf GTI,
known as the Rabbit GTI in the US, was the original &quot;pocket rocket&quot;
sports hatchback and was the premier of its class.  So influential was
the GTI, that it spurred American and Japanese automakers to start
building their own sporty hatchbacks: Honda Civic Si, Plymouth
Horizon, Ford's pinto/bobcat.  Despite all the new competition, the
GTI is still best in its class.


Alas, ten is not a large number, and if no one is to feel left out,
then I can see that including all three VWs in the top ten may be a
source of some controversy.  The Beetle is a given as number one, feel
free to pick either of the Transporter or Golf for inclusion in the
top ten, either one will get my vote.


BTW:  I am in no way associated with Volkswagen.  I have just seen more
Beetles, Transporters, and Golfs in service during my worldly travels
than any other make.
