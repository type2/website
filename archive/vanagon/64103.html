&gt;I think you may not need to be that cautious about overheating unless there

&gt;In our '90 Westy (only 80k miles), I can sit in traffic for many minutes
&gt;before the temp rises much, and it is always well-behaved when the fan
&gt;comes on low speed even with the AC on in 90 degree weather, so if your
&gt;radiator is in good shape, you shouldn't be having any problems and
&gt;shouldn't have to use the heater at all (except in winter, of course...).

Thanks David. I have gotten a lot of good feedback that makes me feel
more comfortable about the temperature question. 

I have gotten many very helpful replies such as yours on this and other 
questions. Thanks all.
