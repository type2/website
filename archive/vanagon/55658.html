Subject: Re: Questions--Re: WTB 86+ Westie Full Camper (long)

&gt;         1.  What are alloy wheels, and why do people go to such lengths to
&gt; get them?

Those of us who *tweek* our vans, frequently want 'better' looks, more
versatility in tires sizes, or some such.  As with anything that is
rare, prices soar.  VW only made one set of wheels that are cast out of
a light-weight aluminum alloy instead of being the heavier stamped
steel.  The steel wheels have plastic wheel covers, or 'hub-caps', that
some of us think fall off, break, or get scratched up too much.  So,
thus the 'hunt' for alloy wheels.

I have a syncro (4 wheel drive) camper van, and like to get way back in
the way back of nowhere to camp (I frequently go where many folks in
Jeeps don't go).  I need more clearance, larger, more rugged tires,
stiffer suspension, and, in general, a brain transplant.  ;)

So, I want 15&quot; instead of 14&quot; diameter rims, 6&quot; instead of 5.5&quot; width,
and something that looks 'cool' and doesn't fall off when I bounce over
a house-sized boulder.


&gt;         2. What is an ECU?  I gather it has to do with fuel injection.  Are
&gt; they fragile?

This is the 'computer' (Electronic Control Unit) that regulates such
things as spark firing and fuel to air mixture.  Without it you don't
go.  Period.

Are they fragile? NO.  Not compared with most other makes of vehicles. 
But, if one *does* go out, then it's very expensive - and most of us
bought VW's instead of Lamborgini's because we had only a 'little'
money!  :)

Also, if you notice, we VW van drivers think that a vehicle is just
getting broke in around 300K miles or so.  I've had 3 vans, my low
milage one is 135K, the highest one was an 1987 Syncro Camper, and I
managed to get a little over 500K on that in about 4 years before my ex
took it.

Out of about 1,000,000 miles on these three vans, I've had to replace
one ECU.  And I got that one used for $200.00.  (But I may have another
one going bad, haven't determined that yet.)


&gt; And the serious one:
&gt; 
&gt;         3.  One of the attractions for me of a VW bus is the reputation for
&gt; durability and economy.  Has that been lost by the Vanagon generation?  The
&gt; reason i've set my sights on an '85 or newer is that I need power steering
&gt; as well as AT due to physical disability, which is also the reason for my
&gt; strictly limited budget.

No.  These things are 'tanks'!  But they are VW's, and not made here in
the states anymore.  (Since '91)  And we rather feel abandoned by VW. 
Also, for some reason, there seems to be a lot less in the way of
aftermarket parts for Vanagons than for many other makes of vehicles.


&gt;         a. am I on a fool's errand, hoping to find for $8-9k a full camper
&gt; as late as '86 or so, in decent condition?  I looked at an '89 the other
&gt; day, advertised with a new reblt engine with a 3yr-36k warranty, at $12,995,
&gt; thinking the warranty would be valuable, but it was a *dog*!  Stank of smoke
&gt; and mildew and looked severely abused, like someone had let loose a circular
&gt; saw in there, and it just kept going, bouncing around off the cabinets,
&gt; etc., hacking and gouging wherever it landed.

Again, no.  Keep looking.  I bought an '85 full camper (Westfalia) in
beautiful condition for $6,200, and an '86 syncro for about $6,000. 
Both have needed maintenance, and some repairs, but less than you'd
expect for 10 year old vehicles, and *much* less than you'd expect for
the amount of miles on them.


&gt;         b. More seriously, reading of the quests some of you have had to
&gt; undertake to get certain parts, and the frequency with which, it appears,
&gt; engines need to be rebuilt before going even 100k -- is it a given, with a
&gt; Vanagon, that maintenance expenses will be frequent and high?

I don't keep meticulous records, like many on this list speak of, but I
do keep  my vehicles well maintained, and try to fix things *before*
they get serious.  In about 1,000,000 miles, on three vehicles, I have
not yet rebuilt an engine.  The two I'm running now both run well, one
has a 1.9 with about 300K on the engine, and the other has a 2.1 with
over 200K.


&gt; My sense is that, by definition, this list is made up of devotees, many of
&gt; whom may be perfectionists.  I do not intend to offend anyone by these
&gt; questions, but does the average Vanagon driver, or more particularly someone
&gt; with more time than money [but *no* mechanical experience to speak of,
&gt; except from the wrong side of the cash register :-(  ], have to be on
&gt; constant alert for failing heads and ECU's and CV's, etc.?

While I *can* do mechanic work, my skills and experience falls more in
the '60's and '70's Chevy small block area, and I can almost find my way
around a VW engine compartment.  I can change the plugs, and the oil
filter (but I'm not sure where to find the drain plug).  I'm very
intellegent, smart, (and my wife even thinks good looking, but I think
she's *strongly* biased) but I just don't have the time nor inclination
to do my own work.  I've got a good shop, I get to know my mechanics
well, but I don't pay high prices, and I get good service.

As an example:  I just picked up one of my vans, the shifter had gotten
too loose for me to trust the van with someone else driving (check that
mileage above ... :)  ).  I had the shifter completely rebuilt with
factory parts, the oil &amp; filter changed, some work done on the front
suspension, and a couple of other little things checked out/adjusted -
my total bill:  $110.00

&gt; I'm *not* looking for a project car, tho i'm eager and willing to understand
&gt; more about how my vehicle functions.  I want a compact, reliable, easily
&gt; handled, economical camper that will be my only vehicle; one I can use to
&gt; meander along the coast looking for tidepools and visiting friends, sleeping
&gt; overnite some of the time, and also serving as a &quot;sag wagon&quot; [as in
&gt; marathons and bike races] when I need a place to rest and regenerate during
&gt; the day.  I've had 2 previous VW buses [not cmpers], and think a Westfalia
&gt; full camper would be perfect [even more so, if it were 2' longer and had a
&gt; toilet  :-) ].  I thought my search would be simple, with all the older
&gt; Westies that are around, but discovered immediately on pulling out from the
&gt; curb in a '73 hippiemobile, complete with decals, that I could not handle
&gt; the steering.

Sounds like a 'Westy' candidate to me.  Keep looking, and good luck. 
I'm a serious Westy-Syncro addict, but I certainly couldn't handle a
'hippiemobile' either.  :)
