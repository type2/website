&gt;Diane smoke a cigarette (not allowed in the Campmobile).

Sure to irritate the SO this way, plus I don't like to stop until my bladder
says to.

        I had a cigar smoking friend, most forms of combustibles were OK in
the van, cigars weren't.  We settled on having his front vent wing open a
bit, and the fresh air duct on full and aimed right at it. The windflow
sucked the cigar smoke out as long as he rested his elbow+hand on the window
sill, and breathed out in the same area.  You want to keep the van AND the
SO don't you :)
