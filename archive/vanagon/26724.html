Subject:       I got grafitied

I went to watch the home comming game at my old highschool friday 
night and when I returned, I found written in perminant black marker 
on my white paint, a large anarchy symbol extending from my drivers 
window almost to the wheel well.  Some one must have taken offense of 
my peace symbols.  I spent quite a while with liquid soft scrub 
clenser trying to remove it, ending up with a much less prominent but 
still very agrivating light blue anarchy symbol.  Can anyone think of 
a good way to remove the ink with out harming the paint underneeth?
Thanks.
Ed.
