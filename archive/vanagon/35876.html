Subject: Electric Pump for Sink

Back in the dark ages when I owned my '70 bus and knew nothing about 
it other than how to shift gears, I rigged a windshield washer motor 
inline on the tube leading from the water supply to the hand pump. 
This gave me an option of electric or manual pumping of water.

It was a very simple mod and I'll be happy to supply details if 
there's interest.
