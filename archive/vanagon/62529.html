Subject: engine questions

As I was coming home, the van started blowing white smoke and then 
the oil light came on. The  engine is a VW rebuilt, still under 
warranty (thank the gods), I know that  the oil pressure is low for 
what it should be running . The question is ....
I had oil coming out of the tailpipe, the engine after cooling down 
and a tow home, is running rich. the O2 sensor is probably toast, is 
the cat converter also toasted? How do you check this?
TIA
