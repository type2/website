Subject: Re: what the heck? ... lookit all them Diesels!!!

Joel saves our collective ears by typing, rather than singing:
&gt;&lt;oh, mama, can this really be the end
&gt;to be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?&gt; :)

Perhaps it should be:
oh, mama, can this really be the end
to be stuck behind a Vanagon with them damned diesel fumes again?  ;-)
