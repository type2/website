Subject: installing guages

I'd to add some guages to my air cooled vanagon (oil temp, oil pressure, and 
maybe cylinder head temp).  How difficult is this to do?  I've seen a lot of 
discussion on the list, but I'm still not sure how and where the senders for 
these guages get installed.  

I'm sorry if this has been covered before, but I'm kinda looking for a 
one-stop &quot;how to&quot; source for this info.  Anyone?

TIA
