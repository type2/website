Subject: 050 Distributor Help!
Date: Sat, 26 Aug 1995 11:27:48 -0700 (PDT)

Hi,

	As y'all know, I installed an 050 distributor aways back.

	I went to adjust the valves today, and I can't get the notch on the
distributor to line up with the crank pulley and the case.  Its about a
quarter turn off, at best.

	It does line up perfectly on the &quot;backside&quot; ie 180 off!

	No, the distributor is in correctly, checked that!

	I'm stumped!  So I just put new oild in and went on my way.

	Any ideas?

Thankx!
Thom
