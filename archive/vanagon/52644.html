 Go with the specialist unless your regular mechanic is incredibly honest,
 helpful, and won't learn about an engine s/he's not familiar with on _your_
 time.

even then act like you are selecting a pediatrician for your new baby.  Many
so-called specialists are completely useless.

Sorry about a bit of negativism here but I just found that my mother's
mechanic for her 84 westy has been taking her for a ride.  I looked at her
car &amp; found the throttle switch had a broken lug for a long time (based on
the appearance of the break) and she had been complaining about intermittent
engine cutout.  Then the clutch felt funny, so I took it up a hill and put on
a load by shifting into a high gear and sure enough it started slipping.  He
declared the clutch OK only 1 week ago.

Example two.  I took my beast to a recommended VW / Audi expert to check on a
rear brake noise and he proceeded to take a torch to the drum and beat away
to separate the drum from the hub.  I finally bought the tool and did it
myself.

I suggest you interview, interview, and interview like you were hiring any
professional and then test em slowly as in example 2, above.  I'm still
looking, but will continue to try to do as much as I can myself.
