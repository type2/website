&gt;   but 2.7 liters does not seem to be the crossover point.  Note, however, that I
&gt;   haven't been through a winter with it yet.

I'd be interested in  your experience; my '87 already has  100,000 on it,
and I imagine I'll need to look for an engine for it in a couple of years.
Looks like you live in NJ from your e-mail, pretty comparable to the climate
out here in eastern PA, so your year-round experience with every aspect of the
transplant will be useful for me...

It also sounds pretty lucrative to be able to
surprise other drivers in my '82 diesel Westy, but it probably will not get
enough miles on it to require a new engine in the foreseeable future.


&gt;   have to get it to fit and shift.  If I put another $1500 in, it will be for
&gt;   air conditioning from ICE, first.
&gt;
&gt;   B.

I was wondering about that.  Would I have to guve up AC in my '87  and get
their A/C parts (compressor, etc..)???

BTW, one of my neighbors has a VW bug with the plates: &quot;POORSCH&quot; 
on it -- everytime I get a great idea, somebody beats me to it :-)
