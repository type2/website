Subject:      FFFFriday Follies: Holiday Hollerings ...

well, it's friday for a lot of us, and the holidays are fast approaching
(at almost the same rate as the money is disappearing!!), so i thought
it would be nice if i gave you folks some NEW! IMPROVED! MORE POWERFUL!
holiday songs to sing while you were shopping in the malls and such ...
just so other saner people would look at you and immediately give you
a lot more room to shop. :)

here's a couple of olde favourites ...
--------------------------------------

Otto the Automatic
     (to the tune of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer)

Otto the Automatic
Shifted gears without a clutch,
And if you ever drove him,
You might say he wasn't much.

All of the other buses
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Otto
Drive in any highway games.

Then one day their clutches broke,
And they could not shift gears.
Otto towed them one by one,
To the Mech who fixed their rears.

Then how the buses loved him,
As they shouted out with glee:
Otto the Automatic,
You'll go down in Bus-story!

--------------------------------------

Rusty the Syncro
    (to the tune of Frosty the Snowman)

Rusty, the Syncro,
Is a big old happy van,
With his extra gear, you need never fear
Going four-wheel cross the land.

Rusty, the Syncro,
Has this extra stuff, you know,
So his front wheels grip if the rear ones slip
And you mush right through the snow.

There must have been some little gnomes
That built him underground,
Cause when he gets into the woods
He begins to dance around.

Rusty, The Syncro,
Loves to play in mud and snow,
And to climb the hills, just for extra thrills,
Go where buses shouldn't go.

Rusty, the Syncro,
Is a stable sort of van,
While the others slip, his four wheels will grip,
And he'll muddle through again.

Down through the village,
He will drive with little doubt,
Over ice and snow, anywhere he'll go,
While the others slide about.

He'll drive right through the streets of town,
All axle-deep in slop,
And he only pauses, if at all,
When a red light makes him stop.

Oh, Rusty, the Syncro,
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye, saying don't you cry,
I'll be back again someday.

------------------------------------------

:)
so let's all be careful out there, and come back again for another year.
and remember! improperly cooked turkey can make you do the Turkey Trot. :)
