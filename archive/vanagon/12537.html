The requests are pouring in.... duh, right dan?

Gerry is looking at the posiblity of putting graphic pictures (Steve, 
Ric this is your cue) in a retrievable format.

If everybody could hold off for a while til we sort out the graphic 
files stuff I'd appreciate it.  I'll try to send out the requests so 
far.
