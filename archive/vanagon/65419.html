From:         Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_UA1VM.UA.EDU&gt;
Subject:      heater boxes/asbestos replacement ..

ok, i had this theory that the replacements were being done on a specific
range of years, and that the material used in the heater boxes might have
been &quot;contaminated&quot; with some sort of PCB's or other such toxic ( or
later-having-been-found-to-be-toxic) chemicals or materials, possibly
even some low-level radiactive stuff.

no such luck. here's the data:
dates ranged all over the place, from February 1997 to September 1997.

locations ranged from Alabama to Wisconsin,

the model years were as follows:
1972 - 3      (but ONE (Andy Mckinley) was told &quot;wrong boxes&quot;
              and they didn't replace his!)
1973 - 5
1974 - 3
1975 - 1
1976 - 2
1977 - 2
1978 - 1
1979 - 2
1980 - 2
1981 - 0 *
1982 - 1
1983 - 0 *
*nobody responded with one of these years

so there's nothing about the years that suggests any starting and
cut-off years or models (camper, non-camper, etc.).

notice, however, that they are ALL Type 4 engines. NO TYPE 1 ENGINES
WERE SELECTED. now, as i recall it, my 71 bus has asbestos all over
the exhaust gaskets and the heater boxes. so why not the Beetle
engined buses??

but over that range of years, the engine CODES varied, and not all
the heater boxes are interchangeable.

ok, so nothing. :(

would all you 1972's send me your VIN's and let me see if Andy's is somehow
lowest of all?? like they didn't want his because it was PRIOR to the
whatever-the-hell-it-is they are replacing??

also: did they take the old parts with them?? or did anyone see them trash
the old parts??

i just find it very hard to believe that a large company would do such a
thing without the strong encouragement of a slew of lawyers and/or the
impending threat of somebody suing them. a &quot;survey&quot; just doesn't wash with
me. but, indeed, they have NOT contacted ALL the 72's or 73's or any of
the years involved. why not??

curiouser and curiouser. :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ok, now ... are the women and children all out of the room?? good. now here's
the REAL poop, as to why Le Coz and his minions are getting this stuff from
your buses!!!

Le Coz  spelled backwards it's  Zoc-el  ... ring a bell with anyone?? yup.
EVERYbody from Superman's planet of Krypton had names ending in -el!!!
somehow, their spaceship must have depleted it's fuel supply, and this
whatever material that was used in the Type 4 engine heater boxes is somehow
necessary for them to refuel and go home (since the current number of
humans is very rapidly approaching a screaming teeming mass of
killing-each-other animals!). or maybe it's not fuel, but they need the
asbestos for an ablative heat shield ... either on the front of the
spaceship or maybe in the engine compartment. and ONLY the &quot;heat-treated&quot;
stuff from old VW Type 4 engines will do .... sort of like the reverse of
the old &quot;sacrifice the virgin&quot; routine.

well ... you can't prove they AREN'T aliens!! :)

happy Friday.
