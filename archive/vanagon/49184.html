Greetings from the eastside of the Range of Light!

Just in case any of you would be interested in keeping up to speed on 
Mammoth's weather, here's the URL for it:

http://www.wunderground_dot_com/forecasts/MMH.html

If you are coming from LA or the Bay Area, you might think it's cold 
here. I would expect the weather to be what *we* call Indian Summer... 
very mild and BEAUTIFUL! We rarely get precipitation in the form of 
rain... if we do get rain, it happens in the heat of summer during 
thunder shower season. (We are WELL out of that pattern)

The temperatures should be getting into the 40s at night and somewhere 
between 55 - 70 during the day. 

You should come prepared for anything from warm to cold... (Her Majesty 
never goes anywhere without foul weather gear for us.) So - if you have 
a GoreTex shell... BRING IT! Like Mark Twain wrote: &quot;Only fools and 
newcomers try to predict the weather in the Sierra!&quot; And, like I tell 
all the visitors on my nature walks: &quot;If you don't like the weather in 
the Sierra, just wait 20 minutes, it'll change.&quot;

This isn't meant to scare anybody off, it's just to help you come 
better prepared.

If any of you need more info, please feel free to contact me.
