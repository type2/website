This was exactly the case when I bought mine.  She advertised it as 
'rebuilt', but when she showed me the receipts, only the top end had
been worked on.  At this point emotion had taken over, and I bought
it anyway (for probably too much money).  I've never regretted it.

You can get a lot more money for your vw if it is running with a fresh
engine.  And engines don't cost that much.

Hmmm....
