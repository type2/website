&gt;If we gather the info correctly we will have a strong case for presenting

 lawsuit.

I am wondering what the status is regarding the archive. I am going to 
go through the BBB Autoline mediation/arbitration process very soon. I am
wondering if I can have a copy of this archive to show the mediator/
arbitrator that the head gasket problem is an engineering/design defect
of VW since so many vanagons have the problem.

Al, can you respond to this? Appreciated.
