&lt;&lt;I believe that your Vanagon, like many 10-year-old busses, suffers from
&quot;rear end sag&quot;.  This is especially profound in the Westfalia camper model.

I have an old issue of HotVW's magazine that describes a procedure for
raising the rear end back up where it's supposed to be.  Basically, you &quot;wind&quot;
the trailing arms of the rear suspension.  Email me for details.&gt;&gt;

The only things is that the Vanagon has coilsprings instead of torsion bars
that can be re-adjusted.
