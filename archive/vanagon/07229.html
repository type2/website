&gt; 
&gt; What needs to be removed in order to pull this sucker out?  So far I've
&gt; removed the tie-rod end and stabilizer.  Do I really have to remove the
&gt; whole wheel bearing hub assembly in order to press the half-shaft out
&gt; of the bearing?  I've tried pressing off the shaft with the assembly still
&gt; attached, but there doesn't seem to be enough room for the stub to clear
&gt; the bearing assembly.
&gt; 
&gt; Any pointers, or confirmation that everything _does_ need to be removed would
&gt; be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

To get the half shaft off, first remove the big nut in the center and the 
inner cv bolts.  Then remove the brace caliper and hang it out of the 
way.  Next remove the two hex bolts on the top of the upright.  When 
those are removed, swing the upright out of the way and use every 
contortionist trick you can to get the shaft off the car

good luck!
