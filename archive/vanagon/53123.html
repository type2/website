Subject: head cap nuts

Hello I am a former list member with an urgent question:
I have an 84 1.9L Vanagon taht I am replacing the head seals on.
My question is this.. Do the head cap nuts have a washer to be
installed?  When I took them apart They certainly did, however, 
there is no indication in Bently that there are washers!
In fact they say to put the sealant on the bottom surface of
the cap nut... no mention of washers at all.  I f there were
washers wouldn't they suggest coating both sides of the
washer?  I know that this engine had fingers in it before
so could it be possible that this was some post d factory
invention by a shade treer.  

Question: Is the fat black ring gasket in the head gasket repair
kits for the water pump?

Any response would be greatly appreciated.
Since I am no longer a list member Please email
me at copich_at_calvin.duq_dot_edu

thany you
