Subject: Air-Cooled Rescue T-Shirts-NOW

Howdy all. Join that exclusive club- the Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team. All
you need is the passion for old VW's, and the desire to fill your yard and
driveway with them. After that, all you really need is the official team
t-shirt. Here's your chance to custom order your own specific size of shirt.
Get'm while they're hot!
 I figured since I am going to do the Air Cooled Search and Rescue Team
t-shirts anyway, I'd offer them up here before I get them printed, so that if
anyone wants to order them, you can specify the size. The deal is pretty much
the same as the list shirts, but here's an IMPORTANT catch-
The order goes in Wednesday. I plan to order ONLY XL shirts, unless I am aware
before hand that you ARE DEFINATELY ordering a different size.
THEREFORE-
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IF you e-mail me Monday (today) or Tuesday (tomorrow) or Wednesday BEFORE NOON
and tell me that you are ordering, and mailing a check, and tell me you want a
Medium or small or XXL or whatever, I will special order it for you.
OTHERWISE, if you don't tell me, and order a shirt, it will be XL. I hope this
is perfectly clear.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MATERIAL:
  The shirts are printed on high quality colored t-shirts that will hold up
through years of washing and working on the bus. Usually I get Hanes Beefy T's,
or a comparable name brand quality.
DESIGN:
 On a gray t-shirt, there will be a red firemans' crest- you know the fat, four
pointed cross that a lot of fire departments and rescue squads use as a logo.
In the center will be the VW logo. On the top leaf will be a line drawing of
the side view of a split window bus. On the bottom leaf will be a drawing of an
early Beetle. On the left leaf will be the word &quot;Protect&quot;, and on the right
leaf, the word &quot;Save&quot; (Protect &amp; Save, get it?) Above the crest will be the
words &quot;Air Cooled&quot; and underneath the words &quot;Search and Rescue&quot;
PRICE:
 A basic t-shirt costs $16.00, which includes postage and handling charges.
 This is for adult sizes S,M,L, and XL
 XXL shirts are available, for an extra $2.00 They are large enough to fit
those of you requiring a XXXL, which is sadly not available.
 SHIPPING for NON-USA orders requires an additional $5.00. This is for the
additional postage required. These orders should be preferrably paid in US
cash, or an international money order, which must be in US DOLLARS.

ORDERING INFORMATION:
  Please follow these directions specifically to help things work smoothly.
Note also that the directions are a bit different from in the past.
INCLUDE:
 1. A check made out to Richard Palmer (or well-hidden cash)
 2. An index card with your name, address, SIZE OF SHIRT, number of shirts, and
      your e-mail address

******PLEASE WRITE NEATLY!!!!!!!!!*************

ON THE ENVELOPE:
  Address it to:
  Richard Palmer
  121 - C Park Ave
  Raleigh, NC
         27605-1832

:)
Ok then, if you want one, please advise me IMMEDIATELY, if not sooner.
Otherwise, I'm just going to order a flat amount of XL's. Thank you all very
kindly, and have a lovely day.
