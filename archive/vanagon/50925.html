 A Rabbit heater core can be used in a pinch.  Requires some clearancing of
 the shrouding around the heat exchanger to make it fit.  You lose the
ability
 to turn it off in the summer, unless you add in a Rabbit heater valve in one
 of the water lines.  On the plus side, you get to keep most of the $140 that
 the dealer wants for a new one and the $70 that most junkyards are asking
for
 used ones.

Believe it or not, I have been able to get the rear heater cores aftermarket.
 Cost is still high at around $100.00.  Front cores still not available to my
knowledge.  You could try fitting with VW to get them to repalce it if you
have all documentation for maintenance of the van.
