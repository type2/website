COME ON PEOPLE, there is years of good information regarding
the fixing of this common problem in the archives, in fact
Gerry has a really nice FAQ system going on the new WWW archive
sytem.  Go there make decisions, save money, JB weld em yourself
and save lots of money?  AVP probably wants less than $250 each
rebuilt FWIW call them (800)548-5766.  Geez O wheez though the
archives are there, use em for a change.  And harass VW, if under
100k or so you may be able to swing 50% for dealer repair, never
rule it out though it will be highly dealer dependent.  But at
$500 each you could get a rebuilt AVP longblock almost, save some
money, your Wasserboxer will thank you.
