Subject: brain needed (81)

the mechanic who rebuilt my van's engine has eliminated other
possibilities (that we can think of, anyway), and thinks i may need a new
computer (vw part# 043 906 021).  the van ran fine when i brought it in
before the rebuild, who knows what could've happened.  so...i'm looking
for a brain for an 81.  i have one question - is there any difference
between the california and non-california models wrt the brain?  any
leads on locating one (used?) would be appreciated.  thanks.
