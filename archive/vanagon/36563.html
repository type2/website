Subject: Cetin's Eurovan Test Drive



&gt;
&gt;For those of you who have never driven an EV, and wondering what it
&gt;feels like, Matt Drahzal put it very well:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;It's a VW bus that drives like a VW rabbit...&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Cetin
&gt;

When I went to Cetin's house in NuBus ('82 Diesel), I just had to take
his Eurovan out for some fun. So, my impressions were:

 - Solid vehicle

 - More powerful than NuBus (Cetin's dog is more powerful than NuBus)

 - Nice tight steering

 - Firm, tuetonic shifter

Felt &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;sporty&quot; rather than mushy and Detroit.
