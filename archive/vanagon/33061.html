Subject: New idiot incident! DUH

The wife called this AM and asked if I realized that the garage door (that
faces an alley opposing the low rent  apartments near a major street) was
open. ( I last checked it late Sunday night.)
I calmly  asked her as I went ballistic, &quot;You mean the mean the same garage
that I just moved all of my tools, new-never used 1776 engine, new
Delorttos, Tents, Westy Rack, and every single item that has ever, ever been
gathered for the '67 Westy Resto from Heck and other projects?&quot;
 YES!
&lt;and the '57 single cab loaded with the SO-42 interior pieces?&gt;
 YES!
&quot;You mean the garage that I made sure that the main door was down and the
side door was double locked?&quot;
YES!
 &quot;Uh, no...&quot;

A quick check by the wife revealed that all was well on the Western front.
The auto opener will be DOA as of tonight with a paddle lock on the inside.
Meanwhile stuck here at work... Grrrr.
Now THAT is an idiot incident! Whew!
