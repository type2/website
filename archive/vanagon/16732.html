&gt; &lt;i actually was going to buy a radar gun for this express
&gt; purpose!! until i found out how much they cost!!! :(  &gt;


Popular Electronics had a how-to-do-it article on how to build a radar
speed gun last week. They cite a source for the complete kit, including
PC board and hard-to-find microwave parts. Go for it!
