Kevin,

There are now over 20 EVs on the list. I have a 93 bought in Feb. 93,
and it just rolled to 41k miles as I drove into the driveway today.

No major problems, its a blast to drive, handles well. Got rid of the
original tires at 35k miles, replaced them with Michelin MXL reinforced
tires.

Isn't it nice to have a VW van that has heat!  8)

Welcome to the EV fold.

Ric
