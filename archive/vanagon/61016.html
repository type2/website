&gt; I have an instrument cluster problem that has plagued me since I put the gas
&gt; engine in my diesel vanagon a year ago.  To get closer to solving it I have
&gt; come up with two things I don't know.
&gt; 1. Would someone with a diesel vanagon tell me what the room temp resistance
&gt;    of their temperature sensor is.
&gt; 2. Would some elctronic type out there tell me what red red black white means
&gt;    on a resistor. (It measures about 20 Ohms).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

	resistor color you mentioned indicates 22 ohms But Ive no idea 
what the white band meas this is normally used for tolerance may be the 
white was another color at one time but not too critical
