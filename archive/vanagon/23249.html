&gt;On my 69 that pull out knob on the left controls the rear dome light!
&gt;I also get blown all over the road but my steering isn't that loose.

On my '71, I've rewired the pull knob to control the rudder, which helps
some with getting blown all over the road...and serves as a handy
supplement to steering.   8-) Sorry, couldn't quite wait for friday.

Seriously, the dome pull knob is on the right on my '71.
