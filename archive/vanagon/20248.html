&gt; I have a '66 westfalia with a 1776 engine.  The oil temp has been running at
&gt; around 180-185, this being around town and driving to work.  Just recently I
&gt; stated working a much warmer area and the oil temp now creeps up to 190-200
&gt; degrees.  Does anyone know the proper running temp and how high the temp can
&gt; go before I must stop to cool it off.  I run 20-50w oil with doghouse cooler,
&gt; and oil pressure running at a constant 45 psi at speed,  15-20 psi at idle
&gt; when warm.

Your temps sound fine.  230 is about the upper limit you should consider
acceptable, although I know lots of people including myself that see
higher temps regularly.  This question has been asked quite often, is
there a FAQ that the answer could be added to?  I should know the answer
to that - I've been on the list long enough.  :/
