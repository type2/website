I don't believe in stereotypes and I don't make blind assumptions.  The initial 
point of this time-wasting argument was that the list sticker should not have 
anything to do with the Dead.  Some people made it a point to drag out sixties 
drug culture stuff as a reason why, and I for some reason decided to respond to 
this argument (my own error) on the wrong side, for the simple reason that I 
thought someone was being too naive regarding a connection between drug use by 
band members and drug use by some fans, but I think that overall the point was 
made that the only thing that all the people on this list have in common is the 
love of the VW.  Therefore, a likeness of Jerry Garcia would not be appropriate 
to please everyone on the list.  But whatever.

Obviously, not all Deadheads use drugs.

Obviously, most Deadheads who use drugs don't do it because the cool band guys 
smoke pot.

Obviously, not all Deadheads drive VW's.

Obviously, not all VW owners are Deadheads.

But, I think we can all agree that all VW owners are drug users.

Kidding, of course.

Peace
