Subject: Trip to South America

My wife and I are planning a driving trip to South America via the Pan
American highway probably leaving around September of next year.

We were wondering which vehicle would be best to take.  We chose the 86 VW
Weekender for a 3 month trip from Boston through Canada.  In Europe we
lived in for 6 months a 92 VW Hightop Full Camper with an absolutely
wonderful 2.4l Diesel that delivered 30-35 mpg and plenty of passing power.
 The diesel was great due to the 600 mile+ range and the reduced fuel cost.

I read that unleaded fuel can be hard to get in South America and it would
be a good idea to remove the catalytic converter after crossing into
Mexico, so you can burn leaded fuel and then put it back on upon before
returning to the US.  I am not a fan of polluting the air, but I wouldn't
want to run out of gas in a jungle in Brazil either.

1) Does anybody know what adjustments would have to be made to a gas
powered Vanagon motor if the catalytic converter were removed?  Would the
fuel injectors be affected?  Would the aircooled version be a better bet?

2) If we decide on Diesel is it possible to put a more powerful motor in
the Vanagon? Or is the 1.8L 48 HP the limit? 

I would like to thank everyone who responded to the dual fuel tank
question.  Range is the other issue.  225 mile range of the standard
Vanagon would probably make for some tense situations worrying about making
the next gas station.  I don't really relish the thought of running out of
gas in the middle of nowhere.  The range of the diesel is probably adequate
but the gas powered ones would require carrying extra fuel in some of the
more remote places.
