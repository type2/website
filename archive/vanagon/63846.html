I believe it's eight quarts, look in the drivers manual under
capacities.I am not at my vehicle now, email me back if you can not find
it. I guess you  successfulley repaired the broken off bolt?
 Just taking off the bottom hose is usually not enough. I drive the front
wheels up on ramps and then remove both hoses and open the flush tee I
installed in the heater hose. Remeber to turn the heat control to hot and
open the valve on the heater under the back seat. Also open the bleeder
bolt on the radiator and open the filler cap on the resevoir. I never use
more than 50%. I hear that a stronger reading might confuse the level
sensor.
Good Luck &amp; Drive Safely

&gt;1.  How much coolent does the system hold?  
&gt;I removed one lower radiator hose and the thermostat housing so there
&gt;should not be very much coolent remaining in the system.
&gt;
&gt; I have the bleeding process down, but need a general idea as to how
&gt;much antifreeze I will need to add.  I am going for a 30% water, 70%
&gt;antifreeze mixture. This is alot of work. 
&gt;
&gt; I don't think I would trust many garages to do this job correctly. 
&gt;Most people won't apply this much effort to getting it right.
