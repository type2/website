Subject: Re: Coolant manifold leak

The manifold is not the plastic piece that's been discussed on the list
recently. And it's not available in metal as far as I know. It is plastic on
my syncro (87 Westy). But it is a failure-prone part of the cooling system,
as you have learned the hard way.

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;         Well I finally crawled under the Westy to find out which water
&gt;hose broke that ruined my drive home from a Christmas Eve party,and left
&gt;me stranded on I5. It turned out to be a split in the plastic manifold
&gt;that 4 hoses attach to just ahead of number 1 cylinder. I have read many
&gt;times on the list about a plastic part in the coolant system that fails
&gt;and that VW made a metal replacement for. Is this the part that everyone
&gt;has had trouble with. If it is then something someone said sometime back
&gt;is wrong. I remember it being said that VW changed this part to metal on
&gt;the Syncros. Mine is a early Syncro and the part is still plastic. I
&gt;wish it would have been metal. If this is not the part that has been
&gt;discussed on the list, exactly wich part is it?
