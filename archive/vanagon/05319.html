Some friends and I were discussing this at work.

Question:  Which is more likely to cause injury to a driver:

	A.  Driver runs car into a brick wall at 50 mph
	B.  Driver has headon collision with another car going 50mph 
	    (combined speed 100mph)

Assumption and hint: The wall is made out of steel with bricks painted
on it and will not move or absorb 

Answer:  neither is more likely to cause injury.  Reasoning: in case B
there are *two* crumple zones and each absorbs half of the energy.  If
you have trouble picturing this, just imagine if both of the cars in
case B ran into a wall from opposite sides simultaneously.  Looks like
2 x case A, doesn't it??  :)

Oh, and I don't think that 2 cars traveling at 50 mph contain as much 
kinetic energy as 1 car traveling at 100mph.  I remember something 
about 1/2mv^2...

Here's another question, but please don't answer it on the list.
Say you're on a boat in a lake.  You have an iron cannonball in the
boat with you.  If you were to throw the cannonball overboard, would
the water level of the lake go up or down??
