Subject: Re: Mystery dash outlet '83.5 GL Westy

&gt;Ok, there's what looks like an extra electrical socket about halfway 
&gt;between the cig lighter and the glove box.  Its maybe slightly larger 
&gt;than the headphone plug on a stereo amp.  I can't see behind it to look 
&gt;for wires. 
&gt;
&gt;Doe's anyone know what it is?  If it is a plug,  what kinds of 
&gt;accessories fit it?  I'm pretty sure it isn't a pencil sharpener.

Yes, that's the name of that outlet - the &quot;mystery outlet&quot; but the only real
mystery is why VW put these European style outlets in the dashes of the US
import Westy's, and basically included practically no accessories to fit it. 
These outlets were standard in all '74-'84 Westfalias. I have only ever seen 2
accessories that fit in here. on the '74 &amp; '75 westy's there was a small air
compressor to inflate that &quot;spacesaver spare&quot; tire (you actually had to inflate
the tire before you could use it - kind of the &quot;Edsel&quot; of spacesaver spare
tires......) needless to say this early version of the &quot;inflate before you use
it&quot; spare only lasted 2 yrs, then they went back to a full size
spare......uh....wonder why???...  Anyway, the '74-'75 westy air compressor pump
plug fit in here, and I have seen a small cigarette lighter fit in here. This is
a HELLA only item. The HELLA plugs are still available, and they are $12 each.
You can wire the HELLA plug into any 12v accessory that you would be able to run
off a conventional cigarette lighter .  

thanks for reminding me - I need to order a couple too.
