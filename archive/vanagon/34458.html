&gt; One of the assertions was that synoil was 10% more effective at heat

&gt;he had tried and abandoned synoil because his oil temp. increased 10* to
&gt;20*(he may not have been that specific).Hence this question: Wouldn't that
be
&gt;a good thing rather than bad if it means that the oil is &quot;transfering&quot; 10%
&gt;more heat(10* -20*) from the interior of the engine to the cooler?
&gt;I'll admit upfront that this is strictly an academic exercise for me since I
&gt;have very little understanding of things mechanical but do enjoy hearing the
&gt;&quot;pros&quot; hash one out.

Oil temp may have been raised by overfilling crankcase.  Most oil heat comes
form bearing friction and the friction of the oil itself traveling through
the engine.  This is how oil gets hotter than the engine water temparature.
  Most synthetics have charachtersistics that allow them to run cooler than
conventional lubricants.  If better heat transfer allows it to pick up more
heat, that same effect allows it to dissipate that heat.  I hope this answers
your question.
