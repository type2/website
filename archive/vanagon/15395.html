&gt;I have a '90 Syncro, and the grey factory tag on the license plate
&gt;door says this;
&gt;&quot;this vehicle conforms to US EPA regulations applicable to 1990 model
&gt;year new light duty trucks&quot;
&gt;So, could one assume that my vecicle could be imported into the
&gt;US (maybe except California)?

that will get you past the EPA, but you'll need to find the DOT sticker
somewhere that says you pass the safety standards. it might be on the
oil filler license plate flap (can't recall zactly where). if you find that
one, and you should, then yup. according to what the Seattle customs folks
told me, you can definitely import it into the u.s. it won't cost nearly
as much to do it with yours ... except for the import duty of 25 percent! :)

of course, a totally unscrupulous person (which none of us are) who would
lie and cheat on his taxes (which none of us would) COULD decide to have a
Bill of Sale made out for only a small fraction of the value of the bus ...
that would drastically shrink the import tax. :)  say, sell the bus for
$5000 on one Bill of Sale, and sell the radio in it for, oh, $10,000??? :)

none of us would ever even THINK of such a thing, of course. ;)
