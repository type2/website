It didn't sound that way to me.  Personally, I would have been very 
upset if someone (anyone) dinged a fresh paint job.  And would have been 
twice as mad if they said it was &quot;only a VW&quot; and shrugged it off.  I 
think it would have been better to cut a valve stem or two... cheaper to 
fix, but more time consuming.  :)

I'd like to request that we get back to VW stuff.  At least something 
more cheerful than flaming.
