Subject: MPG Wasserboxer AutoBoxer vs. Wasserboxer Manual Tranny

I am looking for a Vanagon 87-91 for my wife, she wants an automatic, I 
prefer manuals for ease of maintenance, power and mileage. Anyone have 
any raw figures on the difference on mileage on between an autoboxer and 
a manual tranny Vanagon in the 87 to 91 range? Any feedback appreciated.
Regards
