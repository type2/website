Subject: 81 2.0L AFC, oil cooler question

The list wisdom seems to be that if there's any bearing damage,
replace the oil cooler.  I have some scraped up crank bearings and
there are little flakes of metal sitting under the oil strainer,
so I need to replace the oil cooler.  

The question is, new or rebuilt?  New &gt; $150, rebuilt ~$40.  Do
the rebuilt ones get flushed &quot;well enough&quot;?  Anyone have horror
stories?  Opinions?
