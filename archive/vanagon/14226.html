Subject: Re: hakuna matata

&gt;Don't know what language it's in, but presumably it is in Swahili as the
&gt;Disney people usually do their homework.  It is a song title in *The Lion
&gt;King* movie/video, so most parents of 3-8 year olds in the US can sing at
&gt;least a few words of it.  &quot;Hakuna Matata means no worries&quot;, during the
&gt;period that Simba is partying with his pals, eating grubs and ignoring his
&gt;birthright.  Hope I haven't given away too much of the plot.

If Simba was Austrailian he would simply say, &quot;No worries, No drama&quot;. This
seems to be the traditional Aussie phrase for everything. The enet
conversion would be = NWND
