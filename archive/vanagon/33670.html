&gt; Seperate subject.  The drivers door lock (85 Vanagon) can
&gt; only be locked from the outside with the key.  Is there a
&gt; way to disable this 'anti-lock-out' feature?  It sure is
&gt; annoying.

&gt; -Gregg

I understand your problem.  Same on my '84 GL.  You can beat
the system the way I do...go out the passenger side and cry
when you see your keys in the ignition.

Actually, this 'anti-lock-out' feature is an improvement
over the older buses for which you could only lock both
doors with a key once you were outside.  It is only an
improvement when you remember your keys.  Granted, this only
applied to the &quot;front&quot; doors and cargo doors.  You could
always crawl out the rear hatch (if you had the special
low-tech inside rear hatch opening mechanism).

I do have some familiarity with the handles, and the locks,
and I suspect that even if you switched handles it would
make no difference because that feature is built into the
actual lock inside the door.
