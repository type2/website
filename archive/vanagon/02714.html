&gt; I just have two requests for the trip that I hope 
&gt; everyone addresses before they go on this long haul.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Please.....PLEASE! don't embark on this trip with tires
&gt; that are not up to it.  Start with tires with good deep tread
&gt; on all four wheels and one good spare that is properly inflated.

Well of course.  I've benn running bais ply since I got my bus about 3-4 
years ago.  And I've had to pick up a couple pairs at the junk yard.  But 
before I did any long trip I would get some steel belted radials.  They 
make a big handling difference.

&gt; 2) Please....PLEASE oh PLEASE! have your headlights on your
&gt; vehicle properly aimed.  The last thing I want is some bugger
&gt; in my rear with one of his headlights aimed directly at my
&gt; rear view mirror.    

This is one of the things that I always hate.  I think a headlight should 
be aimed properly, both highs and lows.
