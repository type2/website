Subject: Free German=English Email Translator Service

I located a email responder called Barcelona where you send them stuff
written in German and they shoot it back to you in English. Free! The web
site seems to be 

http://www.globalink_dot_com

Anybody want to shoot them instructions for using a unisyn for syncronizing
dual carbs and then have them translate it back into English? It would be
amusing to see the result. 

I wonder if they can actually translate words we use like &quot;crankshaft,&quot;  &quot;CV
Joints,&quot; and &quot;woodruf key.&quot;

If the translator actually works (the free service is limited to 2K files at
one time; about two paragraphs) then we could be in for a bonanza. Joel has
some awsome German language books on Vanagon that almost none of us can read.
