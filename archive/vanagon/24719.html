Agreed on the GBG part.  I read this very carefully many times before my 
last project.  The seal isn't leaking because I'm putting it in wrong.  
It's leaking because the end play is way out there and I'm concerned 
because I don't think I can fix it because the motion is not the flywheel 
against the case, it's the bearing sliding in the case.
Thanks!
