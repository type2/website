Hi: No, the VW Gods don't hate you they are just testing you to see if
you are worthy. If you fix your problems you will be found worthy and
will be rewarded with miles and miles of enjoyable driving. ToddPerry

&gt; I've just got into the volkswagen thing about 2 years ago. I bought my van
&gt; just before winter and stored the thing because it had never been winter
&gt; driven. When we took it out this summer we put 30,000 worry free miles on
&gt; our vanagon. Since this is our only vehicle now we have to drive it in the
&gt; winter.:( This winter has been hell for the van. First the heater motor,
&gt; then the sliding door thing, now this running on three cylinders thing! The
&gt; Vw dub mechanics here in Sudbury Ontario SUCK. I've replaced spark plug
&gt; wires, cap and rotor, fuel filters, that expensive o2 sensor. After
&gt; replacing the o2 sensor I thought the whole problem was fixed. But tonight
&gt; my wife tells me that the thing is acting up again. I don't know what else
&gt; to look for????? It seems like the engine is missing aon one off the
&gt; cylinder under load? When it rev's up to higher rpm's it seem to kick that
&gt; 4th cylinder in. I will change the spark plugs, I have bosch platinum's in
&gt; the van know. I really don't want to bring my van back to the dealer. They
&gt; have cost me $500,00 in two weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; Ps If I can't find the problem I will have to sell our van:(:( Please help
&gt; u guys have been great in the past. I've fixed most of the other stuff with
&gt; your help but this one driving me nuts.!
