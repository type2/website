Subject: Your computer's Pentium CPU:  OLD or NEWER?
Date: Wed, 19 Jul 1995 14:57:06

Does your computer have the OLD Pentium CPU, with the floating point error, 
or does it have the NEWER CPU with the problem corrected?

Here's a simple test to find out:

&gt;From Windows, pull up the Accessories Group.  Double Click on the Calculator.  
To get to the scientific calculator mode, pull down View to Scientific.

Enter:  1 / 824633702441.0 =

The result should be 0.000000000001212659629409
(That's 11 zeros following the decimal point.)

Enter:  * 824633702441.0 =

If the answer is 1, your machine has the later CPU.  (That's good.)  
Otherwise, Intel will replace your CPU for free.  Intel:  1-800-628-8686
