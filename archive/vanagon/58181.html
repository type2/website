&gt;        Well, at this point I have replaced the filter and the fuel line.
&gt;The fuel line seemed to help a little, but I am still not there yet,
&gt;
&gt;        What seal are we talking about? Are you talking about the seal on
&gt;the shaft that is between the injection lines?  Can this be done without
&gt;removing the pump (as I do not have the tool for retiming the pump)?
&gt;
The seal I'm talking about is behind the injection pump pulley. You have to
partially remove the timing belt to get to it.
