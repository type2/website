Subject: hub cap w/speedo connector question

Hey?
Is the hub cap on the drivers side, which connects the speedometer, the 
same in the bugs as in the Vanagons?  I got a friend who says they are, I 
really don't know.
The situation:  A 1985 Vanagon with no hub cap, new rotor, bearings, 
seal, and I need the cap.  Parts stores say no go, VW garage says a 
week.  Oh, also, the little lock washer thing is bent and destroyed.  Are 
they maybe the same also?  I would appreciate any help.  Sorry about the 
loose terminology, but, that is as good as I can get.  Maybe to clarify, 
the washer sits on the spindle, and the cap goes over top of 
everything....OK, maybe that isn't any better.
