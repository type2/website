Subject: re  oil temps

&gt;long time no asking for advice and picking you brain. If you have
&gt;forgotten I own an 82 Vanagon and I put a GEX rebuild in it about 6
&gt;months ago. My question to you is I just got a VDO oil
&gt;temp gage and I would like to see where the temp should be. When I am
&gt;driving on flat highway its reads between 180-210, but when I start to
&gt;climb mountains, I live in colorado, it gets up to 250. Is that too high?
&gt;It has never run higher than 250. I just put Castrol synthetic 5w 50 in
&gt;and it stills runs the same temps. I am kind of worried because it is
&gt;winter and cold and it is running these temps.

The 180-210 sounds right, but the 250 when climbing is a little high,
particular if you're driving in particular Colorado weather. It was when
mine exhibited similar behaviour that I found that I had a leaking cylinder
head. Since repairing it, I think it's only been up to about 230F tops.
Note that this temperature is not bad for the oil, but getting 250-260F
seems to be hard on the valves, and may indicate something not working
properly.
You might want to take the time to do a leakdown test to see if everything
is still working correctly.

Of course, putting synthetic oil in it probably changes things, as does
operating at a higher altitude, but that's all the experiential data I
have.
(I would point out that several mechanics have told me never to put
anything higher than 30 weight in the A/C engines, only going to 40 weight
if you're driving in extremely hot conditions. )
