Subject:      rough starts

The newest problem my 84 has is starting rough:

Up untill a week ago, it would always start, but for the first 5 minutes,
untill warmed up, it would run really rough.  No exactly like it wasnt
getting gas, I really dont know how to describe it well.  After 5
minutes, it ran good.

Now, if the van sits for a day or so, when i go to start it, the motor
turns over and keeps turning untill I step on the accelerator.  I'm
thinking fuel pump or maybe a small leak somewhere, but i dont see one.
(and, it still starts rough but this problem is new)

Any ideas for either problem???

Thanks, in advance, for any help
