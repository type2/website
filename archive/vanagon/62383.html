Having just returned from Spain, they do indeed have a 5 cyl TDI for the
EV. It will be out in a 110 hp form in October. It's slick, I'm fondling
the brochure as I type.

&gt;&gt; While the best of those TDI motors aren't currently imported to
&gt;&gt;the American continent, at least by crossing the Canadian border and
&gt;&gt;settling for the little 4 cylinder version, you could visit a salvage
&gt;&gt;yard and obtain a genuinely efficient motor.  Getting a 5 cylinder 2.5
&gt;&gt;liter VW/Audi TDI from Europe is my dream for repowering a Vanagon
&gt;&gt;Westy.    &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;I have driven a TDI Passat with the 4 cyl 90 someting HP TDI.  What an
&gt;engine!  What performance!  I have heard a rumour that the 120 HP version
&gt;may be offered in the Eurovan in the next year or two.  Apparently VWs
&gt;problem is that they can not produce TDI motors fast enough to meet the
&gt;demand.
&gt;
&gt;This would be a dream motor in any vehicle.
