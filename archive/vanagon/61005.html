PS. Anybody on the list who knows details about that Concept 2 ?
&gt;&gt;

In Hot VW's a few issues back there were some concept van &quot;retro splittie&quot;
drawings by a man named Steve Stanford. Pretty cool renderings.

VW needs a good kick in the pants and start building this thing. People
wanted the Bug (Concept 1) and they're building it, so why not a concept bus?

p.s. - check out the new issue of &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine - the one w/ the &quot;new
Bug&quot; on the cover- there's a good article on it. The &quot;new Bug&quot; is due out
late next year.

Hi Chris,

the guy who has drawn the new microbus in Gute Fahrt / VW Speed is named Paul 
Barrows.

I fully agree with you - we should have some mailing action to Wolfsburg to 
convince the cowards at VW marketing dept. to launch the project. 

For my part I want it with 
- syncro 16''
- TDI
- large canvas-top 
- or as a Camper !!!

I'll figure out fax number. As soon as I got it i'll be back !!

Tom N.
