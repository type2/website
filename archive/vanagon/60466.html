Subject: Vanagon Starting Problems

Just took off on a weekend trip with the family and the Vanagon started to
snit.  Would not crank with the ignition key until a crawled under the van
and momentarily connected a jumper wire from the starter solenoid
connection to the battery lead.  Once I made that momentary connection, it
would crank and start.  As soon as I shut off the vehicle - same senario.
If I crawled underneath and tickled the starter - works fine until the
next start.  

I recall discussions in the past regarding starting problems, but failed
to pay much attention to them.  After 170,000 miles looks like it's my
turn.  Any assistance is appreciated.

Thanks, Fred
84 Vanagon
