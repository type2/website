I'll translate that for all of the unilinguists we have on the list.

It, of course, means...
	Hannover Itches My Genitals.

I think that it's not a good idea for a sticker as I've found that 
there are many japanese cars with seats which cause my genitals to itch
far more than my van's seats do.
Perhaps the sticker should read
	Hannover' Komfortin  Genetiv
or Hanover is comfortable on my genitals.

sorry, I've started translating german and can't stop.
