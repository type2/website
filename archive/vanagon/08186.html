I converted my wife's Renault 5 headlights from the NA sealed type to the
Euroepean full headlight, the downside was that the bulbs were difficult
to,locate and expensive - the solution? snowmobile 50w-/50w headlight
bulbs from Canadian tire at 5.99 a crack. They are of the exact same
desdign. The implication? Don't be fooled by name brand bulbs or light
fixtures even for VWdubs. DC --
