I'll be signing off the list Friday for a two week vacation in the Canadian 
Rockies. We'll be on the Icefields Parkway between Jasper and Banff most of 
the two weeks. If any of you will be up that way, look for an '87 syncro 
Westfalia, silver with a white top, list sticker in the lower left corner 
of back window.
