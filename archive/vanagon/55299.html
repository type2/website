   I found this condition to be brought on by 1 of 2 things:
      1 - Thermostat opening up to soon, and keeping engine
          to cold.

      2 - NO O2 sensor in the system.

   FIx: Drive Van for 15 min. and made sure temp. gauge is up to
        middle after running hard. This will check temp. Old
        Thermostats gets lazy and tend to run cool.If OK,
        Check wiring to the O2 sensor and the sensor it self.
