Subject: RE:  Good deal?

       Dito to the relpy at the end of this.  I am on the West coast 
     (Oregon) and have also recently been searching for a mid 80's Westy.  
     $4900 for a Westy in good shape--everthing works--is full retail.  You 
     can do better if you shop around.  If you can't wait to shop around, 
     offer them $4900 with the contingincy that they fix the engine &amp; 
     window.
     
     Regards
     Vince.

&gt;       I am looking at purchasing a 1983 Westfalia.  I would appreciate any 
&gt; input on the situation.  
&gt;       The interior is in good shape, body and paint in excellent 
&gt;shape.  The engine is not holding pressure in the third cylinder, and 
&gt;the local VW mechanic estimates $800 to fix.  The odometer doesn't work, 
&gt;but the speedometer does.  A new windshield is needed sometime in the 
&gt;near future, and there is no radio or antenna.  Brakes, tranny (manual), 
&gt;shocks, CV joints, etc. are all in good shape.  The dealer is 
&gt;asking $4900, but said he will take off $800 for the repair of the bad 
&gt;cylinder.  The van has 124,000 miles showing on the non-functional 
&gt;odometer.
&gt;       Is this a decent price considering the condition and age of the 
&gt;van?  FYI I am planning to travel in this vehicle when I graduate in 
&gt;June.  Also, if anyone in the San Luis Obispo, CA area is interested in 
&gt;looking at the van with me, it would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt;Matt  
     
     
Before I respond, I should note that I'm in the Philadelphia area, so my 
comments on Westy values are based on local market conditions.  Perhaps 
prices are substantially higher where you live.  
     
First of all, is this an air-cooled or water-cooled '83?  It was a split 
year.  The water-cooled ones are generally higher in demand, and therefore 
worth more.  If this is air-cooled, the price seems quite high to me.  I've 
seen early 80's air-cooled Westies in nice shape for easily $1000 less. 
     
If it's water cooled, I think the price is still somewhat high, although 
not ridiculous.  First of all, I question how the mechanic can be sure that 
$800 is all it will take to make this motor right, without taking it apart. 
Have he giving you a written quote and a warranty? If you needed a complete 
rebuild, it would certainly cost much more than $800.  And even if he 
guarantees to fix it right for $800, now you've paid $4900 plus the cost of 
a windshield for a bus with God knows how many miles on it.  At least 
around here, $4900 would buy you an '83 or '84 in generally very good 
condition all around, with 125,000 or fewer *actual* miles.  So, based 
solely on the above info, it seems to me the while this may not be a 
terrible deal if everything else in in great shape, I can't say I'd be 
overly excited about it if it were me.  (Then again, as I said, maybe a 
water-cooled Westy is worth that much more in your area.  Maybe some local 
list members could comment on that.)
     
Finding a local list member to look it over with you may not be a bad idea.
