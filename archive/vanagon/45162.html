Subject: Re: Help removing steering wheel



&gt;&gt;and with your thighs pushing up on the
&gt;&gt;wheel, smack it good with a hammer right on the nut.  Repeat as 
necessary.
&gt;&gt;Always worked for me.

Just tried this on my 2 '63 deluxe parts busses.  Neither steering 
wheel budged.  Any other suggestions?
