Well.  Actually, I was thinking about how we needed a group campsong
(Joel, any burning lyrics?  :), but will put that on the back burner
to address this current thing.  How about holding up 2 fingers (like a
peace sign) in the right hand, and 3 fingers in the left?  To the onlooker,
this would make a &quot;V-W&quot; sign.  Might be hard to see while both are
driving, however, especially if there's any tintled glass involved.
