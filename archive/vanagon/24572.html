Subject: 1st campout since rebuilt motor

          this last weekend my son and i took the '66 kombi/camper to
          the oleno, florida &quot;love bug out&quot;.  saturday met up with
          kevin &amp; didi, joe clark from talahassee, and chuck from the
          ocala forest area.  had a good time shooting the breeze,
          looking at each other's photos, books, joe's tent on kevin's
          bus.  we spent the rest of day fishing, taking photos, and
          just relaxing.  the motor is very close to the 1000 mile
          mark now and ran great!  the new cargo doors and crank out
          windows were nice to have, although it did get a bit chilly
          saturday night.  woke up sunday morning with 5 deer grazing
          around the bus.  the kid loved it.  not a huge turnout but a
          friendly one and that's what counts.    ray  thanks to kevin
          for making it happen.
