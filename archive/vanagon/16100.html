Maybe I'll get lucky and find some brake drums at Vallejo this weekend, as I
can't see paying $150/EA when I have the post '64 axles, just will have to pay
to have them rebuilt and installed (about $100 total) as I don't want to open
up my precious tranny on my dirt driveway (no garage available to do the work
in).  But if you come up with anything before that, I'd be glad to here about
it.  Maybe someone out there has a Bentley for Bugs that gives the dimensions
for its brake components (diameter of drum, width of shoes, and diameter/length
of exposed axle shaft) so that I can compare the specs to the ones in my
Bentley for the Bus, which I coughed up $90 for at the San Jose meet and still
think it was worth it.

Thanks,
