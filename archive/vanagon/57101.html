Subject: 2 Qs: source for multimeter US 1119; size of plug for man. tranny





Anyone have any sources for the Multimeter US 1119 as referenced in the
Bentley, and the price range?

When draining and refilling the transmission with gear oil, what is the
size of the hex head wrench that is used?  Is this just a big alan wrench
or is it a special hex head socket or adapter?

Thanks,
Karl
