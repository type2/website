The Eurovan was the lowest-priced car on that list at
23,235.  For that money you could buy the most perfect
condition 23-window deluxe ultra-cool bus and have
money left over for a Karmann Ghia convertible just
in case you ever really wanted to go fast.

Think of the air-cooled fun you could have in the place
of the Roll Royce convertible at almost $300,000!
