Subject: Re: engine substitutions

In the days when I was a 911 owner ('74, the &quot;good&quot; year)
I came across a guy in Costa Mesa, CA who showed me his
nice little vanagon engine conversion.  He shoe-horned
a 911 3.0L into it and said it works fantastically.

He said he had done this to three or four other vanagons,
so if any of you are interested in talking to this guy,
email me directly and I'll give you his name and number.
He's a great guy and has a small under the table outfit.

Hang Loose,
