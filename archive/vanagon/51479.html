&gt; Here's my input on Weekenders.
&gt; 
&gt; VW made a rear seat option that it called the Weekender Package.  It
&gt; consisted of a rear seat that folded down and when combined with the n
&gt; over the engine made a bed.  Sometimes people call the Vanagons with 
&gt; option a Weekender.
&gt; 
&gt; VW made Camper models that had complete kitchen units in them along 
&gt; pop-top.  Usually these were called the Vanagon Camper GL.  Other

I agree with most of this.

And I'll interject as well, I don't believe that VW ever officially
called any Westy a weekender.  Early &lt;71 bays came quite often in either
pop-top or non pop-top form, the non pop-top was simply that maybe some
called it a Weekender.  Now Westy bays also came standard and deluxe,
denoted by equipment and often color, the major differences surfacing
in later years when the Deluxe campmobile had the fridge and propane
stove, the standard having sink only.
Now when Wanagons arrived there were standard and deluxe from Westy
and all pop-top far as I've ever seen in the US (was there ever a
non pop-top Van Westy?, show me pictures) the standards having a
fairly different cabinet layout and sink only, Deluxes full equipment.
Now sometime at the end of the aircooled or with the beginning of
water pumpers there came Weekenders, these featured simply a rear
seat that folded into a bed, the '85 is such.  In the later 80's the
Standard and deluxe (now GL) camper deviated greatly, the rare standard
featuring vary few cabinets and a electric only fridge behind the
passenger but all with pop-tops.  Sometime along there this also started
existing perhaps without fridge as the MV or multi-van but still had a
pop-top?, or perhaps the MV monicker was simply given to the standard
Westy in later years.
Finally into the EV years, early on only the MV bore Westy lineage in
the US, with those nicely done but abhorent to German tadition Winnie
conversions instead, including the monster EV Rialta? is it, only seen
two in my life anyway, but now once again campers emerge from der
Fatherland we hope.
