The way I understand it, retorquing was a feeble attempt by VWoA to solve the 
bad head gasket design problem before they started footing the bill for a lucky 
few that met/meet their &quot;good will&quot; conditions.  I would check with reputable 
VW mechanics for their advice.  I don't think that they'll advise this, 
though.  Let us know what you find out.

Subject: Head Case

After having new heads put on  my 87 Synchro, is there a need to
retorque the heads after a while.  I remember recieving a recall for
this same beloved van that required a retorque.......
Also does anyone make an attractive &amp; functional Brush guard, bumper
enchancer etc.
Also also thanks for the tire advice. Ordered YOKO Y370G  $85 each.
Can't wait to get these slippery Coopers off.
