Subject: scrounging for parts


Hey all you scroungers!  Is there somewhere in FL to do the VW graveyard 
thing?  If not, I've got a couple of small requests I was wondering about.
1.  Screens for side windows, can you find these?
2.  Hinges for back gate, the thing weights about 500 lbs., aand I'm sick 
of holding it on my head whilst looking at the engine.  (I relize I could 
use a stick but....)

Those are the minor things I can think of that I would like to find used, 
also:

3.  Muffler.  Somneone mentioned that the Whitney catalog sold these 
cheap, what's the real scoop?
4.  Tune-up things.  What brands do you prefer?
5.  Antifreeze!!! I'm going searching through the archives for these 
messages, but will happily take replies.

Save space if applicable and send info via email, PLEASE.
