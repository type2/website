Subject: Parade Time - Wanna come?


Well I'm finally getting the 72 back together after a year of being 
driven in partially complete conditioin.  Everything is coming together 
nicely and it looks like I can be in the parade here in Beatrice, NE on 
June 29th in the morning around 9:00.  Now, you know darn well that I 
don't want to be the only one so the invitation is extended.  I have 3 
bugs so far that I have located that can make it.  

I have contacted Matt Joy in Lincoln, NE and just got off the phone with 
him after having a nice long chat.  He referred me to Clark Radcliffe in 
Lincoln who is the VW Club president/coordinator of events guy but when I 
called, his father answered so at this point, I left a message for him to 
get in touch with me.  

Now I think Mr. James Brill is on this list.  You're in Lincoln right?  
If so, how about it?  Wanna join in?  Lemme know.

Also, I forgot who it was, but one of you volks told me that you would 
get me in touch with the Omaha, NE VW Club.  I haven't heard anything 
yet.  Can anyone give me some help here?  Thanks

I would really like to make an impression this year on the community with 
all these VW's.  I would definitely like to see representation of Types 1, 
2, 3, and 4 if possible.  Last year saw 7 VW's but I know this year we 
will be minus 3 from that number due to one gal being gone on vacation 
and one VW is on jackstands. :-( 

So you Bus, Bug, Ghia, Thing, ___back, and TypeIV volks, let me know if 
you'll be able to help me out!

I'd like to note too that the 28thh - 30th of June is Americruise in 
Lincoln, NE at the fairgrounds.  This is a big 3 day event where everyone 
brings their hot-rods, regardless of make or model, and shows them off or 
cruises around town.  That would be great to have a bunch of VW's come 
down for the parade, and then have a big old road rally back to Lincoln.  
Its 4-lane at 65 MPH almost all the way (construction is going on 
but nothing out of the ordinary).

Jist gimme a call if you can attend.
