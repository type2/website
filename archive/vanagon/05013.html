&gt; &gt; By the same token, I woulnd't buy tires that do not inflate to the 
&gt; &gt; pressure recommended on the door frame.  I have a problem now, however, 
&gt; &gt; because the tires I just bought have a max of 50 lbs, and the recommended 
&gt; &gt; is 48.  Is that cutting it close, or is it ok?  With bicycle tires, I 
&gt; &gt; could always inflate to exactly the maximum pressure and it'd be fine. Is 
&gt; &gt; this true of Automobile tires also?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	MAX COLD INFLATION PRESSURE is exactly what it says...and is 
&gt; 	the tire makers recommendation. Whatever it says on the door frame
&gt; 	is the VW recommedation for tires that meet VW's specification for

&gt; 
&gt; 	EXCEEDING the tire manufacturer's recommended MAXimum is a NO NO...

Sorry if this is getting kinda long but what about the tire specified 
for the vehicle?  My door frame says something like 29F and 32R.  Now, 
should I have 35 pound max tires or 40 or 50?  What I mean is, are 
those numbers on the door the posted max pressure for any tire (above 
that rating) or are they the max for only the tire the bus came with? 
Does any of this make sense or, to put it another way, should I care? 
I have 36 max tires on there now inflated to 29 and 32, if I had 45 
max tires should that change?  Signed, Hopelessly Overly Cautious.
