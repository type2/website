&gt;Dubbers:
&gt;
&gt;I have a strange request:
&gt;
&gt;I am getting marrried at the end of August, and I talked my
&gt;fiance to let me put a bug on top of the wedding cake, under
&gt;some conditons:
&gt;
&gt;Between 5 and 10 inches long.
&gt;Convertible
&gt;Bride and goom in the front seat, either driving.
&gt;Can be a Ghia.


Try for nice metal cars from BBurago in most toy stores and KMart, you'll 
need a good toy store to see the full range. Would be cheaper than shipping 
back/forth. 
They are around 8&quot; long. Porsche 356 converti is an excellent model, could 
do in a pinch, just paint a sacriligeous VW logo onto it! tim s.
