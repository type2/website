Subject: SouthWest Bug-In III Oct 20th

Several requests for information has been passed toward VanBondo regarding
the Southwest Bug-In III. Here's the scoop.

What:  Southwest Bug-In III a *VW ONLY event*
Where: Phoenix Raceway Park, Phoenix, Arizona USA. (roughly)
       Specifically closer to the cities of Peoria and SunCity West.
When:  October 20th, 1996
Why:   Not? =)

Directions: Phoenix Raceway Park is located approximately 10-12 miles 
  northwest of Sun City West on Grand Avenue.

  *From Los Angeles: I-10 toward Phoenix until you reach 105th Ave.
   or 99th Ave. Watch for the signs for &quot;Sun City.&quot; Procede north on either 
   99th Ave. or 105th Ave. to the three way intersection of Bell Rd., 99th Ave.,
   and Grand Avenue. Take Grand Avenue toward Wickenburg. Drive about 10-12
   miles while watching for hoards of VWs (Phoenix Raceway Park) on your left.

  *From Albuquerque, Flagstaff etc: Take I-17 south from Flagstaff all
   the way to Bell Road (West) exit. Procede on Bell Rd. to the three way
   intersection of Bell Rd., 99th Ave., and Grand Avenue. Take Grand Avenue

   VWs (Phoenix Raceway Park) on your left.

Specifics: PRA Sanctioned Drags, Show, Swaps, etc. Many categories for the show.
Cost: (I think) $10.00 per person for spectators. Sorry, but I don't know
specifics of swap spaces and drag fees.

More Info: (602)278-VWVW aka (602) 278-8989.

This is supposed to be shaping up to be a great show. The promoter has been
recieving calls from all over. Shoot, it might even be under a zillion
degrees by then! ;-)
