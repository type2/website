What do you mean by &quot;randomly disengage&quot;? Does the clutch slip or is the
transmission popping out of gear?I can not remember ever hearing of a
pilot bearing failing( I am sure they do though).It sounds like the
clutch is not disengaging. Lie under the car while someone pushes on the
clutch pedal. Watch slave actuate the T/O bearing  arm. Is it rotating 
or is it rotating AND moving away from the slave cylinder? Could be a bad
bushing (long shot). Get a little more info and get back with us.
Drive Safely &amp; Good Luck

&gt; when the clutch decided to randomly disengage, usually during 3-2 shift
on a 15% uphill grade... I recalled that the pilot bearing had been done
twice 
&gt;by the PO and started pondering just what the heck it does, and why 
&gt;this $6 part could be causing all this annoyance. 
&gt;Anyway, the problem was worst after 1-2 hrs of hard driving it 
&gt;seemed, but we made it another 300+ kms home with little drama aside 
&gt;from a few missed &quot;speed&quot; shifts.
