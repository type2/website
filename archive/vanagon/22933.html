Subject: RPM gage and fuel pump/line question

hey all,

its me and my 73 camper again!

ok, so things are going ok, but i have yet another question.  lots of
talk and things i read about RPMs, but my bus doesn't have a little
RPM gage.  how hard would it be to put one of these things on?  anyone
do it and want to throw some advice my way?  

by the way, found that terrible clicking noise, and yes it was the
fuel pump (tons of fun finding it:)  i have two questions about it.

1) when you put one of these things on is it customary to rework the
way the gas goes?  the original fuel lines are just snipped and
plugged up.

2) if i replace the pump will it stop constantly clicking?  or is that
just a price i must pay?

thanks everyone!  take care,

		brandy
