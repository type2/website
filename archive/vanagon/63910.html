&gt; 
&gt; --------------
&gt; 	Could some one please point me to the cooling system flushing and
draining
&gt; in the Bentley book for an 86 westy.I have found the bleeder valve in the
&gt; engine compartment and the one on top of the radiator,the 2 engine head
&gt; drain plugs.What is confusing me is in the Bentley after removing the
head
&gt; drain plugs page 19.15 the manual seems to go into a rant about removing
&gt; the engine and clamping off hoses.Now all I want to do is flush out the
old
&gt; and install some new.Filling the cooling system page 19.16 seems straight
&gt; forward enough and should be no problem.
&gt; 	There is a lot of cooling system information in the archive,but none
seems
&gt; to cover draining of the system.After reading through the archive it is
&gt; unclear which hoses need to be pulled if any.  tia
