Subject: Office Odyssey stopped by /f

The couple from the Office Odyssey stopped in to see us a week ago 
and they wrote up the web page from the visit.

See:

Also, we were in St. Croix and I saw 2 buses (1 needed to be rescued) 
and a Vanagon.  Got pictures of the buses, but not the Vanagon.

Regards,
