&gt; One thing I noticed and forgot to mention in the Gerbil update is an

&gt; with the rear deck... [snip]
&gt; In any case, in addition to the two holes for the fresh air
&gt; ducts, and the half-circle things that go fit up around the heat riser
&gt; tubes, are two more holes.  They're about two-thirds the diameter of
&gt; the fresh air holes, and are slightly to the rear (FIF) and closer to
&gt; the midline than the fresh air holes.  Any idea what these might be?
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is that they are for a later-model bus that has some sort of
&gt; emission-control plumbing, but that's purely a guess.  My current plan
&gt; is to cover them with duct tape, since all they're doing right now is
&gt; allowing used engine air back into the engine compartment.

I've got a set of holes as you describe in the rear engine tin on my '76 
FI 2.0 L.  I haven't a clue what they're for (my guess was something to 
do with A/C, which my bus doesn't have).  I hose-clamped several sheets 
of tin foil over the holes to keep exhaust gases and road dust from 
getting sucked back up into the engine.
