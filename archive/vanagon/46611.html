This brings up a question I've been mulling over. Can a cat be 
effectively added to an older bus and significantly improve 
emmissions, assuming the engine is well tuned? I imagine type 4 
engines should be easier since the a/c Vanagons had cats (I think), 
but what about the T1s? Are any of the currently produced a/c vws in 
the world sold with cats?
