Subject: Re: Importing brand-new VWs to US


&gt;It's REAL tough to bring in VWs made recently in, say, Brazil or Mexico.
&gt;Emissions eqpt. non-compliance is only part of the problem. There are also
&gt;requirements (Either 50-state or Federal, I'm not sure) for a host of other
&gt;things, such as taillight size/shape, bumpers, crash beams in doors, airbags/
&gt;seat belts, trans locks for automatics, bigger brakes, etc., etc.

don't forget safety glass....
