All this talk about the abundance of Westies has prompted me to inquire
about strange Westfalias, especially in Europe.  Down the block from
me lives a guy who owns a golf, a 70s Westy, and a largish Mercedes
van, with a Westfalia top on it.  It even has the same font that VW
uses.  Is &quot;Westfalia&quot; a generic term for camper, like &quot;Winnebago&quot; is
a generic term for large, lumbering house-on wheels driven by half-blind
and nearly deaf retirees?

I've been meaning to stop by my neighbor, and make him show me the inside
of this Mercedes Westfalia, but lately he seems to have gone on an extended
road trip in it.
