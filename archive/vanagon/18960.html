Subject: The Parts Place (re: '82 heads)

Someone asked me a few weeks ago about the phone number
for the Parts Place and unfortunately I lost their mail.
Since I had left my new catalog at my folks home and
because the only old one I had had the wrong number,
it's taken me till now to get it.

The number is (810) 373-2300 FAX (810) 373-5950

and regarding the heads in discussion at the time, this all
new catalog list new '79-'83 071-101-061 heads for $350
as I had thought and remanufactured for $230.  Again in
my experience these guys never sell junk so I figure the
new heads to be OEM or equal though someone should call
to find where they are made.
