&gt;Is there any consensus on this?
&gt;
&gt;Also... 
&gt;1.   The sliding door is having trouble latching. The door fits fine and
&gt;there is no body damage.  Bently does not address this, any ideas?  
&gt;2.  Besides the oily rag and light oil lube per Bently, where, and with what
&gt;do you lube in the door mechanism.  What parts need to be inspected.
&gt;3.  Can seatbelt retractors be lubricated, or should they only be replaced?
&gt;
&gt;

Peter,

I drive 195s on my 85 westy and have been quite pleased with the smooth ride.
 I think I'm going to 205s next time.  I would like the extra stability.  The
wind REALLY is starting to bug me.

I seem to recal there was a recal on the sliding door latch.  I'll try to
attach the file to this message.  Mine does the same thing but I just haven't
had time to take it to the dealor (ick).  I find that if I can't get the door
to stay closed when I slam it, I just close it gently and it stays.

BTW,  I susbscribe to Smithsonian.  I'll look for you article.
