While on the subject of neglect and frozen brake drums, if anyone plans on 
leaving
their Bus parked for a while(maybe as little as a couple of weeks) should 
block the wheels with chokes or bricks or whatever and leave the parking 
brake off.  This may not be important in dry climates but in rather moist 
climates you would be surprised at how quickly moisture and brake dust can 
combine to produce a very strong bond.
Took me about 20 minutes alternating between 1st and reverse to get the 
brakes to release.  Just my $.02.
