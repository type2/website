Subject: The Syncro and the Snow

Hello Volks,
	Snowing here in northern Michigan today. Started this morning, was raining
last nite. The well head is now covered up, this morning about 4&quot; were
showing and it's still coming down.
	Had to go driving this morning, around town stuff, drop off the wife at
work, pick up a daughter at a friends and do that last minute shopping. For
around town stuff I usually use the $100 honda (that's what it's for). Went
out in the honda this morning, it did not take long to realize I should
have taken the bus! Went home and changed cars, the '86 syncro is made for
snow. Did the rest of the running around, The syncro works great! It had
been awhile since I had to drive in the snow, ice and slush, comfortable
and smooth. I have had it slide on ice in past years but in this type of
weather the bus can't be beat. 
	Going from the honda to the VW the differences were noticeable. 
	I just had to tell someone.
	Thanks for listening. 
	Merry Christmas to all and to all a good VW kind of day.

	Rob
