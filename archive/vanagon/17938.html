&gt; Can someone clue me in on what a &quot;type II&quot; is ?

A type II in the VW world is what all the bus generations are refered to 
as.  But there are generation numbers as well.  The newest generation is 
called Eurovan in America, and T4 in Germany.  So I would take that to 
mean that the four generations of type IIs are refered to thusly:
 
T1: Split windshield bus
T2: Bay window bus (aka, breadloaf)
T3: Vanagon
T4: Eurovan

&gt; I suspect that there are &quot;body type I, II, III...&quot; and
&gt; &quot;engine type I, II, III, IV, ...&quot;.

Just covered the body type.  The engine type is easier.  type IIs used 
type I engines up to 1971 in the USA.  The engine called type I because 
it's the same as a Bug (type I) engine.  From 1972-1984? an air-cooled 
engine refered to as a type IV was used, and after that is 
water-cooled... so i don't care.  :)

&gt; I can see that I have to build a table of engine types versus model
&gt; years to keep this straight. &quot;I am only an egg.&quot;

I think someone has a definition table somewhere.

&gt; I think the original distiction was between the &quot;small window Bug = type I&quot;
&gt; body, and &quot;Split screen breadbox = type II&quot; body. But there seem to be many
&gt; more variations to account for.

Umm... kinda.  There are alot of dfferent models within each type and 
year.
