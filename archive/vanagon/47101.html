Subject: Re: Catalytic Conv Gaskets (Was muffler)

In a message dated 96-07-20 20:03:38 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Thanks for sending the parts info.  One question, does the converter come 
 with two regular gaskets?  I looked at a local after market converter, 
 and there was on regular gasket in the box and one doughnut metal 
 gakset.  Is this what yours comes with?  (This is for an '87 by the 
 way.)  The bentley manual shows two regular gaskets that fit on the 
 triangular 3 bolt flange.  Any thoughts on this? &gt;&gt;

Gaving recently sold a converter for a 86 Syncro (same cat as yours), the
aftermarket cats come with one of each.  I've let the MFR know that 86-87
models with the Original Collector Pipes used triangular gaskets on both
ends, but it remains to be seen if they'll supply them that way in the
future.  They don't like adding anything that may unnecessarily increase the
price and have anything left over for those that don't need the part.
 Suggestion:  buy the cat with the two different gaskets, buy the extra
triangular gasket as I mentioned in the earlier post and keep the doughnut
metal gasket for when the time comes to replace the Collector Pipe - you'll
need it then (VW and we get almost $12 for this doughnut - expensive, but can
only get from Germany at this time).  If you buy the VW Dealer Converter, you
don't get any gaskets and pay 4 times as much for the converter.  Converter
Part Number is VAG 025-131-701 - fits 86-91 models.
