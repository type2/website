Subject: 87GL Running Hot

I just recently returned my 87GL to an original exhaust system.  PO had
installed generic junk welded in place.  May be just concidence but now the
van is running hotter.  Temp indicator is just on the hi side of the
blinker.  Anyone have an explanation why a new muffler would cause
increased running temp?  Should I be looking elswhere for a problem or is
this not even a problem?
