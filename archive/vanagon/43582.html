Subject: Fuel Injection - help with hoses

I'm adding the last few accessories to the '76 pop-top's engine I've 
been rebuilding over the last couple of months.  Having never worked 
on a FI engine, I was anxious about geting all the electrical 
connections right.  Well, with the Bently's book, the electrical 
system was the easy part.   Now, I'm worried about all those 
hoses...

In particular, I've got a &quot;T&quot; shaped part that threads into the left case half 
(just under the intake air distributer) with an allen head.  It has 
a small diameter hose comming off one end, and a rubber nipple on the 
other.  What is it???  I'm pretty sure it really goes into the case, 
because the tinware was shaped perfectly for it.  I'm also pretty 
sure the threaded end was solid, so perhaps it's  some sort of temp 
sensor, or (fuel?) pressure release valve.  Any hints?

Also, where do the distrubutor's vaccuum hoses connect to?

Specifically, this engine has an electrically controlled EGR, and no 
throttle microswitch.

Thanks in advance
