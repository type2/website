Subject: Inuvik update

Well, here's where we stand with the Inuvik trip...

   o  Volkswagen is offering all drivers out of Vancouver an oil &amp; oil
      filter change and spare air filter.  Those who want to change their
      own oil will get the oil filter to use.

   o  There will be 13 drivers out of Vancouver, with 10 more joining us
      along the way to Inuvik.

   o  We've gotten some stories posted on our web site
      (http://www.chaco_dot_com/inuvik), and we'll be posting more as they
      arrive.  Anyone going along may send stories from the road.

   o  I'll be adding a discussion area for folks following along from
      home.

If you have any thoughts for making the web site more interesting, please
let me know.

Ron
