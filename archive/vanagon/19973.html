Dave Carment wrote, about replacing windshields:

&gt;PS Our insurance policy will cover the cost of replacement save 50
&gt;deductible. I would rather not have this done because of the way 
&gt;the windshield is affixed to the frame. A less than competent job 
&gt;could result in leaks.

I've just had the windshield replaced on my '90, after looking at 
stars for nearly two years. One star recently spread down to the 
edge (6-7 inches) so I gave up and called the insurance company. 
You're not in bad shape with a 50 deductible: mine was 120. The 
total cost was about $210! Ouch! Regarding possible leaks, the guy 
who installed the new glass put a small bead of black silicon around 
the outside glass/rubber edge. He said VW vans do sometimes lead 
after new windshields are installed, not at the rubber/metal 
interface, but the rubber/glass. He said that a good seal would form 
within a month or so, and then I could peel off the silicon. I 
wouldn't let the leak potential stop me from replacing a cracked 
(and getting worse) piece of glass that sits just in front of my 
face. Just one opinion.
