&gt; Getting a Vanagon Westfalia Syncro GL sounds great, though I doubt I could
&gt; find one.  Do the Syncros get lousy mileage?
&gt; 
Hi Ron.  I get 23-24 mpg (imperial) with or without the a/c on.  It's 
very consistent.  That is highway mileage.  I don't use the van in 
town, so can't tell you that.  Ours is a '90 Syncro Westy, and has 
been really good to us... except for engine waterpumps (on 3rd one 
now, all on warranty).

Syncro traction is unbelievable.  Canadian models all came with the 
differential lock, and this is highly recommended (I believe it was 
an option in the US).

Harry.
