Subject: Rearview mirror mounts-Baywindow

I need to know how to remove the rearview mirror from the 
cieling of the '71 bus I have. Is it pried, pulled, twisted,
what?

Also, how do I remove the mirror from the stem? Just yank it
out, or pry it. Can I heat the plastic body with a hair-dryer 
or hot water?

(I got one of the extended rearviews and want to put it into my '71 Bus)

Thanx.
