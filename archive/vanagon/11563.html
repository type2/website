&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Has anyone ever went to a job interview drving their breadloaf?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I did.  Guess what kind of job I tried to get with my '74 beast?
&gt; Yup.  A *car* salesman.  :-)  Needless to say, they just looked
&gt; at me funny and said,   &quot;Sure, we'll CALL you.&quot;.  I suppose I
&gt; should have tried at a VW dealership and not at a big 3...
&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;  :)

I had an interview with a Ford vehicle prep company back in '85. I drove a
72 bus.  I felt I was not going to get the job because I had an import.
Later, after getting the job, I noticed that most of the employees drove
GMs and Dodges.  I was the only one that drove imports (bus, volvo and
vanagon).  I guess they hired all kinds...
