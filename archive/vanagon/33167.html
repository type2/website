Subject: Re: Electronic Rustproofing unit

About these electronic rust protection devices:

I purchased and installed this.

I believe it does nothing. This is based on engineer's reports that say you
have to be parked in a filled swimming pool with lots of salt in the water
for this to have any effect at all.

On the other hand, what is the Northeast in winter but a water/salt mixture.

Still, I don't think it has any effect.

I bought the costly 4 module version and it was time consuming to install.
The people who own the company told my Datsun 510 fanatic friend Steve
Joseph (author of a book on rustproofing) that the 4 module version is no
advantage over the two modeule version but they included it because JCW
asked them to &quot;for marketing purposes,&quot; that is, so they could rake in more
dough. My guess is that the total manufacturing cost of these parts, taken
together, based on their appearance, is about $2.50.

I think GM engineers studied these things and determined that they would
have no effect if GM was to install them in their vehicles. I think they
said that to supply them with enough current to be effective would bring
about so much current that it could damage the paint on the car, or
something like that. The exception would be parking in the salt water
swimming pool mentioned above. 

Since I feel like I am driving around in a salt water swimming pool these
days with all the snow/melt/salt, and I have my magic protection, I feel
good.  :-)

&gt;Hey now,
&gt;        Just saw an electronic rustproofing unit in the JCW catalog.
&gt;Anybody know if it works? Kinda pricey at $149-179, but if it can fight
&gt;cancer, it may just be worth it. So is this snake oil or god's gift to
&gt;VW's?
&gt;
