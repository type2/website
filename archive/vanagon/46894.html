&lt;&lt;        While in Pep Boys the other day getting oil I noticed something
 called Water Wetter. It claimed that it reduced engine temperatures by
 increasing the the ability of the coolant to transfer heat from the engine.
 It also said that it lubed the water pump and prevented corrosion. It was a
 pink solution that appeared to be carbonated (I dropped it on the floor).
 Has anyone ever heard of this stuff? &gt;&gt;

Dave, I never have, but point of caution.......what is the pH of this stuff?
VW specifically warns against phophate-type anti-freezes because they
eventually cause corrosion to the aluminum heads. How about this stuff? It's
a pretty expensive mistake from what I understand if you have to replace the
heads.

Also in another post someone mentioned Sierra anti-freeze, which is propylene
glycol instead of ethylene glycol. Does anyone know for sure if it's safe on
vanagons and Westfalias?
