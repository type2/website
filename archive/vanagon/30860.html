Subject:       Roof Rack for Sale

FOR SALE:


An aluminum German made after market roof rack that will fit both
70's style busses and Vanagons.  I made bolt on extensions so it 
would fit the wider Vanagons.  Paid over $200.00 new.  Will ship, if 
willing to pay freight. 

It clamps over the gutters.  Will hold about 300 lbs.  
It's light weight but strong.  The clamps have rubber coatings so it 
won't scratch the paint.  I used it one summer - 30 days while camping in 
Europe. 

It's in perfect shape.  It covers about 1/3 of the top of the 
bus/Vanagon.  One could paint it to match their van.

Telephone: (601) 325-1908 work
                   (601) 324-1739 home.
