Subject: Re: Side window screens?

Don,

The window screens for vanagons fit inside. The top and
one side edge fit into the window frame and the bottom 
edge has two plastic prongs that snap into the window
frame. I understand that they cost ~$90 a pair at the 
dealer, ouch =:o  I don't know if any of the catalogs
carry them. Cheese has a more cost effective solution
but I don't know if I would drill holes in the body.

I like em, but the prongs have broken off of one of the
frames so it doesn't stay put. Somehow I'll have to fix 
this.
