&gt; radio and loose. An experience to avoid.

I've spoken to a broker about doing the reverse trip; Europe to US 
and back again.  They _strongly recommend_ shipping the vehicle 
inside a 20' ISO freight container rather than ro-ro for precisely 
the sort of reason that Tim mentions.  Only customs get their 
hands on the vehicle.  Ro-ro is somewhat cheaper, but you could end 
up paying a lot more to straighten out the resultant damage.
