&gt; I've seen some buses around that have a high roof.  Not a pop-top, but an
&gt; entire raised roof (about a foot and a half or so).
&gt; 
&gt; How can I install something like this on my hardtop '79?  Anybody got any
&gt; info on the conversion?  How does it affect gas mileage?  How much does it
&gt; cost (if I do it mostly myself) and who makes it?

I have one and I like it.  I don't think it hurts gas mileage too much,
but I really don't have much to compare it against.  I get 19-20 mpg
just like all of the other busses of my era.  I think installing one
would be pretty straightforward, but I don't think I would attempt it,
since it involves cutting the roof.  I'd just find one that was already
done.  I noticed that I was the only bubble top bus at BBTA, which seems
wierd since there are so many here in California.
