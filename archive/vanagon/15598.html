Subject: Re: Vanagon Head Gaskets

Good point on changing the antifreeze frequently....I changed mine about
every 2.5 years using phosphate-free and still had the leakage. Should do it
more often. In fact I should be out there doing it right now since time has
slipped away and it's already been 2 yrs 2 mos since last change! Guess
that'll be the next job after getting cv-joint and front wheel assembly back
together. Front final drive's gotta be worked into the sheme of things too.
All this just to avoid a car payment!

The heads I've seen with corrosion have pitting all over the inside face of
the head wherever the coolant comes in contact. It looked to me more like
aluminum deterioration than it did destruction of the gasket. Whatever the
case, the antifreeze change (using phos-free like Joel said) has got to be
the best insurance.
