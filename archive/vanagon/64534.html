Subject:      Any Books on European Camping

My wife and I are toying with the idea of spending the summer (june, July
and August (assuming we can avoid the high tourist areas) bumming around
Europe in a camper (VW of course). We figure we could start in the
Netherlands or northern Germany then work down the
Rhine..Munich...Switzerland, across the south of France to Spain and
Portugal and eventually north back thru France, etc...

Anywho...anyone out there know of a good guide or book on camping in Europe
and or listings of European campgrounds?

Thanks.

Ric
