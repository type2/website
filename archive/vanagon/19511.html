&gt;  I'll step into the breech &lt;briefly&gt; and say that, while my exposure to the
&gt;  EV is limited, I have been mostly impressed. This is an EV MV owned by
&gt;  parents of a kid on Max's soccer team. I've ridden in the EV to several 
&gt;  distant games and find it comfortable. It seems to have quite adequate  
&gt;  acceleration and hill climbing ability, certainly way better than my
&gt;  1800 cc '74. I think that the 5 spd gearbox gives it a nice &quot;long-legged&quot;
&gt;  feel on the highway. The engine noise is audible as a &quot;growl&quot; when the
&gt;  vehicle is accelrating or climbing but is reasonably quiet on level ground.
&gt;  The noise I found annoying was the amount of tire noise transmitted into the
&gt;  vehicle interior. This particular EV has been on several major road trips
&gt;  &lt;Germany, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands Germany and U.S coast to coast&gt;. They
&gt;  say it has been very reliable and they love the thing.

Any idea what the tire brand is?  I've got Goodyear tires and don't have 
any complaints about the tire noise.  On my little S10 I went from decent 
tires to crappy tires and the tire noise is horrendous.  Nre tires are 
Firestone and they are bad for traction and noise.  The Goodyears on the 
EV seem plenty fine to me.  I guess I really like a 'sportscar-like' 
growl in an engine - kind of get that feel in the EV.

&gt;  Interestingly, in this area the asking price for a used '93 EV is usually
&gt;  several thousand dollars less than for a '91 Vanagon! Perhaps EVs will
&gt;  become a used car bargain.

That is pretty bizarre.
