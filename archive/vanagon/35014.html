Subject: 61 Westy interior

Help!
  I was wondering if anyone would tell me how to replace the paneling 
inside my 61 Westy? The wood bows are ready to go up but what do they 
attach to along the top?  Do I need to put any insulation up  first and 
if so what type?

The submarine hatch has 4 bolts coming from the hinges. What do these go 
through and how should it be secured? Does anyone have blueprints? 
drawings would work just fine as I have no idea how this things are 
suppose to go together. Should I put insulation along the sides too?
What kind of screws should I use for the panels?

The interior looks just like Allen Henry's 61 (Aug93HVW) (he has sold it 
since then). Anyone know where I could get his address?
Thanks
Larry
