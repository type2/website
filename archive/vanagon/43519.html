&gt; While we're on the topic, does anyone have any info on using a VW engine

&gt; of the spark plug holes and inflate a tire (without hurting your engine)?

  My housemate was given one of these gadgets. I don't think it had 
  ever been used, it was still in a pristine box and complete with 
  instructions. The drawings on the front made it look like it was
  produced sometime in the 60s (I suppose there would have been 
  a date on the instructions but I forgot to look). 
 
  I was all for giving it ago, but my housemate took it to one of 
  VW meets last summer and sold it to a stall selling old(ish) 
  accessories.  

  There wasn't alot to it though, it wouldn't be hard to make. However, a 
  more modern version I've seen around plugs into your cigarette lighter/
  silver socket and powers a very small compressor to inflate your tyre.
  Its bloody noisy and takes ages to get the tyre to a reasonable psi. A 
  footpump and handheld gauge is probably still the best way to go.
