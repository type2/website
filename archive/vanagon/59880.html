Well, I sure hated to lose my trusty engine.  Already had the head job
done.  It ran really well.
Kmart said they would take care of it.  Right.  They wouldn't pop for a
rebuild or a new engine.  Their adjuster found a used engine in a junk
yard.  (Hmmm, just occured to me that I'm not really sure which engine
size it is... think it is the 1.9 but it came out of a later model than
my 83.)  Not sure how many miles on it, but it had good compression.  My
mechanic did not bother to change exaust system, and this one is about
to go.  Probably from sitting on the ground in an open junk yard for a
couple of years.  Other than that it runs good, 02 sensor is shot.
As for lawsuits, they are a hasle and not profitable.  Drunken lawyers
eat up so much you are lucky indeed to come out whole.  I was rear ended
4 yrs ago, have spent close to  $20,000, still need a $25,000 neck
operation, still in pain, still in court with Farmers (they offered
$30,000).  Whatever I get will be deminished by lawyer (40%). Ugh.
