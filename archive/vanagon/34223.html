&quot;Okay, I take this as a challenge.  I say Martha 'Not to be out-done' Rubin
can put together a trip where we can actually traverse the Atlantic Pond to
the UK on pontoons!  Well Martha?  ;)&quot;

Ahem.  Well, Ratboy, as a matter of fact, I've been pondering this inconvenient
limitation for some time now.  Besides, do you think I ever do anything with
my time other than plan the next camping trip?  Here's my proposal:

If all of us could put together a rig attaching a boat to our vans, but
so that either could tow the other (the van towing the boat on land, and
the boat somehow carrying the van on water, obviously), then we could
literally go anywhere!  I haven't been able to solve yet the dilemma
of how to carry enough fuel in either/both to make the trip, but I'm
working on some slightly volatile experimentation involving a magnesium
powered engine with a roman candle exhaust (come to the party Saturday
nite and see it first hand in my living room).  If I could just figure
out how to turbo-charge it with a little nuclear fission, I don't
see why we all couldn't simply go ANYWHERE on a trip, no?

For that matter, Ratboy, you've opened up my thinking on this:  why limit
ourselves to 2-D?  Fess up - wouldn't you rejoin the CCC's if we were
going to the moon?  Or 5-D!:  I always wanted to travel faster than the
speed of light.  :)
/m   :)
