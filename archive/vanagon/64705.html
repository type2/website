Subject:      Re: Vanagon/Transporter

&gt; And in South Africa 'Microbus' and 'Kombi'.  Are these the original
&gt; German names - Helmut?

Right, they are type definitions, not actually listed on the back of the
busses.

The Microbus is the real passenger model. The Kombi is the 8/9 seater
commercial vehicle with detachable benches. Meant for contracters etc, so
it can be used to transport personnel as well as goods.
