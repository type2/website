To All:

While several of the firewall/fuel tank bulkhead fasteners were obvious on
the '72 I'm working on, two of them were not.  They were inserted from below
the vehicle, up through openings in the transmission mount.  I've seen two
examples of '72's.  Both were the same in this regard and I assume it is the
standard method of firewall installation.
