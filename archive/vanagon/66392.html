Subject:      My temp light is flashing

Hey folks
        I finally made the leap and bought a 85 westie auto on saturday.
Sunday the family and I take the van for a 100 mi drive around the area.
During the drive the temp indicator is right on the lower edge of the LED
and we are driving in the hills of western maine.  When I was starting the
van after stops for gas etc. the light would stay on for up to 45 seconds or
a minute then go out.  It never came on during hard driving or high speeds.
At the last stop for supper it came on and stayed on (flashing).  I have
been checking the coolant all day and it hasn't moved on the refill tank,
right at max.  The other tank is completely full without a bubble or
anything.  Anybody have any ideas??
        Thanks in advance for any help offered, it may save my marriage.
Thanks,
Stephen Davis
