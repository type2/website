Subject: re:My Tank Runnith Over

&gt; Just over half way through the fill up, I heard what sounded linke a 
&gt; waterfall under the Van, so being the curious type I stopped filling to 
&gt; take a look. Sure enough there was a waterfall or should I say gasfall 
&gt; running out from somewhere above the middled of the van where the tank 
&gt; is. Yikes!

Double Yikes!!

The same thing happened to me soon after I bought my '81 Vanagon. I had 
to drop the tank (after draining of course) and take it to ye olde local
radiator 
repair shoppe to be fixed. 

The tanks in these things are a little deformed on top. It looks like
somebody took a sledge and beat a valley in the center of the tank.
My leak was in that little valley and the joe at the shop pointed 
out that the tank had been patched in that same spot before. He was able 
to fix it and I haven't heard that lovely sound of my hard earned dough
pouring 
onto the pavement at the local shell station.
