Helmut,

I have a question that maybe you can help me with.  I'm under the
impression that you're in Germany, if so this is where you can be a real
help.  Of course if you're not...I feel rather dumb. ;)

When I was in Berlin in the summer of '95 I saw a couple of interesting
light set-ups on Vanagons.

I saw late model vans ('86 and up) with round headlights (in the US they
would've been rectangular) that weren't the normal 7&quot; (18 cm ?) but much
larger like 9&quot; (23 cm).  I saw these on all the police and ambulance Vans
as well as regular Vans.  What were these lights, and are they available as
a modification?  Or are they a government only type option.

A second set-up had the  normal round head lights but with driving lights
in the grille similar to the later model GTI's (up to '91).  Do you know
anything about these?

Both of these would be great light upgrades so any info would be really
helpful.  I'll be back in Europe this summer, but it's hard for me to get
good info since I don't speak German.

Thanks

James
