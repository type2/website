Subject: Re: Diesel syncro?

Gary inquired:
&gt;&gt; Can anyone tell me if there were any diesel syncros ever made?  I believe
the
&gt;&gt; diesel Vanagons were last made in about 82' and that syncros began
production
&gt;&gt; in about 86'. Any thoughts?
 
Peter responded:
 &gt;Hello Gary! In europe transporter syncro pickup singlecab/crewcab was 
 &gt;aviable with 1.6 litre turbodiesel. Both 14 and 16 inch wheel versions 
 &gt;had this engine. 

Gary,
I'm going to guess that you're inquiring about Vanagons in the USA.  In the
USA the diesel engine was an option in 1982 &amp; 1983.  The Syncro models were
available 1986 to 1991 except 1988.  Thus no diesel Syncros in the USA -
except for home conversions maybe.
