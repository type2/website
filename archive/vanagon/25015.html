Subject: RE:Power brakes [was idle problems]

&gt;Well, I thought all the '71 Buses had power front disc brakes. Every 
&gt;one I've seen has them, any way. But I admit I am not an authority on 
&gt;the subject-- anyone ever seen a '71 bus WITHOUT power front discs?
&gt;Maybe drums, or nonpower discs?

    - I checked the van and it definitely doesn't have the power 
brakes. I then checked the Haynes manual for the van, apparently in 
the UK after 1971 the brake servo was fitted as an optional extra. 
Obviously the original owner opted not to bother, which is a shame 
really as I wouldn't mind that extra bit of braking power.

                        Cheers
                                Jon
