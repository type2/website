Subject: never too old to learn

	So after wisely noting that one should check CV joint bolts
after a few hunnert miles, in case some grease got between the
joint and the cup it attaches to and subsequently got slung out,
DID I actually check mine? (Little Martha, '70 single cab)
	No.
	Suddenly I started hearing the funny periodic noise - shunk-a-shunk-a
shunk-a, which decreased when I slowed down. Hmm. pull off the freeway,
inspect the tires and wheels. Nothing. Start up again. Shunk-a-shunk-a etc.
Pull off again. Check the axles this time.
	One CV bolt was entirely gone, a second no-longer
threaded into anything, and the funny two-bolt-washer was sticking
out like the whirling-cythe-of-death. It had snagged the wires that
run from and to the reverse switch on the tranny, and they were
wrapped around the axle, striking the body when the axle got
going fast enough. 
	Bummer.
	One other bolt was loose, the rest tight, by finger as I
lay under the car on the side of 280...

	So, other wise-guy home mechanics, go check your CV bolts.
No doubt I'm the only one to have the problem, but it is nice
to be able to share. :)

	Guess I add that allen key to the 10mm, 13mm, 15mm, 17mm and 19mm
wrenches I always carry.

	Bill
