&gt; Other insulation ideas for happier campers:
&gt; 
&gt; --------Buy a 4 x 8 sheet of styrofoam wall insulation. Pop top and place
&gt; across roof area, leaving access space for the hold down handles,  &amp; kick
&gt; stands. Cut slot for pull down handle. Fit to roof when pop top is raised.
&gt; (This really cuts air entering from top.)

There is also foil backed fiberglass stuff called cylotex.  It comes in
various thicknesses from 1/4&quot; to 2&quot;  

I am trying to find it myself to use to insulate the engine compartment and 
apron.  THe heat from the exhaust ruined the paint on my apron :(

The local stores only have 1&quot; - I want 1/2&quot;
