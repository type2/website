&gt; &gt;&gt; My, how PC.  Who am I to buck this ever-so-benificent trend?

I can't think that there is a problem with referring to folks in the way
that they have become accustomed to being referred.  If the people up in
Detroit Lakes prefer this terminology, what exactly is *wrong* with it?  I
hate to see the list denegrated by this sort of mean-spirited humor.

&gt; &gt;sure, I'll have a go...
&gt; &gt;how about if we refer to those who have a problem with &quot;the PC BS&quot; as
&gt; &gt;&quot;compassion compromised&quot;?
&gt; &gt;dave &quot;mean spirited humor intolerant&quot;

If you can't see the difference in the reference to an attitude you have
&quot;chosen&quot; to a circumstance &quot;not chosen&quot; then I am hard pressed to know what
to think.  The fact of the matter is that very few groups apply such
terminology to themselves.  For instance, if the people we used to refer to
as &quot;midgets&quot; find this terminology degrading, what skin is it off your nose
to recognize (if not cooperate with) that they prefer the term &quot;little
people&quot; (contrary to what you may think, they have not requested to term
&quot;altitudinally challenged&quot;--this was a term assigned to them in humor by one
of the Limbaugh types somewhere along the line).

Gee, Steve, why don't you just call me &quot;faggot?&quot;
