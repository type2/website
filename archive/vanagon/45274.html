Subject: EV Fan Resistor Update


I just purchased a spare set of fan resistors for my EV...interestingly 
enough the ones I had in the EV were part number 701 959 263 B and the new 
ones were 701 959 263 D. The old ones had a very fine, multiple wire 
coil...the new ones have a heavy wire coil with about 1/2 the windings of 
the original &quot;B&quot; version.

It seems to me that VW has been having problems with these things burning 
up...all considering that I purchased the &quot;B&quot; resistors last July and now 11 
months later they have a &quot;D&quot; version.
