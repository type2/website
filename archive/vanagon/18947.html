Well this is a waste of bandwidth but I'd really like to
thank everyone again as the results have made me so happy
I've got to share em with someone (you unfortunately for you all)
thanks to the help I have now added

&quot;maker of precision displacement transducers&quot; to my abilities,

in fact if anyone ever needs a bargain basement $20 displacement
transducer, (reuseable extensometer type, rivaling $200-$2000 
commercial models), hopefully fatigue rated, (crossing my fingers),
with a precision of somewhere between .00001&quot; and .0001&quot; give me
a call, in fact give me a job and I'll make em for you.  Anyway
thanks again everyone, this might finally put me near the end of
a too long MSME.
