&gt;&gt;Weel, I'm no DDDDoctor, bbbbbut try this favorite nostrum of mine.  For
&gt;&gt;some years now I have paid for a diagnosis only when I'm stumped.
&gt;&gt;Usually this is my strategy. Determine the best place to get a correct
&gt;&gt;answer.  Your expensive guy seems to be an ok candidate.  Check the
&gt;&gt;yellow pages under Auto Repair Electric.  Often you'll find several very
&gt;&gt;competent technicians, some  who use an electronic diagnostic and
&gt;&gt;troubleshooting service called &quot;Alldata&quot;. Call first tell them you'd like
&gt;&gt;for them to &quot;diagnos xyz problem&quot; and ask how much they would charge.
&gt;&gt;Typically a 1/2 hour minimum is standard. I'v never paid more than $30,
&gt;&gt;and feel it is well worth the cash. If you can't locate the above by
&gt;&gt;yellow pages, I've called several gas stations,since these guys routinly
&gt;&gt;need this type of help and asked &quot;whos the best at xyz?&quot; This protocol
&gt;&gt;has also located quite a few genuine gurus in not so well published
&gt;&gt;places.  Lastly call the closest auto repair school,and speak to an
&gt;&gt;instructor.  I found one of these guys working PT in a gas station and he
&gt;&gt;was Mahvaleous! So I hope these are of some value? Note: the alldata
&gt;&gt;system tracks maintainance and diagnostic information from a variety
&gt;&gt;professional sources, however its a subscription based system, that can
&gt;&gt;only be accessed by a member. MK

&gt;Oh, no!  Are curcumstances forcing me to sell my beloved Camper?  I love
&gt;&gt;my '83, water tight camper.  It has 135k, on it's second engine (email
&gt;&gt;me for sad story about how the first met its end), has a top speed on
&gt;&gt;the level, no tail wind, no drafting of 83 mph.  But because of wierd
&gt;&gt;problem #2, I think I will have to sell it.  Please send comments and
&gt;&gt;suggestions!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Weird problem #1.  When the wheater is warm, turn the key...and no
&gt;&gt;starter.  Checked the  usual: starter and switch fine.  Can start it by
&gt;&gt;crawling under wit a screw driver on the terminals.  Mechanic puts a
&gt;&gt;booster on the starter and it works for a while.  I take it back and
&gt;&gt;tell him to fix it or put a aux starter button on it.  He does the later
&gt;&gt;and the problem is rendered moot.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Weird problem #2: Intermitantly hard to start.  I run 2 batteries.
&gt;&gt;Rarely starts on main battery even tho engine cranks just fine.  No
&gt;&gt;firing at all.  Spark OK, therefore...  Put the battery on both, fires
&gt;&gt;up.  Usually.  Sometimes takes me 15 minutes to start it.  If that
&gt;&gt;happens the reason is that it is flooded.  When engine is warm, best to
&gt;&gt;open throtle all the way to disable cold start injecter before cranking.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;All the mechanics I've talked to in the Ft. Worth, TX area say take it
&gt;&gt;to Tim's German Auto, he's the only one who really knows VWs.  (I had
&gt;&gt;been avoiding Tim because he is supper expensive) Tim says sounds like
&gt;&gt;an injector problem, and those problems are very expensive.  Suggests I
&gt;&gt;put a carburetor on it.  Anyone ever done this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Call a guy who sells the kits.  He says don't because I'll never be able
&gt;&gt;to get an inspection sticker in the Metroplex.  (We are under strick EPA
&gt;&gt;rules).  Seems if you start with fuel injection you have to stay with
&gt;&gt;it.  I'm stumped.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Suggestions, offers?
&gt;&gt;
