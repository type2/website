From:         Matthew Bulley &lt;GMBulley_at_AOL.COM&gt;
Subject:      Stats &amp; results on soundproof-interior project.

Starting to get a little chilly out...Gettin' to be camping &amp; hiking
weather!!! : )

The interior is now basically complete in Suzy's van. In a future (HUGE)
posting I will share all of the secrets of soundproofing, rustproofing and
thermal insulating. For now, check these unbeleivable stats. Suzy's van now
includes:

Five packages of Evercoat &quot;Q-Pads&quot;, (adhesive 1/4&quot; thick asphalt/rubber
sound-killer pads
A fifty foot roll of 3M &quot;Sound Deadener&quot; (similar to above)
An entire roll of R-13 fiberglass insulation
A can of 3M Rust Preventative (like Waxoil)
Four cans of polyurethane expansion foam sealant
Four gallons of &quot;Kool Patch&quot; undercoating
Two rolls of JCWhitney's &quot;Sound and Heat Insulation used by NASA&quot;
A roll of Fiber-tech Fiberglass/silica exhaust wrap heat shield insulation
Eight yards of 4-mil plastic
A &quot;Dual Trumpet&quot; 135 db air horn, (okay, that's actually OUTSIDE the van)
11 yards of 1/2&quot; multi-fiber sound absorbing upholstery padding (similar to
NASA stuff but no aluminum foil facing)
Eight yards of &quot;chip-foam&quot; carpet padding
12 yards of upholstery cloth
11 yards of curtain material
Five cans of contact adhesive
1,250 staple-gun staples
11 luggage anchors
30 large sheet metal screws
Six yards of industrial &quot;berber&quot; carpeting
12 ounces of clear silicone sealant
Two yards of 3&quot; thick foam padding

The neat thing: now that the panels and carpeting are back in, You can't see
any of the &quot;stuff&quot; that makes this van SOOOOO Quiet. Inside, it looks like a
nicely upholstered bus with a double-hinged bed folded up in the lugage space
behind the rear seat. From the outside, it just looks like a '76
school-bus-yellow Transporter with a beautiful, tall, young babe driving;
hands-off, that's my Suzanne! : )

I am not joking when I say the only &quot;noise&quot; in the van is the air coming in
through the vents at highway speed. Even the DPO's Yokahama-S-701's are
quietly cooperating; road noise is nil.  (We have Y-370's on order at S-ears)
Wind noise is acceptable. Body reverb and noise transfer on the highway is
nil. At 70mph you can talk in a conversational tone! Any noise that makes its
way into the van is quickly quelled by the sound-absorbing padding lurking
behind the upholstery cloth. Pretty sneaky, eh?

Instead of the sliding door reverberating all of the van's sheet metal for 5
seconds on closing: sounding like
&quot;roooor-aaarrrrr-cladd-ddunkk-ahh-chack-aaaaaannnng&quot;, it now rolls silently
to a &quot;cludunk&quot;. Prior to this interior work, it sounded like we had a
sheet-metal pounding factory AND an air compressor running inside the van. You
 can still hear the motor, but only as a distant, faint, low burble.This will
be very nice for highway motoring, and that was the goal.

We still have a 128 quart cooler (will take the place of the back seat), side
tent, and window tint to engineer/install, and some mechanicals to do before
our 5-week tour of the USA &amp; Mex in Oct./Nov. Getting VERY excited. Will keep
you posted.
