I don't believe the flourescents are that much more efficient.  Looking
at them in the catalogs, they typically consume anywhere from 1-2 amps,
and if I remember, the incandescents are close to the same.  Also, they
are expensive, ranging from $40 to $60.  Not worth it, in my book.  But
then, the drain of the lights is almost insignificant compared with the
fridge, in my camper.  The flourescents, in addition to being very
expensive, also consume more real estate, and replacement bulbs are
expensive and relatively hard to find.  You can get a replacement bulb
for an incandescent light at just about any auto parts store.  That
about sums up my opinion of 12V flourescent lights.  =)
