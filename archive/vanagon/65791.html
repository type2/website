Subject:      87Syncro,Headlights won't turn on

To any and all,
      Fairly minor problem has occurred (unless I drive at night).  My
headlights won't turn on.  The running lights work, and the highbeams work.
 I checked the fuses and they seemed fine.  This same problem happened a
month ago but after flipping the headlight switch a couple of times they
turned on and now they will not at all.
Any ideas would be much appreciated!
