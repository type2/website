Hi Sergio.  I have a '90, and I just had my fuel injector recall 
performed in April of this year.  I live in Canada, and have a 
Canadian Westy.  I have been following your posts on this to much 
amazement as I haven't experienced ANY problems.

My fuel mileage has improved between 1 &amp; 2 mpg, and cold starting has 
never been better (although I put in some Bosch Platinums about the 
same time).  The van runs flawlessly, with lots of ooomph for hills 
now more than ever.

I hate to contradict your results, but I do believe that your dealer 
must have done something wrong.  My recall included 4 injectors and 
new fuel lines/rails.  Nothing electrical.

Harry.
 
&gt; A quick recap... Ever since my fuel injectors were changed as part of a recall,
&gt; My van started stalling/hesitating, bad performance, not starting, etc. I took it in 4 times to have it checked with no answer. It broke 2 times with exactly
&gt; the same problem, smoke, stalling to a halt and then never started again. THe
&gt; first time they dealer said it was the air-flow sensor ($500 part) and I drove
&gt; the van home...but still same symptoms were still there. Last week the van broke
&gt; again under exaclty the same conditions and now it does not start, it turns, but
&gt; it never starts.
&gt; 
&gt; I am sueing. No matter how much it costs in legal fees. I need some supporting
&gt; comments from anyone that had similar problems or FI recalls... IN other words,
&gt; I am going to have to prove that this was indeed a FI recall problem that 
&gt; initiated the whole problem. It would take an idiot not to figure it out, but we all know about the judicial system, so I want to have all the supporting documentation I can.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; Sergio
