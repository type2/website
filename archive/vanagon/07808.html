Subject: Re: Gas heater boosters

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I just joined the list (70 poptop) and am about to bring up a topic that
&gt;probably gets regularily beaten to death: auxillary gas heaters. (I've
&gt;scanned the archive and got some good information there, just need some
&gt;details)


You're trying to put the underfloor pancake heater in where no heater has 
gone before. The $200-300 seems stiff, not unreasonable though. How many 
hours is that BTW? You only need to mount 4~5 rubber block hangers, a fuel 
pump and a relay plus pull the wires to it. I would do as much of the basic 
mechanical work, ie electric drill + wrench myself, get your mechanic to 
inspect and button it up. I've dropped/remounted those heaters in half a 
day, to get at frozen up fan motors, they're not difficult just awkward. 
Electrical wiring is always a problem however. Note that your mechanic is 
giving you a 'good deal' on the heater with the hopes of landing three times 
that amount in labour charges &lt;grin&gt;!
        I personally don't like the pancake heaters, they are huge, and the 
massive surface area coupled with air flow/slush etc under the van means 
that they lose most of their heat before it even gets to the inside. It was 
a half-assed solution to getting extra heat to the defrosters for stop and 
go traffic and during warmup. Lousy altogether for camping.
        The best setup is the older roundstyle heaters that fit inside your 
engine compartment, warm and snug, protected from the elements. The have 
only one motor, not 2 (or was it 3?) and provide ample heat. The best ones 
have a white plastic cover over the fan that turns into a rectangular cross 
section duct. This sneaks up to a plastic grate in your spare tire well in 
the left rear and sucks in interior air. The hot air is pushed through a 
rectangular metal duct that goes through the firewall and warms your rear 
passenger area. They have a heat level knob that sits below the drivers 
seat, and a 10 foot cable to the unit, ignore it, just set it on max at the 
heater and leave it there. You can turn it off when you get too hot, hah hah 
just kidding. 
        If I were you &lt;well you're not, so piss off&gt; I would look for the 
'original setup' for your year, the hole through the fire wall can be cut 
with a jigsaw to get in the hot air. Let me know, and I'll make a cutting 
template up from my '72 Westy for you. The cold air return is an option, 
since engine compartment air when camped/motor off or on the highway is 
adequate for breathing. Replacing older heat exchangers and sealing leaks in 
the piping for your conventional front heat will pay way better returns for 
comfort on the road for the same $400, if needed! That's where I'd put my 
money first, I rarely freeze while camped. That's what the sleeping bag is for. 
                                                        
                                                            IMHO!!   tim s.


PS: the ignition plug for both types of heaters is damned expensive, they 
usually erode at the spark gap, but if you VERY GENTLY twist the centre 
electrode sideways , closer to the rim, you can get them to spark again. 
VERY GENTLY!!! Look for hidden electrical relays + fuses, behind the front 
kickpanel on left for the older heaters, as the heater draws lots of current 
and needs them. You'll cook the timer/control switch if you wire it directly.
