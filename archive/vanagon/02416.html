A few of thoughts on westy showers...


	I've used the commercial solar shower (vinyl bag, black
	one side, clear the other), and it worked pretty well
	when I hung/laid it up on the luggage rack on the rear
	of my 72 westy. Up here in the frozen north, it didn't 
	warm up that fast, and it didn't &quot;seem&quot; to warm up as
	fast when driving as when the bus was stationary. I
	think the problem was the metal roof on the 72, (I
	removed the luggage bars), which conducted heat away. Kept
	meaning to cut a bit of ensolite for insulation. But
	this should not be as much of a problem on the
	fiberglass luggage rack. I would lean towards a
	big solar shower bag just for the simplicity of it, no
	plumbing in the van, run the hose externally to wherever.
	The bag also can be removed easily, and hung elsewhere
	for a shower. One drawback of the bag is the difficulty
	filling the thing in a lake or stream, you really have to
	pour the water in.
	Somewhere I heard about a camp shower that stored the water
	in the base of the unit and was pumped by a foot pump.
	(Sort of like one of those oil drain pans that catch and
	store the oil).

	Running engine coolant through a heat exchanger in a water
	tank gives me the heeby-jeebies. The cooling system in 
	the vans is byzantine enough. I thought about a separate
	system, with a copper line running into the engine compartment
	to pick up heat then into a second water tank. The water
	being circulated by a little 12V pump, manual switch or 
	thermostat. The pump would have to be quite heat tolerant.
