Paul,

Sorry, but I didn't do anything special to get the upright engine in my
bus, it was already there.

Actually, my bus, and the '71 in the States, came with the upright
engine. After that they came with the 'pancake' engine, ie no high
shroud, twin carbs, lower rear deck height, hatch in deck, etc. Although
Ross (see previous post) said that his '72 twin cab ute had a 1600
upright as standard. It too now has a 1776 upright.

The pancake engine went through its changes and your '79 is quite different
from the first one, EFI for a start.

There are many who have said on this list, and in books, etc, that a bus
with the last of the uprights was one of the best type IIs made.

I seem to remember that there has been some discussion about putting an
upright engine in place of a pancake, or vice versa, and that there were
opinions expressed for and against.

Maybe some other list members might be able to help.
