Per your request on information for your '77 VW camper, my sources show
that the stock tire was a 185r14 load range 'c'.
Goodyear does produce this tire in that size in a tire line called the
Wrangler HT. This is a rib design for highway service.
If this tire size is incorrect,please advise correct size on vehicle.
