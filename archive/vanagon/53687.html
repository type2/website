Chris,

I guess there are flat connectors inside the
plastic wire connector:

You have to push down that small spring you see on top  of
the side view with a very small flat screwdriver which is
pushed between the metal connector and the plastic cover.
Than the connector gets out backwards. You may turn the
spring to it's regular position and it can be used once
more.
