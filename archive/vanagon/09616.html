Subject:      eastern gathering(s) ...

ok, a little lookie at the stats and this is what i've come up with.
in order to keep the trip down to a managable length (i.e., no more than
ONE cheek goes completely to sleep in the seat), here are some possibilities:

New England:
  MA   8 folks  so this would give 19 people a chance to get together. my
  CT   1 folke  suggestion would be to go to the LiMBO Buses by the Rock
  RI   1 folke  or something like that ... which would be many more buses.
  NJ   3 folks  they meet up around Plymouth Rock. that wouldn't be toooo
  NY   6 folks  far (except for the upstate and western new yorkers)

Midwest-Canada:
  Ontario  7 folks      maybe meet somewhere around Erie, PA? that seems to
  OH       6 folks      be about equidistant for all those concerned. ??
  PA       9 folks      that would be 28 folks, if everyone showed up.
  NY       6 folks (?)

Southeast:
  OH   6 folks  this would be the biggest area covered, putting 32 folks
  KY   1 folke  within reach of a get-together, perhaps in the east-TN
  AL   1 folke  border with VA/NC/SC ... which sounds to me like the
  MD   4 folks  Blue Ridge Parkway or Smokey Mountain Nat'l Park. or some
  VA   3 folks  other place of note (like Boone, NC or maybe even Blowing
  NC  11 folks  Rock, NC. :) &lt;not REAL suggestions, by the way!&gt;
  SC   1 folke
  GA   5 folks
  DC   1 folke

now, afore anybody gets all ruffled cause they got left out, i omitted several
states on the edges of those areas because of the miles and the season. i just
figured that the PA folks probably wouldn't want to drive that far, and the
FL folks wouldn't either. it MIGHT be close enough, but then it might not.

about 8 hours is the max for anyone to drive to something like this ... leave
early and get there before sunset. now, figure an average of 50 mph and that
puts you at 400 miles. so AL ain't gonna make it to southern Ontario nor to
Plymouth Rock, and i don't think anyone from MA is gonna come all the way
down to VA or NC.

just rambling, actually. :)
