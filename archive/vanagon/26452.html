&gt;&gt;     Hello out there, BusBoys, Jim can you hear me.
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;     I've been trying to email BusBoys for a while with no response, but
&gt;&gt;     my mail isn't bouncing. 
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;     Have they got a new email address?
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;     If you're listening Boys please email me, it's about my order.
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;     cheers,
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;&gt;     Lee.

&gt;I've been trying the same thing about a catalog I ordered.  Since I, too, am
&gt;on AOL I can check sent mail and it keeps saying &quot;Mail not yet read&quot;.  Are
&gt;you there, Jim?

Hey you guys,

Just order something from them, i.e., send them some $$$, and they'll be
glad to pay attention and send a catalogue with the order.  I ordered a
couple of minor things from Jim at Bus Boys the other day, worth about $30,
and received it within a week or so.  Jim, however, talked down to me,
condescendingly (sp?), like I had an I.Q. of 79.  Maybe I just misread his
vibes, he was having a bad hair day or maybe his bedside manner just needs
some work.  Whatever, the bottom line to me is competent, quick service,
correct, quality parts and okay prices.  They passed that test, anyway.

Rocky Mountain Motor Works (The Bus Stop), in Colo Springs, charges me about
half as much as Bus Boys for UPS shipping/&quot;handling,&quot; though, and probably
because I'm closer, gets my order to me, UPS ground, by Friday if I order
Tuesday morning.  Hard to beat that, although RMMW's prices are a little
steep. (They DO give me a 15% jobber discount, though, which helps some.)
