&gt; 	Tracey,
&gt; 	On Type IVs there's a thermostat on the bottom of the engine
&gt; that drives a couple of flaps at the top to control the flow of
&gt; cooling air. I think your 72 has an 'upright' Type II motor, which
&gt; may or may not differ from a Type I. I just bought the Bay Window/Breadloaf/
&gt; 68-79 Bus Bentley book and I'll look-up thermostats tonight.

No, they stopped putting the type I &quot;upright&quot; engine in the bus in mid-year
1971.  Unless the bus is from out of the country, it has the type IV
pancake motor.

&gt; 	Thermostats are popularly left off aircooled engines by 
&gt; silly people who assume that more cooling is always better- which makes
&gt; it hard for the engine to warm up, blah, blah.

I'm one of those silly people, and I maintain that it is better for my
engine to have the flaps removed.  They way they work is silly!  They 
direct air away from the oil cooler.  I took them out and my oil temp
dropped noticably.  The flaps do help the engine warm up faster, yes, but
IMO that is to protect against the &quot;silly people&quot; who get into their cars
and immediatly floor it and rev it to redline while it is still cold.  I
have had the cooling flaps out for a long time now, and have no regrets.

&gt; 	My 914 came without a thermostat and I installed one, but
&gt; I can't say I noticed any difference. It just made me feel better :-)

Keep an eye on that oil temp there, friend... :)
