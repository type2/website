&gt;And I guess that back to the military spending question, why did this 
&gt;congress try to give the military more money than they had even asked for 
&gt;while advocating cutting social programs?
=========================
1)  It is called Civilian control of the military
2)  It has to do with politics and pork barrel legislation
3)  Please note that the Congress and Executive branch now have a majority of
members (and in particular, a &quot;Commander-In-Chief) that have NO experience in
the military, yet are responsible for setting the responsibilities of the
military and committing them to action.  Yet they have NO personal experience
of what this involves.  They have yet to specify exactly what in Bosnia is in
the vital interest of the United States that is worth the committment of US
forces, what the rules of engagement will be so our people can protect
themselves, and to what extent (how many casualties) are they willing to keep
our forces committed.
