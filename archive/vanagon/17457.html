My Dad always calls my '85 &quot;Halen&quot;...
I still prefer &quot;The Vananagoon&quot; Don't know why.

Ric,  I missed you at Duxbury Beach.
Christian, keep your eye open in Boston, My brother has borrowed my van
to take another load of stuff home, he's movin' back to Toronto.
It's an '85 with red flannel tied to the antenna and Ontario plates.
Tell me if he's &quot;hooning around&quot; like a maniac in it.  :)
