&gt; This is a long shot, but it happened to me on my 1981 Volvo.  It is
&gt; possible that the fuel take-up line inside the fuel tank has rusted and
&gt; cracked.  This means that you cannot use all of the fuel in your tank as
&gt; your fuel line no longer reaches to the bottom of the tank.  I hope this
&gt; isn't your problem as the only fix is removal of the tank and r/r of the
&gt; fuel line.  This is messy and runs the risk of rusty parts breaking and
&gt; ruining other adjacent (also rusty) components.  You can have a big can
of
&gt; worms really easily.  The simplest solution for this problem is to visit
&gt; the gas station as often as necessary, with your revised gas tank
capacity.
&gt;  Good luck!

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;     Well, I have now replaced all the parts that I know of in the
Fuel
&gt; &gt;  Gauge system on my 83.5 in an attempt to not take the thing to the
&gt; &gt;  dealer and his &quot;VAG&quot; tester. The gauge is still flakey, and van runs
out
&gt; &gt;  of gas before gauge reads empty. No dent in tank. I have replaced
&gt; &gt;  sending unit, gauge and voltage regulator/stabilizer. Any further
&gt; &gt;  suggestions?
&gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; Here is one....figure out your &quot;new empty location on the guage&quot; and
&gt; avoid
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; Seriously, I had a '80 Westy with the same problem, despite my similar
&gt; &gt; attemps to fix it, it remaind a frustrating mystery.  I started to
carry
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; spare gas tank ( with gas of course ) at all times.....there is a cool
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; that fits in the spare tire....think I saw it on www.vanagon_dot_com.  Good
&gt; luck.
