What does this mean?  I'm all for preserving the synaptic moment but what does
this thing think about as I'm sporting down the road?  What is it called and
does it have anything to do with power regulation or battery charging?

As an old girlfriend once told me, &quot;The problem [with me] is too hot a spark
across too wide a gap.&quot;

Oh well,
