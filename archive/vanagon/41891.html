Subject: Hydr. lifter finally pumped up '81 (long)

Thanks to all, with the encouragement and help. After changing to a 
thinner oil and letting those suckers clank for a while they finally 
worked. (I could not remove them, too much varnish)
So after many nights of frustrating setbacks I finally 
got it done. I fine tuned everyting and cleaned it up the rodent nest 
in the cab and washed it. 
Lessons learned-
Bad Pilot bearings make the same sound as a bad throw-out bearing or 
clutch  (Parts Place has a 20% restock charge ouch!)
Make sure all the exhaust system in firmly attached, it needed a lot of 
work once I got the motor out
(lost heater hose and broke header last winter)
Dow Bath cleaner works as good as Gunk
Oil Leaks make a awful mess if you let them go for a year.
Tap and Die sets are mandatory if you get a vehicle from a numbnut 
do-it-yourselfer. (PO butchered a lot including the alternator 
bracket mount and fan shroud bolts)
You must be very patient when dealing with parts suppliers. 
If this was my daily driver I would have been out of luck in a big 
way. Wrong parts shipped, and ordered parts charged but not shipped. 
Believe it or not the local VW dealer was the only place that got my 
parts order straight (the 2 clips for the throw-out bearing, of 
course they were $12.59 each)&lt;grin&gt;

Even my semi-local guru sent the wrong o-ring for the flywheel.
Roots will grow thru tires if left long enough 
Most of all it pays to know a good machinest (my buddy custom fabbed 
parts for the exhaust, carb and fixed the new damaged motor mount.
He also had a huge can of metric bolt &amp;  nuts and machine screws for 
the tin. If I had a dollar for every missing fastener I could have 
paid the dealer to fix it!
 The first trip will be Buses on the blue ridge MAy 31st.
