Subject: scooter car query


&gt;While at the Pescados fish taco vanagon/bus meet yesterday in Sacramento,
&gt;I got my first glimpse of something called a &quot;scooter car.&quot;  I only
&gt;saw it for a moment, but it was sorta like a motorcycle-sized thing,
&gt;but wrapped in a car body.  It had I think 2 wheels on the front,
&gt;and one on the back.  

&gt;I'm fascinated!  Does anyone know anything about these cars?  When
&gt;and where made?  STill available?  Specs?  Success?  I'm told there
&gt;may even be some sort of scooter club, either on the 'net or off.  

&gt;Anyway, any info you can give me I'll be very eager to get!

&gt;TIA,

&gt;/martha

Martha,

I think what you're talking about is a vehicle made from a brand-new German
Messerschmidt fighter plane fuselage.  Seems that there were a lot of 'em
left over after WWII, lacking wings, engine, tail, etc.  Someone apparently
decided to make use of them and turned out a number of very strange-looking
three-wheeled cars.  The passenger sits behind the driver.

The lead character in the film &quot;Brazil&quot; drives one (to go with all of the
other goofy-looking technological marvels in the movie).  I can't remember
what they're called but I saw a couple of them in Austin (one of them was
for sale at a gas station).  I believe that there's a club for owners of
this funny aminal.
