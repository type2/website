their stats.

&gt;&gt; On the Car Talk Web site (home of Click and Clack), they've got a survey
&gt;&gt; running where they're collecting info about the car you drive as well as
&gt;&gt; info about you.  These guys are fairly anti-vwbus and here's our opportunity
&gt;&gt; to skew some results.  But more interesting is that the survey also asks
&gt;&gt; lots of  personality questions with the goal of establishing some sort of
&gt;&gt; real analysis along the lines of &quot;you are what you drive&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If we all take the survey then, since the entire VW bus/van internet
&gt;&gt; community is probably on this list already, the results really become
&gt;&gt; a statement about us!  I encourage everyone to take the survey.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And, its a really fun web site (imo).

&gt;I just filled out the survey, for my '67 &quot;vanagon&quot;. They didn't even have a
&gt;category for bus. Anyway, I did my civil duty as a bus owner, and heartily
&gt;recommend that everyone else who has a chance do the same. Let's show 'em!
