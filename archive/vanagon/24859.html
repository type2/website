Subject: RE: 87 Westy questions

I have an '87 Vanagon Camper and I can think of a few things that you may be
interested in checking out. 1) front rotor thickness (mine were worn pretty
good and the ones I saw in the junk yard were also worn past min thickness)
2) Intermittent hesitation durin long trips (appears to be a miss caused by
plug wires shorting to the engine? or a bug in the &quot;brain&quot;?)3) pop top
canvas mildew  4) pop top sun roof operation (mine is a no-op as the thing
needs to be replaced) 5) overheats upon long idles (this can be checked in
a short period of time) That is all I can think of now, maybe more later.
