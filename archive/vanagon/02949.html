Subject: '56 Bus Turn Signals

Ok,

	(refresher: trying to hook up turn signals on a '56 bus)

	I figured out why the right signal wasn't working but the left one was:
I had the wrong wire connected to the &quot;bright&quot; lead on the tail lights!
Now they both work, and I went ahead and hooked up the front nipple lights, and
they work too!  Also fixed the connectors for the master cylinder and got
the brake light circuit working too!

	There are two screw-type connectors on the lights.  On the left side,
there are two wires; ont the right side there are three.  I still have not 
figured out what the third wire is for!  One is for the taillights, one
is for the blinkers...

	No, the third is not for the brake lights.  Remember, this is a '56,
so the brake light is in the engine lid, (Sob, oh how I want one of those
so bad :( If one the A-hole I bought it from hadn't swiped it)  Does
anyone know what that wire would go to?

	Another idea, if you have a turn signal switch that is loose and won't
tighten, and just wants to slid 'round the steering column, you can cut a 
strip of 18 guage sheet metal about 1&quot; long and 1/2&quot; wide, and put it under
one side of the clamshell of the switch, like a ship.  Tighten everything 
up, and voila, a stable switch!  (I use to have to hold the switch with
one hand and move the lever withthe other!  Who's holding the wheel?)

	Hope this has been a help... 

Thom
