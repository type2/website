I'm ever on the hunt for these things.  YOu all may enjoy this one -
it doesn't have to be entirely without VW content  :) - it's a music
lyric server.  You can amuse yourselves by typing in &quot;bus&quot; or &quot;van&quot;
or &quot;microbus&quot; and track down musical references to your favorite
vehicle.

One has the option to track 3 ways:  
words from the body of a song
artist or title
first letter of the artist or group's name

This ought to keep some of you busy for a few hours at least...have fun.
