Richard;
Sounds like the system is settling down after the normal fits. Had
anymore trouble?

The next moring, when I opened her up to check things (cold, about 28
deg)
the coolant was near the normal mark, maybe slightly high. Then after
driving 150 miles home later that day, and checking often, the coolant
level
stayed &quot;normal&quot; the entire time???
