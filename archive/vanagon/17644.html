Subject: Re: Magnetic Vanagon Window Screens

Hey Now,
I just bought a 95 eurovan camper. Last weekend I put on a full set of screens
that I bought from the dealer (right and left front, side door and rear hatch).
Cool stuff. They have an elastic band that goes around the window
frames and snaps that I had to install my self. I didn't like drilling the
holes in the body but what the hey. I donno if these new screens will fit
older models but you might want to contact a dealer. The front screens will
need a magnet to hold down the bottom of the screen to make it bug proof.

I'll be testing them out next weekend in VA Beach.

&gt; I purchased a set of these a couple of years ago. I keep them stored over
&gt; the engine on a flat piece of cardboard. On a hot buggy day they are
&gt; invaluable.
&gt;
&gt; The company that makes these also makes a piece for the sliding door. This
&gt; piece doesn't work so good.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Got JC Whitney Catalog #578J in the mail the other day. On page 92, it lists
&gt; &gt;magnetic Vanagon window screens for $33.95 per set (2). It says:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The part number is 12BP2743R
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Their phone number is (312) 431-6102
