Friend of mine has a 75 bus, it is a two-tone brown scheme, with the
lighter brown on top. 

IMHO the best looking Westys have been the blue
ones of the early eighties. My wife wants to paint our fibreglass roof
the same as the body - Ivory. I would prefer to paint the whole thing blue
or keep the body ivory and the roof white. In either case, would the paint
stick to the fibreglass top? Is painting a westy an expensive
proposition? DC
