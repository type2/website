&gt; Here's the story on octane:  At one time (up til the early '70s?), there
&gt; were two ways to measure octane, research octane (based on lab work with
&gt; the fuel) and another system (I forget the name) based on tests in an

Motor Octane Number

&gt; actual engine.  The two systems usually give somewhat different
&gt; numbers.

RON is always significantly higher than MON

&gt;Most car makers (including VW) specified research octane, often
&gt; listed as R.O.N. (Research Octane Number?).

Yes, RON or R.O.N. is Research Octane Number

&gt; The US government, in its
&gt; usual wisdom, decided that since people couldn't agree on a method, they
&gt; should invent a third one!  So, when the government started requiring
&gt; that octane be marked on the gas pump, it was required that the two
&gt; existing methods be averaged to come up with a number (the fine print on
&gt; the sticker even reads (R+M)/2.

(Research + Motor) / 2

&gt; So, when VW calls out 91 R.O.N., as the gas flap sticker on my Jetta and
&gt; the owner's manual for my Vanagon both do, that is the same (more or
&gt; less) as the US gas pump number of 87, which is the usual number for
&gt; regular in most areas.

The RON is typicall about 4 points or so higher than the (R+M)/2  number.

&gt; Are people really putting premimum gas in Vanagons for this reason?

Unfortunately yes.  Also, many motorists believe that the Octane number is
somehow a measure of the &quot;goodness&quot; of the gas.  It is simply a measure of
the fuel's ability to resist compression detination, allowing higher
compression engines to operate with higher Octane Number fuels.  I'd guess
that 1/2 of the &quot;premium&quot; gas sold in the USA is put into cars where it does
has no useful function, other than make additional profit for people in the
fuel business.
