nooooooooooooo ... i think that's just a tad TOOOOO tight!!! :)

&gt;So: This thing IS too tight, right?  The new CV is defective, and I
&gt;should spare myself any further agravation and just return it for
&gt;(another) new one, right?  Or am I missing something really basic here?
&gt;(And yes, I DID grease the new CV before installing it!)

yeah, i think you need to take that one back. it might be rusted together or
just pressure-fitted, but it damn sure ought to have moved around with the
axle and you pulling on it! imho.
