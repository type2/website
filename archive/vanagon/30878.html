&gt;        I *do* have a picture of Mother Mary up by my rearview-has the
&gt;Magnificat on the back *in spanish*! Left over from the PO, I kinda like
&gt;the wierdness of it...


My ex-wife is from Cebu in the Philippines. There, every vehicle, house,
store, and large closet has a small shrine containing at least a figurine
of the Christ child, referred to as &quot;El Santo Nino&quot;. There's a two-week
celebration in His honor every January, called Sinulog.

I carried over the tradition for her when buying a car for her before
she arrived, sticking such a small statue on the dashboard. She carefully
maintained it 'till we sold the car four years later.
