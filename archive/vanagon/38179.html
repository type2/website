Hmmm... I, too, have a 2.0 L AFC FI motor with warm start wierdness.  It 
will start just fine, but I have to give it gas to do so (this is on a FI 
motor, remember?), and continue to give it extra gas for 5 - 10 seconds 
or it will die.  After that, it feels bright and happy again.  Been like 
that since I bought it, lived with it, probably will continue to live 
with it.  Weird, though.  Go figure.
