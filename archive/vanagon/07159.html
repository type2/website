&gt; With my old blow-by laden engine, leaving the oil cap loose meant a day
&gt; of cleaning the back of NuBus.  With my newer engine, I can
&gt; leave the cap loose all day and not have a bit of oil leak out. YMMV.
That must be nice to be able to do, but if I put a new enging in this thing,
well ... I'd be worse than merely poor for a while .... the blow-by is 
something I'll have to live with ... but Matthew, did you put a new 1.6 L
diesel in NuBus?
