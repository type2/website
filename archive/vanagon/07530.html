&gt; what do you mean 'free'
&gt; 
&gt; explain for us lesser informed VW owners....

Free... Gratis... No charge.

There was an article in a local free (oh oh... there's the word free again!)
computer rag called Computer Currents entitled &quot;MCI's Friends &amp; Family E-Mail
Service.&quot;  I called the 800 number in the article (800-624-9862) and 
asked for more info.  So... I got lots of info, and they are mailing me 
the software.  

The free part is receiving mail.  But they said that right now you can also
send 10 messages a month for free, $0.25/msg after that.  The whole service
is free for MCI customers, and $5/month for non-MCI people.  And they also
have alot of extra services that they charge for.  The service is accessed
from another 800 number, so overall I would think that it would be good for
anyone in the country that wants to get any mailing lists. 

You mailed your question to me personaly, but it sounds like you wanted 
me to expand on everyone's knowlegde... so I'mm CCing this to the Vanagon 
list and the Vintage VW list.  

Standard disclaimer: I don't work for MCI, I'm just sick of those damn 
ATT commercials!
