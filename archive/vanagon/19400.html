&gt; So David Schwarze says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My strategy is
&gt; &gt; to leave my bus in such pitiful-looking shape that instead of keying it
&gt; &gt; people will leave money underneath my wipers.  Hasn't worked yet,
&gt; &gt; though.  =) 

It's really true that a shiny new paint job will bring out the jerks
and the theives. It wasn't until we painted our bug that somebody
tried to steal it. Luckily, the battery was dead, so they couldn't
get it going.
