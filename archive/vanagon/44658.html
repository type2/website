Subject: what's in a window (f)

July '96 issue VW Trends FERTIG (?) dept. p.102 features a bus with a
stained glass window... no biggie for me. As a professional glasshole for 20
years I've done my share of windows for cars humpmobiles etc. along with
other unusual requests including a skylite in a dog house.

I would now like to nominate myself the official archivist of Photos of
Stained Glass Windows in VW Buses (unless someone's already beat me to it) 

Gotta pic? send it along
