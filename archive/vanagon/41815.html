Subject: Barndoor Page Update

I copped 2 barndoor pix from Sami Dahklia of a ver early panel that used to
belong to his grandfather.  I think its a '51, based on a couple
characteristics I'm aware of.

Anyway, one pic is of the barndoor next a a body of water, and the other is
of his mom washing the bus!  Both pix were taken in Germany, I believe.  He
can prolly fill us in on more details...
