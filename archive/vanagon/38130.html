Subject: Clean air wannabe

For some time I've enjoyed the travails of the California list members in
dealing with the emissions gestapo. Turns out that the EPA has probably tired
of trying to get Atlanta to clean up it's sewage before we send it downstream
to Alabama and is going to focus on auto emissions instead. As I understand
it, cars under 7 years will be examined in simple local tests while older
cars will be examined in more centralized locations by &quot;THE STATE&quot;. Not only
will you have to pass the measurements but all the original pieces will have
to be there and functioning. My 81 that was comfortably outside the current
inspection requirements is now of course swept back in.

My apologies to the left coasters for my secret enjoyment at your expense and
BTW, what was all that stuff about EGR valves, charcoal canisters, cat
converters etc.!
