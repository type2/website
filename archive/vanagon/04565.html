Subject: Re: Re: CA, land of busses galore

This weekend while getting gas, this guy pulls in with the
split window w/ the four/five small windows along the top and
the slide back moon roof top (don't know what these buses
are called).  Anyway I go over and begin talking to him and
he tells me it's a '67 that he just bought three months ago
and is going to restore it.  So far the only work he's done
is raise it back up.  He said the kid that owned it had it
lowered (only in Calif. would some dufas lower a classic like
this).  So I tell him about this list and he doesn't have
or know anything about computers or networks.  He thinks this
setup is great and would like to post questions once in awhile.
I told him I'd pass along Joels collection of books, repair,
and parts places to him.  He was stoked about that because he
said he has no idea where to start.

&gt; &gt; was in palo alto last week on the company and stopped at the
&gt; &gt; palo alto duckpond for a look at the waterfowl
&gt;
&gt; It's fun to watch the Cessnas there, too! :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Saw a eurovan, two vangons, a loaf and an 'owl-face' (my version
&gt; &gt; of split) all packed into a little space. One of the bird watchig
&gt; &gt; groups came up and drove off as i watched and didnt 'see' anything unusual
&gt;
&gt; Seems pretty VW-crowded to me!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Here in upstate NY if you see an owl-face you honk and jump up and down
&gt; &gt; in surprise .....
&gt;
&gt; They're not THAT common here! I jump up and down and honk if I see one.
&gt; Yesterday at lunchtime, I was driving through the parking lot near Una
&gt; Mas! in Otto ('59 Single) and what do I see across the lot but a dark blue
&gt; or primer big-tailight split crewcab. I followed her all the way through
&gt; the lot and honked, but she didn't see me. I have the same question:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; wasnt anyone on the list was it ????? ;)
