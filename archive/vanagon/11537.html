&gt;|for two reasons:

&gt;|((stuff deleted)) ......
&gt;
&gt;|What can I do to free up the cable easily? Any quick fixes?

&gt;
&gt;	i know that virginia is notorious for
&gt;	its safety inspections; but, one thing you
&gt;	might try is going to another inspector.
&gt;	i did this with my chopped bug, and it
&gt;	worked! you have to find an inspector that
&gt;	has a heart. avoid the stiff dry-cleaned
&gt;	pressed shirt uniformed types with the 10 gallon
&gt;	wide brimmed hats shiny shoes and dark sunglasses.
&gt;
&gt;ps that bug is nolonger registered, for any of you  informer types.

I can give some good recomendations of places in No. VA if required.
Chris.
