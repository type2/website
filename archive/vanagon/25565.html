Subject: Re: High Lift jack (was winches)

A high lift jack works well for Vanagon. You simply have to guy a giant
bolt, like, 1-1/4&quot; diameter by 1 or 2 foot long (or something like that
dimension). You stick this into the factory jack points of the car and lift
up on it with the high lift. 

The operation of this jack is documented in my Vanagon Off Road video tape.

&gt;&gt;The high lift jack is cheap and reliable and doesn't require 80-200 amps to 
&gt;&gt;work.
&gt;
&gt;When I last looked at a High-Lift jack it didn't appear to be very well
&gt;suited to jacking a Vanagon.  Are there different models, or an adapter or
&gt;something?
