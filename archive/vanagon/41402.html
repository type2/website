As Jon said...you missed a great batch of Transporter Ale...  ;-)


We (me, my wife, Alex (3yr old), Erik (16 yr old...and lookin for a van), 
and his frien Morgan) showed up about 11:00 am. We were the first EV there 
(and obviously the class of the show...   8)   )....lots of splitties, etc. 
There was one splittie there in particular (a 58) which had more rot than 
body.....I've only seen one other VW Van which had rust holes in the roof!!!

Jon showed up around 1:00 or so.... I was about to give up on seeing any one 
from the list there. We hung around till two....as we were leaving Drew 
Jenkins and his Syncro was heading in...and a couple of miles from the beach 
there was a late splittie sunroof (green and white) sitting in a convenience 
store next to a red VW Fox (sporting Alaska plates) BOTH had V_at_L stickers on 
them....who owned those two???
