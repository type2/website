So Leong_at_spudboy.baynetworks_dot_com says:
&gt; &gt;(blah, blah)... 5 cylinders right?, just like the
&gt; &gt;later vanagons... so power is probably equal..
&gt; 
&gt; YIKES!  I'd like to have Steven Johnson jump up and tell us his '91 Westy
&gt; has 5 cylinders!  

Nope.  Last time I counted, there were only 4.  Hey!  Why am I being dragged
in to this anyway?  How many of you remember the saga.....  We don't want
to dig that up again do we?  ;)
