Subject: Vanagon Subwoofer 

Where'd we get these car audio nuts from! Somehow they crawled 
out of a hole in the car audio world and they are here to help us with 
our Vanagons! 

Here's a Vanagon curve ball...

I have a question about where to mount a 
subwoofer in the Vanagon. I propose to mount the subwoofer under the 
front two seats, using the &quot;box&quot; space that exists forward of the battery 
compartments.  I cannot remember the dimensions--
I bet it is about 1/3-1/4 cubic foot. Is there a subwoofer that can work 
effectively with such a small enclosure? This enclosure can be sealed 
tight.

This empty, unused, box area is in my 4x4 Syncro. I am not sure if the 
2WD vanagons have this empty box.

I am also thinking about trying to use the dead air space in the rear 
decklid but don't know if the covering is too flimsy to work well to seal 
out the rear output from a subwoofer or if the cavity itself is big enough.

Let's hear it on subwoofer spots for Vanagon.

I am reluctant to use any of my Westfalia cabinets or the space under 
my rear bench seat because I usually fill these cabinets quite full with 
stuff and don't know how the presence of this stuff would affect the 
sound (by occupying variable amounts of air mass). Also, these cabinets 
are not sealed, and the backwave from a subwoofer would get out, I theorize.

I thought about using the sliding door somehow, but of course, you couldn't 
use it very well when the door was open.
