Subject: water pump

I've got some interesting noises coming from the engine compartment and I 
suspect the water pump.  Very preliminary suspicion here.  There's some 
play in the pully, and a squeal sound that I often associate with water 
pumps, but there's also a lot of rattling and metallic noises.  If 
you've had a water pump problem could you e-mail me with what kinds of 
noises and symptoms you had and how hard it was to fix?  

How about the possibility that it's valve lifters or valves.  Do they sound
clattery? 

Thanks for any hints.  I'm going to try to find time to get out the manual
tonight and look through it, but a head start would be nice.
