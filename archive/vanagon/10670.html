If you're buying it from Ohio, and registering it in Ontario...
You may run into problems importing it.
I don't know if you've looked into this already, but the Govt. is
gonna try to make you pay a good percentage of the purchase price
to get it across the border.

Other than that, I'd say $3000-$3500 is reasonable.
