 Disconnecting the single wire will

Thanks Ken, That info helped me too. Although the guage still won't
work. I think I need to replace the sensor. At least I know the wireing
and the dash guage works.
	Do you know if this test/fix will also work with the fuel sensor? I
have a 87' syncro without the tach. So my temp and fuel guages are on
the right side of the instrument cluster. I've heard various techniques
from pulling the tank, to working from inside the wheel well.

Thanks
Erik
