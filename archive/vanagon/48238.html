Subject: Re: Looking for a VW van

I just saw a good looking 1985 vanagon on the cape last weekend.  I think it
was Mid cape sales, a used car lot on Route 28 in South Yarmouth.  The
vanagon look in good shape and was brown.  I had seating for 9, I haven't
seen one like it before. Automatic and it was 4k, I think.

Hope this was helpfull.
