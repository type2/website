Subject: Re: Lots O Camper Questions and Doubts


O.K., I admit it... I did ponder this issue when we were looking for a
new vehicle.  Then I rented one of these, and quickly found out that
the thing is (BTW, it had less than 7,000 miles on it) almost
impossible to drive in the rain, even at 60 mph!!!  At least the
chrysler whateverBoxes are somewhat driveable (I drove one with the
'sports' handling package -- what a laugh!!!). 

The appeal of the Ford econoline was that it is spacious, (albeit
tacky), parts are cheap, and reasonably rugged.  We ended up buying
the EV, because we decided the rain/snow/sleet/ice safety + good
handling was more important than ease of maintenance and cheap parts.
As it turned out, this was the September of '93, and East Coasters
know what kind of a winter that one was!!!Our assumptions were quickly
validated when we found out that the rain/snow/ice handling of the EV
was as good as (maybe even better than) that of our Audi 5000....

I guess if we had bought the Ford, I'd be terribly tired of it by
now....

 &gt; &gt;  Maybe a Ford Econoline with a good old reliable straight six, and all the &gt; &gt; aftermarket camper junk is the way to go???
