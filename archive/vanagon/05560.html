&gt; Actually, my apologies for sending this to the list (hey... at least it's not
&gt; an &quot;I can post more inane messages than you&quot; post). If the person who totalled

Oh Barry, you're always apologizing.  Just post it and forget it...

&gt; Actually, since we're at it, let me ask about something of a delicate nature.
&gt; Does anyone out there carry a porta-john? Those available commercially seem
&gt; flimsy. I'm 6'4&quot; and 215 lbs and I don't want to gamble on paper thin plastic.
&gt; As near as I can figure, the porta-johns are simply a receptacle to hold a
&gt; large plastic bag and some sort of sewage treatment liquid. If anyone knows
&gt; different please enlighten me. Anyway, If I'm correct, I'm thinking about
&gt; something that might fit in the flip-top storage stool that came with some
&gt; mid-70s buses would look better. Now, has anyone seen one of these items in
&gt; good shape in a salvage yard somewhere? Does anyone have any experience with
&gt; portable toilets?
&gt; 

What you want is a porta-potty.  The one we have actually came with the '74
hardtop camper that we previously owned.  It's great because my wife has to
go fairly often and I hate stopping so frequently.  She just closes all the
drapes and takes her seat.  The one we have is kind of small but adequate.
Easy to clean.  Just dump the refuse into a toilet.  Rinse it out and put
in the chemical and water and you're done.  They make bigger ones.  I don't
see any reason why you'd have trouble using one.  I go on a trip without
it.  It stays in the camper.  If your camper is equipped with a bed, toilet
(porta-potty counts) and a water supply, then it is eligible for an RV
tax deduction.  I found this out from a from of mine and have used it
for a couple years now.  Sears carries a variety of the porta-potty's
in various sizes and features.  I'm sure you could find one to 'fit'
your needs. ;)   

Cheers!
