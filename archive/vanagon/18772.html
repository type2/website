So SStueber_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; Here's a weird one!  Hopefully someone can help me out with it.  The front
&gt; brakes on my bus work just fine for the first five minutes or so of driving.
&gt;  After that they squeal like crazy every time I stop.  I took off both wheels
&gt; and checked them out and the pads are fine (almost new).  Any idea what could
&gt; be causing this horendous noise?  Both wheels squeak.  I'm tempted to just
&gt; replace the pads this weekend even though they look fine and hope that the
&gt; problem goes away.
&gt; 

Get some of the brake squeal goop and put it on the back side of your brake
pads.  That should make the squeal go away.
