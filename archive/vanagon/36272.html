Subject: Subject: Electric Van Conversions?

A friend of mine told me about electric/gasoline hybrids.  The car is powered
by an electric motor, but instead of 1000lbs  of batteries, a few batteries
are supplimented by a motor that runs a generator.  He has a 72 bug yard
ornament that he swears will run again one day as a hybrid.


He was under the impression that a gasoline motor tuned to run one constant
load (a generator) at one speed only, could be *much* more efficient than one
that had to have the capacity to carry a car from stop to 65mph.  
It could turn your average car into a 100mpg+, or so he said. 

Also adresses the very nasty battery disposal problem.

Anybody know how much of the chemical energy stored in gasoline is used by a
standard motor?  5%?  10%? 20%?

Anybody ever heard of these?
