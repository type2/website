Subject: Re: Brake job (1962) - STILL!!!

I've found one place in the UK  that does pre-64 brake stuff - 

front cylinders  L41.12 **each**  (about $60 ??)
rear cylinders   L20 each
shoes all round L61
Grand total of   L265.46  --  that's about $400 ??  Plus postage &amp;
packing....

OUCH.   sounds like your prices are twice what they are here.

Well, if you know what you want, i'd be happy to do a mail order, but someone
in California should get a better price.  
here-
fronts ~ $32
rear     ~$15
shoes       $15 + $10 cores charge

probably $15 shipping
~$220.    but.......

how are your RUBBER HOSES?
