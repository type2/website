Subject: new old member and rusty tanks


        Well hello all.  It has been about a year and a half since I last
subscribed to this list and I DID miss it.  Last time I was living in my 82
Westy and going to school.  Now I live and work in Berkeley and drive North
every weekend for a little camping.  No commuting in the Vanagon, yuk, what
gas milage in town.
        And what good news am I greeted with on my first day back?  Rust on
the top of the tank.  I noticed a bit of a gas smell when I buoght it about
4 years ago, but not very often.  This summer it got bad enough that I
could see gas streaks down the side of the tank through the wheel well
(passenger side).  I bought the filler tank grommet as well as two for the
expansion tank tubes.  I was planning to drop the tank this weekend, but
now...
        Did you know that there are three sizes for the filler grommet?
All of which occur in 82? Yuk again.
        I will bore you all with details later as well as some tech
questions after i figure out the FAQ thing.
        E. Walt
