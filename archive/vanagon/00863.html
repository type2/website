Subject: Re: location of vacuum hose????

&gt; I accidently dissconnected the vacuum hose from my EGR valve on my 76 van.
&gt; I looked, but I couldn't find where the other end goes!  Somewher near the
&gt; intake air manifold/distributor, I think.  Regardless, my EGR has been
&gt; disconnected from the exhaust for years, it's just that I am losing vacuum.
&gt; I can even hear the air his when I run the engine.

Follow that hiss!  That'll be where the hose gose.
