Subject: Want a visit?

Hey now,
     Having spent 3 unplanned days in a motel in Victorvile (didn't know my
friend hasn't yet gotten a permanant residence yet), we find outselves a bit
poor. So, if anyone between Fort Bragg and Portland wants to put a couple of
travellers up for the night, we'd sure be happy to impose.   ;-) Email access
is a bit scetchy right now, so we may not have a chance to check it until
Portland, but if we do we'd love to visit...
Peace,
Eddie
