i've driven from Calgary Alberta to Whitehorse Yukon a number times, and
the worst place for wildlife is between Fort Nelson and Watson Lake
(in the Muncho/Stone Mountain park)

and the worst time is about a month ago...the animals come out of the 
woods to lick salt off of the road, completely oblivious, 
lick, lick, lick...smack!!!

sheep aren't so bad, but MOOSE???

one time is was driving north in my Honda CRX (cruis'n speed ~ 140kph),
and i came around one corner in the middle of the night and there where
5-6 of them in the middle of the road, licking salt - i had the
wheels locked, everyone screaming, just missed them...
then, after i got my hands pryed off of the steering wheel, i thought, 
gee, if i didn't slow down, i would take out them spindly legs and be far 
beyond the mass of the moose before it hit the ground, hitting them as 
slow speed in my CRX would result in the mass of the moose flopping 
on my head!!!
didn't have a chance to test my theory.
