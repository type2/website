     Jeff,
     
     It should be noticably cooler in a half hour, or so, on propane.  Do 
     you see a pilot light in the little hole in the bottom inside left 
     corner of the fridge on?  Does the fridge led light up on the control 
     panel?  Have you tried plugging into 110 VAC to see if it works on 
     household AC?
     
     The battery will not cool very well if you turn it on when warm.  The 
     best performance from the battery is achieved by &quot;pre-cooling&quot; with 
     110 AC or by running on propane.
     
     Best bring the beers over to my house for safe keeping 'till you get 
     the fridge working!  %-)
     
     Hope this helps.

Greetings,
     
How long should it take for the fridge to cool?  Or even start cooling 
enough to be able to tell its working?  I cant seem to get the damn 
thing working on my new westie with either the duel battery or 
propane...  its friday afternoon, have to chill the brews!
     
peace,
     
jeff
