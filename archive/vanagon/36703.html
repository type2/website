Subject: Re: ref Thom's 'family tree'

A family tree with no &quot;splits&quot; is definitly a bad sign.

Like Joel - I think his family tree only has bricks!  Does that make it a
family &quot;stump?&quot;

Steve Johnson's family tree has only recently split!

NewNote:  There was a blurb in the paper recently about a &quot;family&quot; in the
south: a brother and sister had 9, countem (base 10) nine kids together.
The particular court case the article was about was thrown out because they
couldn't prove that the most recent kids were concieved in that county.
True Story.

So I guess its legal so long as you don't get pregnant then, eh?
