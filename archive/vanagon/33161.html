Subject: The Flat Spot

Hey now,
        The last spate of postings has made me finally come to grips with
the ubiquitous flat spot. I do believe I now have a clue, and I think I'm
afflicted. Here's my symptoms: Idle wanders a little bit, maybe50 rpm
either way of perfect. Upon acceleration, around 3000 rpm the engine spits
and sputters, once past the sputter point it runs good. It will continue to
run well until it is given a chance to slow down to 1000 rpm or so, then it
all starts over again. My way around this has historically been to rev the
engine over 3000, then let it drop down a bit and start letting out the
clutch. Seems to work well, but I have always known it was not cool, just
couldn't figure out what to do. The recent change from the 34p3 to the
borsal 30/31p seems to have helped some. So do I need to dump the 009, and
will that make me live happier ever after?

Peace,
