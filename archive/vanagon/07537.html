To the list:

I have had my 1985 Vanagon GL just under a month now--it hasn't done 
anything terrible to me yet.  I've put about 1,000 miles on it, it seems 
to have all the oil it had when I picked it up, it seems to be holding 
coolant/antifreeze (although green).  And I have not reset the idle yet 
with the idle stabilization unit connecters connected together and the 
idle is fluctuating some, but not much.  My gas mileage in moderate 
Atlanta traffic is around 17.5 MPG, respectable considering my '92 Passat 
does about 22-23 on the same drill.

Mostly what I have been trying to do is get the thing cleaned out, I 
haven't finished completely because it was really filthy but I have 
manage to get the dashboard wiring back to where it was, all the 
dashboard lights work and I have a brand new set of heater/ventilation 
knobs effective today and the new brake and clutch pedal covers for the 
ones that were not there (I was scratching up those nasty dress shoes I 
make myself wear to work).  BTW thanks to Mr. Stone in the People's 
Republic of Scarberia ;-)  for the Wiring Diagrams.

I do need to know how to get the middle seat out of this thing to finish 
cleaning up the carpet, I've given up trying to do it in the car, this is 
garden hose and dry in the sunshine work.  Previous owners were hauling 
well-behaved cattle.  The interior is very dirty but physically in very 
good shape.

Tomorrow I get serious, oil change with filter, timing (sorry will have 
to use the dash tachometer, my old one might fry the hall unit), idle 
setting (the right way according to the Bentley manual), and the 
coolant.  I bought two gallons of Sierra, a flush tee, downloaded a copy 
of the FAQ.

Anyone have any final warnings, or pearls of wisdom before I start all 
this stuff tomorrow afternoon?  Expecially on the coolant stuff--It seems 
like a daunting process--at least my driveway goes up hill!--
