&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. The air conditioning is sub-marginal. Cold air on the back of the neck,
&gt; &gt;&gt; no air to the face.

&gt; &gt;	The A/C is pretty poor especially in hot weather and a complete waste
&gt; &gt;	with passengers in the back seat in hot weather. They sit under all that
&gt; &gt;	noise while the driver+ sweats.
&gt; &gt;	If I had kept mine, I had planned to port the right-most duct into the
&gt; &gt;	side vent nearby, seal off the fresh air intake in the grill and use
&gt; &gt;	the ventilation ducts to route cool air to the dash.
&gt; 
&gt; the only problem i can see with this idea is the distinct possibility of
&gt; condensation on the metal ... rusting the roof out from the inside. if you
&gt; could manage to plastic-coat it somehow, or run some plastic tubing ...
&gt; 
&gt; in the pictures in the german books i've seen, there are buses with the
&gt; a/c vent running along the sides of the roof ... so they can have front face
&gt; air AND the sunroof (or camper). :(    why do they get all the good stuff? :(

Actually, the air being discharged from the A/C vents should be pretty 
dry.  Most of the moisture will be condensed out when the air passes 
across the A/C evaporator coil.  As the air travels through the duct it 
will warm slightly, bringing the residual moisture content well below 
dew-point and avoiding any further condensation.
