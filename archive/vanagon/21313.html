&gt;&gt;P.s.  Thinking of calling her &quot;Old Bessie.&quot;  Any comments? :-)
&gt;
&gt;sure. and if you are into latin music, you could also call her
&gt;
&gt;Bessie, me Mucho.
&gt;
&gt;:)
&gt;

Ok I'm inspired now...


Bessie me
Bessie me Mucho
Each time I cling to your wheel I hear music divine...
So Bessie me mucho, 
Run for forever 
And say that you'll always be mine...

This drive is something new, 
Aircooled enfolding you,
Never such noises before,
Who ever thought I'd be 
Splitting an engine case
Washing off oil from my floor.

Dearest bus,
If you should valve drop,
I'd cry out &quot;NO!&quot;
Feel your heat, 
And my life would be through..

So Bessie me mucho
Run for forever
And keep all your valve train in time...
