Subject: Netsurfnugen...

	Well, I for one think the flannel antenna flag / mirror decoration
is THE sign of a vanagon list person, but I'll be happy to have
a sticker too- a prune would be a good symbol, but its even
more in-jokey than the flannel. On the other hand, prunes ARE readily
available... but who would recognize one on a sticker??

	I like the rhythm of NetSurfNugen, the bus/turtle
idea, the VW with a II superimposed over it (VW II - Judgement Day? :-) )

	In keeping with the nature of this list, if everyone used
a piece of reflective tape, of different size, shape, color and 
decoration, I wouldn't be half surprised. 

	How about using the classic T1 nose as the basis of a design,
available on flannel at extra charge, in red and white (and doable
using reflective tape and any generic VW sticker...

	My replacement battery tray part arrived from Bus Boys today.
Pretty thing- dark red, shiny, primer. Will talk to my friend we welds
this weekend. Bus Boys gets $75 for it, Bus Stop gets $69.95 for theirs.
I wonder if its the same part from the same supplier? Any way, I
think I saved the $5 difference by buying front turn signal gaskets from
Bus Buys, for $2.75 each as opposed to the $5.50 I recall other
places. 

	I try all the suppliers once, as long as prices aren't nuts.

	Will I get any work done today at all??

	Cheers, all!
