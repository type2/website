Subject: shipping wheels

I was wondering if anybody had any preferences of any low priced shipping
Co's or other means of shipping items such as used auto parts cross country.

I'm looking for the cheapest way possible. Train? Truck? I even heard you
could ship stuff via Greyhound bus too...

any suggestions or experiences with a particular company would be welcome.

TIA
chris
