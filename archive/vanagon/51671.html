Subject: Caravelle Futura

Got a broschure from my local VW today. Saw a new eurovan called 
caravelle futura. It should be the most luxury eurovan now. Only four 
seats, two at the back with arm and legrests, and two turnable 
frontseats. On the opposite side of the sliding door, foldable glass 
table ;-) minibar and place for phones computers, VCR and TV set. All 
seats and interior in light brown leather. The van showed was high gloss 
black and discreet alu wheels..

I remembered that Jim Davis had a vanagon lim.ed. with legrests, now I 
know something about how they look.
