&gt;  As still a &quot;rookie&quot; owner, I have been learning more and more
&gt;about NuBus' ('82) affect on other drivers. IT DRIVES THEM INSAAAANNEE.

Get used to it, you aren't mistaken!

&gt;Two theories

Looks like 3?

&gt; 1)Its a bunker-burner, and people can't stand the diesel exhaust

I certainly don't like diesel fumes, Vanagon or anything else.

&gt; 2)People can't see over or around it. I actually see them driving
&gt;   straddling the double yellow line in my side mirror.

May be.

&gt; 3)People get *very* frustrated over slow acceleration. (Hey, I make
&gt;   it to &quot;speed_limit+5&quot;, but it takes a little while to get there)

Even worse, people just expect that you are slow and accelerate slowly.  In 
my Vanagon I have a much greater frequency of drivers passing me and slowing 
down in front of me, sometimes several times in a single encounter, than in 
other vehicles I drive.  Often this occurs when I am driving just as fast as 
any other car on the road.  I have a steep hill I drive just about every 
day. I can hold 50 in 3rd gear (just about the typical ambient speed).  I 
often see some Honda driver in the mirror with an &quot;Oh no, that big lumbering 
slow thing got in front of me, now I'm gonna have to wait&quot; reaction.  It's 
fun to steadily pull away from them on the hill.
