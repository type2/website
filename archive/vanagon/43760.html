Subject: bleeder question

Thanks to all who replied about my coolant bleeding question. There is no
need to bleed the system, as I was just asking out of curiosity. I did
neglect to say that the coolant system was just redone (heads, gaskets,
waterpump, coolant, etc..) I will be getting the bentley as soon as
possible. Again thanks.
