&gt; #2 is more correct, because the pans are not limited to '67. Bob and I seem
&gt; to have very similar panel vans, neither of which are '67s, and both of
&gt; which are reinforced with the belly pans.

Yup.  My '57 23-Window has them.

Question:  Do all buses have the pan that fits over the master 
cylinder area.  My '67 doesn't, and the '57 does.  Is it part of the 
belly pan package?

&quot;Yes, I'd like to order the belly pan package.&quot;

&quot;Why certainly, would you care for any ketchup with that?&quot;
