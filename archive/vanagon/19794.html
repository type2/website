&gt; Howdy everyone!  I just got back on the list after a
&gt; long absence caused by moving from Virginia to Texas.
&gt; The list sure has grown in the meantime.  Anyway, here's
&gt; my question...has anyone out there ever done a conversion
&gt; of a bus to an electric vehicle?  Or do you know someone
&gt; who has?  I've been considering resurrecting one of the 
&gt; lonely busses down at the junkyard and converting it to 
&gt; an electric, but I wanted to find any information or even
&gt; plans (if someone here has done it before) on the best
&gt; way to go about it.  I found that they're willing to sell
&gt; a decent bus body, clutch and transmission minus the engine
&gt; for about $200-300, so I'm seriously considering it.  It'd
&gt; be great to be cruisin' down the road in a bus that's 
&gt; completely silent and see the puzzled looks on people's 
&gt; faces!  ;)  If you have any experience with this sort of
&gt; conversion please, please help me out!
&gt; 
While I have no experience, I recall seeing somewhere an article from
the late 60's of a race between teams from MIT and some school I believe
in Cal.The Cal. team had an electric Sunroof Deluxe, which of course won
the race hands down! If this could be done then, I would imagine with
today's technology, it could certainly be done.
