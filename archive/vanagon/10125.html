&gt;Do the plastic (that used to look like chrome) strips that are inlayed in
&gt;the window seals on my '85 Vanagon serve any useful purpose?  They have
&gt;discolored and look kind of nasty now and I'd like to just take them out.

Nope, thems just thar to look purty.  You will have a gap for a while, until
the rubber shrinks back down and fills it.  It won't leak though.

er ah be careful bunkie...

That funny little trim strip is a compression device that keeps the rubber
window seal in.  To remove the window easily, pick out the trim and simply push
gently on the window from the inside or even from the outside.  If the trim
is not installed the window seal is &quot;unlocked&quot; and can fall or be pushed out
very easily as the only thing holding it is stiction from the old rubber to
the body paint/rust.  With the trim installed, you've gotta break the window
to get it out.  Ask any of Thom's &quot;friends on the street&quot; who visit his bus
on occasion.
