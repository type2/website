Subject: Re: Why gas taxes should be higher...

I've long believed that U.S. gasoline taxes should be several dollars /
gallon.  This would come closer to covering the government subsidies on
automobiles.  It would also discourage driving, always a good thing.
- - -  -

but if you drive a 30 year old car, the subsidies are irrelevant.  why not
reduce car subsidies?  did you know that a third of the pollution that a car
makes in its'lifetime' is in production?    but actually, gas prices haven't
gone up that much, compared to other things.

i used to bike everywhere, and only drive when i went out of town, or to haul
stuff.   there is a lot more of that that could be done.    are you fighting
against car potatoism?
