Subject: Re: Adjustable Push Rod &quot;O-rings&quot;

Does anyone have a source for &quot;O-rings&quot; for the adjustable pushrods.  I
just checked with Camelback VW and they told me the o-rings were
unavailable.  Also called VW Customer Service:  they said essentially tough
luck - buy the whole unit when the o-rings leak.  Refused to give me a
number for a VW Tech Rep - said they only deal with VW dealers.

By the way, I just received word from German Transaxle of America where I
sent my transaxle for some warrenty work and the Weddle Locker.  Turns out
after they installed the locker, Weddle called and said he had a bad batch
of gears - improper heat treat - so I'm down for another week or so, until
Weddle can deliver some acceptable parts.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Fred
