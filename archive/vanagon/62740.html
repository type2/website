Subject: Re: Screw extractors any good?

Mark,

You Said,

&gt;The next step is to have a shop weld a bolt head onto the allen head and go
&gt;from their.
&gt;IMHO the hammer blows and the heat are equally important as having a good
&gt;secure head to wrench connection. Heat does wonders and is the final word
&gt;in loosing.  We call it the &quot;flame wrench&quot;. Hammer blows do miracles too.
&gt;Why? I don't exactly know, but I've seen stuff drop off just by hitting it
&gt;and waiting. Go figure.

I think I might try this, I could either weld a bolt head or weld my rough
homemade 9mm allen wrench to what is left of the head of the original allen
bolt.  I have access to a gas welder so this just might work.  I was using
a allen type socket wrench but as soon as I would torque the bolt the
wrench would loose its grip and pop out.  The allen bolt is pretty deformed
from all my attempts.  I just hope that I can get a good enough weld to
torque on the bolt to get it out.

Thanks for the suggestion.
