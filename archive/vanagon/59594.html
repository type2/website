Subject: Re: Smog Check in the Field

In the early 70's the CHP used to set up check points, besides the lights
and such they used to stick an emissions tester up the tail pipe. I have
fond memories of avoiding them, or maybe it was the '59 I was driving then,
or maybe that I remember way back then....

&gt;I observed a roadside (yes, from a fixed location) 
&gt;dyno smog test on a front wheel drive vehicle.  Extra fan pointed to 
&gt;the front of the vehicle to assist in cooling.  This was in Auburn, 
&gt;California, on April 29th.  Auburn is about 60 miles NE from Sacramento.
