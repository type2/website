So Albrecht Jander says:
&gt; 
&gt; I love this list.  I have a major problem and am too embarased to mention
&gt; it because I attributed it to my supreme incompetence, and a week later it 
&gt; shows up on the list!!  Really makes a guy feel much better about himself to 
&gt; see others with the same problems.  CV Joints Anon. sound like the place for me.
&gt;  

I'm sure we could compile quite a list of 'boners' everyone has pulled when
doing work on there beloved beasts from this list.  I know I've done my
fair share.  DOH!
