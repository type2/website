Subject: Care and feeding of pilot bearings


When replacing a pilot bearing, are there any special tricks or conditions
one should be aware of? My old one's probably in little pieces by now, but
assuming that the crank and trans input shaft are OK, how exactly does
one install the new one? I would assume:

1.) Pack it well with grease (what kind???), similar to a wheel bearing,
2.) Press it into the hole, maybe using a block of hard wood or flat
    piece of copper or aluminum, and a mallet,
3.) Grease end of trans input shaft and interior of pilot bearing,
4.) Install engine/clutch assembly onto trans shaft and tranny.

Did I leave out anything important?

BTW, is the pilot bearing a real tight press fit into the flywheel (or
is it the crank?)? Or does it install fairly easily? Anyone know of
any uh-ohs that might bite the unwary?

Last but not least, where exactly does the pilot bearing mount on a
normal '80 Vanagon? One person told me it's in a hole in the end of the
crankshaft, and another has said that it's in a hole in the flywheel.
Being a type-4 ignoramous myself, I have no way of knowing, until I
drop the relevant part on my foot. Anyone know for sure?

Thanks again, all...
