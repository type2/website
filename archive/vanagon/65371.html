Subject:      VC failure FOUND

I removed the driveshaft yesterday, and found one u joint that was seized
along 1 axis.  It would only move about 20 degrees either way.  No wonder
the thing shook!!  I hope the trans case wasn't damaged, as it is wet near
the output flange.
Thanks to all who replied

Does anyone know about those u joints?  Can they be replaced?
