Oh, could be lots of reasons. Maybe they didn't quite get as much out of them.
Carter VW in Seattle likes to bring those things in from out of the area
too, because they sell so well out here.

&gt;When you compare the EV Camper with a Vanagon Westy you will find

&gt;of people like me use old (Vanagon) models which are less expensive
&gt;and offer more room and do their camper conversion themself. That's
&gt;my thoughts.
&gt;

As an ex-owner of a 1980 Camper I can assure you that the EV Camper
has a lot more room! Is it &quot;high comfort&quot;? I wouldn't say so - I thought
that the '80 was nearly as comfortable (but spend a stormy night cooped up
in it and you'll see how much smaller it is.) It goes faster though, I
don't have to watch the gauges when driving out in the desert or over the
mountains, and the
fridge (and furnace) light a lot more easily!
The '80 had its storage in different spots - more easily accessible from
the inside than the out. But you open that rear hatch and there's a lot of
room
behind the rear seat! And you can get to it from the inside, just a little
more awkward. About the only place in the '80 that was bigger was the width
of the bed - the EV beds are a couple of inches narrower.
Finally, my wife likes it a lot better - a big plus when you're trying to
decide if/where to go out on Friday night.

Anyway, I had to respond defensively to the sweeping generalizations being
made.
At this time I'm simply lucky enough to be able to afford one of these things.
It comes and goes. There were times when I didn't make as much as this
thing cost in a year! (Actually 2 years now that I think about it!)
But I figure that if I can get 10-15 years out of it at least, it will have
been worth the expense. Its also nice knowing that the thing has been cared
for properly from the beginning.
