&gt; &gt;By the way, the best price I could find for a replacement mirror (glass only)
&gt; &gt;was $20.  Anyone else bought one for a better price? (go ahead...break my
&gt; &gt;heart).

&gt; i think i still have an old right side non-power mirror. $10? i already sold
&gt; the drivers side to a guy in oregon.  lemme know if you want it. i'll check
&gt; and make sure, but i'm pretty certain the only one remaining is the right
&gt; side. :)

If your looking for just the glass for a non-power mirror I'll send 
mine for free. I need the whole mirror, the bolt has pulled out of 
the housing and can't be tightened any more. it just flaps in the 
breeze... Joel I'll give you $10 if its the same as my 87's and I'll 
send Gerald mine. If he just needs the glass.
