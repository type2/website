I'm shopping for a VDO Oil Pressure Gauge and have noticed that most 
vendors offer both an 80psi and a 150psi model.
I'd like to hear opinions on which I should get and why...

Also, I found a listing for &quot;100psi Oil Pressure Gauge (Mechanical)&quot;
What is the difference between this one and the regular ones?
