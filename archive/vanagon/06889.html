&gt;
&gt;I DISAGREE Joel, you are completely WRONG!!!
&gt;
&gt;First one sniggling little point, according to the UMass Dartmouth Department
&gt;of Redundancy Department:  Ph.D. degrees is a redundant statement.
&gt;
&gt;Second. J.D. degrees (redundant) or Law Degrees for the uninitiated are
&gt;given ONLY to the most &quot;tenacious and obnoxious of spirit and manner&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Please correct this impression on any further discussion of the point!
&gt;
&gt;Very truly yours.

I always thought Ph.D. stands for Doctor of Philosophy (in latin, of
course) and J.D. stands for Juris Doctor (this one is latin, or so I'm
told).
