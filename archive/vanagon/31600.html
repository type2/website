&gt;Derek,
&gt;        After reading your latest e-mail, I can understand your
&gt;circumstances for needing different charging rates.  Hey, you guys must
&gt;really like roughing-it!!  First I was unaware that the original wiring was
&gt;not heavy enough to handle the current and it looks like you are on the
&gt;right track by adding the extra wiring.  If you are interested in the
&gt;Transpo IB370A adjustable regulator, I can sell them to you for $19.95 ea.
&gt;plus shipping.  As far as an adjustable regulator that could be adjusted
&gt;from the dash, I believe that may be a possibilty.  I have an adjustable
&gt;regulator that is used on Fords that I think I can redesign to be controlled
&gt;remotely.  It would require replacing the existing regulator on the
&gt;alternator with a brushholder assembly and mounting a Ford adjustable
&gt;regulator wherever it would be convinent.  We could then set up remote knob
&gt;at the dash to control the regulator.  I have never done this type of setup
&gt;before, but I believe it can be done with out to much problem.  If you are
&gt;interested, I would set up a rig like this on our test bench and try it out.
&gt;You understand that this project would be strictly experimental!!  In any
&gt;case, it would be a good idea to install a voltmeter on the dash to monitor
&gt;your charging voltage.  We are an Interstate Battery dealer and I am going
&gt;to contact them as to the voltages that a deep-cycle battery can handle.
&gt;Will let know what they say. 
&gt;I have never used the PGP to send credit card info over the net either. I
&gt;think that getting an order form on our web page might be one of my next
&gt;projects. It might be best if you just faxed us the order with your card
&gt;number and expiration date. Our fax number is 1-815-626-5560 and our phone
&gt;number is 
&gt;1-815-626-8949 if you want to call me.  
&gt;                                        Thanks again.
&gt;                                        Gary Heide
