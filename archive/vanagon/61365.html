Subject: Dreams about a future VW T5 synchro &quot;bus&quot;
Date: Fri, 13 Jun 97 14:18:33 EDT

So how about some dreaming about this future VW T5 synchro &quot;bus&quot;?

I looked at these links that Tom gave us:

&gt; May have been a VW LT 4x4 or a Volvo Lapplander or a Steyr-Puch Pinzgauer 

&gt; Chek out the following links:

&gt; see Volvo c202

I've driven the Volvo 4x4 and 6x6's. These are very capable
vehicles. They have huge tractor-type tires, 6 cyl mid mounted engine,
pneumatic diff locks, and are much more capable off road than the
Vanagon. Still they were never a commercial success. Except for
a few sold as service vehicles to, for instance, utility companies
I seldom saw any in civilian use.

I like the design choices Volvo made, but their implementation is
probably a too large and expensive series of vehicles to appeal to a
mass market. The smallest one (the &quot;valp&quot;=puppy which was mentionen in
another post) might have been ok, but the larger TGB 13 and 20 are big
trucks. (TGB 20 loads a 16 man troup with all equipment in the
military).

My preference would be to go smaller, more like something between the
Haflinger and the present Vanagon, that is perhaps the size and
weight of the T1, but in a modern form.

So how about:

Take the basic drive train out of a Golf synchro. Keep the transverse
engine, but flipped around behind the driver in a forward cab,
mid engine design. Put everying into a body which size and shape
wise would be a cross between a Haflinger and a Vanagon. Put
on good size tires (maybe with reduction boxes one can keep all
the stard golf tranny and diff components). Make it in roughly 
the same styles as the busses (Caravelle, Transporter, Singlecab.

Result would (hopefully) be:

A lightweight (about the same as a golf), potent 4x4. Forward
cab gives it about the same interior space as a splittie.
Keeping it high retains the safety of the vanagon (assuming
the other guy is the idiot, doesn't help when you hit a rock wall).

Market: Vanagon list type people, but also a lot of service functions
where today small tractors are used. Several body styles and
engine alternatives (all the Golf ones: VR6, 16V, 2.0, 1.8, 1.9TDI
1.9SDI, 1.9IDI), should appeal to a broad market. A common platform
keeps the costs down in mass production.

So what do you think? Should I send this to &quot;Gute Fahrt&quot;?

PS While waiting for the T%, can someone tell me how much a
restorable Haflinger costs, and where I need to look for them?
Do people generally keep these registered?
