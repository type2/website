Subject: NEED: Heater boxes for a '74 bus


hey now,

i'm looking for a pair of heater boxes for a '74 bus. i've got a pair to 
put on my rebuild but i'm not satisfied with them, i figure they'll only 
last a couple of years at most. even with cleaning them up and stuff. 
anyone have a good condition pair for sale?
