&gt;There *is* no number one.  Well, there's the
&gt;flat part, and the pin that connects it to the connecting rod, but
&gt;there's nothing else.  No sides, no skirt.  What's left is flopping
&gt;around pretty loose on the end of the connecting rod.

I'm having trouble understanding. The sides of the actual piston were gone?
Your entire piston had disintegrated except the face?

If this is correct...has anybody else ever seen this? Sheez, I thought I
knew everything that could blow up in a 1600. Bizarre.
