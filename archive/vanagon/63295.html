&gt;
&gt;      Well yes-
&gt;
&gt;      Nothing about the grille.  But the headlights themselves would have
a
&gt;      &quot;reversed&quot; beam pattern.  In drive-on-the-right countries (including

&gt;      the US and continental Europe), the high-beam is usually shifted to
&gt;      the left (as well as &quot;up&quot;) in comparison to the low-beam.  The
&gt;      drive-on-the-left comparison (UK, South Africa, Japan, ANZUS) would
&gt;      have the pattern shift to the right.
&gt;
&gt;      Also, with regard to Euro-spec lenses (L- or RHD), these usually
have
&gt;      a very sharp cutoff pattern on low beam.  If you shine the
headlights
&gt;      (euro-spec, drive-on-the-right) on a garage door or similar, you see
a
&gt;      light pattern like this (bad ASCII art alert!):
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;         (dark)  /| (dark) /|
&gt;         ______/  |______/  |
&gt;
&gt;                light
&gt;
&gt;      The angled-up cutoff allows light to shine further down the right
side
&gt;      (shoulder) of the road.  On good lenses (Cibie comes to mind), the
&gt;      cutoff is very dramatic; you could almost use it as a guide to draw
a
&gt;      straight line on the garage door!  Naturally, drive-on-the-left
lights
&gt;      are opposite.
&gt;
&gt;      US-spec low beam patterns are less defined, and frankly emit a lot
of
&gt;      blinding light where it isn't needed or wanted (except on
&gt;      luminescently-challenged overhead freeway signs, trees (helps the
&gt;      squirrels find midnight snacks), and low-flying aircraft).  When
&gt;      euro-spec lights having the above beam pattern are properly
adjusted,
&gt;      virtually no blinding light is emitted at oncoming traffic or in the

&gt;      rear view mirror of other cars ahead in the same lane.
&gt;
&gt;      Note that there are likely exceptions to the above; this is not
&gt;      intended to be the definitive &quot;primer&quot; on euro-spec lighting, just a

&gt;      collection of my observations from having lived in Europe two years
&gt;      and made several subsequent visits.  But I have used euro-spec 7&quot;
&gt;      round Cibie conversions on a Baja bug and seen the exact beam
pattern
&gt;      shown above.  I also have Euro-spec tungsten-bulb &quot;buckets&quot; on my
'66
&gt;      Bus which exhibit this characteristic (although the left lens is
&gt;      evidently a British version as it has the cutoff running just the
&gt;      opposite - fortunately the tungsten bulbs are not too bright, and I
&gt;      have the reflectors adjusted to lower the beam - when I hit the high

&gt;      beams on this one, they both head toward the center of the road -
&gt;      &quot;cross-eyes&quot;).
&gt;
&gt;      I also have a pair of 7&quot; Cibie Z-beams - these have a fairly sharp
&gt;      cutoff and a slight shift to the left on high-beam, but the beam
&gt;      pattern is more symetrical.

&gt; I'm not sure what that has to do with the headlights and grill tho'.
&gt;
&gt; Am I missing something?

&gt; &gt;      But-
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      They drive on the left side of the street in S.A., right?  Gotta

&gt; &gt; Wasn't Chris Turner (JordanVW_at_aol_dot_com) talking about organizing a group

&gt; buy
&gt; &gt; of these from South Africa?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe we could shame him into getting back into the game ;-&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;      Does anyone out there have a line on getting Euro-spec
headlights
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt;      the late Vanagon?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;      I don't want to go retro to round lights (always wanted a
Vanagon
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt;      rectangulars).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;      Do our Canadian friends suffer with the same S.A.E.-approved
junk
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt;      we have?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;      Anyone in Europe with access to a few good wrecking yards want
to
&gt; go
&gt; &gt; &gt;      into business?
