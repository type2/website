Subject: Re: Vanagon 84: Water Coolant Reservoir




&gt;1. Anyway, can someone fax me the instructions from the Bentley manual
&gt;for replacing both the engine coolant reservoirs?  My fax is at
&gt;408-495-3097.

If you still need this, I can fax it to you.


&gt;2. The dealer is asking for $60.00! (yipes!) for this coolant reservoir,
&gt;I haven't found a Vanagon in the junk yard, and the dealer has to
&gt;special order.  I've looked at the Web Pages for Vanagons, and there are
&gt;several choices for Wholesale parts.  Are we allowed (as end-users) to
&gt;call these factories/distributors?  Otherwise, anyone know a reputable
&gt;place I can either mail-order one or is located in the SF Bay Area?  

I am parting out an '85 Westy Vanagon.  Could sell you a used reservoir for 
$25 plus UPS.  Alternatively, you could try Volks Cafe in Santa Cruz.
&gt;
&gt;3. Also, I'd like to purchase a Bentley manual. Is the Bentley the only
&gt;one available?  Whether Bentley or another manual, where did you
&gt;purchase your manual?  I think that the Bentley is being sold at $89.95,
&gt;kind of expensive compared to my other car manuals ($39.95, $59.95,
&gt;etc.).  Anyone know where I can get any detailed manual at a cheap(er)
&gt;price?  

There is no other manual for the water-cooled Vanagon.  Haynes only covers 
air-cooled and Chilton is useless.  However, I sell Bentley Vanagon manuals 
to list members for $66 plus shipping ($4.75 to West Coast).  I believe 
this is the lowest price around.
