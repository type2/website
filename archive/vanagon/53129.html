Subject: Giving the archive thang another try...


As many of you who read the archives are aware, they've been off again for
the past several days.  I've been manually feeding the messages into the
archiving software but only doing it once a day or so.

(Geek alert!) 

I fixed another egregious bug in the archiver.  It wasn't locking the
directory.  I believe some of the problems I was seeing with the archiver
were because multiple copies were running and stepping on one another's
toes.  I fixed that problem.  We'll see if things work a little better.

Once again, if you notice any problems with list archives (type2 or
vanagon), let me know and I'll take a look.

Sorry for the continued inconvenience.
