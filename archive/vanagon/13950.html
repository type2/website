Subject: Exploding Release Bearings

This is a continuation of the thread titled &quot;Do I Have the Wrong Pressure
Plate?&quot;

One thing that I noticed about my release bearing is that the OEM clips
that hold the release bearing to the cross-shaft fork were very flimsy.

The clips may have been worn out to the point where they no longer held the
release bearing on the fork, and needed to be replaced.  I had no
replacement clips when I fixed my clutch for the third time.  The release
bearing seemed to be rather loose, and the clips only &quot;sort of&quot; held the
bearing in place.  

I ordered several sets of replacement release bearing clips from Rocky
Mountain Motorworks (The Bus Stop).  These replacement clips are HEAVY DUTY
because of the thicker gauge wire used in their manufacture.  The OEM clips
look like cheap little paper clips in comparison.  I am hoping that these
replacement clips do a better job in securing the release bearing so that
the bearing does not come loose and destroy itself.
