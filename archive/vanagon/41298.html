&gt;
&gt;&gt;Any advice on rebuilding/replacing Vanagon automatics?  There may be a
&gt;&gt;few in the local boneyards if mine is beyond repair.  What kind of costs
&gt;&gt;can I expect??  Any input welcome.  Thanks.
&gt;
&gt;I'm assuming that the differential section is ok and the tranny section has
&gt;bled to death.  I want you to know that the vanagon shared the same basic
&gt;automatic tranny with the Rabbit, Golf, Jetta, Later Bus, Audis 4000 (both
&gt;turbo and non-turbo) and Audis 5000 (both turbo and non-turbo.  The major
&gt;difference is the differentials that they tacked onto them to make them fit
&gt;the different cars.  The minor difference is the size of the clutches and
&gt;other controlling parts inside.  The lightest duty of the trannys is the
&gt;Rabbit.  The most bulletproof is out of the Audi 5000 turbo.  It is the
&gt;strongest longest lasting tranny available for all of these cars.  I would
&gt;suggest finding one in a junkyard and getting a guarrantee on it.  I would
&gt;not consider rebuilding one myself, and I am a VW Audi mechanic.  It's just
&gt;too much trouble to risk the kind of failure that can cost you bunches of
&gt;money and time.  My advice is to simply buy a known-good unit and swap it
&gt;yourself.  Just make sure that your differential hasn't crapped out on you
&gt;first.  You'll be reusing it if you cross-breed.
&gt;
You mention its the same on vanagons and later busses, this includes my 76?

If so, they have to be different in more than just the differential,
because my tranny is in two parts, one in front of the differential and the
other between the differential and the engine.  I'll be darned if know how
that works and why they did it, I've been afraid to look.  But this
summer's the time; she's leaking way too much...
