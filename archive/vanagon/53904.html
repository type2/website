Well, there should be a way of just counting the pulses of the negative 
side of the coil, like most tach's do...but, on tthe other hand..

in my digikey catalog:

&quot;Tachometer Counter

Omron's self powered tachometer is completely selectable for RPM or RPS 
measurement. [wouldnt we all love to know exactly how many rotations per 
second...:] On board rotary switches allow you to set your 
multiplier/divider network. Tachometer reads up to 10KHz maximum.

[blahblah stats you can ask for if you want them..]

Max counting speed 1kcps - Gate time- 1 second  10kcps - gate time 
1second...&quot;


5 diget lcd display, .2&quot; high (display that is..:)

runs off DC pulses...would be a fun toy fer a car..:)

anyhow,

part#  Z869-ND

price? 1- 87.38
25- 2022.75
50- 3775.80


expensive little toy, eh?:)

but nice....


later...david
