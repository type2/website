	I have a 1977 VW Westfalia pop-up camper in mint condition.
This vehicle has been garage kept since 1977, has a sink, ice box,and
sleeps 4.  Canvas and interior is in excellent shape. Paint looks like
knew. This is a once in a lifetime find! I also have most of the 
records.
If you are interested perhaps I could send a video.

Asking $4,500		86,000 miles

This would be great for &quot;dead heads&quot; or fisherman.

If your interested please e-mail at:

Thanks,
Scott
