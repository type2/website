Subject: The road to Inuvik

I verified today that Inuvik is by a degree or so the farthest point that
one can drive north on a year-'round public road.  Prudhoe Bay is further
north, but the road is closed to the public in the vicinity of Big Lake,
Alaska, slightly south of Inuvik's latitude.  The road continues north from
Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk, but the road is closed in summer, as it goes directly
across the Kugmallit Bay, *without a bridge*.

What's the current trip roster?  Should I set up a web page?  What's the
name of this quest?

Ron
