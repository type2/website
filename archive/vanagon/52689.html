Just read an interesting article in the Dec-2-96 edition of Design 
News.  LuK, Inc., Wooster OH, has designed a self adjusting clutch 
mechanism that looks neat and workable.  An internet search provided 
nothing on the company. 

Any of you in the bizz have contacts to check out if they are going 
to make these for VW's, license the design to others for fab, etc?

Sounds like they are the OEM for this type of product, but being 
based in Ohio they may not think VW (but it was designed in metric 
units tho!)

It isn't on the Design News website yet, but should be soon.  
(they are still at the Nov 18 edition)  but check it out eventually at:
http://www_dot_designnews_dot_com/
and then go the the Design Applications section.
