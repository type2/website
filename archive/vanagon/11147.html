Yay!! Thanks for all the work!

&gt; Anyway, I think this thing is ready for inclusion in a FAQ or the gopher
&gt; site, so if someone would help with that, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks!

I put it as Bus-Vanagon-Literature-Database on the file site -- 
accessible by ftp to lenti.med.umn_dot_edu:/pub/vanagon and gopher to 
halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:/Miscellaneous/Vanagon/Files
