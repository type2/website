Subject: RE: '83 Westie questions

Mike Wynn wants to know what's the metal-to-metal scrape when he turns his
steering wheel.  It's the little brass contact that goes around and around
with the steering wheel, touching a little round track to maintain contact
for the horn button.  When mine got noisy I bent it so that a little bent
curve made the contact, rather than a sharp worn-down edge.  Is there a
better fix?  Other than buying a younger steering wheel at the wrecking
yard?
