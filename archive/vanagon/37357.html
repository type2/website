&gt;Fresh air and bleach/water solution are the best way to get rid of the
&gt;ubiquitious PNW mold/mildew. (My truck is growing algae on it this
&gt;year!) I use the bleach/water followed by a pressure wash on my house
&gt;&amp; decks every year - takes it right off.

How hard is it to remove the canvas, then take the whole top off? I 
might consider this for the summer if it's not *too* tough, then I 
could scrub (or pressure wash!!) without worrying about the 
interior...

Anyone tried it?

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
