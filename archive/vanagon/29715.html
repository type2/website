Subject:       mechanical to electric fuel pump.

I have come to the conclusion that the mechanical fuel pump on my '72 
is bad.  It leaks on to the ground, it leaks into the oil, and it 
looks original.  I checked into the price of a new one and the best i 
got was about $240.  Ouch!  thats almost as much as I paid for the 
bus.  The sales guy then told me that they had an electric conversion 
for $60.  that sounds a lot more reasonable but i am wondering what 
the merrits and trade offs will be if I decide to do this.  Has 
anyone else made the conversion on their carbureted bus?  What do you 
do with the hole for the mechanical? I was thinking about buying a 
new gasket, pulling out the pump rod and replacing the unit as a seal.
thanks.
Ed.
