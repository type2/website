&gt;&gt; I was just on Demented Dworkin's Used Bus Bits web page, and saw a couple 
&gt;&gt; people requesting this part for thier breadloaf.  What is is?  Is it the 
&gt;&gt; spring loaded thing at the rear of the door that pushes the door away 
&gt;&gt; from the body?  And what goes wrong with it?
&gt;
&gt;That's it exactly.  And mine has a broken something-or-other so that the 
&gt;door won't pop into place when trying to close the door.  I've got to do 
&gt;a full body check in order to get it to close and latch.  (Translation 
&gt;for the American non-hockey-playing unwashed: I've got to bump it pretty 
&gt;hard with my body to slam the door sideways into the body of the van hard 
&gt;enough to get it to close.) 

Had to do this on my '75 also.  There is a nylon guide that runs in the outer
track which had popped off it's holder (actually sheared away - no way to fix
without a whole new arm - expensive!). Eventually the nylon rider fell right
out - haven't had to body-slam the cargo door since - it closes with a flick
of the wrist!  Now, sometime in the future the whole thing may give way, so I
picked up a replacement I found at the junkyard.  Just my $2 worth (that's
what it cost me)...
