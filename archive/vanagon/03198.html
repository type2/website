Subject: Old Bus List

Hi to all -

We are the people Joel Walker was
talking about - we don't want to
invade anyone's privacy by asking
questions. Just trying to help people!
Some clubs have been interested in
our bus list. 

My husband and I have a data base of
about 1300 pre-68 bus owners. If you
have a transporter/bus, please e-mail
me or call us at home (201-347-4081). 
You may already be on our list! Most
of the people on the list are SOTO,
NEATO, VVWCA, etc. members, or people
we meet at local (and not-so-local) VW 
shows.

Anthony is one of the local bug/bus
experts. Besides fixing them (as a
mechanic) since his teens, he now
welds too (including roof racks for
buses/bugs). He is always looking for
more info, and he may be able to answer
YOUR questions.

We have about 11 VWs, about 6 buses &amp;
5 bugs. Anthony's daily drivers are a
66 bug and 67 Westy bus. He/we attend
many shows in the northeast, sometimes
camping in the 67 bus. His motto is:
&quot;I did my bit and saved a split&quot;!

We hope to hear from you. Thanks for
the free PR, Joel!

Lori and Anthony Gelato
