Subject: Developing New Web Page - Need Input!

From: &quot;Thom Fitzpatrick&quot; &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;


I was going over some pix of a bus I'm thinking of buying (for partz) and
I couldn't help thinking: This thing is racked!

So I had an idea: I wanna put together the VW Bus Hall of Shame Page. 

Send me pix of the most beat up, chopped, channeled, rusted, beat up,
down and out busses you can find, and I'll put them on the page.

Thom
