Subject: Well, I chickened out

       This weekend I took a shot at trusting the fan switches instead of
using the manual fan switches and about a third of the way up the hill
(after apx. 5min at 95%-100% throttle, third gear, 35mph (low geared diesel
transmission)) the temperature indicator started to go past half way and I
chickened, I turned the fan on to high.

        How high does the needle get before the fan comes on, on it's own?
(yes, I tested the switches, they work).

        I normaly turn the fan on to low once the engine warms up (the
needle moves) and leave it there unless i am approching a big hill, in heavy
stop and go traffic, or any other time that the needle reaches the LED.
Under these conditions I switch it to high (it's loud on high, I can hear it
over the diesel).  Does this sound about normal, am I just being paranoid
(about the van, I'm not talking about the firearms), when do other people
with manual fan switches use them?  any other comments, and does the fan
come on with the lower temperature switches?

        One more, How ofthe should the timing belt on the diesel be replaced
and does anyone know of a place in Southern Oregon that can do it (I am
leaning toward going to VW in Medford for this job, but $300 to replace a
timing belt seems high).
