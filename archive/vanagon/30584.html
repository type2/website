I have had a 93 eurovan MV for about 1.5 years it currently has about =
41000 miles on it. I am very happy with the beast=20
Handling pep (up from the 91 wasserboxer) usefullness of the interrior.

My only gripes are that the realated to the fact that the car is not in =
currently avalible in the US.

Examples of this are the OEM Goodyears are hard to get (I amy rather =
happy with the tires and do not want to ruin something that seemes to =
work) and parts are at times a problem.

An example of parts problems is my EV is currently in the shop having =
the plumbing to the rear heat exchanger replaced.
One of the pipes developed a crack at a hose joint in  the engine =
compartment. The pipes cost $165 a pair and supposably require 8 hours =
to replace. The local dealer has had problems getting the pipes, and =
they determined that the first set was damaged about halfway through the =
installation.=20

&gt;&gt; OK, we love our '93 MV, at c. 25,000 nothing major has failed =

&gt;well  as far as I'm concerned.  Okay my old Chrysler Conquest handled=20
&gt;better, so?

&gt;&gt; Rick's right, the OEM tires aren't great. Ours will probably last =
another
&gt;&gt; 5K-7K, but traction (wet or dry) is not great.

&gt;I love the Goodyears that came on mine.  Suckers don't slip wet dry or=20
&gt;icy.  Don't know about the wear life.  Only some 24000 miles on the EV.

&gt;&gt; Rick under states the EV heating/cooling system: separate

heat in
&gt;&gt; short order.....Surely Duane Moore up there in Alberta has &quot;EV heater =

&gt;&gt; :)

&gt;S\Drove the EV up to the Poconoes this weekend.  Roasty toasty!  No=20
&gt;sliding on the ice and snow either.
