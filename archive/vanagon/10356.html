Subject: [Q] Decreasing gear ratio

I don't remember seeing this discussed anywhere, so does anyone know
if replacement gears are available for my tranny to lower the revs at 
60 mph?  It seems criminal to make that poor engine turn 4000 rpm at 60 
when the torque at 3000 rpm is probably sufficient for the job.  It's 
nice to have the real low first gear for jeep roads in the mountains, 
but in the flats I wind through the gears pretty fast.  The ultimate 
solution would be a five-speed tranny.  Are there any possibilities 
here?  Or were the German engineers pretty smart when they designed the
factory gearing?
