Tom,

My dog is a overenbulged, spoiled greatly loved mut.  She was abandoned
a boy scout camp I worked at a few summers ago.  The camp staff and
campers enjoyed her so much one of us was invited to return this year.
That right my dog went away to scout camp this year.  Spoiled or loved
??  I wish I could have gone but I could not work for free this year. 
Thanks for the trip info.  I was really pushing for the air musuem.  Now
the SO has forced me to change plans.  I am now going to St Louis and
then to the Ozarks National Park.  Do you know anything about those
areas?    

Thanks
Kenneth Winter

&gt; This is a long shot but if you have any interest in military airplanes, the
&gt; mother lode is in Dayton, Ohio at Wright Patterson. There is one of most
&gt; militry planes from the first to latest.
&gt; To take a dog in and out of Canada, you should have a copy of all shots and
&gt; vacinations. Most likely, you will not be asked for them, but have them in
&gt; case.
&gt; What kind of dog? Write me directly.
