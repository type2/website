Subject: Air compressors.

I know we talked about air compressors here a bit back. I listened,
and am ready to go get my first air compressor. I think that
I will need it to get some of the work on the fastback done,
and it would make some of my work on the Bus easier as well.

I want to buy my first compressor. It needs to be portable,
and it needs to be cheaper than $500. 

I want to do painting, impact wrench, sander, some light sandblasting
with it. Mabye some house painting, etc.

I have been looking and it looks like a 5 HP compressor with a 
20 gallon tank should cover it.

I have looked carefully at the Craftsman and the Campbel-Hausfield (sp?)
compressors. The Craftsman compressor hos a slightly higher airflow
rating, (11 SCFM_at_90) is oilless, and direct drive. 
The C-H compressor has a slightly lower rating (9.5 SCFM_at_90PSI)
but boasts a cast iron pump and belt drive.

Some questions that nobody (At the store) seems to be able to 
answer:

Cast Iron:If the pump is not cast iron, what is it, aluminum? Is cast iron
going to last much longer than the alternative? What does it get
me for the higher price.

Direct Drive: Other than compactness, what is the difference between
directr drive and belt drive, other than the belt? Are the belts
quieter or more noisy?

Oilless: My engineering training makes me cast the hairy eyeball on 
something that says 'lubed for life.' Without the oil, I should not
need a seperator if I want to paint, etc. But, a seperator is not
that expensive. Does the oil let the pump last longer, run cooler,
what? Or, does it just make up for the shortcomings of cast iron?

The C-H compressor seems much heavier. I think the tank walls are 
stronger, and the pump is definately heavier. It is also about
15% more expensive, and about 10% less powerful (by the specs).

Is there another widely availible compressor that I should be 
looking for? I only want to spend the money once, for a loooong
time, but I am limited to about $500 including a seperator, drier,
etc. that I need to make it functional.
