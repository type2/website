Re:Problem #1.  I have been wondering the same thing as I have been =
mentally putting together my aux battery setup.

Re:Problem #2: It is a known problem with isolators to have a .6-1V drop =
across the terminals due most likely to internal diodes.  Diodes are =
regularly defined to have a .7V drop.  So it depends on manufacturing =
differences to make up the range .6-1V.

An alternative to this is to use what is called a battery combiner.  =
These do not have a voltage drop and therefore do a better job =
recharging your battery.  The idea is to run your charging circuit to =
one battery.  From this battery run a line to the combiner which then =
goes to the second battery.  The combiner is only closed when it senses =
a charging level voltage, say 13.8V and opens when the voltage lowers =
to, say 12.1V.  Therefore the batteries are combined when charging and =
open when the charge circuit is removed.

This is the modern day equivalent to the relay originally used on =
Vanagons.  Apparantely there are some problems that can occur with =
relays on large amperage circuits.

Not sure I understand about blowing up batteries when they are both =
being charged from a single source.  This is commonly done and in fact =
in the original Westfalia design the batteries are combined through a =
relay when the alternator is putting out a charge.

The boating world has been dealing with this for a long time and one =
boating supplier, West Marine, has an interesting talk about this.  Try:

You will see in the diagrams something us Westy folks don't usually =
have, and that is a battery switch.  You commonly switch your batteries =
off from all loads when leaving the boat.  You also can easily combine =
both battery banks with these switches since they have 4 positions; =
Battery 1, Battery 2, BOTH or OFF.

I have been having one hell of a time with my charging system.  I hooked =
up a
powerful stereo to the Aux Battery under the drivers seat, as well as =
fog
lights and a back-up light.

Problem #1.  I can easily take out the main battery by sliding the =
passenger
seat back and turning it around to face the front.  How do I take out =
the Aux
battery?  When I turn the driver seat to the side there is still not =
enough
room.  The steering wheel prevents turning it towaerd the rear.  It =
looks like
I need to remove the seat to remove the battery.

Problem #2.  When I drive in alot of stop-n-go traffic the Aux battery =
was
running down to nothing.  I checked the battery. It is fine.  I put a
voltmeter on the alternator at idle and it reads 13.8v.  I put it on the =
posts
on the isolator and they read 12.9v! I am losing a volt in the friggin
isolator!  I tried different isolators, same result.  I then by passed =
the
isolator and wired the charge wires to both batteries directly to the
alternator.  This was working fine.  I figured if I stop to camp for a =
while I
would remove the negative post from my main to prevent drainage.  Then =
someone
tells me that I could blow up one of the batteries with this set-up due =
to
different charging needs and possible over charge of one battery.  So =
now I
have the main battery on the Aux post on the isolator ( supposed to be =
switch
on and off with the engine, 4-post isolator) and both the Aux Battery =
and the
alternator hooked together on the alternator post on the isolater.  Now =
my Aux
battery is fine, but my main is slightly under charging in stop and go!


Any suggestions or ideas?  I have read all of the posts on Aux batteries =
and
none has mentioned an under charging problem.  Will the batteries blow =
if I
leave them connected together?

Thanks,
                      - Craig
