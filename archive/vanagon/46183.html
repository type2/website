&gt; my personal experience, over the last 26 years with buses and Continental
&gt; tires is that Conti's suck. if your alignment gets even a tiny bit out,
&gt; the tires take a &quot;set&quot; and will NEVER recover, not matter how many times
&gt; you get the alignment reset. i'm NOT a big fan of Continental tires. :(
&gt; 
&gt; and yeah, $70-80 is about what the other reinforced tires cost. :(

I'd have to second that - although the current Conti CR91 (I think) 
on my '88 seem *ok*, they're nowhere near as tough as the Yokohama I 
have on the front. I've had two Conti's blow up on me on previous 
VW/Audis, both due to broken belts. I've never seen this on any other 
tire. 

For load rating and durability on *very* rough roads, I'm quite 
impressed with the Yoko 378 Load Range D 195/7514 (specify load range 
D, since they also make a 'C')
