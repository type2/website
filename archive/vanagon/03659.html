{this is in response to David's comment, but is an invite to anyone who has
information they'd like to share.}

Most of the stuff on the halfdan vanagon gopher was contributed by Joel 
Walker, and remains either reprinted fact, or his opinion.  I'd be really 
happy to put other opinions on the gopher, and, I suspect Joel would be 
perfectly happy to have some other opinions inserted too.

Let me know if you'd like to contribute.
