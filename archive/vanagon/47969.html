&gt; &gt;Speaking of problems, Gerry Skerbitz is concerned about his fuel pump
&gt; &gt;as it's making a whining noise because of air in the system.  I recommended

&gt; &gt;be in the bay area on Saturday.

&gt; I am having the same problem with my 84 Westy. I did replace the fuel pump
&gt; (ouch, $230!!) and filter, which had no impact on the whining noise. So I
&gt; wouldn't rush right out and buy a fuel pump without doing some further
&gt; investigation.

I bought a Bosch pump in Sacramento and before installing it, I ran it
backwards into the tank to blow any crud away from that filter in there.
[it DID make it home, but I think it's still pumping air]
It seems obvious to me now that there IS crud in there and the only way I'm
going to resolve this is to drop the tank and empty it and REALLY clean it
somehow.  Any hints as to the best way to scrub the inside of the tank would
be greatly appreciated.

&gt; I repeated this process last weekend, and saw hardly any flow out of the tank -
&gt; barely even a trickle. By blowing are into, then sucking back out of the tank 

The odd things was that I had a REALLY good flow out of the tank BEFORE the
pump when I checked at one point.
