The type 4 and the it's Fuel Infection are nothing from which to shy away.  
I feel FI is far easier to diagnose and perform maintenence.

This one however has limited days actually years.  You will probably get 2 
to 3 years out of that engine.  At which point, a replacement will exceed 
your purchase price.  Unless you find one used.  

I think the price is right. 

Good luck

Martin
