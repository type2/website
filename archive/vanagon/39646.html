Subject: Small World - no hiding place!

Went with the family to Stratford yesterday to do the Shakespeare experience
etc...and took the open top double decker bus tour of the towm and sights as
part of it.
Anyway our guides commentary is suddenly interupted by manic horn tooting and
shouting from behind. We are seated at the back up top so turn round and look
down. Behind us, careering thru traffic is a big white truck with some loony
hanging out the passenger window and wiggle waving annd shouting! He removes
his shades and shouts so the entire bus can hear (and half the town) &quot;where's
yer Van Dave?&quot; Yep, its Darren Yip (Supplier extraordinaire of goodies to
Chinese restaurants all over the Midlands).Traffic swerves and all the world
stares at us! How he recognised us sat at the top god knows...and god knows
what all the foreign and American tourists thought about the little
interuption to their commentary.....maybe thats why our kids prefer not to be
seen with us...!
It seems wherever you go intrepid Splitty spotters see you even when in
disguise and without your van!
