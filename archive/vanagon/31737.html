Subject: Lug studs or bolts?

Okay, over the weekend I decided to make an attempt at raising the rear of
my bus (back to level) by adjusting the spring plates.  Well, I never got
past getting the wheels off!  The _at_#$! shop that last worked on the rear
brakes must have put the lug nuts on with an impact wrench.  I was using a
3/4&quot; breaker bar and pipe, but the corners rounded off on two of the nuts
and I had to grind them off.  When I checked the FLAPS and even some VW-type
places, all the books said my bus was &quot;supposed&quot; to have lug BOLTS instead
of lug STUDS (at least on the back).  I took the remnants of my studs into
one VW place and they were able to match them up with studs from their parts
bin, but the owner claimed no bus came equipped with studs - they must have
been fitted by another owner, or the hub was switched or something.  I even
had him check the listing for vanagons, but he said bolts.  I find it hard
to believe that ALL buses had bolts, especially since the only other bus I've
really worked on, a '78, ALSO had studs.  So out of curiosity, what's the
verdict?  Anyone else have lug studs?  Did they come factory?  I doubt I just
happened to come across the only two buses in the country that were so
equipped!  :)
