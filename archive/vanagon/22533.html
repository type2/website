&gt;Do you know how to save a drowning lawyer? - No. - Great!
&gt;Thom Fitzpatrick


Well, it's Friday, so...

Q: What do you call 500 lawyers at the bottom of the sea?

A: A good start.


Q: An ocean liner sank, and all the people jumped overboard and
started swimming. Sharks came, and started eating the people, but
they didn't eat any of the lawyers. Why not?

A: Professional courtesy.
