Subject: Head gasket sealent

The one in question is the 'Bars Leaks' brand.  It comes in two
flavors, both of them quite yucky :-).  Use the one that has the
pellets in it.  It is available in many car parts stores.

 &gt; I know this subject has been hashed over in this forum before But for us
 &gt; latecomers what is the name of the sealent used to seal leakey headgaskets
 &gt; and where can I get some?  Do you have to drop the engine to use it or just
 &gt; put a bead around the outside of the heads?
