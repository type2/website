Subject: RE: Another Tire Q


SM&gt;A fellow at Discount Tire here in San Diego, recommended a Yokohama
SM&gt;reinforced tire in the 185 width, claiming that they see a lot fewer
SM&gt;warranty returns of this tire. If true, that's a good point, but keep
SM&gt;in mind that the suggestion came from a salesman working on commission.
SM&gt;I've never tried those, or any other reinforced tire-- they may be
SM&gt;excellent for all I know. Caveat emptor, y'know?

&gt;The good gentleman is right on all points but I do caution as he says
&gt;salesman on comission.  This Yoko is likely the Y356 available in 6 and
&gt;8 ply rated, a very suitable tire EXCEPT it is a &quot;highway ribbed&quot; design
&gt;more like a genuine delivery truck tire.  It has very few channels IE
&gt;NONE to channel water to the outside, looks like most bias plies did in
&gt;the 70's.
&gt;They wear well, handle well, and are just dandy till you get them in the
&gt;rain when they get &quot;squirrely&quot;.


What's &quot;rain&quot;?
