Subject: Re: radiator fan stays on

&gt;Hi there: After several months out of the country I'm back and, sadly,
&gt;back to Vanagon (87 Syncro) problems. This one looked easy. The radiator
&gt;cooling fan
&gt;comes on when the van is started on warm days, even when the van has
&gt;been sitting all night. I thought it would be the thermal switch.
&gt;Bentley says this is located on the upper left front of the radiator,
&gt;behind the grille. Looking there I cannot find it. The van has
&gt;airconditioning and is a Syncro, which probably complicates the issue.
&gt;Can anyone tell me where it is, or what other possible solutions to this
&gt;
&gt;problem might be? Thanks muchly, Nelson Hogg

I don't have a Bentley but I do know that the switch is located on driver's
side behind lower grille (at least on my 89).
