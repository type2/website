Subject: RE: Eurovan wheels on a Vanagon

Interesting if true.  Mercedes wheels (14, 15, even 16&quot; aftermarket wheels)
are also said to have same bolt pattern, but the lug nuts have a smaller
head and are shrouded in on most MB wheel designs so you have to solve that
and the 2 wheels = studs, 2 wheels = bolts problem.

I always look at the tire/wheel deals ads and dream.  4th gear on the Vanagon
is very close to 4th gear on the 911, so there is definitely room for im-
provement in revs per mile.
