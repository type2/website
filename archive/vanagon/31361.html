Subject: Re: Tires

&gt;1.  Is the high ply tires needed for vans because:
&gt;
&gt;a.) The weight of the van
&gt;b.) Because the handling is so odd and the added ply is required for
stifness
&gt;and intern      better handling.
&gt;c.) None of the above.


&gt;The answer is (b) and (c). And (d), if (d) is:

&gt;d) Most VW vans have huge cargo-carrying capacity-- see the &quot;Gross Weight&quot;
&gt;specification in the oweners manual. If you fill it up with firewood or
&gt;whatever until it reaches this max weight, you will overstress ordinary car
&gt;tires-- that is, load them to a higher weight than that specified on the
&gt;tire sidewall.

Boy I'll say.  This last summer a friend of mine got married and needed 
someone to carry all the alcohol to the reception area.  Of course I was 
volunteered, since the others in the wedding party drive Camaros, Jeeps 
and other low-interior-space vehicles.

We loaded up the bus with 25 cases(that's 24 bottles) of beer and 7 cases 
of wine.  Then, since the springs had not totally bottomed out, we all 
got into the bus for the trip.  Each of us alone is 200+ pounds, and 
there were three of us total.  Now, for those who are unfamiliar with 
Seattle, you can't drive three blocks in this city without going up or 
down a hill.  So, needless to say, it was a VERY slow trip. 

About two weeks later I needed to replace two of the tires, and I'm sure 
my little stunt didn't help too much in that regard.
