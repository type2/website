Subject: Re: Add-on Oil Coolers

Going back to comments about my 2 liter 67 deluxe....mounted a large 
multiplate oil cooler underneath ahead of the tranny, a system one filter 
under the left rear engine compartment pan (same as the battery area but 
opposite side of the compartment), added doghouse tin and cooler, 
and....it NEVER gets hot, plus allows you to keep total stock appearance.

in peace....ethan
   67 deluxe and syncro wannabe
