Subject:      Evap Cooler



Ya know I remember, and man does it make me feel old to even recall this, a
long time ago J.C. Whipme use to care a detachable evap cooler for the car or
van. I can't remember if it attaced to the roof or a window but it was an
evap. c ooler. That was back when they use to offer a double pulley for the
fan belt . It came with a rope that, when the battery was dead, went around
the pully and you started the engine just like a gas lawnmower. Now what do
you think the CR was on those engines?
