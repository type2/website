So Joe Chanin says:
&gt; 
&gt; Well we made it back!!
&gt; 
&gt; our friends.  The Caravan(Excuse the use of the word) consisted of the Bus,
&gt; my friends 80's Jeep Cherokee, and my other friend 80's Pick Up.  Basically
&gt; the bus and two 4X4's---I figured we were going to be in trouble keeping
&gt; up!!  The plan was for 1 night camping--I know kinda wimpy--and 2 nights
&gt; hotel--friends did not want an all roughing it vacation.

How typical of the Utility 4x4 owners.  Oh yeah, my 4x4 is REAL tough and 
macho.  But when it comes to a little camping....  Well, need I say more... ;)

&gt; 110-115 MPH---REAL FAST---about 2&quot; above where my VW emblem would be if I
&gt; had one.  End result--3&quot; diameter dent about 1/2 inch deep---Lets not talk
&gt; about how loud it was or how it scared the crap out of us.

So much for truckers crying about how they have to pay more taxes for the
roads......

&gt; 
&gt; All in all a great trip!!---one other casualty though...found a 1/2 &quot; crack
&gt; in the winshield.

More Details Joe!!!  Come on.  Tell us about the surfing and little things
that happen at the camp.  Not just a short blurb about the drive!  Go ahead,
stick that foot in your mouth.  I have!  ;)
