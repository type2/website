&gt;
&gt;- then, there's MY way. :)
&gt;   i installed a clear foglight on top of the bumper and rigged a relay and
&gt;   switch on the dash. now, this method will light up the world behind you
&gt;like
&gt;   you cannot imagine. :)  like, 500 feet out behind you and way off to the
&gt;   sides. you can actually SEE behind you, and can backup at about 20 mph if
&gt;   you want to. and anybody behind you KNOWS you're gonna do something!!

That's what I did, 'cept I used broad-beamed tractor lights.  They call them
utility lights, come with a rubber housing (no rust!) and a sealed beam lamp,
3-1/2&quot; diameter.  Cost five to ten bucks, depenging where you shop.  Palomar
Tractor (Escondido, CA) wanted 4.95, JCW 9.95.  The one I put on Grendel, I
stole off a garden tractor :-)

You can mebbe see 200 feet but not very well, but you can can fifty feet out
and twenty to either side clear as a bell.

I put four of them on my baja -- makes it easy to set up camp.
