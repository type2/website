Subject: 66 deluxe

i've run across a 21 window, suntop, rusted (badly) body, good runner
it needs a rear bumper and a new canvas top right away....
as i'm new to the world of VW's, i really have nothing to go on except
my instinct which tells me the 3000.00 price is about twice what it's
worth...any and all input on this would be very much appreciated
thank you
