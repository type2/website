Subject: Friday Art


Ok, we've had song lyrics.  We've had Haiku.  We've had insanity.
Fridays have been all in all rather &quot;creative&quot; on this list.
What about a Friday Art Day?  We've had some good ascii pics
in the past, but I'll bet some of you have still more creative
juices yearning to emerge, right?   ;)
