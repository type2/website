Subject: Re: help! with motor I.D.


&gt;          The problem is the motor has NO #'s, anywhere.

Really?  Hmmm...  There's just smooth, numberless metal under the generator
pedestal?  Did someone grind the number off?  How about on top of the right
half case, to the right of the generator pedestal?

&gt;          How do I I.D. this motor, as in Type II or III
&gt;          maybe?  Are there subtle differences anywhere that would
&gt;          give me solid clues?  

Is it a dual oil relief case?  If so, there will be an extra hole for the
extra pressure relief valve located in the bottom of the left half case, at
the flywheel end.  The hole will be covered by a slotted screw-in cap.  All
upright engine cases have at least one pressure relief valve located on the
bottom of the left hand case, at the pulley end.  Dual-relief cases were
introduced in 1970 for both TII and TIII.

Does it have rear cross-member holes?  These were introduced in 1968 for
TII and in 1969 for TIII.

All TIII cases will not have either an oil-dipstick hole, or oil-pressure
sending unit hole.  But these holes can be drilled in a TIII case.

Does it say &quot;Germany,&quot; or &quot;Hecho en Mexico,&quot; or &quot;Brazil&quot; anywhere?

How did your mechanics know that it was a 1600, and not a 1500?
