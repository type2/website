Hi Everyone.  I was following the thread on this yesterday, and 
decided to check my van for these stickers.

I have a '90 Syncro, and the grey factory tag on the license plate 
door says this;

&quot;this vehicle conforms to US EPA regulations applicable to 1990 model 
year new light duty trucks&quot;

So, could one assume that my vecicle could be imported into the 
US (maybe except California)?  

Harry.
