          ...Your comment makes me think of a car that I saw at the grocery 
          store the other day.  It was a banged up and rusted Buick Le 
          Sabre (fwd type) that had a &quot;club&quot; installed on the steering 
          wheel.
     
     Reminds me of a visit to Las Vegas in 1990.  Walking through the 
     parking lot of Circus Circus (on the way to the buffet), I get too 
     close to a &quot;piece of sh*t&quot; late seventies Chrysler car.  I hear the 
     now familiar, &quot;Please step away from the car!&quot; of a Viper car alarm.
     
     BTW, the above description is in no way intended as an editorial 
     comment on Chrysler products (though they think they invented the 
     mini-van - ha!).  Visually, this particular car was a rolling heap.
