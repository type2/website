Subject: The thing list

Does anyone know what's up with the thing list?
I post a (semi-) weekly list on rec.autos.vw that describes how
to subscribe to the various lists, (vintagvw, aircldvw, vanagon,
thing, and ghia) and someone tried to sub to the thing mailserv,
and got a message saying the address didn't exist. I tried to sub
myself, and got the same message. Is it now defunct? Can I delete
this from my list of lists? Is there a new subscription address?
Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor on the bedpost overnight?
TIA,
