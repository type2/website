Subject: PickUp Seat Trouble.

Hi y'all,

I'm a bit lost, i don't know how i can identify the CORRECT seats
for my December '73 1600 Single Cab, modelyear '74. -------

I recall that my Bus had the &quot;twistknob&quot; backrest-adjuster on the
driverseat and grey BasketWeave upholsterymaterial.

Does somebody know if VW made different &quot;twistknob-seats&quot; ?

If so, how can i identify the correct '74 driverseat and 2/3 bench?

ANY input is greatly appriciated !

Brian.
