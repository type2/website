Subject: Converting to electric?
Date: Tue, 27 Jun 1995 14:46:00 -0500 (CDT)

Howdy everyone!  I just got back on the list after a
long absence caused by moving from Virginia to Texas.
The list sure has grown in the meantime.  Anyway, here's
my question...has anyone out there ever done a conversion
of a bus to an electric vehicle?  Or do you know someone
who has?  I've been considering resurrecting one of the 
lonely busses down at the junkyard and converting it to 
an electric, but I wanted to find any information or even
plans (if someone here has done it before) on the best
way to go about it.  I found that they're willing to sell
a decent bus body, clutch and transmission minus the engine
for about $200-300, so I'm seriously considering it.  It'd
be great to be cruisin' down the road in a bus that's 
completely silent and see the puzzled looks on people's 
faces!  ;)  If you have any experience with this sort of
conversion please, please help me out!

PS - Anybody from the Austin area out there?  Any advice
on where to get VW parts and/or VW junkyards in the area?

Thanks.
