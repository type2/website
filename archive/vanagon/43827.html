Subject: How much is my VW worth?

 I am about to sell my 1980 VW Vanagon and I am a little confused on what
 it is worth.
 1980 VW Vanagon 4 cyl air cooled blue
 Body in good shape (no visible rust)
 Interiour is amazing all camp stuff works perfectly (It is the extended
camper)
 Engine rebuilt last summer
 New Brakes (4 months ago)
 New gas tank (1 year ago)
 New starter motor (1 year ago)
 Hasn't been driven in the winter in 3 years
 New battery and tires in the past 2 years
 Has about 175 000 kms
 Overall I have put about $5000 cdn into the van. I would like to try and
 recoup some of it.
 Any opinions on the market value of this van would be greatly appreciated.
 I would like to ask about $4000-$5000 cdn for it.
 Jon
