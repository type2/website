Subject: Availability of butane refills in US?

I currently run the  fridge and stove in my (European) Westy on
butane (2x 6lb 'Camping Gaz' bottles on 30 mbar and 50 mbar
regulators, respectively).

I get the impression that everyone uses propane in the US and that 
propane refills are easy to come by, but how about butane?  Is it as 
easy, more difficult or impossible to get hold of in the US?

Any comments appreciated as we're planning to come over for the '55
South' trip (including  time in the US) and would like to be able to 
eat while we're there!

TIA,

Rich Lumb
