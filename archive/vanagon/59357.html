Subject: VW Shower.  A thought.

Hi Volks,
  I had an idea that I thought I might share with you.  I noticed VW put
in a water sprayer on the Eurovan/Winnabago conversion at the rear of
the van when you open the hatch. I guess you could use it for a shower
of to wash the mud off you boots or water the dog who knows.  I got to
thinking.  Wouldn't this be a neat idea for older buses. However, the
idea of taking a cold shower doesn't sit well with me.  So here's my
idea.  Make the rear hatch area a shower.  Attach a shower curtain
around the rear hatch.  Throw down whatever you wish for a bath mat. 
Get one of those solar shower bags, the ones that holds about 5 gallons
of water, throw it on the top of the van and let it get warm. Put the
bag on the top of the open hatch, a voila, a shower.  What do you
think?  Could come in handy while on those long spans between
facilities.
