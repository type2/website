Subject: Vanagon aircooled - cruising speed engine rpm

        
        Can anyone tell me the engine rpm on the 2 litre aircooled
Vanagon (with factory installed type 091 four speed manual 
transmission with DK code final drive ratios) when in fourth gear  
travelling at a comfortable cruising speed of say 60 mph, and 
with the specified 185R - 14 reinforced tires installed??

        It would be helpful too, if newer Vanagons with a tachometer
could tell me their engine rpm in top gear at 60 mph.   

        Thanks

Gary Meek
