Subject: Transplant Mailing List (?)

     The recent transplant discussions has resulted in a lot of
     interest, including identifying the first victim, ...er subject...,
     and we are going ahead with a hands on, measure the actual metal
     second phase. As Tim S. said: &quot; If we can spread development costs
     over 6-10 people we'd be laughing.  Let MSDS handle the uppercrust
     P-motor jobs, Vanagons_at_Lenti Inc. handle the affordable conversions.&quot;

     The discussion has also resulted in a lot of traffic, some on the
     list, some off. So I'm taking names for a Transplant Mailing List,
     e-mail direct to tforhan_at_hr.house_dot_gov. If it bounces, send it again,
     I calculate 10% of my mail does not arrive first time.

     We'll keep the list informed.  If you want the excruciating detail,
     sign up for the mailing list. Of course, if an overwhelming number
     of listmembers, including Gerry, want to keep the full discussion on
     the vanagon list, we could do that...I will proceed with starting
     separate mailing list unless I hear otherwise.
