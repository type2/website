Cool, Ron -- you're own personal 15 minutes of fame!

Also, what I was going to post.

Any lurkers out there?  Wannabe's?  I decided to check out the busses and
vans I saw driving from Santa Clara to San Jose this morning.  Mostly I
checked out &quot;westies for sale&quot; category, but saw some others.

Hows this: 1985 Westfalia 111k miles looks PERFECT, A/C Auto $4500
           1969 Westfalia interior looks perfect, new engine, body has
                a few dents and rust in the battery tray.

Got phone numbers if you want'em.  I'd have bought the '85 but my wife
HATES automatics.  I saw four other Vanagons for sale, and the single and
doublecab splits I posted about last night.  This was on one drive, not going
out of my way.  I also stopped to look at the new Boxster Porsche.  The
perfect replacement engine for your Syncro Westie in a few years, no doubt!
Cool.  Also gazed at four VR6 EV Winnabago conversions (new).  Did not even
bother to look at the non-westy busses and Vanagons I passed for sale.

In the non-for-sale category, I met the very last Adventurewagon conversion
of a VW -- a 1990 Syncro.  Beautiful high-top camper. and a Syncro to boot.
We were a good crowd of VW's parked there -- two plain Vanagons, a DoubleCab
Vanagon/Transporter (a 1985), the Syncro Adventurewagon and my Syncro Kombi
Transporter.  Did not bother to count the number of busses I passed, although
Vanagons seem to be getting to be the most common ones I see.  Did not see
a single EV on the road.  Odd, 'cause I usually do.  Saw a Baywindow Doublecab,
though, to make up for the lack.

Most of you folks must live in hell.
