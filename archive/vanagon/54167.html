&gt; After loosing my '91 Westy with only 25,000 original miles on it - Mint
&gt; condition - to an engine fire this past Nov 15th, I read your Web Page
&gt; &quot;Vanagon Recall Information. In the following posting:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/recalls.html#1985-1991
&gt; 
&gt; 1985 Vanagon through
&gt; 1991 Vanagon                Built from 1985 Jul  to  1992 Jun
&gt;      Campaign 92V058001     No. Recalled: 340,000
&gt;      Campaign SF            Notification Date:
&gt;      System:                Fuel Lines.
&gt;      Vehicle Description:   Passenger Cars.
&gt;      Description of Defect: The fuel hose attached to the fuel
&gt;                             distribution rail on the engine may shrink
&gt;                             beyond the clamp force of the fuel hose
&gt;                             clamps, allowing fuel to leak.
&gt;      Consequence of Defect: Fuel leakage in the engine compartment can
&gt;                             cause an underhood fire if the fuel comes
&gt;                             in contact with a source of ignition.
&gt;      Corrective Action:     Replace the fuel hose attached to the fuel
&gt;                             rail and install a new spring type self-
&gt;                             tightening clamp.
&gt;                             NOTE: Volkswagen of America estimates the
&gt;                             new self-tightening fuel hose clamps will be
&gt;                             available in May of 1992.
&gt;      Supplement 92V058001   Information has been added to this campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; I called VW America on this. The person I spoke to took down all of the
&gt; information about my loss and said that they would research the matter
&gt; and get back to me.
&gt; 
&gt; When they did, a week or more later, they said &quot;there are no outstanding
&gt; recalls on that model.&quot; I replied that since this had been a 1992
&gt; recall, I could see that it might not be considered &quot;outstanding&quot; but
&gt; would like to have more details on the recall as it was made. They
&gt; denied that there had EVER been ANY recalls on the 1991 Westfalias. I
&gt; asked how it was possible to have a recall posted by the National
&gt; Highway Traffic Safety Administration and VW doesn't have any record of
&gt; it?
&gt; 
&gt; At that time I realized that I had hit a stone wall! I asked to speak to
&gt; someone higher up in the company and was told that there was no one
&gt; higher - all of customer service is at an equal level. Anotherwords,
&gt; &quot;this is the party line and we will not let you speak to any one else -
&gt; we're sorry you lost you van, but that's your problem.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to know where the info on this Web page comes from. I have
&gt; tried to reach the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and
&gt; cannot seem to get a LIVE person. I really want to check this recall out
&gt; - as I am in the process of trying to buy a replacement Westy and REALLY
&gt; do not want to have the same problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I am VERY upset with VW America. I felt like they were really hiding
&gt; something - the wording of their response was very careful and not
&gt; exact. I also found that even though I had mailed in the &quot;change of
&gt; ownership&quot; form in the owners manual in April '95 - immediately after
&gt; buying the Westy, They still had the original owner in their database.
&gt; This, I was told, was because they didn't edit the database unless a the
&gt; owner called in with a problem. Well they have me in there now - but its
&gt; too late as my Westy is gone!
&gt; 
&gt; I am still fighting with the insurance company over the value and would
&gt; like to talk to someone at the National Highway Traffic Safety
&gt; Administration about the &quot;truth&quot; on this recall.
&gt; 
&gt; Thankx-
&gt;
