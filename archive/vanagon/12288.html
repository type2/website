Gilbert,

They do salt the roads in my part of B.C. The last time I was in the
Rockies in the winter I noticed a big difference between the road
conditions in Alberta and B.C. The Alberta roads were better maintained
and more of them had that all weather surface that realy improve tranction
in snow.
Get snow tires, chains, a bag of salt/sand, a shovel, and some mats to put
under the wheels for traction, in addition to a GOOD winter car survival
kit (sleeping bag, candles, food, flares/reflectors etc).

forgive me if I have stated the obvious.

Alistair

P.S. another obvious thing, it gets quite cold, plastic things get
brittle, engines will not turn over, old shocks freeze solid, tires take a
set, ah, I'm getting nostalgic.
