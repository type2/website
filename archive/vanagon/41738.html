Dave,

Sounds like that EV owner must had been so frustrated with rattling heat 
shields that he removed them (I'm getting to that point). :) 

Otherwise, your concern is completely false.  

Maybe he didn't know how to turn the heater off?  :-)

&gt;      Hello Eurovan Drivers:
&gt;      
&gt;      I have been considering trading my 1986 Vanagon GL for a 1993 Eurovan 
&gt;      and while doing some research via the Internet, came across an unhappy 
&gt;      Eurovan owner. Among other things, this individual states that as a 
&gt;      result of the catalytic converter being beneath the passenger 
&gt;      compartment, it heats the interior of the vehicle, which requires 
&gt;      running the air conditioner constantly.
&gt;      
&gt;      Has this been your experience?
&gt;      
&gt;      Thanks for your help,
&gt;
