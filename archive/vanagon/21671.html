Subject: Wanabuser no more!

Well after about a year of looking for a bus I finally got
one!  A '62 walk-through Kombi in excellent shape.  I first
heard about it here on the list--it was the one for sale
near Minneapolis--WWW page http://hemmah_dot_company_dot_com--partially
disassembled but complete.

I'll post more about the bus later--I'm sure I'll have many
many questions as I put the thing back together--just wanted
to share my excitement with you volks. . . . .
