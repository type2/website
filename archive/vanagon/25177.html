Subject: Re: gasoline prices

Gasoline (or rather petrol), here in Sydney ranges from about $0.69 to $0.79 per
litre. I always used high octane in my '87 Caravelle GL, which was anything
between $0.75 to $0.79 per litre.

These prices are Australian dollars so in US terms it's about $US0.52 to
$US0.59 per liter. Which becomes about $US1.95 per US gallon and up for high
octane unleaded.
