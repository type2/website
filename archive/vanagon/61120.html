Subject: Re: Tires: 185 or 205's?

&gt; I may be able to get the Yoko Y370g's, but some people tell me they are
&gt;being discontinued or that the 356's are replacing them. Any clues? I'd like
&gt;to get something I will be able to purchase again in the future, if need be.
&gt;Which do people prefer-the 370's at a C rating or the 356's at a D rating
&gt;which would be a rougher ride, I think?

Raul,

The Yokohama Y370 is being discontinued but in some parts of the country
they are still easy to find.  There are two versions of the Y370, a
passenger version and an LT version.  The LT version is an 8 ply D rated
tire.  This is the one you should be shopping for.
