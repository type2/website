&gt;Where do we get one!

&gt;Can someone post the details on this? 
&gt;Thanks!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: VW credit card
&gt;&gt; &gt; Got a call over the weekend from MBNA and accepted a credit card that
&gt;&gt; builds
&gt;&gt; &gt; toward a $3,500 potential rebate on a VW product. Normally I blow these
&gt;&gt; things
&gt;&gt; &gt; off but since the &quot;new beetle&quot; might be a real car, and Lord knows I
&gt;&gt; charge
&gt;&gt; &gt; enough, and I happen to have a newly teen-aged daughter, I thought that
&gt;&gt; &gt; possibly all these threads might converge a few years hence.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Poor Richard &quot;Wandering Hippie&quot; Palmer turned me on to this VW Visa this
&gt;&gt; past
&gt;&gt; year.  Be sure to get the &quot;standard&quot; and not the &quot;gold&quot; card - the VW
&gt;&gt; graphic on
&gt;&gt; the card is much better!  I don't use it much but do show it off to other VW
&gt;&gt; owners.
&gt;&gt; RMMW has one too.
