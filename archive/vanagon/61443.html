Subject: June Bug Jamboree Feedback

I need some feedback from anyone who attended the June Bug Jamboree in
Springfield, Missouri this past Saturday.

I would like to forward the (positive) comments to the City of Springfield
who allowed us to use city property for the show.  Any negative comments
will be reviewed by GROOVE and hopefully remedied.

I think it turned out well.  Let me know ...
