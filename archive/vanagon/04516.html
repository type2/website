&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, the weakly list shows FOUR Eurvan Campers!
&gt; 
&gt; Would these be MV Weekenders, or are there four Winnebago Campers on the
&gt; net already?
&gt; 
&gt; Or are these European owners, who probably have had Westfalia Eurovans for
&gt; YEARS now?
&gt; 

You're forgetting about our Canadian Neighbors.  They've had campers since
'92 I believe.
