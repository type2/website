I already said that the current was going to change.  Unless the fuel 
gauge is a voltometer or an ammeter, it's measuring the change of 
resistance of the sender.  That resistance isn't going to change, 
regardless of voltage.
 
Maybe someone on the list knows the electical specs of the sender and 
gauge.  But my guess is it measure the resistance of the sender, 0 ohms 
at full, and approaching infinity at empty.

When I got my bus it was 6V, and I converted it to 12V leaving the gauge 
as is.  The gas gauge works as well as any other gauge I've seen.  Full 
is full, half tank is half tank, and empty is empty.
