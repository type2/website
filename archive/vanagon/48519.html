Weeks ago I saw a Vanagon in our town  wearing this MB Alloy rims sold with=
 =
W123. There are nuts and screws available which fits the seats. I used MB =
screws to mount winter tires on my Golf because they a cheaper than VAG =
ones. The seat shape fits, maybe also on Vanagon rims.

&gt;The MBZ wheels have the same bolt pattern.  However, they take a smaller
&gt;bolt and a nut with a different shape of seat.  I'm also not sure that the=

&gt;offset is correct.
