&gt; Here's the problem:
&gt; I begin to drive to work, a one hour highway drive.  About 1/2 hour into =

&gt; yee haa, there's a ton of back and forth play there.  I don't think =
&gt; that's right...  Is it?
&gt; 
&gt; Question:
&gt; Should I try to repack them, as they seem to fall under the &quot;loose&quot; =
&gt; category, or should I replace them entirely?
&gt; 

I just had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM this week.  It also drove me INSANE.  But 
yesterday I had the CV joints repacked and so far I haven't heard it.  If 
they are loose at all I think this is almost certainly your problem (ya 
like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to CV joints).  So before 
you shell out any money buying new anything, definitely repack them.  If it 
doesn't solve your problem it at least can't hurt anything.
