Ok, This is Where I have to make a Comment.
Sesame Street is Good for the yuthful minds of todays society. No Violence,
sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, or the Damned Bevis and Butthead Crap. I will
admit to watching it, and i enjoyed it. It teaches the fundimentals of
reding, writing, and arithmatic (something yur grandparents would say, i kn=
ow).
So, get off yur Cyber-Asses and ADD yur NAME to the LIST.

PLEASE FWD THIS TO ALL YOU KNOW!!!!
Save Sesame Street from being cancelled!!!!!!

This is a petition to save Sesame Street.  ALL YOU DO IS ADD YOUR
NAME TO THE LIST AT THE BOTTOM, then forward it to everyone you know.  The =
only
time you send it to the included address is if you are the 50th, 100th, etc=
..

Send it on to everyone you know.

PBS, NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major
cutbacks in funding.  In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spe=
nding
costs and streamline their services, the government officials believe that
the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion of
funding for something which is seen as &quot;unworthwhile.&quot; Currently, taxes
from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person per year, and the
National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year in total. A January 1995
CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of Americans wish to keep
funding for PBS, third only to national defense and law enforcement as the
most valuable programs for federal funding.

Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations commitees each have 13
subcommitees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies. Each
subcommitee passes its own appropriation bill.  The goal each year is to
have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is October
1.  In the instance of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, the bill
determines the funding for the next three years.

When this issue comes up in 1996, the funding will be determined for
fiscal years 1996-1998.

The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of support
for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making our voiceshear=
d.

Please add your name to this list if you believe in what we stand for.
This list will be forwarded to the President of the United States,
the Vice President of the United States, the House of Representatives and
Congress.

If you happen to be the 50th, 100th, 150th, etc. signer of this petition,
please forward to: bi7975_at_blue.univnorthco_dot_edu. This way we can keep track
of the lists and organize them. Forward this to everyone you know, and help
us to keep these programs alive.

Thank you.
