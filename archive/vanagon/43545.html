Subject: Overheating and MPG?
Date: Mon, 3 Jun 1996 19:17:17 -0700

My wife and I took our 77 Westy (78 engine) on its first camping trip this
weekend. It ran good except for a tendency to run hot and not so great
mileage. On long straight runs the temps were holding between 240-270,
needless to say I was stopping alot to let it cool off. MPG were around
13.5 with 92 and 15 with 87 octane. So I'm wondering if this combined with
the hot running has something to do with the timing, or the advance
mechanism? Around town here (San Francisco) the engine runs fine, around
190-210temps.

Any advice as to the problem? The thermostat is removed, and there's a 2
inch gap in the engine seal near the rear that I plan on fixing, could that
contribute to the problem?  Thanks for any and all advice,  Tom
