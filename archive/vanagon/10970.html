I was poking around in a couple of catalogs last night and found 
something interesting.  I recently heard some talk of Gene Berg and 
his prices.  He has an Engle 110 cam for $58.  This is with no cam 
gear or bolts.  The Bus Stop (aka RMMW) has the same thing for $95.  
Another $26 will get you the cam gear and the bolts.  I think Bergs 
was in the same price range.  So, why is Berg so much cheaper on 
this?  This wasn't his POTL stuff but then again neither was RMMW.  It
would seem to pay to check into this, unless I'm reading the catalog 
wrong.
