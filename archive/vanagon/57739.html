Subject: Dirty gas tank question - '81 Van

Hi all:

 I've been having problems with the van recently that I'm tentatively
 ascribing to a fuel tank with crud in it; however, I'm not 100% sure
 that's the problem.

 I removed the tank once before and found the job to be a PITA.  So,
 before I go through this again I'd like to know:

     1) Anyway to diagnose this as the problem definitively, so I'm
        not just wasting my time, and

     2) Is there any good way to fix this problem without removing the
        tank?
