Subject: '85 steering problems
Date: Wed, 5 Apr 1995 13:46:24 -0500 (CDT)

Hey there.  I have a friend with an '85 that has a problem in the 
steering.  Specifically, when you give it power in corner, like 
pulling away from a stop sign and turning, it will act as if the front
end gives a little then stops.  It does this while turning either 
direction.  The noise comes from the right side.  The steering wheel 
wobbles at highway speeds.  The front end doesn't really move, he 
says, but it makes that noise.  I have not checked this out myself but
will probably be doing some of the work if we are able.  I am guessing
that it might be a wheel bearing or a tie-rod end.  I will check those
first at least.  Anything else I should be looking at while down 
there?  Thanks, Jim

PS  Some financing for the '71 has come along so it's new motor time 
in the next couple of months.  :)
