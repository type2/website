&gt;Bleeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccccccccccccccchhhhhhh!

oh, and i guess Quiche is ok? hell, you can't use Quiche for anything!
at least you can fix the asphalt in your driveway with week-old grits.
you can caulk the windows in your mobile home with day-old grits. at least
they are useful. :)

now, let's all be nice and get back to buses and vanagons and those ...
well, those eurovans (cousins of the microbuses, buses, and vanagons). ;)
