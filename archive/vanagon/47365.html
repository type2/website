Subject: Re: 5- and 6-cylinder VW vans

Well, this is some interesting stuff. It looks problematic for Syncros. 
Here are some of my quick observations:

&gt;4 disc brakes recommended DM 3,600.00

A disk brake kit! That is about $2400 (plus shipping, duty, etc).
I wonder what it really is: ideal would be bigger disks up front, and 
a drum to disk conversion for the rear! 

&gt;I bought the assembling kit from Winkler which costs 2,750 Deutsch
&gt;Marks without shipping.

That is about $1800. Similar to the price for the base MSDS kit.

Some elements in the kit, and comments:

&gt;1 clutch housing (I don*t know, if it is from a Volvo or the VW
&gt;light truck LT 35)

I presume this is a bell housing. Sounds like it it a stock part. 
I wonder if it has any part numbers on it.

&gt;1 complete exhaust system without catalyst (which is not yet
&gt;needed in Germany)

Well, it sure is here!

&gt;What you will need additionally is the 240 mm flywheel itself
&gt;and its pressure plate, both parts of an AUDI Quattro. That will
&gt;cost about 600 Deutsch Marks.

I would try to buy the engine out of a quattro, and these parts would
all probably be thrown into the deal.

&gt;The shipped exhaust system will find its place
&gt;underneath the left midsection. Because my vanagon is a camper
&gt;and on that place you will find a 50 liter water reservoir....

I'd like to know if the vehicle being converted is a
Westfalia camper. Sounds like the place where the propane tank 
is located on US Westies. So they have the exhaust system
running forward?

More exhaust  stuff:
&gt;There have been a lot of plumbing, but it fit into the center of the 
&gt;midsection ...

DOH! Syncro owners, this sounds like the place where your driveshaft and
protective bash rails are. 

&gt;...and the pipe will end on the Vanagons south east corner.

With respects to St. Muir, I would presume Front is North, and he has
the outlet where is is now, at the right rear.

&gt;In Germany we have to weld some parts like the new support for the
&gt;front transmission mount and square holes for the engine support, which 
&gt;altogether allows a 3 cm lowered engine. In this case you have to 
&gt;raise the decklid by only 4 cm. 

Sounds like a complex problem for Syncros. I don't really want to 
lower my engine toward those rocks in the road, there are implications
for the bash rails, etc.. 

&gt;Without lowering, it will be possible to mount everything without
&gt;welding.

But it sounds like you would have to raise the decklid 7cm -
not good for Westfalias, but Helmut does have a camper. The real 
question is how will this affect the sleeping area. Again, perhaps 
his layout is different than ours.

Very helpful information, but maybe not for all of us. I want to learn 
more about the disk brake kit, though!
