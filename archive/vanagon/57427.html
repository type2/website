Whew, I almost scrunched my bus.

Whilst backing out of a parking place at a crowded parking lot 
yesterday, a truck &amp; my bus had a meeting of bumpers.

We both had looked behind to check for vehicles.  Both of us seeing 
nothing, proceeded to back up.  I got to the middle, noticed the 
truck and stopped, leaned on horn, but to no avail.  Waited for 
impact.  After impact, got out to discuss the situation.

Seems that we had met exactly in the center of the drive, exactly 
bumper to bumper, same heights of bumper, parallel to each other.  I 
could see the remnants of his black paint along the length of my 
chrome.  No damage however.  The bumper was already slightly 
skinched from last year, but no additional damage.

Fortunately we met square, had either of us been angled slightly 
differently, a whole 'nother story would have been writ.

Whew ! !
