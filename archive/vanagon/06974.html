&gt; &gt;   I bet people like Cetin, with a Diesel Westie, are even  WORSE than ME
&gt; &gt;   due to the extra weight...
&gt; I hate to admit this, but my cousin's 81 diesel rabbit used to feel like
&gt; a sports car in comparison with the '82 vanagon Westfalia....
&gt; Cetin
&gt; 
&gt; Is this, like, slower than my old '64 1500 camper was?

  By the way, a neighbor down the street says that the engine in his diesel
  rabbit has finally about had it at 335,000 miles. It still runs but is 
  burning 2 quarts of oil with every tank of fuel and he has already gotten
  one letter from the state about the smoke..
  200,000 may be achievable in the Vanagon, despite all my earlier predictions.
  Go for it!

  Also, my wife can't find ANYTHING odd about the interchange you had with your
  SO. Kind of looked at me like I was from outer space (this happens more often
  than you might think). After all, a tank of gas in the timeframe of an art
  historian is something like a nanosecond  to the rest of us..... I'll bet the
  diesel feels fast to her.


  Happy Trails,
