Subject: Re: Census concensus

&gt;geez, i HATE being called &quot;Mr.&quot; :)
&gt;
&gt;don't worry about duplicate lists ... i just keep the info for the stats.
&gt;some folks have expressed a worry/caution/reluctance about such info being
&gt;let out, so i don't put out much on the list other than the state/country
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;anyway, if you want to do it, ok by me. the parts thing would be a good deal
&gt;for lots of folks. somebody on the list has already started a used-parts
&gt;web page, i think, but i can't recall who it was.
&gt;
&gt;but i will warn you: it's a curiosity that will turn into almost an
&gt;obsession!! ;) and it's a pain to keep it up (at least in my case, what with
&gt;folks getting on the list and off and back on again).
&gt;
&gt;and if you do it on your pc, you'll need a good way to get the info uploaded
&gt;to the internet (which i don't have :(  so i have to do it on a mainframe in
&gt;a dippy ibm nick-name &quot;database&quot; program. really kinda sucks.)  good luck!

 I understand. The whole idea is to have a centralized place for parts and
general location of the listees. Only those that are interested and send me
the minimum information will get a list of items and general locations of
other members of this particular list. This way there won't be a waste of
bandwidth and definitely other members will not be bothered.

 I do something like this for the military right now on a much bigger scale.
So, it is not a bother for me and actually, I feel that it is a way for me
to &quot;pay&quot; back for all the questions I ask and the answers I receive.
Basically, my contribution to the list, so to speak.

 I don't feel there is a duplication of efforts. Joel is doing something for
one purpose and I would be doing something else for another purpose. Make
note that this is not a debate. So, if you feel that my efforts are not what
you want/like (in general) then don't send me information. To the people
that do send me the information, as soon as I have enough people and
information, you will get a list in your own mailbox about once a week if
there are enough changes.

 As of right now, less than 24 hours from my first post, there are 14 people
interested. Remember to send ME your messages with a subject of &quot;Census&quot; (no
quotes) and I will add you to my list. I will read all the messages and
catalog them accordingly; parts for sale, buying or even vehicles for sale,
not to forget, add you to the list.

 Don't send your messages to the list, instead send them to raulb_at_iglou_dot_com
and I'll take care of them.
