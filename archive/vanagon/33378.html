I have almost had my bus torched a few times.  I think (and maybe some of
you have figured this out too) that the fuel connection on the carburetors,
which is pressed in, tends to work loose with vibration over time (I had
several do this).  Sucker comes out while you're on the freeway, and hoses
the hot engine with gas before you can stop

------

i had this happen shortly after visiting Crater Lake in Oregon.   Bus just
died, and went i took a look, the metal bit had fallen out of the carb, so i
wired it in and we were on our merry way.

It didnt catch on fire that time though   8)

it had before - i forget why -  oh yes,  the #%$#carb was giving problems and
it spat gas out of it which somehow ignited.  ,  melted the power wire to the
coil, and presto!!, bus stalls.  I pulled over, saw smoke, opened the engine
lid, and my quick witted dad (we were on our way to go out to dinner)
 smothered the flames, and the bus was saved!  (a bit blackened in the engine
compartent, though.)  some new wiring to coil, carb, taillights, etc, and new
fuel line  and it was happy again.  Oh, and i remembered to keep the air
filter on after that.


the saddest thing about Gus was that i killed the tranny.  It had been
sitting in the desert for three years before i bought it, and the trans boots
had completely rotted.  I drove it for about 300 miles and i started to get
tranny whines.  I  consulted my gurus, who told me to check the trans oil.
 It was, of course, dry, and the boots bad.  The guy had driven it 200 miles
back from the desert before i got it, so the 500 miles did permanent damage.
 i got 13,000 miles out of the trans, then the noises got awful.   I called
around to find prices on rebuilding split case trans - 750- more than i paid
for the bus.   Just in the nick of time, i saw on ad in the local paper for a
58 w/
