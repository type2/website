Subject: Exhaust Parts -- Aftermarket sources?

I've been coaxing my '81 brick's exhaust for about 10K miles now, but this
weekend a 1inch -square section of the crossover pipe blew out...the sides
of the pipe are just too corroded to hold in the gases! :-(    Anyway, I
called the dealer and found that they want $188 for the crossover pipe assembly
... not sure how much things like the cat. converter will run.  My question
is -- are there any recommended aftermarket sources for VW exhaust systems?
I'd appreciate any leads.

Thanks in advance,
Andy
'81 Vanagon
