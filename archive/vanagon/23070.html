	Well, tonight I installed a cool addition to the bus!

	I had an extra dome light, so I installed it in the engine compartment,
on the top rear part of the hinge carrier.  There is an angled surface there,
and its the exact proper width for the light!

	It lights up the engine compartment pretty good, and whats
kinda neat is ya can't actually the the light itself unless you
stick your head in the engine compartment!

	I also put a new seal on the apron.  The &quot;default&quot; length of seal
isn't enough to do this last piece.

	I also bought a new accelerator cable today.  I got the cable
kind, not the wire kind.  It came with 2 different types of ends, one
on each end.  You cut off the one you don't want, and cut it to length, and
they have a fitting you put on the end.  I'm not sure how well this fitting
is going to work, so we'll see.  Its a tube-like thing that you run the cable
into and has an allen set-screw.  Anyone used one of these before? Its
amde by bugpack.
	
	In other news, I finshed de-rusting my new bumper, hammered on it
some more, bent it worse, straightened it again, painted it with some
spray paint (for the time being, so it doesn't rust again) and installed
it again.
	
	I also wire-brushed the muffler and re-painted it again with heat
resistant paint.  Had I mentioned that I did that the other day?  Anyway,
a couple of spots had bubbled up.  I think I didn't let it dry long enuf
or didn't clean it up well enuf before painting.

	Well, thats all for now.  See ya guys tomorrow!
