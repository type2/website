So Joel Walker says:
&gt; well, yeah, but us silliers have to remember to leave some room for the
&gt; techies and fixers and straight-up type folks.  i'm not a techie, but i

What?!  Joel, are being a modest old fart or what.  Just because you get
your information from ALOT of research, does not mean you are not a 
techie.  

I've gotten more help from you than most of the techno blabber in 
any other group (not meaning to knock those folks. It's cause I just
happen to own a Vanagon).  And I don't particularly care how the 
knowledge was acquired.  It's still useful and I know I'm not the
only one who feels this way.  Compared to you, Ric and others, I'm 
definately on the low end of the VW knowledge base but I feel good that
I can help someone out on or off of the list with there minor problems
that may not seem very hard to deal with in this group or the vintage
group (although most of the time I don't say much because questions
usually get answered to death before I can say boo! ).  

So don't gimmie this I'm not a techie shit!  ;P
