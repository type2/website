&gt; Speaking of who borrowed ideas from where, there's a little aircraft
&gt; museum at Teterboro Airport here in north Jersey, including a Korean war
&gt; helicopter like you've seen ferrying the wounded on M*A*S*H.  The engine
&gt; is a flat six, placed vertically, and looks a LOT like a Corvair engine.

Hmmm, vertically mounted, huh??  Kind of makes you wonder about the
design of the oil pump, etc.  Lubrication is a little trickier when
gravity's not on your side.  Kind of interesting.

VW content:

Last night the rear dome light in my '78 shorted out and blew the fuse.
I'm not sure exactly what's wrong with it but the switch is VERY loose
and I broke it taking it out (it was cracked already) so I need a new
one anyway.  Weird.
