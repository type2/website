Subject: Questions on Splittie stuff

I have debated on and off on restoring my '62 Walk Through. I decided to proceed today. So, on with the fun! I have retrofitted the full width folding bed from a '70 Westy to fit in the back (looks great and works even better!) Instead of messing with the pop out windows, I was planning on putting in solid windows (with rubber seals) ala 50's busses. For ventilation, I would like to put in an aftermarket folding fabric sunroof. Has anyone had any experiences (good or bad) with the aftermarket sunroofs? Has anyone replaced the pop-outs with fixed windows? My reason for replacing the popouts is that I cannot stand the rattling and rust! They seem to sprout new rust every time I turn around! Also, I am looking for the correct front doors for this rig (drivers and passenger sides, rust / big dent free). Or, even better, does anyone know of someone with a Westy pop-up (the small one) that would be correct for this year bus? I would appreciate recommendations and assistance. Thanks! Chris
