	Motor's probably just fine, sounds like the big nylon gear
is basicly shot. My Rabbit's wipers failed like that. You need a
rebuilt/new part. (Usually can't buy just the gear...) Junkyard part
might be recently replaced or might be minutes from failing like
yours has. Try FLAPS or a discount parts source- DB&amp;HVW list some,
maybe Dennis knows, or (gulp) the dealer. Rebuilt from somewhere
with a new gear will make all the difference in the world.
