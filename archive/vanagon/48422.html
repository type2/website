Subject: Spark Plug Covers

-- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] --

Hello All,

The spark plugs on my recently-acquired '84 Westy are covered by brass-
colored fittings. Are these pull-off items or screw-offs?

The learning curve will be long, but it has been shortened by you most
generous folks.

Thanks.
