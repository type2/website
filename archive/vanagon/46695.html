Subject: Re: Swap 1600 to a '73?

Bob,

I understood the value of these parts earlier. I've considered helping
a V_at_L listmember that wanted to perform this swap before, but i didn't
because of the bulkiness, to put it like that, of the parts. My intentions
were to send a set over to this particular person.

I will do my best to illustrate the dimensions of these parts later, but i'll
try to describe them now.

The rear engine support is made of approx. 1x1&quot; square, thick wall tubing and
uses the very same holes in the rear frame members as the T IV support, and of
course, it's bolted to the engine at the usual T II and III bolt locations for
the rear support in the case.

The tinware around the engine (shroud, cylinder tins, pulley tin etc, but not
the F&amp;R breasttins) is identical to the common/earlier upright tinware, except
that the cylinder shrouds have three welded nuts on their outer left and right
edges instead of two at their corners only, but they are not neccessary for a
proper installation. VW made a new front (FWIF) breastin with doghouse outlet,
nothing spectacular about it, it is very simmilar to the earlier T II tins and
the T IV tins. VW made the reartin from stock T I tins to on which they
spotwelded the extra metal to fill the remaining gap. The added part is mainly
flat with two 'special' area's: the edge that goes up to join the part of
the body where the chassis number is punched and the curve that goes down
to join
the rear crossmember seal-lip. It is supported by a small bracket that's bolted
to the muffler, it bolts to the muffler in the same manner as the tailpipe
bracket on the other side. This piece is often missing and i often fabricated
it from approx. 15x200x2mm sheetmetal strips

I'm building a 1776 for my '73 right now. I will be using a lot of Berg parts,
i knew the company but i only got a hold of their catalog recently.
One thing that really bothers me is the rusty tinware, i'm planning on ordering
that all new from Berg, he carries original VW Do Brasil parts, (btw, it's not
all speed parts they carry, check it out, you'll be surprised, (&lt;- maybe not you
Bob :) )) I want to have everthing galvanised and powdercoated, so if i'm a
little carefull with assembly and future disassembly this set will last the
rest of my life. I want to have the upright/big engine compartment breasttins
new as well, because the most of these rear tins, (if you can find them at all)
are rusted through. I had a '77 and two '78 Mexican Busses that had 1600's,
so i think it will not be impossible to find them there. But i wanted to ask
Berg, they state in their catalog that you can provide them the VW part number
of a part that the dealer doesn't supply anymore, and they will find out if the
part can be ordered from Brasil or wherever. So i want to provide them the
numbers etc.

I will check out the '68&gt;'79 T II partsbook i have at home and see if there
is a nice drawing in there, i can have it scanned and/or copied here in the
office. I've seen them on microfiche as well.

To be continued.

Brian
