Subject: Re: Help on 1776 overheating?

&gt;I recently swapped my 1776cc from my '67 bus to my '57 bus.  This 
&gt;last weekend, I took a trip to Moab (Utah), about 4 hours away for a 
&gt;little biking get-away.
&gt;
&gt;I &gt;&gt;NEVER&lt;&lt; had any problems with this engine before.  It is a 
&gt;1776cc, with enlarged oil passages, and the largest stock oil cooler 
&gt;available.
&gt;
&gt;Couple of clues.  When the engine was changed, the only differences 
&gt;are that a different (smaller) fuel pump was installed, and a 6v 
&gt;starter was put on.
&gt;
&gt;Clue #2.  It will become very hot even on a trip just 10 miles away.
&gt;
&gt;What are the common practices to find the trouble with the engine 
&gt;overheating?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any insight!

Mike,

Your clues are key, I believe.  I think you have a fuel problem.  Especially
since the engine was fine before.  I've had this happen on engines when I
used the little silver &quot;pressure regulator&quot; which I'm pretty sure just
restricts fuel.  Berg clued me into this a little too late.  I could melt
heat exchangers with this set-up, even though the car drove incredibly well,
I could do 85 mph in a '63 bus, this was also a 1776 engine.  I just hung,
like, two huge oil coolers on it and drove at 280 degrees.  Needless to say
the engine didn't last long.

Anyway, put a fuel pressure gauge on that pump, it should be at least three
psi.  Is the pushrod too short or too long?  Maybe get a new one with a new
filter and check the lines from the tank that they aren't kinked or
restrictive in any way.  VW's like fuel, lots of it, whenever it wants.

Eug,
