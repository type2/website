Can I offer a suggestion regarding the application of certain terms to VW
Transporters?  In particular, the terms thrasher and POS:

I have a 60 Singlecab that's kind of beat up.  Not *too* bad, mind you, but
the left side ahead of the rear axle has a silly patch made from a
riveted-on sheet of metal with bondo around the edges that covers a nasty
dent where it was broad-sided and flipped on its side.  I had to cut and
weld in a new top section above the passenger door with my smoke wrench
(oxy-acetylene torch, since I don't have a &quot;spark wrench&quot;, which would be
better for sheet metal) to keep the rain out.  Still need to do the side
repair one of these days...

Anyway, that's my personal definition of a thrasher.  A POS is a
fundamentally different animal, requiring either sloppy workmanship, or a
basic focus on quantity, rather than quality, in the vehicle's manufacture.
A *brand-spankin' new*, say, Datsun (Damn!  I mean Nissan!  Keep
forgetting! [but then, I still call it Boulder Dam]) can be a POS, on the
other hand.  At least the VW started out life as a decent, solid, well
thought-out attempt to get the owner and a bunch of folks/cargo from A to
B.  They're friendly and charming, too.

This isn't out of any library-sanctioned dictionary, just my mondo-bizzaro
mental meanderings.  Feel free to tell me to jump off, if you wish!  8^)
