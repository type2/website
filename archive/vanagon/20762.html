Subject:       Re: '71 bus camshaft question


&gt; Question:  When disassembling my crankcase, I compleatly scrambled
&gt; the cam lifters (followers?). Didn't read not to in the Idiot's guide.
&gt; The mechanic that I took things to for general inspection and boring
&gt; caught this and said that they should stay matched, and gave a very
&gt; reasonable explanation why (won't go into it for time's sake).
&gt; 
&gt; Is this true, or am I getting the _shaft_?  Ouch! sorry about that:)
oops.  didn't do the numerical cutouts in a cereal box trick, eh?  
the undisclosed but 'reasonable' explanation is not a joke or hoax.

&gt; 
&gt; Do I get new camshaft and lifters?  The shiny part of the camshaft has
&gt; some dark streaky areas, but _looks_ OK otherwise to a rookie's eye.
how long do you want to keep your engine?  seriously.  it will 
certainly run fine (or as fine as before) but the unmatched profiles 
*will* accelerate wear.  if you're anal-retentive like *some* people 
on this list you will think about it continually.  envisioning 
reduced cam lobe to lifter surface areas in your sleep and you can 
just FEEL those microfilings of metal between your teeth.  you have 
to balance the cost to your piece of mind...  

do this:  take the camshaft to a machinist and ask them to assess it. 
 if it is marginal, do the replacement.
