cheeses_at_arn_dot_net.hi.i'm.new.to.your.group.just.got.back.from.a.3.week.trip.to.the
&gt;
&gt;sequoia's and the redwood. my '71 made up to 7500' on a one lane road 
&gt;with 690 curves-ranger told me later.
&gt;
&gt;when i got back had to replace the generator which meant pulling the 
&gt;engine (my first time). since i did that replace clutch and exhaust. 
&gt;everything is okay now.
&gt;
&gt; so what's this about a baja trip? sounds interesting. i've been down 
&gt;there a few times, san quentin, san felipe, san miguel, etc. i fake a 
&gt;little gringo espanol and seem to get by okay. i have always found it 
&gt;best to stock up on food since markets are sometimes scarce and out of 
&gt;food.
&gt;
&gt;where do you guys and gals want to go? south of san felipe might be 
&gt;interesting, or even bahia de los angles, since it might not be so hot 
&gt;now.
&gt;
&gt;open to ideas
&gt;
