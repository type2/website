Jim&lt; while I am not that familiar with the wasserboxer setup, a common
source of a cold interior is a faulty, plugged heater core matrix. If you
can be reasonably sure that the coolant is reaching operating temperature
(check with a thermostat -perhaps) and you are still not getting enough
interior heat, perhaps the core itself is at fault. What we do up here is
cover the grille area (cardboard etc) but I have no idea what effect this
would have with the engine at the back; another choice would be to go
with a thermostat that opens at  say 87 or 85 instead of the usual 80 C. --
