I used the gasoline additive and got slightly better results 
(mileage/performance) than previously with Red Line FI Cleaner..

Surfing around the Web for Vanagon info, I found a suggestion for BG
Synchroshift when replacing the transaxle fluid. No one in Oregon has
heard of BG products. Has anyone used this stuff and is it worth
searching for?

Thanks,

Steve
