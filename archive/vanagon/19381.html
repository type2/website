Subject:       Crazy Winnebago/Eurovan Motorhome.

Well, I was flipping through the channels last eveing, and as the 
station hit TNN (ACK) I saw the coolest ad for a motorhome.  

It looks like Winnebago has created a really slick motorhome with the 
Eurovan's front end on it.

Has anyone seen or heard about this unit.  If it runs the stock EV 
engine it has got to be &gt;&gt;WAY&lt;&lt; underpowered!

Pretty cool though!
