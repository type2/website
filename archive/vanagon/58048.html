Subject: 86 Vanagon FS N, Cal

I have a 86 Vanagon FS.  

  It needs a Steering rack,  Front Brakes, Shocks, Windsheild and a High beam light.

  The rear tires are good, but the fronts are thin.

  The Vans been sitting for about 6 Months.  The rear seat folds tio a bed, and the 
middle seat folds forward too!

  I want to sell this van right away, I want $2500.00 for it.  DMV fees are paid too.

  E-mail me for more details or info.
