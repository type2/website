Subject: RE: Freon Conversions / Substitutes

&gt;Well how did it work out.....

The FR-12 (frigc) conversion seems to work great in both cars so far. It seems 
to cool as well as R12, and the compressor cycling and load don't seem to be 
affected. There's also no overheating in the Westy even in city jams. (Last 
summer it would overheat even without A/C - replaced the clogged radiator this 
year.)

The cost of FR-12 here is 1/4 that of R12, so after fixing leaks (which needed 
to be done anyway) both cars were converted for about the cost of servicing 
one with R12.

Cost of conversion fittings CAN be under $10 in cases where the straight 
fittings will work. But to fit behind the Westy closet I had to use a 90 
degree fitting - so count on $20 for Vanagons.

Of course our temperatures here are only running about 95F so far this year - 
the true test of capacity will be 10 - 15 degrees hotter.
