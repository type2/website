Subject: Generator access or engine access on Pre 72 buses???

 I remember seeing a 71 bus one time that had the top of the engine
compartment or the bottom of the luggage comaprtment (whichever way you view
it) removable so that one could access the carb/air cleaner/generator from
above. this involves cutting the sheet metal out and making a pretty rigid
cover that replaces the hole.

Has anyone else seen this and is it worth while doing????  It would let you
remove the fan cover &amp; generator without removing the engine or are all we VW
mechs meant to be able to remove the engine in 20 mins.
