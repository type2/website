Subject: Re: listserv move

&gt;I will be doing some major changes to the machine that runs the listserv 
&gt;very soon.  Some implications of the changes will be:
&gt;  1. Very likely the ftp and gopher sites will be down for a day.
&gt;  2. I will keep the listserv running through it all.
&gt;
&gt;I'm shooting for thursday and will confirm when it's final.

Thanks Gerry,

I know most of our lives will just stop cold, but, maybe we'll all go for a
drive that day.

Eug,
