Subject: repost of previous post (65' Van in Toronto)

No i haven't decided to sell my Westfalia.

update- talked to this guy at 4:30 on April 11. The van is still for sale,
except now he told me that he has to sell the van by the end of April
because he is moving to New Zealand! So maybe he'll be a bit more
reasonable with the price he is asking. IMHO $1800.00 is too much to ask
for the van, for the kind of condition it is in. I think $1,000 is more
appropriate, give him a call and chat. It would be nice to see this van go
to a vangon.lenti person.

here's the repost. Promise i won't post this again.

Saw this ad in the Toronto Star yesterday on April 6/95 .

1965 VW Van (camper) Orig, pop up roof, 5,000km rebuilt new tires, must
see. (416) 530-1063 $1800 obo.

I went and saw the van after work yesterday. It was originally a B.C
vehicle Velvet green and white (not VW white i don't think). Van is
aftermarket camper conversion of what was originally a non-walk thru panel
van. Body is in &quot;good&quot; condition. There is rust (holes) underneath the
cargo doors and on the rocker panel on drivers side. Holes are just
beginning to form behind front wheels. Usual rust under windshield. The van
could use a good cleanup overall. It has potential, but would definitely
require some work. Of course it's owner thinks the rust is &quot;trivial&quot; and
can be fixed no problem. The van isn't so far gone as to be considered a
major resto, but would definitely require some work.

oh yeah, there has been this huge louvered window cut into the drivers
section behind the front door, must be about 4' long! I think the van was
converted by a company called adventure campers from elkheart indiana.
p.s.that rebuilt engine doesn't look to great IMHO.

give him a call if you're interested his name is Robert.
