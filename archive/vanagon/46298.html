Subject: Re: Firearms and Inuvik?

In 1987, I carried a 30 06 rifle when driving through Canada (on the way to
Alaska in my '73 Thing) with no problems.  I just declared the rifle at
customs and they put a seal on the case.  They told me I was not to open the
case while in Canada.  We had no bear trouble, so I didn't open it and all
was well.

Hope this helps,
Bo

&gt;Let's suppose &quot;someone&quot; wanted to pack while on the Alaskan Hwy. Let's also
&gt;suppose that it's illegal to carry firearms into Canada. How does &quot;someone&quot;
&gt;get the weapons (protectors of the ass) into Alaska? What are the applicable
&gt;laws? What permits are required?
&gt;I personally have as many weapons as I have skateboards...
