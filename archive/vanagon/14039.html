Jack, are you talking about the drain plugs/caps on the underside of the van?

If you are, then matching the thread size won't be (I'm guessing) to hard.
I picked up a &quot;corrugated&quot; a plastic tube that directs the sink dirty
water to whatever receptacle under the van. It screwed right on to the
van, much to my surprise. I have seen similar tubes at RV centres, so
maybe a cap could be found...
