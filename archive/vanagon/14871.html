Hello all,

Well this whole engine switch thing is turning more sour every time I 
go look at the bus.

Changed the oil, and put in a new voltage stabilizer (?) on Saturday. 
Drove 20 miles.  No aparent problems.

Parked Sunday.

Go out Monday morning.  Monster puddle of fresh oil has leaked out.  

Cuss a lot.

Get under the bus.  Oil is not dripping from oil plug or coverplate.  
Oil is not leaking from valve cover.

Oil is dripping from tube from block to head.  (Valve lifter 
tube?) I can't determine exactly where it is leaking from though.

How much will this sunuvagun end up costing me to get fixed?  I trust 
it is major work. 

Can you hand me the phillips, I just got SCREWED!!!
