&gt;| where did you read that the coolant sender should be disconnected?  I 
&gt;| disconnect the idle stablizer, but I have never heard that anything 
&gt;| else should be disconnected.

	In the Bentley. Though I just realized my timing instructions were
for the digifant engine. Looking at the Bentley for the digijet, you are
correct - the idle stablizer should be disconnected AND the two plugs
should be connected together. That is all the connections that are specified
in the Bentley (28.33).
	It also says that your idle speed should be adjusted before timing
the ignition, and should be between 800 and 900 rpm.
