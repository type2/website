&gt; &gt;&gt; Any advice on mounting the spare on the nose? Should I paint
&gt; &gt;&gt; the insides of the drilled holes with Rustoleum?

&gt; &gt;I certainly would. That'd be a good place to start rusting. You wouldn't 
&gt; &gt;notice it for awhile, hopefully. You shouldn't have to use your spare. I 
&gt; &gt;might even squirt some silicone rubber stuff on the screws you use to 
&gt; &gt;attach the mounting bracket. 
&gt; Dammit, Jim, what's this fixation with silicone you have??  It's comments
&gt; like this that lead to the eventual downfall of civilization...  oops...
&gt; Never Mind.  :-)

Thanks Pat... I knew I could count on support from a member of my own VW 
club! I'll remember you at re-election time!
