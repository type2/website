Subject: re: MOFOCO report

I just got off the phone with MOFOCO and they were quite pleasant.=
  They
had recieved the parts I sent back and are sending out replacements
forthwith.  In addition, they are sending out new intake valves and=
 new
valve springs--The fellow I talked to had no explanation for the=
 used head
parts--but did say that   all of the parts should have be new.  Hopefully
the replacements will be first=A0rate=20
