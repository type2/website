&gt; By models I mean the little 1:25ish scale models in plastic that

&gt; If anyone has a brand name/stock number etc. please forward the info

For the convert, 'Skip's Drive-in' by Revell is about the closest you'll 
find. You can still get this at Hobby Shops &amp; K-Mart etc.

For the Van, Try Dennis Chung's Think Small Models.  I can send you the 
address tomorrow if you'd like, but I think it was posted a while back.
