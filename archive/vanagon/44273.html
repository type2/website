Subject: 73 Westy tent for sale

I've got a genuine VW tent for sale. It came with the Westy I bought as a
second owner. The original owner tells me he used it twice. Looks to be in
very good condition. Has poles, of course.

I had a fellow offer me $250, and he spent the money before I could meet up
with him. I'd like at least that much, and I've heard good ones can bring
twice this much. 

Accepting reasonable offers.

Email here.
