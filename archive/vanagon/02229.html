Well, it's clear you and Joel are not in the same league &lt;grin&gt;
Dill Pickle would be alphabetized under Pickle, Dill so as to be
properly categorized.  On the other hand, he probably has expanded
the VW Parts numbering system to apply to the frig, so none of it is
really alphabetized, it's just put in bins with the part numbers on them.
