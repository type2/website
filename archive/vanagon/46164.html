Subject: A 72? kombi, i may obtain..


 yesterday...no...day before, me and a friend whent to look at a &quot;bus&quot; 
that we were told was free.. we were also told not to touch the 
ambulance. unfortunatly, it was a Caddy amulance instead...the ol' 
ghostbuster machine..

anyhow, i think the bus was a 72, since it had the T4 motor, one piece 
tailights, and no access hatch from above...
btw, it was sitting behind a funeral home. with '83 plates on it. and. 
and. LITCHEN &lt;sp?&gt; growing on it!! 

oil was old, but smelt ok, and still slick. 4 flat tires, physically, in 
much better shape than my 75, the engine had the duals on it, and a 
header exhaust. 

later the owner said that the enigne &quot;was replaced with the bigger one&quot;. 
sorry, no numbers yet, but should see again today or so.  owner says it 
was parked because, &quot;the engine would run, but it didnt seem to go anywhere.&quot;

hmm...sound like a symptom on a slipping clutch. either maladjusted, or 
maybe the front oil seal leaking a li'l to much..&lt;both porblems i am 
quite familier with&gt; i am currently kicking myself for not looking under 
the enigne for leaks, and oilsign. oh well.

it shifted a little tough, but noit bad. real ol oil. gas pedal stuck, 
till i pulled it back up. all glas is there, and good except for crack on 
right side of front window..:(  

owner then said that we should &quot;make an offer&quot;, but we are not, were not, 
and prolly will not be in such a possition to make an offer, since we got 
no money. and 3 broke cars. and no damn job, or house...but thats a 
dfferent story alltogethor.

second on the list of &quot;if we can come up with 700 or maybe 600$ for both&quot; 
is, i regret to say, a american car. a 1973.._dot_can i say this here? of 
course, we have all had dreams of such, who hasnt, but i'd prefer a 60's 
model, Cadillac HEARSE. he wants more than the offered 500 from another 
guy, and will toss the bus in free. slight surfac rust, rollers and all. 

suposadly has a &quot;real big engine..like a 500 or something&quot; &lt;my more 
american knowledgeable friend looked at it and said 
it was probably a 4sumthin &lt;475?&gt; with larger cut 
heads... or sum such. i wanna drive the hearse, but i WANT the bus.

if it does run, i will try to drag my battery and a can of gas out there 
before p/u and see if it really does run.i hope so, cause i need an 
engine..:)

of course, we still hope to get it for free, or REAL cheap...of course, 
i'm seriously considering selling of my pro audio equipment &lt;that i swore 
i would never get rid of&gt; and get a decent bus...oh well...i just need a 
damn car! and hoiuse and more...but still...
