Subject: rebuilt VEGE 1600sp

     &gt;update on '66 kombi/_dot_camper with rebuilt GEX 1600sp. the 300 mile 
     &gt;checkup went well.  oil was clean clean.
     &gt;changed it anyway.  cleaned screen and deep sump.  traces of lithium 
     &gt;type stuff, which i assume was used in the rebuild. #'s 1 &amp; 2 valves 
     &gt;were spot on, 3 &amp; 4 were a little tight. the farthest forward bottom 
     &gt;case bolt was weeping and when i went to tighten it the bolt started 
     &gt;pulling out of the case. 
     
     etc..
     
     Talk of rebuilt motors has prompted me to talk about mine and what I 
     think of it.
     
     It's a 1600 sp rebuit by VEGE of Holland and came as just a longblock.
     It has brandnew VW heads and just about everything else. Original 
     parts are the case and crankshaft. Having had a 'rebuilt' engine 
     before I was impressed at the quality of the case which looked new, no 
     corrosion on the sump fins etc.
     
     I ran the engine not exceeding 40mph for the recommended 500 miles, 
     with no problems. No oil leaks off the case joint or the sump plate.
     
     At 500 miles I changed the oil which was pretty black for 30W grade 
     but clear of bits and things. I checked the valves and had to adjust 
     only one or two gaps.
     
     I found that the sump plate started to leak after I'd disturbed it for 
     the first oil change. It doesn't drip, it just gets wet with a little 
     oil - I guess it's seeping past the sump nuts.
     
     I ran the bus for a further 2500 miles taking it up to normal running 
     speeds, 55 mph and found everything to be ok with no apparent 
     overheating of anything. At 3500 miles I changed the oil again for 30W 
     and the valve timing was fine.
     
     As summer got REAL hot (in the 80's) I found that I would get a slight 
     knock just after start up for about 5 seconds. I wasn't happy about 
     this but I figured it was down to the oil grade. The temperature 
     dropped recently and the knock dissapeared. So I figure next summer I 
     will put 40W in.
     
     It's now on 6400 miles and approaching the 7500 oil change ready for 
     winter - so I will put 30W in for winter.
     
     Lee.
