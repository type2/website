&gt;FS: '82 was-a-diesel Vanagon (&quot;The Beast&quot;) with a 5 liter Ford
&gt;V8 engine and Pantera transmission.  60K miles on the engine,
&gt;30K (?) in this van. $4900 (just listed in the Auto Trader - was
&gt;previously $5900 parked on the street.)  Contact the owner, Tim
&gt;Silva, in Santa Cruz at 408-479-1886 (no email.)


Wow.

If I didn't have my hands full with the V6anagon...
And if I had $5K that wasn't doing anything...

Seriously, the V6anagon is plenty for me. But what a trip that thing
must be!
