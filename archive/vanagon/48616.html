Subject: Type2_at_primenet_dot_com bashing

I have met both Ken &amp; Richard and they are *BOTH* fine people.  If Ken's 
motive for taking over the air-cooled part of the list was &quot;profiteering&quot; then 
he is a *BAD* businessman.  The last time I checked, PrimeNet was not 
providing their services free of charge.  The truth of the matter is *SOMEONE* 
has to pay for the runing of the lists, and that someone is not you or I.  The 
University of Minnesota allows Gerry to run the V_at_L list.  Ken has to pay for 
running the Type2 list.

Ken asked Richard not to use the Type2_at_primenet_dot_com as he already had 
plans for merchandise to help defray some of his losses in running the list.  
Gerry has had to flex some administrative muscle in the past as well.  They 
both have a right to do this.  *WE* do not own the lists, they do.  It's
their party 
and I am glad that we were invited to come along, but as long as we are here, 
we have to play by their rules.

A couple of months ago, Gerry announced that we were drawing too much 
attention on campus and things had to slow down.  Ken offered to help, no one 
else did.  If it were not for him, we might not have either list.  I say we
thank 
them both for providing a forum for us to participate in.

&gt;Gee, weren't we lucky that Gerry didn't have any 'plans' for vanagon_at_lenti!

Tim, whether you like it or not, there are people out there who profit from
VW's.  
They do serve a purpose.  If not for them, many others would not be able to 
play the game.  If you don't need their services, nobody says you have to use 
them.

&gt;I am deeply saddened by Richard Palmer's post about the t-shirts and 
&gt;stickers and how he has to refrain from using the &quot;type2&quot; list name because 
&gt;the list administrator has &quot;plans&quot; for it.
&gt;
&gt;Prior to the split, we were one big, if not to some, combersome mostly happy 
&gt;family. It seemed to me that the list name belonged to all of us, and the 
&gt;job of the list administrator was just that...one of administration...not 
&gt;one of ownership.
&gt;
&gt;Since when did anyone grant ownership of the &quot;type2_at_primenet_dot_com&quot; name? I 
&gt;didn't realize that &quot;type2_at_primenet_dot_com&quot; was a piece of intellectual 
&gt;property that could be &quot;owned&quot; by an individual. Gee...I guess I'll have to 
&gt;go looking in my copies of Computer Law Journal to see where that one got by 
&gt;me.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry for the rant...but RIchard Palmer did yeoman service (much I 
&gt;understand out of his own pocket and generosity) on providing us with shirts 
&gt;and stickers....now it seet making venture.

Ric, are you paying the PrimeNet bill?  Does *Richard* have a right to &quot;Type2_at_
primenet_dot_com&quot;?  Just what is your argument?  Let's respect Ken's wishes.

&gt;Ron Lussier (no smartass comment)  :)
&gt;I have to admit also that the greed of the new list admin bothers me. I am
&gt;glad it's not the case here on the water-cooled list.

Ron, greed has nothing to do with it.  All the guy wants to do is recoup
some of 
his losses.

Now let's talk about buses instead of t-shirts!  :)
