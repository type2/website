     I also did the best job I could flushing out the water/oil emulsion 
     from the cooling system--what a mess! Then I drained the radiator and 
     engine, and refilled just the engine with a 50/50 mix of antifreeze 
     and water.
________________________________________________________________
I seem to recall a fairly extensive procedure being required for diesel 
engines that get coolant into the oil.  something to do with the ethylene 
glycol/oil/diesel combination as being particularly hard on the 
bearings....hard enough to wipe 'em, if I recall.  Diesel bearings are under 
some serious loads; 22:1 compression ratio, don'cha'kno....

The procedure included adding some sort of solvent like thing to the 
crankcase, running the engine for a short period, draining and refilling the 
oil, and then restarting; if the starter &quot;dragged&quot;, then the procedure must 
be repeated.  Is your starter having any trouble turning the engine over?

This may have been more for an over-the-road engine, YMMV; you might want to 
check this out with a more diesel/coolant familiar mechanic.  On the other 
hand, I could be totally wrong.....it has been a while, and things have 
changed.....
