&gt;The &quot;no-starter&quot; situation may have just initiated itself on my '83 diesel

glow
&gt;plugs to power down).  At the time, I was more concerned about the glow
&gt;plugs,
&gt;since a second spin of the key produced starter motor motion.

&gt;The discussions over the last week about this problem sound like the wiring
&gt;circuit is getting some high resistance connections.  Has anyone tried
&gt;tofilrst identilfy and trace the starter circuit, and then go through the
&gt;circuit connection by connnection and open each one, clean and reconnect to
&gt;see if this solves the problem?

Actually, I don't think we have the same problems.  Yours is probably caused
by the glow plug relay, or the same as a problem (small one) I had some time
ago.

There is a wire which runs from the glow plug relay to a temp switch in a
collant line located just below the oil pressure switch (the front of the
head).  If this connection is loose, broken, whatever, the glow plugs will
stay on as long as the ignition is on.
