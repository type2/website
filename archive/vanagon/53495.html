&gt; &gt;&gt;electronics, exhaust, FI, etc., but the problem I am having is sorting out
&gt; &gt;&gt;the extra vacuum lines. These are the larger ones on the air-cleaner side
&gt; &gt;&gt;of the motor. On is even has a Y-shaped fitting on it.

&gt; there may be one or two &quot;Y&quot; vacuum lines.  each is hooked to a vacuum
&gt; solenoid for boosting idle speed during A/C use and when there is an engine
&gt; load from the PS pump.  if you're current set up doesn't have either A/C or
&gt; PS, then you don't need them and they should be blanked off.  they 'work' by

Thanks for the definitive anser.  The A/C is not working and I my 84 does
not have power steering, sooo....  I'll plug'm Danno!  8-)
