&gt; &gt; How long do you think one of the EV engines will last for before having it
&gt; &gt; replaced/rebuilt?  How much for a rebuild nowadays?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks, Chris

I am not sure about service in the EV, but that engine is essentially an
Audi 5000 5 cylinder, and in the Audi the engine is usually good for 200
000 mi.  I have both a Tubo diesel and gas Audi 5000, and their engines
are great (knock on wood) after 150 000 mi.
