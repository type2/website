Subject: Re: Have you replaced the Receiver/Drier in your A/C?

Possible theory: Old reciever/drier released  drier material into system
where it collected down stream in expansion valve causing partial
blockage. The seepage is the new recievers way of responding to the
increased pressure.
Good Luck

&gt;My mechanic is doing work on the A/C system of the 86 Syncro. He has
&gt;detected a very small leak in the system at the blowoff plug of the
&gt;receiver drier.
&gt;
&gt;Typically, the blowoff plug does not just seep, but rather it opens
&gt;and all the freon leaks very quickly. On a catastropphic failure like
&gt;this, the system will not hold any pressure. That is not what
&gt;happened. The system will hold some pressure but it leaks out over 24
&gt;hours.
&gt;
&gt;FYI, this receiver drier was replaced in June this summer.
&gt;
&gt;He has some theories on the cause of the problem here, but to verify
&gt;his ideas, we need some feedback from owners of 86 and up
&gt;Vanagons. What we want to find out is the turnover rate of receiver
&gt;driers due to the blowoff plug failing.
&gt;
&gt;So, if you have had your receiver drier replaced and it was replaced
&gt;because the blowoff plug failed, let me know. I must stress that a
&gt;receiver drier is sometimes replaced because the desicant is &quot;full&quot;
&gt;of moisture. If this is the case, you don't need to let me know about
&gt;your receiver drier replacement.
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, if anyone has replaced the expansion valve of the A/C
&gt;system, please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.
