&gt;&gt;Splitties have great points, and I'd never cut them down in all 
seriousness.
&gt;&gt;Personally, I like driver's and passengers' windows that roll down, and
&gt;&gt;rear wheels that stay vertical regardless of load. I DON'T like having to
&gt;&gt;have a special (busmount) engine case, and not being able to mount many
&gt;&gt;of the aftermarket oil coolers/filters because the engine hanger gets in
&gt;&gt;the way.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And in a picky moment I say:
&gt;        Seems to me we're talkin' different genres here. Pre-'68 busses
&gt;don't require rearmounts, and the special case. It's only '68-71 that work
&gt;that way.


Sorry if I made it confusing... it was 68-71 flavors I was referring to.
And I was calling out both good and bad points of them... check out
my .sig to see my preference!
