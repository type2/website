Subject: No mail on my vanagon list

I have been unable to read my mail on the list for several weeks now. Usually
when I look at it, it is full and I try reading all I have time to do. I
understand it has been so full that I couldn't receive mail. But tonight
there was only four on the screen and they were commercial. What happened?
Could anyone out there give me the e-mail address to reach the correct
Vanagon official to learn what to do now? Aol has been so busy I could not
get through, but now they have installed 2,000 modems here in Orlando and It
is a little better. Thanks, Bob in Orlando.
