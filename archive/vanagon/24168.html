Subject: Re: Road sign interpretations


&gt;My favourite recent signage is one that we spotted on the way to Sequoia
&gt;National Park, near Visalia. The sign is huge and has the words &quot;Left Wing
&gt;Liberals&quot; with the red circle and slash through it. Perhaps right wing
&gt;liberals and middle of the road liberals are still ok?


Well, no. But we're patient... one thing at a time.   :)
