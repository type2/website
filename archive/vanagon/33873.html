Subject: Dust Caps


To All:

They pry off.  And drive on, using a piece of exhaust pipe tubing.  No dents.
 You'll need a specially bent tool, like a brake adjusting tool or a
beekeeper's hive tool (one of the must useful scrapers ever made).  Whatever
tool you use, use the cast bosses on the brake drum as fulcrums.  The cap
will pop right off, even when heavily rusted.

If you hammer on your dust caps you'll distort them, they'll no longer be
round.  They'll still 'fit' in that they won't fall out, but they will leak,
water in one direction when fording streams, grease in the other when the hub
heats up.

The same piece of exhaust pipe that serves to drive-on your dust caps will
seat the front wheel seals on an early bus.  It's wise to replace the seals
with each brake job.  They cost about two bucks each.  Keep the driver with
your brake tools, since that's about the only time you'll need it.

-Bob
