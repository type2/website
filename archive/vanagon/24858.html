Subject: Re: Feedback - VW Website

[quoting deleted]

The facts are:

1. It is not now and never has been our intention to close any website or, 
specifically, the website at the University of Manitoba.
2. We are neither suing or censoring anyone in this matter.
3. It is our desire to protect our trademark and to ensure that it is properly 
and tastefully used. This was not the case in this instance and we were 
attempting to correct this matter.
4. Volkswagen does not charge people to view information on its website.
5. We look forward to working with anyone interested in developing their own 
Volkswagen Internet application, provided that our trademark is used correctly.

The site in question presented the VW logo not only without permission but in a 
way which was patently offensive -- as a cover to the private parts of a nude 
woman.  At best this is in extremely poor taste; at worst it is offensive to 
our current and future female customers.  

Thank you for your interest in the situation.
