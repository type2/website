Subject: Vanagon muffler advice...

Hello everyone, 

It looks like I'll need to replace just the muffler on my 
'87 Vanagon Westfalia.  It has a small rust hole.  I've used muffler 
repair goop to seal it up and extend it's life a bit more on several 
occassions.  But the sealant only lasts so long, and then I need to 
repair it again. I'm thinking of springing for a new muffler.  I've seen 
'em offered by the Parts Place in MI, and a few advertizers in Hot 
VW's for a little over $100.  Ron Salmon, do you sell these?  Has 
anyone out there recently purchased one, what did it cost, where 
did you buy it, how much to ship it, where is it made and is it of good 
quality.  I'd sure appreciate some &quot;experienced&quot; feedback so I can 
get a decent muffler at a reasonable price. Some other items that I 
need and would like your opinions on are: a set of Bosch sparkplug 
wires, a new O2 sensor and your reccommendations on Bosch 
sparkplugs (stock or ?) for this '87 Westfalia Automatic Vanagon. 

You can reply to me directly or if you want to share your tips with 
everyone, then to the list.  Thanks for your help!
