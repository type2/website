Subject: re 95 EV Camper &amp; Winnebago


&gt;Well I hope that they are able to fix the problem this time. I would like to
&gt;take it out camping but not when you can't trust what your guages say.
&gt;Otherwise I love the plushmobile and all of the critical systems are working.
&gt;

Oh come on, you're going to let those gauges stop you from using it? ;-)
(Actually I didn't even know there was a gauge on the tank itself, I'll
have to get down there and look again!)

BTW: how long did the propane last while driving the furnace anyway? Manual
suggests something like 36 hours continuous usage.

&gt;Has anyone else had to have Winnebago called in to service their Camper?

No. Local dealer (Carter VW in Seattle) claimed that their mechanic(s) took
the Winnebago training and they can fully service the entire vehicle. They
supposedly did this just because of the kind of problem you're reporting.
I haven't really had any trouble with anything (other than the initial low
battery but that's because it sat in the showroom for a few months) in the
W side.
