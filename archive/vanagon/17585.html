Eugene, did you travel on rough roads the day before the breakdown?

Do you think that some old crap/rust/schmumf from the bottom of the gas
tank got shaken up and clogged the fuel filter?
(don't know how that jibes with good spray pattern though, but can you do
a flow test to check the pump?)

I am with old J. Walker in firmly believing in good, bordering on
excessive filtration ;)

Keep up the great posts.

Alistair
