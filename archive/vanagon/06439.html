&gt; 
&gt; Thirdly, I replaced my air flow sensor because I was being 
&gt; hypochondriacal about the engine performance.  Stupid move.  Don't 
&gt; replace your air flow meter unless your van is cutting out at 
&gt; specific rpm ranges and then runs smooth at others.  I've become 
&gt; something of an air flow meter expert thru my trials and can discuss 
&gt; these in another post if desired.
&gt; 

Please post.  My engine cuts out and stumbles under load in the 
1000-2000 rpm range. No idle problems.  Doing the resistance test
on the pot in the airflow box gives wild readings (as I move the
flap, resistance goes up and down, not smoothly up like Bentley
wants).

BUT,  my van runs like a charm with no hesitation at all under any
circumstances if I leave the O2 sensor disconnected.  I doubt that
the airflowmeter is left out of the loop when the computer doesn't
sense the airflow meter...  which is why asked earlier about good 
FI books, so I could find out what is being ignored and attack those
guys.

I fear to bring this to the dealer, because I looked at the previous
owner's records...  he had the 60000mi major service done for $600+.
9000 miles later, he complains about rough running, etc.  They replaced
all the plugs, wires, etc _again_!  This was only a $280 visit.  There
was also evidence of a particularly sleazy VW dealer; they charged him
$58 for the air filter!  Ouch.  At the 60000 mile service, it was only
$32, and at the same dealer as well.  Looking through the old service
records makes me fear dealers mightily.
