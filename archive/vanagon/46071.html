Subject: FS, 93 EVan MV, Lancaster, Pa.

Seen in &quot;Cars by Dealers&quot; for 19 July 96:

93 EV MV. White, 18k miles, automatic, a/c, p/s, p/b, p/windows. Picture
shows it with top raised. &quot;The largest room in the industry plus the safety
of ABS brakes, all with the utility of a weekender package.&quot; to quote the
ad.  No price listed but that's true for all of the cars in this dealer's
ad.

I looked it over on the lot (there was no price sticker on it) but it was
too dark to tell much about it.

Contact the dealer not me. I happened to see it while traveling on vacation.

Autohaus VW-Audi, Rt 72 (Manheim Pike) at Route 30, Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, 299-2801
