Subject: importing Westfalia van conversions from Canada to US?

I understand the Westfalia camper vans are no longer available in the
US (though I don't know why) -- evidently Winnebago is doing the
camper conversions in the US now.  These appear to be inferior,
however, and Westfalia is still available in Canada.  Does anyone have
experience bringing a camper from Canada into the US?  I would have
thought the various free trade agreements would have made this simple
by now, but I hear contradictory stories.  I'd appreciate personal 
experiences or references.

Please refer me to an FAQ if one exists; I looked but didn't find any
reference in the VW FAQ.

Thanks,
-- danq
