&gt; My wife and I just decided to add to our VW &quot;collection&quot;.  We are looking

&gt; have broken slider door handles (the outside one).  Can anybody tell me why?
&gt; I'm sure we're not imagining this, I'm talking about over 50% here.  How

No, Alex you're not imagining things I've noticed the same thing on Vanagons.
In fact the slider handle on my '80 twisted off in my hand about a year ago.
It has something to do with the turning/pulling stresses on the base of 
this casting. 
Since then I have not been able to find a used handle at wrecking yards 
in my area and although I haven't checked out a new price, from past 
experience on other parts, I'm pretty sure I don't want to pay it.
Does anyone else on the list know dealer $$$ on this part? Or better yet 
have a good used one they'd part with? 
*Just checked with dealer **94.25** for new handle I knew I didn't want t
o pay it. Now I'm really interested in a used one. Anyone?
