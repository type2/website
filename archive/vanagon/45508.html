&gt;Best Movie script done under influence of really weird drugs&quot;
&gt;&quot;Most impressive display of Bull&quot;

Last night, I caught a couple minutes of the movie about the Chicano
Calculius teacher in LA (Edward James Almos) who teaches the homies to
think. (No put-down intended from Math impaired VanBondo). 
eg: $3000.00 total cost plus 6 months = Resto. HONK!!! wrong answer.
See I told y'all...
Caught the scene where &quot;Hee-moe&quot; the teacher walks out of the school bldg
all bummed and stuff because his students have been accused of cheatin' on
the big test. So &quot;Hee-moe&quot; walks into the parking lot to find that his VW
Beetle had been stolen. Dejected, he controls his anger like the
proud/strong mental man that he is and simply walks home-too proud to catch
an offered ride from his fellow teacher. Next thing you know, in the same
afternoon, his students (including Lou Diamond Phillips) are out side of his
house posing like gangsters inwhite Tshirts over white athletic shirts and
Sahara Beige balloon pants shouting, &quot;Hey- Hee-moe, ese, looook at wot
happened to your car, man! Professor Hee-moe looks out side to see a fresh
paint job with involved multicolored striped graphics and Empi eight spoke
wheels. Simple as it is. Just like that! Because that's the way it goes in
the Barrio. Happens every day...
I about puked thinking that this Hee-moe dude gets his cars stolen, painted,
dried and lowered to a cool stance during the lenght of time that it takes
him to walk home. Cry-eye!!! (Aye,yi,yi) I wait years for any paint! I
couldn't get the Bodyman from Hell to get my bus done for a zillion months
if I blew $100. bills up his *** with a ten foot Zulu dartgun!!!! Now I know
what the Body Shop from Hell was doing with it's time and MY money!! They
were working on Hee-moe's bugs! (Hoser) It's a conspiracy I tell ya!...
No, wait that was just a movie...
Ah, like, Nevermind.;-)
