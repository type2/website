Attention All MicroBus Fans!!! Attention All MicroBus Fans!!

U-Pull-It on Mack Road here in Scare-amento has a '67 standard ripe
fer pickin'!  It has a compleat seat of popout windows, guages, switches
n stuff.

I took the wiper assembly and the turn signal relay, 'cause I know 
someone who was looking fer 'em.  I also got a bus oil-bath air cleaner-
hard to find!  '67 has a lot of 1-year-only stuff, so get picking while
its still there!  I ran out of $$$ so I couldn't get more stuff :(
Next weekend, if the gas tank is still in it, its mine.  It would be
sweet to have the extra 5 Gallon capacity!

I also scored a set of 4, count 'em 4 BMW alloy wheels for my SO's 530i.
for three of them I paid $10 each, and when I went back to get the last
one, they charged me $8.  Go figure.  My SO is a very, very, very happy
camper right now - even got the off the hook for Valentine's Day!  I broke
a 17mm socket and 2 Craftsman ratchets getting the last wheel off, though!
