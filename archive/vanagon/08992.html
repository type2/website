So, on Thu, 29 Dec 1994, Steve Wall sez:

&gt;     Seminars - I'm capable (I think) but not experienced (I know) of 
&gt; 	working on Cassie, so I'd be interested in having someone
&gt; 	show me some of the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 		Oil change (don't laugh...)
&gt; 		CV joint inspection/repair
&gt; 		Brake inspection/repair
&gt; 		Coolant replacement/refill
&gt; 		Belt checks
&gt; 		Oxy Sensor inspection/repair
&gt; 		Plugs, etc.
&gt; 		???
&gt; 
&gt; 	I don't need to have these things done during the trip,
&gt; 	but some kind of group walk through (complete with unique
&gt; 	lore derived from experience) might benefit all (experienced
&gt; 	and less experienced) - kind of give a hands on version
&gt; 	of reading the Bentley book.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Maybe one of the more experienced participants could bring
&gt; 	a few tools, etc. needed.

&gt; I'd be willing to come up with a (loose) schedule for these seminars if
&gt; people are interested - I'd need to know who is capable of teaching
&gt; what and how long each seminar might take - I don't think we'd want to
&gt; spend more than 3-4 hours of the weekend total on these seminars.

I like the idea of a few hours going over bus mechanics, and I'd be 
interested.  Basic stuff I'm ok with (but a review never hurts, right?), 
but I could use a primer and point-at-the-little-boxes session on fuel 
injection.  Our camper is the first FI car I've owned and, frankly, all 
the sensors, wires, the black box, etc kinda freaks me out.  Also, I 
suspect I've got a pesky vacuum leak that's been irritating me for a 
while I'd like some ideas on pinning down.  I'll bet a lot us of have 
little things like this, and we could all learn quite a bit by poking, 
pointing, and sharing problems and fix-its.


Thom: is that going to be a _split window_ bus cake?
