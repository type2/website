Is that where the skid rail can contact the exhaust if it's bent up?
I bent my skid frame again on a bad road and I think that the low
rumble that I hear now isn't a cracked exhaust, but the skid rail
contacting either the engine frame or an exhaust pipe; this has
happened before, has it happened to anyone else?  Except for the
muffler, I haven't had to replace any exhaust parts yet.
