Jason,

As far as the manual goes, the tranny and its front mount are different 
than a 61's, as are the wiring connectors and of course the 36 hp motor.

I'm not sure about the brakes.  The master cylinder is common with the 67 
&amp; earlier models.  I'd cross reference a good supplier--Vintage Parts, 
Wolfsburg West, or Rocky Mtn Motorworks to see what part numbers are the 
same for the various years on the wheel cylinders, shoes &amp; drums.  Good Luck!
