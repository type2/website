Subject: '54 RHD Deluxe Update

Between last night and tonight, I cut the lower portion of the old frame
rail, where it enters the wheel well.  I had to go about 3/4 of the ay up to
get around all of the rusted out areas and into solid metal.  I then fabbed
the plate which forms the wall of the contraband compartment and boxes the
frame rail.  My wire wheel for the die grinder was disintegrating, so I
couldn't clean the area and weld it in yet.

Next I will create the U shaped channel to tie the two pieces of the fram
together.

Any barndoor people on the list have the measurement from the bottom of the
&quot;seat shelf&quot; to the top of the frame rail, or a between a similarly relevant
set of points?  I wanted to double check the &quot;lattitude&quot; of this new
section.  It is different, barndoor to non-barndoor, I already tried that by
looking at the '56.  This is important because it will affect how the floor
and outer skin line up.  I took measurements from the rib to the bottom of
the rocker, and used a bottle jack to lift the cargo floor and frame rail
into what I believe is the proper position.

I got lucky/good on lining up the frame rail crossways: using a straightedge
across the existing and new frame rail sections, it appears to be aligned
perfectly, or at least to tolerances which I can not see or measure. :)

The other lucky stroke is where my gusset ends on the rear section of the
frame rail, where its welded: it ends up being perfectly in the middle of
the outrigger!

Another barndoor question:  how many outriggers does a barndoor bus have?
The simple fact that I have to ask this question should suggest how bad this
frame really was... 

I have been taking pictures as I go along.  When I get this next set
developed, I'll have some scanned and put them on my web page...
