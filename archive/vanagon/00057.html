These problems with the '85 engine surge on idle remind me of the problem
whereby the fix is to install the factory auxiliary wirinig harness between
the air flow box and the regular wiring. Most dealers do not know of this
fix. This is, like, a $20 part or something. Try this next. E-mail me if you
must for the part number.
