I have forwarded a message from Tom Quan who had one of the valve seat
inserts work lose on his GEX engine. As there are several owners of GEX
engines on the list (including myself) and many more with non-GEX factory
rebuilt engines in their vanagons and busses, it would be useful to hear
from any who has a problem with valve seat inserts or know of the problem.

There are several questions: a) what is the exact problem with valve seat
inserts; b) what is the most likely cause and c) what efforts can be taken
to prevent the problem?

Thanks in advance for any leads, information or advice.

&gt; David,
&gt; 
&gt; Mine was also a GEX rebuilt engine; one of the cylinder heads went at 25K.  
&gt; My friend's '78 bus also has a GEX and the  head went bad  at 50k miles.  
&gt; 
&gt; So far, you are the first to contact me, but I'll share whatever I have.   I
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,  Tom
