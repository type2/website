Subject: Aux. fuel tanks for Splitties

To All:

I've been spending a lot of time laying under Grendel, looking at her ceiling
through the holes rusted in her floor.  (A hole you can step through is a BIG
hole.  Good Condition.  Remarkably little rust.)

Down in Baja you're never more than a hundred miles or so from a gas station
and given the fuel economy of a bus or bug the only precaution you need to
take is to carry a couple of jerry cans for those times when the Pemex
station is out of gas.  But the trip to Inuvik includes a couple of gas-less
stretches long enough to require you to carry additional fuel.  And if I run
the engine in order to power a shortwave transmitter I'll be even farther
behind the 8-ball.  

An early VW bus doesn't offer a lot of places to mount a jerry can.  I can
lash a couple to the roof rack but an auxiliary fuel tank would be a better
way to haul additional fuel.  Unfortunately, I've never seen an auxiliary
fuel tank on a bus that I would care to ride in.

Laying under Grendel,  I realized the space outboard of the longitudinal
frame members is fairly well protected.  The space is about 4.5 inches deep
at the frame member and about 14.5 inches to the inner panel of the sill,
which forms another longitudinal frame member about 2 inches deep.  Overall
length of the unobstructed space is a little less than four feet.  If you
crank the hypotenuse of that triangle at about ten inches from the
longitudinal frame member you have a space that could hold about 12 gallons
of fuel.

The purpose of this posting is to ask if anyone knows of this space being
used for auxiliary fuel tanks, and to invite comments on auxiliary fuel tanks
in general.
