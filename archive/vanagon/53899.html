Subject: Re: Security code on radio

Dino,

Your radio should have a serial number on it. You can call a VW dealer with that
number and they can find the code from their computer.  That is in case you lost
the code. I did this a few times with stereos that I got with no code.  However
if you put the wrong code in too many times your stereo may lock up for good and
I never heard of freezing as a method to fix that.
