Subject: Another EastCoast GNATT Suggestion...


While thumbing thru the latest issue of the LiMBO Transporter, I
noticed that the Ben &amp; Jerry's VW Bus Show is once again scheduled
for June 11 this year. Last year's show was well attended by
both Typ2 folks and Typ1 folks.

The show is in Waterbury VT, just off of I91, and is held on the
grounds of Ben &amp; Jerry's, there is camping nearby.

Perhaps this could serve as a location for an EastCoast/Canada
gathering?

Ric
