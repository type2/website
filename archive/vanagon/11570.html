Subject: How strange ?

So they said...


So martha rubin says:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Have you received any e-mail from him?  Was it at all &quot;different?&quot;
&gt; /m
&gt;
And the Pentium Master replies:

I have only corresponded a little with him.  He asked if I was going
to Red Rock and thought I might like to caravan with him down a
while back.  At the time, I said I'd not be going.  And he replied
that he understood (I think he did. It's been a while).  Since he
doesn't post alot, I'd assume he's not as in to the Vanagon thing
as much as the rest of us are.  I haven't noticed any strange
writings.  Hmmmmm.  Of course, now you tell me after I just asked
him if he was still interested in caravaning down. :(   ;)

Oh well, We'll see what happens.

Cheers!

and from mine own little gnarldyup fingers I type....

So what means this &quot;different&quot; and &quot;strange&quot; ?  I guess I gotta get some
flannel or a younger brick to avoid the labels.  Oh well...  I read the
digest and post when it seems appropriate.  Insofar as being chatty on the 
list, I don't often have the time here at Lew's Rosevile Computer Stomping 
Plant.  Ruby and I (Ruby's a Burgundy '89 syncro westie) will probably be
going to Red Rocks the weekend of the 24th and more than likely going to 
Saline Valley /DVNP this weekend for the first of the desert flowers and the
DV-III meeting of the Airheads (BMW Motorcycle Touring folk).  Actually with
103K on Ruby I kinda think I am into the Vanagoing thing.  We've travelled 
the Southwest, the Northwest and the Rockies.  The last adventure went (in
black and white silent digest form) Auburn...Winnemucca...Boise...Silver Creek
... Idaho Park/Henry's Fork...Vail (World MTB Championships)...Durango...Moab
(4days on White Rim Trail)...Chama (Toltec RR)...Taos...Navajo Dam (San Juan 
River) ... Moab ... Austin NV (Spencer Hot Springs)... Monitor Pass (Aspens)
Markleeville (Dinner at Villa Gigli), trophy section of E. Carson River ...
Auburn and back to work to earn some more frawgskins to finance the next 
grand tour.  So with drivin', lookin', pitcher snappin', fishin', beer huntin'
mountain bikin', poppy watchin', green chili eatin' , sourdough bakin',
bird watchin', powder mowin', an' power nappin' there ain't much time fer that 
chatty stuff on the net.  

Now returning to your regularly scheduled programming, from a fur lined rut
on the information byway by virtue of an HP 735...

Oh yeah, any takers for that paper copy of the syncro fiche ?
