&gt; 	What is the capacity of the '67 tank?  I was told the capacity on
&gt; the '56 tank was 11.1 gallons; a friend told me he thinks the capacity on the
&gt; '67 was 15 Gallons or so.  Anyone have a reliable source of info for this?
&gt; (ie owners manual)
&gt; 
A while back, I was looking to put a late model tank in my '67, and from
what i understand, all microbus tanks are 10.5 gallons, and late models
are 15. The consensus also was that a late model tank would fit into a
micro with no modifications. Although I have not tried it yet, perhaps
you might want to look into it...
