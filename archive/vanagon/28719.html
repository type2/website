&gt; &gt;&gt;I have a friend - a non-list member - who recently bought an '89 Vanagon 
&gt; &gt;&gt;that was equipped with alloy wheels.  As I recall from my Vanagon shopping 
&gt; &gt;&gt;days ('91 Westy) the alloy wheels, though gorgeous, had some pretty 
&gt; &gt;&gt;daunting care requirement/recommendations, such as weekly washing, 
&gt; &gt;&gt;avoiding certain detergents, etc, that were apparently related to 
&gt; &gt;&gt;corrosion problems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Yeah, the corrosion &amp; maintenance problems are really, really bad.  Tell him
&gt; &gt;he should get rid of those alloys right away!  By the way, I, uh, uh, uh,
&gt; &gt;could be persuaded to take them off his hands (not that I'd want the
&gt; &gt;headaches of course) for a maybe uh, uh, $20. each or $50. if I was &quot;forced&quot;
&gt; &gt;to take the whole set.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Jim you are such a very thoughtful person to offer this. In light of the
&gt; fact that everyone would sorely miss you here I cannot let you be so selfless.
&gt; 
&gt; But because I live in a non corrosion sphere I will volunteer to take these
&gt; unwanted and unsafe corroding death hoops myself. That's CASH baby.

Hey, fellas...my '71 is pretty much a rolling testimony to corrosion. If 
there's any way the allow wheels will bolt on, I think it would only be 
proper to add them the the campmobile, where they will feel at home.

We really are a considerate lot, aren't we? 8) Joe
