&gt; I was windering what people use instead of CV grease. CV grease
&gt; is gurrently going to $3.49 for a two ounce tube! I need at least
&gt; two tubes per CV, four CVs per car. Mabye more. Ouch!

That said amazingly enough when I did my '76 before selling last
fall for the hell of it I asked the parts guy how much for
CV grease, expecting a ridiculous amount.  Cost was $10 for the
14 oz tube of genuine Autobahn moly super shit.  I almost had
a heart attack and bought 2 tubes as I had just paid $4 for a
3 oz tube at AutoZone for my mom's Passat.  Goes to show you,
you never can tell.
