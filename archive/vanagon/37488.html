Subject: Re: Loose as a Goose

The local VW guru did the major brakework that she was needing.

New pads on the back, new rubber brake lines, and a new cylinder on 
one side.  Sand glaze off front pads (since they were doing ALL of 
the work).  New bearing on drivers front.
======
i remember telling you a while ago to check those brake lines.  (doncha love
it)


no comment on the muffler.  


Again, the stupid bolts that hold the gear reduction box to the rear 
swing-arm have come loose!

I _lost_ the main one, so when you accelerate or decelerate the rear 
of the bus goes all crazy wabbly and you have to steer to correct it.
I noticed it was gone, so decided to check the rest.  Two of the 
three rear bolts were loose!
===========
SCAREEEE!!   You dont want that to fall out from under you!   

Since this is my third time around at losing the main bolt, I've got 
some big plans.  I understand there is a heavy duty lock-tite stuff 
that will work to hold it in.

Does anyone have any experience with this stuff?  I plan to use some 
carb cleaner and a tooth-brush to get the hole cleaned out thoroughly, 
and get a new bolt and throw it back in with the lock-tite.  I'm sick 
of having a crazy steering bus!
=======
how are your threads?   instead of locktite, i would get the wonky bolt holes
bored out to a slightly larger size, and use the corresponding slightly
larger bolts.  i did this and was happy.  Then again, you could just weld the
d#_at_* thing on..........
