&gt;great!  Now I just need to build the cabinets to house the appliances.
&gt;It was about this point I realized that I suck at carpentry.  Anyone
&gt;wanna help me build some cabinets?  :)

I don't know what you are going to use for wood, but DON'T use laminate 
covered particle board except for the table. The stuff is fine for 
stationary use, but the vibration and flexing of your van will cause glue 
joints to crumble and screws to work loose. The cabinets last a few months 
before they soften. I got this from a British used VW salesman who warned me 
against one particular companies conversions because of this. He wouldn't 
sell them. Birch faced ply is nicest, tho' pricey. Use corner braces 
/gussets etc. and glue/screw every joint.
