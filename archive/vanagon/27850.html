&gt;&gt;The kit will give you a whopping extra 2311cc in capacity (to around 
19100cc
&gt;&gt;from memory) and is probably the biggest bang for buck you can get with a
&gt;&gt;1700.
&gt;
&gt;19,100cc's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     WOW!!!!!!!              I WANT ONE OF
&gt;THOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can you imagine how fast the Westy would go with this?


Not very. The crankshaft would stand still, and the Westy would spin over 
and over very quickly.   :)
