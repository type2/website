Which reminds me, I've got a question about a whatnot, I think?

I got up early this am and had planned to take the slack out of the
steering wheel. It's a 73 Beetle, and once I took a gander at the worm
adjusting screw, or whatever you call it, I simply let the thing back
down off the jack stands.

What size hex socket does that thing take? The Hanes manual doesn't say.
I had enough trouble with the darn 17mm plugs for the transaxle.
