Subject: Re: Need Passat Parts.

    I was just at my favorite junk yard and no Passat. but if it comes 
down to it I know where to get new VW parts at 33.7% off list.  

    HTTP://dealernet_dot_com look under VW and goto Parr Volkswagen inder 
parts and service.  The discount is standard and there guys are great!

    hope you find one

&gt;OK, flame me, but seriously with the amount the people on
&gt;this list wondering the junkyards I feel I might as well ask.
&gt;I need a front bumper cover for my mom's '90 Passat wagon
&gt;(silver metallic would be real nice).  I've tried most of
&gt;the major VW specialty yards (Cambell Nelson, Parts Place,
&gt;BMVW) to no avail and don't want to buy new for obvious reasons$
&gt;Locally, no luck and not even in the Pittsburg area so if
&gt;anyone could get me a lead, please help.  I actually only
&gt;need the spoiler, and lower grill, but the grill may be integral
&gt;to the cover (1 piece in fiche, appears 2 in real life) I'm
&gt;looking to give a couple hundred for the bumper cover and maybe
&gt;$30 or so for the spoiler, the cheaper the better, and of course
&gt;I need to take shipping this monster into account in cost as well.
&gt;
&gt;Any help most appreciated.
