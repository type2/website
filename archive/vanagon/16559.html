        Armand's Chicago Pizzeria is a yearly tradition for our Senior 
        Trip.  The food/service is good but there certainly is an almost  
        total lack of parking.  Try getting there in a couple of 
        Trailways busses.  Much more difficult than my 72 Westy.  The 
        area is a little far for me to go for pizza or I would join you.
        
        Peace,
