&gt; OK, doctors and mechanics, get ready to make a diagnosis.

&gt; The patient is my 1969 VW Camper (red, of course).
&gt; 
&gt; After driving about 400 km in cool, dry conditions two things happened 
&gt; simultaneously.  My alternator/generator light (red) came on and stayed 
&gt; on.  At the same time a strange but not very loud noise came from the 
&gt; engine compartment - sort of a 'whupping' sound.  We finished the drive 
&gt; as we were only 5 km from home.  We suspected that the sound may have 
&gt; been a broken belt of some kind and that the light came on because the 
&gt; battery was consequently no longer charging.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon inspection of the engine compartment we found oil had spattered the 
&gt; inside of the compartment.  The only obvious belt, the fan belt, is 
&gt; intact and does not appear to be slipping.  The engine did not appear to 
&gt; be overly hot at that time (although that observation is not 100%).
&gt; 
&gt; I have not seriously worked on figuring out what's wrong yet.  This has 
&gt; much to do with the fact that I am a mechanical gumby and it's much 
&gt; easier to ask those who might *know* the answer.
&gt; 
&gt; My bible (&quot;How to keep your VW alive&quot;) does not seem to link the red 
&gt; light with anything that might explain the oil.  Is it two problems or 
&gt; one?  What is/are the problems?  What kind of repair effort am I looking 
&gt; at here?
&gt; 
&gt; Any guesses would be greatly appreciated.

Okay...
Here's my GUESS.
or at least my SUGGESTION.

1)  A &quot;Whupping&quot; sound and the red light action sounds similar to an 
experience I had with a couple of generators.  --- The shaft bearings 
were beginning to wear and the pulley was sooner or later going to begin 
eating into the generator itself, I found lots of tiny metal filings all 
over my engine compt.  This &quot;whupping&quot; sound was also indicated by an 
obviously less than circular motion of the gen. pulley.
I replaced the generator.


2)  For oil all over the compt. I would look at the multiple joints in 
the oil spout.  My spout would often come loose at one or more of these 
joints and make a tremendous mess.  Once I stopped in Albany TX and 
bought some silicon sealer which solved the problem for a while.  (It 
was also entertaining for all the folks in this little west TX town.)


These are just guesses, and an attempt to get this discussion moving.
