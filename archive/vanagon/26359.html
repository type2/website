Subject: Need Passat Parts.

OK, flame me, but seriously with the amount the people on
this list wondering the junkyards I feel I might as well ask.
I need a front bumper cover for my mom's '90 Passat wagon
(silver metallic would be real nice).  I've tried most of
the major VW specialty yards (Cambell Nelson, Parts Place,
BMVW) to no avail and don't want to buy new for obvious reasons$
Locally, no luck and not even in the Pittsburg area so if
anyone could get me a lead, please help.  I actually only
need the spoiler, and lower grill, but the grill may be integral
to the cover (1 piece in fiche, appears 2 in real life) I'm
looking to give a couple hundred for the bumper cover and maybe
$30 or so for the spoiler, the cheaper the better, and of course
I need to take shipping this monster into account in cost as well.

Any help most appreciated.
