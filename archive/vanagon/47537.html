Subject: Re: basic electronics question

&gt; jeez, why didn't i pay attention more back in high school?
&gt; 
&gt; question:
&gt; 
&gt; i have a super bright , jumbo LED that reqires 2.6v _at_ 50ma
&gt; 
&gt; how do i figure the resistance of the dropping resistor for a 12v 
&gt; source?
&gt;

V = IR (?)

You actually are running about 14v in the car, and normal LED's have
about that 2.5v drop across them, so you want a resistor that will pass
50ma at 11.5v.  If you round to 12v (after all, resistors are commonly
only 10% accurate), this works out to 240 ohms -- 12 = (.050)x(240).
Notice that by doing this though, you mostly heat up the resistor rather
that produce light.  You might want to series a bunch of these (like 5)
which will give five times the light for the same current draw.
