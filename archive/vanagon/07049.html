Subject: RE: 6 cyl. Vanagon

Derek Drew points out the difficulty that the Porsche conversion has for those
whose Vanagons have an absurd-looking second grill and who feel the need to
carry around gallons of incombustible fluid other than diet soda.

It is true that the Porsche heater boxes are only a little better than the
VW heater boxes, so a gas heater is needed in serious weather.  I've heard
of people making their own ducts to put the air-cooled engine in a late body
and still get defrost and foot-warming, but you're right, Derek:  the 911
conversion is primarily for those of us who already have a combination of 
aircooled van and temperate climate that we are satisfied with.

The hot tip for waterpumpers is either Mazda rotary, or any American V-6.
That's way out of my wrenching league, tho', and the 911 engine was not.
Note that Kennedy Engineered Products (no relation) can help with those fly-
wheel matchups too.
