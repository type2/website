Subject: Help!!!

I am the consequential owner of a 1987 Vanogon Syncro.  I need help with an
electrical/ignition problem that won't go away for more than three months at
a time.  My van acts like there is water in the fuel and runs very rich and
coughs black smoke.  Power loss is evident and the idle is very rough.  Every
once in a while it runs wonderfully as if a mechanic were standing right
there.  Other times the power loss episodes are erratic and random.  When it
is acting up pressing the accellerator to the floor clears it up with a jolt
of power and accelleration... let up on the gas and it starts jerking and
coughing again.  It has new heads; alternator; waterpump; CPU; plugs; wires;
cap/rotor; air filter; etc....   Help me!!!!
My name is Neal Helfman and my e-mail address is;

diagnosis!!!   Thankyou
