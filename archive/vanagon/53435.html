Same pipe broke on my transporter about six month after I got a &quot;bargain
muffler&quot; installed. It seems this new muffler did not have all the OEM
attachment points. The pipe was now doing more  work than it was
designed for. VW wants $100+ for that small piece of pipe. 
Good Luck

&gt;1. my tailpipe split between the part where it forks and the catalytic
&gt;converter. What is that part, it's the small piece that has the O2 
&gt;sensor
&gt;on it.
&gt;
&gt;2. will i cause permanent damage driving without that piece? (it broke 
&gt;off
&gt;completely)
&gt;
&gt;3. What could cause this: after I warm up and have been driving, the
&gt;engine revs to 1200 and then drops back off to 1000, then back to 
&gt;1200,
&gt;then back to 1000. It does this non-stop at idle speed but runs fine 
&gt;at adrive.
&gt; Any help would be great, THANKS!!!! Jarrett
