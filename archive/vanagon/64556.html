 &gt; I've watched and waited but lately, no one has brought up shocks--So
 &gt; here goes.
 &gt;
 &gt; My creame puff 84 Westy needs a more stable ride, she needs to toughen
 &gt; up a bit!
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm interested in the Readers experience on specific shocks.  I would
 &gt; like some very HD, non air shocks.  I am open to suggestions and have a
 &gt; frugal budget. &gt;&gt;

Suzy and I did the same (KYB Nitro's all around) and I thought I had my
Porsche back! Okay, that's an exageration, but it was much better.

giving shocking news,
