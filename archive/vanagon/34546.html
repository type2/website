Subject: Repost - 1980 Vanagon seats
Date: Mon, 5 Feb 1996 08:27:06 -0500

All,

Sorry about the duplicate post.  I did not put a subject heading in =
previously :(...DBR

Is there a way to install temporary seats in the open space between the =
driver's/passenger's front seats and the bench seats in the back of the =
80 Vanagon.  There is a *lot* of space there and when not camping, it =
would be nice to use it for seating.  What say ye?
