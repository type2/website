Subject: late 80's vanagons



	
	I've been leering at those fancy late 80's
	vangons, GLs, Wolfsburg editions, whatever.
	I envy the heated seats, power mirrors and all
	the little improvements in the interior, esp. the
	dash with its little molded tray. But there is
	one thing I'm not sure of - those black vent
	thingies in the rear side windows. Are they
	for improving &quot;flo thru vennelashun&quot;, are they
	adjustable?
	Not the most pressing question in my life, but
	hey, if I can't ask it here, where can I?

	Alistair
