Subject: Car jack or axl stand

One quick question.  I'm slowly building my collection of tools.  As I go to 
check for wheel bearing problems tonight, is it safe to put the van up on 
the car jack while I work on it, or do I need to get an axl stand?  BTW, is 
axl the correct spelling?  What an odd looking word.
