Subject: Famous Splitty Owners

Doing the mag for SSVC I often have to deal with requests from companies
wanting Splits for TV programmes or adverts etc then try and track down a
suitable van plus willing owner. (Anyone seen the stretch Samba used by
Compuserve with the slogan &quot;No - one takes more people netsurfing&quot; - it is a
clever fake stretch and weird paintjob, much to the owners relief)
Recently we had the Rolling Stones agent trying to track down the Split used
by the band to tour in '63. As no-one in the band could even remember the
colour let alone the reg no. (surprise surprise) we could not help (though
rumour was that Bill might have a pic but as he was persona non grata..)

My best one was a company called Ten Tenths rang me to track a suitable Split
for new VW People Carrier Ads...conversation went sort of
&quot;Yeah right, so any help would be nice David. Actually the band I was in used
to drive one of them things..but we outgrew it..&quot;
ME :Oh you were in a band?
&quot;Yeah..we used that old van a lot in the early days&quot;
ME: What band was that then
&quot;Pink Floyd&quot;
Duhhhhhh! I am not worthy etc etc..
seems Nick Mason runs Ten Tenths with his Ferrari Collection being the core...
