&gt; 
&gt; On the receipt:  0258-003-913  3-wire Oxy sensor $65.19
&gt; 
&gt; On the box were the numbers: 610328 021 13913.  13913 were also in big numbers
&gt; on the end of the box.  This oxy sensor is for Ford/Mercury cars, and does 
&gt; not have the correct plug, so you have to use the connector from your old 
&gt; sensor.

Alas, I have a 1-wire sensor (1985 Vanagon) do they sell this item as well?
