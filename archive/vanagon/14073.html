&gt; i'm not sure, but i think it has something to do with the &quot;rear&quot; being the
&gt; steering wheels (when you have it in reverse). i've noticed this with
&gt; forklifts and front-end-loaders. you have to be really careful steering them
&gt; especially with a load.
&gt; 
&gt; why this is true, i have not idea. maybe it's because the steering wheels
&gt; are not trying to &quot;plow&quot; ahead on their own, and therefore grip better. ??

It's sort of an illusion.  Going forward the front wheels make a turn and 
the back wheels follow with a turn 'inside' the front.  In reverse the 
front wheels make the same radius turn but outside the leading rear 
wheels.  Not sure if I explained that clearly....
