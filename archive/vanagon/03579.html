&gt; Since we're on the subject of breaking into VWs and such, a few years back,
&gt; after my very *last* final (or so I thought, at the time), my brain was toast
&gt; and my mind was gone, but a couple of my housemates and I felt devious enough
&gt; to break into some woman jogger's Type III (same way as the busses, through the
&gt; wing window) that she wantonly parked in our parking spaces.  Seems she'd drive
&gt; up, park, go for a jog around the greenbelt, jump back in her car and drive
&gt; off.  
&gt; Well, some of us were getting a little steamed about the parking space thing,
&gt; so one day we break in, pin up a Playboy centerfold (I don't recall the
&gt; month/yr) smack dab in the center of her dash, and then lock the car back up
&gt; and wait.  Well, she gets back, unlocks the car, gets in and notices 
&gt; the fine calling card we left behind.  Long pause, takes it off the dash, looks
&gt; around nervously, then drives off, never to be seen again.

very good, although i may not have used a centerfold. mainly because of 
the posible sexist acusations that might come up.
