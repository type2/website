While you others are on the subject of hubcaps for your '84 I just
remembered that my '87 is missing one (hubcap) that is.  Anyone out there
got a spare ?  Why would you have a spare ?  I don't know but if you do my
'87 needs it !  Well, I'm not sure it really NEEDS it but it would &quot;look&quot;
better with all four in place.

Cheers,

Frank
