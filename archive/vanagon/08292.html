Subject: Volume (how to minimize it)
Date: Fri, 16 Dec 1994 08:48:00 -0800 (PST)

I guess I've been lurking on the list, since I said I was unsubscribing
due to volume and have hung around.  Actually, I did unsubscribe for
about six hours, then re-subscribed because I didn't want to miss info
on the West Coast Gathering (Yes, I am still planning to come.  I am
just procrastinating on making arrangements.)

To get to the real subject of this message, I'd like to suggest a few
ways to reduce the volume on the list and help those of us who simply
don't have time to read all of the messages:

1) PLEASE stop sending messages to the list about the dearth of
   messages.  I think we all know that the chances of everyone deciding
   not to post are very remote, so please just wait patiently for problems
   with the list to be solved by Saint Gerry of Vanagon.

2) As mentioned in an earlier posting, don't quote an entire article
   just to add a line or two of text.  If you're adding to a list or
   replying to a specific question, then it's probably appropriate to
   quote, but quoting unrelated material in the same message is a waste
   of resources.

3) Keep your subject headers at least somewhat specific.  I'm not sure it's
   necessary to specify [f] for fun messages, since there is a bit of
   fun in most messages, even this one if you look close enough. :}
   However, as loaf-o-centric as this may sound, I don't care much about
   discussions relating to coolant, since neither of my vehicles has any
   (well, water-based coolant, that is), but I don't want to miss
   messages which deal with campers of any vintage. I don't like the
   feeling of deleting messages en-masse, but I personally prefer it to
   unsubscribing.  This also means that if you reply to a message, but go
   off on a tangent, then the subject line should be changed to reflect
   the new subject.

Sorry to sound like a Usenet-police wannabe, but as big as this list
has become, Newgroup guidelines are, for the most part, appropriate IMHO.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled mirth.
