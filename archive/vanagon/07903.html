&gt;&gt;I would be interested in hearing what was involved in installing the
&gt;&gt;vanagon seats.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;BTW, mine is green/yellow plaid, and I love it.  Very 1976.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks!

&gt;Let's see, this was several years back and I'm working from memory here...
&gt;
&gt;Remove the old seats, turn them upside down, and identify the four allen
&gt;screws which attach the runners to the driver's seat and the swivel to the
&gt;passenger's.
&gt;
&gt;Make careful measurements about the position of these screws and runners --
&gt;what you're going to do is mount then to the new seats.
&gt;
&gt;Now look at the bottom of the Vanagon seats.  They have a completely different
&gt;bolt pattern and runner assembly.  I don't recall of the screws are the same
&gt;thread.
&gt;Remove the mounts from the new seats.  If all goes well you will discard these
&gt;along with your old seats.  Remove the rails and swivel from the old seats
(snip)

what &quot;discard&quot; your old seats, never, put em' in storage (see note below)

RULE NUMBER ONE

NEVER, NEVER throw any old bus stuff out. You'll never know when
you/somebody else will need this stuff. I like to of all Westfalia think
stuff as invalueable.The minute you throw something out, the next day you
find a need for it. All you have to do is find places to store all these
possesions. I have managed to fill up the basement, the driveway, and a
storage garage BTW.
