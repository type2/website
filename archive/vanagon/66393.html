Subject:      Wetwestie's campout

Wow! For those of you who missed the wetwestie's campout at Susan
Crandall's the only term to use ( to quote Homer Simpson) is &quot;DOH!&quot;.   Not
only was the Crandall's collection of Westie's and Beattles great but the
Baywindows, Splits,  and Bricks driven to the campout were really nice.
The campground &quot;westie acres&quot; set up by Susan was a great camping area.
And if the tour of the bus collection was not enough, we had a fun time
using the old apple cider press on saturday afternoon to make the best
tasting cider I've ever had (but boy, are my arms sore today). If any of
the Vanagon list that  live in N. California, Oregon or Washington are not
on the wetwestie's list you need to plug in.  Thanks to Susan Crandall and
to Jack Maynard to making such a fun weekend!  Can't wait for the next one.
