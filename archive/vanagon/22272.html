Subject: Re: 40 years ago today...Rusty was born!

&gt;Sorry that this is a late post but I was out of town celebrating my 40th b-day.

(For real)
Rusty VanBondo aka &quot;Jim Ellis&quot; was born in Milwaukee General Hospital,
Milwaukee, Wisc.
Don't blame them, it wasn't their fault!


&gt;Forty years ago today....August 5, 1955, the ONE MILLIONTH VW
&gt;rolled off of the assembly line at Wolfsburg. The Millionth
&gt;Beetle was painted gold, had a rose-colored brocade cloth
&gt;interior (the cloth was brought in from Paris). The plant
&gt;was shut down for a special celebration.
&gt;
&gt;In the context of the times, one has to realize that just
&gt;10 years prior the plant, as well as most of Germany's
&gt;industrial base and economy, was in ruins, making this
&gt;part of what was referred to as &quot;Germany's Economic
&gt;Miracle&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;The &quot;Millionth Beetle&quot; currently resides in the VW museum
&gt;in Wolfsburg.
