&lt;&lt; Does anyone know what the 'Westfalia' lettering font is called?  (The

 I'm wondering because the Vanagon camper model doesn't come with a
 'Westfalia' decal, and I'm hoping to figure out how to do it myself. &gt;&gt;

A larger &amp; related question I'm interested in the answer to is:

Does anyone know of a software package used to create fonts of your own
design?

This might help Ron out too if there is no answer to his original question.
