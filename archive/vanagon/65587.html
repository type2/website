Subject:      plea for shorter postings

I can relate to the Mac user having trouble reading the Vanagon Digest
because it is too large. I don't have any trouble *reading* the digest
on my 300MHZ, 96MB DEC Alphastation, but I would rather read the
*meat* of the postings rather than scanning through hundreds of lines
of quoted text.

So my plea is this... instead of just hitting the 'reply' button and
quoting the entire message you are replying to, trim off the excess
quoted text, and leave just what is important to make the reply
meaningful.

Sorry for wasting bandwidth on this, but most digests are well over
two thousand lines!
