Subject: Don't Ignore Clutch Sounds

Learned an expensive lesson about ignoring clutch sounds on Vanagons. 
Thought it might be useful to others:

My 86 GL Syncro was making squealing sounds when the clutch was slipped to
take off from a stop.  Previous owner kept driving until the sound was
impossible to ignore, then sold it.

Turns out, the input shaft pilot bearing had burned up (the little needle
bearing in the end of the crankshaft that supports and centers the trans main
shaft).  While these bearings can run out of grease and get noisy, ignoring
the problem was a bad idea.

The trans shaft had started to wobble as the car was driven, and the end
result was so much wear to the trans shaft and bellhousing that they were
both unusable.  With new trans and main seals, clutch disc and throwout,
fluids, it turned into a pretty extensive home repair.  Fortunately, Carter's
Gear Box in So. Ca. was able to send a good used bellhousing for $75 (they're
tough to find).  Total parts cost was about $400.  

The needle bearing itself was $6.90.  And the clutch had been renewed
previously.  Pilot bearing probably wasn't replaced, or wasn't lubed with
Bosch grease.  So, if the previous owner hadn't waited, someone could have
saved considerable wampum and time.  

The needle bearing problem is not uncommon in all Vanagons, 4WD or 2WD.  Just
don't let it go or you'll be sorry...

And Carter's could have easily jammed me for more than the $75  they charged,
which is a very strong suggestion to me that they are straight shooters.
 They even installed a new trans seal  before they shipped it, and didn't
charge me extra.  Keep their number handy - 909-866-2221.- but hope you don't
need it.
