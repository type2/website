Subject: Clutch Problems

Looking for help.  I have an 85 Vanagon who's clutch doesn't want to
disengage.  My local mechanic says best to replace both the master
cylinder (under dash) and slave cylinder (above transaxle).  I think
there has to be a less expensive option.   Of course I've thought
this before.  There is no sign of leakage at either cylinder and I
figured there should be a rebuild kit for the slave cylinder.  My
mechanic says rebuilds don't work.  I had a Ford Cortina that I
rebuilt the slave cylinder on and it worked fine.  Any suggestions
out there?  Anyone run into this problem that would like to share
their experience?
