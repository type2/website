Subject: Medium Blue paint code
Date: Wed, 4 Dec 96 15:40:05 EST

Hello all,
The medium blue touch-up paint I ordered from the dealer came in today.
If anyone's interested, the paint code is LH5.  There is also a G.1 on
the bottle right after the paint code, I don't know if that's part of
the code or not.  The paint bottle comes with a neat little deruster
(basically a teeny wire brush) that stores in the cap when you're not
using it.  You get 18 milliliters for your $5.49, which should be plenty
to do lots of touching up.  

FYI,
Sean
