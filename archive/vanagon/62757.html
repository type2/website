I had all the windows tinted on my '85 Westi and it makes a big difference
in the heat in the car.  A good side effect is that it cuts UVA/UVB by
~96%.  I would definitely do it again.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I'd really like some advice on what sort of insulation to use.
&gt;  I want convenience and neatness of installation,  I want good
&gt;  insulating properties (sound, and heat.) &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; John (and others)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure others can add more to this,  but be carefull with polyurethane, it
&gt; will keep expanding for some time during installation and can expand enough
&gt; to destroy your panels,  but more imporant,  in a fire it is DEADLY...  DO
&gt; NOT hang around if it catches fire!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Fiberglass and rockwool can add a lot of irritants in the air for you to
&gt; breathe.  The movement of the van while on the road can constantly shed tiny
&gt; fiber particles that find their way out of any crack.
&gt; 
&gt; Those are my only two known problems, but don't take my word on it, there are
&gt; many types of insulations and many ways to apply them.  I'm hoping others
&gt; will have more to say about this..............
&gt; 
&gt; And while we're on the subject,  I'm interested if anyone has experimented
&gt; with ways to increase the efficiency of the AC by treating the windows with
&gt; coatings, films or shades.  I have the stock Westy windows in an 87 GL
&gt; Syncro.  Any ideas???
