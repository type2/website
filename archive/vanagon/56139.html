&gt; &gt; 	  I also noticed and  I'm not sure if this is true for all VW CV joints
&gt;  &gt; but all of the ones I have done for VW buses are all marked with a date
&gt;  &gt; of manufacter. Just in case your wondering if your CV joint is original
&gt;  &gt; or not.  Mine were marked 12/82. Now one side is marked 5/79. 
&gt;  
&gt;  This is true at least of all OEM Bus/Vanagon IRS CV's and all FWD VW
&gt;  CV's I have seen.  Showed this fact to Steve Dolan the other weekend in 
&gt;  fact, but here is a puzzler, I always assumed the marking was month/
&gt;  year, but I got one downstairs marked 14/81, long year I guess, 
&gt;  ideas?  

Many manufacturers mark products with the WEEK &amp; YEAR for a finer resolution
than just by the month.  I suspect 14/81 meant early April, 1981.
