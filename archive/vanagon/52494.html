hmm..sounds like you need something to make it stay where you put it..

does it spin on the shaft, or how does it work? mabe glue, or a pin glued 
into a hole you make....if you get the pont...but, since i havent ever 
opened one..i'm not sure..should be someway to keep it where it needs to 
be...is there something broken off theat used to hold it?
hmm....david

&gt; Help!
&gt; My odometor stop working, so I followed the advice given by list member for
&gt; removal.  The gears were not broken, but just out of place.  I pushed the
&gt; assembly to the right and gears were engaging just fine.  Put everything
&gt; back together and it worked great for about two days, but now we are back to
&gt; the same old thing.  What more do I need to do?
