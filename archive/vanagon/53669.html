What research ? I'm curious! I would on intuition think synthetics are
recyclable, but as for them being &quot;accross-the-board&quot; *better* than
conventional &quot;cracked&quot; oils ... not necessarily. The specific heat of
synthetics is relatively lower than conventional oils, thus they are not
as good conductors/transducers of (engine) heat. Although the primary
function of oil in an air-cooled engine is lubrication, the secondary is
&quot;cooling&quot; (c.f., oil-coolers popular with older model buses or baja bugs).
Thus an oils heat absorbing properties (e.i., specific heat capacity) are
also a critical component of it's functionality and usefulness in any
vehicle. Synthetics generally lack this functionality (relative to
conventional oils). To be just to synthetics, it's also my understanding
that this &quot;problem&quot;is addressed (to a limited degree) is via the addition
of &quot;heat-absorbing additives&quot; to their synthetic oils.

Two other reasons I refrain from using synthetics are costs ($3-4/qt vs.
$1/quart) and that I change my oil about every 3/4K miles ... not so much
because of conventional oil breakdown, but because of the grim and dirt
that accumulates in our oil. Synthetics don't have this breakdown
&quot;problem&quot; (generally 12K miles/oil change), but I for one wouldn't want
12K/miles worth of grim and grit running through my engine. Conventional
oil is cheap, new engines aren't.
