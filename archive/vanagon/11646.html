Subject: Re: roof racks

Michael, I just happen to have the '94/'95 Yakima catalog sitting in front of 
me. Other than the bolt on &quot;fake rain gutters&quot; that you don't want to use, they 
have a &quot;1A Hi Rise Tower&quot; that might work (It's rain gutter mounted, part 
#0104). The fiberglass top is awful high though, and I don't know if this tower 
will extend the bar over it. I have called them in the past, and they are very 
helpful. They also maintain a list of the best &quot;fit combinations&quot; of their 
products on virtually any car in the universe.

Their catalog does not list any high rise towers for their 2 newer series of 
towers (the 1C SST and QTR).

Their (hard-to-find-kind-of-for-dealers-only-but-they'll-let-anybody-use-it) 
toll free number is (800) 468-9000. (Also (707) 826-8000). Tell them you are a 
consumer seeking rack fit information.

I don't have any experience with Thule. I have had Yakima's for years with 
excellent luck. My sister had Thule's, and the racks (tied to 2 mountain bikes) 
blew off the roof at 70 mph. Thule replaced the racks, but you can make your own
choice....

&gt; i recall there being a thread on roofracks a month or so ago, but my
&gt; question has a slightly different spin on it.
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of mine is looking for roofracks that bolt on to the raingutter of
&gt; a 87' Westfalia. I know that Yakima and Thule make such roofracks (that can
&gt; clear the height of the fibreglass roof) but I have forgotten the part or
&gt; model #'s of these roofracks. Does anybody out there know the part or model
&gt; # for these racks for either yakima or thule?
&gt; 
&gt; Also any thoughts on who makes a better roofrack. I realize that bolting
&gt; the roofrack to the fibreglass top offers more convenience in term of
&gt; opening and closing the roof, but my friend doesn't want any holes drilled
&gt; in the pop top.
