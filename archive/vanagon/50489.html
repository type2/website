   Well, I had to re-check with him after I had thought about this a 
 while, I now that a few List-Members have thrown Rods out their 2.1 
 engines and have been looking for good cores.  Here's the info you 
 people have been needing to see!  Unless we have inside connections, WE 
 (consumers) don't find out about things like this!!! &gt;&gt;

I don't think this is any &quot;secret&quot; policy.  This is the same as my local
dealer told me, and I've previously written about it on the list.

It is worth repeating though.
