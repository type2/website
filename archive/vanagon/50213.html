&gt; -- [ From: Thomas D. Hanlon * EMC.Ver #2.3 ] -- 
&gt;  
&gt; Listees, 
&gt;  
&gt; Prompted by the discussion on the list about motor homes, house tags 
&gt; and insurance, I called my insurance carrier here in Texas, GEICO, 
&gt; and explained that upon registration of the vehicle, I had failed 
&gt; to specify that my Vanagon was a Westfalia,&quot;a motor home' and certified 
&gt; as such by the California Department of Motor Vehicles in the state 
&gt; in which I bought the vehicle.

&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;

&gt; she researched the 
&gt; topic and telephoned with the pleasant news of a reduction in premium 
&gt; of about 45 percent for the year. 
&gt;  
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;

hi-

i just tried the same thing, also with GEICO, and was quoted an INCREASE of 
$20/mo.  when i told her i wasn't interested, she advised that none of the 
inside of the van would be covered by insurance.  i kept saying that it was a 
motor home, and she kept talking about conversion vans.  i told her that while  
there was a conversion done on the van (in germany, by westfalia), it was 
bought new from a dealer as a motor home.

advice/comments welcomed
