&gt;The badder news is that my cold start injector isn't injecting.
&gt;Hopefully its the thermo time switch.  If it is, I am thining
&gt;about wiring a switch to the dash to manually do it.
&gt;Anyone done this?

i knew a guy who had a volvo 240 with l-jetronic efi (which should be
the same as yours) and he did exactly that. as far as i know, he's still
driving the car like that (that was about 8 years ago).
