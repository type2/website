So Dave Spalding says:

&gt; Doug says:
&gt; &gt;Alan Funt was the MC of some gameshow, though the name of
&gt;           the show escapes me at this time.
&gt; 
&gt; This has NOTHING to do with VW's, but I can't take it any longer!!  What planet
&gt; are you from!!!??  Haven't you even HEARD of CANDID CAMERA?  Where where you in
&gt; the 60's!!??  Am I that old?

Dave,

Don't these youngin's just make you want to hang your head and cry?  ;)

&gt; OVWC:  One Candid Camera bit involved a Bug body split down the middle and
&gt; mounted on two motorcycles.  The two riders would pilot their 1/2 Bugs down the
&gt; street together, looking like one complete Bug.  Then they would do something
&gt; like one turns left while the other turns right, or splitting and going on
&gt; either side of a pedestrian, then joining up again, etc.  The reactions of
&gt; casual observers to these antics were very funny.

I remember that one.  The used to play it alot at the end of the show during
the credits.

For the best of Candid Camera/Alan Funt entertainment, you should rent the
video: &quot;What Do You Say To A Naked Lady?&quot;  Now that's entertainment.  Puts
that stupid Greatest American Videos and the Bloopers show to shame.
