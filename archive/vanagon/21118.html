Subject: Parts/Service in Minneapolis?

Hi bus dudes/dudettes.  I'm going to be in Minneapolis to
visit the old bro-in-law and will be checking out a '62
Kombi for sale while I'm there.  It is currently partly
dissasembled, and though I thought of renting some kind of
truck/trailer to haul it back and work on it at my leisure,
it costs too much.  So if I like the bus and buy it I'll
have to put it back together in said bro-in-law's garage.  I'll
have 4 or 5 days, but then the bus will have to drive all the
way to Ann Arbor (about 650 miles).

So what I would like to know, O Kind Minneapolis aircooled
fanatics, is:  are there reasonably well-stocked parts stores
nearby where I can get stuff I might need?  The engine runs and
is in good shape, what I need to buy is window and engine rubber,
and emergency parts like fan belts and tune up kits and maybe 
even paranoid just-in-case stuff like a voltage reg./coil, etc.

If anyone can recommend a shop that likes air-cooleds that would
be great too.  Also it needs the cargo door hinge carriers welded,
so a bodyshop rec. would be cool.

Thanks a ton in advance, I might leave tomorrow AM so hurry :-)

P.S. the bus has a 1600 dp engine (12 volt).
