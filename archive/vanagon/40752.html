Subject: R12 to R134 conv


Just wondering if anyone on the list has any information on the refrigerant
changes (R-12 to R-134) that we all may be facing in the next 2 years or
so.  Does VW have any conversion kits yet for the Vanagon, any mention of
what the cost might be?  GM says their upgrades may be $500 to $600 while
Fords may run $1000 to $1200.

      TIm,
       I have complete details on converting all VW air conditioning
       systems from R12 to R134. I was going to put them on the list
       but can't find the time. (To much work to do on the syncro).
       Summer is on it's way. Maybe I better get my priorities straight.
       It's real simple, and cheap if I can remember the only thing you
       need is a new dryer and some fittings.
