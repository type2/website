Well, that's actually cool 'cause I am taking it out of there and putting
it in Lazarus ('69 Westy) which is why I bought Mary Margaret so since i
have to take it out ANYWAY that is no biggee.

I am, however, concerned about the compression readings.  I did it again
today.  After being warmed up I pulled the plugs and got:
90
120
100
100

After I squirted oil in all four I tested it:

90
120
100
100

Please help me to understand these readings.

Thanks!

&gt;&gt;I got it home and parked it and it proceeded to dump about a 1/2 pint of
&gt;&gt;oil in a pool on the ground.  It then slowed to just a drip and then pretty
&gt;&gt;much stopped.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Any suggestions?  Please tell me it is not engine killing as that was the
&gt;&gt;main reason for getting this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It sounds like your flywheel end crank seal is going / gone. This
&gt;slowly leaks oil while the engine is running, which gets flailed
&gt;around inside the bell-housing. Then, when you stop, it all runs down,
&gt;&amp; out of the hole in the bottom ! (My '71 did the same).
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, it's an engine-out job to fix it. It will only get
&gt;worse, and will eventually saturate your clutch with oil. The seal is
&gt;cheap. No doubt someone will recommend the best type to get......
&gt;
&gt;Causes ? :
&gt;
&gt;Bad luck - a seal may just decide to give up, especially if the engine
&gt;has been standing;
&gt;
&gt;Crank end-float - excessive end-float in the crank makes these seals
&gt;wear quickly. It can be assessed (with the engine in the van) by
&gt;grabbing the crank pulley (engine stopped !!!) and alternately trying
&gt;to pull it bodily out of the back of the van, and push it through the
&gt;engine. If it moves (backwards &amp; forwards, not round &amp; round) enough
&gt;for you to *see* it (rather than just feel/hear a clunk, then there
&gt;may be excessive end-float.
&gt;
&gt;Either way, you'll have to replace the seal. FWIW, as long as there's
&gt;no sign of a huge amount of play in the crank, I'd replace it with the
&gt;best you can get, and see how long it lasts. Others will^H^H^H^H may
&gt;dissagree.... ;-&gt;
