Subject: Error in Franklin Mint Ad in VW rags



Hi Volks!

I hope this hasn't been covered before (in which case I'm going to be quite
red in the face).

In the current issue of VW Trends, there is an ad for a Karmann Gia model from
Franklin Mint.

This is a little error in the ad and I was wondering if anyone else caught it.
I'm not talking about the bad grammar here either.  I'm talking about something 
very fundamental.  To me at least:-)

I'll give an absolutely free virtual handshake to the first person that can 
identify the error.

Have fun!

Oh yeah, I don't work for Franklin Mint, and don't own anything from them.  A friend
of mine once had something from them.  I can't remember what it was, but I seem
to recall that it had something to do with Elvis?!?!  I asked him but he couldn't
remember either...apparently he sold it in a garage sale a looong time ago.  But
before he sold it, he thinks he was quite happy with it. Your milage may vary.
