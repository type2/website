Subject: '66 Split Window (two)

Went out to Cave Junction, Ore this morning and looked at a '66
Has an &quot;F0&quot; engine possible original 1300. Rust: bottom of side doors
and I think a piece of the panel under the doors.Not gone but need 
surgery. Drivers floor is cancer, about 12&quot; square. Right rear corner
is caved but fixable. This is the 4? windows behind door job. All
windows are there tho drivers window has full length crack.
Spare is bolted to front with 3 rusty bolts, no apparent cancer in 
area (like the spare didn't fall on me when I pulled on it). 
Battery area on right side rear is gone. Cute board to cover it.
Rear fender wells cut back tastefully to get the BIG RUBBER in there.
The head liner is in good shape. The wall stuff is gone and some one
has started stuffing insulation in. There is no interior except head
liner. Not even the driver seat. Dash is clean and all there.

The other one: He tells me a guy gave him the other one and it is sitting
outside at Lake Selmac (few miles away) the whole interior 
is gone he says and rust has settled in on everything. Has rougher body and
no engine. The windows are there but some broken. No title
abandoned on property and owner wants to sell property.So gave him
Van. Still has tranny. 

I told him maybe four hundred on the one and tow the other out of
the damn woods before total destruct. He doesn't think it's worth
his while. I mentioned a couple hundred as his reward perhaps.

My own situation is I'm over extended on damn VW's.
I have to drag a '72 van home tomorrow and another bug 
the first of week if close. I already have one that needs 
engine and my own needs paint etc.
I think I pass on the splitty deal to you all if some one
has a need. If you don't want then give me an opinion any way.
