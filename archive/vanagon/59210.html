Subject: Re: Window Tinting

I'll explain how window film is rated by darkness:

50%	This is the lightest tint available.  It blocks out all UV rays 
	and provides a slightly darker look to the glass.  50% of the light
	which hits the window actually makes it through the film

35%	Most states which limit window tinting, use this as their limit.  35%
	light transmittance.

20%	This film is very dark, only allowing 20% of the light to pass 
	through it.

Limo tint can be anywhere from 5-10% light transmittance.
Black out tint is 0-5%

Window film is also rated on reflectance.  Full mirror film is 100% and 
is not legal in any states anymore, that i know of.

The percentages are estimates.  We checked some 20% 3M film with a 50% 
reflectance rating with a light meter.  Only 17% light transmittance was 
found.
