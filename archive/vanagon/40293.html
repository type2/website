Don't know, but those covers have saved me from losing a headlight a
couple of times now.  Definitely silly to stop using them, IMHO.

Unless yours is wired significantly differently from of the microbusi
that I've seen, those are your parking lights.  Try turning just those
on, and look at what comes on.  I find they can actually be more
useful than the headlights sometimes, when I'm worried more about
side-swiping something (and moving relatively slowly, of course).

Make doubly sure you have five watt bulbs.  The more-common ten watt
version will melt your bulb covers.
