Subject: Re: WESTFALIA ADVICE NEEDED!

Greetings: Strange that we are both own KG cabriolets, both live in Ottawa
and both have a desire for a Westy (mine fulfilled). My personal
experience has been to purchase a good California version and bring it
back to Canada, and to get the Vanagon version. Why? Well you are unlikely
to find a good 70's Westy in these parts,  and even though the 70's
version may look better (very debatable) it has substantially less room and is
not as well equipped as the 80's variations. There is a FAQ which will
describe the differences between the models but essentially it comes down
to better handling, more space, smarter design and more refined design of
the FI system and engine. I would even go one step further and say that of
all the Westy versions from the 50's up to the Eurovan the Vanagon Westy
is the best....judging from the number of 80s Westys on the road even in
winter up here, I think many Canadians would agree with me. They most likely
have them treated with Rustcheck or OilGard on an annual basis.

 Others on the list
will have substantially different opinions on what you should
consider buying - good luck ......DC
BTW I suggest you scan the FAQ's first before making a decision. These will
tell you which years to avoid....
