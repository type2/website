&gt;As for the repair, here's what he said. The right head gasket is leaking
&gt;and the left is ok. The gasket kit is $190 per side. When the mechanic
&gt;pulls the head, he'll know if the head needs replacing due to pitting,
&gt;but he said that almost always it will need replacing ($560 for the head).
&gt;(He sounded like he's seen this before!) He very strongly recommended
&gt;replacing the left side gasket since I'd probably be back in six months
&gt;to have that one done anyway. The left side head may be ok, but he wouldn't
&gt;know until it's off. Labor for the whole job is 13 hours _at_ $52/hr. Total
&gt;cost with two gasket kits, two heads, and labor: $2200. Ouch, ouch, ouch!
&gt;
That sounds about right.  If you get a buy in from VW to pay for part of it,
do your best to have them cover both heads.  If one is leaking today, the
other will lilely leak soon.


&gt;You know, the whole time I talked with him, I got the feeling he was
&gt;drawing on a significant pool of cases like this, i.e., he'd seen it
&gt;before and not just once or twice.

Probably on most of the Vanagons in the area.

&gt;
&gt;So, now to write a letter to VWoA. If anyone has any advice on influencing
&gt;VWoA on this, I'd appreciate it...
&gt;
I'd suggest that you try to set up an appointment with the rep in person at
the VW dealer.  I think that they'd have a harder time saying &quot;NO&quot; in person
than through the mail.

Good Luck,
