Subject:      FS-Westy stove, sink, refridgerator unit

I know someone that wants to sell the whole stove, sink, and refridgerator
unit out of a damaged 83 Westfalia.  He wants to get $250 plus shipping for
it.  All components were in very good, clean condition, and the fridge has
all of the plastic pieces fully intact.  The color was tan with brown trim.

Email me and I'll put him in touch with you.
