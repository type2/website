&gt;So to get to the point:  how does one definitively diagnose a head

well ... this is what vw says:

Cold Feet, Hot Tip

A slight &quot;internal&quot; compression leak into the coolant system of a water-
cooled Vanagon is not always easily diagnosed.  But what your customer
tells your Service Advisor may be very helpful to pinpoint such a
problem:
*  Temperature gauge needle moves into the red
*  Very little or no heat output
*  Coolant refill tank overflows
*  Air in the coolant system
If one or a combination of these symptoms apply, be suspicious of a
compression leak between cylinder sleeve and cylinder head.  Either
the metal sealing ring (1) or the 'O' ring (2), or both may be damaged.

(1) is the outer most sealing ring; next to the cylinder head.
(2) is the inner most sealing ring; next to the cylinder sleeve.
