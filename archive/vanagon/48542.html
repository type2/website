&gt;    I started down a steep, paved hill, in creeper gear. As the gears 
&gt;    started to wind up I thru in the clutch to shift from creeper 
&gt;    gear to second or third. Before I had a chance to get it out 
&gt;    of gear, I was slammed against the dash as one of the rear wheels 
&gt;    must of locked!      MY question, is there damage to the transmission?
&gt;    I have to take it out anyway, how can I check it out?

&gt;   Hi Eric:
  The syncro trannys are notorious for breaking the housing that supports
the creeper gear bearings. I don't know why, but after the problem you
described there must have been a lot of force put on those bearings/housing.
Maybe it should be checked. I hope it's ok because the housing is several
hundred dollars. Sorry to make you worry. Good luck with it.
