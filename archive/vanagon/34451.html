Subject: I'm gonna sell my Squareback.

Yes, with the impending occasion of one of my busses being back on the 
road soon I have to sell my beloved Squareback because I have much too 
many cars.  Here's the deal.

1973 Volkswagen Type III Squareback, yellow, original luggage rack, 4 speed, 
fuel injected, air-conditioned (yup!), totally stock.  The heads were 
rebuilt about 2 years ago.  The engine was out last year for new oil 
seal/oil cooler seals general tightening of everything as well as a new 
clutch etc.  Problems-needs a new muffler soon (small holes at the side 
seams) and the body has a couple of rusty spots as well as the floors but 
it has never been hit.  This car is very dependable, it always starts 
right up on the first click of the starter, it doesn't leak or smoke 
anything, I really don't want to part with it.  Oh yeah, I don't know the 
mileage because the odometer stopped moving regularly 2000mi after I 
bought it.  It says 78,000 for what it's worth.  I live on Long Island 
(NY) if anyone's interested, please E-mail to my address.  I'm asking for 
about $800.  It's called Samovar (because it sounds like a chugging 
russian teapot).

Thanks.
	Erik
