&gt; So, do we know it is OK to remove that thang? Doesn't it provide some sort
&gt; of structural support, or is it a useless evolutionary remnant?

All the '78 or '79 I've seen with the Vanagon style seats simply
looked like it was never put in at all with no other changes so I
say it does nothing for the body structure, my only question though is
the floor sufficient to support a self supporting seat, I know our
drivers seat doesn't touch the metal wall, but in a collision it would
be there for impact resistance, does anyone with a real late Bus know if
the seat mount area got reinforced upon the fitment of the later seats?
In fact did it maybe become flat like a Vanagon? with a piece welded
over the little dip down area? I looked at one a few years back but
can't remember.
