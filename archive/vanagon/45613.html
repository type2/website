Subject: Road Trip Alert! Keep your eyes peeled! 


My cousin, who is moving from jacksonville FL to seattle WA, will be 
taking the long way, and seeeing the parts of the country he didnt see 
when he took his motorcycle trip in '86. So, keep your eyes peeled for a 
'85 Vanagon GL, silvergrey, with tinted windows, and two kids: both 
female and around 4 and 2, both blonde. 

Please, if you see them stuck, STOP!:) or if you see them moving, then 
wave, and honk!:)


thanks again...
