Subject: VW Computer Graphics?

Does anyone have, or know where to obtain, VW graphics of any kind?

I'd be interested in anything from line art to BMP's, GIF's, etc., portraying
the various VW models, logos, insignia, and such.  So far, I have only found
scant material on AOL, CIS, etc.

Maybe there's a library out there someone knows about, or software pkg or
even personal collection.

Thanks/Ken Wiebe
