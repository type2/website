Subject:      Someone needed a KEP contact?

Hi All,

The first week of August I read a reply by 'Sean' to 'Tim's' post about
wanting a contact for Kennedy Engineering (this is when Gerry went down
and I was not able to find out who Tim is before went on our vacation.
Anyway, I work across the runway from KEP and am a couple of miles from
their business on my way home everyday.  Tim wanted some pictures and
wanted to ask some them some questions, but the phone calls were getting
expensive.  Tim, if you're out there--let me know what it is you wanted
and I'll try to get it for you.

Let me know,

Garth
