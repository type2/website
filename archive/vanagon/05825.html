Subject: Re: replace FI with carbs?

	The VW-Porsche 914 had the same Type 4 motor as the later
bay-window busses. An outfit called Automobile Atlanta sells all
parts, new and used, to keep 914s on the road- they're a bit
crazy, but nice people. Their parts catalog does offer carb
conversions for high performance, but offers the following technical
advice on the same page:

	Automobile Atlanta Tech Tip 47
Do not carburate your 914 unless you want the following:
1: Poor gas milage
2: Rich running in town, lean running on the interstate.
3: Poor acceleration.
4: Poor cold and hot starting.
5: A butchered engine compartment
6: A lot of noise
7: Oil spray all over the engine compartment
8: A worn out engine twice as fast
9: A 914 worth thousands less.

	Automobile Atlanta Tech Tip 48

Fuel injection is a precisely metered, failsafe system that has few component
failures. The newest Porsches use a system very similar to the 914 (read Type 4).
Fuel injection will give you the best performance and fuel economy on a stock
914 engine. Do NOT remove it!

		--------======== + + + ========-------

	They also observe that the fuel injection system is vacuum regulated,
and good hoses, a secure oil-filler O ring, etc, are crucial to continued
good Fuel Injection operation. Particularly the 1.8 liter with the L-Jetronic
system. (1.7 and 2.0 have D-Jet).
