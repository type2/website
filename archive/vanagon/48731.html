you who tried to help. Basically, my Vanagon has an intermitent engine
&gt;failure that started as a momentary hesitation and now most consitently
&gt;reveals itself as difficulty in restarting after a short drive (3-4mi) and
&gt;followed by a short stop (5-30min). Often the car will crank over but
&gt;gives no indication of wanting to fire. After trying several times over 5
but I have had a return of the symptom. Once was in my driveway and I was
&gt;able to effect a cure by again disconecting and reconnecting that
&gt;connector. Tugging at the wires does not seem to cause any engine
&gt;problems.
&gt;
&gt;So, I would have to conclude that the problem lies somewhere in the
&gt;circuitry involving that connector. Anyone have an idea what could be
&gt;wrong?

The (*bloody*) pins in every connector anywhere on the Bus (&amp; on all other
vehicles that I'm aware of) are swaged onto the wire, but never soldered.
Works for 100k miles or the extent of the warranty, whichever is shorter,
but for various obvious physical reasons they have a tendency to loosen &amp;
either cause an increase in resistance, or outright failure.  Remove the
pins from the connector housing, re-crimp, apply some paste flux and solder
(if you're a *really* tweaky type, use 5% silver solder - cheap &amp; will still
be conducting when the rest of the vehicle is long gone)

(BTW, sometimes those pins were never seated properly in the housing in the
first place - it'll drive you nuts trying to track down an intermittant
caused by this)
