Subject: replacement  body panels (long)

Thought I'd post a brief report on the condition of our latest
resto.  Not so much `cause I suspect everyones particularly
interested in what we're doing, but more as an opinion towards
the care and feeding of your personal rust demon..

BACK STORY

Fellow Listmember Richard (where's the stickers) Palmer and I
swapped our projects mid-stream (his 66 21 window for my 65
single-cab) last summer. Richard I believe now has &quot;Lemonhead&quot;
for sale, and I've contracted with a client down here to sell
&quot;Claire&quot; as a restored Deluxe.

&quot;Claire&quot; was what we call soft.  By that I mean she had lots of
soft spongy areas on her body, especially around all those lovely
opera windows.  The front floorpans on both drivers and passengers
sides were completely gone as was the outside two feet of the cargo
bed again on the passenger side. Her nose was crushed so hard it had
crimped the heater vent (angel wings) in two and rippled what was
left of the passenger floorpan.

The rest of the body was relatively unscathed. Doors were solid but
for a few holes ripped out of the side skin where at one time it
appears there were west-coast mirrors attached, and on the back hatch, 
where a half dozen or so 3/8&quot; holes had been left!

BODY CHECKLIST
-----------------------------------
Need nose and windsheild frames
Need Floorpan(s) up front
Need Floorpan cargo area pass side
Need Rockerpanel drivers side
Need rear quarterpanel drivers side

Fabricate replacement opera window frames -can't find a source!
Fabricate and patch drivers fender well holes
Fabricate and repair passengers seat frame (had been butchered)
Spot weld/patch holes in roof where plexi sunroof had been installed

NOSE/FRONTEND

On the nose we opted (after numerous suggestions) to hammer and dolly
the metal back into condition -vs- skin graft. After seeing what was
available in the aftermarket (cheap stamped 20gauge with headlight
shells you could push in with your thumb) and after removing the skin
from a donor nose Richard had given me (only a bazillion spot welds)
the decision was obvious. *A trivia question for the list...
   1. How many individual contours exist on the nose section of a 
						pre-68 micro-bus? hint... The english alphabet has the same
      amount of letters!

Floorpans were originally ordered from Wolfsburg West, but they back-
ordered them on us, so we went to another source, Mill Supply.   Mill
Supply is a source for aftermarket replacement panels/parts specific
to the collision repair industry.  I've dealt with them off-n-on for
a few years and for the most part have been pleased with the quality
of their panels.  Unfortunately, early bus stuff doesn't seem to be
a major concern for them as they list 20 mebbe 25 pieces total for
our dear split window busses. They carry a selection of 68-79 bus
panels and even a few Vanagon parts like lower door skins, wheel arch,
and even the rear butt panel.. They have lots of beetle stuff and seem
to be the supplier to alot of the beetle mail-order catalogs as we've
seen their parts numbers in lots of other catalogs.

   Rocker panel: The panel that runs from the body line at the bottom
   of the bus, and extends from the seam diectly behind the front
   fender/wheel well and reaches to the rear fender/wheel well front
   curve. Mill lists their panel as being 8&quot; high..It was, but it was
   also 1.5 inches short on the length. In Claires case the rot was in
   exactly the area the missing 1.5 inches didn't cover.  Luckily, we
   didn't need to extend the full length of the panel, so's we chopped
   a suitable section only to find the contour didn't match either.  
   To add insult to injury, most replacement panels that don't replace
   an entire section usually come &quot;flanged&quot;. Flanging is a process of
   building a lip or shelf on the replacement panel so's to facilitate
   a butt-weld -vs- an overlapping panel.  Our panel came plainjane...

   Floorpan:  The outside cargo area floor pan is a complex series of
   reenforcements with drip hole guides, reverse skirt bends and two
   precisely positioned guide plates. The critical plate is the one
   which the double-doors lock down in with the handle shafts. This
   plate covers 2 square metal &quot;cups&quot; which hold the handleshafts in
   place. Beyond this plate is an overrlapping tab running the length
   of the panel which should bend over to form the shelf under which
   your expensive West Coast Metric door seals fit.  The other plate
   is the plate used by the full-length middle fold down seat. It acts
   as a floorpan stiffener and saddle for the 2 moon-headed bolts that
   clamp the out seatframe bar to the floor.
   Our opinion is that the manufacturer of this panel (May or may not
   have been Mill Supply) pulled the mold off an existing panel, not
   by factory dimensions.  Our rational is that the overall specs on
   the critical areas I've discussed above seem to be 1/16&quot; off on all
   directions. The ribbing doesn't match, and the door lockdowns are
   so far off as to require us to grind off the new plate and fab one
   of the proper dimensions and reposition it once the doors are put
   back on after paint...

   REAR Quarter panel:
   The fit on this piece was factory close..Danish supplier for these
   (Mill obviously deals with numerous suppliers) as was stamped into
   the inside of the panel. Came complete with shelf lip for battery
   tray (not included) and id marks for placement of taillight/reverse
   light.  we had this peice on in under 20 minutes..Boy, if only it
   all could have been this easy...

MORAL

   It is impossible to tell quality of a body panel from linedrawings!
   Know your UPS driver well, offer him/her a cup of Joe and a donut
   while you inspect any shipment of which you have had no previous
   experiance. In our opinion you really get what you pay for. We have
   had the priveledge of working on restorations using entirely NOS
   bodypanels and can tell you upfront that if at all feasible look at
   the savings account hard before you start pinching those resto
   pennies.  Even though floor pans go unseen, the effort spent in
   trying to make cheaply made parts fit properly can easily outweigh
   the additional cost of returning ill-fitting panels and ordering
   quality stuff from a reputable supplier... Ask around at the local
   paint and body shops for possible sources. Most shops &quot;Flatrate&quot;
   their repairs and cannot afford to waste time on ill-fitting parts.
   Ask fellow listfolk as we are an invaluable source that isn't    
   limited to a specific geographic locale.
