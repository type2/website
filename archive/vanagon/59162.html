Late model Vanagon Westies didn't have any cupholders, which I think is
too bad. I just installed a couple of the retractable ones, adjustable
for different cup sizes, black hard plastic and metal, nice quality.
Bought them _at_ GI Joe's for around $5.00 each. Nameco brand.
A fellow list member suggested a really good spot for them; the carpeted
wall between front seats, passenger side. They are accesible for both
the driver and passenger, and are not in the way in case one wants to
swivel the seat facing back. The other possible location, at the heater
outlet under dash, was not appealing because it wasn't very sturdy
(required drilling into plastic) and because being right in the way of
the heated air outlet, it would warm up any drink that one might be
trying to keep cold.
Four small drilled holes through the carpet did the job.The nice thing
is that if I ever want to take the cupholders out, the carpet covers
these holes, and you can't tell they are there.
