Subject: the bodega area


Of general interest - information on the Bodega Dunes location, which is
part of the Sonoma Coast State Beach -

Sonoma Coast STate Beach is actually a series of beaches that extend
18 miles from Bodega Head to Sonoma Coast Vista Trail, 4 miles north of
Jenner.

Some popular activities enjoyed by visitors include fishing, whale 
watching, bird watching, tide pooling, beach combing, picnicking,
hiking, and horseback riding.

Note of caution:  Like most North Coast beaches, the Sonoma Coast
is not for swimming.  Cold water, strong rip currents, backwash
and large, unpredictable &quot;sleeper&quot; waves have caused many deaths.  
These conditions make surf, play or climbing on nearby rock out-croppings
dangerous and unsafe.

Two environmental hike-in campgrounds are incidentally nearby:  Willow
Creek and Pomo Canyon.  As a reminder, reservations for camping are made thru
MISTIX at 1.800.444.7275.  Our particular campground is called
Bodega Dunes.  

Other notes:  dogs are not permitted in the environmental campgrounds.
Dogs are permitted at Bodega Dunes provided fees are paid, and that they
are kept on a leash, off the trails, and never unattended.
No gathering of wood is permitted.  Fire wood is available for sale
at camp-host sites.
Check out time is 12 noon
Quiet hours are 10 p.m. - 6 a.m. (obviously this campground has never
seen the likes of us from the vanagon group :)
Maximum number of people per sie is 8.
All vehicles must be parked on the paved campsite spur or in the
overflow lot.  Two motor vehicles per site.
Fires are allowed in the fire rings; you may use your camp stove.
Swimming or wading in the nearby Russian River is not recommended.  The
river is treacherour due to submerged obstacles, uneven bottom, and
unpredictable current; no lifeguards.
