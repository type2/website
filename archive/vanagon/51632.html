Subject: CCC's January update

The favored destination seems to be:  Tahoe

I'm working on getting us a place to rent.  Mind you, I'll try to
keep this as economical as possible, but it will definitely cost
more than camping per person.  Will have more on this soon.  If
anyone receiving this happens to know of places, let me know.  

--

If there's any changes in the following, please let me know ASAP,
as our final head count determines not only the price per person,
but what size place we need to be looking for.

Kathy Myers/Mark Blanchard
Coyote Ron Lussier and Dan
Jack Stafford
Bradley Prunehead
Sam/Susie Williams
Bren Smith &amp; family
Marcus Doherr and family
Dave Kautz and family
Harvey Chao and family
Eugene Palmer
me, etc.
Jeff Schneiter
SGREENAWALT_at_SCUACC.SCU.EDU (name?)
Wagners?
Holsers?
Johnsons? (didnUt hear from you, but put ya down anyway, cuz I
             wanna have pigs in blankets as appetizers  :)

--

As I say, please let me know if this is NOT correct above with
the roster, and let me know pronto.  Thanx.

For those of you catching this for the first time, this is not
a campout in our traditional sense, but we're trying out a new
suggestion to rent a place up in the snow (by popular demand),
where we can all converge and sit around the fireplace.  Because
we'll be inside, it's doubtful we'll be blowing anything up.  AT
least not intentionally.  :)  Anyway, because there may be quite
a few of us, and no place we can get for ourselves will have
enuff bedrooms, I guess we can all bring up bedding, and sack
out in a big slumber party, etc.  Or draw straws.  Whatever.
