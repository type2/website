I couldn't disagree more.  I think that people who keep cars in museums
should get to live in the museums along with their cars.  One shouldn't
have to worry about driving a car around, or leaving it outside, unless
the weather is a danger to the condition of the car.  I doubt that was
the case here.  Cars are meant to be driven and appreciated, not stored 
in locked rooms.
