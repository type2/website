Bill writes jump-start how-to guilde:
&gt; 
&gt; 	3) A proper jump means several things, done correctly:
&gt; 	3.1) The recipiant battery needs to have correct electrolyte level,
&gt; 		be clean, well connected, etc.
&gt; 	3.2) Connect negative to negative first, at the battery terminals.
&gt; 	3.3) Start the donor car, if it is not already running and 
&gt; 		get it idling.
&gt; 	3.4) Connect the postive termnials, battery to battery, 
&gt; 	3.5) WAIT. Let the donor charge-up the recipiant's battery for a while.
&gt; 	3.6) After five minutes or so, try starting the recipiant.
&gt; 	3.7) Recipiant won't crank? WAIT another 5 minutes. 
&gt; 	3.8) If the recipiant still won't crank, try running the donor up
&gt; 		to 2500 or 3000 rpm for a minute, and try again.
&gt; 	3.9) If this doens't do it, you need more than a jump start.
&gt; 
&gt; 	OF COURSE, your milage may vary. 

I assume the Diesel owners in the audience are getting a chuckle from the 
above.  With a diesel, you need those 00 gage jumper cables, with a donor
whose amp can put out serious power.  While a poor student, in sub-zero
(fahrenheit) weather, when the old jump-start routine got too old, I invested
in a tow-rope, and had the neighbor tow me a few blocks to get the old
oil-burner chugging.  300K on an engine tends to make it a hard starter
on those cool mornings.
