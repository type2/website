&gt; I have been looking for some after market items to dress out
&gt; the Vanagon engine compartment, ie crome valve covers and any other
&gt; dress-ups

Wow, I thought that chrome valve covers for these were available everywhere.
You must live on the moon.  The waterboxer Vanagons use old Beetle valve
covers, available in chrome or aluminum...

The other best ways to dress the compartment are to replace the fuel lines
with stainless braided AN hoses, and paint the intake runners and plenum.

Colorful spark-plug wires are easy, too.
