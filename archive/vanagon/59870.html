Subject: refrigerant update...

Today's learning included a semantics lesson - the &quot;bad&quot; hoses that leak
the smaller-molecule refrigerants are &quot;nitrile&quot; material and the common
name for the &quot;good&quot; hoses is &quot;barrier hose&quot;.  One of the sites stated that
the &quot;barrier hose&quot; is nylon-lined.

If anyone can tell me whether the '90 Vanagon with factory A/C has
&quot;nitrile&quot; rubber hoses, I'd appreciate it.

My VW guru claims that he knows where to have new hoses made, so that I
should be able to get a complete set of A/C hoses for $200, instead of
likely paying that much for just the high-side hose from the dealer.  He
really doesn't like working for a dealer again - it bugs him to overcharge
as much as they do.

I did find the Houston-local shop for R406A and R414A (and FrigC) coolant.
The owner tried to talk me into getting the entire system changed over
(which I find less than encouraging).  He said if I was going to change the
coolant why not do it right - or why not just get a load of R12?
 He implied that he'd likely have to drop the overhead unit...  I just want
the thing charged up and working.  No one's been able to find the six-month
leak yet and I'm not about to buy a completely new A/C system to try and
guarantee that there's no leak. (Not that that would be any guarantee.)
These people just want to suck as much money out of me as they can.  I'm
tempted to just get the R12 and see what happens (but I haven't priced R12
in several months and it's probably beyond ridiculous now...).

Whatever - the A/C shop wants $48 to do a leak check.  Which doesn't sound
unreasonable.  What says the list?
