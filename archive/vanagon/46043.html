&gt;Yesterday while riding my motorcycle I spotted a vanagon with 4 round
&gt;headlights. I have never seen this arrangment before and was wondering
&gt;if it was some kind of option or was it just someone's idea of
&gt;customizing their VW.

there were some custom shops in Germany (Project Tzwo comes to mind; also
Oettinger) that made a grill for four headlights. but also the South African
models for a while had four headlights ... the inner two being driving lights
(to see those lions in the road up ahead!!).

unfortunately, it was never a VW-offered option in Europe or North America.
:(  ... anybody wanna make a parts-trip to South Africa??? :)
