Thanks Joel,

I forgot to mention that I did check for vacuum leaks, the only piece of
rubber hose is about 2 inches long at the end of a long hard plastic
tube on the front side of the manifold.   I wish it were that easy.

I just came back from resetting the timing back to where it belongs and
noticed that when I started up with the temp II disconected it ran
fine.  The temp sensor tested out fine with an ohm meter though.  Is
there a way to double check it?

&gt; try checking out the vacuum hoses ... one of them might be cracked. the
&gt; crack will sometimes close up as the engine warms up, sealing the leak
&gt; and making everything run ok. especially check the rubber elbow attached
&gt; to the Air Flow Meter.
&gt;
&gt; good luck!
