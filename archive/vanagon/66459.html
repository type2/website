Subject:      Re: Vanagon BRA caution

&gt; I have an '88 Vanagon with a bra who's mesh extends over the high-beam
&gt; headlights. I though, no problem, I'll have a friend who can sew -
correct
&gt; the mesh so that the headlights are uncovered.
&gt;
&gt; Well, be aware that doing this, uncovering the headlights, makes that
part
&gt; of the bra act like an air scoop - and causes the bra to flap on the
front
&gt; of the Vanagon. I have not determined if adjusting the retaining straps
&gt; will remedy the problem. But please be aware that this may be a problem
if
&gt; you plan to adjust the mesh over the headlights.

The bras I sell come from the factory with no mesh over the headlights
(just over the radiator grill), yet they do not exhibit the flapping
problem that you describe. These are not aftermarket bras, but are genuine
Volkswagen bras (with &quot;Vanagon&quot; embroidered on them in white), and run
$99.95.
