Subject: fit stereo in dash, 83.5 Westy?

Hello-

Next snag. I just spoke with Crutchfield, the car stereo people, and found
out there is limited space in the Vanagon dash for audio equipment. They list
the depth ot the hole in the dash at 6 1/4&quot; while most stereos are 6 1/2&quot; to
6 3/4&quot; deep.

Has anyone fit a deeper unit than the 6 1/4&quot; in the dash. I've got an
aftermarket Sony in there now which is exactly 6 1/4&quot; deep and it butts up
against a bracket in the back (which is actually the front of the vehicle). I
want to upgrade the system to one with a detachable face for anti-theft
protection. Is there a trick to getting a deeper unit in? Or does anyone know
of a detachable face CD unit that fits?

TYIA
