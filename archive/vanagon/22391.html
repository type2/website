Subject: Re: Jerry Garcia, Dead, and VWs



Hey, with this Internet thingie, we could probably have one organized by
say...tomorrow at 5:00.

Call it &quot;VWs for Jerry&quot; or something. We could send e-mail to NBC.COM,
CBS.COM, and CNN.COM (don't know the real addresses, but I could find
them). By tomorrow afternoon, they'd be doing their internet-saavy thing
telling everyone how cool they are to know about this VWs for Jerry caravan
that starts in ? and goes to ? (they'd have to be relevant locations...like
from Woodstock to the Arch to San Francisco).

The idea could work like hands across america (only vans across america)
...anyone with a VW bus please drive along this route on Saturday to show
your respect for Jerry...anyone without a bus, please drive with your
lights on and flash peace signs at the people driving the buses.

We'd have to have someone willing to start at Woodstock (or wherever) and
someone willing to finish up (wherever) to make the national news again,
but it might be cool.

Hey, it's just an idea, but then, so was that band until Jerry came
along...now, what was that called again? ...and How DID they get that name?

Thanks! Joe


&gt;&gt;          Well, just heard the news that Jerry Garcia passed away this
&gt;&gt;          morning...I can't say that I was every a big GD fan, but its
&gt;&gt;          sad nonetheless...do you think all the roadies and deadheads
&gt;&gt;          out there will have a coast to coast caravan of VWs in his
&gt;&gt;          honor...maybe...maybe???
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;          Kind of surprising news, though...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;          just thought I'd pass that on...
