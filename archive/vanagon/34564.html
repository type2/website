Subject: RE: how 2 block fuel lines ?


     I'm looking for an alternative to pencils for blocking the lines.  I'm
     not going to try plastic pens though.  It anyone has experience here
     I'd love to hear about it.

My larger Phillips screwdriver fits just fine.

And, I have a tapered round center punch made of a single piece of
steel-- closest thing to a one-size-fits-all hose plug you can get.

Why on earth did you use a pencil?
