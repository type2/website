Subject: Re: silver socket and collapsible spare tire

&gt; 
&gt; lemme see if i get this right:
&gt; 
&gt; - the sockets are only on 80, 81, and 82 campers.
&gt; - those year campers came with a collapsible spare tire???
&gt; 
  My '74 has a silver socket. Westfalia put a collapsable spare tire in the
  bottom of the cabinet with the sink in it &lt;left side&gt; since they used the
  spare tire well for the closet for items on hangers. I'm assuming that
  Westfalia fitted the silver socket since it is their manual that shows it
  being used to power the compressor &lt;to fill the tire, to fix the flat, to
  get to the house that Jack built....&gt;. That means that it isn't just 80-82
  campers that have it. I think '75s also had the collapsable spare, maybe 
  they have a silver socket too? Sami, are you listening?


  BTW Gerry, soluble was in the question I asked him - my choice of words,
  not his. You are probably right, he is a real quiet guy and not the type
  to correct the terminology of a windbag like me.
