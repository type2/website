Subject: re:  Recommendation on Slick 50



&gt;   When I turned round a corner ina little town in  the mountains of Idaho
&gt;and saw a much neglected looking blue barndoor for sale I went nutso.  My
&gt;boyfriend and I waited around all day for the owner to show up and made a
&gt;deal to come back and get  it.  The bus had been a grain storage shed on a
&gt;farm for probably 20 years and reeked of mouse piss.  They had taken all 
the
&gt;stuffing from the front seat and made a nest in he space under the seat.
&gt;
&gt;   So, two months later  we show up with a set of tires,  an engine, a pile
&gt;of tools,  a complete set of brake cylinders and hoses, battery, and a
&gt;welding machine to fix the broken throw-out arm on the transmission (on a
&gt;split-case you have to take the trans out and apart to replace the arm - 
this
&gt;was not in the program as we had to be back home after the weekend)
&gt;
&gt;     So after 2 1/2 days hard work, no shower or flush toilet,  The beast 
is
&gt;fired up, much to the amazement of the guy we got it from,   and actually
&gt;drove, stopped and had lights, semaphores etc. but no wipers.
&gt;
&gt;  anyway, the point is that the transmission was loud and hard to shift. 
 We
&gt;drove it 500 miles home,  switched the 1600 back into the 61,  and put a 
36hp
&gt;in the 54.



And we only get one single-page post describing the adventure?  :^)
