Subject: Re: I WANT LIST STICKER

Mr. Jimmy (like in Cant Always Get What You Want?) asks:

&gt;Is a &quot;list sticker&quot; like a &quot;pot sticker&quot;?

Yep, the list sticker is a picture of a cluster of 5 cannibis 
leaves..emblazoned across the leaves is &quot;V W  V A N  L I S T&quot;...
around the leaves sort of in a large circle is our motto...
&quot;Our vans may be pokin'... our engines smokin'....but we're up front tokin'&quot;

Much more kewel than a BLUNT insignia wouldn't you say?
