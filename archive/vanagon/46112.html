Subject: Re: Further adventures of Ras Bulli Split [Part the fourth].


&gt;Today's little treat was the &quot;horn which hasn't worked since I have
&gt;had the Bus.  I was planning to pull the horn off the Thing for the
&gt;purpose of passing this year's inspection and in the process of
&gt;removing the old bus horn decided to blow it out with the compressor
&gt;just &quot;to see&quot;.  I then hooked it to the pos. terminal of the batter
&gt;and intermittently grounded the other terminal...after a few
&gt;&quot;clickity-clicks&quot;, my head was almost taken off by a sound that could
&gt;nearest be described as a 'moose in rutting season'.  Hey, inspection
&gt;doesn't require that the horn be &quot;polite&quot;, just that it make
&gt;sufficient noise...and that it does!  So, for the first time, Ras
&gt;Split has a fully functioning horn :-)
&gt;

Excellent! My bus has a dual air horn put on by a PO. It puts out 120
decibels, easily. It definitely gets people's attention, although I worry
that someone will be so surprised that they will run off the road after
they pull out in front of me.

&gt;Inspection is the end of the month and provided that &quot;they&quot; do not
&gt;insist on seat-belts, we will be ready...more or less.
&gt;

I put shoulder belts in my '66 Bus. I salvaged them from a '72 or '73, and
attached it where the coat hanger on the pillar used to be. I feel a little
safer that way, especially after reading Muir's description of how driving
a bus is like being an aztec god strapped to the front (or something like
that).

&gt;However, there are a few things that are needed before I can do any
&gt;amount of 'transporting':
&gt;
&gt;1)  New seals for headlight and front turnsignal assemblies...I also
&gt;need those little rubber &quot;nibs&quot; that go inside the headlight
&gt;assemblies to cushion the sealed beam and adjusters.  I was hoping to
&gt;put this off until after the body work and painting was done...but I
&gt;am growing tired of draining the headlights after every rain...plus I
&gt;do not need anymore rust...I already have my share.

WCM has the headlight seals, but I don't think they have the turn signal
seals. I've toyed with the idea of using 1/4&quot; rubber tubing instead. It
would do the same job, and look ok, too, if you hid the ends somehow.

&gt;4)  New engine seal gasket [whatever it is called].  This is the big
&gt;gasket that goes between the engine tin and the floor of the engine
&gt;compartment to keep all that nasty hot air out.
&gt;
I got one from a salvage yard. Maybe 69-71 seals would work, too. 

&gt;5)  Air-cleaner and duct that attaches to the carb. --trust I, these
&gt;things do not bounce very well, no enjoy falling off the back of a
&gt;truck :-(...

My PO had an EMPI air filter that sat directly on top of the carb. He said
it improved performance, but I wanted to pass the smog test, so I hooked up
my oil bath filter. Still have the EMPI filter if you are interested in it.

&gt;
&gt;6)  Sun visors and mounting brackets...PO had removed the originals to
&gt;put in another Bus.
&gt;

A VW salvage yard in Vista, CA has them for $11-$14, depending on its
condition. I don't know their name offhand, but I could find out about it.

&gt;8)  windshield washer bottle and pump  .... anyone want to part with
&gt;one of these?
&gt;
Get me one, too. ;
)
&gt;9)  I need the rubber seals that go where the clutch/brake/accelerator
&gt;pedals come through the floor of the van...the local VW dealer
&gt;couldn't find them...does anyone still make these?
&gt;
I got these from WCM. The brake and clutch seals are VW parts, but the
accelerator seal is repro. They are less than $5.

Good luck.
