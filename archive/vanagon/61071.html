Your resistor , red red black white - is probably actually red red black =
silver, in which case it is 22 ohms, 10% tolerance.  An easy way to =
remember the resistor color code is this  ancient and modestly off color =
ditty - 

bad =3D black=3D 0
boys =3D brown =3D 1
rape =3D red =3D 2
our  =3D orange =3D 3
young =3D yellow =3D 4
girls =3D green =3D 5
but =3D blue =3D 6
violet =3D purple =3D 7
gives =3D green =3D 8
willingly =3D white =3D 9

You have to additionally remember that silver is 10% tolerance, gold 5% =
tolerance.

The color code is arranged left to right so that the most significant =
digit is at the left edge of the resistor, followed by least significant =
digit, then multiplier, and then tolerance band.

I just went outside (0940AM) and measured the resistance of the temp =
sender.  Current ambient temp is 75 deg. F, overnight low was probably 58 =
degrees or so, and the resistance was about 1140 ohms WITH THE LEAD TO =
THE SENDER DISCONNECTED.  


Hope this helps
Harvey
