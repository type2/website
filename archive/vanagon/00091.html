Technical Information
Group 87, Number 89-01, August 31, 1989
Model(s): Vanagon with A/C, model years 1986-1989
Subject:  Evaporator Housing - change

Starting April 1988, a running change was made to the evaporator housing and
introduced into production.

To prevent cracking, the body attachment points have been relocated.

Evaporator housings are now available through the parts depot and come as a
multiple supersession with the following items:
  1 evaporator housing (color coded)
  2 mounting brackets
  2 shims (color coded)
  6 rivets
  6 body plugs (color coded)
  6 bolts

INSTALLING
- disconnect battery
- remove front A/C control assembly and center vents
- remove both rear side covers at C-pillars
- remove both outside vent covers
- remove relay assembly from left C-pillar adn all tie wraps holding A/C lines
- remove evaporator housing fasteners and lower housing

NOTE
Discharging the A/C system is NOT required due to the length of the evaporator
hoses.  A cherry picker with a protective cover helps in lowering the
evaporator housing.

- bolt brackets to new evaporator housing and lift into postion
- with the evaporator firmly positioned against the roof, work through the
  speaker holes, mark location of new bracket attachment points approximately
  40 mm (1.575 in.) above the original holes
- lower evaporator housing, center punch and drill holes to accomodate rivets

NOTE
Rivets can be installed using Kent-Moore tool #M-39010

- install original covers on bolt heads
- install remaining components
