&gt;After changing carbs, coil, vacuum advance, cap and rotor, my motor
&gt;STILL is running badly.  When driving, it seems like all electrical power
&gt;stops for a second, then picks up again.  It acts like it is missing, it
&gt;stumbles pretty bad even at steady speeds, then runs fine for a minute or
&gt;two.  I am lost about the cause.   It is frustrating because it is
&gt;very intermitent and at idle it runs fine.  I thought maybe the coil wire
&gt;had grounded agains the block, but all the wires look fine.
&gt;
If it seems like the key was momentarily turned off, I think I'd try running
a wire straight from the battery to the + side of the coil.  Don't leave it
hooked up too long without the engine running as it would overheat the coil
and possibly damage the points.  If this fixes things I'd look at the
ignition switch, etc.  The only other thing I can think of offhand is maybe
something inside the dist. being worn or not making connection, or the point
wire shorting to ground.  Have you checked the point gap/dwell angle, and
condition of the points?  Also, it wouldn't hurt to check for vacuum leaks,
just to rule them out even if it's not your &quot;main&quot; problem.  You don't by
chance have an electric fuel pump, do you?  That could be cutting in and out,
too.
