Subject: Re: Flaky fuel gauge

Hi,
I had a problem with my gauge a while back, never registered more than half full.
I think it was a post from Andy Erskine that suggested having a look at the gauge itself,
there is a coilish bit of wire in the gauge, this was encrusted with I don't know what.
But after a quick gentle brush I put the gauge back in the dash and lo, it worked fine.
Bizarre, I never did understand black magic.

&gt;Hello all!
&gt;My '75 Westy has a sick fuel gauge - it never registers more than 1/2 a tank
&gt;and I can bottom out on &quot;reserve&quot;and still have half a tank left... obviously
&gt;this makes for high tension on any lengthy road trips!  Also, I can watch the
&gt;needle fluctuate from 1/2 to 1/4 to &quot;R&quot; and back - it doesn't matter whether
&gt;I'm on level ground, uphill, downhill, accelerating or decelerating - that
&gt;needle jumps all over da place!  Now I suppose that it's the float thingy
&gt;inside the gas tank which is to blame, but I'm posting this in the hope that
&gt;there's a way to determine what the problem is *without* dropping the engine
&gt;to remove the tank for inspection/cleaning/whatever... 
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas out there?  Or must I remain  &quot;Have gas can, Will travel&quot;?
