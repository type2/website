Subject: RE: WTD: Brown Carpet Set for Vanagon

JChristensen is looking for brown vgon carpeting; says his is beyond a good
cleaning.  I just want to say don't underestimate what you can do by taking
the carpet out of the van, soaking it with the hose, sudsing it well with
a scrub brush, rinsing it well and hanging it up to dry on the line for
two-three days.  *Amazing* quantities of dirt come out, and the carpeting
ends up fluffy, sweetsmelling, and a half-shade lighter.  I've done this
for an 81 and an 84, and the carpet backing seems not to mind being soaked
at all.  A whole different level of clean than you can do with the carpet
in the car.
