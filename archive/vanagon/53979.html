Don,

Regarding your scary message about the main coolant tank and the recovery tank
raises a question for me.  How can I tell if the cap on my main coolant tank is
working properly.  I understand it is supposed to release coolant into the
recovery tank when pressure exceeds a certain limit (what is that I don't know),
and then draw it back in when pressure drops below a threshold pressure (don't
know that either).  Is there a simple way to test this cap.  Like blowing or
sucking on it from the front or backside?

Charles
