&gt; Turns out the clutch master is nearly gone.  I have to have
&gt; this replaced.  My mechanic who I've always trused (but now
&gt; I have this group filled with many more knowledgable people)
&gt; also found the slave cylinder 'wet'.  He said the slave could
&gt; wait but it's just a matter of time.  Does all of this sound
&gt; about right?  Oh yeah, the killer stuff - parts &amp; labor $450.00.

Is that $450 for replacing just the clutch master?  Mine was leaking
and I rebuilt it for less than $20 and that includes the brake fluid!
I believe a new master was around $130.  I never priced labor to replace.
