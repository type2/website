Thom,
Speaking of &quot;the evil&quot;, which sounds awfully like &quot;devil&quot;, wanna do a:


 while(&lt;&gt;){
	if ($_ =~ /microsoft/ ) {print $_;}
 }

on your wonderful file of deep thoughts???? :-)

while you're at it, you might as well do a:

 while(&lt;&gt;){
	if ($_ =~ /lawyer/ ) {print $_;}
 }

and count up the results maybe ???
