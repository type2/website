Subject: VW issue Vanagon floor mats $10.00


All,

I was in Young VW in Easton,  PA this weekend and lo-and-behold
sitting in a corner were five sets of VW issue floor mats [front]
with the Vanagon name across the high wear area for $10.00  a set.
The number there is 610-253-6244,  the parts guy is ok for a parts
guy,  I'm pretty they will send them to you.  If not,  stop by,  I
think thursday is their late night,  they are only open 'til 11:00
am on saturday.
