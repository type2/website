Subject: Re: Vanagon Heat

&gt;Isn't the smoke visible proof that the heater tubes are in good shape?
&gt;Even at full speed,the air flow was more like seeping. Shoud it resemble the
&gt;force of the fresh air which is quite strong?
&gt;
&gt;I've got to go back to my german guru mechanic later this week to pick up
&gt;another car and will of course discuss this with him then. In the meanwhile,
&gt;I'll feel a lot better if someone tells me that I've got a lot more to look
&gt;forward to than this
&gt;

Weston, is the cables to the heater boxes working properly?  If their not
opening the airflow will be crappy. Try opening them and then check
underneath to see if their open all the way, if not, the cables might need
adjusting.  You could do like we here in the northeast do and wire them
open. Most of the time the cables are rusted and don't work. It seems
though smoke will travel anywhere so even if the flaps are only open
alittle you can still get alot of smoke. Speaking of the smoke, are you
leaking any oil from the valve covers, I know you said that everythings new
but you could have a slight leak and I've seen vans smoke only after the
van has stopped.  I thought that the fan in front helped the airflow from
the heater as well as fresh air flow but I could be wrong. I really haven't
have much experience with air-cooled Vanagons. I've always managed to find
a watercooled Vanagon.  Well, thats my two-cents worth. Good luck.
