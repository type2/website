Subject:      Syncro Weekender F/S in Macon, Ga.

Would the person from Macon, Ga. who wants to sell his Syncro Vanagon
Weekender please repost his message.  I accidently erased his posting on
the list.  I'm interested in looking at this vehicle and live only
thirty miles away in Perry, Ga.

                                        Thanks,
                                        John
