Subject:      for admins, sorry to waste bandwidth!

hi all,

I sent a message to vanagon-request_at_gerry.sdsc_dot_edu on monday and have
recieved no reply.  I was attempting to unsubscribe and it has me listed
as not being subscribed from spw_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com.  I probably am
subscribed as spw_at_anet-stl_dot_com.

Did this message not get through or are y'all swamped?  On a message like
this does one normally get a reply or are you just summarily unsubscribed?

It has been nice being here, and i will continue to read the archives
hypermail but since i own an aircooled v'gon all the discussion of the
watercooled ones has goten a bit overwhelming, thus i will look for
support mainly on the type2 list.  Thanks for tolerating my ramblings...

ill probably get tired of having such an empty mailbox and resubscribe
next week ;)

thanks,

Steve
