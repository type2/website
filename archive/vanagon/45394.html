David,

You'll have to excuse me for not putting two and two together. I've read
your posts and I know your daguy with daboat but it just didn't click.
Visited your page, neat.

Just a short follow up on the Safare.. originally, I believe, white over
med-dark blue repainted during the conversion to burgandy with a whole bunch
of typically 70's looking silver stripes. I seen posts about that little bit
of rust under the windshield, this has it. Funny though, the rust buckets
from up north like here in Wi. don't seem to have that problem.I wonder if
it's salty condensation dripping down from the windshield on rigs that live
near the ocean?

In any case it's  a darn nice VW and the hope is that  the person who buys
it will appreciate it and not ruin it. One thing for sure, they'll be head
and shoulders above the crowd  ;) 

See ya on the road
