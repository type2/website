&gt;Did you only remove the trans to change the clutch??  If so, could you
&gt;give a brief overview of the process?
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;Dan: If you have to do a clutch change you might want to make sure the
cross shaft that holds the throw out bearing is in good shape. I was talking
to a VW wrench about a problem I was having with my Syncro ( new clutch and
it still chatters) and he said they were starting to see Vanagons come in
with chatter problems due to the cross shaft pockets(the two pockets that
hold the throw out bearing) being worn more on one side than the other. This
condition holds the throw out bearing crooked and apperently causes chatter.
I havn't checked mine yet, but I need to.
