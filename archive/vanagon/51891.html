&gt;Actually, if you remove the &quot;PRND21&quot; cover from the automatic
&gt;transmission shift console, you'll find two tiny, tiny lamps that
&gt;move with the shifter.
&gt;Mine are also blown out, and I'd sure like to know whether or not they're
&gt;removable, since I'm sorta reluctant to apply overwhelming force to
&gt;these fragile little bulbs without someone telling me that I'm not
&gt;going to &quot;break the transmission&quot; by doing it.

that's likely the same bulbs as in the dash. they are removeable ... you
just pull slowly and carefully (you might have to wiggle them) straight
outward/upward. don't squeeze with any sort of pliers or anything!
