Subject: Re: Need advice:  Trouble after rebuild

&gt; Second, I'm currently
&gt;35 miles from home -- should I call a tow truck, or have I already
&gt;done the damage I'm going to do and just (try to) drive it home?
&gt;
Dave,

I'm no wizard, but I would not drive it if it isn't absolutely necessary.

Could be any number of things.  What did your oil pressure light/gauge say
during all this?  Any smoke?  Are you absolutely sure of your valve
adjustments?  The first thing(s) I would do would be to pull plugs and do a
compression check and go from there.  I know the sick feeling you have right
now first-hand.  Earlier this year, I did a major rebuild of my '70 1600
Type II, did everything just so, only to have to tear it down and do it over
again.

Basically, I  was sold the wrong bearings (oversized) at the local VW parts
place, and was too green to recognize that I had too much play in the
crank/bearings, and could never get sufficient oil pressure.  Fortunately
did not do any damage, as I caught it early and did NOT drive it 'til
something broke.

Good luck.  Hope it's something insignificant.
