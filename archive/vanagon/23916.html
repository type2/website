Subject: RE: VW Vandals, slow painful deaths to...

I had a couple of instances of vandallism to my (RIP) '69 camper. Someone took
a baseball bat to the windshield/driver's side window one evening when it was
parked on the street of a fairly nice (except for this jack*ss) neighborhood.
I was torqued for days until I realized that the vandal(s) did me a favor. I
probably never would have thought to rip my windshield out of its rubber socket
otherwise and I found a load of rust about to burst forth under the seal. I
decided to view the whole thing as a positive experience and set about making
the glass repairs a major project, I got rid of all the rust around the wind-
shield and it never looked so good. I also redid the driver's side window,
replaced all the aged rubber and felt pieces. I felt great as the job was
finished. Van stayed in the driveway from then on...Another time raw eggs were
thrown at my van but that was harmless in comparison.I figured that the
perpetrators were just jealous!!!
