So MERCER BARRY says:
&gt; 
&gt; I have problem with my water developing a &quot;plastic&quot; falavour after just 
&gt; 24 hours in the tank.  Here's the guff:
&gt; 

I'd pour in about a 2 gallons of water, then add about 1/2 gallon of
regular Clorox bleach and then fill about the tank with water.  Drive
the van around to slosh it around in the tank.  Let it sit for about
an hour.  Run the water through the pump/faucet and drain it through
the sink for a few minutes.  Then drain the rest out the bottom of
the tank.  Do this procedure twice more without the bleach and just
use plain water to rinse.
