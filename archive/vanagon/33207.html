&gt;Hello Mark.  You don't say what year your van is, but if it is the 
&gt;painted top (with clearcoat), just wax as normal.  I use carnuba 
&gt;based wax (soon to try Zymol with 35% carnuba content).  It cleans 
&gt;really well, and keeps like new.

&gt;&gt; What's the proper treatment for prolonging the paint on a Westfalia pop
&gt;&gt; top? Should it be waxed with a good carnuba-based auto wax?

Harry, Mark, all - My fiberglass top is not coated, (not counting the corner
of luggage carrier which PO painted with, like, house paint or something..).
 I want to paint/coat it.  The durned *itchy* fiberglass gets all over me
when I scrub the top, as I do each spring, because MOLD grows in the hairline
crevices in the fiberglass, making the top look older and rattier than it
really is! I want something that'll make a nice smoothe coat and last
*forever*, not necessarily white either.. we're painting the Pumpkin this
spring and I may want to co-ordianate w/the paint job.  What have others used
on their fiberglass?
