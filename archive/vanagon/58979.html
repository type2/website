Subject: Vanagon Availability

Are Vanagons really sparse in certain parts of the country?  I've seen lots
of posts when people find Vanagons/EuroVans for sale in their area.  Here in
WA we don't seem to have a shortage of them, I could leave my house right now
and drive no more than 60 min. away and come home with a Vanagon or EuroVan
just by happening to see one for sale.  Is this not the case in other places?
