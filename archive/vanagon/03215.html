Subject:      Automatic to 4-speed tranny conversion

Sorry. Actually somehow this F&amp;*%$%$$# machine cut out the text of my msg and
sent it into some cyberlimbo. I asked if there was a conversion from 4 speed
to auto for my '85. I love the van and have had it for 3.5 years but it's the
first manual I ever had. Can someone explain to me what the allure (for many)
re manuals is?
