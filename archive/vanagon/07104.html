Subject: Arlo Guthrie


Trivia question of the day - In &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot;  is there a year 
mentioned for the microbus?  This is semi-serious, as my record player is 
defunct and I have not gotten a CD of this album.  

In addition, what other musical VW bus references does anyone know of?

I know of:

Artist			Song			Year	Type/Note
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arlo Guthrie -	 	Alice's Restaurant	'??	Microbus
Kraftwerk		Autobahn			Bug sound effect

So who else has an idle Friday?
