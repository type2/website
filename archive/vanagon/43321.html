&gt; &gt; Bakersfield, to orient you all.  OUrs will be Campsite #5, off
&gt; &gt; to the left on the road we take up to get there.  Please fill

Then Bradley corrected:

&gt; UGH!!  It's to your right as you drive up the road.  As you progress the 8
&gt; miles from 10 you'll see camping areas number... starting with 1... and
&gt; it'll work up 5. :)

I guess that's why Bradley ends up in the drivers seat alot, Eh, good buddy? ;p
