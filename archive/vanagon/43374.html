Subject: Dwell angle? '72 camper 009 distrb' /  34carbs.


The '72 type 2 camper 1.6L which owns me just now would like me to check
out the dwell angle, fitted is the 009 distributor, 34 pict carb. Also what
of the timing set up on a strobe. Usually the 1 timing mark on the pulley I
understand should be aligned with the case join line. Do I set this
slightly advanced with this distributor? and at what RPM?
 What of the solex pict 34 as fitted standard. Is there a better
alternative carb I can fit  available which would improve performance
slightly?

Thanks for reading and any help,

Jon O ,`,)  Danbury Type 2 camper, Edinburgh Scotland
