Subject: 70 single cab progress

	Friends,
	Yesterday saw some progress on the single-cab! My brother
Ian came over and we talked while I cleaned-up the garage so it
was convenient to work in.

	The exterior of the oil-bath air cleaner and all the engine tin 
that's being re-used was cleaned using gojo Orange hand cleaner and a 
brush. Results were EXCELLENT. My 71 914's oil bath air cleaner was
NEVER as clean as this one. The neighbors expressed amazement. Bill 
from across the street pointed out that the lanolin left over would 
have to be cleaned off prior to painting and recomended a weak phosphoric 
acid wash, or TSP. 

	Ian wonders if buying technical grade phosphoric acid would be
 cheaper than Naval Jelly or equivalents- Has any one ever done this? 
(And if you do, remember to dilute acid by pouring acid into the
wattah- like you oughta!) He also thought that a trip through the
dishwasher, and spraying the primer when the metal was still hot,
might be good. :-)

	I'm going to give the air-cleaner element a couple-of-days soak
and agitation in a bucket of paint thinner. There were metal chips in
the oil in the bottom of the air cleaner!

	The old transmission oil was drained and the old throw-out removed.
We confirmed that I have a later style throw-out and clutch,
which matches the arm in the tranny. We used the latest issue of 
DB&amp;HVW for reference here.

	Bill, my cross the street neighbor, offered to weld in the
replacement for the battery tray and fix a non-stock weld of the
air-cleaner support as well. He's a great guy. So I'm ordering
the correct, pickup, sheet-metal from Bus Boys or Bus Stop. Regular
T2 battery trays are $29 and pick-up trays are $69 from Bus Stop, but if 
there is a difference, the $40 is a foolish savings! 

	Judging from how its flaking off, the grey 'trunk-paint' type
stuff inside the engine compartment must really *be* trunk paint and
not factory installed! Anyone have a suggestion how to get something
like this off without damaging the factory paint?

	Finally we confirmed that we had all the nuts and bolts to connect
the engine and tranny, and Ian felt that the pilot bearing could use a
little Bosch grease, so he'll bring some over and we can join the twain
as soon as it suits us.

	Ian noticed that the fan on the old generator, presumably the
one that the DFO had on the engine (I got it in pieces remember) was
the old style, not like the new one ECI shipped with the dog-house cooling
setup. We idly speculated whether old fans and new shrouds would work
effectivly- would the different width of the fan mean that air could
get out around the shroud/fan juncture?

	Ian also noticed that ECI's shroud, apparently an aftermarket
item by its simplified warm-air-hose fittings, lacks the nipple for the
forced-air pipe that ventelates the charcoal canister. So we're going
to have to take the shroud off, punch a hole and braise a nipple on.
Not a big deal, but a small irritation. I should probably phone ECI 
and tell them that the unit supplied is not entirely turn-key for my
application. Lucky for us, Ian has a factory shroud with the nipple we
can copy.

	Thanks for all the help so far, list-friends!
