That poster was yours truly :-)

let me try to see if I can answer to some of the questions...
(and good luck with your EV!!!)

 &gt; Earlier this week I read something about piston slap being a problem with
 &gt; some 93 Eurovans. Based on the description of piston slap symptoms, I think
 &gt; my van has this condition.
Better get it checked.  Unfortunately, the only true way of checking
it is removing the cylinder head, and, unless you can convince the
dealer to do it for you for free, it costs a couple of hundred bucks
to diagnose.  VWOA does have a problem number for this (I must have
lost it, I could not dig it out), so you might try to get the dealer
to listen to the engine with a stetoscope, to gather evidence.  Once
you know there's a problem, then your battle with VWOA will begin, if
the warranty has run out :-( Mine was quite under warranty, so I had
no problem.

 &gt; 
 &gt; My question is, what does this mean? Is this a really, really bad thing,
 &gt; second only to the heartbreak of psoriasis, or is it a lesser evil like
 &gt; having dingleberries? Does piston slap, left untreated, develop into piston
 &gt; poke or piston punch?
Someone on this list once gave a very accurate description, maybe they
can re-post it???  Basically, the cylinder is unevenly worn, and the
piston is 'slapping' within the cylinder sideways, in addition to up
and down motion.  

 &gt; 
 &gt; (Okay, I'm getting a bit carried away here.)
 &gt; 
 &gt; Should I be concerned about piston slap? What actions do you
 &gt; recommend I tak
Yes, it is bad, it will mean loss of
compression, blow-by, oil burning, all prematurely.  When they
replaced my EV's engine, the service mgr. told me that they put in a
new block because the old one was beyond repair (I guess they meant
re-honing the cylinders).
 &gt; 
 &gt; Thanks,
 &gt;
