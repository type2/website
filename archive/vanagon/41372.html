Subject: Key Serial #'s

Looking at a breadloaf-era lock cylinder I have , I just noticed there is a
number stamped in the side.  This number is 35R052.  Is this the correct
format for a key serial number?  I know VW can make keys based on the
number, if you have it, but always wondered how you got it.  Also, can the
lock be re-keyed to another serial number? (boy, would a yes to this
question make my life easier)
