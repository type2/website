Subject: Re: instrument cluster bulb

&gt; Does anyone know how to remove the instrument cluster bulbs that light the
&gt; speedometer, tach and clock? One of them burned out and I cannot for the life
&gt; of me figure out how to get that little black bulb holder off?! I check
&gt; Bentley which said &quot;Remove bulb holder&quot;... Hmmm...
&gt; 
I haven't checked mine, but I think they're the same as a Jetta - 
twist 90 degress to release. They often require more force than one 
would expect, so care is required not to break anything.

And, in the case of the Jetta, which requires major surgery to get at 
them, they fail FAR too often... :(
