Subject: Re: Hes..Hes..Hesitation Problems

wher might one look for a &quot;new&quot; 34 pict carb. i didn't know they were still
being manufactured i assumed that the &quot;new&quot; carbs were actually (factory?)
rebuilds.

Please shed some light on this vanagon.lenti people.

michael
&gt;I strongly second the buy-new-34-pict advice.  The rebuilds often are
&gt;problematic and may keep you hunting for the (wrong) problem.  I run a
&gt;009 setup in my '70 Kombi (1600DP) with a new 34-pict.  Yeah, sure,
&gt;there's the minor hesitation at 1st, but it really charges (hah!) after
&gt;that.
&gt;
&gt;Good Luck!!
