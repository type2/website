Subject: Re: Ethical question on VW busses

 Therefore, it seems to me a hideous crime to lock a microbus.

&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any valuable insights?

Not to be rude or anything... &quot;Get a Clue.&quot;

I think it would be a symbol of my ignorence toward the world that I live in
if I had to walk every where I went because some jerk stole my unlocked
microbus. The insurance company would take it as a sign of no repayment
check if I told them that I left it unlocked because I though the &quot;VW Aura
of peace, love and unity&quot; would protect it. In the 'Nam they had a little
saying, &quot;Lock, rock and roll.&quot; I vote for proper caution, locking the doors
(get 'em fixed), smile for everyone, and a .357 for thieves. Wake up and
quit dropping acid!
