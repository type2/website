Hi:

I hate to do this but it finally comes the time to depart for at least some
time. I accepted another job offer from another company and will leave SUN
by the coming Friday. I am not sure I will have the luxury to be back to the
Vanagon list from my new job. Yes, I quit this job because I have had enough
of it and I have another opportunity which seems to be more interesting to
me.

So long everyone. Hope to be back again soon.

Gerry, please unsubscribe me. I had sent a mail to listserv_at_lenti already.
I guess I will be disconnected any time now.

(Not any more after Friday)
