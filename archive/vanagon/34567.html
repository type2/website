Subject: RE: Syncro: to lock or not to lock


Replacing a syncro tranny is a BIG $$$$$ expense.  Locating one is some work 
also.  When I bought my 87 syncro the diff lock didn't work and the dealer 
fixed it prior to me signing the papers.  Unless you really think you'll be 
driving frequently in conditions where getting stuck is a likely hood, i'd 
leave it alone.
You can always get a second opinion also.

|I just got this '86 Westfalia GL Syncro.  A lot of little thing were wrong
|with it and I am having them fixed.  No big deal.
|
|When I bought it the rear differential lock did not work.  I talked to a
|couple of mechanics and they told me that it is common for the servos to go
|bad and should be no problem to fix.
|
|Well the shop, which charges $70 per hour, has spent two hours and can only
|tell me that it is not the servo and that some thing is stuck.  They say 
that
|they will have to tear open the transmission and have no idea what they 
will
|find.  They recommend that I drive without fixing.  That I will only need 
it
|if I get stuck and that the 4-WD works great.
|
|Anybody out there ever use there rear differential lock?  How much would it
|cost to replace the whole tranny?
|
|Frustrated and owned a VW less than a week,
