VR-6?  Whee...  Kennedy are selling adapter plates, usual $480 I think.
Their quote is &quot;should be excellent choice when available&quot;  They must have
worked out the clutch details too. Don't know about the deck height/Syncro
skid plate probs, likely severe. As far as $1500 goes, grab it!!  at 9K
miles it's still new.  Gimme, gimme. I was quoted the same price for Subaru
flat four, 20K miles, 2 less cyls, 2 more years old, non-VW etc. Well used
Audi motors are running $500-700 here, well used.  $1500 + $500 to Kennedy
and it's still way cheaper than a wasserboxer rebuild. Sure it wasn't 90,000
on the clock? :)
