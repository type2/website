Yes, I have.  A fellow here at the University of Tornto has 
one.  He gave me a tour a couple of years ago, and I was 
very impressed.  (Of course, I'm kinda impressionable.)
The 207D had a washroom, with a shower, like a big RV!

Of course, another fellow I know has a Mercedes Diesel 
stepvan (don't remember the model) and an injection pump 
cost him over $4,000 about ten years ago.
