&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe the more important question is: why waste the propane when you
&gt; &gt; &gt; have another source of power that is immediately available and does
&gt; &gt; &gt; not tax any other resources (while the engine is on)?  am I missing
&gt; &gt; &gt; something?

&gt; On the issue of safety, I'm not trying to argue for running the fridge
&gt; on propane while driving, but how exactly is it more dangerous?  Is it
&gt; just because there is a lit flame?  I don't see how driving makes it
&gt; any more dangerous than having a lit flame when you are parked.  Sorry
&gt; if I'm overlooking something simple here.

And if the flame should go out when you are driving? A lot of fuss is made
about batteries needing proper ventilation because of the gasses they
produce. Could the same argument be made for an open propane line venting
into the cab?
