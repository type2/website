Subject: Garcia


My  heart is so heavy tonight.
If it were not for the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia I would not have:
-the intrest I have in VWs and my '76 Camper
-my girlfriend
-my BEST friends 
-lots of friends I have not met yet who wave or would stop if I was on 
the side of the road because they saw a Dead sticker
-the intrest in the varied styles of music that I do
-and lots more

Right after work today I went to he drug store and bought shoe polish. On 
the back window of my van it now says &quot;Jerry Garcia RIP 8/1/42 - 8/9/95&quot; 
and on a side window &quot;He was a friend of mine&quot;.
Please don't make fun, there are so many out there hurting right now.
Fuckingruven,
-gary
