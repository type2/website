I guess that's me, a new Wannabus.
What should I aim for in a bus? I would ideally like an easy to work on, 
comfortable, roomy, easy to get parts for Camper. Does this iron out any 
models?
I had thought of a 86-87, but am drifting back to 81-82, am I out to 
lunch here? The price difference is drastic, but the aircooled models 
would seem to have the edge in work-on ability in the engine compartment.
Would I be loosing a great amount of hp/torque without a waterboxer?
The Stories so far seem to relate to either woes in the water-cooled 
engine, or rust. No-one really complains about aircooled motors, or are 
you all just resigned to your fates?
So - Do I get a 81 with a good body, or bite the bullet and get a 86?


Help!
