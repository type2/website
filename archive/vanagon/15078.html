&gt; &gt; All this talk about cracked heads and leaking head gaskets is starting to get
&gt; &gt; me worried.  I may buy an '82 Westy with 81k (never had a rebuild).  How long
&gt; &gt; can I reasonably expect it to last without needing a major rebuild, i.e., 
&gt; &gt; what's the typical trouble-free lifespan for an aircooled Vanagon engine?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My heads and gaskets were replaced 20k miles ago at 133k miles.  I just got 
&gt; word that VW is willing to cover 80% of my cost of gaskets that just went 
&gt; out. So that says 20k miles. I'm also told that new gaskets are available 
&gt; as of six months ago which are better. I have a 1985 Westphalia.

I just called TWO dealerships in St. Augustine/Jacksonville area, one 
said that the deal was only for 1990-1992 vehicles.  The other guy said 
that he hadn't ever &quot;heard of such a thing.&quot;  He then told me that if my 
head gaskets had blown I could expect to buy a new engine because &quot;with 
all that corrosion you'll start breaking things, snapping bolts.&quot;  
I would LOVE to hear any SOLID proof concerning the money back (who get 
it, why, where, who can do the repair).  
ALSO, what about that guys statement on corrosion?  B.S. or IHNSHO?
