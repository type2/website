Subject: Stupid Bus/Van tricks

How about Stupid owner/dealer tricks.

When I was looking for vehicles, I was shown all the &quot;features&quot; by a dealership
in Denver, CO.  It was a one man operation, and all he dealt with was VW custom
conversions and Westys.  He showed me all the cool stuff like where to refill
the washer fluid, and stuff.

So, a few weeks later, I run out of washer fluid and proceed to refill it where
the dealer told me.  I pull off the cover above the steering wheel, and proceed
to top off the reservoir with solvent.

I hope you realize the problem here.  That was the brake fluid reservoir, and
man was I making a deadly mistake.  I didn't realize it till a few months
later, when I start wondering how to check the brake fluid levels (which the
dealer never showed me) that I realize what a complete and udder moron I am/was
for not looking up in the manual the location of the reservoirs, and taking
this a--hole's word.

I have a whole host of other little stories about this dealer if anyone in the
Denver, CO area is thinking of buying a van from him.  Suffice it to say, I am
not happy with the way he does business.

Incidentally, the van has been wonderful.  Taken me over 40,000 miles in the
past year, and faultlessly provided my only home for four months of that year.
