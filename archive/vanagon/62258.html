Subject: Re: Freon Conversions / Substitutes

&gt; It was suggested that pointing out that
&gt; 
&gt;          using Propane as a refrigerant in A/C systems is dangerous and
&gt; illegal
&gt; 
&gt; might give someone the idea to try it, instead of dissuading them as intended.
&gt; 
&gt; Now my question:
&gt; 
&gt; Do we have a greater moral obligation to such people to protect from their own
&gt; stupidity, or to the human race to allow nature to take its course?
&gt; 
&gt; Tom

Um, the later, I think.  BTW, can you mix the propane with the feon, or
do you have to evacuate the feon first?
