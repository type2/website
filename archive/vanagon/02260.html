Subject: how does this sound???


In my search for newer brick to replace the '82 westy diesel,I came 
across one:  

'91  Westy
123,000 miles, NO A/C

they're asking approximately $5,900.00 ...

sounds like a good deal, but...
how much would it cost me to put A/C in it?
when would the engine need rebuilding, and how much would it cost me?


I'll appreciate any ides, insigths, etc...
Thanks,
