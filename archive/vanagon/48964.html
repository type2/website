Subject: Westy miles per gallon

Hi and thanks for all the responses to the skylight question. Now I'm 
wondering about the gas mileage I'm getting on my 85 Westy. The 
seller said about 20-22 is this realistic? The needle seems to be 
dropping fairly quickly...is there anything I can do to improve 
mileage? I am using 93 octane. Also I'm having to replace the power 
steering rack...ouch...but that's another story...Thanks,
Rick
