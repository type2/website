&gt; The PO of Lewis smoked (Cigarettes!)...damn those POs...and I've been

&gt; heated discussion on how to get the bad smells out of your rig,
&gt; specifically the seats. Following your advise I steam cleaned the seats
&gt; and removed/washed the carpets.  Now a couple of months later Lewis
&gt; smells like a combination of smoke and carpet cleaner.
&gt; 
&gt; How do you get the ALL the bad smells out, how do you clean the
&gt; headliner, how do I get rid of the carpet cleaner smell?

Chris,

I smoke cigars and my girl friend will not enter the vanagon until I
have defunked it.  The product I use is a spray called Ozium, it's
expensive, but it's the stuff the airlines use.  It has a grapefruit
smell.
