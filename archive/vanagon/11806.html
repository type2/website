	That's interesting.  I sold my '67 to my brother in 1986
when we bought the '85 we have now.  I don't remember the numbers
any more, but I do remember that the '67 did run hotter the faster
we went in the summer.  And I had added the &quot;doghouse&quot; oil cooler
and made sure the tin and all seals were in place and in good shape.
I usually ran it between 55 and 60;  I think it got up to 270 or
so (maybe more, its too long ago) on a hot summer day.  The bug ran
much cooler - I did not have the two guages calibrated with each other
though.  I still have the mechanical dipstick oil temp probe and 
attached guage, but no bug to put it in.   Maybe someday......
