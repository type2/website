Subject: Re: Curtains

After receiving no less than 8 requests for curtain measurements, I pulled
out my little sheet of notes and tried to write up the following so that it
(hopefully) makes sense to readers.

I made a set of &quot;natural&quot; colored &quot;burlap&quot; weave curtains for my '80 Westy,
Frieda, shortly after buying her in 1988. Her original curtains shreaded
when I washed them. I tried to find the same heavy material that they had
been made of, but opted for the lighter onew instead. They let lots more
light in in the morning! Easier to get up - and still provided privacy.

Westfalia Curtains for '80 -'91 models (I believe all are the same)

    | =====x=====  ===========  ---- /
        R1   L1         SD

    R1 + L1 = 1 Pair; make 3 pair 
    each curtain measures 32&quot;W x 26&quot;L rough cut
    finished measurement = 30&quot;W x 22 1/2&quot;L

    Rear: LR1 + RR1 = 1 Pair; make 1 pair
    each curtain measures 30&quot;W x 28&quot;L rough cut
    finished measurement = 28&quot;W x 23 1/2&quot;L

    (the view -L,R- is from the inside out!)

    Side Door: 62&quot;W x 28&quot;L

    For all but the front, purchase 4.5 yds of 54&quot; material
    as a minimum. 5 yards of wider material is helpful.
    Use medium to heavy weight &quot;burlap&quot; type material.
    Presoak/wash in water and vinegar to set color and 
    preshrink. Line dry. (Use just a reasonable amount of
    white vinegar!)

    Lay out 5-32&quot;W x 26&quot;L pieces across top length and
    1-32&quot;W x 26&quot;L piece, 2-30&quot;W x 28&quot;L pieces and 1-
    62&quot;W x 28&quot;L piece along the bottom length. Cut out 
    and hem pieces to provide double fold-over sides and
    double fold over edges for finish of top and bottom to
    run on metal runners, or finish bottom edges.

    (Make sure that you provide about 3/4-1&quot; 'space' for rod
     to run through at top and some bottom edges. Sew ends
     over first - then make top and bottom folds so that rod
     can run through top or bottom of panel.)

    Use velcro for 2 evenly spaced 1&quot; strips to hold center
    edges closed for privacy. Use thin elastic in bottom of
    side door curtain.

    Front curtain is a little more tricky! Measures (finished) 
    10' 10&quot;W x 271/2&quot; L. Add enough material (11' W x 30&quot;L
    approx.) to provide hem with 3/4&quot; doubled over band
    at top and sides and 1/2&quot; at bottom. Requires snaps to
    match those installed in van - or glue velcro to van 
    and sew to curtain to match. Requires elastic in top to
    gather and hold in place. Be carful to measure your
    van's front window span and allow extra width to fit.

     Have Fun! They really are rather simple to make!
