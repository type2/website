My mother has a converted '68 bus that no longer makes use of the
original middle bench seat. It's black and in good condition.  She
doesn't have a place to store the seat and would like to give it to
somebody who can use it.

She's located in Napa, CA - if you can pick it up, it's yours!  Give me
a call at 415-267-1226.

Steve
