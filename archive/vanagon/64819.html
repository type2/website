I have never been able to find an easy to install upgrade to the Vanagon
brakes.  The calipers will not accommodate the extra thickness of a
ventilated rotor.  You could cross drill the rotor, but I don't know if
that would help.

There is apparently a conversion kit from MDS for four wheel ventilated
Porsche disc brakes (I have heard ~$1000 US).  This is apparently the
same setup used by VW for the Paris to Dakar rally.  I have also seen
Mercedes ventilated rotors installed in place of the rear drums on a
type 2, but the brake proportioning valve is not correct for this.  It
may be possible to use Mercedes or Audi calipers and rotors, but
extensive machining would probably be required.

I had brake fade in the Rockies using old hardened rotors and
aftermarket pads.  I have since gone back to the OEM rotors and pads.
All the squeal has also disappeared.

Anyone else out there have comments?
