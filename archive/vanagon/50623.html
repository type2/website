 Howdy, Could someone point me to the page(s) in the Bentley which illustrate
 the lube points for a late model vanagon. I have searched both the Bentley
 and archives with no success. I also spent a bit of time searching under the
 van and didn't recognize any grease points.
 
 Thanks, Patrick &gt;&gt;


most everything is lubed for life(however long it lasts).  Only parts
requiring lube are the C/V joints and wheel bearings and this takes some
effort.
