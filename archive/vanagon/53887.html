&gt; I've actually looked into using a bicycle computer as a tachometer for
&gt; my wife's Eurovan.  It is trivial to hook up, and one can compensate
&gt; for the 5-cyl. engine using the tire size calibrator (most
&gt; J.C. Whitney and other tachs are not set for 5 cyl. engines).
&gt; 
JCWhipme sells a digital tach, with LCD readout and a 2&quot; case for about
$45 that works great.  It uses an inductive pickup on one spark-plug wire
and so works on *any* number of cylinders and any kind of ignition.  On
Vanagons, the sender wire is not long enough to reach the dash from the
engine (Hey, imagine that!).  The sender uses a shielded wire, and you need
to extend it with similarly shielded wire.

Cheap Tach, works good -- and it's that same Equus brand that people have
been talking about for the cruise controls.
