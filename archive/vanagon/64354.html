Subject:      Re: Clunking noise when start....

Could be the clutch disk momentarily sticking to either the flywheel or plate
after sitting for a spell, or the first sign of the pilot bearing going. If
the pilot bearing you should also start having some signs when shifting, as
the drag on the input shaft makes the trans unhappy.
