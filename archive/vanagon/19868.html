Sergio...please do not make generalizations that ALL new VWs are
pieces of shit...or do not last 200k miles like old beetles etc...

from my point of view that is just your OPINION...my perception
of newer VWs is that they are, dare I say, even more reliable
than their earlier air-cooled counterparts. What do I base this
perception...or hell, even opinion on? FACTS...yep Facts...

In my storage area is my 1986 GTI which I took off the road in order
to have a project car for my 16yr old son as he gets ready for his
license...this GTI was purchased new by me in July 1986....it
has 215k miles on the original engine/trans...it carried my wife
and I to three local autocross championships, 4 local rally championships,
Northeast East Divisional SCCA rally championship, 2 New England Regional
SCCA rally championships...all while being used as a daily driver..
and for long distance trips.

I feel confident enough in the car that I will use it as a father/son
project car and to have my son drive it as his first car...

Currently we own a 1993 EuroVan....it has 36k miles on it...totally
trouble free...contrary to some of the &quot;opinions&quot; stated by the
non-EuroVan owners on this list...it handles extremely well...
it has plenty of power/torque...its is relatively quiet on the
highway at speeds in excess of 75mph...bottom line I would
buy another again....and again...and again!

I'm sorry that you have had tons of problems with your VW...perhaps
you have a lemon...perhaps its bad karma...or VANma as the case
may be...but your sample results don't jive with my sample results...
therefore IMHO, your sample results are not valid!
