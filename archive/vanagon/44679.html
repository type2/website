Subject: '68 Westy FS in SF (Rock and roll memorabilia)


Talking to a friend in SF last night he mentioned that his guitar teacher
was selling his '68 Westy for $1,000 in &quot;pretty good shape&quot;.  Now as I am
in VA, it is a bit far for me, but if anyones interested, I will try for
more details.  His teacher, BTW, is the ex-lead guitarist for the group
&quot;The Tubes&quot;, so it is a more than mildly authentic &quot;hippy bus&quot;, and comes
with a bit of history.  The story of how he comes to be disposing of it is
also a bit humourous.  He was in second on one of SF's hills when a '91
Westy pulled up along side.  As he watched it coming up, he decided he
wanted &quot;one of those VW's with acceleration&quot;, and as it passed he noticed
the &quot;For Sale&quot; sign.  Needless to say, he is its current owner.  Let me
know if you are interested, and I will make inquiries
