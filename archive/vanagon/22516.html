&gt; 
&gt; Pre-Porschephiles,
&gt; 
&gt; The subject car is for sale in San Jose.  I've seen it and it is original,
&gt; running and complete, although I think the bumpers are incorrect.  It is a
&gt; straight original car with no rust.  Green with what looks like original
&gt; interior in good conditon.

Well, whaddaya think?

Thom
