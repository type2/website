Subject: &quot;NO Start Problem&quot;

Fellow contributors of this group - Thank you for you inputs on the infamous
VW &quot;
No Start&quot; problem.

Wife &amp; 4 kids gone for 2 weeks, due back today.  Gotta go get them from the
airport in the van 'cause of all the stuff they have, stroller, suitcases,
special medical equip. etc.

Plane is scheduled in at 5:30, figure an hour to an hour and a half because of
traffic, so gotta leave about 4 =&gt;4:15.  About 3 o'clock climb in the van that
hasn't moved a wheel for at least a week to got fill the tank, spin the key to
&quot;glow&quot; and wait for the light, hit the start position and  -- total silence!
Nada, Nichts, Zip, Zilch, and a few unprintable explatives herewith deleted.

Remember the mystery no start at the end of a concert in the parking lot
trying to fire up to go home, the initial &quot;no start&quot; overshadowed because it
started on the second try, but the glow plug relay stuck &quot;on&quot; and grabbed all
the attention.  Then remember the string on this group about this problem.  

Went to the garage and got my &quot;poor man's&quot; creeper ( a flattend out cardboard
box, works great, provides a little padding, insulates from the ground,
emergency absorbant material for spills, disposable, free, . . . ) and a
rubber mallot and tried to look up at the starter from in front of the right
rear wheel.  Well, if I crane my neck I can get a clear line of sight to the
connections, but to reach up in there, ya gotta be kidding!

So, discard that approach and go in through the engine hatch.  Took about 5
minutes of various contortions before I finally figured out a way to get my
hand on the spade connector from the ignition switch, pulled it off and then
pushed it back on.  Back up front to the driver's seat, re-glow and hit start
- - - - Success!!!

Started to and from the &quot;gas&quot; station, started  on the way to the airport,
started at the airport to repark, started to get us all home, started to go
out and bring home a quick take out supper.  All without a hitch or hick- up.

Will try and find the time to pull that connector off again and very slightly
squeeze the female connector so that it grips the other connector a little
more firmly and scrapes through the oxide on the surface as it is pushed home.

Once again - Viele Danke, Muchas Gracias, Many thanks to the contributors that
tipped me to the solution to this problem.  Without your inputs I had been
puzzling in the aftermath of trying to analyze WHY the starter didn't spin
that first time at the concert.
Harvey
