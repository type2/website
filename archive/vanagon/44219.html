Hi All, 

As a relative newbie to Vanagons, I was quite pleased to experience the 
ease of the dropping the engine and tranny as a unit from the vehicle.  
My previous efforts involved removing the engine (wassers) from the 
tranny and it went ok, but not 'enjoyable' as dropping both units together 
Once the CV's etc. were disconnected, things really go fast!  8-)

&gt; People keep writing to me to say that I'm crazy for trying to mate a

&gt; badly in that regard.
&gt; The plan (in progress) is to remove the engine AND the transmission from
&gt; the Diesel Westfalia and replace it with the engine AND transmission
&gt; from the '84 1.9L Vanagon with the gas engine.
&gt; 
&gt; I've disconnected everything and am ready to drop the engine as soon as I
&gt; can measure whether I can get it out while the van is still in my carport
&gt; or if I have to take it out of the carport.
