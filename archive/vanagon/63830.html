Subject: Re: bleed valve

I have cleaned, flushed, cleaned and flushed the coolent system.  
1.  How much coolent does the system hold?  
I removed one lower radiator hose and the thermostat housing so there
should not be very much coolent remaining in the system.

 I have the bleeding process down, but need a general idea as to how
much antifreeze I will need to add.  I am going for a 30% water, 70%
antifreeze mixture. This is alot of work. 

 I don't think I would trust many garages to do this job correctly. 
Most people won't apply this much effort to getting it right.
