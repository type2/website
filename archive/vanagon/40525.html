Subject: RE: Alternate Engine ? Revisited


&gt;but does anyone out there have a
&gt;name and number of someone whose put a Subaru 2.2 in an air-cooled
&gt;type two (a pre-68)?

Kennedy Engineered Products (southern CA, area code 805 I think) makes
adapters for these, which is probably what you're talking about isn't it.
But if you call them, they might give you a list of satisfied users who
have put this engine in their splittie.

They are also working on a modern Subaru 122hp engine adaption. They're
currently trying to make it smog legal in all 50 states. Don't know if
they're setting it up for splits (no rear engine mount), but it's
possible.


&gt;Got a friend whose about ready to get a new engine and he's
&gt;considering this option (if that's possible).  (or else a 2020cc if
&gt;the Sub conversion is a no-go)
&gt;
&gt;And no, Steve, I already told him no Citation engine!  &lt;big smiles&gt;

Can't say I blame you. I haven't pinned my troubles specifically to this
engine rather than some other quirk, but the weird balance characteristics
of the Chevy 2.8L V8 make it real hard to sort out the relevant details.
Do yourself a favor and use a Ford instead.

Kind of a shame-- the Chevy engine drives wonderfully, lotsa nice
torque from a small package, runs real cool, idles so smoothly and quietly
you can't tell it's running (about time that mechanical starter cutout
in the ignition switch earned its keep). Gas mileage is poor, which is
just as likely to be the mechanic's fault (c'est moi) as the engine's
fault.
