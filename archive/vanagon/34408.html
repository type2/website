The Transporter sounds like a news letter many of us would be interested 
in.....
Would Jim D.  make the joining/subscribing info available to all on the 
list?
If not, please respond in person to:

Thanks,
Fred

|Hi, Brett--
|Hot VWs and VW Trends cater to all kinds of VWs, and I think it would be
|rare to find something pertaining to 70s era Westies in them. As far as
|all-model VW magazines go, Ben is right is saying Volksworld may be
|better (some bigger news stands will have it in stock). If you can read
|French, my favorite is Super VW Magazine, edited by Jacky Morel. Also sort
|of hard to find, but has amazing photos and great layout.
|
|But, the top o' the heap for relevance to a '77 Westy would be LiMBO's
|&quot;The Transporter.&quot; LiMBO is a club for owners and admirers of '68 to the
|present VW vans of all years (Jim DiGennaro: does this include Sharans?)
|Their newsletter is 6 times a year. Jim D. in on the List, and I'm sure
|he'll get in touch with you about how to join/subscribe.

|&gt; I am planning on subscribing to one of the various VW magazines available
|&gt; and I was wondering which one was &quot;best&quot;.  Actually the only two I've 
seen
|&gt; are Hot VW's and VW Trends.  Are there others?  I would like one that has
|&gt; articles that pertain to my '77 Westy.  Thanks for your thoughts on the
|&gt; subject.
