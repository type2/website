&lt;&lt; I want to put a tach in my &quot;new&quot; 83 water-cooled Westy. I've never been
quite
 so far from an engine, and since i replaced that noisey transmission I can't
 hear when to shift. Instead of a tach I have that HUGE clock in the dash--
as
 if I need to be reminded of my mortality.
 
 I understand the later Vanagons have the tach in that spot. Can I just find
a
 later model (in a junkyard I mean I've read about the alarms) and install
 that tach in my vehicle? Will my gas gauge and temp gauge fit in the new
 tach, or does the tach have different fuel and temp gauges? If different
will
 my existing senders work accurately with the new gauges? Or, and finally,
 should I, or do I have to replace the entire instrument cluster using the
 later model speedo and digital clock etc.
 
 Any advice from those who know or have done the swap will be appreciated.
 
 Thanks

yes, you can put the entire inst panel cluster from a '85-'91 vanagon with
the tach, and digital clock in a earlier one.
I have even seen a '80 with the later cluster, and they had a oil temp sender
hooked up to the coolant gauge instead, but since your van is watercooled, it
will be easier for you.
You will need to re-arrange the pins on the 14point multipin connector, but
it's not hard. You will also need to run a wire from the coil underneath the
van up to the 14 pt connector, but that's not a big deal either.
