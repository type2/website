&gt; 
&gt; I recently purchased an '81 Westy.  The pop top's surface has small cracks 
&gt; all over on the finish.  Also it is grey from dirt.  Any suggestions on how 
&gt; to clean the top to get it back to its original white?   Also what can I put 
&gt; on the fiberglass top to keep it from getting dirty again soon?
&gt; 

No info on cleaning.  But to keep it from getting dirty again, you should
put a gel-coat on it.  Not sure what this entails.  If you have access
to Usenet, post your question to rec.boats.building.  They should be able
to help.

Or, go down to your local boat repair shop and ask them.
