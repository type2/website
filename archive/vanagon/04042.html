Subject: Re: STATISTICS VANAGON (fwd)

    So it looks like people are going to start posting replys to 
    anything???? 
    
    Even if they have nothin' to say????  
    
    Just to get to the top of the list?????  
    
    Is being on top that prestigious????  
    
    Can I construct a message purely out of interrogative 
    sentences????
    
    How many question marks after a sentence should I put in????
    
    Eric
