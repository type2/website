&gt; Actually, the air being discharged from the A/C vents should be pretty 
&gt; dry.  Most of the moisture will be condensed out when the air passes 
&gt; across the A/C evaporator coil.  As the air travels through the duct it 
&gt; will warm slightly, bringing the residual moisture content well below 
&gt; dew-point and avoiding any further condensation.  
&gt; 

	Wes, you describe technically what my intuition told me.
	It didn't seem like there would be a problem forcing chilled air
	through the body ducts. Even if there was some condensation, again,
	my intuition told me the air flow would drive adequate evaporation
	of whatever moisture accumulated. But, then, I'm a potter by trade
	and only guess at shit like this. :)

	New sub:

	I'm fascinated by names and accents. How is your last name pronounced?

	I'd guess: Noinshvanda
