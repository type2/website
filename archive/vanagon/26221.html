&gt;&gt;Steve reminded me (us):
&gt;&gt;Uh... SUV: 1939 Jeep?

&gt;Rusty sez:
&gt;How about a covered wagon? Before wagons there was the horse. How about the
&gt;thing made out of to poles with a hide across them that the Native 
Americans
&gt;of the Great Plains used to drag behind them? I think mebbe &quot;Og&quot; the 
caveman
&gt;used an old hide to drag his family around on before the pole fad hit. 
&quot;Oj&quot;,
&gt;Og's abusive brother used to drag his family around by their hair... 
Nothing
&gt;like a trip with the family!


Absolutely!

But, best of all, who can forget the inventor in the B.C. comic strip,
who kept riding around with his feet on the wooden axle of a large
stone wheel? With or without Monroe shocks.

Anybody got anything to predate that?

Flintstone-mobile, maybe?
