Subject: Re: Dometic fridge part needed

&gt;The part I need is the copper pipe 
&gt;(plus nuts)that lies allong the top of the fridge and connects with the pipe
&gt;to 
&gt;the tank at one end and at the other end connects to the on/off valve.

Unfortunately, this replacement part is neither available from VW
(253-070-610B) or Dometic any longer.  However, both Dometic and
Euro-American/Delta Six has informed me that this is a standard American Pipe
Thread fitting nut(s) &amp; copper line that are available from any RV Supply
House and that it has to be custom-made.  The overall length is about 40
inches long (1004mm in the parts fiche).  VW's last price for this piece was
an outrageous $46.30.  I'm sure you can have it done for a lot cheaper.  If I
had any, I would be glad to provide, but alas :-( .......Maybe its time start
makin' some of these lines....I'm gonna look into it.
