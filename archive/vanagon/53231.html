&gt;  My dealer doesn't have the boot in stock.  Neither does Toronto, so
&gt; it's coming from California, and should be here by Dec 20..  It costs
&gt; $47.00 CDN.  They hope to undo
&gt; the tie-rod from the rack, and preserve the wheel alighnment.  They
&gt; figure 1.5 hours work.  If they have to undo the tie-rod at the ball
&gt; joint, that will be 3.5-4.5 hours including a wheel alignment!  So,
&gt; let's hope the shorter time prevails!!

&gt;Harry : I just had to replace a boot on my Syncro. It was very easy and took me between a hour and a hour and a half. I was able to get it apart so I didn't have to do a alignment. I bought a boot at a local VW flaps and it was only $7. It had the VW logo on it and was exactly the boot I took off. You might check around. Todd Francis
