Subject: Re:Sliding door, (use WD-40 for rubber?)

Don't have a quoting offline reader. Steve Bibler I think.
Solved side sliding door sticking by lubricating the black
rubber seal. Fine, But I'd suggest spray silicone lubricant,
rather than WD-40. Any oil based lubricant will deteriorate
rubber. Silicone is good for rubber.
