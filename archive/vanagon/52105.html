&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Volks,
&gt;&gt; Is the &quot;Sierra&quot; brand an acceptable substitute for VW dealer coolant for 
&gt;&gt; use in a wasserboxer?. I will have to drive 50 miles and pay $15/gal for 
&gt;&gt; VW coolant. The local VW shop sells Sierra rather than VW coolant due to 
&gt;&gt; the cost they say. Tell me volks, what to do. Also, what of the pink 
&gt;&gt; Toyota phosphate-free coolant? Is this more acceptable? I heard from one 
&gt;&gt; source that Sierra does not have that good of an anti-corrosion package 
&gt;&gt; and this is the last thing I want, even though it is phosphate-free. Any 
&gt;&gt; and all feedback appreciated.
&gt;&gt; Regards

&gt; Hi all: I don't remember who reported it, but awhile back someone was
using Sierra coolant in their Vanagon and had to take the engine apart for
some reason. Inside they found little green crystals apparently caused by
the coolant. To me that didn't sound good.
