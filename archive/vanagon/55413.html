Subject: Re: Vanagon &quot;annihilation&quot; on TV.......


I saw it on the news when it happened, I believe it was in San Diego.  
The guy ends up high-centering the tank on a freeway jersey barrier and 
getting shot (for resisting arrest I think, not squashing the Vanagon).

&gt; One of the chaces involves the pursuit of a stolen Army tank wreaking havoc in a
&gt; residential area somewhere in SoCal. The driver is intentionally running over
&gt; vehicles and anything in his path.
&gt; One shot from a Police chopper zooms in on a dark grey metallic Vanagon (the
&gt; color that was widely used on the '87-'88 wolfsburg ed.) that is right in the
&gt; tanks path......
&gt; SQUASH!!!!
&gt; It actually pushes the Vanagon backwards for a bit until it hits a RV, then
&gt; squashes the Vanagon, as well as the RV behind it. 
&gt; 
&gt; They later show a closeup of the Van after it was squashed. The drivers side and
&gt; the roof were crushed to the ground, and a little of the passengers side
&gt; remained.

&gt; ouch...
