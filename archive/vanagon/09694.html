&gt; If you REALLY do need a full blown break job, you should check out the &quot;Bullet 
&gt; Train&quot; break system upgrade kit from Martin Schnider Design Systems (MSDS).
&gt; 
&gt; The kit includes drilled front rotors, steel break lines, and better than OEM 
&gt; quality pads for both front and rear. The system got a favorable review in 
&gt; January's issue of European Car. They noted significantly improved pedal feel 
&gt; and much reduced fade after extended breaking.

I saw that review also.  The thing that came to mind was if it created more
front end dive.  Considering the tall height and short wheel base.  I can just
see the spare tire cover hitting the ground.  (I have done several times where
this parking lot exit slopes down, has a dip and the road goes uphill.  Even if
you go slow...)
