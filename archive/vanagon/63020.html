Subject:      fuel problems - fixed!!

Background: A couple of mornings ago, my van starting having power
problem, sputtering, etc.  I parked, walked up to school, got some
suggestions from the list(fuel filter, fuel pump, pressure regulator,
etc)  When I went back to the van it ran fine.  I let it be, happy it was
running, but anticpated a problem in the future.

Last night: Van dies at a stop light, wont start.  I climb out and gas is
dripping from underneath.  I pull over to a lot and find a fuel hose that
has come undone.  After getting hooked back up, it runs good again.  I
suppose the moral is to check the hoses before checking the fuel pump.
(I probably wouldn't have check this hose anyway since is was hard to get
at).

Question:  the fitting that came undone is a smaller hose jammed into a
larger hose with a clamp on it.  (a cruddy crimp clamp) This seems a bit
leak prone.
Is this leak prone?
Should I replace all the crimp clamps with the standard screw clamps?
Is it feasable to replace the smaller fuel lines with the larger ones,
and then this splice is unnecessary?

As usual, thanks, and thanks again to those who replied the first time.
