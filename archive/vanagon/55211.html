Tonya, 
        faulty windshield seal seems to be a common vanagon problem. It
happened to me this past summer...after each rain storm, there was a small
puddle on each floormat. A short in your wiring due to this leak is highly
likely, although it didn't happen to me. To fix the seal, I simply ran a
bead of clear silicon caulk between the seal and the van, no leaks since. If
you look carefully all the way around the windshield, you will probably see
a point at which the seal pulls away from the van. 

Good luck, Pat

&gt;As such, I'm
&gt;thinking that maybe the wind was just right to get water behind my dash
&gt;somehow?  I think a couple of drops actually fell from the bottom of the
&gt;dash onto the floor while I was driving--reason for my suspicions.
