Just went outside and measured my 60 Singlecab, which would be the same as
a 67.  Comes to 5' 1/2&quot; wide, 8' 7&quot; long, and 15&quot; deep.  These things are
great for carrying LOTS of plywood (including baltic birch 5x5' sheets) and
queen-size mattresses and the like.  Also great for loading long, bulky
items like couches, because both toters can set them in the truck at the
same time (by lowering one side gate and the rear gate), rather than having
one poor sod put the end down on the tailgate, climb up onto the thing, and
then bend all the way down to pick the couch up and back up to the front of
the bed, as in one of those rattletrap US built pickups.  If you have a bed
canopy, even those brazilian cab-flush things (I've got one of these) will
allow you to carry an AMAZING amount of boxes of stuff (I helped a friend
move once:  He had one of those puny Toyotas without a shell.  We got at
least 3 times as much stuff in the VW!).  I've also used it for hauling
brush and lath and plaster (bathroom remodel bones) to the dump.  I go
alone, can arrive after 2 guys with similar stuff in a &quot;conventional&quot;
pickup, take a rake and empty the entire bed in less than a minute, and be
on my way before the other guys are half done.  I've also used mine to
refill my smoke wrench bottles (oxy-acetylene torch).  Bed height is
perfect for truck loading docks (though I had to lift the bottles up from
my driveway to the bed, probably should have built a ramp).  That's the
only serious drawback, the height of the bed.  But, to compensate, you get
all that lockable storage space under the bed!  Mine had a 22 gallon gas
tank installed by one of the POs.  I drove from Whittier to Flagstaff (~475
miles) on one tank of gas.  Cool.  They're quiter than buses too.

I should have sold VW's in those days!
