Hi all!
Well I just got back from 10 days of vacation and am convinced never to 
leave my mailbox unattended.  776 messages from to mailing groups is a lot 
to sort through.
Anyway, for Martha and David, put me on the trip list.  I am not sure the 
trek would want to swing through Houston in the summer, but maybe  central 
or northern Texas would be a good meeting area.  There is a place just south 
of Fort Worth called Farm
Fresh.  They evidently restore buses and have had a couple of them featured 
in the VW mags in the last year.  May be a good place to gather.
I spent my vacation in Santa Fe,NM.  15 hour drive from Houston(we took the 
Passat)
My wife is not that adventurous to take a summer trip in an un-ACed bus.  To 
the person who recommended NM for a place to look for Buses, I saw a large 
number
while I was out there, but not many for sale.  Most on the road were pretty 
rough.
Looked like to much winter mountain driving with a little off-roading mixed 
in.
Also not beat the octane vs. brand vs. etc. horse too much, just my personal 
observation.  Because of pinging under hi-way conditions during hot weather 
I always
use 93 octane(the super premium down here).  I primarily use Shell because 
it is close to the house and office.  My driving is 90% hi-way/10% city.  I 
drive 70 miles a day, 5 days a week.  The only other brand I use is Texaco. 
 I don't use it very often because the bus develops a 
severe(bucking/stumble) drivability problem when I use
it.  This is independent of which station I purchase the gas from and always 
goes away when I switch back to Shell.  Anyway just my $.02.
