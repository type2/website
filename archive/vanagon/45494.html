Subject: Need help finding propane adapter/fitting (nonVW)

Hi folks,

I'm hoping someone might know of a source for the fitting I seek.   I have a
two burner propane stove that currently has a hose with a brass fitting for
a large 20/25 lb tank.  Since I happen to have a little collection of 1
pound tanks from miscellaneous camping/torch equipment and only use the
stove rarely (therefore have no need to lug around a 20 lb tank) I'm looking
for an adapter that will connect to the large fitting that's currently on my
stove hose and allow me to screw on a 1 lb tank.  I've been having an
incredibly hard time locating this through local RV/boating stores and no
luck from the West Coast Marine catalog.  Under most circumstances this type
of adapter would probably be inefficient, but I have the small tanks and I'd
like use them. I'm wondering now if this type of adapter is even made. Any
sources out there?

Thanks,




Ron
