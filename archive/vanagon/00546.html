&gt; If you are going to be replacing your entire fuel line, consider fitting the

&gt; with gas, one can shut off the fuel supply before removing anything.

&gt; I have not set this up in my 1970 camper, but I plan to when I remove the
&gt; engine for cleaning and maintenance.  I have not yet found a suitable valve
&gt; or petcock, so I can't recommend what kind of valve to use.

Someone on the VintageVW list suggested the plastic beer brewing tube 
clamps.  I picked up a couple at my sisters lab, I guess chemists use 'em 
also. :)  Otherwise, try a boating store.  They should have marine 
quality brass fittings.
