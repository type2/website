Rusty -

Your's is the first I've heard of this problem.  When we designed these we
used an OEM latch (both left and right) to make sure the &quot;deck height&quot; of the
latch was as close as could be possibly made.  They have fit and have worked
very well on my Factory Safaris, as well as a few others that I have kept
close contact with out there.  A 1/4&quot; sounds really far off the standard we
went by.  Are you sure the Latch Tabs (or striker plates as VW calls them)
are angled correctly?  VAG (In their Service Installation Bulletin) does
state that the latch tabs are to be adjusted by bending them in or out if the
installation is too tight or too loose.  If yer not happy, it's no problem
refunding yer money, 'cause I want ya to be happy with what ya can get.  Keep
me posted, OK?
