&gt;hey a girl Vanagon fan!! YAY!!! 

Likewise!  I have seen some of your posts and love your signature line.  
Nice to know
there are some of us girls out there in Vanagons.

&gt;Im the owner of a 89 Vanagon GL namd Bessie. She's me &amp; my son's best 
&gt;friend, takes us where ever with no probs. 
&gt;She wasn't mint likey ours but in excellent shape bodywise; 
&gt;mechanically was another story. about $3000 later(heads,alt.,
&gt;waterpump, clutch master and labor!) she's fine now. Just keep an eye 
&gt;on the rear end on the ground!! If yours starts to drip, take 'er in. 

Does it drip coolant or water? I think mine drips water from the air 
conditioner
compressor but it is not the blue coolant color. 
&gt;My heads blew with the water pump about a year &amp; 1/2 ago. Granpa was 
&gt;nice enough to bail me out and pay it. She had over 100,000 miles 
&gt;when that happened. I got her with 96,000+ (hard to find a low miler 
&gt;since they're not made anymore) and right now she's at 127,+++ miles.
&gt;
&gt; To keep the engine from overheating, just keep the water levels 
&gt;right &amp; oil in and she should be ok. If that  doesnt work, have the 
&gt;thermostat looked at or could be a blockage in the cooling system. 
&gt;You can't really keep anything from happening. The head gaskets were 
&gt;designed bad, entropy takes over and wears them out, coolant will 
&gt;leak some day. (S***t like this happens with ANY car, remember NO car 
&gt;is perfect)

Sigh. I know you are right and I am preparing for it, but I am so nuts
about it I want to protect it. 

&gt;$3000 for a muffler system!?!?? yeah right! Never heard that one 
&gt;before. It's true Vanagons are NOT cheap like the air cooled buses, 
&gt;but not THAT much for exhaust! I saw it in the Bus Boys online 
&gt;catalog(www.busboys_dot_com) for $300. Stainless steel? I doubt it's 
&gt;stainless, mine's all yukky lookin. And the muffler tailpipe rusts 
&gt;out eventually.

Thanks, you back up what others have said. This is a big relief. I did
 replace the very end tailpipe already, for about $28 from a local 
foreign auto parts store. The muffler looks orange to me, but the 
mechanic who checked it out did not think it looked like it would go
soon.


&gt;TO keep it in excellent shape, just create a maintanence 
&gt;schedule(mine sucks, Bessie's due for her yearly tune up, but im 
&gt;broke right now!) and wash her yourself!! Vacuum, detail, everything. 
&gt;Bessie still looks respectable after 2 1/2 yrs, she doesn't look much 
&gt;different from when I got her.

&gt;SHe's be great as your doggie show van!! You can strap the portable 
&gt;cages on the little roof section the top has. (what breed?) Plenty of 
&gt;roomfor the doggies to be comfy, plus you can put their food in the 
&gt;fridge&amp; keep it nice. (I wanna camper!!)

I have two Lhasa Apsos (they are the small ones with long hair that
 look a lot like Shih Tzus or miniature English Sheep Dogs.) They are
 seasoned travelers and love camping in the Vanagon. I have gone 
camping with them twice already at dog shows and they seem to 
like it a lot. 


&gt;&gt;&gt;I fell in love at first sight.
&gt;thats what happened to me when I saw Bessie all alone at the dealer 
&gt;with 'manager's special $7999' scribbled on her windshield. They 
&gt;havent had a vanagon since! VERY VERY popular vehicle in SoCal!!!!!

You have the right climate for Bessie. I worry about subjecting Johann - 
I am sure he is male - to New England winters when he grew up in Georgia.
I am even thinking of getting a cover for him for the worst of winter. 
I do not have a garage or carport. 

Great to hear from you. If you are ever up in New England let me know!
