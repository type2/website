Subject: Oh ohh, tires

Just back from my second camping trip in my new used '88 Westfalia.  

My beloved just left a message to say the new luggage rack and roof seal 
is in from California Imports in BC.

AND the sun is shining here in Sudbury Ontario Canada! 

So... I need new tires for the Westy.   I saw reference in a note earlier 
today that light truck tires are the way to go because this was orgginal 
equipment and that gas mileage would be improved.

So what does the list have to say. Should I go the light truck tire route 
or something else?

Barry!

So the question si...  just whatr
