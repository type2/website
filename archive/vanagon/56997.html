Subject: Sticking park brakes

My son bought a gizmo for the cables on his motorbike which I have used 
on other kinds of bowden cables.  It gets clamped on the end of the 
housing and a pressure lubricant is attached to a fitting .  It forces 
the oil up the cable housing and keeps the cable from rusting in side the 
housing.  using that and anti-seize compound on the moving parts should 
go a long way to preventing the kinds of problems being described.

Its what i'm going to do if I ever stop all the coolant leaks I keep 
finding and have time to do a brake job!
