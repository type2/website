Yes, I agree with Alistair -- you can take your plastic window trim out,
but if you want to replace it, you will need to remove and reinstall the
glass.  I would even suspect you would want to buy new trim, rather than
painting the old, as it is pretty brittle after all these years of sunshine.
My vote: take it out and leave it out.
