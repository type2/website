&gt; &gt; I think it's Somebody's Theory that if you make a chain from person
&gt; &gt; X to person Y in the USA by FOAFOAFOAFOAF...  then actually you can
&gt; &gt; always connect any two people by a chain no longer than:
&gt; &gt; FOAFOAFOAF
&gt; 
&gt; Don't know if this applies but...this has been studied.  In a 
&gt; university somewhere.  I think it was sociologists.  They determined 
&gt; that if you took any two people in the country, at random, there are 
&gt; only five people between as friends.  This was an average.  I think it 
&gt; has been duplicated.  In other words, anyone of you could give me the 
&gt; name of someone you work with and I would ask a friend who has a 
&gt; connection to that city who might ask a friend who had the same line 
&gt; of work, etc. until someone knew that person.  It only takes five.  
&gt; Within the VW community I bet we could average less.  :)  I knew all 
&gt; that college would come in handy.  I'm also kinda fun at parties after
&gt; a few drinks.

I just learned about this theory recently, but the way it was told to me
was that you are only 6 connections away from anyone in the WORLD.

I think it just means you're an oaf.
