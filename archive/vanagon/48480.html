Subject: Free Camping book still available ?
Date: 19 Aug 96 07:19:49 PDT

We traveled for about 4 months in our '76 Riviera camper back in '84.
An in valuable resource we had was a book, that I think was titled 
&quot;Free Camping&quot; that listed as you would expect places that had free 
camping.  Listed small towns that had a small central park
(enticing one to eat and spend locally), community parks, forest 
service camps, etc.  After our trip I passed the book on to another 
fellow cheap traveller.  Anybody know if this book is still in print, 
available??  BTW spent on average of $5 per WEEK for camping,
mostly to get a shower.
