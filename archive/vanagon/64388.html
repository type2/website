Subject:      Re: FYI - Passenger door pocket

I've now mounted right side pockets on two vans.   My experience exactly
mirrored yours.    I said several resounding unprintable things, and then
repositioned it about 5&quot; back.

Incidently, an easy way to transfer the hole positions from the pocket to
the door is to cut the head off enough 6 penny nails to fill all the holes
points out, and then (once you've found the  correct place for the pocket
that doesn't interfere with the glove box), put them in the screw holes of
the pocket (they're blind holes), and press the pocket hard against the
upholstered side of the door panel to transfer.

For our new '90 Westy, I simply repeated the process - used the predrilled
holes, mounted the pocket, said unprintable things, and then remounted it.
 LIke one of my teachers said, I've got a great memory, but it's short...)
