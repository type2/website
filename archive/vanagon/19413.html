Subject: need bumper f/'72 bus

Hi all,
A friend of mine is looking for a rear bumper for a '72 bus and I told him
I'd do my best to help him out.  Apparently there was a change in bumpers
mid-year in '72.  the earlier one is the rounded bumper.  The other is more
squared.  He's looking for the rounded one.  Let me know if you have one,
what kind of condition it's in, and most important how much you want for it.
 I'll pass the info on to him.

Thanks
Sean Stueber
'63 kombi
'73 westy
