Subject: Re: 5 speed Vanagon

and i thought this would be a dead thread ...

my 5 speed starts with a clunk over to the left and back for first, then
second through fifth are in the usual H positions (where first through
fourth are on most other cars.)  Reverse is down, over left, and forward
(yes matthew, then i have to flick the g* little switch on the dash- grrrr.)

First is a real &quot;stump-puller&quot;, although the diesel will even let you start
in third gear if you slip the clutch a bit. I usually use all five,
unless im lazy, then i start in second and work from there.

isnt that dolly on her stomach ????????

sps
