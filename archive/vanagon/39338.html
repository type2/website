Subject: Re: 914 gearbox in bus

&gt;Can anyone tell me if it is possible to fit a Porsche 914 5-speed gearbox 
&gt;in a bay window bus with an upright motor?
&gt;
&gt;914s are as rare as hens teeth in Oz but I believe that there are plenty 
&gt;in the States. Can you get reconditioned 914 5-speed boxes and how much 
&gt;would they cost?

I imagine it would not be too much engineering involved to get the motor in
there.

You can get 901 (the model number, not the car number) tranny's rebuilt, but
not &quot;off the shelf&quot; like bug tranies.   There is also a 915 tranny, which is
almost the same, except 1st is at the top left of the H, not at the bottom left.
