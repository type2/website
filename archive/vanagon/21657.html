  OFFICE MEMO          Kelley vs. Edmund's                    Date:7/27/95

    I was looking at prices of used vans when Rhonda was looking at that $19k
'87 Vanagon Westy, and there is a big difference between the Edmund's prices
on their web-page and the Kelley blue-book price from my credit union. Rhonda
said the owner quoted $15.7k as the suggested retail price from Kelley. First
I looked on the web at Edmund's price. It said $8500 as suggested retail price
with AT/PS/PB. seems a little low. when I checked the Kelley price, sure
enough it was $15.7k, before the allowance for low mileage and extras beyond
PS/PB. 
    Most people who responded to Rhonda thought it was worth between $12 and
$13k, which seems about right. Why is Kelley so high, and Edmund's so low? and
how does someone like Rhonda talk sense into a seller who thinks they should
get the retail Kelley price? I know the retail price is what dealers want to
gouge you for, and if you buy from a private owner you should get a better
deal. but even the Kelley wholesale price was high, $10,550 before adding for
extras and low mileage.
    any thoughts?
