Subject: brakes again

Hi Everyone,

I apologize for being a pain about this brake thing, but I can't afford to
take it to a shop nor can I afford to by parts I may not need (master
cylinder??). I will try to describe the problem. The brake pedal on my 83
WB westy is mushy. If I play with the pedal it will sink to the floor. It
happens both with the engine on and with it off. When I'm driving I can
stop, but I have to double pump the pedal. When I stop at a light the pedal
sinks. Can someone please tell me if this is a master cylinder problem or
just air in the lines? I changed the clutch master and slave cylinders, but
I failed to bleed the brakes. I might as well change the master cylinder if
it is suspect so that I don't have to bleed the brakes twice. Any
information would be greatly appreciated.
