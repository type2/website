&gt; This reminds me of a older bus I saw (forgot if splittie or not) but it had

&gt; I liked it.

At the Manassas VW show several weeks ago I bought 2 stickers:

For the rear bumper of my '76 Camper:

     PASS ME, MAKE YOUR DAY

And for above the passenger side window crank:

     DO NOT LOWER WINDOWS AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 120 MPH


I've always wanted to get my own printed up:

     YOU TAILGATE, I BRAKE
