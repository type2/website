Subject: 'Fridge still on _at_ 14 days


T plus 14 days and counting.....

like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps going and going.  for those not 
familiar, i lit the fridge 2 weeks ago to the day just to see how 
long the dang thing would run.  it is terribly meaningful data in a 
chaotic world.

anyway, what is most interesting is that the fridge hasn't blown out 
in those 14 continuous days of daily driving.  i attribute this to a 
'tune-up' aka Derek's post and &quot;the butter dish fix&quot;.  yes, i'm 
driving around with a screaming yellow &quot;I Can't Believe It's Butter&quot; 
soft margarine spread food-type container half-shell screwed onto my 
fridge exhaust vent.  it ain't classy but if you look at it from a 
technical standpoint it is:

-noncorrosive
-resilient
-available
AND
-cheap!

so i think it is bea-u-tiful... :)
