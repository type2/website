By the time it reaches the kitchen counter, I've pretty much got it cleaned
up. It's just more comfortable there with a cup of coffee in one hand and the
shop maunal in the other. No place to sit in the garage--and no clean
counter--read:the garage is a mess! Barely have room for the van and the audi
hasn't been in in 2 months..

Thanks for the input. Guess I'll grease it up and throw it back on with lots
of new grease and new boot. Can't switch the front end joints(one one axle)
on the synchro and I don't want to switch sides because of the work. All the
joints were repacked a while back, so I'm not looking for more work right
now. The only reason this one's off is because the boot was wide open. 

One thing that impresses me is how rugged the suspension is on the front of
the synchro. Heavy components and very little rust/deterioration even for
NY's winter roads.
