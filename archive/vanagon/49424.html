As we all know, there are not many EV's out on the road.
But, there is one here at Loyola today, visiting.
As I walked by and was looking, I noticed how careful(not) this driver is:

The van's been in at least 3 accidents, and i didn't even see the rear.
It was hit pretty hard at the drivers door, it was hit at the 
drivers side rear and a panel fell off, and was side swiped at the 
sliding door...heavy rust at all the above spots.

The way things are going, by 1998 this van will be in a scrap yard
with so many bumps and bruises it will be almost unreconizable!
