Tony,
One thing that seems to be missing from your list is the distributor
wires that have a bad habit of wearing and shorting where they pass
through the distributor body. Just on chance, slip some electrical tape
between each wire and around the bunch to make sure that they're not
making contact with the housing or each other.

Last year, we were where you are today. Its a rite of passage. A zen
lesson in humility. A pain in the butt.

&gt; 
&gt; 1) checked and cleaned all the grounds
&gt; 2) checked the temp sensor (swapped with new to make sure)
&gt; 3) checked and cleaned the AFM (swapped with new to make sure)
&gt; 4) checked the ECU (swapped with new to make sure)
&gt; 5) checked all FI wiring
&gt; 6) checked for vacuum leaks
&gt; 7) checked fuel pressure
