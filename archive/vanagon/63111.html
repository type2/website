Subject:      Test plug on the alternator - 88 Vanagon

Can anyone tell me what the little round test plug with a rubber cap on it
attached to the back side of my alternator is for?  When you pear inside
the plug, there is a male fitting with 3 small pins.  I asked the VW
service advisor about it when I was there last week and he didn't have a
clue.
