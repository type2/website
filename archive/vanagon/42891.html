&gt;I need some help and I can't seem to find the right place to get it so
&gt;I'm asking for your help please. I am investigating the importing of a
&gt;Westfalia van from Alberta, Canada to Montana, USA. Will vans sold in
&gt;Canada from 1980 to 1990 meet US EPA and DOT standards for US
&gt;importation? Maybe you might know or direct me to someone who might.
&gt;Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide.

I looked into doing this a while back (1990?) and this is what I remember,
regarding later 86 &amp; newer models:  (I'm don't know how applicable this is to
older models)

The engine/emmissions are the same and can even be registered in California
after paying the out of state fee.  

The vehicles already have DOT approval stickers on them.

Trucks with beds (dual &amp; single cabe) and maybe panel vans are subject to the
25% (yes, twenty five percent) duty upon entry as commercial vehicles.

Passenger vans are subject to a 2.5% duty.

You'll likely need to change the speedo to a MPH type to import it.

You might need to change a few other small things like maybe lower power
headlight bulbs or something.

It may take 1 to 24 hours at the border depending on who is or isn't there
and whether they want to take responsibility for importing a car.

Additional stuff about the import duty:
You may get by with the 2.5% even on a dual or single cab if the customs
person doesn't realize there's a difference.  I know of at least one dual cab
imported with the lower 2.5% duty.
I think I remember hearing somewhere that the 25% commercial vehicle duty has
expired.  If so, you won't need to worry about the higher duty at all.

Call a U.S. Customs office and ask them to send you information about
importing vehicles from Canada.  When I called them a few years back, the
person I spoke to was suprisingly pleasant &amp; helpful for a government office.
 She sent me an envelope full of rules &amp; regulations.

Please let the list know what the current bottom line is on these imports if
you figure it out.

Good luck,
