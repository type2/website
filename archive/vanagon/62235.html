&gt; As I was about to leave, I recalled someone from the VintagVW 
&gt;  list mentioning the museum producing a &quot;formal birth certificate&quot;
&gt;  for 10 DM. I found the office, gave them 10 DMs and my serial 
&gt;  number (which has been committed to memory for over 20 years - 
&gt;  1226221). Late last week the birth certificate arrived. I thought
&gt;  I knew everything about my '56 by now, but the birth certificate
&gt;  held a new surprise. It seems my VW was delivered to San 
&gt;  Fransisco... 

How can we do this from the USA?  Where do we write?  How do we pay?  Can
this be done for any VW?

Thanks,
