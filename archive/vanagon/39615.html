Subject: Bus at the drive-in (sorta')

Okay, so this isn't really a bus at the drive in story, but I thought it 
appropriate as it still makes me chuckle.

I had a college friend who did concrete demolition work while going to 
school. To do his work he needed a means of hauling the broken up rock 
and concrete away. So, he bought an old dump truck. It was great to 
drive, but it made for even better drive-in movie parties.

We'd put 3 or 4 couches in this thing, go to the local drive-in (San 
Luis Obispo) and then from the back row of the drive in he'd slowly tilt 
the bed of the truck up to just the right angle so that all of us 
sitting on the couches could get a perfect view (all 16 of us). Ahh, 
youth.
