&gt;Hi All,

&gt;I'm still working on acquiring an 87 Syncro from a sorta nearby automotive
&gt;VoTech instructor.  He still states it is a 4 speed, no granny low etc.
&gt;Hmmm...,

Sounds fishy to me. All syncro trannys are 5 speed--four regular forward
gears and a granny low gear. Either he isn't aware of the granny gear or
somehow, the tranny has been altered. If it doesn't have this gear, I
wouldn't buy it.
