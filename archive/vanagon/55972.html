Subject: Bingo, got the part# AUDI engine support


Hello all,

After several e-mails, phone calls and faxes I received a FAX
from VW South Africa about the engine support for the AUDI 5 Cyl.
mounted in the Vanagon.

VW SA sells spare parts like that way Lionel wrote this for
VW Heritage in UK. They have a thick book with drawings with
page and short part number. You can order the parts with this
references at VW SA dealers, not at VW SA herself.

Now I got this one page with the engine mountings. The part
number (handwritten on this FAX) is 225 199 250 for the huge
black tube you see on my exhaust systems page at

http://www.relitech_dot_com/helmut/

VW SA promised me to send the whole catalog. If I receive this
(six to eight weeks delivery time expected) I'm able to give you
references to the questions in quad upper front grille etc.

I will have a nice weekend,
I like you to have same,
Helmut
'80 Camper
