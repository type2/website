Subject: Revell model info, another lead!


	Sorry folks, my informant forgot the info this morning. He
sent me his phone number so I could call him over the weekend if I
wanted- Transporter people on the Internet are THE nicest people!

	Anyway, I'll post what I get when I get it.

	Meanwhile, I'm going to look at a 70's single cab with
a blown engine this weekend- guy wants $1200 for it, it was working
until his friend belew it up on a cross-country to pick-up a 53
beetle in the Carolinas- friend got towed to the next town, installed
a rebuilt 1600 courtesy of VISA/MASTERCARD and kept on going, with
the original engine in the back! All this in August last year.
Now the owner is married, he'd rather have the money, and so the
vehicle is for sale.
	He says he's got all new NOS gates, professionally painted
to match, since he had started to do the fix-up himself.

	I figure an $800 rebuild from GEX would put it right back
on the road, so its a $2K single cab, with 12V from the factory,
shoulder belts, irs, dual circuit brakes. 

	Oh yeah, comes with a 71 front axle he got to put on
for disk brakes. Its not installed, but could be, I think, pretty
easily. Anyone done this?
