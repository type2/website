Subject: ASIAN: Fixed! VW Vanagon No Start - Floods

Hi group,

I subscribe to a technician's list and this has been kicking around for a
couple of days.  Thought that you all might be interested.  It also
illustrates the power of the net.

&gt;Greetings Techs!,
&gt;
&gt;        Ahhh.. it feels good when you put a 600$ plus part in and it works! :)
&gt;
&gt;        Thanx Greg Caron! Greg hit it pretty much right on the head. And thanx
&gt;Jim Arnott!  for the valuable information he sent,  and thanx to others
&gt;that responded with other excellent checks.   I'd *thought* I'd checked
&gt;the injectors ok with my noid light, but, (Yep, Hehehe) after getting
&gt;Greg's message I thought I'd try measuring the pulse width on crank.
&gt;None!.  (Guess that's what I get for doing my own thinking at times. :)
&gt;To make a long story short,  I pulled an injector bank,  and had a
&gt;helper crank it,  and my, my,  we have a solid &quot;powerfull&quot; stream of
&gt;fuel here! &lt;Howl!&gt;  ECU was grounding the injectors wide open.  Replaced
&gt;ECU, and she started right up.  What I'm gathering why this happened
&gt;when the customer ran out of gas,  was the shiny new battery in the
&gt;van,  that I later find out needed a jump start after extended
&gt;cranking,  so I assume somehow he knocked out the ecu. I'm still a bit
&gt;leary on the air flow meter,  with the resistence changes,  but customer
&gt;is happy with what he's got so we'll see him later on that.  Also,
&gt;Changed the oil,  and let the muffler dry out.  Got so bad it eventually
&gt;came running out the tail pipe! &lt;Howl!&gt;.  Jeez,  think I might have a
&gt;clue about then huh? :)  Thanx a million guys.  Sure hope to pay back
&gt;the help.  Have a great one.  Thanx Brent!

&gt;&lt;--- ORIGINAL POST:---&gt;
&gt;Greetings techs,  and Happy Holidays!
&gt;
&gt;Hoping one of you fine VW Men might be able to steer me in the proper
&gt;direction here.  1987 Vw Vanagon with the Digifant (Bosch Afc) Gas
&gt;Injection System.
&gt;Vehicle was brought in on the hook with a no start.  Customer said he
&gt;ran out of gas with it,  and put a couple of gallons in,  but didn't
&gt;help.
&gt;
&gt;What's happening is the engine is flooding big time.  After a short
&gt;crank time (5 to 10 sec) pull the plugs and they are soaked.
&gt;
&gt;Remove Inj. Connectors and will run fine on propane.
&gt;Fuel pressure - Ok
&gt;Coolant temp good. - 4200ohms at 45degrees
&gt;Throttle valve switch - Ok.
&gt;Injector resistence good on all 4 - 15.8 to 15.9 ohms.
&gt;Intake air temp sensor - Ok.
&gt;Power good to all injectors and will pulse noid night on crank.
&gt;
&gt;The air flow meter is what I'm a bit confused with.  Mitchell isn't
&gt;reall clear on the testing of it,  and I just don't work on enough of
&gt;these beasties to know what is good and what isn't.  Resistence between
&gt;pins 1 &amp; 2 with flapper closed is 4.0k Ohms,  and as flapper is opened
&gt;resistence starts moving up slowly and at 1/4 open is about 6.01K, now
&gt;as it moves farther is drops to under 5.0K then starts back up with full
&gt;open at 4.56K Ohms.  This can't be right can it?  Is there a proper way
&gt;to test this?
&gt;
&gt;Could I also have another problem that I'm not checking?
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions or comments are much appreciated.
