My '72 (Build date 6 June 1972) has '73 style front turn signals.

&gt;Yell if this is wrong.  The '72 shares the front brakes with my '71 so
&gt;I keep my eyes open for them.  Calipers and disks for these are tres

Yes, the '71 and '72 share the same front brakes and they fit no other year.
 Makes me wish that when I had the '73 for parts that I had taken the
spindles, rotors, and calipers off when I took the engine.
