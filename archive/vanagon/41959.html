Subject: EGR on 1978 2.0L engine questions

  I'm in the process of getting my vehicle registration renewed.
Since I have swapped in a newer engine, the State of Calif requires
an inspection.  The inspector has failed my vehicle because he
believes that the EGR system is malfunctioning.

Failing the Test:
  The test procedure that the inspector is using goes as follows:
Warm up the engine, let it idle and remove the EGR valve pushrod
from the throttle positioner.  By moving the pushrod back and forth
the EGR valve opens and closes.  When the valve opens it allows
exhaust vapors to enter the air box.  The idle is supposed to stumble
and the engine stall.
My engine idle does not stumble or stall.  

Maintenance:
I've cleaned out the pipes with a wire hangar, blown air through the 
EGR filter, cleaned and inspected the EGR valve and sealed all the
flanges using muffler gasket goop.  I know that exhaust IS flowing 
through the system as I can feel it with my finger when one of the 
pipe flanges is temporarily disconnected.

Questions:
Is the inspector's test procedure correct?

Is there an alternate test that can be performed to prove that EGR is
functional?  (I suggested hooking the car up to the exhaust gas analyzer
during the EGR test.)

My original '73 motor had a &quot;smog pump&quot; and the '78 does not.  It must
rely on manifold pressure to run the system.  Perhaps on the '78 engine
there is not enough volume of exhaust to stall the engine at idle - when
manifold pressures are relatively low?  (my theory)

Should I schedule any further inspections with an inspector in a
differant city?  (2nd doctor's opinion)


I need help from the V_at_L brain trust.  Any comments, email is fine:
