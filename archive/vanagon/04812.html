Subject: Re:  About that sunroof....
Date: Fri, 30 Sep 94 16:50:58 PDT

Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr....This is bugging me..............

I have this _hole_ in the roof...It currently has a stock metal sliding
sunroof in it. My VW mechanic has a &quot;sporTop&quot; over the drivers and 
passenger's seat. It is exactly like what I want - only it is toooooo
small.

Does anyone know where these tops are made? If I can find the Mfg of 
thses &quot;T&quot; tops I can probably make one out of the parts...fits the
curve of the roof, has hinges and latches ... etc...

Help me VanList! I know we can do this!
Help!
