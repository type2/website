1. Can PROPYLENE Glycol be used in a Vanagon instead of of ETHYLENE Glycol?
 2. Does VW have any official stance on this? 
3. Does anyone on the list have any experience with this product?

Thanks in advance for the information.

The key, in my opinion, is the lack (for whatever reason) of phosphates.  
Ethylene/propylene glycol provide the heat exchange fluid, just like water 
would, and some additional additives (about 5% of the total volume) provide 
the real corrosion protection.  The glycol is just the fluid, with fewer of 
the problems that water has (corrrosion-wise).  Water, in fact, is a better 
heat exchange fluid, but problematic; it boils, evaoprates, and corrodes 
things; glycols do these things as well, but at higher tempratures, lower 
rates, and lesser amounts respectivly.

I really don't understand the need to keep the phosphates out of the system, 
but it does seem to be a requirement, and has been so since at least 1989 
when my 1990 VW Vanagon was manufactured (!).  Having spent some small 
amount of time as a professional mechanic, I cannot recall even seeing 
phosphate free coolant availible until....well, time came to change my VW 
coolant.  Even then, I had to look around, and pay a premium.

I would not object to refilling with the propylene glycol, provided it is in 
fact &quot;phosphate free&quot;
