Subject:       Fridolin redux

Another article that wouldn't post last week:

Found a great article on the Fridolin on pp. 44-46 of the April 88 
Dumb Bunnies and Not VWs, FYI.
&gt;From the article:
issued in mustard yellow (the one shown is dark green)
designed and built for the Bundespost, 64-73
some also sold to Swiss post office
type 147
over 700 built
Ghia chassis! (width)
1200cc/40hp
unlike the lush Beetle dash, this one only had a speedo
bus taillights and narrowed bus rear bumper
dual sliding doors
most had Eberspacher heaters
built by Westfalia!
passenger seat folds forward and pivots to the side for access
