Subject: Re: Correct idle speed for 60's engine?

go with Muir.  550 just sounds insanely low.  You could also check the
engine compartment sticker and see what that says.  Actually, Muirs idea of
turning the idle up until it just turns of the generator light is probably
the best.

&gt;Muir quotes the correct idle speed as 850 rpm.
&gt;
&gt;My owner's manual says 550 rpm.
&gt;
&gt;What do you people think?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
