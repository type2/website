	Well, tonight I got the passenger side cab floor panel put in.
It took a bit of pursuasion and dimensional adjustment (banging and cutting)
to get it to fit.

	Its all welded in and painted - no more flintstone-mobile on the 
passenger side!

	Now to put the driver side in (maybe tomorrow) which will be a bit 
more diffucult - those pesky pedals!

	NEW TOYS!
	
	I bought an air-powered die grinder and a small wire wheel for it.
Beats the living socks off the electric drill!  Wind this puppy up and
touch it to the body and the paint is GONE!  Wheeew!
