Rick -
Know nothing about VW ATF, and little about my Ford's ATF, but I 
never found another way to get fluid into AT other than through 
dipstick hole, which should be larger that oil's.  Buy one of those 
funny funnels at a FLAPS, long, big at one end and real small at the 
other, and go slowly and keep checking level.

The window knob on my '80 (probably the same) was also loose.  Pry 
loose the plastic cover and remove via a phillips.  You'll find the 
backside of the knob has been riveted on, not screwed.  My handle 
broke, so I had to replace, you may be able to re-press/shape/form 
rivet on yours.  Let me know results, as my other one is loose.

I used a standard old fashioned rubber stopper to replace missing one 
on one bus.  The other bus is like yours, locked with no key, keep me 
posted on solution.

&gt; Also, wondering if anyone has a handy trick for tightening the window 
&gt; handles, they are loose and the screw behind the knob is difficult to 
&gt; get around behind to, (just the knob on the handle is loose, not the 
&gt; handle itself.) Also, the key to the water tank under the third flip 
&gt; cap (city water?) is missing, will I have to buy a new unit? I'm 
&gt; already replacing the flip top cap covers for this one and the 
&gt; electrical hookup for about 35 bucks apiece. Thanks for any advice,
