Bill Kennedy asks:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm especially
&gt; interested in items like cutting off the rain gutters at the edge of the wind-
&gt; shield, adding the $79 spoiler that JCWitless sells, adding 2-in. wide &quot;ears&quot;
&gt; at the air intakes for better engine cooling, converting to or from FI, in-
&gt; creasing or decreasing tire pressures, fiberglasing in the grill (*top* grill
&gt; for you waterpumpers), lowering the ride height.

A long time ago, there was a thread about how you could convert a snub-nosed
air-pusher like our vans into a sleek TGV/Bullet Train aerodynamic wonder.

Someone posted that you could take a cone of suitable size, put it on
a pole of suitable length, and stick it to the front of the van (like
the knights of old).  This gives the same drag coefficient as a solid
mass of the same length, but with a nice bullet nose.  I'm pretty
sure there's even some scanned photos of drawings of someone's research
that &quot;proved&quot; that putting a more rounded nose on a bus drops its coefficient
of drag dramatically on the vanagon web homepage. 

Anyway, lately I've been thinking about putting that pole with a plate
or cone on the end on my van's nose, and see how fast I can go.  Right now,
wind drag increases as I approach 90mph.  I don't think I've been above
90 (maybe on a downhill?)
