Subject: So far so good.......(more elctronics for the van)

Well this weekend ended up being a couple days of additional wiring on 
the Westy.  Finally got around to finishing the amp and speaker setup 
for the back and installing the reading lights (swivel heads and all)in 
the read overhead cabinet.

Heres my question.  Whats the best way to hook my spare battery into the 
charging system?  Via isolator or just do like the marine applications 
do and install a A/B/C switch so only one battery is getting charged at 
a time? 

Also, how about running multiple batteries in parallel.  Can the 
alternator handle recharging upwards of 3 batteries after a rather 
lengthy drain down period?
