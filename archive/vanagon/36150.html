Subject: Corona de Tucson Jamboree (report)



This last weekend, the Arizona Bus Club sponsored a bus
caravan and campout called the Corona de Tucson Jamboree.
This was the first of what they hope will be many such events.

This event started at 7 AM Saturday morning in Phoenix where
approximately 35 busses, mostly 1967 and earlier, met and caravened
down I-10 to a VFW post in the small town of Corona de Tucson, south
of Tucson.  They spent the night, camping, and then split up Sunday
afternoon for the return trip to phoenix.

While at the camp site, there was a car show (judged by VFW members!),
a swap meet (although there wasn't much to swap!), and general good
times.  Saturday night the VFW post put on a steak dinner and Sunday
morning they had a breakfast.

Myself, I went out Saturday afternoon to take a look at the swap meet
and to see what was going on.  After I talked to a few people I
discovered that the guy with most of the parts to swap wasn't there
yet but would probably be down tomorrow (Sunday).  After looking at
all the busses (lots of crew cabs!) and talking for a while I went on
home with plans to return in the morning when there would be a better
chance to find the rear bumper for my '66 I'm looking for.

Next day I drove on out again, only to find that the 'parts guy'
never showed up.  Oh well...  So I joined some of the club officers
around the breakfast table. (The two elderly woman serving breakfast
seemed a little overwhelmed by the overabundance of customers!)

The AZ bus club people said that one of the reasons for this event
is to get more members from Tucson (they did, I joined as member 209
this morning.)  I said that I would be interested in possibly helping
start a Tucson chapter of the club but that I would need some help.
I haven't thought much more about this yet but I did meet another
Tucson person there (with a '61 single cab) who said he would also
be willing to help.

I had a specially good time talking to all the owners of crew cab busses
(all split window) because, eventually, I would like to own one of
those.  There were a few teens in 'way rad' slammed bugs with megawatt
stereos, but they were, thank goodness, in the extreme minority.

I heard that they had quite a bit of wind late Saturday night but the
beautiful desert setting more than made up for the weather.  I would
say this new event was a success.

I stayed for the raffle and then left during the car show awards, I
had to get back to my task of rubbing out my '73 westy so it will
look nice when I sell it.

I can answer questions anyone has about this event and the Az Bus Club
when I get back from a business trip on Wednesday.

Cheers,
