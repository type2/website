Subject: Pizzas and Bodyshops 

&gt;The big blue thing started first time even though Galvo parked 
it under a tree that held every incontinent bird
&gt;in Ennis.

Not true - I disavow (lovely word that) all knowledge. It spend 
most of the three weeks at Michael Clancy's Body Beautiful shop 
for Bended Busses (Motto: Ubendum we mendum)
so it was every bird in Lissycasey that shat on the van.

&gt;body-shop man.  Dunno how much it's gonna cost yet, 'coz &gt;I've 
not rung him.  Extended credit, doncha know.  :)

Don't worry - remember that quantity discount?

&gt;Last thing - after reading tonnes of stuff about you people
&gt;meeting all over the place, I suggest that all the Irish
&gt;Vanagonoldiers (nice word, huh?) should meet next Friday 
&gt;night at 9pm at Numero Uno for a pizza.  That Ok with you, 
&gt;Galvo?  ;)

That sounds fine n' dandy. I'll put that in my Lotus Organiser 
and you you put that in your Works for OS/2.


Galvo
