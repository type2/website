Subject: Re: vw parts microfiche ... anybody want one?

Which reminds me.... I was up at a dealership last week (which means I was
*real* desperate for the part).. They didn't use a microfiche - they had
it all on a 386!! I WANT THE SOFTWARE!! It would be sooooo cool! I could
look up my own parts, etc. Any tips / suggestions are greatly appreciated!!

Jamie
