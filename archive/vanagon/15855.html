Cheap places to camp:

WAL-MART parking lots (yes, it's true.  good last ditch option, with 
security and washrooms close by).  The $3.96 Rand McNally W-M atlas 
somebody mentioned the other day has a W-M store directory.  Veeery handy!
BTW, I'm talking about crashing out discreetly in the car, not setting up 
the lawn chairs and firing up the barbeque...

Sleeps available _legally_ at Interstate rest areas in AR, FL?, NJ?, OK, 
RI?, SD, Conn, maybe some others...  Again, this is just &quot;overnight 
parking&quot;, often in &quot;emergencies only&quot;, but pull your rotor if you think 
the cops might hassle you.  (See?  won't start!)

In CA, try the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) sites.  Lots of areas in 
the desert, nice and quiet.  

The Army Corps of Engineers has some neat sites by reservoirs, and these 
are often free of very cheap.

Discreet parking on any old backroad.

Try the book: &quot;Don Wright's guide to free campgrounds&quot; Cottage Publ. 
(219) 875-8618  ISBN 0-937877-11-5.  Lots of info, but sometimes 
vague-to-the-point-of-useless or just plain incorrect information.  Worth 
stealing, and possibly buying.  Ask around at RV stores if they have 
copies available for theft.
