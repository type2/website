Subject: yesterday's papers...

	The Big Sur campout was fabulous and it was wonderful to
meet everyone in person. Next time I'll have my pickup truck and 
I really WILL have to sleep in a tent! We *feasted*, and Jeff taught 
a bunch of us how to play  Hacky Sack, which I got really into. 
I was really sorry I had to go home early. But its better to have
gone and left early than to have never gone at all.

	Everyone's Vanagon, Bus or Transporter looked cool. I
particularly liked the psychedelic effect of Tobin and Krista's
yellow breadloaf with the deep-green interior pannels. SOMEBODY
inhaled something back at the color studios...

	Ok, time to fess-up: When I got home, I went to shoot the
last frames and take my film down to be processed, and guess what?
NO FILM IN MY CAMERA!! OH NO :-((((((((((((((
	I don't think I've ever done that before, and boy do I
feel foolish!
	So I'll just have to wait for Krista and Tobin's roll to be
developed. And I'll check better next time. Sheesh. I HAD a roll in
my bag, but apparently wound and shot a few 'blanks' after I closed
the body last time I took film out, so when I picked it up, it
was on frame &quot;3&quot; and I thought, &quot;Oh, there must be another roll in it...&quot;

	I vote for March 17-19 for the next camp-out because I'm already 
booked on a flight to Phoenix for the air races and the Blue Angels
on the weekend of the 24th-26th. So naturally I'd do better with
a closer to Bay Area site than a further away one.
