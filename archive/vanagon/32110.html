The latest cookie garbage was truly a spam by someone NOT on the vanagon 
list. An addition to the welcome message would not have helped.

I am not prepared for the filtering that's going to have to go on on this
list to prevent this kind of stuff.  I know how to do it, but haven't
gotten around to it.  For a while anyway, could you just try to ignore it. 
I'll work on it, k? 

Thanks.
