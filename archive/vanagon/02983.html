&gt;&gt;I just want to second what Jan says about 5w50 syntech.  It definitely is
&gt;&gt;the best oil I have run.  I have had it in my 2.0 for over 2500 miles and
it
&gt;&gt;is still not dark but looks just like how it looked when I poured it in -
with
&gt;&gt;the exception that it is a slight bit browner.  There has been no
consumption
&gt;&gt;at all on my car either - mileage has been good, and I bet part of it has
been
&gt;&gt;due to this oil.

&gt;	Ok, Peter (and Jan, and anyone else using Syntec) can you be a little
more specific on
&gt;why you liked the Syntec so much? Any opinions are welcome, subjective or
otherwise.

It's probably more than subjective because it was quite noticable in my
G60: When you start in the morning with a cold engine, the engine
&quot;feels&quot; warmed up, less &quot;sluggish&quot; when you accelerate.
In fact, there is little difference between a warm or a cold engine
in the way it responds, except which can be contributed to a cold fuel
system (5th inj, air cold ==&gt; inefficient air fuel mix/freezing).

When warm, the car feels peppier as well, easier to get up to speed.

Some have reported that the car slows down less when you take your
foot off the gas.
I did not notice anything like that though.

&gt;I mean the fact that it doesn't get black would also be a minus (less
effective detergent package),
&gt;and little or no oil consumption could mean that it's too thick to pass
through valves and
&gt;rings (thus less lubrication?)

It will turn rather dark after a while, but it seems to take longer.
Also the reduced consumption may have been purely coincidental with
my engine finally being worn in after 30k miles....
However, others have reported similar effects with (other) synthetics
in older engines.

I am not sure what all this means, less break down, better sealing for
the rings, less detergents?
And I don't think this stuff is too thick, it's about as fluid as
water (vs thick maple sirup for regular oils), which did make me a 
bit worried. 
I am most worried about the G60 bearing...the G60 spins really fast
and it uses engine oil pressure for lubrication.

Whether it is really protecting the engine better, naturally I cannot
tell you, I have not done an analysis of the oil.

However, my friend in Europe who races his very expensive 944 Turbo &quot;S&quot;
only uses Castrol Syntec (called &quot;RS&quot; over there), same as the other
members of his Porsche club. 
So I figured, it can't be too bad.
With Synthetics, I almost feel comfortable changing the oil at the
recommended interval of 7500 miles (which is what Castrol themselves
recommended for &quot;normal&quot;
duty!)
