&gt;OK, I haven't thrown anything out for a Friday for a while, so....

so what else is new? my house is cluttered with Fridays!!! :) just ask
Richard and his crew. :)

&gt;What are the best/funniest/most bizarre VW meet awards people have
&gt;seem/heard about/fantisized about?  You know, every meet seems to have
&gt;awards for stuff like
&gt;&quot;Longest distance driven&quot;

well ... i drove from Montgomery, AL to Lawrence, KS once ... in one fell
swoop. i think it was 19 hours. don't know how far it is, but it's a looooong
way across Kansas!

&gt;&quot;Best restoration&quot;

... there was this friend of mine in high school, and his mother got some
plastic surgery done ... nice. REAL nice. :)

&gt;&quot;Most in need of restoration&quot;

then there was this other friend ...

&gt;&quot;Interior remodelling most likely done under influence of really weird drugs&quot;

for sale, in Prattville, AL: 1988 VW Vanagon GL. silver-bronze exterior.
RED VELOUR INTERIOR. the whole thing. dash, floor, seats, headliner, walls,
EVERYTHING was red velour. it looked like it had been done by the absolutely
WORST group of people who ever tried to do interior work. or the drunkest.

&gt;&quot;Most impressive display of ground clearance&quot;

... you mean, while sitting still?? or does &quot;airborne&quot; count?? :)

&gt;&quot;Most times dropping engine during meet&quot;

hmmmmm. never dropped an engine. hurts my toes, don't you know.

how about &quot;Most Number of Space Shuttle Landing Lights on the Front of Any
Bus&quot;???? :)
