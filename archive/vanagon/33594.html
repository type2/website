Subject: Re: cleaning greasy/grimy parts ...

&gt;you must use some lye-like chemical, Oven Cleaner is (I think) the same 
&gt;thing, in a somewhat less obnoxious/hazardous vehicle.  The same warnings 


The oven cleaner method was also rec'd by the Porsche ListMeister, to get 
engine or trans cases clean and shiny, lots of scrubbing to assist the 
process. This was following a regular degreasing I think.    Tim
