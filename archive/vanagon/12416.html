&gt;Let me be boring for a minute (times up, houg).
&gt;
&gt;I doubt we will come to a consensus re: sticker-ology.  And as The
&gt;Ontario-an (new show coming out this fall?) said, many of us will
&gt;likely never see another list member.  How about this--

We haven't had enough time to even start to build a consensus, be patient.
And whether or not we will ever see a sticker is IMHO ultimately not the
point.  I think it would be a real &quot;gas&quot; to someday see a vanagon go flying
by my slow boat with a sticker on it.  Who knows when that would happen?
Don't care...
