Subject:      88 keys

well ... i just called those to 800 numbers (for my own curiosity) ...

Ellis was sure they could order the blanks, but he said he'd have to wait
until Monday to do it.

Camelback said they had them, but they were $16.00 EACH!!!!! :(  he said
they were getting harder and harder to find, and had gone up in price
twice in the last year.

there is NO excuse for that kind of treatment from VW!!! that's ridiculous.

check a large local key shop and see what they say ... it's NOT that strange
a key blank (looks like a BMW key to me) and they (the kep shop) should be
a helluva lot less than $16.00 each.
