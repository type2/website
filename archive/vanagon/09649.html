&gt; My vote for those of in the Southeast is any where in Eastern North 
&gt; Carolina of Western Tennessee.  I think this could cover a reasonable 
&gt; area from Northern Virginia to Tuscaloosa County, Alabama really well.  
&gt; Maybe the Eastern Tenn option would be good for Joel.  I hear Fall Creek 
&gt; Falls near Manchester, Tenn is really nice.  My tenants, a 
&gt; Geologist/Hydrologist married couple go there every year for some kind of 
&gt; rocks bash.--

&gt; And all the puppets in this digital jail / They're runnin' around in a frenzy
&gt; In search of the Holy Grail. /
&gt; They're havin' virtual sex. / They're eatin' virtual food.
&gt; No wonder these puppets are always in a lousy mood.
