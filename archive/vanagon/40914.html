Subject: bullets on a 1961

&gt;There seems to be some question about whether bullets existed in the
&gt;1961 model year.

I have bullet indicators on my 1961 split: 739175. I heard, though don't
recall the source,  that the bullet indicators continued  until 1964, on
some european models. The  American export model being one of the first to
move over to the fish eye indicator.
