]having watched all those comments fly by, i thought i'd put out a few of
]my own:
]
]i don't think a reworked/update Vanagon would go well in the u.s.  i think
]it is a problem with Volkswagen as a company ... i think that basically they
](the company) have lost touch with the u.s. market, and, because of problems
]with personnel in dealerships (salespeople who didn't know the products or
]the history of the company; service people who were not trained on vw cars
]and especially buses; parts people who don't know what they are doing), VW
]lose the confidence of the volkswagen-buying public. imho.

While I don't agree entirely with Joel's statement about an updated Vanagon,
I certainly agree with the rest.

]the Vanagon had several 'faults' as a van for america:
]* you had to climb up into the vehicle. i've had just about every female that
]  ever rode in my bus complain about that. even the step up into the sliding
]  door is higher than they want it to be. note that it is NOT higher than,
]  say, a Chevy Astro (which, in my opinion, is a large, lumbering Truck!),
]  but it is high.

My wife has complained about this, too, but then she'd rather drive a
Honda Civic.  While this puts off some customers, sitting high is a
feature to others.  I think it's a matter of knowing what your targeted
market wants and doing that.  If VW thinks they can sell head-on against
the Chrysler minivan juggernaut, I'd like to know what they're smoking.

]* there is no 'nose' on the vehicle, by which the driver (or especially the
]  passenger) gauges just how soon impending doom would arrive.  my mother
]  would try to mash her feet through the floor when i pulled into a parking
]  place with a meter or wall ... she was certain that i was going to hit it.
]  never did.  this lack of nose also contributes to the 'unsafe' opinion
]  about Vanagons. after some of the wrecks i've seen involving american iron
]  in which the engine moved back into the front seat, i'm not so sure that
]  a front engine is safer.

I agree with every bit of this.  I must admit to getting a certain sadistic 
pleasure from some of the reactions I get from people who are first-time
bus riders.  I still rather think this appeals to some folks while putting
others off.

]* the front seats are directly over the front wheels. this gives a strange
]  feeling to one's butt when one slams on the brakes. :)  you don't get this
]  in a 'regular' car or chrysler minivan.

I guess I don't quite understand this one, and have never had anyone
comment on it, either.

]* it doesn't fit into most american garages very well. or automatic car
]  washes at the gas station.

It fits MY garage just fine.  It only take up about the same floor space
as a Honda Accord, so you must be referring to the height, but it's fit
in every garage I've owned without hitting.  I know Westphalias are a
different problem, though.  I take my Vanagon through the same car wash
my wife uses for the Honda.

]the chrysler mini-van, imho, sold so well BECAUSE it was nearly a car. but
]also because it was NOT a station wagon ... which had a reputation of Huge
]Hard-to-Park Housewife Hardships. and Yuppie-moms didn't want that.  the
]chrysler mini-van was also light and basically nimble on its feet (as opposed
]to the Astro and Aerstar ... both large and somewhat ponderous in nature).
]it also fits easily into garages and goes through car washes with no problems.

I agree with this, but still question the wisdom of trying to compete
with the Chrysler minvan head-on.  GM tried with the TransSport with
only minimal success, and they have a huge dealership net.  What makes
anyone think VW can do it with the EuroVan (which isn't as low or as
carlike as the Chrysler)?

]Aside: what amazes me is that Chevy and Ford took TEN years to even try to
]come up with competition for the Voyager/Caravan. it's like they didn't
]really believe it was selling that well.

I think they thought it was a fad that would fade.  Boy were THEY wrong!

]i personally think the Vanagon has more 'style' ... whatever 'style' is ...
]than the Eurovan.  the Eurovan, to me, is a combination of the chrysler mini-
]van and the chevy astro. it's too large to compete with the chrysler and
]costs too much to compete with the chevy.

Again, I agree with all of that.

]i think one of the things to remember here is that vw bus people have always
]been a little bit out of the 'mainstream' of american (european/u.k. as well?)
]culture.  have you folks ever noticed that other people (who don't have vw
]buses/vanagons) will ask you 'Why do you drive that thing'?

I can relate.  I get even more people asking me why my PRIMARY transpor-
tation has been a motorcycle for the past 30 years.

]now, i've been driving vw's since 1958, and have been driving vw buses since
]since 1970, so i will admit to a great deal of bias here. or habit, if you
]want to call it that. but i've driven other vans ... dodge, chevy, ford ...
]on long trips, and even with the uncomfortable-after-two-hours seats in the
]'bread-loaf' buses, i'd still rather have a vw bus. i just don't like the
]engine between next to my right leg. and riding in the front passenger seat
]is worse.  the chrysler mini-van, to me, is much better than its big brothers,
]but it has no 'personality' ... i don't know of any other way to describe it.
]maybe it's all the plastic inside.
]
]and that's the way the Eurovan strikes me: no 'personality'. and the wheel-
]well makes my left leg uncomfortable.  and i kept hitting my head getting
]into the driver's seat.

I'm not quite sure how to respond to the &quot;personality&quot; issue, since that
is an entirely personal thing.  The EuroVan does seem rather more generic
than the Vanagon, if that's what you mean.

]but that's ME ... and i'm not everybody. i can see a lot of things about the
]eurovan for people to like. i can see a lot of things about the chrysler
]mini-vans for other people to like. my sister has one. five people here at
]work have one. but we have a chevy astro as a work truck here ... and i can't
]see anything about it that i think is likeable.  haven't tried the new big
]dodge vans yet, but i suspect they are the same as before, with only a outer
]sheet metal change.

Yes, the new Dodge full-size van is just new sheetmetal on the old vehicle.
The new (new a couple of years ago, anyway) Ford van shares a lot with its
predecessor, too, but is more of a new design than the Dodge.  GM doesn't
even make any pretense of redesigning their big van; I guess they figure
plumbers won't care, anyway.

]so why, with all the aggrevation and heart-ache with the water-boxer engine
]and my very low opinion of dealer service departments, do i keep driving
]vanagons? and why do i want another second one? and why do i want a double-
]cab vanagon pickup truck?  because i have found that the design fits my idea
]of a van almost exactly: there are very few things i would change about the
]vanagon to make it 'perfect'. i really like it's design. i feel 'comfortable'
]in it.  and i think that is what is important with a car.

Bingo!
