&gt; &gt; proposed on net was to replace the motor with an one of the automatic
&gt; &gt; transmission versions, which are self supporting.  A friend of my 
&gt; &gt; father's turned out to have a working ATR starter motor among his spares, 
&gt; &gt; so I tried this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Result:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Don't do it.  The gear on the ATR starter motor does not extend as far as 
&gt; &gt; the the manual trans version. and does not engage the flywheel. Oh, well, 
&gt; &gt; back to the hill.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have one of these starters on my '68 Westy.  Had one on my '73 Ghia.  
&gt; Never had any problems with not engaging the flywheel.
&gt; 
&gt; What's going on here?

I dunno, this was specific to my '78.  Maybe the bell housing/flywheel are
different on the 2L engine? All I know is that the motor spun merrily but
no cranking occurred.  Pulled the ATR motor and laid it beside the manual
motor.  The gear (at rest) on the manual motor stuck out about 3/4&quot; 
more than the gear on the ATR motor.  Now I regret not having worked and
measured both solenoids (it occurred to me that the solenoid not working
would have the same effect, but since, on VW starters, the solenoid popping
is what connects the motor I didn't bother.  Oh, well bad, experimental 
procedure.
