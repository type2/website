Subject: Re: Hard Shifting..sometimes

&gt;    Since acquiring her, Ramona has always displayed hard shifting from time
&gt;to time. Sometimes, she's smooth, and sometimes I can't even downshift from
&gt;3rd to 2nd. She just won't go. I've had the trans gear oil
&gt;checked/drained/replaced, but that didn't make a difference. My question is
&gt;this: when I have the engine out and her guts exposed, how do I check on
this
&gt;problem? What do I look for? Is it something that I can check before
removing
&gt;the engine? Any ideas or similar fiascos? Y'know, she doesn't pop out of
gear
&gt;ever, but this thing with the tuff shifting is getting me all worried.

I have the exact same problem with mine.  The problem is with 2nd gear just
like yours.  Mine was a little rough to get into 2nd when I bought it, but
it's gotten progressively worse.  Now it's to the point where I'm the only
one that can drive it because no one but me can get it into 2nd AT ALL.  It
doesn't really bother me because I can shift it just fine, but if I ever
wanted to let someone else drive it they wouldn't be able to without about a
half hour lesson on how to shift the beast.  My trans doesn't slip out of any
gears and sounds great so I don't think there are any problems with it.  I've
also put a new clutch and pilot bearing in recently and it didn't help a bit.
 (By the way, if you ever have your engine out for any reason at all, take
the time to put in a new pilot bearing.  It takes about two minutes and about
five bucks and is well worth it.  That little thing can cause you a lot of
problems if it ever goes out on you at the wrong time.)
