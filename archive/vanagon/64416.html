&gt;         According to my VW owners manual it says to never push start the

&gt; option in an emergancy but they claim it will damage the CAT.  Would it be
&gt; so bad once in a while if needed?

i have push started my vanagon hundreds of times with no ill effects on
either side of the steering wheel.

BTW:my dad drives a manual tranny jeep, and my mom
drives a manual tranny subaru, and both those owners manuals say the same
thing.

coincedence?
i don't think so!
a AAA conspiracy?
DEFINATELY!
