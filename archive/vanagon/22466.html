Subject: RE: WTB: 2/3 front bench seat for 71 Bus

&gt;???... a 2/3 front seat in a walk-thru?

Well, the '68 crew cab has a 1/3, 2/3 front seat in it and it is a little 
different - obviously not a walk thru.  The driver's seat appears to be like 
all of the regular bus seats - has the back angle adjustment, etc.  The 2/3 
part, which goes over the spare tire, is basically just an extended regular 
passenger seat.  It appears to use the same lower brackets, and had two 
instead of one of the brackets that hook on the seat back upper frame.  
Comes out the same, by lifting the lower part until it folds and unhooks 
from the top, then lifts out.

I have thought of trying to put a bench in the front of the '73 w/ walk 
thru.  Decided against it, but think it can be done if you can find one of 
the 4-across center seats.  I think that with careful modification of the 
lower frame, i.e. removing the legs, it would fit across the front.

FWIW,
