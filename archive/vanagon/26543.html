Subject: Help Replacing the stereo in bus

Hi all,
I finally broke down and bought a new stereo for my '77 westy to relace the
circa 1978 craig that is in there now. The folks at Best Buy wanted to
install it for free but no way am I going to let them mess with the wiring
etc. Figure it can't be that difficult.
I can't begin to figure out how to get the old one out, I took the face
plate and all the knobs off thinking it would just pop out, connect the old
wires to the new unit, put the speakers in where the old ones are bam 20
minutes and I am out of there. My bus has the factory air cinditioning unit
under the dash and this effectively blocks working from underneath, should I
go thru the glove box? And if so how do you remove it, I unscrewed the door
thinking (I am probably doing to much thinking) that the glove box would be
easy to pop out but no...
So any thoughts you have will be much appreaciated.
Peace,       &quot;Now shake it, shake it Sugaree, I'll meet you at the jubilee,
Scoob         and if that jubilee don't come, maybe I'll meet you on the run&quot;
