This is a most excellent reason.  Actually, I'd forgotten that Alaska has
quietly resumed the wolf hunts.  For those of you who don't know, it turns
out that the Alaska tourism folks are worried about the wolves keeping the
moose herds in such nice balance.  It seems that they can no longer say that
hunting is required to keep the herds in check.  So the solution is to shoot
wolves from airplanes.  They're hoping that the moose herd populations will
then explode, giving those nice hunters plenty to shoot at.

Bleah.  When will we learn?
