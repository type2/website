Subject: Re: collision risk

	Think of it as the Patton or Red Army theory of energy absorbtion:
&gt;You use the OTHER CAR'S crush zone!!!

Yeah this works, just let off the brakes prior to impact and get some 
additional height. Friend of mine put his '78 half way through the trunk of 
a burger-cruiser. The driver stopped in the freeway ramp because he couldn't 
see well enough to merge. My friend could see clearly and was hitting the 
gas at time of impact. 
        I just scanned Lemon Aid Used Vehicles 1995. Vanagon 1984-1991 DON'T 
BUY, how's that for a recommendation? Described as 'ugliest van' 
underpowered, etc. etc. and very dangerous due to winds and collisions. 
Fatal injuries blah blah. I live so fast and dangerous it scares me.   tim s.
