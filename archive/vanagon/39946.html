Hi

I phoned enquiries, Alpine Developments phone number is
+27 11 792 5300, phoned them to get the fax no
+27 11 792 3930. So there. :-)

Steve: so where was the pilot bearing? Sounds like in the flywheel.
Enquiring minds want to know. R.e. the vibration, I have a 1700 Type IV on a
Beetle 'box, also vibrates, mostly when shifting down between 3000 and 2000
rpm. The engine revs smoothly at high revs. (I had the whole thing balanced
when I built it.) Right now I think maybe it's the pilot bearing, 'cause
apparently the shaft is something like 17mm shorter on a Beetle. This would
probably also explain why the pilot is in the flywheel for a 914, different
gearbox. So I'm thinking I should have the flywheel welded and drilled to
take the pilot.

Basically my question is, at what revs did you get the vibration? There's a
clew in there somewhere :-)
