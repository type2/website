I want opinions on German v. Brazilian oil coolers.  This would be the
doghouse type that is going on a '71 bus, stock 1600DP.  I want a 
brand new one since the motor is new.  The price difference is about 
$50.  Is the Brazilian one ok or should I spring for one from the 
fatherland?  Thanks, Jim
