I woud'nt worry about it if the bus passes,  they Usually don't do too much
looking at VW's, and even when they do they are lucky to know which end your
engine is at.  As far as not being notified,  i used to live up north near
you and I NEVER got any of the notices until the pink one where it says
tghey are going to send you to alcatraz and confiscate your first born if
you don't comply with the emissions standards.  BTW, I have also heard that
the testors are more leaniant(sp?) in the city of Chicago vs. in the Burbs.
Hope this makes you feel better.
