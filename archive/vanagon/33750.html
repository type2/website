&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Do you have a carb or fuel injection?  If it is fuel injection, contrary to
&gt; &gt;popular opinion, pushing the gas pedal half way to the floor manual sets the
&gt; &gt;cold start throttle valve in the open position.  There is not actually any
&gt; &gt;fuel being pumped since the fuel pump is electric and the ignition would have
&gt; &gt;to be turned on.  (If you listen carefully, you can hear the pump activating
&gt; &gt;when you turn on the ignition).  So to answer your question, yes it does
&gt; &gt;help, and no, you are not flooding your engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you have a carberator, none of the above applies.  I'm no expert when it
&gt; &gt;comes to carbs systems.

I thought that in the VW FI system, the operation of the cold-start
valve is electrically controlled by the thermo-time switch.  The only
thing that pressing on the accelerator does is move a butterfly valve in
the intake air distributor to let more air into the engine, hence the
name Air Flow Controlled Fuel Injection.  The accelerator pedal has no
effect at all on the cold-start valve.  The thermo-time switch operates
that depending on the temperature of the air around the engine.  The
engine computer automatically computes the right mixture and all that
for cold starting, making pushing on the accelerator unnecessary.  So
say Bentley, Muir, and the VW owner's manuals.

Right?
