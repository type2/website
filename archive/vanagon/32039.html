Tom,

I almost bought one of these back in '92.   This is the standard 
configuration for a Carat.  It is very much like the Eurovan MV.  But 
personally I like the Carat over the MV, it just has more character.

I don't think these came with manual transmissions.  With how many times I 
replaced the clutch in my '86 GL, I would not recommend one to anyone who 
couldn't replace them themselves.

&gt;      On the road yesterday, I saw a very late Vanagon in Carat
&gt;      trim. The interior layout was unusual; club seating.
&gt;      Two rear facing seats backed up behind the driver and shotgun
&gt;      seats. The usual three person bench in back. If I'm not
&gt;      mistaken there was a table set up between the two rows of
&gt;      rear seats. Seems great for a family with kids, they can all
&gt;      color or whatever on the table in backlike our son does in
&gt;      the Westie, but it still seats seven.
&gt; 
&gt;      My neighbor likes the idea. Is this a standard configuration
&gt;      on the Carat? If not, what is the configuration called? What do we
&gt;      search the ads for?
&gt; 
&gt;      Can you get a carat with a stick ;-)?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      Thanks in advance:
