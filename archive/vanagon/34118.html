Subject: '72 camper SOLD!
Date: Tue, 30 Jan 1996 14:30:15 -0800 (PST)

Volks,
	The '72 Westy is sold.  I was contacted by the friend of a
listmember who agreed to purchase my bus complete (minus one or two
parts that I have already promised to people).  Sorry to all of those
that were interested in parts - I would love to have helped you all but
I am getting ready to move and being able to dispose of the bus locally
in one fell swoop is just what I needed.  Joel, I'm back to one bus!  :)

-David
