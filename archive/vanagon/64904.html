&gt; Very simple remedy to your situation.  I have fixed many customers starters
&gt; over the years with this same complaint.  Remove starter, (or have mechanic
&gt; do so) disassemble the solenoid, clean all of the parts to the solenoid, and
&gt; lubricate with synthetic motor oil (Mobil 1 or Castrol Syntec).  This will
&gt; fix you right up and won't cost you much, either.
&gt; Let me know how it works out for you.

Rick,

I spoke with my mechanic about the advice you gave about cleaning and
lubing the solenoid, only to have him tell me that getting to the
starter on a Syncro is hell. Guess I'll live with it for awhile rather
than have him drop the engine or tranny just to get to the starter and
solenoid.  Is it really that hard, due to the tight quarters imposed by
the fuel tank?

Here's a dumb question for you or any one else who wants to jump in.
Does it compromise the window integrity if the corroded shitty looking
faux chrome trim is removed from the windshield and other window seals?
I ripped it out of an old '83 I had with no problems, but again, I was
more of a moron back then.

Thanks for your post.
