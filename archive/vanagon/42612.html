Subject: VIN question

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted as well.


I have a question concerning the VIN from my '67 Westy.  After
removing decades of crud (thank you supermarket steam cleaners....and
yes the engine was out), the number stamped to the right of the engine
is *247016777*.  You see the problem?  I tried to look this up in the
Muir book and in the faq [faq copy I have starts in '68], but it is
not there...as a matter of fact it appears to be off the scale.  I
even [just now] went back out to the bus to ensure that I did not make
an error in transcribing the number.  Is it possible that the '4' is
suppose to be a '1' and that my bus was actually built between
July-December '66 [probably still a '67 model year] an not in '67.
I've always kinda wondered if it was a '66 based on the wiring
harness...it matches the '66 schematic in my Bentley manual much
closer than the '67 one [mods made by the PO withstanding].

Additionally, my engine number is H123628 which places the engine in
the same time frame (as near as I can tell)....though I was told by
the PO that the engine was from a '73 beetle :-S 

Am I even close with these assumptions?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks....Oh, my!
