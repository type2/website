&gt; Now, its time to start doing my homework. Can anyone tell me of a
&gt; publication that describes and gives specifications of the various
&gt; Vanagon models since, say, 1985?

Yes.

When I was getting a Peter Russek Manual for the watercooled Transporter
from VW Books, I asked the bookshop if they had anything else interesting
and they mentioned 'Volkswagen Bus-Camper-Van 1979-1989' by Brooklands Road
Test Books. The front cover has an orange and cream Caravelle and text
says: Road &amp; Comparison Tests. Microbus. 4x4. Holdsworth. Transporter.
Kombi. Devon. Wasserboxer. Caravelle. Vanagon. Syncro. Kamper. Autosleeper.
Oettinger. Turbobus.

It is a chronological set of articles about the Transporter from numerous
publications around the world, compiled by R.M. Clarke. There are 100
A4-sized pages from 29 articles dating from 1979 to 1989. Two or three 
by Road and Track I have seen in the archives. Other publications include
Car, Autocar, Car &amp; Driver and VW Motoring. One title I liked was 'The King
is Back!' from Modern Motor May 1982.

The articles cover the vehicles from many points of view and various
angles, such as from the commercial vehicle angle ('Commercial and
Luxurious Eight-Seater' from Commercial Motor Oct 1982, the history and
evolution of the Bus angle ('Transporter Tradition Triumphs' from R &amp; T Sep
89), the minibus angle, people carrier angle, the camping angle, the
supercharging angle ('Oettinger Caravelle 3.2' from Car 1988).

It was handy to find all the articles in one place and I would recommend
this book to all Transporter enthusiasts and upgraders.

Distributed by Brooklands Book Distribution Ltd, 'Holmerise', Seven Hills
Road, Cobham, Surrey, England. ISBN 1 870642 783. I got mine from VW Books
in Leicester, UK, Tel: 0044 116 286 6686. It cost me 8.95 UK pounds +
postage.
