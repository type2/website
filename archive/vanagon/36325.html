Subject: Start/no start

Well tonight I didn't heed the warnings and now the 81 sits over at the
church parking lot  acting as if it doesn't even have a starter after having
happily motored over an hour earlier for a basketball game. Power everywhere
but the starter. Happened a couple of times prior but started after 5 or 6
tries so I guess I got cocky.

Am I using selective memory when I seem to recall that the fix for this was
nothing more  than cleaning the connections at the starter? Does that sound
right and are there more involved possibilities?

Thanks,

Weston
