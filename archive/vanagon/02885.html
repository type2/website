&gt; 	Sorry if this has already been covered, but it there any way
&gt; to get a digest of the mail, like on vintagvw.  I can't sort through
&gt; all the traffic to get important messages (ie. getting a job upon 
&gt; graduation) but I still enjoy reading the van mail.  

I just thought I would add another choice. Procmail.  It's a nice little 
program that put all the Vanagon stuff in it's own folder, and all the 
VintageVW stuff in it's own.  That leaves my mail box free for other 
stuff.
