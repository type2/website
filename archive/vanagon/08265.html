A general rule of thumb is if you are going over 50 mph and more than 50
miles than the transmission end of things should be raised off the
ground; otherwise putting the trans in neutral should work. OTOH, I have
seen many small fwd cars being towed behind without being raised off the
ground. perhaps disconnecting the rear shafts would be the way to go. --
