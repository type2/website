&gt; My trepidation was unwarranted, it turned out - 

Congrats...

&gt; Here's what the computer told the technician to look for in the Visual
&gt; Inspection:
&gt;
&gt; PCV System
&gt; Thermostatic Air Cleaner
&gt; Fuel Evaporative Controls
&gt; Exhaust Gas Recirculation
&gt; Ignition Spark Controls
&gt; Carburetor
&gt; Air Injection Pump
&gt; Air Pump Belt
&gt; Air Injection Plumbing
&gt; Air Diverter Valve
&gt; Vacuum Line Connections to Sensors/Switches

I'm not clear on what some of these things are--can anyone elaborate?
For example, air injection pump and pump belt?  Thermostatic air
cleaner?  Air diverter valve?  Are all these things specific to
California, or are they installed on other buses as well, but go by
different names in common VW parlance?  Does PCV stand for &quot;positive
crankcase ventilation&quot;?

Also, do the guys doing the CA inspections actually know what they're
looking for?  Do they ever ask where something is?  What if they
couldn't identify the X-and-such (even if it's there)--would they
certify your car?

Many questions,
Rodney
