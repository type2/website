I've heard them called &quot;weeder geese&quot; and have heard good reports. They 
seem hearty and stout, though I would think it cruel to ask them to 
protect your property from coyotes.

I've also seen wild Canadian geese serve as burgular alarms. This at a 
boat dock where they traditionally winter...and are supplied with free food.

&gt; Staying near home and showing an eager willingness to shoot strangers seems
&gt; to be the best solution, at least in my case.  Indeed, in light of recent
&gt; court decisions regarding the responsibilities of public safety
&gt; organizations, a vigorous self-defense of your home and person may be the
&gt; only solution.

In the rural community where I grew up, your best protection (at least 
from local scum) was a reputation as a crazy SOB who didn't mind taking 
care of business. A neighboring farmer was rumored to have killed and 
buried a burglar. I believe he started that rumor. It was very effective.
