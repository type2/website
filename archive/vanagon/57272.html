Subject: WTB: Vanagon Rear hatch w/wiper

Hi Volks.
    This past weekend we had a nice crappy storm with snow, sleet,
freezing rain the works.  Anyway, I'm tired of driving around without a
rear wiper on the camper. It makes it very difficult to see bout back. 
If anyone has one in decent shape they would like to sell, please let me
know.  While I'm asking how about a dashpot w/tach?  Any leads?  Thanks.
Take care
