  After a lovely meeting of the TAB (triangle area buses), which I will
let Gary write about, it has been decided to do another camp-out get
together shindig at Raleigh's Umstead State Park. It would be the night
of Saturday, July 22, with wholesome fun all day Saturday, and then
departing Sunday noonish. Camping in the family camping section is $9.00
per site, which is 2 vehicles, and/or 6 people. There were 2 splits, a
late model, and a vanagon at the last one, and now that our attendance
is continually increasing, I would love to see lots of people there! 
 If anyone needs directions or anything, let me know...
Richard
