 Because the firing order is 1-4-3-2, with the engine turning clockwise.
 If you start at 1, and turn the crank counter-clockwise, you get
 1-2-3-4.  I think its real easy to remember.

Right, the firing order is 1-4-3-2 but if you rotate counter-clockwise and
start with #1, adjust the valves for #1 cylinder, rotate engine 180 degrees
to #2 and adjust the valves for #2 cylinder, you have done both valve on the
same side of the engine (passenger side) and can close it up.  Keep rotating
180 degrees and do #3 and rotate again 180  for #4  (these are on the
driver's side). Now close up the valve cover. Its easier to complete one side
at a time rather than going from side to side as in the clockwise 1-4-3-2
order.
