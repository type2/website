Subject: extra Westfalia seats

Joel's recent repost of a forsale notice for an '86 Westfalia
included mention of a &quot;slide-in captain's chair for seating 5&quot;.
I have heard of these, and I sure would like to have something to
seat an extra person or two (the Westy is just a 4-seater!).  Was
this a dealer option?  Are there any aftermarket outfits that
make a seat for this?  I have been told by a couple of local 
van customizers that they could improvise something, but I'd
rather get a proven product.
