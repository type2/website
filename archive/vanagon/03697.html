Thanks to Joel, David, Tim, Leo, Eric, and Derek (did I forget anyone?)
for your help. I finally got the old exhaust off, basically using all the
suggestions except for the nut breaker and the propane torch (the idea
made me a bit nervous, although at one desperate moment I was willing to
burn the whole damn thing). Each $%^&amp; pair of bolt and nut required its
own, special, individual treatment: liquid wrench (sorry, didn't get
Mopar, Dodge dealer is too far), cold chisel, hacksaw, etc. 

And now to something completely different: I got a good look at the right
heat exchanger and it's perforated with rust. No wonder I got cold in the
winter. Is there a way to save it, i.e. wrap new sheet metal around the
aluminum block? (If not, I guess I'll have to special order them from San
Diego, David?)
