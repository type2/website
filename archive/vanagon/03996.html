&gt;
&gt;Why would you refuse to travel in the USA?

Leo,
I have nothing against America.  As a matter of fact I 
spent ten days in San Jose a couple of months ago.  
However, since I live in the third largest country in
the world (USA is fourth) that has a very small 
population ratio compared to size.  Canada has an
excellent infrastructure, amazing scenery, polite
reasonably well educated population, and sadly; the
much under utilized Trans Canada Highway.  
It makes no sense to travel in the US when my money
doesn't go far, there are too many people, and no
under explored scenic areas.  It may seem to be a 
cheap nationalistic sentiment, but if I'm going to travel
over 6000 miles in the bus;  I'd rather do it here.  --Ralf
