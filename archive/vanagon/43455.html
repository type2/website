Subject: Re: IRS Conversions?

&gt; I asked this question about 2 months ago or so and I don't recall ever 
&gt;getting a response.  I am new to busses.  I have a 66 that I bought which 
&gt;I still need to go pick up and bring home.  I remember though, that by 
&gt;looking underneath, it had the reduction boxes on it.  Now I hear about 
&gt;these IRS conversions that in effect, remove the boxes, but doesn't that 
&gt;take away the mechanical advantage?  I would tend to think that it would 
&gt;make the engine work harder to move the bus along.  Thanks for any input 
&gt;in this regard...

I don't think you really need to worry about losing the mechanical
advantage, unless you are running a 25hp or 36 hp motor.  People tell me
they get much better driveability out of their busses when converted to IRS
- lower engine speeds for one...
