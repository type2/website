&gt; Subject:       Tracing Vacuum Leaks/brakes
&gt; 
&gt; Since I was the one who got on the soap-box, I'll offer some
&gt; suggestions I've found useful in tracing various vacuum leaks.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Stick a hose in your ear.  Really.  By placing a section of
&gt; heater hose or nearly anything, including a tube from a roll of paper
&gt; towels, against your ear it makes your hearing in that one ear very directional..
&gt; With the unhosed ear plugged (picture me with one hand over one ear,
&gt; a section of heater hose sticking out the other :) sweep across the
&gt; suspect areas until the hiss is loudest then start homing in.  Do
&gt; this in the parking lot of K-Mart and watch the looks you get.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Put a few psi air pressure into the vacuum hose system.  I've
&gt; discussed this one before but essentially hook up a regulated air
&gt; hose dialed down to a few psi, into your vacuum system and listen for
&gt; leaks and use that squirt bottle of soap water to spray hoses, parts,
&gt; etc.  Use caution with this method if you have a vehicle with vacuum
&gt; servo doors in the heating/cooling system as it may inflate the
&gt; bellows designed for a negative pressure, not a positive one.  The
&gt; brake booster often has a check valve in-line so this may not reveal
&gt; a leak in that device.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Systematically, remove the vacuum hose connection from devices
&gt; and plug the end of the hose to remove that device from the vacuum
&gt; circuit. Golf tees work nice for plugging vacuum lines.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  Use a vacuum gauge.  This ends up being your 'test meter' and
&gt; have a nice assortment of &quot;T&quot; fittings, hose pieces, and other
&gt; adapters.  This is one of those 'tools' you accumulate thru the years
&gt; and it keeps getting better as you fill out your fittings box.
&gt; 
&gt; 5.  I don't like the flammable liquids/gases method.  Some people
&gt; spray carb cleaner, use propane, or even starting fluid (ether) to
&gt; spray around while the engine is running to notice an RPM difference.
&gt;  You're on your own with this one.  I've seen too many bad
&gt; experiences with ether, benzene and other organic solvents in the
&gt; chem lab to go spraying them around a hot engine.  (Got a great story
&gt; re: benzene, sink traps, a row of 5 chem sinks, and an open flame...)
