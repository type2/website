&gt;Anybody ever replaced one of these?  Anything out of the ordinary?
&gt;
&gt;

     Yuck.  Not my favorite repair (not that I can think of a favorite.  
Be sure to try to keep brake fluit off of... well everything.  
Unfourtinately when you spill it, you'll spill it on wires, and carpet, 
and painted surfafaces and so on.  I packed a plastic bag under the area 
before I removed and replaced.  It helped a lot.
     Be sure to bleed the bad one dry before you remove to cut down on 
spilage, and even more fun, bench bleed the new one before you put it in, 
it will save you a lot of work.

     Have fun, and be gentle with the insturment cluster!
