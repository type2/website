&gt; &gt;-After driving about 15 minutes at moderate speed, I ran up the
&gt; &gt;highway at about 3500rpm in 3rd, before braking for a hard right turn
&gt; &gt;to the dealer, and up a short hill (in 1st), after which the oil
&gt; &gt;pressure light/buzzer came on- it stayed on for 5-10 secs before I
&gt; &gt;killed the engine &amp; coasted. Temp was middle gauge, fan not on. I
&gt; &gt;started it again &amp; seemed fine, oil level ok.
&gt; 
&gt; could be a lousy Fram filter ... if the dealer is doing anything to the bus,
&gt; it's likely that he did NOT use a vw filter. and Fram (and possibly some
&gt; other &quot;cheap&quot; filter brands) are known to cause pressure problems in vw's
&gt; and porche's. might also be the brand/weight of oil ... if the oil is too
&gt; thin, like a 10W50, it could cause pressure problems, too.
&gt; 
You got it! I called the dealer to check &amp; they said it has an orange 
filter... 
Sure glad I switched to VW filters on my Jetta...

They also said the poor running could be bad gas, as it has sat for a 
few months with about 1/4 tank in it... which could make sense I 
guess.

I'm going to have another drive soon, so I'll know more then.

ps: They've also dropped their price to 12,500 final offer...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
