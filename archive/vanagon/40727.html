Subject: change the stats

well, it is finally gone.  the gentlman who bought my 75 westy finally
showed up and took it home.  one more parking spot out front now.  it took
some time to get it gone because i had trouble finding a problem in the
starting system.  anyway, it is gone now.  joel, take one 75 bus off the
official list.

Take care and God Bless
matt
