Subject: Web server update...


It's been a long while since I've had any time at all to work on the VW Van
Web server, much less monitor the mailing list.  I still don't really, but
we just upgraded to a Pentium processor and I juggled some files on our
server, which affected the van stuff, so I touched up a few things (nothing
major, mostly changes to make it easier to maintain).  In the next few weeks
our Internet link will jump from 56k to 384k as well, so images should
download much faster.

Just a reminder... The server is available at

	http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/

As a practical matter, I will delete old mail archives for the list in the
near future.  There are currently 68MB of saved messages.  If someone wants
them (in HTML format with indexes, one message per file), let me know and I
will arrange for you to pick them up by anonymous ftp.

As I get time I will try and handle the outstanding requests for various
updates to the server.  If you have any input or questions, please feel free
to drop me a note.
