&gt;I dont know anything about the westy seals but I recently bought a full set of
&gt;Lloyds mats for my 86 GL.  They are expensive on the order of $200. for front
&gt;and rear but really great. They match my lt.brown carpet perfectly and are a
&gt;heavy, soil resistant, rubber backed carpet.  I actually had to get my local VW
&gt;dealer parts department to become a Lloyds' dealer for me but it was no cost to
&gt;them to do so.  So either call your local VW dealer and have them call Lloyds (I
&gt;don't have Lloyds' number) or call Metro VW Parts in DFW,TX at (214)256-1102.
&gt;They'd be glad to help.

&gt;I just purchased some Lloyd mats for my '91 from Kyle Wade.
&gt;They are very nice. Color matched perfectly to interior. His e-mail is:
