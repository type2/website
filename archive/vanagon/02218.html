&gt;One more point ...its the outliers that we are really interested in
&gt;though and in that case clearly CHEVRON 87 in your data offers by far the
&gt;least bang for the buck...almost the most expensive and the crummiest

and why would EXXON 92 stick out like that? obviously, not enough test
data for the higher octanes. :)
