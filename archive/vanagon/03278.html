Subject: RE: vw uniqueness

&gt;Seems the farther out in the boonies I am, the
&gt;more people wave.

Around here (Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Bellingham, WA), there are way way
too many Vangons, Busses, &amp; Eurovans on the road to begin waving at all of
'em. To cope, we have limited our waving to only exact like kinds - Syncro
Campers.

As we increase our distance from home and bricks of all sorts become rarer
(especially when heading in a south easterly direction), our waving
criteria are relaxed.

On a side note, it makes me wonder what we'd be driving if VW could sell in
the rest of the country with the impunity they do here around Puget Sound.
No doubt it'd be cool, and horrendously expensive.
