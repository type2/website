&gt; i think you are mistaking the Mercedes factory-mounted foglights for

&gt; all.
&gt; 
&gt; but the headlights are, i'm pretty sure, NOT yellow in any country.
&gt; 
&gt; so what you could do is get some large, 7&quot; yellow foglights (Hella and
&gt; Cibie make them) and put them on the front. :)

Yes, Hellas are cool, too.
 
&gt; why yellow foglights? eh? some folks think yellow helps you see better
&gt; in fog. i've got white/clear foglights and have found that if you position
&gt; them correctly (low enough), they work fine. i didn't like the strange
&gt; color of everything with the yellow ones.
&gt; 
&gt; just my opinions. :)

Some people think that yellow reduces glare. I believe this is also why
shooters wear yellow glasses. I might be able to use my high beams more
often (I am night blind, isn't everybody?) if they presented less glare
to oncoming traffic.

Of course if it didn't make an improvement, I would always be left with
COOL LOOKING YELLOW HEADLIGHT LENSES ;) How could I loose?
