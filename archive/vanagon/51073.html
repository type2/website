Subject: First Westy questions....
Date: Tue, 29 Oct 96 20:17:45 EST

Hello all,
Well, I've just gotten my new '81 Westy home and I've already got some
questions.  

1st:  The faucet pump appears to not be working.  It looks to me like
the pump is in the faucet housing itself.  Is there an easy way to test
this, or will I have to remove it?  If I have to remove it, how do I go
about doing so?  

2nd:  The annunciator panel is being goofy.  It's telling me that the
battery is in the red zone when in fact the battery is A-OK.  What might
cause this?  I have no idea how this thing works.

3rd:  The propane on/off knob on the outside of the van leaks propane
when turned on.  I guess that it's a seal of some sort that needs
replacing.  I suppose I can get a rebuild kit at an RV place?  

4th:  Two of the three camper panels on the outside of the van have lost
the spring tension they're supposed to have.  They're not flapping in
the breeze yet, but does anyone sell the spring-loaded replacements?  I
seem to remember someone saying these things wear out from time to time.

That should be all for now.

Thanks for all help,
Sean
