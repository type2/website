Subject: Re: FW: lowest mileage

I agree with Ed's 'dream'! While in the process of buying my '91 Westy, I am
still QUITE in the market for a low miles SYNCRO. Have found leads on 2 but 
have been unable to be first to the gate on either. If anyone knows of a low
miles Syncro in excellent condition in need of love and a new stable, 
PLEASE LET ME KNOW!

&gt; 
&gt; All this debate- It's funny.  . . . .  I think the key on
&gt; the Vanagon side is to own a driver, and then a Syncro in the stable
&gt; with almost no miles just in case...
&gt; 
&gt; One can only dream...
