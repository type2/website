Thanks to all out there that responded to my quest.  I finally got that '73
in my '72.  Now all I have to do is put on the carbs, find out why that bar
from the left carb to the right no longer goes ALL the way from the left carb
to the right, replace the accelerator cable, the on in there now went to the
1600cc, hook up the heat exchangers, the muffler, plug up the holes for the
EGR system that the '73 had that the '72 doesn't need, hook up distributor
and fuel lines, buy a new battery, and fire it up!  Actually there is one
more thing I need to do, the gas in this tank has been in there since October
1992 and of course its almost full, so I need to do something with it.  Any
suggestions?

Then I'll get to do other stuff like brakes, sheet metal, paint, shift
linkage, etc, etc, etc, ......

Again...Thanks to all!!
