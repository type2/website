&gt;&gt; '82 VW Pop-top Camper For Sale. Only 86,000 miles total and less than 10,000
&gt;&gt; on the rebuilt engine.  The body is rust-free and in remarkable condition,
&gt;Doesn't it seem strange that it needed a new engine after only 76K miles?

not if you've seen the way some people drive air-cooled buses! lugging them
around in 3rd gear at 20 mph ... imho, that'll burn an engine up in very
short order. lots of people bought the campers and didn't bother to read the
owners manual, or learn how to take care of the engine. imhbobo (in my humble
but obviously biased opinion). :)
