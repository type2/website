     No I do not believe it is safe.  I have read that gasoline fumes are a 
     carcinogen.  Understand that what constitutes prolonged exposure may 
     not be the levels expereinced while traveling in your van. 
     
     Why would you want to smell it?  A great number of people experience 
     far more immediate side effects of gasoline vapor inhalation such as 
     nausea.
     
     Why not just strap it to your roof?  That's what I do.  I've never had 
     anyone steal my container, and it just looks cool up there.
     
     But if you are hell bent on keeping it inside your van, search out 
     some type of vapor containment device.  Several outdoor companies make 
     dry bags for rafting/kayaking that you could certainly put a small 1 
     gallon gas can in.  It would certainly save you the stench.  Maybe 
     even a giant zip-lock back.
     
     Hope this helps.......

I was wondering if it is safe to carry an extra gallon of gas in a gas 
canaster inside my 1980 camper.  I'm sure some people do it.  Could you 
put the canaster in one of the cabinets?  (since my gas meter is broke, I 
have to judge the level on milage)
     
Any advice would be great.
