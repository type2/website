&gt;By models I mean the little 1:25ish scale models in plastic that
&gt;one glues together.

Unfortunately, the details are lost to time, but I have such a model of a
'62 - '67 panel van.  It was one of the major model manufacturers from the
mid-70s (Revell, AMC, ?). It was sold as a surfin' van, with a roof rack
and dual, tall CB antennas (and nerf-bumpers). There are probably some
still out there, but finding them could prove a chore...

Mine is painted just like The Bozobus (same paint!).
