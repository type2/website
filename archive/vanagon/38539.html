Subject: Busses on 66?  (long)

Still thinking about doing the Bus camping gathering in conjunction with 
our club's car show on the weekend of June 15th.  Unfortunately the only 
camping place around with showers is the local KOA (but it is a *very* 
nice KOA, national award winner, etc.).  The rate for the large open area 
would be $150 for Fri-Sun (noon) and each camper would be $13.50 - $15.00 
per night (approx. $20 per night for the event).  How many of you (and other 
Bus folk you know) would be interested in such a gathering.  GROOVE's 
June Bug Jamboree is on Sat. and I'm thinking of doing a small (75 mile) 
cruise of our piece of Route 66 on Sunday.  We are located in Springfield, MO.

I need as much feedback as I can get by Monday.  Thanks!  :-)

I still need worms-eye-view photos of various Busses for the T-shirts ...
