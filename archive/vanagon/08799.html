I would like to disagree with Derek Drew's observation that every
piece of &quot;chatter&quot; here on vanagon is copyrightable. Putting on
my attorney's hat for a second, there are three possibilities regarding
ownership of the so-called intellectual property being zapped along
the information superhighway...

If we consider the intent of the parties as using this media as 
a form of communication as one would use a phone, or even a
telegraph message, then there is no copyright protection.

Second even if one were to stretch the point that what is being
transmitted here is copyrightable...in otherwords, a form of
expression in which an idea has been put into tangible form (
tangible according to the 1980 copyright act being either directly
perceived by human senses or with the aid of an intermediary
device), then the lack of copyright notice precludes the
creator of the &quot;expression&quot; from exercising any rights
under the copyright law except going to a court of law and asking
for injunctive relief in the form of a restraining order demanding
the &quot;innocent infringer&quot; stop the further publication of the
copyrighted material.

The third option is that everybody on this list (or anyother list
for that matter) put a copyright notice on those contributions
which would appear to be &quot;valuable&quot;. The copyright notice
would then allow the owner of the I.P. to recover the value of
the use of the I.P. (oops Intellectual Property) as well as
to obtain a restraining order against those who are wrongfully
using it.

I think (and I'd be glad to do the research for a cut of the
proceeds of the book... &lt;I told you I had my lawyer's hat
on right noe...&gt;) is that the contents of a user's group
is analagous to public domain software...everybody contributes
to the creation ... but no one has ownership rights.

For those of you who think your contributions here have any
&quot;value&quot; then put a copyright notice on it...


...putting on my VW cap now...
