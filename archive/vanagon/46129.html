Subject: couple brake job questions

I'd like to replace the wheel cylinders on my '87, and I think I can 
handle the mechanical aspects.  However, the manuals say to disconnect 
the brake line.  How do you disconnect the brake line and keep the fluid 
from spilling all over the place??  Is there a valve that you can close 
temporarily while changing the cylinder??

I know this is a basic question, but any help would be appreciated.  
Also, what kind of hose do I need to connect to the bleeder valve to 
bleed the brakes?

Thanks for the assistance.
