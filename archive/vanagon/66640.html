Slight pressure from a screw driver should allow you to remove the
screws in the marker lights..&quot;SLIGHT Pressure&quot;

&gt;
&gt; I have tried to find the appropriate directions to do this in Bentley but have
&gt; been unsuccessful.  How does one go about removing the side panel trims (the
&gt; PO had attached a couple of brackets to the trim panel using stove bolts and
&gt; nuts which I want to remove)?  Bentley seems to hint that the rear headliner
&gt; should be removed first, but I don't know if this is necessary.
&gt;
&gt; On a related issue, will this give me access to the rear light markers from
&gt; the inside.  I have a problem in that the passenger side the plastic tabs into
&gt; which the marker is screwed into, are spinning in place.  I haven't
&gt; successfully been able to get the marker off to replace the burnt out bulb.
&gt; (And yes I have done this on the driver's side so that I know that you have to
&gt; pull at the marker to maintain pressure on the plastic tab as you are
&gt; unscrewing ;-)).
&gt;
&gt; I'd be most grateful if someone who is familiar with the procedure could walk
&gt; me through the steps.
&gt;
&gt; advTHANKSance.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
