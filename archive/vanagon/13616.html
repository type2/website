Subject: 71' engine update part 2 -- please help!

In the last post I had 179 miles on my new engine, now I have almost 1000!  
I drove to northern virginia over spring break, which accounts for 600 
miles.  I found out why my valves are getting looser:  The adjustment screws 
are wearing out in a very short time.  It took only 500 miles to get the 
screws to be so hammered that the ends were no longer convex.  I can't 
figure out why this is, I had adjusted them to .006&quot; every 100~200 miles.  I 
replaced all the screws in no. va. and adjusted the valves, and now after 
only 400 miles the same thing is happening.  This is crazy! How do I fix 
this problem?  I had also replaced the screws at rebuild time, and the guy 
in nova hasn't had this happen to him, how about those on the list?  
TIA-
