Subject: Re: Towing a Syncro on all 4's/ Ed's 2 phennings worth

Dennis, thanks for the insight re: the trailer brake issue, While I totally
agree with the legal and practical aspect of towing a vanagon on all 4's, I
have sucessfully towed my van behind a 35' Monaco motorhome w/4 wheel discs
w/o ever knowing it was behind as the additional 4k lbs was insignificant in
relation to the overall mass of the RV 22k lbs.Then again, Ive towed my 8k lb
boat w/4 wheel brakes on the trailer and definately appreciate the added
stopping power.
