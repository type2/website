Subject: Steve Johnson's New Bus

      Well, I just got home after spending most of the day getting Steve's
new single cab up and running and home.
I'm too tired to relate the whole story right now, I'll do that in a
separate post.  Quite an interesting day, though!

        BTW - Today is Steve Johnson's BIRTHDAY!  Wanna know how old he is?
He's was born in the same year
my barndoor was...
