Subject: Re: Westy Tire Pressures?

Do not overinflate the tires. They sold you the wrong tire, but they will
work fine. You got a tire rated for passenger car service. The Vanagon
wants a tire rated for truck service. I think the load ranges are B for
passenger car and C for truck. If they insist they sold you the correct
tire ask them to put in writing they will accept all responsibility for any
liabilities and damages that could result from the tires being
overinflated. That usually gets them back paddling. If you don't want to do
that you can use those tires. I've been running passenger tires on my
Vanagon for about two years and I haven't seen any back effects. I run them
at the tire's maximum pressure or sticker. Which ever is lowest. HTH

&gt;I just bought a set of reinforced Michelin X tires for my 86 Westfalia. The
&gt;max tire pressure is 40 psi, yet the sticker on the door calls for 48 psi in
&gt;the rear tires. The dealer (Wheelworks, a large chain in the SF Bay Area)
&gt;insists that they are the correct tires. What's going on here?
