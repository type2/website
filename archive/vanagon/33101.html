Subject: Scope a bus in L.A.--please?

Sorry to repeat myself, but I didn't get any replies after the
Left-coast crowd got home from work yesterday, so I wanted to repeat
my plea--Could someone in Los Angeles check out a bus for me?  Yes, it
fits my criteria--brown interior and sunroof!  1979, supposedly with
70K original miles.

Let me know soon, seller has other interested people...
Many many thanks.

Stuck in NJ,
Rodney
