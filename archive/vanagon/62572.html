&gt;&gt; To All those who asked for more info on the small a/c unit, Toyotomi
TID-1200
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I purchased mine at: Yaohan Best (a Japanese grocery store in San Diego)
&gt;&gt; The price in 1993 was $550 &amp; tax. I called them and they only carry the
&gt;&gt; larger TID-1800.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; But I digress, The TID-1200 is a 4000 BTU, 400W (very efficient), small (W
&gt;&gt; 10.5in. X D 14in X H 26in), weight 43lbs, Quiet, freestanding a/c unit.
&gt;&gt; This unit uses an exhaust hose which I stick out whichever window is
&gt;&gt; convenient at the time, depending on if I'm parked or driving.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I called the place that distributes them in L.A., Shilac Ent., Phone#
&gt;&gt; 310-791-2855. They said no one carries the 1200 anymore but you can order
&gt;&gt; one direct from them by calling. She said the price is now $639. I assume
&gt;&gt; that would be plus shipping.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If anyone's interested, my girlfriend purchased the larger TID-1800 at the
&gt;&gt; same time. It's 7200btu, uses 840W but it's a bit much for what I had in
&gt;&gt; mind. Both have never given a lick of trouble.

&gt;&gt; hey bob 
&gt;one more question about your airconditioner..you mention weather you are 
&gt;parked or driving&quot;  does this mean it runs off 12v dc?
&gt;thanks for info so far
&gt;Dave 97 evc
&gt;
Dave,
No, it doesn't run on 12 volts unless you have an inverter. An inverter of
that size (500 watts plus) isn't very practical for a VW alternator, i
don't believe. Let's see 400 watts div by 13.5 volts = 29.62962962963 amps,
continuos. I've done it for short times with a 1000 watt inverter, while
running, but I don't think it's wise for the long haul. As I said before, I
run it off a Honda EX650 generator. In my motor home, I do run it off the
inverter at &quot; siesta time &quot;, but I have 400 amps of battery and solar power
and a wind generator.Good luck with it,
