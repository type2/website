There's a lot of us on the 'net', as I've seen.

While I'm in Washington,DC now, I spent (and spent, and spent, $$$) a lot 
of time at U-W, Madison (ONe of my favoriate places in the entire world is 
having dinner in the Edgewater overlooking the lake).

I'k planning to Go to U-W, Eau Claire or U-W, Stout next summer for some 
refresher and 'fill-in' courses.

Who else out here claims (or will admit to) U-W heritage?
