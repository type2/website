Subject: Re: 1972 Bus for cheap - Ethics??

As people on the list may be aware, or not, I am moving to San Francisco in
June/July.  I am bringing my 73 Westy with me from Canada and I have been
warned that it may not be cheap or easy to get it liscenced in CA.  Now, if
one possessed less than lily white standards, what is to stop one from
swapping the VINS from a  CA beater bus like the one below to one's 73?

Also, in my last two weeks in S.F. I saw scores of old buses with clapped
out motors and obviously defunct pollution controls, or exhaust systems.
How do these buses pass the smog checks?

&gt;1972 VW Bus, white with tan interior.
&gt;Body has some small dents, and a small rust hole at the battery tray,
&gt;otherwise it is straight.  Interior panels and headliner are original
&gt;and intact.
&gt;Its TypeIV motor is disasembled and stored in the cargo bay.  It needs
&gt;smog and a rebuild.  Currently, it has a 2bbl carb and header exhaust.
&gt;$200 or best offer in Costa Mesa, CA.
&gt;

&gt;This one's headed for the crusher, folks.  The owner said that it will
&gt;be sold this month one way or the other.  I'd like to see it stay on the
&gt;road, but I can't afford to put new smog motor in it.  I'm still paying
&gt;off the bill from the new motor in my own breadloaf.  Sigh.
