You guys are getting better and better each trip.  The only thing I
have left over (at least so far as I've unpacked) is that cute little
tea kettle we were teasing about being a landmine.  Anyone?  I'll save
it for you.  All else I've found the owners for.

Thanks to everyone for showing up, and for making this the best attended
event ever.  What a showing!  The collective culinary talents rise to
a new height each time.  Next time, we're thinking Asian for cuisine,
stay tuned and/or make your nomination in the interim.

Thanks to Kathy and Mark for doing a tremendous amount of leg and mental
work to put this together for us.  The spot was lovely (still coughing
from the dust, but this will be better after the car's washed  :).  It
is a fabulous part of the country, and one I've always wanted to see.
The homebrew was wonderful, too.

If we get any more people next time, we're going to have to have TWO
campfires - just so we can all get close enuff to stay warm.  

Kathy is working for us to find some sort of winter chalet-type cabin
for an indoor winter outing in the snow.  This will of course provide
endless opportunities for winter sports very common in the Mammoth
area, such as skiing, sledding, whatever.  I can't wait, although
keep in mind, that the route in during winter from at least the
bay area will take longer, since Yosemite's Tioga isn't open during
that season.  Further, according to a native of the Mammoth area,
the very spot we camped on will soon be buried in 20-30 feet of
snow.  We'll keep you posted on all of this.

Thanks again one an all for such a successful trip.

 Current lust list: DC/12v coffee-grinder &amp; blender, a Eurovan TDI transporter,
  black currant juice, a moped, hot showers and a faucet top for my '81 westy,
   and last but not least:  a pair of those old-fashioned metal roller-skates,
    made, I think, by Winchester (but any would do) - the kind which fasten
     onto the outside of your shoes and are length- and width-adjustable
      with a metal key.  They have leather straps for the ankle.  They were
       very popular in the 60's.
