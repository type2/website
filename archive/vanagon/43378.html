My 80 Wanagon has silver wheels and my 84 Westy has black wheels.  So I
looked them up in the trusty fiche machine and here's what I found (80-85
Vanagon fiche dated 1993):

80-84 Vanagon  Color Code L 009 100  Chrome Colored
**Guess that's VW's term for Mexican Chrome :-)
***Special Note:  71-79 Breadloaves used the same rim type and that fiche &amp;
the old parts book says L91 chrome color as well - may have been superseded
to the newer Vanagon type paint code***

85 Vanagon  Color Code LAD 003 C00  Rally Black

Why I have Black Wheels on an 84 is a mystery, but they certainly look better
with the full sized spoked silver wheel covers attached to 'em.  Original PO
coulda painted them but it looks factory to me.  Nothing is mentioned in the
M or S Codes on the fiche indicating a special option for these as well.  I
run standard chrome hubcaps on the 80.

Hope this helps :-)
