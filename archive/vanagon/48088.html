Subject: Re: EV Parts Hauler...  And animal hauler


Now that we're at trading stories, I should mention the 10HP SEARS
lawn tractor I hauled in the '87...  Jump Seats off, it slides in
like a transverse mounted engine, i.e., sideways.  I could have taken
both the middle and the rear seat off and carried it in the EV, but the
87 turned out to be easier.

BTW, yes, the Vanagon  has about 1.5 inches longer
&quot;middle room&quot; than the EV, but they are both very spacious
in the mid-side of the vehicle.
