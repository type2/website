&gt;      The question is: Once the bolts are removed holding the inner cvj to the 
&gt;      final drive/differential, will the complete assembly(inner cvj, axle, and 
&gt;      outer cvj) pull out, as if on a spline? or are there similar bolts(to those 
&gt;      holding the inner cvj) on the outer cvj that need to be removed?  If so, 
&gt;      how does one access them?

There are 6 bolts on the inner, and 6 bolts on the outer CV joint.  They
are all thay hold the axle/CV joints onto the bus.
