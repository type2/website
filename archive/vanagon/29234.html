 &gt; The bus came with copper
 &gt; tubing,  it works fine..   Steel would be harder to shape into the
 &gt; appropriate curve.   I have a source for OEM metal (yes, copper) lines for
 &gt; about $5 each.

My understanding is that so-called &quot;copper&quot; brake lines are actually a copper 
alloy specifically intended for high pressure hydraulic systems. &quot;Cuprifer&quot; is 
the trade name I seem to recall being bandied about on the britcar list.

Under no circumstances would I recommend using ordinary pure copper tubing, 
such as the stuff sold at your local hardware store as &quot;refrigeration tubing&quot;. 
 I bought a bunch once and it made a fine wort chiller, but brake lines?  Much 
too soft.
