Yeah, we all know of rip off suppliers.  We don't, however, all live in
California nor do we care to be shouted at.  Please try to learn the
position of your 'Caps Lock' key at the left of your keyboard and post to
this list in properly capitalized...  From what I understand, you do not
enjoy being spoken to in a rude and condescending manner, you should attempt
to appear competent in your communications.

I'm sorry to have singled you out with this posting.  It really is directed
to all people who try to use the list without knowing what they are doing.
If their ettiquette breaches are not pointed out to them early, it can lead
to a bad spam addiction.

Sorry to have wasted the time of those on the list who don't deserve this.




Cheers,
SStones
