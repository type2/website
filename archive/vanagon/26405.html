Subject: Re: Vans in europe?


&gt;&gt;&gt; An English friend of mine said there used to be a bridge in or
&gt;&gt;&gt; near London where traveling Australians would hang out, buying
&gt;&gt;&gt; and selling VW buses.  Apparently they got hounded out of
&gt;&gt;&gt; that area, but I'm sure they just moved somewhere else.  Any
&gt;&gt;&gt; UKers or Aussies know any more?

The Kombi market was by Jubilee park (or is it gardens?) by the river, at
least it was about five years ago when Ann washed up on our shore. I think
it moves every so often. Get hold of a copy of the Southern Cross, or else
go into any London pub and you can almost garauntee there'll be an
Aussie/Kiwi refugee behind the bar who'll know where it is.
