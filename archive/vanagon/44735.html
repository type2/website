Subject: Vanagon tire/wheel size

   TO The list:

      Can someone with a EV Check out the bolt pattern
      of the wheels, to see if they are the same as a 
      Vanagon. I would like to increase the tire size on
      my vanagon and I think that EV wheels maybe the 
      trick I need.

                 Thanks ERic ZEno
