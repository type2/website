How about Yosemite in Spring. They'll be lots of water, spectacular water 
falls, cool days, cooler nights, and HOT SHOWERS, Martha. (At Curry 
Village for $1, nice, clean, white tile.)

I have seen it snow in Yosemite in April, lightly, usaully, but late May 
would be almost sure fire nice weather. How about May 26, 27, 28. Or is 
that Memorial Day?
