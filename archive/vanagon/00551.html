&gt; ignition lock/cylinder from my scrap 1972 Super Beetle?

When I got my bus.... same thing.  Since the ignition and the door used 
the same key, I just took the door handle to a locksmith.  He looked up 
the number on the handle and made a key for $15.  Then I had him make a 
copy, just in case.  So, I think all you need is the number.  Then any 
decent locksmith can look it up and make a key.  I think mine was a 
letter and 4 numerals.
