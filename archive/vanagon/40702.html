Subject: '57 or '59 Panel for sale

Hello all,

A guy stopped me in the parking lot the other day apparently because of my
'67 (why does it only attract &quot;male&quot; grease jockeys) and asked me if I knew
anyone who wanted a '57 Panel. I said that only about 400 people I know
might &quot;want&quot; one.

He pulled out a picture and talked about all the work he has done to it.
He's one of us alright!

The vehicle had no rust or signs of repair of any kind and the paint is all
one color. It's missing a rear bumper and has a couple cosmetic dings that
show through to the outside from the cargo area. It has a low milage 1600
DP, new brakes, and 12V conversion according to the owner. He mentioned
$3500, then said he might be convinced to lower that for a VW lover. I
thought of all of you.

The picture he gave me said '57, but he wrote '59 on his business card. I
would be willing to look at this vehicle for any of you expressing
interest.


Regards, Jim
