Subject: Re: Heater Exhaust Pipe: a recall

&gt; 
&gt; most of you old folks and gopher-able people may have seen this, but i
&gt; thought it might be worth posting to the list again. i was looking for
&gt; the head-torque on the water-cooled engines, and noticed the one about
&gt; the auxillary heater exhaust pipe that someone was talking about. so
&gt; everybody take a minute and look through here if you have a vanagon of
&gt; any year. you might find something.

&gt;      Campaign ES            Notification Date:     800729
&gt;      System:                Heating; Heater Exhaust Pipe
&gt;      Vehicle Description:   Vans equipped with auxiliary heaters
&gt;      Description of Defect: The auxiliary heater's exhaust pipe is
&gt;                             mounted in a downward position toward the
&gt;                             ground.
&gt;      Consequence of Defect: In the event the vehicle is parked in an
&gt;                             area with dry material (grass) beneath it,
&gt;                             the downflow of exhaust could reach the
&gt;                             material and possibly ignite it.  A vehicle
&gt;                             fire and personal injury could result.
&gt;      Corrective Action:     Dealer will remove the existing pipe and
&gt;                             install a modified pipe with a shield over

I stand corrected. 8-(  Although I _still_ think a venturi effect
applies.  Boy, some people just don't know when to admit when
they're wrong 8-).

Thanks for the info, Joel.
