Subject: Diff. Lock 86 Syncro?
Date: Fri, 22 Nov 96 12:29:00 CDT


I'm happy to report my 86 Syncro is back on the road after a long wait and a 
partial transmission rebuild.

Now, I have another concern.  The differnetial lock light has been on 1/2 of 
the time since putting the van back on the road.  The trans company tested 
to be sure there is adaquate vacuum pressure - it tested OK, they also 
checked the wires and they seemed alright as well.  After their tests, I was 
able to turn off the lock by pulling the switch in and out a few times. 
 That was last night, I drove about 30 miles and all was well.  This morning 
when I started her cold (about 25 degree F) the light was on  and I was 
unable to turn it off as I did yesterday.  I drove it on dry pavement about 
8 miles.

The guy who did the trans work said he thought it could be attributed to a 
new 'O' ring placed on the diff lock valve and it will work it's way out in 
a few days.  He also said that the diff lock is only responsible for the 
rear wheels so it shouldn't be harmful to drive it on dry pavement for a 
while.  I understood otherwise - that the vehicle should never be driven on 
dry pavement with a locked diff.

Snow is supposed to dump here tonight, so that's good, but I want to have 
this taken care of before the roads are cleared.

Any suggestions?

Thanks
