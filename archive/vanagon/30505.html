J. One of my older buses had the same problem of the rusted up heat 
exchangers and cables. Aquick fix until the spring is to get underneath 
with some &quot;chickwire&quot; and wire the heat exchangers in the open position. 
Also check for rust holes in the heat exchangers themselves  and patch 
them up with some duck tape. I did this one winter and managed to produce 
some decent heat.

			Good Luck
