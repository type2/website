Subject:  re:VANAGON digest 816 

Just a similar sentiment form a relatively new lurker.
I'd like to read this list, and learn more about my van, but the
volume is just too large. I notice a lot of people quote a lot of articles
which increases size of files. My mailer will only take the first 30K, and
I've yet to get to the end of a Digest.

&gt;Hiya,
&gt;
&gt;Been reading the list for about 3-5 weeks now and have learned a little,
&gt;have wanted to contribute aplenty and am now just about ready to bail. Why?
&gt;Just too much traffic.
