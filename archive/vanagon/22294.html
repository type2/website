Subject:       Goodbye my dear '67...

Well, going against all that I hold sacred, I sold the '67 Deluxe last 
Saturday to a little punk kid that had to pawn his guitar to come up 
with the last $100.

So, to my first Volkswagen I bid thee farewell.  You were always the 
classiest ride in town.  And most assuredly the best looking Deluxe 
in the area.

So no longer will I be able to coast out of the driveway because you 
didn't have reverse.  Gone is that troublesome 1600dp that was always 
hot.  Goodbye to my tie-dye t-shirt seat covers.

Now the '57 23-Window will attempt to fill in that space in my heart 
that you did--but it will be hard!

Joel, make me a one bus owner good friend!
