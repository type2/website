&gt; It was a fabulous trip. Susie and I reviewed the video, the shots of
&gt; Bradley's bus rock jumping in the canyon were excellent. If there is another
&gt; bash at Martha's I will bring the tape or I will try to frame grab some shots
&gt; and somehow get them out there for people to see.

The film that I bought on the way to Red Rock mysteriously disappeard, so
I didn't get any pictures of the weekend, but if anyone can mail me
pictures, I will scan them and put them on the web.  I think I also have
the resources to convert video to quicktime/mpeg movies, so video
submissions would be welcomed!  Please e-mail me privately if you can
supply me with pictures or videos...
