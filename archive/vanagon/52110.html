OK, so pull your pants back up and come out from behind the shrubbery. ;)

Chains are a pain to install when stuck, the roll into or jack'em up methods
are slow and maybe dangerous, but if you are stopped it's going to be the
jack method.  If not... I carry 2 short bits of 2x6, with 2 bits of 3/4&quot; ply
nailed on leaving an inch wide gap between.  Lay them on the ground, put a
cross bar of the chain in the gap between ply and drive onto the blocks.
This way the chains can be wrestled around easily while the van is securely
parked and the connectors etc snugged down.  I usuall don't have any
loosening up after driving, lot easier than getting soaked/frozen again.  Tim
