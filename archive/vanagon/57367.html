Subject: Recall Information
Date: Wed, 19 Mar 1997 13:26:59 -0800

I was checking out the 'Vanagon Recall Information' FAQ &amp; I've
determined that my '87 Vanagon GL Wolfs. falls within some of the
affected VINs on four of recall campaigns (SU, PW, PB &amp; PG).  I'm the
3rd owner &amp; unfortunately, the 2nd owner's documents left to me did not
mention whether or not my Vanagon had ever been to the dealer for any
'corrective actions'. 

My question(s):

1)  Since I'm the third owner, is the recall still in affect where I can
take it to my local VW dealership for the necessary 'corrective
actions'?

2)  How can I determine whether my Vanagon has already been through the
'corrective actions' for each particular recall campaign?

3)  If determined that I can still take my Vanagon to the VW dealership
for the repairs &amp; that my Vanagon has not already been repaired, is it
as simple as calling them to make an appointment for the repairs?  Will
the VW Dealership hassle me about repair costs?  

Any information would be greatly appreciated.
