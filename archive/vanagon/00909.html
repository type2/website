Re: fine tuning electrical/12 volt systems
------------------------------------------------

Those who are in the marine/yachting/sailing field often know a great 
deal about optimizing 12 volt power systems. They must....they live on 
them at sea.

Some extremely well written books on the topic are available in a number 
of sailing/yachting stores.

For example:

Wiring 12 Volts for Ample Power
David Smead and Ruth Ishihara
Rides Publishing Company
2442 NW Market Street #43
Seattle, Washington 98107


also good by these people, even better is:

 Living on 12 Volts with Ample Power


Lots of schematics, sources of 12 volt tweaking supplies, lists, etc. etc.
