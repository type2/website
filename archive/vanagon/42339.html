Subject: 86' Rough running
Date: Fri, 17 May 1996 17:48:02 -0400 (EDT)

I'm back to the list with troubles again.  I posted a message
last thursday about my van running rough after replacing the
muffler.  The van had been running smoothly before the muffler
incident.  I got some useful replies (thanks Joel and Mike) in
regard to the how to fix it aspect of my post.  
	Today i got the van back from the dealer, not as bad as
it sounds.  It cost me twenty dollars to have the engine specs
set.  They claim that everything else looked good.
Unfortunately this was not the fix as it is running rough
again, really rough now. Although acceleration is sluggish, it
is not jumpy.  It seems as though it is on the verge of
shooting a banana out the tailpipe and then running fine (I do
not expect that this will be the solution, however)  Is it possible
 that they got it
running pretty well with some new settings and that the engine
is off again due to the O2 sensor sending bad info to the brain
(Joel i probably should have replaced the O2 sensor as you
suggested).  Also, if it is the O2 sensor, do I also have to
replace the cat???
	I have also tried some other avenues.  I added some dry
gas just in case that was the culprit.  I had a nearly full
tank when the muffler went bad and haven't filled up since.  
The idle is steady, oddly enough, so i have ruled out
the thermostat sender??  I have also checked for corroded
grounds and other corrupted connections and everything looks
ok.  My plugs are relatively new (december), but maybe i should
replace them anyway.  I also have a new fuel filter/pump and
the air flow harness device.  
	I scanned the archives and found a lot of good info,
but, alas, i am still back at square one.

If anyone has any suggestions or can point me in the direction
of a particulary useful archive i will be forever thankful (not
to say that i am not already)
