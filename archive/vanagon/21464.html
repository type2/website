Subject: curious about campers

I've been wondering about changing my 79 bus into a camper.  I have
access to a Westfalia pop-top, so I'm on the way there.  Did campers
roll off the assembly line at Wolfsburg or did busses get shipped to
Westfalia(a company??) to be changed to campers.  If they were shipped
to Westfalia, it seems that all they did was cut out part of the 
roof, install the top, seal it, and install the refrig and sink.


 Is my logic anywhere close to correct?
Paul
