Subject: Re: A/C compressor not turning

&gt;This weekend I tried the A/C and I noticed the engine didn't change
&gt;speed when the compressor supposedly kicks in. Sure enough, when the 
&gt;A/C is switched on, the compressor clutch didn't engage.

&gt;Outside temperature was 70F so the temp sensors should have allowed the 
&gt;compressor to engage.

&gt;Before I have it looked at by a professional, does anyone have
&gt;any suggestions or recommendations? I welcome all thoughts and opinons
&gt;since my A/C knowldge is very limited. 

Is this the first time you've tried to run the A/C in some time?  I'd be
willing to bet that over time or through some unknown incident the freon has
evaporated from the system.  There is a safety switch in the A/C system that
does not allow the compressor to engage if the pressure in the system is too
low, thus preventing damage to the system.  One quick check is to find the
fill valve (it looks like a valve stem on your tire) and press on the valve
to release a little pressure.  If nothing is released when you do this, then
the freon has escaped from the system.  At this point you have to find out
why, rather than just recharging the system.  This usual requires a mechanic,
unfortunately.  With this in mind, it might be a good time to upgrade the
entire A/C system to the new ozone-friendly refrigerant.
