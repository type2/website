  &lt;&lt; &gt; well, if you got an '87 westy, and want to put a middle seat
  outta a 7
  pass
   &gt;&gt; van into your westy, have you ever looked under the carpet mat
  in your
  cargo
   &gt;&gt; floor?
   &gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt; you should have 2 filler strips in tracks in the formica floor,
  already
  in
   &gt;&gt; there for this purpose. This is if you have a westy GL. (WWW's
  don't have
   &gt;&gt; this)
   &gt;&gt; Remove the filler strips, and slide in the seat.
   &gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt; It MUST be rocket science....

   &gt;Hey, two assholes in one day!  You and Tim must be those Siamese
  twins
   &gt;separated at birth.  Or maybe you're both just proof that
  late-term
   &gt;partial abortions are a bad thing.
   &gt;
   &gt;Yes I've lifted the fucking carpet and no there aren't any tracks;

   &gt;hence, the confusion you fucking assholes. &gt;&gt;

  Well, now,  aren't we chipper!  :&lt;)
  oh, and I do agree that LT abortions are a bad thing, but that's
  another
  topic for another list...
  you still haven't stated if you have a full westy or not.
  I know in '85, on the full GL westy's  there were the filler strips
  in tracks
  in the floor.
  these filler strips were here for the very reason of sliding in a
  middle
  seat.
  Now, I haven't looked under the carpet in a '87 or other year westy
  GL's
  recently, but I don't see why it should be any different.

  please state if you have a westy GL or not.

  Oh, and by the way, you have a nice day!  :&lt;)

 My non Westi '81 has the two strips that hold the middle seat in place
after removing the fiberboard. Oh by the way dont tell me to have a nice
day, I wont have one if I dont want to.  ;&lt;)
