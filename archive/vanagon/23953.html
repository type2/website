                               VW Vandals

About 1989 my little brother borrowed my '79 VW van so he could get to work
for a week or two.  He had a temporary job as a bouncer and doorman at a
nightclub. (He's got a university degree, even!)  One night, these two young
vatos came in, showed him their fake I.D.s  He wouldn't let them in and kept
their fake I.D.s in his collection.  They made some threats.  My LB, backed
up by two or three hulks who worked there, nonchalantly told them to take a
hike.

Apparently, they decided to get even and lurked in the shadows as he left
work that night, noting the van he was driving (I'm assuming they could
write).  The next night, when he was leaving work, he noticed that all the
windows in the van had been smashed with a baseball bat or something.

I took the van to the local VW fix-it shop (NOT the VW dealer).  The VW
fix-it guy happened to have a breadloaf van in his junkyard, so for $200 he
agreed to replace all the glass and rubber.  (My brother still owes me about
half of that, the little deadbeat.)  After that, LB bummed a ride from
someone else or I dropped him off at work.

Anyway, the story has kind of a happy(?) ending.  On their fake I.D.s,
supposedly from Georgia or wherever, they used their real dates of birth
(plus a couple or three years) and street addresses, so they wouldn't get
confused when questioned by bouncers or convenience store clerks.  So
happens, my brother-in-law here is the Chief of Police.  He sent officers
out to question these punks and generally put the fear of God into them.
But the punks got their lawyers (what would we do without these saints?) to
spring them.  Apparently they'd had a few dozen scrapes with the law before
and knew exactly who to call.

One of these guys who smashed the windows was convicted of murdering someone
in an argument a year or so later and he's now doing life in the luxurious
Texas Department of Corrections.  No sh*t.  He didn't get a chance to ride
Ol' Sparky but I don't know which is worse.  I don't know about the other
one but I'm willing to bet that he's done some time for something since then.

So, anyway, if punks like this continue their aberrant form of behaviour,
it's  likely that they'll get it back in spades, sooner or later.  They'll
be gettin' it in prison before you can say &quot;Squeal like a little piggy now!&quot;

Instant karma's gonna get you....!
