Subject: brakes,louise.

I think the problem you have is in the rear brakes-shoes. It is possible
that the calipers could stick,too of course, but most likely  would be a
gradual thing, and cause premature pad wear or pulling. The rear brakes are
probably out of adjustment,or if self-adjusting, something is stuck or
broken. I can't believe you live without power assist on that thing. It
makes two worlds of difference. I think you should re attach the vacuum,
repair the booster, or whatever is involved-you won't believe the
difference.

Yours,
yug
