&gt;  My '91 has the central door locks, but the tailgate is not in the 
&gt;      system.  The gate has obviously been replaced and the door lock is a 
&gt;      different key.  I've seen the drawing/diagram of the rear hatch remote

&gt;      locking mechanism.
&gt;      
&gt;      Question 1:  Does the remote locking mechanism require a special door 
&gt;      latch, or are they all the same (with a mechanical connection for the 
&gt;      remote mechanism)?

Yes.  I added aftermarket PDL to my 87 and after hours of considering
alternative ways to attach a power actuator to the manual latch assembly
(inside the hatch), I gave up.  I thought of several different ways, but none
that I would care to have in my van.  I started searching for a PDL latch at
wrecking yards.  I finally found one.  I had to buy the WHOLE HATCH!  The
wrecker wouldn't sell parts out of it separately.  I wanted the wiper
mechanism too, so it wasn't too bad.  Still MUCH cheaper than the dealer.   
   
&gt;      Question 2:  Anyone on the list have the pieces I'm missing for sale?
 
&gt;      (I'm assuming at this point that the wires haven't been hacked) 

No.  Good luck with your search.
