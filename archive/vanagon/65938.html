Does anyone know this for sure.  Not anecdotal evidence but scientific ( I
will settle for pseudo scientific) evidence.  I recently had my fridge
serviced at an RV place that knew the 182B backwards and forwards.  They
really impressed me with their ability and knowledge.  I asked them about
the fan since they had some for sale.  They said that you don't need it for
the 182B (thus denying themselves a sale of a fan to me).  I must admit it
works well without it (although I haven't tried making ice cubes).

Does anyone out there have any data on this?
