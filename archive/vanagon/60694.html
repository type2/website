Subject: Re: Rear hatch lock revisited - a sidebar question

     All-
     
     My '91 has the central door locks, but the tailgate is not in the 
     system.  The gate has obviously been replaced and the door lock is a 
     different key.  I've seen the drawing/diagram of the rear hatch remote 
     locking mechanism.
     
     Question 1:  Does the remote locking mechanism require a special door 
     latch, or are they all the same (with a mechanical connection for the 
     remote mechanism)?
     
     Question 2:  Anyone on the list have the pieces I'm missing for sale?  
     (I'm assuming at this point that the wires haven't been hacked)
     
     THX
