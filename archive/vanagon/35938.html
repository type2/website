&gt; then you might want to have a map of how to get there from here ... or maybe
&gt; just a map to show what's where when you are there. in either case, this is
&gt; a neat place that has all sorts of maps that you can't usually find in the
&gt; bookstore:
&gt; 
&gt; Map Link                          maps of the world, u.s., canada,
&gt; 25 East Mason Street              mexico, and nearly all other countries
&gt; Santa Barbara,  CA  93101         around the globe, city maps, and some
&gt; (805) 965-4402                    topological maps of the u.s., canada,
&gt; (800) 627-7768 FAX toll-free.     mexico, france, britian, and some
&gt; catalog $3.00                     others. neat stuff for map freaks.
&gt; 
&gt; they take credit cards and are nice folks to deal with. :)

Speaking of maps...

Anyone ever use any of those CD-ROM maps that are out there?  Wondering how 
well they print.
