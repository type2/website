Subject: Re: Tune Up Question: Distributor &amp; Timing

&gt;&gt;Yo
&gt;I don't have a degree pulley. I've seen them advertised--are they easy to
&gt;install without taking everything apart, or do I have to wait until I take
&gt;the engine out...?

 To install a degree pulley requires that you remove the tin (small piece
 in front of your pulley) then put engine in 1st, vice grip or whatever
 the pulley so it won't move and with an appropriate size sock or wrench
 remove the nut holding it on.  Then it's just a matter of removing the 
 old pulley (WATCH FOR THE 'KEY'..a half round piece of metal that slips
 in a groove on your pulley that keeps it from free wheeling) and put on 
 the new. easy...
&gt;
&gt;At this point I only have the notch and have no idea where to locate 5
&gt;degrees...I could guess, but that would be cheating... also, I found out
&gt;today that I have a Bosh009 distributor...does this make a diff?
&gt;
The 009 is very different from the stock.  It is set by total advance at 
2500-3000 rpm. The specs are 32 degrees BTDC _at_ 2500-3000rpm and 7.5 degrees
ATDC at idle.  Get a piece of masking tape.  On one side make two marks
7/16 inches apart...that's 7.5degrees  On the other side make two marks
1 7/8 inches apart...that's 32degrees.  Next place the tape with the 7/16
marks (7.5deg.) on top of the rim of the pulley so that one mark is on TDC
and the other mark is to the left of TDC. Put a mark on your pulley.
Next flip the tape over and again place it on the rim of the pulley so that
on mark of the 32degrees is on TDC and the other is to the RIGHT of TDC. Put
another mark on your pulley.  Run the engine up to 3000rpm and move the dist.
so the 32deg. mark lines up with the crack, let the engine drop to 6-800rpm
at idle and check the timing...should be at 7.5BTDC.

Good Luck....
Martin
