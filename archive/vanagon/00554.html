Subject: Re: electrical ideas (wild theories and other natural pheno

It's my turn to chime in I guess (or something like that!!!

Speaking of electrical power, I've tried several ideas. I have one
success and have been apparently SCREWED once. I thought I'd share.

As I've mentioned, I have a '93 Eurovan and removed the 6-pack coller and
replaced it with a DC/AC refrigerator (same manufacture as the 6-pack model). 
The power requirement is about the same.

It works very well while driving. It also works well in a campground for
about two to three days (after that time, it wears the auxilliary battery
down) without using the main battery or engine.

I've been trying to convince some of the younger generation to go camping
with us so every now and then I break down and take a &quot;pampering toy&quot; (aka
microwave [600 volts] for popcorn) or other power consuming gadgets.

To compensate for the extra use of power, I purchased a 1200 volt invereter
made by Tripp Light of Chicago. I called myself doing some homework and
determined that nothing I had would take more than 1000 volts and was
well under the amperage of the inverter. To my surprise, the inverter
would not supply enough power for the microwave (nothing else was on-line) and
barely heated a single-burner hot plate. Upon trying to get help from the
RV dealer (purchasing source in Northern Virginia) I have had a nightmare.

Initially, the dealer refused to cooperate or assist at all. I contacted
Tripp Light in Chicago and they flat refused to refund my money.  They offered
to inspect or repair the unit, if I shipped it to them (at my expense). Well
I've shipped it three times and upon each return it has not worked.
Tripp Light's alibis are getting weaker and weaker but they keep insisting
that some thing is wrong on my end but they could get the dealer to assist.

I've had automotive electrical specialists and electrical engineers check
the automotive electrical system and the microwave and they certify
nothing is wrong, other than the inverter. I won't let them open the
inverter due to the warranty being in iexistence.

I eventually sought help from the Virginia State Consumer Protection
Service. The local dealer then agreed to 'test' the unit and try it with
the microwave, in their testing laboratory. The dealer managed to get a
small container of water from cold to slightly hot in 5 minutes. The
dealer has said that seems about right to them so I'm in a battle which
now will probably wind in up court; the manufacturer (Tripp Light) has
completely removed from the picture or any obligation for their product.
(All of you campers might want take notice of this manufacturer). I initially
had inquired of both the dealer and manufacturer before I purchased this
brand and model. I purchased based on their recommendation.

Forgive me if I seem to be crying my tears out here or asking for sympathy,
I am not, but I think it fair to explain and warn any others who may be niave
and as trusting as I was.

My second venture was to purchase a Honda model EX1000 generator. THAT
seems to be a success. It is VERY quiet and light-weight (feels like
moving a small, portable sewing machine) and has adequately provided the
power for everything I've tried with it, including BOTH the microwave and hot
plate at the same time. I don't plan to use both at the same time from the
generator but I wanted to see how good was good or where I should draw the
line, trying to get 'extra' power.

In my younger days I enjoyed &quot;roughing it&quot;. Lately, I've adopted a
&quot;roughing it, Smooothly&quot; attitude and I had to make some concessions to
the younger generation (game boys, portable computers, disc players, extra
lights, curlers, etc.) to get them out with us. I'm very interested in
conversations here that will give this &quot;dude&quot; some ideas about how to handle
power requirements without jeopardizing the starting-power of the van.

If this seemed long-winded, again, I ask for your patience. I generally
don't have much to say but I'm hoping this will generate more ideas and
conversation(s).
