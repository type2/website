Subject: Re: rebuilt heads

I just had two rebuilt heads installed on my '80 Westy.  Not a cheap 
endeavor.  Apparently the 2.0L has a chronic problem of dropping valve 
seats.  One of mine was dropped, cracked, and burned.  The mechanic showed 
me the head.  Not a pretty site.  The crack didn't become visible until they 
sandblasted the old head to see if I would get my core charge back.

Getting someone to help for just some beer sounds like a good deal.  There 
was an article in either Hot VW or T&amp;A about installing extra strong valve 
seats in Type IV heads last month or the month before.

Motor sounds a lot better with even compression.  The one with the dropped 
valve was running around 5 PSI.  Now all I have to do is find a FI problem.  
It appears to be running too rich now.  But at least I have compression.
