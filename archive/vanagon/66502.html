Same problem on the new clutch in my '91. Replaced it in July with Canadian
Sachs. Originally great, now it has significant shudder. Perhaps Sachs Sucks.

I was wondering how many of you are having this problem.&lt;snip&gt; a real bad
chatter that shows up after 30 to 120 days and occurs only when hot. I have
been able to get Sachs to admit there is a problem but so far they have only
replaced one disc. At first they said we were the only ones that were having
trouble!

Thanks for the help,

Brian
