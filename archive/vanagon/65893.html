Subject:      Loose arm rests

     Maybe I'm missing some technique, but I thought I'd ask.

     The arm rests on my '91 just won't stay tight.

     I've removed all of them more than once to tighten the screws (stupid
     design!).  I've even used Loctite on the threads.

     We don't abuse them (like try to slide around them when getting in the
     car).

     Have only had the car since mid-May.

     I've thought about getting out the dremel and grinding a dimple in the
     edge of the bracket's countersunk hole, then peening the screw head.

     Any other ideas?  (Respond off-list and I'll summarize)

     TIA
