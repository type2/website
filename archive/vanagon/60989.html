Subject: Re: ?G2 on G60 Corrado?

The G60 engine is equipped with a G-force supercharger which has 
inherently bad bearings.  That's why VW opted not to use that 
supercharger anymore, and aftermarket companies now offer a turbocharger 
replacement system which although is not as responsive, is more efficient 
in the top end.

&gt; &gt;Does anyone have an opinion, on the '91 Corrado. By the way, if I buy, it
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; To which I say (ask):  uhm, excuse me, but if the SO thinks it's
&gt; tough on the back with a Scirocco and 14 m/o Tersa, how will it
&gt; get better with a Corrado and 14 m/o Tersa?...  'Sorry, been there,
&gt; done that,...next!
&gt; 
&gt; What you really want to do is go hunt around for a first year,
&gt; Flash Red (or is it Tornado Rot?) Jetta3 GLX.  I think they
&gt; came out in the '95 model year.  Granted, it's (probably) not
&gt; priced as right as a '90 or '91 G60 Corrado, but it will have
&gt; four, count'em, 4, doors AND it'll have that VR6 motor...
&gt; 
&gt; Hey, want to buy our '91 GLI?  Four doors, VERY RED, very fast,
&gt; already has a couple of child seats in it...   ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Have fun shopping for your SO's new ride!
