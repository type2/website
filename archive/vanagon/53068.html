Subject: East Coast Summer Trip

  Howdy all. With all this exciting talk by our active CCC chapter, and now the
North Centralers chiming in, I thought I'd unveil the concept for the East
Coast Summer Run that some of us have been working on.
 The weekend of May 30-June 1 is going to be the third annual Busses on the
Blue Ridge Parkway, a NEATO sponsored event. I went last year as the jumping
off point for my cross-country jaunt. There were about 60 busses, over half of
which were splits. It was a really great weekend of VW camaraderie. (There's a
write up on my web page if you're interested) They do a truly awesome caravan
along the parkway. Nothing improves the gorgeous scenic mountain road like a
train of busses chugging along!
 Anyway, From there, over the next week, we're going to take scenic NC back
roads to the coast, and do some camping on the Outer Banks. It would be a week
of leisurely bus travel, from the mountains to the coast, with the emphasis on
both ends. As a native of NC, I can vouch for the miles and miles of smooth,
well kept, yet highly under-traveled beautiful by-ways and back roads of the
state.
 This trip would basically require a week off from work, but coupled with
surrounding week-ends will hopefully provide enough bussing to soothe the
jones, without endangering the trusty employment, which didn't take too kindly
to last year's 6 week endeavor.
So, if this sounds like the thing for you, please join in!  Busses on the
Parkway is a go regardless of this, and is entirely separate. I recommend you
go to that, even if you can't do the after-trip. Mark those calendars now!!!!!
