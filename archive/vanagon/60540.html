&gt; It appears to have been caused by a loose distributor and a timing gone

&gt; Me, my husband (who is on his way home) and our daughter thanks all.

Unfortunately not quite home yet. This is Phil in the flesh so to speak. 
I relented yesterday and brought the van to a shop where they puzzled 
over it for a few hours before calling in the boss, Franz. (No kidding)
 
He soon had the loose distributor clamped down and the timing fixed and I 
was on my way. This morning I awoke to the same no start problem. I 
grasped the dis. cap and turned it (there was a small amount of play that 
seems normal?) The van started O.K. Drove about 200 miles with acouple of 
stops/restarts no problem  but it died on the hiway once again and would 
not restart. 
 
Could there be something wrong with the &quot;guts&quot; of the distributor?
(Luckily I've broken down near internet access. The tow operator thought 
it strange to bring me to the library) I'm stil 200 miles from home. I 
have Bently with me. And am about to start taking things apart. Any 
suggestions.
