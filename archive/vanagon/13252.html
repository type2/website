Subject: Re: Front CV (Black and) Blues

Is changing front CVs on a Syncro as rudimentary as the early 
&gt;'70s type I (rear) CVs? 

The outer end is splined onto the hub, I seem to remember from Bentley that 
you have to disconnect a piece of suspension arms (and swing it out of the 
way) before pulling out the axle. The inner end is the usual 6 bolt deal. My 
'87 joints are quiet, but have been rebooted with solid (not split) boots 
sometime in their life. Thus complete removal/disassembly/repack. The boots 
are heavier grade polyethylene type, not rubber. Please post how this task 
was when you are done, thanks.    tim s.

One note of caution, unlike the rear CVs, don't roll the vehicle about when 
the front CVs are out, the CV supports the wheel bearings which you could 
damage.
