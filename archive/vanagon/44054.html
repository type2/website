Subject: Ghia question 

        Does anyone in the Alberta vicinity know where I could go and take
a look at a Karma Ghia? My girlfriend loves them and a picture just wasn't
enough so she wondered if anyone around here had one. Mucho Appreciano is
ya know of any.

        On a lighter note: Anyone ever thought about marketing one of those
Chia pets shaped like a Karma Ghia and calling it a...yes you guessed
it...a Ghia Pet!!!!
        Or even a VW Chia pet would be neat. You could grow grass out of
the roof of your van and never get busted.  :)

thanks for reading my mindless drivel.
