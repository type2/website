Subject: Coolant hose blew off!

On our way to get some Margaritas tonight, the large hose that attaches
to the thermostat housing on our 88 came off. The first thing we noticed
was mist on the rear window as we were heading down the interstate. The
temp guage and light stayed in the OK range. When we pulled over I took
the engine of and noticed the hose had come off the thermstat housing. We
put the hose back on and filled and bled the cooling system on the side
of the road as best as we could aand everything seemed to be alright.
Could the thermostst have gotten stuck? Or was I just having a bad day?
Is my newly rebuilt engine toast? If it is I guess I had some very
expensive margaritas8)
