DON&quot;T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!

There is a point where you have to draw the line in your VW thriftiness and
welding or patching a weak high-pressure tank is well-beyond that line. Check
an RV shop, CNG shop, Propane dealer, or Bus Depot for a replacement. A
couple hundred buck is a small price to pay for piece of mind, and all your
limbs.

Safe travels,
