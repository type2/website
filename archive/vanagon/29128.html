Subject: Contact for VDO Gauges

VDooers:

Don Geiger thoughtfully provided the new telephone number
for FE VDO Headquarters in Winchester, Virginia.

I called, talked with machine # 1, &lt;press one for
automotive&gt;, talked with machine # 2, &lt;press four for
catalogs&gt;, talked with machine #3 &lt;literature&gt; and left name
and address on voice mail.  Will advise when or if catalog
arrives.

For the gauge tekkies, there is also *press something* for
marine and *press something else* for aircraft(?).  Somehow
this must tie in to the Do They Float thread or the Do They
Fly thread. :)

I am particularly looking forward to the in-dash, four-wheel
constant-monitor tire-pressure gauges.  I forgot....might
need five of those!
