&gt;Have any of you out there tried &quot;true&quot; snow tires on your vans? Are there
&gt;van versions of Nokia Hakkapalittas available?
  
I bought a pair of rims when my Vanagon was new (in Colorado) and have 
always kept a set of studded snow tires on them.  With them on the Van is 
like a half track in snow and does okay on ice.  I still use them for 
occasional snow and ski trips here in Washington (St.).  I have take 
multi-thousand mile trips with them on but usually I just swap them out for 
a couple of months or a bad storm.  I use standard radial snow tires, not 
high pressure rating and run them at 35+ psi.  I also use a set of cables 
(chains, not).

What the heck is a Nokia Hakkapalittas?
