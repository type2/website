I repaired the seal on our 74 by scraping out the rotten clips and glueing 
it back in place using Loctite Superbonder. Be careful not to use excessive 
amounts of adhesive. Just do a little at a time. I used spring clamps to 
hold it in place then peeled back and glued about 12 inches at a time. 
ALERT- Superbonder is a fast anaerobic adhesive IT WILL GLUE YOU TO THE ROOF 
OR YOURSELF IN SECONDS

|        I know I asked about this once before but I never really figured
|out what I should do about it.
|The Problem: My black rubber seal that goes around the bottom of the
|pop-top peice is starting to rot (or a least in spots it is) and peel off.
|        I called the dealership and the replacement is $533. There is no
|way in hell that I would ever pay that so.......has anyone done this repair
|before? I was hoping that I could simply peel off the exsisting
|one...scrape off all the gunk and junk, then reglue it on.
|
|        Inquire mind would like to know.
