&gt; We're loading the EV onto the boat tomorrow nite and heading to
&gt; the island...home of the Teddy Kennedy Swim-with-your-back-brace-in-
&gt; a-drunken-fog Marathon.....
&gt; 
&gt; Martha's Vinyard...and its smaller appendage..Chappaquidik
&gt; 
&gt; 
Speaking of which... wasn't there a VW ad circa 1969 which  went something
like this: &quot;if Ted Kennedy owned a VW beetle he would be president today&quot;.
The ad was touting the bug's ability to float because of its air-sealed
compartment....

Has  anyone tried to find out if Vanagon's float? I suspect buses do....
