Hey, avery

When the Custom Officials arrest your butt, can I be your lawyer?

Jeeeeeessssuuuuuuussssss! Why does every twit (sorry) think that
the customs types at the border are stupid? Or that they have
the idea of the century to bring in  uncertified cars to the
US??

Let me give you a quick story. You all know who Bill Gates is, right?
He has a Porsche 959 (you all remember the Porsche supercar from
the early 1980s) that is sitting in a warehouse because he
can't get it into the country legally. Here is a guy who has, what,
Billions of $$$$....and for all he's worth, he can't even buy
the access to the US for his car. So get a clue!

Also one other thing...affixing a VIN from one car to another is a
Federal offense! Punishable by making you share a cell with a
large 300 pound male named &quot;Bull&quot;, and who will gladly refer
to you as &quot;Peaches&quot;. After you have picked up the bar of soap
in the shower a few times, you may come to realize that changing
a VIN number and assuming the Customs Officers are stupid, may 
not have been a smart move.

Ahhhh, thank you .... I feel better now.
