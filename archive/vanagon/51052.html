Subject: Mouse Droppings &amp; Disease Info
Date: 29 Oct 96 01:03:34 GMT

Some straight info on what's being referenced here.  Just contacted 
the Environmental Health department in my county.  We've had 2 cases.
In the western US there is a disease called Hanta virus.  
It is contracted by breathing dry mouse poop from the mice that act as 
carriers.  Sweeping up dry mouse poop breaks up the dung releasing 
the dry stuff to be blown around and then breathed.

Checked my house furnace ventilation, found mice poop, yuch!, 
wanted to get correct info on cleanup from experts, thought I'd pass 
it on, since it was brought up.

Most cases tracked to eastern Sierra Nevada from the Susanville to 
Bishop area, or contracted there and then reported elsewhere.

Take note attendees of the recent camping trip in Mammoth.
This is not an alarm, but to make you all aware of possibilites.

The virus itsef is relatively weak and can be de-activated by getting 
it wet with a weak disinfectant such as bleach, Lysol, or rubbing 
alcohol.  The experts haven't tested to see how long it can survive 
in the environment.  ACS&amp;R team take note on cleaning of rescuees.

Cleanup techniques - Get it wet with a mild disinfectant, let it sit 
for at least 10 minutes to deactivate virus. Clean it up.  Another good 
precaution is to wear a dust mask or respirator and gloves.
Ventilate thoroughly after disinfecting to keep THAT stuff from 
harming you too.

Symptoms - Typical respiratory system symptoms such as
shortness of breath, severe muscle cramping , abdominal cramping,
respiratory pneumonia resulting in severe lung infection.
1-6 weeks onset time from time of contact.

If you were in environment that could have this &amp; develop flu in 
about 6 weeks ask your doctor.
The mortality rate for this disease is 25-50%.

So far only doctors in the area this is found are aware of the 
disease.  If you have any doubts, tell you doctor that you suspect 
Hanta Virus, tests are available.

Cleaning or working in areas that have large quantities of mouse 
droppings and in an enclosed space are when one contacts this 
disease.

&gt; &gt;*Careful* with that mouse poop! Seriously, someone died last year
&gt; &gt;from cleaning up around mouse poop. Seems that inhaling it can result
