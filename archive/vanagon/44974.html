Subject: Eurovans- to buy or not to buy

I have an '85 Vanagon Camper that is getting over the hill and was interested
in the Eurovan.  I notice only 1993s available, and they mention a
&quot;Weekender&quot; package.  Is this comparable to the Vanagon's camper package, ie.
stove,sink, frig, poptop, etc?  Why no '94 on models?  What about
reliability, or other general information?  Any feedback would be greatly
appreciated!
