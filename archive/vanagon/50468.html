Subject: 85':loss of power (after warms up?)


Hi all,

Any initial thoughts on what is up with my (recently overhauled) 85?  
Runs fine for a few miles/minutes, then loses power, so that it can 
hardly make it up these North Carolina mountain hills (downshifting going 
up hills doesn't rev the engine like it should).

All comments welcome!
