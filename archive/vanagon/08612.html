&gt;Well today he sold it to me.......for $5.00 :) :) :)!! It is a Grundig
&gt;AM/FM/SW radio, all complete and working in VG condition.

Michael,

you lucky dog...I wouldn't mind having a Grundig AM/FM/SW radio for the
car.  Especially for 5 bucks.  My desktop one is juuuust a bit too big
to fit anywhere but in its own seat (with seatbelt *and* airbag, of
course!  ;^)

Happy Christmas, y'all.  (OK, try to imagine a Germano-Brit with a Texas
drawl...)
