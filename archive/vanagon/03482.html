I removed the socket from my dash and had a good look at it. Within the
socket is a second smaller socket with what looks like a contact point. A
single constant 12 volt line runs to the back. The ground is the dash
itself...the idea that it may be a charging system sounds interesting.
For example we know that later westy's came with a second battery
(starting which year). Maybe in earlier yeasr it was offered as an option.

The fact that it is only on the aircooled versions makes me suspeect that
it is heat related though....
