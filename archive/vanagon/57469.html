Subject: Re: Fuse Block Connectors

&gt;I'm looking for a source for the round socket/pin type connectors used in 
&gt;Vanagon wiring harness's that connect to the fuse block. My VW dealer says 
&gt;these pins are only available in preterminated harness's and are not
available 
&gt;separately.
You dealer is full or crap. Now that a real news flash. :) Tell him to look
on the microfilm in the &quot;0&quot; section. It's full of the nifty little
connectors and crimping tools for making a harness look like it's from the
factory. HTH
