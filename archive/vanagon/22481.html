   [dcarment describes a noise like shaking bells on his aircooled vanagon]

I had a noise that I'd describe exactly the same way on my
aircooled vanagon.  I got a friend to drive the vanagon and
followed him closely (one lane over) on an empty freeway.  It
turned out to be a nut/bolt used to hold the left side of the
exhaust system in place.  It was loose enough to rattle freely
around in its hole, and had a fairly bell-like ring.

Doubt you'll have the same problem, but the technique might
help.  I probably would have eventually found the loose bolt by
hand, but it would have taken a lot longer.

Dennis
