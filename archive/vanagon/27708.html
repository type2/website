Subject: Roadside Attractions

Since I own 5  different kinds of vehicals, I have found all sorts of
internet lists to fill my mailbox every day. Through a BMW motorcycle list
found out about a new list that may be of interest to the Vanagon folks:
Roadside Attractions ! You know, those old homemade museums, giant concrete
whales in the middle of nowhere, tacky stuff like that. I just signed on,
and have rcvd about 10 messages well worth reading, IMHO
