I just remembered something else about the bus floors; since it's pretty
unlikely that VW is going to have 2 or more different floorpans for its 
various trim levels, it should be possible for someone w/ rear facing
theater seats to put in the middle forward facing bench and vice versa.
You just need to locate the appropriate holes under the carpeting.
