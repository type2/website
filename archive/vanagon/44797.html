&gt;   I guess I still have a ways to go before the big road trip in August . I'm
&gt; going to try a heavier wt. oil, right now I'm running the 10w40. I've checked
&gt; the relief valve , though when I took it out it seemed to of been in the
I was concerned about oil press. in my Jetta TD after installing a 
gauge in the cylinder head (where the low pressure sensor was). I 
found that 10w40 oil gave the lowest oil pressure when hot - about 5 
lbs less than 10w30, and 15lbs less than 20w50. I've used 20w50 ever 
since, and get 30-40 psi at the cylinder head when hot _at_3000 rpm. 
Idle pressure runs about 10-15 psi hot.
