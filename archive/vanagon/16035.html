Subject:       Syncro Air Filter

I have a question for Syncro owners regarding air filters, and I was 
wondering if anyone could clarify some points for me.

I have been using the big air filter (part # 25129620B) which goes 
for $136 CDN (just phoned for the latest price).  My dealer, who used 
to stock these no longer do so.  They have to be ordered from 
Toronto.

The kicker is this, after 5 years they told me that the regular 
Vanagon air filter also fits.  Apparantly it is a round cylinder 
versus the oval jobbie I have in there now.  The price is $20.38 CDN.  
They said that the Syncro filter is used only for extremely dusty 
conditions.  

I have only put in 2 filters in 5 years... 2 year service life.  Even 
after 2 years the filter is very clean.... I don't do much dirt road, 
and maybe because the air intake is so high in the rear it doesn't 
get much dust (?).  

What filters do you use?  Would you have the part # available?  Is it 
a MAAN filter?  

Any help would be appreciated.  I could have bought over 11 filters 
for the price of the 2 I put in :(

TIA

Harry.
