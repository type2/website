Subject: cold weather is a drag...


I know most everybody is gone for the holidays, so I am risking having
no replies, but here goes: (Joel, I know you're still lurking around!)

How come, first thing in the morning (temp. about 30 degrees F), my Bus
doesn't want to roll?  It's almost like the brakes are dragging.  After
it's been on the road for awhile, this symptom goes away.  Could it be
the transmission?  I've noticed that it's making more noise than it used
to, and if I grab the shift knob and put a little pressure on it, the
noise gets much worse.  I'm hoping it's something minor like it needs
fluid or something.  Does the xmsn fluid ever degrade and get gummy
when cold?
