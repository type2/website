Subject:      my &quot;new&quot; syncro's tires

hello,

I've been lurking around the list for a while, without a van of my own.
But I'm here today as the PROUD new owner of an '87 Syncro.  I was
persistent in my search and was rewarded with what I feel was a fair
deal on a 10 year old vehicle in quite good condition.  I suppose now
I'll have to loose my '96 Jetta, which I like, and the monthly payment,
which I don't like!  Anyway, that being said, I was curious about the
tires on my &quot;new&quot; car - All of the tires are the same size, but is it OK
that three (fronts and 1 rear) of the tires are of different
tread pattern and are slightly older (PO must have had a flat), thus
showing more wear.  The remaining three are still in good shape but
I was curious if I should scrap them and purchase new ones?

Thank you,

Dave Dempsey, demps2_at_erols_dot_com
