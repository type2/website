482B and 211 255 481B.  The prongs that hold them in are angled differently
and are not interchangeable.  They are also curved very slighly the long
way.

Right on.  #211-255-482-B goes on the passenger side, and #211-255-481-B on
the driver's side.  I hadn't pulled the driver's because it was too early in
the morning to do "bus yoga" to get to the driver's side vent insert. :O)

Both of mine seem to be in good shape overall.  They'll need a little clean
up, but it shouldn't be a job like the long mirror stem has been.
