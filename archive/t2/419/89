Subject: front beam replacement

Need a little direction on replacing the front beam on my 1968 Westy. During
the winter while restoring my 68 "Grateful Grape" I tore the steering pivot
off the front axle necessitating a replacement. Since I have to go through the
cost and labor,all my own,  I wanted to kill a few birds with one stone. I
want to lower the front end anywhere from 1 1/2" to 21/2 " and have purchased
a Bus Boys Albatross beam.I have a 1974 parts bus with disk brakes and wanted
to change from the 68 drums to 74 disk's. I understand that due to the
different wheel pattern I will also have to swap the rear suspension to make
everything uniform. I plan on purchasing new wheels to make the whole thing
come together.If anyone has good or bad experience with this or if any major
modification is necessary please let me know. I am assuming this is a bolt
in/out swap.
