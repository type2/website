Subject: CHT Gauge wiring.... HELP!

Hey guys,

	I got my CHT gauge and sending unit. I installed both.... however, I
do not have enough line for them to meet! I routed the CHT wiring from the
left side of the bus all the way to the right side, and followed the
original wiring harness as it makes it's way down that long stretch of pipe
down the under-passenger side of the Bus. THEN, as it makes it's way around
to the front, I ran out of wire JUST as it enters the cabin. I'm about 3-4
feet short of wire. Does anyone know where I can get the wire I need for the
CHT gauge? From what I understand, I have to use special wire.. or is that
just on the sender? Can I just use any old wire?


Thanks,
