Subject: valve spring nearly touching rocker

I have had a valve that had been needing adjustment more 
frequently. The valve spring is nearly touching the rocker. I figured 
the seat of the valve is burnt and the valve is sliding back. I did a 
compression test and it came out to be about 80 pounds.  I planed 
on getting the head replaced.  

Some people on the list were talking about using diesel to clean 
out carbon.  I thought i'd give it a try so I bought  1liter of diesel and 
 poured some into the carburettors  while the van was running then 
poured the remainder in my gas tank during the next fill up. I drove 
about 600miles then reset the valves and checked the 
compression.  The bad cylinder was back up over 100 pounds.

The van runs great but i'm a bit concerned with rocker almost 
touching the spring.  The rest of the valve springs seem to be 
random distances from the rocker.  How can I fix the spring that is 
nearly touching?

Thanks for and help.
