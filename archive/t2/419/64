Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Gauge wiring.... HELP!

Hi Todd,

I installed the VDO CHT gauge kit in my bus just before EveryBus this 
spring.

The supplied wire will only reach the dashboard if you follow the most 
direct route possible from the sender to the dash. In my case I used 
cable ties to attach the wire to the frame and I drilled a small hole 
just to the left of the heat riser pipe to feed the wire into the 
passenger compartment. I put the gauge in the clock pod and it only 
just fit.

 From what I've read on the list I'm led to understand that lengthening 
the wiring will make the gauge less accurate. I'd recommend you reroute 
the wire.

Happy trails,
