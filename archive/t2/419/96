aha! I managed to determine which burned wires were what
colour, and found the voltage regulator in the cabinets.
I made a replacement harness and have installed, but forgot
to add the pig-tale wire to the blue wire in right
chassis-harness so will do today..

will see if the fremont one has one...not sure if they will
be of much use...last time they wouldn't let you check them
out...in closed stacks!  ;-(

I understand teh long wire from teh inj harness goes to the
#1 terminal on coil, and the green from dist goes on the 15
terminal, but there are other wires that appear from the
left side, than appear to go to coil, but not sure which
goes to what terminal, both black...one thick, one
thin.....and any others that go to coil?

There is a black wire from right side that appears to
probably go to teh black wire from teh alternator? this is
ffrom the westy harness, right?

than there is the whole vacuum-line fiasco...the '80 had a
sticker in the bay that showed what went where...but this
one...  ;-(

more questions later...
