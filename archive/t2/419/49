Subject: Late bay tranny in early bay?

Will a late bay tranny, with mounts on top of the bellhousing, fit a 
'68-'71 bus?  Will the upright engine bolt up, and will the starter 
engage properly?  Do the mounts on the top of the bellhousing hit the 
bodywork of the earlier bus?  Is the front mount, shift rod, etc a 
match?

I'm asking because I have a whine in the rear end of my '70 Westy, and 
I have a chance to get a later model rebuilt tranny.

THANKS!
