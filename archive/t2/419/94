Subject: Painting a Bus

question :::::::
for all those that paint how do you paint a bus Tye Dye....
i had a friend that had a beetle in high school and his cousin painted it purple and white tye dye...
i have lost touch with this friend
he is now in the marine corps and fighting in iraq and i didnt think he would care at the momment to respond to me on how to paint something tye dye LOL...
anyways it looked really good and looked exactly like a shirt would if tye dyed...
i have painted before and the only thing i could come up with in thought was a fanning method but then again ...?.........

i dont know it cant be splattered but it cant be fanned looking either has to be tye dye...
whats the thoughts on this..
i know it can be done....cause i have seen it before...
everyone i ask looks at me like i am crazy ...
i mean all these bus driving tye dye wearing peoples and surely someone else besides me has thought of this..

i have re done the inside in pergo and birch so she is really pretty with the old wooden look inside like a boat..
i just thought a nice tye dye respectably would look good for the outside..
its going to be awhile maybe next summer before i get to paint her ?
anyways::::: looking for ideas on this ...............
how can it be possible to tye dye a bus....
the only thing reasonable to start with i can think of is to start out with a total white bus (canvas)?

whats your thoughts..
peace
