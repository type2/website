Subject: Quick Oil Filter Question

I just put a new oil filter (STP) on my 2L t4 engine,
I always put it on hand tight
Fired up the engine and its leaking real bad
1 to 2 drips per second.

I removed the filter, checked the gasket to see if it was out of place, 
pinched or otherwise in the wrong place.

No problems.

Put it back in tightened it with a wrench, just a half turn beyond hand tight.

Still leaks.

I've never used the STP filter on the engine.  The rubber seal seams a bit 
on the hard side.

Any thoughts?

Thanks
Scott
