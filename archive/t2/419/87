Subject: RE: AC Delco Alternator

You know, you're probably going to get a lot of hard-lined old school people
telling you NOT to use the AC Delco alternators, and to go with original
equipment. However, I have to really concur with your idea. The thing is,
the AC Delco alternators are MUCH smaller now, just as reliable, and DO
produce more juice. They are also EASY to get, easy to replace, and may even
produce less and retain less heat than the stock VW alternators. 

For a Bus that is no longer original, doesn't have the original motor,
etc... this might REALLY be a good swap.

Plus, it also has the voltage regulator built in.. much less wiring hassle!

"Has anyone ever installed one of these superior Delco alternators on to a
