Might have been good that you didnt block them off if you have the need for
heat where you are. The booster fan on my bus doesn't put out alot of
volume. It seems that most of my hot air comes from the cooling fan while at
higher RPM's. While driving around town I pretty much freeze. Gotta get that
BA-6 running this fall!
