Bruce, the 70A boot that I was sent wasn't round on both ends, or round at
all along it's length.  It might have been made to fit a round connection at
either end, but it wasn't round itself that I can remember.  I only took a
few minutes to look over the one that I examined.

I sent it back about 5 minutes after opening the box at the USPS because I
wasn't sure that I could repro it at the time.  I've got more experience and
a larger selection of materials now, but can't find a 70A boot to work with.

I'd love to take a shot at it, if nothing else, just to see how well the
resin holds up to the wear and tear of actual use as an engine part.
