Subject: I need a front beam- please help!!!

I'm still looking for a front beam for my 76 Westy right away. Bus-Boys has
one, but shipping to the east coast puts it here in 7-10 days.
I'm looking for a good one relatively close to me. I'll drive 4-5 hours. I'm
in Erie, PA.
Anyone in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo have one?

Please help, my wife booked us at a campground on the 26th and it's $62
non-refundable- I don't want to eat it because my bus isn't ready.

Thanks,

Nik
