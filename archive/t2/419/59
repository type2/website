I had the same problem this weekend. Check the gap on your points if you got
'em...should be .016" according to the Muir book. Replace the condenser if
you have one. Also, try bypassing the ignition switch, you can get one of
those little remote starters from Autozone that clamp to the starter
terminals on the starter. Just turn the key on then go back to the remote
starter and try it. If it starts, then the problem is in your ignition
switch or the wiring to the starter from it.
 The Muir book also has a great chapter on troubleshooting your problem step
by step. good luck!

Did you check the points, could have closed on you.
Power is to the coil so, it could be bad points,
condenser, cap or rotor. Phil
