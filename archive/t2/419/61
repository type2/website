Subject: fan shroud flaps

I was under the impression that those flaps were there so that the heater 
blower would work at idle.  When the engine is idling, there is only a 
trickle of air from the cooling fan to send heat to the front of the 
bus.  When you turn the heater on, the air pressure from the heater fan 
closes the flaps.  Once the engine is up to highway speed, the pressure 
from the cooling fan is higher than that of the heater fan and it pushes 
the flaps open again.  I think the flaps are necessary so that when you are 
idling with the heater on, it keeps the heater fan from blowing air that 
has been in the heat exchanger back into the cooling fan.  Of course I 
could be wrong. gt
