Subject: Re: [T2] child's cot 

> I know that 78 child's cots were collapsible some how but I figured all of the
 cots would be the same size.  So how many different size child's cots were
 there for bay window buses?  And where am I gonna find the right size?
 
What part does not fit?
All the bay cot canvas is the same size.  But they do shrink.....
The bars are different lengths:
68-73 are 56 1/4" long.
74-75 are 57 1/4" long.
76-79 are two piece collapsible, but the 74-75 will fit.... you just won't have a place to store them.
The half moons are mounted higher up on the A and B pillars on 68-73 buses.
