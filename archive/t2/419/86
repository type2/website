guess so, too.

Not very likely, but it could be one of the flaps inside the carbs (but only
if you're running a dual-carb setup. I don't think it can travel through the
air intake of a dual/single-port upright engine.).

> So, any suggestions before I drop the motor and pull the head?

Just to be sure: Try to turn the engine by hand. If it's pretty hard to do
or simply impossible, the valve most likely
gets hit by the piston. Drop the motor, pull the head.
If you can turn the engine by hand... drop it and pull the head anyway.

Check the pistons (minor dents in the middle aren't that bad), remove
valve-spring and check the seat (It could have been forced back in place by
the valve).
Pull the other head, too. Check both! Head-failures tend to come in pairs.

> I haven't had to pull either of my motors (bus or 914) in over 5 years.

you're very, very lucky...
