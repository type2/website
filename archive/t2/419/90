I frequently check the price of the Pertronix and the best deal is 59.95 at
RMMW. I've seen a few similar prices in the VW mags but there's always a
catch like an invoice fee or something just as unpleasant.

I can find many examples where BD has the lowest price and equally as many
where it does not. Please, let's end the debate.
