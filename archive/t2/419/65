Subject: Oil Cooler mounting backet

Hi all,

Finally have started reassembling the engine. Have a question regarding the
bracket that is attached to the oil cooler. Mine is broken in half. Was
wondering how important this bracket is? It was broken when I took it off
and while I had some leaks in other areas of the engine, the oil cooler
wasn't leaking at all. Is this something I should really replace? If so,
anyone have an old one laying around?
