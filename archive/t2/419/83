your "comparison" is only valid if you are in fact comparing the SAME parts.
If both suppliers are supplying the same item that's one thing, but it is
also very possible that they are not supplying the same item (though the
"description" is the same), so that's an apples and oranges comparison.

If you want cheap, buy from JC Whitney and tell us all how much you saved,
LOL.
