Subject: Re: [T2] fan shroud flaps

Hello,

The flaps close shut against the fan shroud. When I
put the fan shroud back on my engine, these flaps were
severely mishapened. When you slide them back on, just
use your hand and press them flat against the fan
shroud to make sure they will close properly and make
sure they can swing freely. If you don't have the
blower fan, these ports are the only thing pushing air
through the heat exchangers. I thought about blocking
these flaps off and just let the blower fan push the
air for the heat exchangers. That way more cooling air
would be available to cool the engine but I am sure
those German engeneers knew what they were doing when
they designed it.

Any way, Take care!
