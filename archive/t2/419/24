Subject: Re: [T2] head rests on bench seat

Yes, 73 and up came with headrest capability on the middle and rear seats.
73 headrests are one-year-only: they have release buttons. 74 and up are friction fit.
73-75 are soft vinyl. But age is getting to them. The cloth material between the zipper and vinyl on the
bottom is falling apart.
76-79 are hard plastic. The sun bothers them along the edges. They get brittle and crack when you press on
them.
Some colors are very hard to find, i.e. black in either variety. I have lots of headrests.... even that
horrible orange used in 74/75 Westies.


> I noticed in my bus that their are plastic caps where it looks like head
 rests could go in on the bench seat, is that what they are there for?
