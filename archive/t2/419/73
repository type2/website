Subject: Westy problems

Hello guys

I am having some problems with my 76 1600 DP westy, two weeks ago I found a
small hole in the J tube that comes from the cylinder # 3, that could explain
some backfires over run dowhill, the problem is getting worst since two days
ago, there is a louder sound like a exaust leak, the strange is that the sound
get lower as an engine comes hotter, I have not experience any major lost of
power but is more dificult to start when the engine is cold. I am worried
about the valves or a damage in the engine since this mean more work and
money.
Any inputs will be appreciate.

Thanks in advance, one more time

Roberto
