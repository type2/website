Bob,

So do these flaps have some sort of spring to hold them closed. From the
diagrams that I have seen they seem to just ride on a pin that fits through
the shroud. http://www.bus-boys.com/aircoolsystem.html  I cant see how they
will stop the air flow if they just swing loose.

Its not that they would be hard to put in but just getting the rest of the
exhaust system to line back up and bolted back together after having
everything out is the hard part. You know how well those after market parts
just slip right in like the original ; )
