Subject: Bus for sale in So Cal

A friend here in San Pedro is selling his bus. Here's the info:

1979 Bus (non-camper) for $1,000 obo.

THE GOOD NEWS: Nice cream over teal repaint on a great body. Engine rebuilt 
two years ago, passed smog then but currently registered as non-op. Tranny'
s good. The entire brake system is brand new. Captain's chairs in the front.

THE BAD NEWS: The reason he's selling it is because the steering column broke,
  he can walk to work these days, and he's so non-mechanically-inclined that 
getting it towed to a shop for repairs is an overwhelming mental exercise.
  His wife is getting tired of seeing it sitting in the driveway.

P-mail me if you're interested.
