I was able to get these flaps in without removing the heater box.
I first removed the fan. Not the housing! Just the fan. I also took off 
the little covers over where the heater box meets the housing.
I was then able to get both of them in. You can see the one on the left 
by looking at through where the fan was. It also make retrieval of the 
pin when you drop it easy.
All three time in rolled into the fan housing. I had a whistle when I 
reved my motor up that went away when I put these flaps in. Why I don't 
know??
