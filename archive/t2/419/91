Better grow out your mullet/chops and fire up the 'ol Camaro if you're gonna go down this road.

I'm not in the 

"hard-lined old school people"

camp, but I have been listening closely to list advice for 4 years and I can tell you that Bosch parts like other Bosch parts.

Not to mention cooling arrangements? mounting? wiring? Delco alternators have different working principles/testing methods than the stock Bosch. 

When you tire of your befungled bus project and pass it on, who's gonna be stuck figuring out your engineering defeat?

This is just a bigger=better bad American idea.

Customize your exhaust or interior? Sure. Principal players in the electrical primary? Bosch.

I don't think the person who recommended this as a "good idea" has a shred of investigation/study/practical knowledge invested in the advice you're getting.
