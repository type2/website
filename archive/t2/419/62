I have wondered about this often myself.  These things almost always
are cracked from sun exposure over the years.  While there has been
a huge demand for padded dashes on the beetles and ghias, nobody
seems to carry the padded skins that were glued to the steel dashes
of the bay windows...

  It's kinda depressing that our beloved bays are still kinda
neglected this way when there are several outfits that are making
panels and such.  Personally speaking I can make my own panels and
upholster them.  I can't just whip up a dash mold and make that
though.  Just don't have the equipment to do it.  If anybody happens
to come across a solution other than a vinyl paste to fill the
cracks, please let me know.  I myself have been seriously
considering what a vinyl free, clean steel, painted dash would look
like on a late bay....  would look clean, that's for certain.
Although if I were to do that I would need to weld some of the
punchouts shut that are typically hidden by the vinyl exterior.  I
seriously doubt anybody from my states DMV would care if my non
airbag, 27 year old bus had a padded dash or not.  Especially when
you consider that that minimal bit of padding is so old and hard by
now that it would do as much damage to my face in a wreck that the
bare steel would.

Who knows?  since the splitties are getting more and more pricey,
more and more folks are looking at the bay windows.  Demand might go
up for dash parts.  Maybe somebody will start making the plastic
inserts for the dash defroster vents again as well.

Wishful thinking,
