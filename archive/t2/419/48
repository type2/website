Subject: Leaking Oil Cooler on type 4 engine

On a type 4 engine is there any way to replace the seals on the stock oil
cooler with out dropping the engine?  The engine was just put in today and
when the engine was turning over there was a large leak in the oil cooler
area.  Is it possible to get to it without dropping the engine or can you
remove the fan housing with the engine in place and access the cooler from
there.......It got to dark out to do it tonight and its been a long day
anyways.........this is a 1.8L fuel infected engine in a 75 bus.


THanks in advance....
