Subject: Mini splittie & picture of Giacomo

Had a nice surprise at church tonight.  A family came back form a short
vacation to Myrtle Beach, SC and while there they found an interesting
souvenir at the Gay Dolphin Gift Cove (Ocean blvd. & Boardwalk at 10th).
(They have a champagne bay.)

They picked up a couple of Die-cast splitties made by Welly.  They're
approximately 1:48 scale, with operating double side doors (don't remember
what they're called, the ones that replace the sliding door).  The text on
the underside labels them as a 1962 Microbus (Welly Product #9764).

They got one to match their own bus, and picked up a white on red one for
us.  Really nice of them to think of us like that.

There are full width bench seats, front, middle and rear; with a suitcase
between the middle and rear seat and a briefcase centered on the rear seat
(all molded in, except the middle seat which seems to be glued to a slightly
raised platform the same size as the seat bottom.  A splittie owner would
have to look at the dash to see how authentic it is.

And...

Our club took some pics of our latest outing, and Giacomo got his picture
taken!  I've placed one of them here:
