Subject: child's cot 

So there is a local wrecking yard and I saw a child's cot in a bus there a
while ago.  Now that I own a westy to keep my 60 company I figured I'd go and
get that cot - did that today.

The cot is in very nice shape.  There is a small hole near one edge.  I
suspect I bic pen would pass through it.  There is also a small hole - big
enough for my thumb I suppose - in the part where the poles pass through.
Very easy repairs - but .... it doesn't fit my bus.

I know that 78 child's cots were collapsible some how but I figured all of the
cots would be the same size.  So how many different size child's cots were
there for bay window buses?  And where am I gonna find the right size?

jdd 60 std, 78 westy
