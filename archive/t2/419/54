Subject: Ball joint boots

Some of the dust boots on the balljoints on my 1971 westy are torn and
exposoing the ball joints.  The ball joints are in good shape and I hate to
have to replace or even rmeove them.  Is the a retrofit boot available,
preferably one that can be installed without having to remove the ball
joint?
