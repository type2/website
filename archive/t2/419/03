Subject: How Hot does it get in Phoenix, AridZona?

This was shown on Channel 12 in Phoenix the other day.

A cookie sheet was placed on the dash of a car in the Phoenix "Sun" and
cookie dough was placed on the sheet--YES - The cookies were baked inside
the car on the cookie sheet.

This IS NOT a Hoax--

Moral: Enjoy were you are living--It has GOT to be better then Phoenix in
the "Simmer"
