As of today, my '77 sunroof is still lowered via the adjustable beam and I am
having way too much fun driving it.

But, I have researched the whole deal and I will be installing air- ride on this
bus this winter:

There is a beam made by Nate Curtis on the west coast that is built especially
for bays with bags. Its pricey, but the proper way to do it. I will build the
rear mounts myself and hopefully have it ready for the spring...

But, to answer the guys question, the bus-boys adjustable beam is still the
"best" way to lower a bay and then just turn the rears a notch.

Drop spindles for bays are available, but I think they need more testing a
refinement. My $.02.
