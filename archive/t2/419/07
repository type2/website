Just for kicks. Double check the spark wires. to make sure they are
still attached in the correct order. #4 should be next to the correct
#1 wire & #2 should be on the other side of the #1 wire when
confirmed.

I doubt it would block the airflow enough to do any restriction of
merrit, however if it is not sealed correctly you will have a huge
vacuum leak which will cause the engine to run HOT. If worried about
this do check it.

don't get too frustrated. if some more simple things like making sure
wires etc are in order doen't work, I'd recommend an engine pull. that
way you can confirm a lot of stuff.

well, if it overheaded & dropped a valve or worse cracked a head, you
won't ever get it fixed w/out doing major work. but easily done if you
have the patience.

if worried about the intake do check it, you don't want a vacuum leak
that big running that head so lean it cooks it.
