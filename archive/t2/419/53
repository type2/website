So after a wonderful day of Kayaking I loaded all four boats into my 73 
bus, got everyone seated, turned the key and .......

hmmm, the starter is whirring, maybe a little gas, starter still 
whirring, she just wont fire up !

So I tried a few more times, tried a push start, checked the battery, I 
have full power to my lights, and accessories, but the plugs aren't 
firing !
I replaced the plugs, the cables, the battery and the plug boots over 
the last month or so and she has been running like a dream.
She drove out to the mountains, parked. Started again to drive around, 
started again after coffee, started when I had to move her 10ft, but 
when I returned from my kayaking she wont start !

Any thoughts ? My Electric fuel pump is getting current from the coil, 
I cant hear it ticking away, but my plugs just aren't firing ! The 
distributor looks like its in good shape, but then I guess I don't 
really know about that.

I turn the key and she pumps fuel (all new fuel lines/filter), the 
starter turns happily but no firing ...

I've got the bus in my driveway, after having it driven over on a 
flatbed, the 150km from the mountains, so I have time to tinker !

Sorry for the rambling tale, but I wanted to include all the info.

Its a 1973 1700cc dual pict34s and she doesnt want to go ...
