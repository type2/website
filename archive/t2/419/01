Subject: 1-2 cyl. not firing?? whats the likely culprit.

motors running after minor adjustments, parts, etc.
It appeared when i first got it running (before i
dropped the motor) that it was firing all cyl.
I rebuilt the carb and go to test drive, to get it hot
so I can adjust carb., wow this thing had no power at
all, poping down the road.

I took #3-4 cyl wires one at a time while running and
the motor dropped idle.
when i did #1-2 cyl. nothing, it still ran the same..

I rechecked vavle clearance, (fine)
someone told me maybe my O ring washer on the intake
is smashed and maybe blocking it somewhat, is this
possible?

I just want my bus to run like a VW should and Im
getting more frustrated!!!
of course I cant complain, i practically stole the
thing.

b.t.w. this is the bus that sat for 7-8 yrs, and PO
said it had over heated, etc, etc. 
What is the likely culprit??
should i again drop the motor and check for the intake
senario, is this a far fetched..??

the bus is all stock..
thanx,
