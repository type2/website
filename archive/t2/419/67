Well, I'm flummoxed.

The 70A boot that was sent to me (and that the USPS managed to lose on it's
return) doesn't look as if it would fit into this application, unless I'm
misunderstanding the scale of the custom boot.

David, could you post the general dimensions of your custom boot?  Maybe
length, width and rough diameter?  Thanks.
