You have to remove the heater boxes to replace those flaps.

 system.  they cannot remain open as you will loose too much cooling air, (path of least resistance)

Please explain how air flow goes backwards if you do not have a gas heater or some other means to move air
upstream??? They are aluminum and weigh less than a match book cover. As soon as the engine starts, the air
flow from the fan blows them open.
