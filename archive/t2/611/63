Agreed. In fact, that's one of the thoughts I'm working over. I even
have a pretty decent idea on the design too. (I built seats for
go-carts in high school.)

Even if we DO take 6 camping, the teenagers will want their own tent
anyway. Since I've got a collection of tents, not a problem. The bus
would be for me, my wife, and our 1 year old. That's assuming we bring
the teens other than my 13 year old. ;-)

Seating 6 is also desired for trips to Magic Mountain, Knotts,
Dismalland, etc. Volvo fits 5 VERY tightly. Fiero? 2. heh
