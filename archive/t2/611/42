Mike,

My opinion same as other folks, but with an added point...these things 
cost *big* bucks...I buy a lot of car parts at Lowe's....in the plastic 
pipe department<grin>.

The other part is actually attaching them to the carbs....your are sure 
going to get a "lot" of vibration 2 feet away to something attached to the 
edge of the engine....Kadrons take a 2 5/8" neck size.

Use the stock air cleaners and spend your money on something else.

Cheers, dave
