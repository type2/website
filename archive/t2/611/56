If you've got kids, the walk-through is worth its weight in gold. The
old "if you kids don't stop it, I'm stopping and coming back there"
takes on a meaning in a walk-though bus that it doesn't have for any
other vehicle.

But as for the possiblity -- of course it's possible. If you want to
install a Volvo marine engine and four wheel drive, that's possible
too. You could even make a bus look like a Hummer if you wanted to.
