Headlight help!  Sounds simple, but I'm running into trouble getting the
headlights and headlight rims back onto my 72 bus.  This is my first bus
restoration and I did not take the headlights off myself.  I'm having
trouble understanding where to put the spring that is on the back of the
headlight rim...where does it attach (which hole in the rim).  Also, how
do you get the rims on?  I had everything in place, I thought, until I
tried to attach the chrome rim, and it would NOT go on.  I assume the
headlights have to be exactly straight for the rim to go on?
Any advice on this simple, yet very aggravating, task?
THANKS!
