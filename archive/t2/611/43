Subject: RE: [T2] Re: cool air intake

I read an article the other day on the aftermarket cone filter cool air intakes and they actually (some of them) reduce your power output because they are gulping hot air rather than cool air like the OEM air box. 

These cool air intakes will increase your top speed and acceleration numbers b/c your wallet will be a bit lighter. <grin!>

The cool air intakes often require a shield that separates the aftermarket intake from the engine and once you add all the baffles and shields, your car once again sports an airbox - albeit a homemade one... 

In VW's I never have hot air problems but rather icing problems on carb engines.
