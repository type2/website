heres' how I have done it.
. losen the tin that covers the cyl tops.  (take out the screws)
. get a 6inch or so extender and put a socket on that.
. work it under the tin and leave it there
. slide it sideways to get to the appropriate head bolts and use the
torque wrench as needed
. obviously you will need another socket for the head bolts under the
rockers.

when done carefully get that socket and extender out from under the tin
and re secure the tin

it is a real tight fit and you don't want to constantly stick the socket
back and forth under the tin so leave it until your done, trust me on this
one.

it is a PITA but it will work, I've changed heads without removing the
engine or tin but it is pretty hard.

be sure and restraighten any tin that gets bent in the process.
