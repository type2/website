Can be.  While partition and walkthrough are different body styles,
both came with the respective other seat arrangement optionally.
Walkthrough with a bench seat (no walkthrough as such, but a walkthrough
body), and partition with a single passenger seat.  The latter even
does make sense (somewhat): it allows you to have the spare wheel in
the cab and retain the single passenger seat, and in panel vans a
partition may make sense regardless of number of seats anyway.

I don't know if pick-ups got that option too, but I assume they did.

I've even seen one "partition walkthough" panel, a '73 fire engine, 
but sadly didn't photograph it.  The "walkthrough bench" version I 
have never laid my eyes on yet.  Doesn't make a lot of sense, though, 
which is why I expect they're awfully rare.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
