I have done it both ways and though I like manuvering the smaller mass of the engine alone I prefer not having to "stab" the engine onto the tranny shaft when I remove bath as a unit. 

Now with my Corvair conversion I have no choice b/c the Corvair tranny has a fragile cast iron snout that the throw-out bearing rides on which is fragile and requires a complete tranny teardown to repair. 

I only recommend pulling the engine and tranny if you have a helper to help balance the load package or an ATV jack.
