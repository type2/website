If you don't care about the bearings, and I usually don't when splitting a
case, the best thing is a soft faced hammer or a 4 lb sledge. The secret
though is NOT to hit the case. Hit the connecting rod straight in toward
the crank. Alternate between all 4 rods. The rods can take that kind of
impact, they get it every few milliseconds while running. The impact forces
are distributed evenly along the crank and the center of the case. No
tweaking or bending or chipping of the soft aluminum alloy case. Heavier
hammer and a lighter swing are better than wailing away on it with a light
hammer. Support the rod with your free hand, don't ever let it sit on the
side of the bore or that will chip and it will be leak city.

Good luck. And, do another search for fasteners again, just for me. Both
sides of the case, all around the seam. Sometimes I swear that they move
around as I remove them and one always dodges the "wrench of fate".
