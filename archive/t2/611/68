Hi Mike,

It's not *That* hard to get the upper tranny hanger bolts undone, but 
it does take me an extra 10 minutes. It helps to have a variety of 15mm 
socket wrenches to play with, and you need to be able to work with your 
arms over your head for a while. There are no nuts on these bolts, they 
are threaded into the frame.

Putting it back up you are going to want to install the tranny first. 
Raising the tranny and engine together is a LOT of weight and unless 
you have an ATV jack it would be dangerously tippy. Bolt the tranny 
nose into place and then put the CV's in... but keep the tranny about 
4" below the brackets until you get the engine bolted to it. Then raise 
the engine into place and the tranny should line up EXACTLY with the 
hanger bolts. At least it's always worked that way for me.

That's what works for me; YMMV.

Happy trails,
