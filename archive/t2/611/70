I have had problems that I put down to sucking in hot air with the infamous 
weber progressive. There is a noticeable loss in power when the engine is 
fully warmed up. Stopping for 15-30 min. temporarily restores the power.

I am in the middle of modifying an air cleaner to fit the progressive 
mainly to overcome cold running problems. However, I have also attached a 
length of flexible heater type hose to the air cleaner's cold air intake 
and run it over the battery. Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to test 
it b/c I discovered that #3 cylinder isn't pulling its weight! Removing the 
spark plug lead makes no difference to the running. :((

Cheers,
