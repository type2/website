Subject: Re: [T2] Convert walkthrough to a bench seat?

Hi Don,

It's possible. There were baywindow buses built as non-walk-though 
models, particularly the single-cab and double-cab models.

I have a bus bench seat I am planning to install in my wife's 77 
Sunroof Automatic bus. I am going to have to weld in some supports to 
hold it up, but that shouldn't be too hard to figure out. When I get 
around to it I will be sure to post some pics.


Happy trails,
