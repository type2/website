If you look at the shape of those intakes, they are in a position where the filter is down low and out of the way of the radiator with an opening to the side. I don't know why they are called cold air intakes because the OEM units are often in the exact same spot. Cool air intakes would be a more appropritate name: the aftermarket versions have a tuned tube and it makes a "cool" sound.
