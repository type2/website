Subject: Need Work done on bus - in Ptld.

Calling all cars...calling all cars:

Hi Friends -

I'm just wondering if anyone has suggestions about where else I might post 
notes - besides here and thesamba - about trying to find help for my bus.

I live in Portland, Oregon and I'd like to invest in having some work done 
on my bus ('70 Riviera camper) but am hoping to find someone who can come 
work on it at my place and isn't a big-time professional in a shop.  
Obviously, it's all about money (or lack-of) - though I have enough to get a 
good chunk started on.  I just don't know where to turn.  I've met some 
great people through type2 who would be willing to do this work but go 
figure, they live on the other side of the country!

Many Thanks -
Marya
