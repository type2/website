No kidding!  In order to get to the head bolts, the cylinder tin must come
off.  For the cylinder tin to come off the fan shroud and mainfold must
come off.  For the fan shroud to come off, the generator must come off.
For the mainfold to come off the generator and air cleaner must come off.

In short, the engine has to come out to make all this happen easily.
