It would make more sense to construct a removable third seat for the 
walkthrough (Plywood+foam+steel reinforcement+vinyl) This would not be 
too hard to do, and the arrangement could also provide anchors for the 
extra set of seat belts you will need. Some kind of heavy but quick 
release bolts would be ideal, passing the bolts through the seat belt 
anchors.

You aren't planning on camping with six, are you? If that's the plan, 
it would make more sense to dispense with the kitchen cabinet and cook 
like a tent camper.
