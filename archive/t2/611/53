Subject: RE: [T2] Which Distributor?

Your right. I was looking at the wrong one on the chart. So I have the
correct dizzy for the bus. Is this the best in everyone's opinions for this
engine? Or is there another new and better performing dizzy to get. I have
since picked up on everyone's distaste for the 009. Wish the parts stores
new this, or were honest when it's for a bus.

cheers,
Dave

You are looking at 021 905 205S.

022 905 205S has the same curve as the 021 905 205P.
