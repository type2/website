Subject: Setting shifter to drop tranny & balance point?

We are pulling a 75 trans with the engine/trans together-
 I assume I must shift to 1st or
3rd and separate the shift cage, shift rod- then shift to 2nd and it
pulls apart?- how must I shift the donor trans to assure it also is in
2nd before putting back against the rod?
I read S. Bartnik's library offering- apparently it involves lossening
the nose end first and then the engine mounts- and it must move rearward
to clear the axle?  We have a wide "motorcycle" jack to lower it. Anyone
know the exact balance point of the engine/tranny combo?
