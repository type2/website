Subject: Re: [T2] Convert walkthrough to a bench seat?

Don,

While it is possible ( there was actually an optional "fill in" seat between 
the front seats of a walk through, hopefully on eof the guys who previously 
posted pictures of this might do so again ), personally, I'd carefully 
consider a move of this nature, the walk-through nature of the campers is 
GREAT when you're travelling, and just want or need to pull up and stop for 
the night, especially if it's cold/ wet/snowing or anything else unpleasant 
outside.

The walk-through makes life a lot easier, especially if anyone in the bus is 
less mobile.

The Oz Campmobiles are laid out a bit differently from the US & Euro ones, 
but this layout is very practical and handy, the stove and fridge ( 
refrigerator ) are in a cabinet just inside the side door, so that you can 
cook from inside or outside the bus, this leaves the walkthough clear and is 
quite viable for extended trips, my last partner and I used to go away in 
Tigger every weekend, and would take a 1-2 month extended trip once a year, 
and the layout was great for both short & long trips.

FWIW
