Don asked: What are these?

 They were given to me when I got the kitchen from a 77. He said they
were from that bus. But where did they go?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is the wall mounted cushion.
The green one laying upside down is from the 77 set-up.
The 2 standing up are from another bus, like a 74 or 75.
In the USA, 74/75 used a full width bench seat/bed.
76-79 used a 3/4 bench/bed. The green one is 76-79 for the pass side end.
The drivers side end butts to the cooler, so the cushion is not needed.
You can see the end of it here in page 12, right pic:
