Subject: Convert walkthrough to a bench seat?

Is it possible to install a bench in the front of my 73? It's
currently a walkthrough, but I'm going over places to install my "new"
77 Westy kitchen, and one possible place would be behind the passenger
seat and stretching across the aisle.

So: What's the possibility of installing a bench?
