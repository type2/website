Did this work on an Type I engine?  After about 1/2 hour of 
loosing/removing tin, it was apparant that I wasn't going to be able to 
loosen the tin enough to get to the head bolts.  The tin over the head was 
held in place by a piece of metal sticking out of the fan housing (this is 
the head with #1 & #2 cylinders) which prevented it from being lifted up.

I'm in the process of removing the engine, hopefully I'll get it out 
tonight after the children are in bed.
