Subject: Oil cooler heater.....

Mike I have contemplated this but never done it.
My idea was to fit an additional oil cooler below the cabin floor just where
the heater tube comes in and mount a fan behind it to push air through it
and into the cabin.
The fun bit is connecting it up, you will need to plumb oil to the front and
have some way to turn it on/off as needed. Probably best to make it separate
to the normal pump to avoid any lubrication issues. You may need to bypass
the stock cooler to prevent the oil running too cool on a winter day. There
are small light electric oil pumps available and you could also use it to
also go through an external cooler to keep the motor cool on a hot summer
day!
I think it would work well if done correctly.
Cheers,
Richard




Has any one ever done this???



Heat the inside of your bus by running an "AUX oil cooler" INSIDE the bus's
cabin and thus heat the inside of your bus while cooling the oil for your
engine.



If I do this it will be on a Type 4 2L motor



Thoughts..

Suggestions.
