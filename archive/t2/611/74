Subject: cot dam

my head is dammed up with cot, and getting a trip together. i want to put a
late bay cot in an early bay cab. i have the early bay poles and hooks but
the later set [3 sided arrangement] appears more buff. so, in going with
late cot in the 69 am i hissing up a rope, anyone know about fitting - the
cabs are different are not they?

another thing i'm doing is pulling the nut off the inside of the oil pick
up. i removed the strainer, and while letting the oil drip overnight i'm
wondering if nyloc/self-locking nut is okay in the engine tar pits. that
regular nut was the source of a persistant oil leak that i am done with. i
pulled out a self-locking nut out of the last cadaver engine [same spot]
and thought hey why not me?

 - steve, looking forward to san francisco and leaving this wednesday.
