Subject: No Power to Coil

I have a 68' Kombi with a Petronix points replacement installed.  I pulled 
the engine several months ago to replace one of the heads (burnt valve).

Now it's all back together (almost) and it will not start.  I am not 
getting any spark, and it looks like I am not getting any power to the 
coil.  Unfortunately, my friend disconnected most of the wires running to 
the coil/distributer, so I don't remember exactly how it looked before we 
pulled it.

Based on the instructions from the Petronix unit, and the Bently manual, I 
have things wired correctly.  The Petronix is wired to posts 1 and 15 on 
the coil.

The wire running from the ignition switch has what looks like a fuse 
holder.  I can't find the fuse, if there was one, that was in there.  With 
the key turned to the "on" position, there is no power to this wire.  All 
of the other electrics work - horn, turn signals, starter, etc.  Is there a 
wire directly from the battery or starter that should run to the coil that 
I might be missing?

TIA
