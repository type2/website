Subject: New transmission... still no fourth gear

So, with all the fun of thinking i found the problem with the old trans, 
throwing it all back together only to find out that wasn't the problem, 
and buying a rebuilt transmission and putting that in in a day, I was 
thinking it would be nice if a similar problem arose with this 
transmission as well, so that I may feel even more blessed by the gods 
of lots and lots of costly work to do. 

This transmission is an IRS 002, and it came without the nose cone 
/shifter goodies.  So I took the cone and things off of my old 
transmission and put it into the new one. 

At first it just didn't shift into fourth, then I adjusted the shifter 
plate, and it went in very nicely...  until today when I was driving 
home and it came out of fourth and would not go back in. 

This is different than my old transmisison, which would pop out of 
fourth even when held in.  The new one will probably stay in fourth if I 
could get it in gear in the first place.  At least it did for a day.

I also noticed a little bit of noise when I'm on the acccelerator.  It 
almost sounds like it's not quite in gear when it's in third or fourth.  
It also seems a lot more sluggish than my old transmission. 

So yeah... will the shift rod not allow my bus to have fourth gear?  Do 
I need to pull everything out and rebuild that end, also?
