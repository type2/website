Subject: cool air intake

Has any one ever done this???

 

At some point this week I will be installing a set of dual Kadrons.

and was thinking it would be a good idea  to use something like this:

and have the intake snake up above the battery tray's and sit just inside
the air scoops thus getting FRESH unheated air...

 

If I do this it will be on a Type 4 2L motor

 

Thoughts..

Suggestions.

 

Thanx
