Subject: Oil cooler heater.....

Has any one ever done this???

 

Heat the inside of your bus by running an "AUX oil cooler" INSIDE the bus's
cabin and thus heat the inside of your bus while cooling the oil for your
engine.

 

If I do this it will be on a Type 4 2L motor

 

Thoughts..

Suggestions.

 

Thanx
