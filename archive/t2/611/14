I am very interested in this as well. I saw on vbay two weeks ago a tool 
used to hand turn the tranny for testing purposes. I was tempted to buy it 
but I got some other stuff needed instead. The tool was made by VW and 
looked like egg profile. The bigger side had a hole in it with teeth to 
match the spline an the smaller end had a handle to crank with. It would be 
easy to make such a device, but how do you test the transmission out of the 
bus or in the bus when not driveable?

Thanks,
