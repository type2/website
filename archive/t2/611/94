Went to Sears and bought a socket with an allen head on the end (plan to go back for the torx head too) that fits my axle bolts. DUH! Should have bought one YEARS ago. $6 or so. Pick you source. 

MUCH easier than the old allen or Torx wrench I had been using for about 10 years... My knuckles are MUCH happier.
