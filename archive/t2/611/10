Subject: window regulator

can anyone help me in how I am supposed to remove the
%*^&!(-at-) window regulator from the drivers side window? 
The one in my 75 broke and I currently am driving
around with a 76 door inthe back seat with the panel
removed and the regulator unscrewed, but cant remove
it due to there being no room, there is a metal piece
in the way, (looks like part of a plate supporting the
small triangular window.  My floor mats that serve to
keep out the rain when its parked will greatly
appreciate the support, as will I

Thanks
