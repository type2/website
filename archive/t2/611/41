Subject: 1986 Vanagon Camper GL for sale - Montreal, Quebec

Hi folks,

We are selling our Vanagon Camper GL in Montreal, Quebec.  There is also a
matching German-made trailer, if you are interested.

This summer we drove to les Iles de la Madeleine and back, during which time
we had a terrific trouble-free trip.

The van works great, but next year we're considering taking holidays in Europe
and will not be needing a camper at that time.

The vehicle is in excellent condition, w/ color Savannah Beige Metallic, a
2.1L Wasserboxer engine re-built in 2000.  Impeccable seat upholstery, new
brakes, tires, new Catalytic convertor, O2 sensor, plugs, cap & rotor.

The van has the full camper options, including pop-top, fridge, sink, stove,
one (1) double bed upper berth, one (1) double bed lower berth, and we'll
include our CB Radio, AM/FM/CD player, Bentley book.

The price is $10,500USD / $14,000CAN, which is not including the trailer.

Please call or e-mail for any questions / comments.   I welcome anyone to come
take a test drive and try it for yourself.

Thanks,
Shawn

P.S. We're keeping the '73 Campmobile in case anyone's wondering.
