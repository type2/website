That's a very good point that most cars nowadays come from the factory
with cold air intakes. Even my 88 Toyota truck has a factory cold air
intake. My 71 Pontiac, however, sucked its air from the engine
compartment.

But I still argue that a bus really doesn't have problems with hot
intake air, and a cold air intake wouldn't be worth the money.

If you look at the shape of those intakes, they are in a position where
the filter is down low and out of the way of the radiator with an
opening to the side. I don't know why they are called cold air intakes
because the OEM units are often in the exact same spot. Cool air intakes
would be a more appropritate name: the aftermarket versions have a tuned
tube and it makes a "cool" sound.
