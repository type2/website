Subject: Oil cooler heater.....

I'm thinking the oil would be too cold to be useful by the time it got that 
far forward. You are right about lube issues too. I'm not sure on the math 
of hydraulics, but I think the further it goes, the lower the pressure gets. 
The idea might work out if the cooler were placed below the back seat.

the heater tube comes in and mount a fan behind it to push air through it
and into the cabin
