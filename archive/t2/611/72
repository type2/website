Volks,
I hope this finds all enjoying the final days of summer!

This is my second offering to the list to try to cajole you all to 
consider a trip to Northeast Iowa on the weekend of September 17-18 for 
a fall gathering at the Pulpit Rock Campground in Decorah.  If you've 
travelled across Iowa on the Interstates you be surprised at what you 
find when you come to Northeast Iowa.  The last glacier missed us and 
the results are beautiful.

We'll be camping next to the Twin Springs trout stream (bring your 
flyfishing gear or just a can of worms...but its a nice fishing spot) 
and the Upper Iowa River, considered as one of the top 10 river 
canoeing destinations in the upper Midwest.  Bicycling, tubing, 
antiquing, can all be found a-plenty.

Decorah is home of Luther College, the Vesterheim Norwegian Museum, the 
Seed Savers (recently featured in the National Geographic), and 
countless local spots of beauty and curiosity.

We'll be joined in the campground by a craft sale.  We'll do potluck.  
We'll have our own door prize giveaway.  Maybe a swap.  On Saturday 
we'll take a jaunt to the Mighty Mississip (only 40 miles away) to 
visit the Effigy Mounds National Monument and Pikes Peak (also 
discovered by Zebulon).  Its got a breathtaking view of the Mississippi 
valley and on a clear day you can see 4 states.

We've already got 15 vans signed on.  We'll camp "cozy" with multiple 
vans on each campsite.  Electrical is $14, non-electrical is $12.  I 
just need to know who's coming so I can go out mid-week and reserve 
some spaces.

Don't miss out!  Good friends, good sites, good location.....what more 
could you ask for?

Its like life:  don't miss it!

Give me a holler if you need more info!
