These are an item that I initially started carrying for the Vanagon
about two years ago, based on the advice of Just Kampers in the UK who
had received extremely good feedback from their customers. Based on the
equally positive feedback that I received from Vanagon owners I added
Bus applications early this year, and quickly sold out. But I have a new
shipment currently awaiting customs clearance, so they should be
available again within a week. While relatively unknown in the U.S.,
AlKo has been making shocks for quite a while in Europe, and their
shocks have the German T.U.V. stamp of approval. 

Like the stock Boge shocks that originally came on the Bus, these are
oil-filled, as opposed to the KYB's which are gas-charged. This means
that they have a smoother ride more like the original Boge's than the
stiffer KYB's (which some people complain can be bone-jarring on a Bus).
But they are also much heavier duty than the current-generation Boges
(which are now Mexican made). Compared side by side to a Boge they're
noticably beefier in construction, looking more like a Bilstein than a
KYB or Boge.  I like these shocks. They offer a lot for the money, and
I've received nothing but positive feedback from customers who have
tried them. In fact, at $39 each, I'd call them the best overall value
in a Bus shock.

I also carry them for '55-67 Bus, Bug/Ghia/Type3, and Vanagon.
