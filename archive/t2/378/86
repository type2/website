Subject: hole in tin?

Hi, I am trying to figure out all the holes in the tin and what should be in
them... so, 78 westy, right below the breather on the passenger side.  It is
right next to the case in the corner about 1/2" long and 3/8" wide with
rounded corners.  It goes through the tin that covers the top of the engine on
the passenger side  It is not the thermostat cable hole, I think.  What I
believe is the thermostat cable hole is smaller and to the outside.  .

thanks
