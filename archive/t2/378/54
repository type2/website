Hmmm, what is a "cu"  That isn't familiar to me.

Around here, dune buggy suppliers have all sorts of aftermarket hydraulic
components, and it doesn't seem like it would be too hard to hook up a
master cylinder to the clutch pedal.  I assume that the transmission you
are considering already has a slave cylinder.
