Subject: vacuum level

Well I tried my junk yard decel valve find today. No go. It drove the idle up
to about 2k rpm. Good thing I only paid 5 bucks for it.So I did some more
exstensive testing. As per the Bently I removed the hose from the valve to the
air intake boot and plugged the hole in the boot. When I ran the RPM's  up and
then released the throttle I got vacuum through the unplugged hole. So the
valve should be good right? So I figure that the leak is elsewhere. I get out
the vaccum tester and I have a solid 19" of vacuum, no fluctuating. Huh? Am I
missing something? I only have problems with the high RPM's when the engine is
warmed up. I hate vacuum leaks! What is the correct vacuum level I should
have?

For good news at least I found out why its running rich and getting poor
mileage. Fuel pressure was at 40lbs with no vacuum. New regulator goes in this
weekend.

Sorry for beating this issue to death and THANK YOU for all that have helped
out!
