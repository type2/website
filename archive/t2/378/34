Subject: Battery or Connection Problem?

I had my 73 Westy on the 2amp charger yesterday for about 14 hours yesterday
because it wouldn't start a few days ago.  This morning I went to start it.
I turn the key on/off a couple of times to prime the fuel pump (D-Jet FI
system).  The interior light was on and looked fine, and I heard the fuel
pump spin nicely.  When I turn the key to the "start" position, the gauges
IMMEDIATELY went dead and I had absolutely NO power to anything.  The
starter never turned over at all.  

Does this sound like a complete shot battery or some other malady?  I
checked the connections at the battery and they were OK.  Any suggestions
greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
