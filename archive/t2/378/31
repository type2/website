these are heat sinks to help even the bus heat out and more mass for the
heat.

either or, although there are no aftermarket J-tubes for the type IV
engine to my knowledge...I removed the heatsinks from my J-tubes to make
em lighter, but it is a lot of work to do this.
 I have never noticed any effect on the cooling of the bus itself with or
without the heatbox or the heat sinks vs the bar tube.,,I've run em all
three ways
