Subject: Click....Click...Help!

Here is an update on my problem. I have narrowed down the click problem I
described before.

I am hearing a 'click' when I lift off the accelerator. It seems to be
coming from the front right wheel.

It is not related to shifting like i thought before.

Any help out there?
