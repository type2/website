Subject: Re: [T2] looking for THIS hose - see MORE pics

I need to clarify that I searched for "automotive vacuum hose"...if you
look for "vacuum hose" you find everything you always wanted to know
about vacuum cleaners!  g

all this hose talk got me looking and thinking...i found a web site by
searching on netscape for "vacuum hose"  and found several suppliers. 
One had a size cross reference table and it said the 22mm id was the
same as 7/8 ".  I think I found it under air brake hoses.  While I
realize this isn't a vacuum hose I believe there may be generic
suppliers out there.  greg
