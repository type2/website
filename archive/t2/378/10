Subject: Different master cylinder?

Anyone got any good ideas on what to replace the rubber piece that fits around 
the nipple for the resevoir on top of master cylinder that goes on before you 
put the hose on. The hose was leaking and thats the culprit, or should I just 
take the whole hose off and get one that doesn't require the rubber piece. I 
was going to get a couple of fat rubber O rings that fit around the nipple and 
see how that worked.
