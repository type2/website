I'm sure it can be done.  You just have to workout the pushrod from the
clutch pedal to the clutch master cylinder......if a vanagon/T3 slave
cylinder doesnt work due to mounting concerns on a bus/t2 transaxle then
you could look into the various slave cylinders used (at least here in the
states) for these conversion to bug and bus transaxles for offroad use.

Could you clarify what a "cu engine" is?

I'm still not clear on what a "cu" is...but if you're refering to a
vanagon/t3 transaxle/gearbox the clutch connection will be the least of
your worries.

The shift linkage connects to the /side/ of these units instead of the
front, for one.  T2/bus nosecones/linkage will not fit.  You'll need to
fabricate connections for the shift linkage as well as a front mount
system.

If a "cu" is something else let us know and we'll offer what suggestions
we can. :)
