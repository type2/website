Subject: 79 engine question

I have my heater box off on one side, and I can see that the exhaust collector
pipe that attaches directly to the head has (or had) a sheet metal
wrapper...which, in my case, is partly missing...sort of eaten away. There
seems to be little purpose for this wrapper, other than to provide just a
little bit of insulation for the exhaust collector pipe. It is the same type
of a casement that would be found on an earlier heater box, except that it has
no apparent use in collecting and directing heated air.
Should I be concerned about this? (I'm trying to eventually get this bus back
on the road without completely tearing down and rebuilding it and have already
found and addressed a lot of little problems, and where I may eventually
rebuild it completely, I want to stop at some reasonable point).
A good parts guy out here, "Al", said that while I'm in that far I should
definitely replace the front engine crank seal. Why not? I replaced the rear
one when the resurfaced and balanced flywheel was put on. But since he did
mention it, I noticed quite a bit of accumulated oil on the front of the
engine block and even in the heater box that I removed. Overall, it was a
pretty dirty engine. Al said that this seal fails not infrequently. Any
thoughts on this?
