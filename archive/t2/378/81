Subject: RE: [T2] clunk clunk clunk from the rear, when turning right

The clunking while turning is classic CV joint failure noise. I had it a
year or two ago. I was able to drive a few weeks carefully.

Some play in the axial (left-right) direction is normal; if you move the bus
a little, you'll probably have play on the other side too. I believe this
play exists to allow the the wheel to move up and down (changing the
distance from wheel to tranny) without pulling the shaft out. Radial play
(up-down / forward-back) is not normal.

slow clunking when I do a tight turn to the right.  It sounds like it is
coming from the rear of the vehicle.  I have visually checked the CV boots
and they are all fine on that side, although I have never
had them off to repack them, though I did one on the other side and it was
fine.  Never touched the bearings, but don't see how it could be due to
them.

Does this sound like a gearbox/differential problem to anyone?

One thing I did notice was that I could push the stub shaft between the CV's
in the direction of the axis of the shaft, suggesting play of around 4 or
5mm.  This was only the case for the driver's side (right- I'm in the UK)
shaft.  I guess I'm due taking the shaft off to inspect, but I wanted to
seek an opinion first, because I'm paranoid of stripping the socket on those
hex bolts...
