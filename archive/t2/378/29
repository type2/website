Subject: Heat Exchangers/J-bars

Hello. I have a question about heat exchangers. Since I live in the
South West, I don't have much of a need for heat except for maybe two
months of the year. I removed the heat exchangers and removed the rusted
sheet metal to reveal the J-bars. Instead of finding standard J-bars
like the aftermarket parts I see, I found louvered heat dispersers on
the pipe. (I can post a picture if it will help my description) Will
this create any heating problems for the engine? Should I use regular
aftermarket J-bars or is there nothing to worry about? Any information
would be appreciated. Thanks Dave.
