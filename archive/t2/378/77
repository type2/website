    I knew somebody would be asking me for the size but to be honest I 
don't know exactly what size it is but I'm almost positive that it is 
3/4".  I do remember that the guy said the next size up would be 1" and 
judging by the fact that you were also resorting to the oil and hot 
water stretching makes me believe that we're dealing with the same size.

    Good point about the black hose.  It's the only thing I'd do 
differently.  But I admit,  blue is my favorite color .
