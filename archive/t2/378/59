Subject: Help getting bellhousing needed

I have spent two days roaming wrecking yards from Eugene almost
to Portland looking for a bellhousing for a 215mm flywheel.

Most buses I found were missing both the engine and tranny.

None had a tranny but no engine.

The ones with engines in them I could not touch unless I wanted
to buy the engine. One place even quoted me $2k for a 1.7l engine
of unknown functionality (I think there must be some really
good crack going around these parts.)

I just want a bellhousing that I can mount on an engine stand so I can
test engines out of the bus. Does anyone have one they would be willing
to sell me or know of a place that has one that would ship to me?

I'm quite willing to pay a fair price plus shipping.
