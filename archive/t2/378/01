selling a '77 Westy. But this is no plug! What is interesting about this particular auction is that they have
a photo of the
child's cot and curtain, all set up. I thought someone might want to look at
it or save the picture. I do that, too.. I save pictures of nice and
interesting vehicles or details about their interiors.

Do not believe what he says in the ad. That is NOT a 66 camper interior. It is 100% 1973 except for the
homemade front curtain.
The mustard CLOTH material was one-year-only 73.
The front cot is 68 and up because of the color. 67 and back was green.
The poles for the cot on 67 and back are shorter: front one is 47" long and the back one is 55 1/4" long. The
poles on a 68 to 73 bay are 56 1/4" long for both.
73 laminate is solid white.
66 laminate is white with fine black lines.
66 sink units do not have a bowl. The stainless bowl started in 69. [68's used a plastic bowl]
I love the grab handle on the roof where the light should be!!!!
There are a lot more inconsistancies but I will stop now.
