If it works on electricity but not on propane then there is nothing wrong
with the absorption refrigerator itself.  The problem has to be with the
propane burner not heating up what it is supposed to heat.

There is a general RV repair manual sold by RV dealers and bookstores that
covers absorbtion refrigerators.  It can be educational and perhaps useful
to you for this problem.  You really just need to pull the thing apart,
light it up, and look for obvious problems.

BTW, it takes a lot longer for most absorption refrigerators to cool down
on propane.  Are you giving it a full day?
