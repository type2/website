I was out at German Auto Salvage in Boring(yes that is a real town for you
non native Oregonians) just yesterday. They have at least two 75's in the
yard. One I know has the water tank.

I have seen an isolator system but stock it was wired through a relay. These
relay systems can be bought at any RV store or several on line vendors. Bus
Depot I know has them.

Running an invertor would drain the auxiliary in no time flat.

The right red lever starts the fan when pushed all the way down. How its
wired Im not sure. I'll take a look at mine.
