Just a PM inspection is in order. Check ball joints, suspension mounts, 
steering joints, and wheel bearings for play. Check shock mounts. Check 
brake fasteners, caliper and backing plate tight. Raise the wheel just off 
the ground with a wood block under the lower suspension arm. Pull on the 
tire back and forth in horizontal plane and see if you can replicate the 
click. If you can, a mechanics stethoscope can find it.
