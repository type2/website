Subject: Re: [T2] hole in tin?

I took a look at mine. I have the same hole but it looks more to be a slot
cut into the edge of the tin. You are right it is not the t-stat cable hole.
There is nothing in the hole in my tin either. I dont see it on the tin
diagram in the Bently. This same tin was used on the carburated engines
also, so Im thinking that maybe it could have been a cut out to fit around
something on these earlier engines.
