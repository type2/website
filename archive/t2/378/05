Subject: Last reminder: O'Leno, FL Love Bug Campout this weekend

Two more days until this weekend's campout at O'Leno State Park near High Springs.  Temps in the low 90's with plenty of cool springwater in the 
area for chillin' out.  On Saturday, a group will be paddling the blackwater and crystal springs of the Santa Fe River, while others are tubing the clear 
Ichetucknee River -- and presumably some will just loll about at the swimming area in the campground, like freshwater sea lions.

Bring bug spray - and a little fan helps sleeping at night in warm weather, for those who think it's still Spring.

p-mail for details if you haven't reserved your own campsite yet.  Hope to see you there!
