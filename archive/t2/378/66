That's good to know, but I believe the bellhousing situation will be the same
with a 411 or any other vehicle. The problem seems to be that when the
wrecking yard pulls the engine the tranny disappears with it.
Nobody had a tranny. I suspect that what they do is when someone buys
an engine the pull the engine and tranny together, sell the engine, and
pile the tranny up in the big heap of scrap that is off limits to customers.
Either that or they sell them to rebuilders as cores.  Either way, I don't
have access to them without buying an engine I don't need.
