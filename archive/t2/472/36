Certainly no misinformation. Any "how-to" will always have things left out,
but that video is pretty complete. It is really long, for one thing, so they
cover a lot of ground. I have referred back to it several times for little
procedures, for instance the one on distributor indexing is very good, as is
the one on indexing a bolt-on cam gear to the cam.
