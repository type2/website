Barry opines thusly:

"...Well, I also got a pair of those amber turn signal bulbs, and now
going out on *B*y [edited to avoid The Wrath of Admin] to find a pair of
clear front marker lenses so that I can make use of all the bulbs. "

Whoa...  Barry...  Kewl!  If you really are going for the height/depth
of kewlness, you shoulda been at www.brazilshopping.com back in the day
when they had not only "normal" orange lenses, way kewl kleer lenzez,
AND "dark tint" lenses too - front and back (amber bulbs, of course)...
For some reason, I'm no longer able to get into the bus lighting section
anymore.  I picked up a set along with one of Zarir's way cool
Brazi-style front grill for the '73 Deluxe...  Looks pretty slick with
the cream/beige paint combo, lightly tinted windows, and gold-tone MBZ
alloys.  But you better keep your sphincters screwed on pretty tight,
'cause they don't have (Hold your breath, volks!) US DOT markings on
them ("The horror... the horror...")  The front "dark tint" jobbies are
toadily kewl with with the amber t/s + parking bulb plus the clear side
marker bulb...  "Two, two, two colors in one!"

I need to eat some lunch now!
