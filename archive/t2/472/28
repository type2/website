Subject: Bug Me Type 4 Vid

Has anybody got any feedback on this Bug Me Vid of a teardown and rebuild of 
a type 4 with Jake Raby? I just bought one and wanted to know if there was 
any misinfo on it before commiting it to memory as law. I know Jake is known 
for his engine building prowess but you never know.
