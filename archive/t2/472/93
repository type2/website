Darren,
If the directions on the POR15 can are utilized and all the steps followed
correctly the POR will last a LONG time.  I used it on a few spots on my bus
at least 3 years ago and no signs of any rust through or advancement at all.
If I didn't know where it was I wouldn't be able to tell.

Hope this helps.. Be careful if you use it though as it stains your skin and
DOES NOT come off with anything but time...

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
