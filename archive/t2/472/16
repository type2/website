Subject: RE: [T2] new temperature sensor source?

  I just listed all the current Bosch numbers for sensors that are
available;


>022-906-041 - Bosch Part number is 0 280 130012 (I have it listed as a
Bosch part)
>
I have an original sensor with both Bosch 0 280 130 012 and VW 022-906-041
printed on it. Just find that Bosch number at your favorite online vendor.


022-906-041 stock for FI Bus -  Bosch 0 280 130 012  ($27.59) b mover
311-906-041A supercedes 022-906-041 which supercedes to- Bosch pt number 0
280 130 003 (19.04) d mover
022-906-041A not 100% positive but I think this will lean out the mixture. -
bosch no"
 0 280 130 017 (32.76) w mover

as you can see the 012 is still a good seller where as the 017 is at the
bottom of the list

<all the above sensors are still available>
The 003  is for a type 3
The 012 is for a type 4
Still trying to cross reference the 017. The problem is none of my Bosch
books list applications


I have no idea what these Bosch numbers map to so it's probably best to
avoid them if you ever get a local monkey trying to pawn you one.

0 280 130 003
0 280 130 017
