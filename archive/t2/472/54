Subject: Re:Real or Photoshop? 

Interesting. I work with PhotoShop several hours almost every day. I copied 
the web photo and opened it in PS and did some levels adjustments.  It 
looks like someone used a blur tool on big areas of pixels in the forest 
background at the front of the bus.  And the background that is visible 
through the windshield is too good and the same area has a perfect right 
angle in the frame under high zoom....reminds me of what you see when you 
use a rectangular selection tool. Also, the pattern of the ground on which 
the beast sits is like those available with the custom shape tool.

It feels like photoshop in lots of places.
