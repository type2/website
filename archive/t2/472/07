Well,small change of plans.
Due to the extreme cold and snow I am not painting the van in tempura paint.
I don't think i want to have to wash it afterwards in the cold.

However I haven't given up the fight!!!
So in preparation I have created the paint in magnetic form.
Here is the stuff before I have put them on.

My only fear is if I leave them out with trickortreaters running around they 
will
get stolen so I will take them off if I go anywhere for too long hehe.

Tomorrow morning they are all going on for the trip to work as well as my 
costume.
Trust me, pictures will be taken.

Go check them out.. and yes it took a while to create them all.

James
