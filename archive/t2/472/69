Subject: Accurate oil temps?

I changed the oil today and I thought it would be a good idea to check the
accuracy of the oil temp sender I put in the sump plate a while back.
Everyone seems to have a different opinion on oil temps but what got me
interested was the reason why Gene Berg doesn't sell gauges:

I built a similar setup like I did for my temp sensor II experiment: stove
top, canola oil, digital turkey thermometer, etc.

I wired the standard 300F VDO oil temp gauge to the 323 888 sender and
watched the oil temps from 120F to 300F as I turned up the stove top
element.

I was disappointed to discover, just a Berg stated, that the oil temp gauge
always lagged the digital thermometer by 40F. That's a pretty big
difference. What was more interesting was that after waiting a while with
the oil at 300F I noticed that the temp gauge eventually caught up.

Watching the temperature drop from 300F back down to 120F I noticed that the
temp sender kept perfect pace with the thermometer.

Basically what this means is that if you gauge is reading 230F and you just
noticed it while driving, it was that temperature 3-4 minutes ago and the
current temperature is probably quite a bit higher.

Anyone have a similar experience or solution for a VDO compatible sender
with a quicker response time?
