Hi Bob,

Start off by looking for a dead bulb. Verify fault to bulb or socket, 
replace/repair as required. It could be that simple.

If no bulbs are dead, check the flasher unit.  It's located under the 
dash on the backside of the fusebox. Unfortunately the flasher is 
mounted upside down, and if your windshield leaks it will fill with 
water, rendering it non-operational. Check to see if it's properly 
seated, and swap with a known-good unit.

If not bulbs or flasher, it's a switch or wiring problem.

Happy trails,
