actually, go get yourself a new rotor and push the ring all the way down.
the guys at bill n steve's warned me of this when i bought mine.  you
really need to push hard to get it all the way on.  you might use a deep
socket to help press it on.

 Then I found the distributor rotor would not go on far
enough to engage the internal protrusion with the slot on the distributor.
The magnetic collar would not let it go down far enough.  -
