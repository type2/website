Subject: Non Blinking Turn signals - where to start ?

Looking for some ideas on where to start...

77 Westy.

Non blinking turn signals, When either signal is
turned on lights come on and stay on.  Emergency
Flashers do the same.  No internal clicking sound.

What is the standard trouble shooting steps ?

Thanks
Bob
