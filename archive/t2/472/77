Subject: Re: [T2] Accurate oil temps?

Working in the instrument and control shop of a nuke power plant i can tell
you that any mechanical gage will have a lag time and the digital will
usually be faster but that the gages are still necessary for trending which
is where they shine.  i think the berg temp stick is your best bet giving
you the idiot light for oil temp.  it can be adjusted up to more accuratly
alarm at the appropriate temp for a t4 motor as it is set up for a t1 motor
from berg.
