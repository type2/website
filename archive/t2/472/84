Subject: looking for vanagon plastic model?

Hi,

I've found reference to a Revell plastic model kit of the 
Vanagon from the Magnum P.I. tv show.

Its the only Vanagon model I've found reference to other than
a Westy.

I think the Revell kit number is 7328 but I believe it is
discontinued.

Anyone no of good places to look for discontinued models of 
our toys?


Sincerely,
