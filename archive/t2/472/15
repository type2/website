Compare the no. of Rolls on the road to German cars, or just VW, or just VW 
BUSVANs. Compare the price. Compare the utility. Compare the ease or 
difficulty of service. Compare Lucas to Bosch on any level. Compare cost of 
operation. If you come up with English as beste, sell the VW and get a 
Jaguar or Rover. Then double your maintenance budget compared to any German 
car.
