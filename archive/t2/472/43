Subject: T4 Flywheel- M 7 holes

I have a T4 flywheel that has M7X1 pressure plate bolt holes

It seems to be new, I went to use it, bolted it to the engine, then found
out it had the small pressure plate holes.

I don't have the M 7 bolts, or the corresponding pressure plate, so I used
another flywheel to get the job done

I am wondering if i should drill out the M 7 and make them M 8?

I guess the other option would be to offer it to anyone who needs a 215mm
T4 flywheel with the M 7 bolts holes.

What year used this arrangement?
