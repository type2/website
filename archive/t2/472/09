Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch Red Coil again

Roberto,
the red coil is best suited for electronic ignitions.  It has a 1 to 1.2
Ohms resistance.  You can increase to 3 or so with a resistor and that is
what you need for point ignition.  Then you might as well use a blue coil
that is rated at 3 to 3.5 out of the box.

These red coils are fine, I use it in my 73 with electronic ignition and
dowel control.  Always look for "Made in Germany"
