Subject: Ashley's New Engine - with pictures

It's time a for a new engine for Ashley. I've been and collected it, so
there is a nice wooden box from REMTEC awaiting a trip to the mechanic.

Pictures at: http://www.pagenumberone.co.uk/veedubs/engine.htm

Along with scans of the warranty for those who are interested.

Enjoy :-)
