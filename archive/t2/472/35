I don't know about performance mods or non-stock distributors but I've always seen it listed as 0.016. Before I switched to electronic ignition I never got the gap right the first 10 times and had to rely on a dwell meter. Relying on the dwell value primarily and having tested several settings I can tell you that the list advice is right on when it says that the most power is made when the dwell is at 50 degrees even.
