Subject: Emergency brake level to brake shoe fastener

So I'm in the process of changing my rear brake shoes and the lever that goes
from the brake shoe to the cable appears to be fastened to the shoe with some
sort of rivet.  This can't be right - I suspect these are the original shoes
to my bus.  On my 60 the lever is attached to the shoe via this little pin
that has a clip on the other side.  The Bentley shoes this on the 70's buses
as well.  What's the story on these rivet type things?  Is there a way to get
them out short of grinding off one side?  I'm doing the rear brakes on a 78.

TIA
