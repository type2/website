Subject: Re: [T2] Bug Me Type 4 Vid

I used it on my 2.0L Hydraulic lifter rebuild and found it invaluable. It is
a very easy step-by-step guide that helps you do the job yourself properly
the first time. I did sway from the video slightly when I did some
performance mods, but overall I give it two thumbs up!!
