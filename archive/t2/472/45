Subject: Sad Day.

Recently, the nature of my work changed and I'm forced to drive longer 
distances. Unfortunately "Uh-Oh" no longer fits in the picture. 
Therefore, it is with a heavy heart that I have to try to find a new 
home for her. Let me give you all the sad details.

I initially set out with the hope that I would be able to fix her and 
use her to drive the long distances. So I ordered the parts I needed, 
new carbs, and a new head. (and other accessories) All was going well 
during the work, motor came out easily (thanks to an input shaft that 
stayed in place this time) and I removed everything necessary to replace 
the right head on the motor. I began the torque down sequence on the 
head.....

SNAP

One of the cylinder head studs broke :-((( I honestly cried. The Bus has 
always been my favorite and I was now lost. (and feeling like I had done 
something horribly wrong) So I sat down and thought long and hard, 
eventually I broke down and bought a Jeep Cherokee. (Much to my wifes 
happiness and continued sanity) For me this killed two birds with one 
stone. I had just bought a stripped Samurai to build into a rock 
crawler, and it had lots of room for stuff, and I need a car to get to 
work.

So here is the deal.

For Sale: One loved 1972 Westy with motor out and a new head, two brand 
new carbs (no gas through them yet). And a lot of other stuff I took 
care of.

I am in Modesto, CA and only want one solid person to come and get her 
for the low price of $1200.  You haul, I can't ship. etc.

Let me know through PM if you're interested or know of someone who is 
and we'll talk.
