Sorry Bob, you have it backwards. You need to remove the lens from any USA bus and look. You will see the
little bulb for the side marker. Federal law required the side marker light. It is in EVERY USA front 73-79
light. Euro lights did not have the little bulb.
Yes, the large bulb is a dual dual filament; it is the park light and the turn signal.
Look at the 77/78 wiring diagram in the Bentley. M11 at location 31 and 32. The wires for them come from M1
and M3.

Like I said, MOST are burned out and people don't even know they are there!
