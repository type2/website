John, don't know what gen you are using, most of them in use nowadays
are 30 amp. They keep up OK with everything turned on and just a little
more, but you can see obvious voltage drops when everything is on when
you slow down to an idle where the gen/VR cuts out. Having an extra
battery with accessories is nice but also adds to the load on the points
of your VR. Your listed accessories, minus the gas heater, won't put
much at all of any additional load to your existing system.

Just for myself, I like the 50 amp Motorola alternators for two reasons,
50 amps and charging down to idle speeds.

just my two cents, you don't have to give me change!

So would electrical requirements for these things
dictate that I hook up an auxillary battery??
In the T2 library, found an article about hooking one
of these up, but the reading wasn't very
user-friendly. I will never have a need to run a
fridge off of this system, only small 9 inch tv\vcr
and a gas heater. Anyone have any advice about an easy
set up to do this??
So does someone sell a kit to add this, I need easy
install and clear directions.
