Hi Paul,

On the 1974 engine in my westfakia I had to trim the rotor to fit. 
There was no way on God's green earth it would have fit otherwise, it 
was already pressed all the way to the bottom of the shaft.

Perhaps David has a different distributor than what's in your bus. Or 
maybe just a different rotor.

Anyway, once that was taken care of the thing worked great.

Happy trails,
