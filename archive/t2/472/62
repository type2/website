What matters isn't the correct gap, but the correct dwell angle, which is
what the coil requires to work properly.  Due to the variance in point
rubbing block material and contact shape the actual gap can vary widely,
but dwell never lies.  Any of the gaps abover are sufficient to get the
engine running, and often to have it run well, but for best results you
need to put a dwell meter on the coil and adjust to the optimum dwell
spec.
