OK.  Now fess up...

How many of us ran out to our trusty late bay and pulled a front turn 
signal/marker len, and then saw the 12V 4W bulb (or hole where the 12V 4W 
bulb use to be).

But how many of those of us who did not believe then ran a continuity check 
to be assured that the bulb was indeed burned out.

And, then ran to the local auto parts store to buy a set of Sylvania 12V 4W 
3893 bulbs (-at-) $2.19 a pair??


Well, I also got a pair of those amber turn signal bulbs, and now going out 
on EBay to find a pair of clear front marker lenses so that I can make use 
of all the bulbs.


And while I was at my FLAPS, I picked up a set of mini feeler gauges, so I 
could slip a tiny gauge (.016") for my points setting.  Another $3.99 
investment.
