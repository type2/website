Subject: short in our bus

In May of this year we finally finished restoring our bus and have been 
driving since. The problem is in July the new battery that we had installed would 
not crank the engine over, so back to NAPA we went, they checked it and said it 
was junk and gave us a new one, now November, the bus would not crank again. 
Back to NAPA, another dead battery, they replaced it again but said this was 
it and to look for a short that would be draining the battery to this point, so 
my question is how to find shorts. Someone at NAPA said to hook up a volt 
gauge between either the + or - they could'nt remember which one and if 
everything is off and it shows voltage then somewhere there is a drain. How do I find 
it, and does anyone have a good wiring diagram for 72 colored, thanks for the 
help.
