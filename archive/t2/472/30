Subject: BN4 GAS HEATER

Happy Halloween everyone,

I recently posted a message about my BN4 gas heater in my 72 van.
I would flick the switch and hear the fuel pump a tickin and the fan
a blowin but no heat and the safety switch would trip after about 1 minute.
I finally got the glow plug out, it was all black and silty.
I cleaned her up and put it back in and presto, after about 30 seconds the
heat started
coming out and about 30 seconds after that she reved up and really started
pumpin out
the good heat. Yahoo.

Thanks everyone, especially James Cotter who had the correct fix.

Darren
