Subject: Front Turn Indicator City Lights

OK, I replaced the small 4 watt bulb in my front turn indicator assembly 
('78 Westy)

But both bulbs (4 W & light/turn) come on in each assembly when I turn the 
parking and when I turn the driving lights on.

I want the small, 4 watt bulb to come on when I turn my ignition on, and the 
other bulb to come on when the lights are turned to park or driving.

Anybody have the answer??  If so, please RSVP.
