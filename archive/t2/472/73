A zip-tie will prevent this embarrasment, I promise you.  Various years ov
Volkswagens have varying numbers of ring terminals attached to that post,
but the one characteristic they all share is that they are all full rings.
A zip-tie or the twit-tie from a bread bag will keep them all in one place
an prevent "lost" or "forgotten"  wires.

I agree that your solenoid may be cooked.  It may be savable with removal,
lubrication, and reinstallation but since you can buy the solenoid
separately for only $20 or so this is probably not worth trying.

                             OOK!
