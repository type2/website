Subject: Defrost Tube?

Hello,

Is the defrost tube (metal) that sits just in front of the hand break lever 
difficult to install? I have removed the plastic tube portion that goes to 
the dash, so I have lots of room to maneuver. But it is taking a lot of 
muscle to put in place. Is this normal?

Thanks in advance, Phil
