Subject: RE: [T2] Glisten PC Clearcoat

I have not tried the Glisten PC Clear Coat, but I have used the clear Pelucid
on wood and it worked great, The wood was very soft to start with and this
really made it hold up well. Not rock hard, but enough to put a TV on the
stand and not get dents. The wood by itself would get dented by the TV. I
think they said that it would work on metal. It might be worth a shot if you
have a test spot like the inside of the hub cap.

You need to take a piece of plastic wrap and put it between the lid and the
can when you close it. This will allow you to get it open later. I have used
this with Por 15 for years and never had trouble getting them back open. Just
use a new piece of plastic wrap each time :)
