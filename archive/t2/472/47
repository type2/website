Subject: halloween was a success!

I successfully made it through halloween without being nightsticked
on the side of the road by bored police ;)

Everyone loved it and couldn't believe how awesome it turned out.
Had several people asking where I bought them and where they could
get some too.

Best quote by a 14 yr old girl
"when I turn 16 can I buy your van?"

I even had an older lady say 'I can remember back in the day that
people believed in that saying.. not just something neat to write on
a van..'  (when you see the pics you will know what I am talking about)

They all stuck on, none came off on the highway in the cold and gusting
wind and I had a continual line of smiling faces where ever we went.

Yah, I know.. my costume isn't included in the pics.  I took these before it
got dark and had no one to hold the camera with me in it. However there
are some digital cameras floating around with pics of me and the van 
together.

Amazing nite and lost of fun.  And the best thing is I can use them whenever 
:)

Check out the directory and see them (4 pics)
