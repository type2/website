Subject: Re: [T2] Auxillary battery

John,

I have a '79 Auto Westfalia that I use about 9 months of the year.

I run a dual LCD screen system in my bus and it works flawlessly.

Its a 12V system that plugs into a standard 12V accessory outlet that can be
easily wired through the fuse panel.

I don't have an auxiliary battery, I have a BA6 and a fridge and I have
never had a problem yet, but I suspect it would be nice to have, just in
case.

Mind you , I don't run all those with the vehicle off, I usually switch over
to 120V when I arrive.

Jamie Rivers (jrivers(-at-)globalserve.net) has a diagram on wiring up an aux
battery, its probably in the archives or the library somewhere.
