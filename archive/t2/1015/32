My system is also not very quiet.  I recently put mufflers on that  
are about 2 inches longer than my original's and that helped a little  
bit.  I think the only other way to get it quieter would be with a  
resonator.  I am not sure how much room I have for them behind the  
mufflers though.

On a side note, I have been chatting with others about possibly  
adding a cross pipe somewhere.  The going word is that a system like  
mine with less restriction can lead to a fall off in torque.  Does  
anyone have solid evidence of that?

Peace, Troy
