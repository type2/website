Subject: Re: [T2] small portable toilet to fit between bay window front 

And to think I wasted money on a subwoofer and a box that fit there.  I was going to use the wood laminate for the sides and seating material to make a seat that looked like the original except for the fact that it sits on legs.  Hinged of course, with a shallow compartment underneath to hold my minidisk player, switches, wiring, etc to easily switch between the stereo, ham radio,  video, or whatever else.  It'd also be a heck of a place to sit with the subwoofer cranked.    The possibility of a center 'toilette' makes me rethink the proposition. But then, as used as I am to carrying a load of crap, I'm not sure I want to ride next to it all day.  I've been looking to find a way to fit one between the sink and the back bench.  But I'd have to toss the table and do something with the fitting that holds the leg.  It's pretty useless anyway.   Not sure any of the porties fit in that hole, though.  Ah, the possibilities.   I still haven't figured out where to put the shower. 
 Or the hot tub.  :)  Happy Trails....KR

seats or the gap between the rear sink cabinet and the bedseat. We made 
a cover from the blue-green material of the seats.  I cut a 1/4" plywood 
board and glued it to the plastic seat cover to strenghen it so one 
could walk/sit on it. If you flatten the tire cover into a hinged door 
as we did, thaen it will also fit where you see the garbage stool.
