Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger "refresh"

In the spirit of the domino effect, refreshing my heater boxes moved to
cleaning and refreshing my heater tubes.

I started following Stiles lead:
http://www.jonathanstiles.com/HeaterTubeRefurbish.htm

Since at this time I cannot afford to get the inner heater tubes that he
used. I wanted to wash and refresh, reuse or replace the fabric that is
currently being used. My inner tubes were insulated with a bluish material
that washed clean very easily and then wrapped in a particle-fabric similar
to using dryer lint to insulate.

My question is, how hot does a heater tube typically get to where it is of
the utmost importance to ensure that flame retardant insulation is being
used? The two fabrics used for insulating the tube for as long as it has
been in the shape it is are NOT (I tested with a match). Any suggestions as
to which material would be the best idea, or does it even get hot enough in
there to worry about?
