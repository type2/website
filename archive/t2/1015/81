Subject: Heavy Duty Cooling Fan

Well, I bought a fan from JC Whitney which was labelled as "High Volume"
cooling fan. It appears to be just that, but it doesn't fit my 73 1800 Type-4
motor. When I ordered it, it stated that it was acceptable for my year VW Bus.
Apparently it's not.

I live in South Florida, and I'd really like to get a high volume fan to help
my Bus run cooler. Where can I get one???


Thanks guys,

Todd
