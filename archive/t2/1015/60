I used to live in KC.  You mentioned that they've already had a mechanic 
look at it.  If they want a second opinion I would suggest they have the 
vehicle looked at by the folks at Vee Village.  They were very good 
people, and had locations both downtown and on Shawnee Mission Parkway. 
  It's been 10 year or more, but I imaging they're still around.

Good luck to Randy in his journey to PA.
