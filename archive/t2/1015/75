I had the Thetaford 135 for many years. It fit perfectly under the
rearward facing seat in my '72 Westy. When camping I would take it out
and put it in the side tent (or outside, depending on how remote I
was). Wound up selling the van, moved the Thetaford to my sailboat.
Finally sold it with the boat. Never had a lick of trouble with it.
(eew... that sounds gross).
