Greg:

Yuck!

We have a Chrysler Town & Country that is a family truckster, no more.  We
refer to it as "The Pig".  It inspires no excitement, no desire to drive it
any more than to get from one point to the other.  I can't imagine camping
in it.

On the other hand, I sometimes just go sit in the bus and have a beer to
collect my thoughts or comtemplate life.  When you open that slider door,
it's just an adventure waiting to happen in there.

 I hope they don't do a camper conversion, it would be wrong.
