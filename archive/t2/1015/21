Apologies on the delayed reply.

I've wanted to try the Quiet Car ever since ratwell posted it on the  
list a while back.  I haven't had a chance yet, but I have been using  
Dynamat Extreme.  Besides the wheel wheels up front, the area where I  
saw(heard) major improvements was over the engine bay....as others  
have said.  I wish I had a db meter to measure before I applied all  
of these :(  Although I have note measured, I don't believe my single  
applications are 3mm thick.  A second layer would probably make a  
huge impact....on the wallet too.
