Subject: small portable toilet to fit between bay window front seats?

Does anyone have a brand name and size for a proper small toilet (not the bucket type) that has a small holding tank and pump handle that would fit between the front seats in a 77 Westy camper? That way it would double as a small table (yes with the lid down, otherwise it would be a drink holder) :-b  Price would be good and where you got it as well!
Thanks,
Courtney
