Subject: Not using Heater boxes??!!

There was someone on the list, who was running just 'tubes", and not heater
boxes, about 4 months ago,I seem to remember he said head temps were fine, and
to make SURE you ran the pushrod tube heat deflector, if you did this.  Can
that person 'step' forward, and contact me off line, I am at the point of
"yes' or "no" to the heater boxes in my reassembly.  Thanks
Sid
