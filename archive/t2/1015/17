Subject: Nicest Westy ever on ebay

Dear Type 2 Members,
 
     Due to family financial needs, I am forced to part  with one of the 
nicest items I have ever owned in my life.  If you know of  a good family for her 
I would greatly appreciate it if you let them know she is  available for 
adoption!
 
Thanks!
Tom
