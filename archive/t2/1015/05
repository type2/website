You know, Steve can keep some stuff in a bus/vanagon folks, like half an apartments worth of stuff plus all his tools.  Of course I had an '85 driver beater with the middle seat out about 10 years ago where the piles of stuff reached a level even with the back seat across the floor...  I only cleaned it out because a mouse moved in during the winter and I was tired of him scurrying around.  In my defense I bought it in DC and put the engine into it in Steve's little garage in Springfield (now you want to talk overpacked with stuff) so I think the Vanagon had caught something while there and was collecting junk on its own.
