Subject: Re: [T2] What size?

Jason,

I don't know the answer off the top of my head.
But to be absolutley sure of what I was bying I'd do one of two things--

One--go VW and order what I needed.

Two-- take one of the other good studs out and spin a metric nut on each
end till you get a couple of nuts that fits the stud properly.

I do know that if you had a metric sample in your hand, and the guy at
the NAPA store couldn't figure this solution out---
Beware of this nut case.

He's dangerous.

Be sure what grade stud your buying too---
If it's Chinese or from Tiawan--it's a grade 3 or no more than 5-- much
too soft. 

If it;s a Dormann stud--it's at least a grade 8 and correct.
