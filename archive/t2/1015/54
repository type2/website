Subject: Unusual cliutch failure causing both hard shifting and clutch

My bus became very hard to shift and at the same time the new clutch began 
to slip. I removed the recently rebuilt engine and inspected the clutch, 
throwout bearing, etc. All looked OK. Was about to take the transaxle out 
when I decided to call a transmission expert. I was told not to touch the 
transaxle until I had eliminated the clutch as a problem. Went out to check 
the clutch and disc further. They looked perfect and almost new. Then as I 
was placing the pressure plate into the flywheel recess I heard a clink and 
found a rivet head. The rivet had broken from the interior of the Brazilian 
pressure plate and was keeping the pressure plate from holding the disc 
against the flywheel. Rivet also kept the clutch from releasing completely 
causing the hard shifting.

Anyone else have experience with this type of pressure plate failure?
