Subject: Westfalia from Kansas City to western PA

A guy I know (Randy), who comes to the VW cruises and shows around my area, is flying out to KC on the 10th of December to drive a '71 Westfalia that his son bought back home to West Alexander, PA (on I 70 just across the West Virginia/Pennsylvania state line)? 
It is their first bus, but Randy has had several Betles and currently has a '74 Super.
They've had a mechanic check it out out there and everything seems mechanically OK and they are taking along some spares,? but if anyone sees a stranded Westy beside the road between KC and PA, please help them out.? Good folks.
Thanks, 
Greg
Moundsville, WV
