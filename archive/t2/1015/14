Hi Rob,

I'd suggest you reorder elsewhere, it's available online from many  
vendors. Perhaps someone on this list will offer to sell you a spare  
copy of theirs, or you can often find them on eBay. The Bentley is a  
must-have; it's WAY more informative, esp. with a later baywindow.



Happy Trails,
