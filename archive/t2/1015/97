Subject: Gauge Cluster

Hey guys,

     I was just thinking. I'm involved in a few other cars, and I know that
typically they offer aftermarket parts and such for the various different
parts. For example, the Pontiac Fiero, Pontiac Solstice, the Porsche 944,
etc...

With that in mind, I'm wondering if anyone has ever created a "gauge cluster"
that neatly fits in the clock slot on the right-hand side? I would LOVE to
have something that gave me volts, oil pressure, oil temperature, etc...

Does anyone make that?

It might have been Stiles, Andy, or Don that told me this... but there's some
VW that has a gauge cluster that fits right into that slot that has all those
gauges already? Would someone be able to give me more information on that? I'm
really sorry, I lost all my old e-mails a while back, but I'd really like to
install that. I don't like too much custom stuff, and that would be the
closest to somewhat factory that I could think of.

Thanks!!!

Todd
