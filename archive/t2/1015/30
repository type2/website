Subject: Re: Audi heated seats

Varies year to year to year, about all of the 5000CS's and 200's from the late 80s to early 90s and most 100s of the same vintage into the mid/late 90's have them (and of course newer Audi's as well.)  Often Audi 80s and 90s of the same vintage had them on more topped out level cars (most Audi 90s)  The controls are in various locations but mostly in the center console above the shifter, has a little dial and picture of seat with "heat" radiating out of it, separate controls for passenger and driver.  Top end VW's of the 1990s often have the same, in fact I sweat but can't remember for sure that my '91 Corrado had each of the front seats with seperately adjustable heat for the backrest and the seat bottom, two dials on each of two controls.  Most VW's of that vintage had them as part of "cold weather" packages with heated washer nozzles as well, which were available for vanagons, and hence could be used for Buses I surmise but don't know for sure as again I've never seen on
 so equipped in the US, only pics from European sites.  Would be real slick to have heated washer nozzles in an air cooled Bus though.  I have no pics, they are in my mom's CRV back in WV, I am in AK.  I did the install 6-7 years ago, still flawless now.  The ones I used needed only elements and controls, a little of the wiring harness for connectors but mostly a home made harness, however I think some of them have relays for some years, I only know that the ones I used did not.

  
what year Audis had the heated seats ?

how can you tell ? are there wires hanging from the seat ?

where is the dash control ? is there anything else I would need to get ?
