Subject: Re: [T2] What is VW Thinking?

Hi Pete,

Maybe they are thinking:


"Sure wish I had a van on the lot that I could sell to the new  
parents who bought Jetta's and Golf's from me 2 years ago. I could  
make a bundle on the trade-in."

"With Barbie and Ken's relationship in tatters, I guess we should  
bury that "new microbus" idea. Barbie has completely ruined it for  
us. We are going to need something more conventional".

"VW customers are demanding a van imported from a foreign country  
with a high-value currency. Let's build it in Canada!!"


I can't wait to see if they do a camper conversion. Before long  
people will be doing winni-fakias based on older chryslers, and the  
world will spin off its axis....

Happy Trails,
