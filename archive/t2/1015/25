Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Heated Seats

"However I don't think $90 a seat for a new set is bad, Audi usually wants $100-200 just for one element"

I went to the IPD website and couldn't find the kits anymore, I found this kit for 80 bucks though, and these people say that they are the OEM supplier for VW and Subaru and just about everybody http://www.heatedseatkits.com/heatedseatkits/iheat2/index.html
I did find something kind of cool at IPD for warmth though, the 12V heated blanket http://www.ipdusa.com/product.asp?strParents=&CAT_ID=0&P_ID=166&strPageHistory=search&numSearchStartRecord=1  I have been thinking about putting in 12V outlets above my sink in the trim piece for my Bus Depot string of lights so I can unplug them afterI get in bed, and so I can plug in my DVD player and keep watching it when the battery gets low.
I really like my Bus Depot lights, extremelly bright, very nice for hanging out in the bus while camping and finding my bus at larger campouts.
