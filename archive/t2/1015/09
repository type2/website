Subject: Bus Heated Seats

I want to make the seats in my '77 Westy electrically heated, has anybody done this?  How did you do it? How much did you spend?

IPD has DIY heated seat kits for 90 bucks a seat, last time I checked, but that seems a little spendy.

I want to rebuild my seats and would like to add heat at the same time.

Thanks,
James in Portland, Oregon

This is tough for me, I have made fun of heated seats many times, but in the absence of great heat in my bus I think its a good idea, plus I have to admit that it feels good on the lower back after a hike.
