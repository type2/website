Subject: Rear defoggers

Hi,

Was thinking about getting a rear window for my split with a defogger. After 
all these years, do the defoggers still work? Or do they get old and degrade 
with time? Can a good window with the lines intact be had from a junk yard?

Are there any kits out there for adding defoggers to rear windows?

Thanks,
Chris
