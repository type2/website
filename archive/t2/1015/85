Subject: Re: [T2] simple, custom exhaust for our '78

I bought one of these for my 2275CC Type1 performance engine at our local 
flaps (Lordco) on sale for 30 bucks, so you could save some money on that by 
shopping around. Whether a muffler shop would do the work IF you didn't buy 
from them might be a diff. story though.
My thought on this would also be: Could we use the stock 180 degree pipes 
that hook up to our heat exchangers rather than have a shop fab. 180 deg. 
turnarounds? Then all you'd need would be a matching flange and straight 
pipe to the muffler inlet. Rest would be like the pics posted. I don't know 
if that would be much of a cost savings however?? Just thinking out loud.
