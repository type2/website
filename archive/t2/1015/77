Subject: Re: portable toilet will fit where table hardware was

Note http://www.geocities.com/mike_benthin -our 78 Westy used for 22 
years now.
The PakaPotti II (12.5"wide) or the Pakapotti 2000 (13") we also have 
fits easily between sink cabinet and the rear bedseat front-Nyssa spent 
her early years in just this spot, with her legs resting on the toilet 
or garbage seat, which fits there also (with table leg mount gone).
We tossed the table and leg as not worth their bulk and made one that 
hinges off the sliding door just under the window. A 1/2" ply table does 
NOT interfere with opening the door! We keep a cooler behind the 
passenger seat so it is cut to just clear the cooler.
Note that the space in the back allows a 15" wide potty and the space in 
front requires a sub 14" wide placed before or behind the seatbelt 
mounts.  It will fit behind the mounts if you Flatten the tire cabinet 
cover to a hinged door and provide an "elevated floor" behind the heat 
outlet.  We stopped that outlet up to give more to the front; the back 
one under the bedseat is enough.

(caveat- good while driving, get the portable outside one out for camping).

  sure any of the porties fit in that hole, though.
