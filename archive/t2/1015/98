Subject: Re: [T2] small portable toilet to fit between bay window front

I have a Thetford Electronic Porta Potti in my SMB---

The instruction booklet sez that the commode is 15 7/8" high,
17" long, & 15 1/4" wide.

My 74 isn't here at home so I can't measure the width in between the
seats.

However, SMB has a real nice rolled & pleated naugahyde cover that fits
over the the Porta Potti-- and  it looks like a stool.

Not unattractive at all.

You could put it anywhere inside the Bus and never know what it was.

Pretty nice, compact, very efficient, easy to use waste collector---and
not bad looking when it's parked.
