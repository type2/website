Subject: Re: What is VW Thinking?

Don't get me wrong, my wife and I love our 73 VW Bus, and I'll never get rid 
of it. But I don't realy claim allegance to any particular brand. If 
anything, maybe Pontiac since I've owned about 13 different ones since 1996. 
But, I think the reason VW picked Chrysler is in many respects due to their 
reputation. As much as Honda would like to pretend that their vans are like 
the shag-vans of the 70s (Ford, Chrysler, Dodge cargo vans), and as much as 
Toyota would like to think that their minivan is world renouned... the truth 
is that Chrysler has always had the most reliable minivans in the United 
States.

Considering how many major problems VW has had in the past few years, they 
REALLY need this to go well for them. They REALLY need a cash cow. The last 
thing VW needs is a repeate of what happened to all of their Jettas from 
2002 and before.
We had a 2002 1.8T Jetta, and while it was a great car, man... it was in the 
shop 23 times before it even hit 12,000 miles. Every other time my wife 
turned the key, it either didn't start, or something broke on it. both front 
windows (of course), the battery, the ignition coils, the ECM, they had to 
reflash the ecm about a dozen times because the check engine light kept 
coming on. They finally reflashed the ECM with a significantly lower 
performance programming that it ended up driving like the lesser 1.8T model 
(we had the 180hp 1.8T Sport edition). We were so angry, they bought the car 
back from us, and sold us a 2004 VW Beetle Convertible for only $2,000 
additional dollars.


BELIEVE ME... I'd like to have a new camper / hippie Bus as much as the rest 
of you... but VW REALLY needs this...
