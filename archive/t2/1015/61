Hi Greg,

Be sure to tell them to take along a copy of the airs list for the  
states that they are passing through.

A guy I know (Randy), who comes to the VW cruises and shows around my  
area, is flying out to KC on the 10th of December to drive a '71  
Westfalia that his son bought back home to West Alexander, PA (on I  
70 just across the West Virginia/Pennsylvania state line)?
It is their first bus, but Randy has had several Betles and currently  
has a '74 Super.
They've had a mechanic check it out out there and everything seems  
mechanically OK and they are taking along some spares,? but if anyone  
sees a stranded Westy beside the road between KC and PA, please help  
them out.? Good folks.
