That's kind of my problem. I don't really KNOW if it's running too hot. I 
just am not used to air cooled engines except my lawn mower and yard tools.

Sometimes, the oil dipstick tube is too hot to handle, and the rear bumper 
also gets warm to the touch... not HOT, but warm.

It's a pretty new motor, it's an 1800 CC and it was a GEX rebuild (previous 
owner put that in).

I've really only put maybe 500 miles on the bus in the past 5 years I've 
owned it... but that's because I've been going through an entire restore 
with it.

The motor has all of it's tin work now (didn't before), it's got the flaps 
installed, with the spring. There is no thermostat though. It has the air 
cooler, and the proper foam insulator for the engine compartment. It has new 
lifters (the GEX ones went bad and it would take 10 minutes for them to pump 
up). I ended up getting new Febi (whichever are the expensive ones) and 
they're great. I can literally go a month without starting the Bus, and it 
immediately starts up and the lifters are pumped within 2 seconds... 
sometimes they're already pumped up.

It runs really well... it's just that it feels like maybe it's running too 
warm.

I put a VDO CHT gauge on it a couple of years ago, and it didn't do 
anything. As a matter of fact, it was such a worthless gauge that it didn't 
even read anything when I put the lead into a pot of boiling water. Is there 
a better way to check the temperature of the Bus? Maybe an oil temperature 
gauge? I wish there was a port or something I could screw one into. I'd 
REALLY like to be able to tell how my Bus is running. I also wish I had an 
O2 gauge, but I've since installed a factory 73 exhaust.

I hope you don't mind, but I CC'ed the list in case someone else has any 
thoughts...


And yeah, that is the fan I'm talking about. I could swear that it said it 
was for all years of "Type-2" VW Bus.


Thanks Jamie...

Todd
