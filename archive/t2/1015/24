Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Heated Seats

James,
   
  I've installed them not in a bus but same difference.  I installed some in my mothers CRV when she bought it using a set of elements from an Audi 200 I had around.  Pretty easy install and freeish to me as I had 3 junker Audi's around.  Easy enough to go to a good you pull it yard and take what you need controls and elements for not much.  Worth bringing a multimeter to ensure the elements aren't open (pretty common that a wire in them breaks.  The factory VW/Audi element is just in a cloth mat that you tuck over the foam (or in this case horsehair) and under the upholstery.  Could always dream of finding a Vanagon equipped factory seat and just putting it in, but I've only seen about 2 in my life, more common in Europe, not so much here.  Any VW/Audi set will be about the right size though, grab the controls, the wiring you can probably figure out, the 200 sets I used had no relays.  Most VW/Audi have elements in the seat and backrest, in a you pull it yard without
 supervision, I'd just cut open the upholstery well off to the sides and pull out the elements.  Audi's are great sources as a lot of 4000/5000/80/90/100/200s are worthless in yards with blown trannies and many have heated seats.  Late model VW's often do as well though.  However I don't think $90 a seat for a new set is bad, Audi usually wants $100-200 just for one element

  I want to make the seats in my '77 Westy electrically heated, has anybody done this? How did you do it? How much did you spend?
