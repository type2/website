Subject: Re: [T2] small portable toilet to fit between bay window front

Seems to me that you'd have to have a mighty tiny posterior to sandwich 
it in between the seats...

I can highly recommend a Thetford:

The higher end models are taller, have a larger capacity and a battery 
powered flush pump, which is nice.  But I'm pretty sure that even the 
smallest one, which I have, wouldn't fit in between the seats...

I put mine centered behind the walkthru when camping in my '79 westy. 
Leaves enuf room to open the cabinets...
