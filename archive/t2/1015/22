Answer:  Buy the seals that fit...  Don't be misled by some vendor saying
their seals are OEM VW or European made, and not Brazilian and not India and
not Thailand (I got a windshield installed, and the glass shop used a seal
from Thailand.  It was a fine seal, big and fat and covering some of the
lower ridge.)

I got FOUR 3/4 window seals from  vendor XYZ over a year ago.  When I got
them, I took just one seal out of the plastic wrap and it looked fine.

Then just a month ago, Mark Dearing  'informed' me that the window seals
from Vendor XYZ are 'not up to his standards'

So I grabbed a 3/4 window glass and the 3/4 window seal and 'what the hey !
! !'  . . . .I could NOT get the glass to fit in the groove of the seal!!
The seal was tighter than a 16 year old v!rg3n's whatch-a-ma-call-it...


I feel confident that I will overcome the trials and eventually get the
glass into the seal's groove.  I will succeed where Bob's people gave
up!!  Where
Mark Dearing gave up !!!!!   It may take 3 people and a heat gun and liquid
silicone and lots of patience...

But why go through that trouble if you can get a 3/4 window seal that WORKS
and is only a few bucks ($4) more than Vendor XYZ's !!  I already have FOUR,
so I don't think I can emotionally accept that I screwed up by not trying
the seals as soon after I received them as possible.  Vendor XYZ has a
published return policy, and I am way out of the time-line window for a
return.

Besides, these seals from Vendor XYZ should not be fostered off on another
aficionado,  (But, hey, if you want to buy the 3/4 seals that I have, I can
sell them to you for $15 plus actual shipping cost.  Brand new, never
installed (obviously), and I can probably get some more from Mark and Bob
and anyone else who got Vendor XYZ seals)

I got a nice new German windshield rubber and side rubber from one
of the major suppliers on this list....  I learned a whole lot of new
4 letter words getting the side window in and the folks from the
windshield shop took 3 guys and 4 hours and never did get the new
rubber pulled on, they finally reused the old rubber and it went on in
minutes.
