Subject: FI Wiring harness

hey folks, I've searched the archives on this one already and can't find what I think I'm looking for.  
   
  My 74 single cab  with 1700 CB engine code  (with 78 FI) has an occasional hiccup when driving at highway speeds.  At idle, when i go back to the engine compartment and shake the the FI harness, it will cut out and stall from time to time.  It seems as if there is an intermittant break in the FI harness somewhere.  I seem to rememember discussion here of some company which makes or rebuilds FI harnesses for these beasts.  Did i just dream this?  If anyone can steer me in the direction I should go, I'd be very appreciative.  Greg T.
