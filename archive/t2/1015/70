Greg,

I had the same thing going on with my '79. Drove me crazy. One day
while I had my head in the engine compartment, I moved the harness
near the AFM. Pulled the plug, and lo and behold one of the individual
female spade connectors within the plug had backed out of the plug and
was making intermittent contact. I pulled it all the way out, bent up
the little retaining tab that holds in in the plug, and presto, no
more intermittent hiccups.

Try very carefully to move one plug on the harness at a time to
isolate the problem. If that doesn't work, pull the plugs one at a
time and check 'em for recessed connectors.
