well.. you should try to get the VDo to work... hopefully you can work some
boiling water in a pot into the area where the lead reaches now.. so you
don't have to take the wiring out of the bus,,,

make sure the wires are plugged in all the way.. I would clamp the spark
plug ring to a big nut or steel plate... small enough to fit in your pot of
hot water....  and see if it goes up scale..

if that doesn't work.. you might have one of the gauges with the wiring
backwards....  you can pull the pins out of the harness plug,, and reverse
them,, then the gauge should go up scale...  iirc

go here, read this,, look for Dakota Digital on that page..
