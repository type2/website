Subject: harmonic balancer (curiousity question)

On another forum (Saab), this statement was made during
a discussion of "harmonic balancers"

> The damper itself is the large metal mass on the end of the

Assuming for the moment that the above statement is
true, I'd guess that as the Type 2 does not have its
cylinders all in a straight line that such comments
as those above have no meaning here.

Education is good,
