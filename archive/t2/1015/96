Heh-heh, it seems people think I want to USE the portapotty while it's 
between the seats, but I don't. It's just a handy place for it, as it would 
double as a small table while parked there. :-) I think there would be 
enough room in my 77 Westy to slide it back a bit and have it there if the 
bed is down? Anyone else put it at the end of the bed like that, on the 
floor? Is it useable there without being a contortionist? :-b
