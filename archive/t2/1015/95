I like my Thetford too.  If you're buying a new one get the marine
version.  They cost a bit more, but are made of better materials and will
last longer.

It appears that the 135 model will just barely fit between the seats in a
Bay, but with only about 3/4 of an inch to spare.  The question remains
whether you will be able to use your seatbelts with the toilet in place.
