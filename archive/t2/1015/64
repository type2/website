At least it looks A LOT better than Chrysler's current offering which looks
like a very poor knock-off of the Honda Odyssey. I can't believe VW didn't
demand an independent rear suspension! Visions of 1st generation Jettas
dance through my head. I wonder if you throw it into a tight corner like an
original GTI, will it cock a rear wheel in the air?
