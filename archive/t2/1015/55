Subject: Re: [T2] small portable toilet to fit between bay window front

The Paka-Potti (Sears) we got YEARS ago fits perfectly between the front 
seats or the gap between the rear sink cabinet and the bedseat. We made 
a cover from the blue-green material of the seats.  I cut a 1/4" plywood 
board and glued it to the plastic seat cover to strenghen it so one 
could walk/sit on it. If you flatten the tire cover into a hinged door 
as we did, thaen it will also fit where you see the garbage stool.

  Does anyone have a brand name and size for a proper small toilet (not 
the bucket type)
that has a small holding tank and pump handle that would fit between the 
front seats in
  a 77 Westy camper? That way it would double as a small table
(yes with the lid down, otherwise it would be a drink holder) :-b
Price would be good and where you got it as well!
