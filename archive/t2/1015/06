Subject: Bus Gift Items & Gift Certificates

Just a note that I have updated our Gifts page, for those of you working on
your wish list for Santa. Among other things, we have a limited number of
special-edition Haynes products from England featuring a cutaway of a VW Bus
- items like playing cards, glasses and coasters, wallets, etc.  

Go to:

http://busdepot.com/catalog.jsp?model=57&category=46

Then click on the various subcategories, such as "T-shirts,"  "Wallets & Key
Rings," and the catch-all, "Toys, Games, Gifts, Posters, Calendars, & More."


Our gift certificates (also linked from the above page) are a very popular
item as well.  (Beats asking for a fuel pump for Christmas, if that's what
you really need. :-)
