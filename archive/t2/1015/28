Hi Mark,

You gotta be careful about that... I've been told that too short a  
pipe will potentially expose the valves to cold air and damage  
them... But I agree, Troy's setup looks pretty good.

This setup has ben working for me; but they are very loud. I've run  
them twice now, and always wind up going back to the 72-74 setup  
after a month or so.
