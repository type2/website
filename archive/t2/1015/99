Subject: Aux Heaters... bn4?

Hey everyone.. im on my 6th bus :D but anyways.. I live in Utah.. COLD right
now.. First big snow.. the heat "ducting" the po had under there fell off
and i froze to death.. then froze some more replacing parts with the Black
ABS pipe, Heck i even found a reducer that fin in the back where the Y comes
to a point and heads up towards the front and then slip jointed the other
end.. blows way more air now.. and if i threw a curtain there it might get
warm.. but i have kids.. they need to be warm too lol. any ideas on where to
get an inexpensive BN4 heater??? My old bus had this crazy furnace with a
thermostat and everythign and u could drive with teh furnace on.. i just
dont remember if it was a hyrdoflame or what anymore.. any ideas on gettin
the Westy warm?? oh.. its a 72 with a 2.0 in it.

Cheers!
             Jason
