Subject: Engine smoothness.

The Suby engines must be an order of magnitude smoother than any of the VW 
engines I've had. Some of my engines have been smoother than others. All had 
their internal components balanced. Anyone know what might account for 
smoothness differences? My current engine is a bit of a shaker even with a 
counter-balanced crank, a first for me. Its a bit disappointing.

Smoothness is the characteristic of a flat configured engine.
The firing order is set in such a way that 2 cylinders fire about the
same time in the oppositie direction.  Thus balancing out the resultant 
forces.

It is simply due to this reason that VW aircooled engines
lived such long lives. The force on main bearing is reduce
considerably. Resulting in less than normal wear.

I commend subaru for staying with the flat configuration.
Beside saving space, the are smooth and last longer.
