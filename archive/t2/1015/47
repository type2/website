Subject: What size?

When I removed my exhaust manifolds, I broke 2 of the studs that hold the
manifolds to the heads. I took one of the studs that screwed itself out with
me to reference at Napa. The guy at Napa who is an old Porsche guy could NOT
get the size of the stud! All he could confirm is that the end that holds
the manifold snug is an 8mm, but he could not get a size for the end that
screws in to the head. He said it was too big for an 8 and too small for a
10... anyone got an idea of what size this would be and if there is a FLAPS
that I would be able to find it at?

Mucho Mahalos!
