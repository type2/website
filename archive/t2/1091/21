Volks,

Thanks again for all who participated and contributed to make this
event a success.

Some pictures are already uploaded to our gallery with more
to come.

Check out the slideshow at:

Everything
went like clockwork with a great turn out of 87 VW vehicles at the campout. 
Everyone was well fed with the "Breakfast Burritos" and the pot-luck was a big
success as well.

The rain came but did not scare 25 vans from going to the
race tracks on Sunday. 


If you have any pictures from this event that you
wish to share, please forward them to me or I can give you instructions for
uploading them yourself.
 
 
Thank you,
 
Joel Cort
