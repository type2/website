Hi Mike,
	It would be really cool if we could adjust the mixture and timing  
while driving on the road in our older carbed VWs and watch head  
temps and even CO and HC.  I know that modern fuel injected vehicles  
just do this automatically. I learned to fly in Michigan and we never  
talked too much about mixture, other than maybe pull it out a bit  
once at cruising altitude.  That was usually not much more than  
3,000' above sea level.  I now live at near 3,000' and I often cruise  
at 6,000' in my VWs.  I suppose that our VWs are simple like fixed  
prop planes where hitting the gas increases the manifold pressure and  
off you go!
Gary
