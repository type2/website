Altitude shouldn't affect the tuning process much other than needing to 
lean out the mixture (air has less oxygen at altitude so it requires 
less gas).

As far as adjusting air/fuel ratio, yes, you can change it.  In carbs, 
you change the jets and on the L-Jet you adjust the spring tension.  Or 
you get a megasquirt and command the exact AFR that you desire.

As for changing manifold pressure, you can also change that too... just 
step on the gas :)
