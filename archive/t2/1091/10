Mike,
	It can also be caused by erratic spark, or excessively advanced timing, 
probably other things too.  I know you probably don't have those 
problems either, but I just wanted to point out that pinging IS possible 
without excessive heat or compression.

I would also think about the possibility that low overall CHT might not 
be a safe indicator that nothing dangerous is going on in the combustion 
chamber.

And while I can't argue with your results, I keep asking myself why, if 
it is possible to run so lean/cool/efficiently, didn't VW design its 
engines to run this way?  Could it be that NOx emissions go through the 
roof?
