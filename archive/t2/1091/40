Subject: '79 Westy wiring

Good morning all,

I bought a '79 parts bus over the weekend. I want to take the wiring, the
heating piping, may be the front end and some body panels out of it for my
'78.

Is the wiring for a '79 bay window the same on a '78 Westy Champagne
Edition? I am pulling the wiring out of the '79 and installing it into the
'78. 
Also, are the heating vents underneath the same. I am considering
reinstalling the heater that came with the '78.

Thanks for any advice.

Bob
