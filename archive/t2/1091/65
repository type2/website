Subject: Getting the '73 running (diagnostic advice needed!)

Volks,

I am (OK, Tom Tarka is) trying to get my 1973 bus running.  This bus has a
1978 FI system installed, and should be thought of as a '78 for diagnostic
purposes.  The symptoms and diagnostic we have followed  are as follows:

Dwell and timing are good, coil is producing spark.
All vacuum lines are connected

NB: the double relay is  defective, and the gas pump runs whenever the
ignition is on
when the ignition is turned on, gasoline pressure rises *slowly* to 40psi
(about 5 seconds)
when cranked after a 1-2 minute rest period, the engine will fire up for a
second or two, then die.
further attempts at starting do nothing until the bus has rested for a
minute or two.

Anyone have any suggestions?  We replaced the fuel filter without affecting
the slow rise in fuel pressure, we have a goodused gas pump courtesy of
Barry Burneskis and installing that is the next step, but it's time to ask
the list for ideas.  Got any?

TIA,

Steve Dolan
