I wish I knew what is going on in your engine, and I wish I was an
automotive engineer with studies at my fingertips.

First, the chemical reaction will burn the exhaust valves.

I don't know if there are other localized hot spots that will damage
the engine at the AFRs you are running at.

Pinging is another danger. If your bus is sound insulated you won't hear it.

I guess your engine can be the experiment. See how long it last and
what you learn on the autopsy.

I don't know who started this trend on Samba, but it goes against all
industry practices, and I just have the feeling that a lot of people
are going to ruin motors by following this trend.
