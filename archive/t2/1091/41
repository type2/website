Thanks Jamie, 

This puts my mind at ease a bit. Did VW add a propane heater between and
just aft of the front seats? There in one in the '79.

Bob.. I have never tried to interchange the harness.. but unless I am
mistake,, the VW harness is the same,

now.. the differences might be,, the gas heater wiring,, and the Westfalia
wiring....

depending on the gas heater style...

and.. Westfalia added one wire I think in 79...   to bring power from the
front fuse panel to the sink pump..  and also for the aux battery and
charger. if equipped..........

all I can think of.
