Hi Mike,

Thanks for the suggestion. I sent John an email to keep it off the
forum. I'll let you know what he says.

I skimmed the entire thread. I see he is the primary source of information.

It seems he has a lot of experience using tuning instruments and jets.

I am concerned that he says 410F is not excessive CHT.

If his primary experience is performance tuning, he may be working
with engines that never last long enough to see the consequences of
his tuning for daily drivers.

The chemical reaction is oxygen plus iron yields iron oxide. This is
the process that burns valves and pits valve seats.

I had pinging on a bus that was too lean. I didn't know what the
problem was until I discovered that the previous owner had built it up
to oversize so that the stock jets were too lean. After richening the
mixture the pinging stopped.

John
