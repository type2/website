Subject: RE: [T2] '69 issues....and questions on front and rear end

I'll start with the clutch cable.  You should replace the tube where it's
split, you might be able to use a compression fitting.

Boden tube should be a flat s shape, maybe PO installed a bug tube, dont
know.



Upper mount will have to be welded.  I'd go to a welding shop and not a
mechanic, usually get a better job.



Replace all four cv boots, not too hard, Ratwell probably has a how-to.



I'd adjust the beam untill you are level and call it good, disk brakes are a
good thing.  To raise the rear end you will need to re-clock or re-set the
torsion bars.  Not an easy thing, but if you do replace the bushings (I prefer
urethane) at the same time.



Ball joints- jack the front end up and put on stands.  Grab tire at 12 and 6
oclock and try and rattle.  If it moves, see where it's moving, if it's ball
joints, replace, your mechanic should be capable of this.  If not, see if you
can get some boots and replace them.  While you're at it, grab tire at 3 and 9
oclock and see if it rattles, and where, this is usually the tie rod ends.
Replace if necessary.



And no, they did not put zerks on the ball joints, damnit.
