Hiya All,

Recently there have been a few questions as to the nature of the VW wrecking
yard spotted on the southern fringes of Yreka, CA just off I-5.  I had to
deliver my daughter to college in southern California and decided to 
stop in Yreka
and find out about this possible source for parts.

Turns out the wrecking yard is run by Garcia's Foreign Car Clinic.  23 Buses
in the yard of which 6 were splitties.  Overall, I was impressed by the care
of the vehicles.  Clean yard.  I found a pair of early bay front turn signal
housings in very (VERY) good shape.  And, unless you've had to look for these
things, you won't know how hard a pair of really good ones are to 
find.  $10.00
apiece including the lenses and rubber seals.  Lots of other cars there too.
Mostly Bugs, but there was a 412 also.

Definitely worth stopping in and looking around.  Info:  2035 Fairlane Rd.,
530.842.5516, generally open on weekdays - closed on the weekends.

AND..........if that weren't enough, Serf (the fellow I talked to at Garcia'
s) told me about another place in Corning, CA.  So, since we were headed south
on I-5 we kept a lookout for this one also.  We found Reilly's Mufflers at
2351 Carona Ave., 530.824.4086.  Bill (?) is an old hand at VWs and 
although he
runs a muffler shop his first love is VWs.  He also has a wrecking yard - not
as extensive as Garcias.  But he has a beautiful shop setup and lotsa 
VW parts.
  Great guy to talk to.  When we were there he was trying to peddle a
customer's 68 single cab.  Very clean, complete, and no 
rust.  Customer wanted $5,500
for it but Bill thought it should go for $4,500.

If you're planning on traveling I-5 yet this summer, give these two a
look-see.  I had a great time at both places.
