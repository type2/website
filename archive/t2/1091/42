Subject: RE: [T2] distributor lubrication

Yeah, the other local bus pilot around here had bought a tube of Bosch dist
grease a couple years back, and told me if I ever need any, to let him know
cause he has 99.5% of the tube left after using some for his distributor. So
I gave him a ring and he gave me some.  Probably enough to last my lifetime.
I really have ignored the inner workings of the distributor up till now, but
I am so glad I took the plunge and cleaned and re-greased everything in
there.  It was seriously crusty grease and sticky.  It has to help the
engine run better.

Anyhoo, thanks for the help!

Hello Mark, If you do a web search on the word "Bosch" or "grease" and
their part number, you might find a cheaper souce. Timo
