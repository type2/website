Subject: Bus Boneyard, shop in Yreka, CA?

Just wondering, passed a shop/yard/who knows what on the marathon drive from
Sacramento back up to Palmer AK over the last 4 days.  Blew past its exit and
by the time I got to the next exit, it was under construction, and the wife
wasn't really that interested in doubling back.  Checking out the google
sattelite images, looks to be on S Foothill Drive in Yreka CA, right on I5. 
Had probably 30-50 buses and vanagons of various years sitting there, and
other VWs (the sattelite pic shows about that many.)  If it isn't owned by an
idiot (common of course now days) might be a treasure trove for someone.  Heck
maybe it is one of us here's shop?
 
Anyway, would have emailed someone there in Coos Bay who probably would have
know, but of course.....   8-(
 
Well anyone in way north CA looking for a bus, sure looked to be the place.
