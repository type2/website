This is a shot in the dark, but could it be a defective fuel regulator? My
other though is, Is the injector signal wire hooked to the coil? I had this
problem when I first installed fuel injection in my bus. The cold start valve
would pump just enough gas into the plenum for it to fire a couple of times,
but not enough for it to run.
 
Good Luck,

when cranked after a 1-2 minute rest period, the engine will fire up for a
second or two, then die.
further attempts at starting do nothing until the bus has rested for a
minute or two.
