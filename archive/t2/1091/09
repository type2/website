I'm still curious what you mean by chemical reaction.  Are you 
suggesting that the the lean burning gas creating an acid (or something 
analogous to acid) that's burning the valves?  That's the only thing it 
could be because the head temps are staying lower than 400, above which 
is where heat damage starts to happen.

Whether it's pinging or predetonation or whatever you want to call it, 
that would require excessive heat and/or excessive compression, both of 
which I do not have.

You might try replying to that thread and see why John is saying the 
things he does.  He's quite knowledgeable in regards to engine tuning.
