Hello Nick, there is a special spring that has a narrower loop that fits
into the notch on the rod. The spring then presses lightly on that
"loop" on the back of the pedal to keep the rod from falling out.
Regarding your vacuum leak: That tube that goes around the left of the
engine from the manifold under the carb is the vacuum hose for the brake
booster. There are a few short sections of rubber hose, with a one way
plastic valve in them, going to a metal tube in the body in the rear of
the car and then one from that metal tube to the booster itself in the
front. Replace those rubber hoses, that's most likely the source of your
leak. Hope this helps, Timo
