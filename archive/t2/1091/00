That's correct David. 60 years of experience with air-cooled VW
engines have shown that lean mixtures damage engines. Engines of all
types suffer damage from lean mixtures, but the VW engine is more
sensitive since air-cooling causes the metals to run close to their
tolerance limits already.

The push by smog control regulations to move the mixtures from the
comfort zones of 11-13 towards stoichiometry is what put VW out of the
air-cooled business. Brazil held out the longest, but with the passage
of Brazil's recent smog control law, even the currently manufactured
Brazilian Type 2 buses were forced to switch to a water-cooled engine.

The confusion comes from a chart on the Samba that Mike has been
looking at which graphs dropping temperatures at leaner mixtures. If
you go far enough lean, there is less fuel, so it becomes something
like a fading campfire that won't keep you warm any more. But at the
lean mixtures near stoichiometry the excess oxygen fuels the fire like
an oxy-acetylene torch, which is why this type of torch is so much
hotter than a propane torch. This is what destroys engines.

 If you disagree, please explain your reasoning.
