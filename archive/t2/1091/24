eh, double long,  is kewl.


went up to "Buses by the Trax" today (bummer that two mid atlantic
meets are the same day, can't be in PA and MD at the same time) sure
wish Ron would reschedule his in the future, Buses by the Trax date is
always first weekend in Oct and the date is set by the town of
Brunswick little wiggle room.

in any case a small but intense group made it (Two in "T*y*t*'s for
shame) and the SC was really nice..  will have some photos as soon as
I download them, unfortunately something came up and I had to leave
before Sharon's fantastic chicken soup and stew was ready..
