Me 3.  If it were my bus I'd remove the plates and readjust the front end.
Some people think the "low surfer bus thing" is cool, but to me one of the
best features of a bus is it can travel over rough roads without ground
clearance problems...  Living now part of the year on a rutted gravel road
drove this home to me recently!

In fact, I had mine bumped up, I think it was
a tooth or 2 (don't remember now, as it's been a while!) because after hauling
all that westy stuff and the 2l motor for the dozen and a half 10000 miles it
had on it it had "saggyosis" really bad, and when I put my living gear in it
and put the utility trailer on the back it was really way too low.  As I
remember, it was a little tricky but nothing one couldn't accomplish using
considerable due caution...  after watching it done I realized it was
something I really *could* do if I really, really had to.  

My 2"...

I agree. Take
out the adapters.

I have asked my mechanic to remove these adaptor

know originally the thoughts were to just leave it, as
adjusting the rear
end is tricky, but now that I see it is apparently just
these adaptor
plates, it doesn't look too tricky.

Any thoughts about these
adaptor plates? Or suggestions appreciated.
