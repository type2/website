Subject: Question about "dizzy' ..'twin ports', on '74 1.8 L motor

I have installed the Petronix setup in my stock 1974 Dizzy, but since I am
running Del 34s, where do the 2 .."hookups', for , I suppose vacuum advance on
the dizzy , attach to the carbs?  There are 2  or 3 orofices, off of the
carbs, and I would presume..closer to throttle base plate..better?  Cheers
