Hi Steve,

40 psi is too high. Check the return line for kinks or blockages.

Cough and die is typical behaviour for a vacuum leak; check all hoses 
for cracks and false connections.

Also try starting it with the AFM disconnected. It should start and idle 
if everything else is OK; though it won't respond to throttle input 
unless it applied very very gently.

BTW, did you ever sell that auto-stick beetle?


Happy Trails,
