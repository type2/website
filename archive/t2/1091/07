That brings up another question... do the carbs have the stock sized 
venturis?  If they are larger, that would explain the lean running.  I 
don't think they are easy to replace in the stock carbs, but perhaps 
someone enlarged them?

Does anyone know the stock venturi diameter for the 32-34 PDSIT carbs? 
I think it is 26mm but I'm not sure anymore.  If nobody knows, I could 
probably pull one out of a box in the attic and measure it.
