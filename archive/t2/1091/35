I use a pair of vice-grip locking pliers to sqeeze the clamp ears until the
clamp expands, then shove the whole assembly down and release the pliers. 
Make sure when you shove it home that it seats correctly.  There are two
"tangs" in the plastic funnel that line up with two indentions in the metal
pipe that make if fit in a certain orientation.
