Hello Mark, Bosch makes special grease for the advance unit shaft "Ft 1v
26" for BMW or "5 700 005 005" and the felt and pivots "Ft 1 v 26" for
BMW or 5 700 002 005. These are used on points ignition BMW motorcycles
and are available from http://www.CapitalCycle.com at about $9 each for
a 45ml tube. The felt under the rotor inside the shaft gets a few drops
f engine oil. Hope this helps, Timo in Hawaii
