Subject: Busaru for sale details

I now have some more details about my Busaru and all the stuff bundled with it - photos, etcetera. If interested, send me an e-mail OFF THE LIST and I'll send you more details. BTW - if you're a praying sort, please channel some positive energy my way - I'll need all I can get. (Legal trouble - not sick!)
Thank you all for your support over the years. It's been a great ride! -BaH
