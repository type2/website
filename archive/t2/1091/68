My thanks to Bob, Mr. Potts, Mr. Thompson, and Airic.  Jiggling the
connector on the AFM turned a non-starting bus into a starting and running
smooth bus.  I love 30+-year-old electrics :-(

Interestingly, once the RPMs got up to 1500-2000, the fuel pressure dropped
to 32, right where it ought to be.  I know the fault in the double relay is
a hazard, but I've tried a couple times to diagnose and cure it without
success and I frankly gave up a decade ago.  It runs fine that way and at
this point, I don't even worry about it.
