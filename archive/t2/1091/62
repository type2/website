Subject: My Busaru is For Sale

Is anyone interested / know anyone who may be interested - in the Seattle area? My daily driver Subaru powered '79; complete replacement body (the current one is rusting pretty badly, but still very presentable), spare Subaru 2.2 engine for rebuilding, Espar heater capable of maintaining 80 degrees inside when the outside is sub-zero! Set of 4 mounted Nokian Hakkapallittas with only 2 winters on them (virtually new.) 1000 Watt inverter hard-wired in... All the accumulated spares and stuff...

It's kind of an urgent situation, so if you have any interest, don't hesitate to p-mail me.
