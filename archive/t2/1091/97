If you have 2 hose connectors on your dizzy, the one on the inside,
closest to the body is for retard, and the outer one is for advance.
The retard signal is generally not recommended as it is an artifact of
something VW did for emissions qualification and retards idle timing
to 10 ATDC.

The advance line goes to the carb vacuum port, as you said, the lower
one near the throttle plate.
