Subject: How to cut body panels

Hi All, 

I bought a '79 parts bus, and want to get some guidance on how to cut out
the body parts I need. I need the nose from just under the vent to 5 inches
below where the spare tire is mounted. I need the passenger side floor and
about 8 inches of cargo bay floor just behind the front seats. Should I
remove the entire floor take what I need and offer the rest to the local bus
population or just cut out what I need and leave the rest for someone else.
What is the best tool to use for cutting besides a plasma cutter. I have a
4.5 grinder and some pneumatic tools. I'm offering what ever I don't need to
the local bus population. The rear hatches are in pretty good shape. There
is no engine, transmission, or CV joints in it, but the dashboard, steering
wheel, and front belly pan are in good shape.

Any ideas? 

Bob
