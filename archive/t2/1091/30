Subject: 72 Turn signal

Hi all,
I have a 72 bus and my turn signal is broken.  I can signal to the
left, but it won't go up to signal for right turns.  I have been
unable to find a replacement signal.

It was recommended by BustedBus.com to get a signal for a 71 bus.
Here is the quote from Chris, "The 72 switch has less wires. It has
one signal wire for each SIDE whereas the 68-71 switch has a wire for
each corner (2 for each side) Knowing that, you should now
understand....on the 68-71 switch, splice the 2 of each side into 1."

Has anyone ever tried this?  Will it work?  There are plenty of 68-71
signals available at all of the usual places.  Anyone know where I can
get one for a 72?

thanks as always,

Rob Garretson b.
