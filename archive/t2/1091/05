This statement still boggles me.  Is it a chemical reaction that's 
hurting the engine or the heat?  Because my engine runs cooler at 
leaner-than-stoich mixtures than when it's running at stoich.  So, 
unless there is a harmful chemical reaction that's eating the cylinders 
with my cooler-than-stoich temps, running leaner than stoich is not a 
problem.

But it does keep the flame hot enough while running cool at the same 
time.  I can run at a 16-18:1 ratio and it runs much cooler than at 
stoich, and I'm going 70MPH.  So, not only am I saving fuel, but I'm 
running cool, too.  To take it a step further, that samba thread 
recommends advancing the timing because a leaner mixture takes longer to 
burn, but I haven't gotten around to doing that yet.
