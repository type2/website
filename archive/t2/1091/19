Good answers, James. Just a couple of small points....

>  I'd adjust the beam untill you are level and call it good

Bus should be a little high at the front, not level. It should be
level when driver is seated. IIRC Ratwell has a photo on this.

I've heard a good way to do this is to put a lever, like a pry bar,
between the tire and the ground and check for vertical movement this
way.

They thought that putting boots on it would eliminate the need. I
don't know what they thought you were supposed to do when the boots
fail. That's one thing I like about the older buses - more zerks!
