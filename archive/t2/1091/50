Subject: Solex Rejetting - Round 2

Hi all,
first, I want to thank everybody for their help concerning my lean and
hot running bus. Today, I talked to the engine builder (Kummetat, the
company that rebuilt my AMC heads). He wants me to drive to his shop and
to make tests on his dynamometer - something I'll be definitely doing
once I get the engine to perform without approaching a CHT of 400F most
of the time. Therefore he confirmed me in putting in bigger jets (140
mains). He's also sending me some smaller air correction (150) and
bigger idle jets (55). What I did not know is that the cutoff valves on
the standard Solex carbs also have different sizes (52 and 55). I'm
going to look through my spare carb parts to see if I can find two 55's.
Concerning the lean/rich thread: Since there seems to be consensus on
the fact that even more important than CHT is EGT, who has installed
such sensors and what are the temperatures that one should expect?
Looking at EGT probes (e.g. here http://tinyurl.com/y8llroa ), they seem
to be fairly cheap and could be installed into the heat exchangers right
below the cylinder head by just drilling a small hole. Of course one has
to route the sensor wires (Type K thermocouple) all the way up to the
dash and find a gauge that ideally can be connected to 4 probes. I'm
already far beyond the common instrumentation level (oil temp, rpm, CHT,
AFR), so I just won't care dropping in some more gauges if this can
confirm me in running a healthy engine... So, does anybody have any
experience with EGT probes?
Thanks for all your help, it's greatly appreciated!
Timo
