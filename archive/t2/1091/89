Subject: front and rear end

Just an update here.with maybe a question or two.

I have the bus up on the lift, they have welded the upper shock mount on the
rear side. It looks like a nice job. I have also had all 4 CV joints
re-done. I had asked you guys previously about the bus appearing to be too
low. Apparently the PO put some sort of adaptor on the rear end to lower the
rear, as well as the new front end(with disc brakes) which is adjustable. So
the bus was always low, which I did not particularly like, and I think this
also made the ride a bit stiffer.

I have asked my mechanic to remove these adaptor plates to bring the bus
back up to stock height, and then to adjust the front beam accordingly. I
know originally the thoughts were to just leave it, as adjusting the rear
end is tricky, but now that I see it is apparently just these adaptor
plates, it doesn't look too tricky.

Any thoughts about these adaptor plates? Or suggestions appreciated.

Thanks,

-Kevin
