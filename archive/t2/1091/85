I think that the learning curve has actually flattened with EFI.  Reading 
the SDS manual they make it crystal clear what parameter affects what. 
Instead of worrying about the byzantine interaction of main, air 
bleed, idle, etc.  With EFI you just pick how much gas to inject for a 
given RPM then pick multipliers for manifold pressure, temperature, etc. 
It's like having a giant box of jets right there!  In fact, with the SDS 
system you have a "rich/lean" knob in front of you so you can tweak the 
system to see the effect before making changes to the programming!
