Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal Question

Thanks to all that replied.  That was indeed the back of the emergency flasher
switch.  I removed the switch, snapped everything back in place, zip tied it,
and reinstalled.  And now I have turn signals!  Big, big thanks to Chris at
BustedBus for all his help in making sure I had all the parts and pieces of
the switch's innards.

BUT, the emergency flashers don't work.  When I pull the switch out the turn
signal indicator on the dash lights up but there's no blinky blinky and
nothing going on outside.  I understand that the turn signals and the
emergency flashers use the same relay so what would cause one to work and the
other not?

And, last question, I have one wire coming off the back of that switch that
doesn't attach to anything.  It looks like it might go to the radio, does the
radio's power run through that switch as well?  And yes I have a wiring
diagram but no I don't know how to read it.

Thanks again!

  looks like the back of a headlight switch, or emergency flasher switch. Time
for a new one, which ever it is, because the springs are probably lost.
