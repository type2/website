Subject: Re: [T2] Look what I found inside my engine

Yeah, I was given a free bus with a Porsche engine with a bad left
head. So I got the new head, fired up the bus only to hear a horrible
hammering sound. Shut it down, pull the right head and find a screw
hammered into the piston. Figured it dropped in the open spark plug
hole due to the poor housekeeping of the previous owner - all kinds of
stuff on the engine deck when I got the bus....

 The engine that I took out of my bus, that the DPO had rebuilt, was the

 Lots 'o shrapnel in the taco plate.
