Subject: Re: [T2] Look what I found inside my engine

I don't know if it's just me, or does that look like the end of a conrod
bolt to anybody else also?  

I know the feeling of finding something rattling around in an engine.
In the time I've been working on engines, from weed-eaters up to V8's,
I've found:

circlips
screws
nuts
distributor spacer washers
Valve retainer clips
A spring
A penny(!!!)
Sheared off timing gear teeth
A thoroughly mangled engine tin screw that caused the sheared timing
gear teeth
A roll pin
Assorted shrapnel from a PO's haphazard repair that failed
A 9/16 socket (!!!!)
Bits of piston skirt
Bits of piston.
Chunks of piston. 
A pop-top can tab
BB's or balls from a ball bearing, yet there were no bearings of that
type in the engine...
Broken off dipper from the crankshaft oil slinger on a Briggs 5HP
Pieces of piston ring
2 cigarette butts
a few of the foil seals from oil cans (several engines)

The engine that I took out of my bus, that the DPO had rebuilt, was the
one that had sheared timing gear teeth and the mangled engine tin screw.
Lots 'o shrapnel in the taco plate.  

Mmmm.. tacos...
