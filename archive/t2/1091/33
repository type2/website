Subject: Oil filler top "thing" install!!!!!!!!!

Hi, I have been ..trying for about 2 hours..to get that "big" ring clip over
the bottom of the oil .."add" conical plastic device..and short of just
glueing the sucker with some kind of ..'super adhesive'..is there a more
tangible method..that does not create that 'ring' bouncing around the garage
floor..and..'hiding'?? Thanks in advance!! Cheers
Syd
