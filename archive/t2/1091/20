Subject: Buses By The Depot - Final Update

Buses By The Depot, and the annual Bus Depot Warehouse Clearance Sale, is
this Saturday, here in PA. See http://www.busdepot.com/BBD2009.htm. As
always, it's free as a day trip or $15 if you spend the night. 

Good news on the weather front - the forecast has improved from eariler
forecasts. Accuweather now calls for intermittent rain in the morning (30%
chance), then gradually clearing in the afternoon, high 72. 

If you reserved a site, you should have received an email from me giving you
a site number. If you did not, please email me right away.

If you did not reserve a site and would like to, I still have a few left.
See the above link to reserve a site for $15 via Paypal.  If you do not
reserve and decide upon arrival that you want to stay the night, you can
find me or Dan Sheridan and give us the $15, assuming there is still space
available among the sites I prepaid for. However if they fill up and you
have to get a site from the camp office instead, it's $35 instead of $15, so
it's safest to reserve. 

If you are just coming for the day, that is free.  But please DO NOT PARK IN
A CAMPSITE. Instead please park in the grassy area in the middle of the loop
(again, see the above link).  The campsites are only for people who have
paid for overnight camping. 

I will be there at noonish on Saturday (my daughter has a school event in
the morning).  Dan Sheridan, the Bus Depot store manager whom many of you
have met, will be swinging by at around 7 this evening to check in on the
folks who are arriving early and camping two nights, and again tomorrow
morning before I arrive.

Looking forward to seeing many familiar faces, and some new ones as well!
