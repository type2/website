Subject: Look what I found inside my engine

I was just taking my 1700 out to clean it a and paint the shroud. The decided
I'd clean up the heads, hone the cylinders and re-ring it for now.
Guess I'll be splitting the case now. This is the second piece like this I've
taken out. About two years ago I was putting a taco plate in from a 914 for a
temp sender and found a piece laying on the plate. Assume someone must have
dropped a valve at one time and all they had done was the head and piston or
pistons. It was laying on the cam when I turned the engine and had 32 out of
the way to look inside.
