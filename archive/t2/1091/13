 I've been following your discussion for a while. I saw something about
"pinging" I have heard that the wrong octane gas could  be the cause of the
pinging.

That question is bothering me too. And it's not just VW engineers.
Mixture tuning is the same in the entire automotive industry. VW engines and
consequently the VW community is just more sensitive to it since air-cooled
engines run so much hotter.
