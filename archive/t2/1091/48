It's funny how far things have come in just the past 4-6 years.  I 
remember asking tons of questions on this list about trying to tweak the 
"black box" L-Jet, and nobody really knew how to do much with it.  Then 
the MegaSquirt came along and that changed things big time.  The 
MegaSquirt really revolutionized the EFI market, and in my eyes, making 
DIY EFI accessible to the general public, and not just those that had a 
few thousand to purchase the higher-priced EFI systems.  Plus, AFR 
meters got into a reasonable price range so that now we can actually 
dial in specific AFRs and really understand what the VW engineers were 
doing.  Granted, it's still a steep learning curve, but it's really neat 
how far things have come in a short time.
