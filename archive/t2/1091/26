Subject: Broken Cable, Chatter, Burnt Clutch?

So I'm rolling into the VW show in Las Vegas this morning, and my clutch
cable snaps - not all the way, it is holding on by a few threads. 
I manage to drive it into the show area and park it, but it is now smelling
like a mutha! I've never smelled a 'burnt clutch' before, but this is what I
imagine it would smell like. 

I install my spare cable there at the show; which draws a bit of interest.
Several hours later I drive it home, and I'm getting considerable clutch
chatter in every gear, and still smelling that smell a bit. 

So did I 'burn' up the clutch? I'm guessing a new one is on my horizon? I
just put this clutch in about 5 months ago.

 

Thanks

Eric
