Subject: 1971 Westy Gas Pedal circlip

Good Evening Everybody,

I'm working on picking up a 71 Westy for either myself or my parents from
MI.  However, the gas pedal steel rod (L shaped) doesn't stay in the loop
that's welded on the back of the pedal.  It feels like there should be some
sort of circlip due to a recessed lip all the way around near the end.



Thanks for the input in advance.


Now to try to figure out where vacuum leaks could come from on a "rebuilt"
motor.  Probably the gas recirculation system that leads off the mainfold
below the carb?


Nick
