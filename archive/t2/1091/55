Subject: Help with Westy tent?

I finally got around to emptying the nice bag that contained the attach westy
tent for my '74.  Wow..it is brand new, clean, poles are all nice and straight
and clean, evrything is there.....except the instructions!  I do not have even
a pix of the assembled tent to go by.  Can someone help?  I have it in the
driveway and want to get it up and then down before weather changes.  Cheers
Syd
