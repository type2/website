Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Turn signal

Hi Rob -

I made a post on this last November 18th 2008, so it's otta be in the
archives somewhere.  But rather than spend countless time trying to find it,
here it is from my own archive:
**********************
Actually, it's pretty simple IF you know the differences between 68-71 and
72 only wiring.  It boils down to this:

Ignore the Black w/Red Stripe, Black w/Yellow Stripe and Grey w/Black Stripe
wires coming from the replacement switch.  These are what operate the Rear
Turn and Stoplight circuits on the 68-71, which were Double Filament Single
Bulbs (1157) for each side.  On 72's the Stoplight circuits run direct from
the Stoplight Switches (rather than thru the Switch on 68-71's) to Single
Filament Bulbs (1156) and the Turn Signal Bulbs (also 1156) run on their own
separate circuits.

On a 72 Bus, simply concern yourself with the Black w/White Stripe (Left)
and Black w/Green Stripe (Right) wires to operate both the front and rear
Turn Signal Bulbs.  The existing connecting block(s) in the harness actually
make this easy for you PROVIDED someone hasn't "butchered" the harnesses
underneath the dashboard.  In addition, the other wires (Black w/Green &
White - to the Hazard Light Switch Terminal 49a) and the Headlight Dimmer
Relay Wires (Brown w/White Strip to the Relay and Brown to Chassis Ground)
are self-explanatory.

It also helps to have a Wiring Diagram ( see http://www.vintagebus.com )
whether replacing with the original, replacement or the make-do I described
above.
*********************
And that's a refresher of that posting.  Take your time, this will work.
