Subject: distributor lubrication

All,

 

2.0L with a 021 905 205P (SVDA) 

I have my distributor tore down to the mechanical advance still on the
shaft, but shaft removed from the distributor body. (Should I just
disassemble mech adv. all the way?) Cleaned all the hardened grease off the
mechanical advance, and it snaps out and back really well now. Before I had
to help it back with my finger. It was gritty, crusty, and probably never
touched since ??? 

After lots of searching, I could not find any definite info on what and
where to properly lube the distributor innards. 

So what does everyone end up using to lube the weights for the mech. adv.
part? Based on the different info I have found in searches, a small drop of
engine oil on the pivot pins of the weights. A touch of distributor grease
on the pads that the weights slide on (under the weights - but this grease
is so sticky, I am hesitant), and then just a couple drops of engine oil on
the felt disk under the rotor. (My felt disk is new, should I saturate it
with clean oil first, squeeze out excess, then install and add 2 drops of
oil?) Then this is what lubes the mech advance tower and the weights down
below, etc from here on, correct? 

Engine oil liberally on lower part of shaft, then assemble in body. 

Then the vac plate (top) to the screwed on plate (bottom), some distributor
grease on the I.D. flanges, where they fit together, some dist. grease on
the ball bearing under the spring clip? 

Then a touch of dist. grease under the point pivot pin (between points and
top plate), drop of oil on the top of the points pivot pin, and a touch of
grease on the lobes for the points block to ride on? 

I apologize for the in depth questions, I just am ready to reassemble
everything and the thick sticky bosch grease seems to defeat the purpose in
some areas, and I cannot find any good complete reference on the subject. 

Thanks in advance.
