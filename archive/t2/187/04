Is it an electrical failure or the starting circuit or a dead battery 
failure? Will it crank and not fire or just not crank?

If the battery is charged then look at the cables. I have seen cases where 
the cables develop a high resistance glaze (for the lack of a better 
technical term) that blocks high current flow. Radio might work barely but 
it won't start. Take everything apart - cables off the battery, clamps off 
of the cables, ground off the frame, hot cable off the starter.

Can you start it by bridging the contacts on the started with a 
screwdriver? (Take the usual precautions - tranny in neutral, helper with 
foot on brake, foot on clutch, lay in line with the vehicle - not legs and 
torso out the side of the vehicle beside the tire which could run over you).

If so then you have a starting circuit failure. You need to see if you are 
getting a full 12 volts in the wire from the key. I don't know the color 
but it should be on the solenoid push on terminal. If you are then I would 
question the condition of the solenoid. Is almost 12 volts enough to trip 
it? Consider the relay hard starting kit AND tearing the solenoid down for 
cleaning and lube. Do the rest of the starter too while you are there. Are 
the starter bushings worn?

Is the hard start related to a hot engine? That has been when I had the 
most trouble with my VW's.

If you aren't getting 12 volts to the solenoid then you have to trace the 
wire back to the key switch. That's where it gets fun but the Bentley 
schematics are good and the same schematics are on the web - I've seen them 
some place. In fact I have a copy on my computer I will send on request.

Let us know what you find.
Ciao!
