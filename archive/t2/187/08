Probably the normal condenser test depending on what type it is.  But if 
it is bad you definately do not want it in the line.  The way this one 
reads as suppression it may be an item that VW put in the lines to lower 
EMF noise.
The disk is a probable unlicensed variant.  I can be gotten through ebay 
in the ebay motors VW area from time to time.  Had some  email words 
with the provider over his ad.  Claimed it would run on mac... NOT you 
will have to load VPC and windoze.

I heard about the ETKA CD on the list quite a bit.  I understand it's
released regularly and newer CDs show more items as NLA.
Can you tell me, what is the software on the CD and where I can obtain an
old copy with more descriptions and less NLA entries?
