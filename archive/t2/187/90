Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum value

Just finished trying to find that  one in 3 different manuals.  All 
basically have the same check for the fuel pressure regulator.  No value 
on the vacuum only on whether it operates within specs when vacuum is 
present.  Same for brake system and for anything else using vacuum.  One 
book had a defined test for checking vacuum at fuel pressure regulator.  
Put thumb over line.  If suction was present vacuum was good.
Now that is what i call a precision check.
