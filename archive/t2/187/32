You have to plug all holes to prevent the pressurized air from leaking out
and not making any pressure.  It is pressure that will move the piston out.
This is a royal pain to do.  The first piston is easy to get out.  The
second requires ingenuity.  When I last did it, the piston shot out and up
like a mortar and came down right on my head.  I ducked and covered, like
the old ad said to do, but it found my head anyway.  Probably better that
way, my head did not ding it as badly as the floor would have.
