Yea,--sure it could have swivel seats.

"IF" it had swivel seats this Van would be a real good find.

But the chances of that happening are more than likely slim.

After looking at two 82 vanagons next to my 82 westy I noted some
differences. The vanagon could have swivel seats installed like the ones
on the westy. If it has the swivel seats you rotate then 90 degrees in
and then release the latches and slide them out. Then the base can be
removed. The swivel mechanism is held down by 4 13mm nuts. If it doesnt
have the swivel you will find that the seat rails are solid seat track
that is part of the body. As for engine stuff I have been finding that
much of the CV engine is unique to 80-83 vanagon/westy. The heads
however list as a 79 - 83 part. jimt

I'm hittin' the road this weekend to visit a friend and an 82 Vanagon he
has on his farm. I'll probably take the front seats home with me for my
79. What tools do I need to remove the front seats? Should I take the
seat tracks and all? 
Also, will the sliding door interior panel from the 82 fit my 79? 
Eventually I plan to drag this van home with me. I have a 78 engine in
my van, could I just take the shortblock from the 82 and put my 78 heads
on it? 
Thanks,
