Hiya List!

Had my carb dialed in on a gas analyzer today.  While I was having that done 
the service advisor mentioned that one of the worst things one could do to an 
AC engine was to run oyxegenated fuel.  The stuff with a percentage of 
alcohol in it.  He says it makes the engine run hotter and actually seems to 
have an "abrasive" (his term) quality which just destroys internals.  

I haven't heard this before.  I searched the archives back a few pages and 
found no direct mention of this situation.  So, what's the deal?  This for 
real?  I'm inclined to take at least some of this on face value.  These folks 
have been in business for 33 years and are recognized as being the best in 
this area.  No question that they do know AC.

The ominous part of all this is that he says most gasolines are blended with 
alcohol in (named Arco specifically) year-round.  Shell and Mobil were also 
mentioned as alcohol adders.  He recommended sticking with either Chevron or 
Texaco.  It seems to me that these two companies DO mix alcohol with their 
petroleum distillate gasoline in the winter months.  Will using it then harm 
the engine?

Just wondering what a consensus of opinion would look like on this topic.
