Yessir, four forward and one reverse. :)  I snagged the shift "knob" 
(actually it extends quite a ways down the shifter rod) off of a Lancia at 
the junkyard.  I liked it because it matched nicely (except for the shift 
pattern of course), and was padded and comfortable.  I only wish I really 
had five forward speeds.  :-)
