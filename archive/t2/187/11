Actually not the same thing, the throttle valve switch on an L-Jet system is
just a simple binary switch that signals the ECU when the driver has applied
full throttle so the mixture can be enriched.

A throttle position sensor more commonly refers to the device on D-Jet
systems which is a variable resistor based on throttle position.  The L-Jet
system has no such device.

Not all the VW Bus L-Jet applications have a throttle valve switch.  I can't
remember if my '79 does or not but I don't think it does.  It varies by
year.

The Chilton's manual for the Bus is pretty much toilet paper.  I've never
found Chiltons manuals to be any good.  The Haynes manual is pretty good but
the big daddy of the manuals is the Official Factory Repair Manual which is
put out by Bentley publishers.  Using that in conjunction with the Haynes is
what you need.
