is a bit frustrated since the pistons seem to be stuck in there pretty
good. He's done caliper rebuilds, but not on anything this old. We've
done the air thing, but it seems just to blow out any fluid that was in
the caliper, not blow out the pistons. Any suggestions? And if you are
going to say do it with a grease gun, where do I get this 'zerk' fitting?

Before getting everything greasy, try this:

Get a small set of channellock pliers, small enough that the head can go
_inside_ the hollow piston.  Stick the head in there, pull the handles
apart, and twist the piston back and forth.  that will usually pop it
right out.
