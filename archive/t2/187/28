Subject: The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems

Does anybody have experience with using the new pertronix ignitor II in the 
009 dizzy?  On their website they say:
"Adjusts spark timing over the entire RPM range to compensate for the 
inherent electronic delay resulting in more stable timing"
Does that mean it intelligently advances or retards the spark as needed, 
thus perhaps solving some of the 009 problems?  Forgive my ignorance if this 
is a dumb question, I know almost nothing about distributors.
