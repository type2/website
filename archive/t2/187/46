  I only wish I really had five forward speeds.  :-)


	You could have them!  Really!  Gene Berg used to sell a kit for a five 
speed that replaced the OEM gear carrier with an aftermarket one.  It had 5 
forward speed gears that used your stock fourth as the fifth gear.  $1K was 
a bit pricey though, and I think they discontinued production based upon 
lackluster sales.
