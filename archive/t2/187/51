Jay,

Be cheap on a lot of things, but *NEVER* on the seal!!!!

Sorry about the yelling(first time ever), but it 
is probably the most important item in your engine compartment.

Go buy one at the local vwflaps.  I paid $20 for my last one.

That seal is what is keeping your engine from absolutely burning up.
It keeps your engine from breathing superheated air straight off of the 
muffler and trying to use it to keep cool with.


Cheers, dave
