Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Steering Box Adjustment

Hal

I used a spring loaded fish weighing scale with hooks on both ends to pull 
on a wrench (the box out of the care). You could probly come close by 
pulling at the end of a spoke of the steering wheel or with a wrench on the 
steering wheel hold down nut(front wheels off the ground). Just multiply the 
length of the lever arm(center to pull point) times the fish scale reading.
