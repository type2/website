That piece of tin is what separates the right cylinder head from the 
alternator.  If you don't have it, there will at a minimum be a lot of 
extra heat getting to your alternator.  Probably other long-term problems 
as well.

Fear not, you are not going to destroy your engine without this piece from 
just starting it and idling it for a few minutes.  Just don't do any long 
interstate cruises until it's replaced.

The pieces S, U, V, and X basically wrap around the edges of the right 
cylinder head.  On the Bus Boys web site, picture the cylinder head between 
these pieces (W is lower, attached to the heat exchanger).

I don't think you will be able to see much of this piece from under the 
engine, except perhaps the small tab that wraps down around the edge of the 
head.

No, you don't have to drop the engine.  You do at a minimum have to remove 
the alternator, and likely also the fan housing (which necessitates removal 
of the heat exchangers also).  Remove the alternator first - this piece 
belongs directly in front (FIF) of the alternator.  If you can't wiggle it 
in there, you will have to remove the fan housing also.  At that point 
though, the piece should just slide in.
