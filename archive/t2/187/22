Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats & more

Considering how many options were available for vanagons, you would 
expect to find a lot of stuff available.  However after calling a dealer 
locally that had quite a history of vanagon sales i find very 
differently.  He says his dealer ship rarely sold anything but the base 
vanagon or a  westy.  Add ons were mostly dealer and were rarely done.  
That is probably why my westy (which his dealership sold to the orig 
owner) still had the factory block off for the radio in it and the 
antenna is an add on done later(on the opposite side).
