Subject: 71 brakes



Listees, 

AS some of you know I've been trying to fix the brakes on my 71. This had involved replacing the lines,having the calipers rebuilt, replacing the Master Cylinder and generally cleaning and adjusting the system. 
I have a few questions. 

1. What's the order for the final bleed? I have replaced the lines, and have to do the MC this weekend. DO I bleed the MC then the furthest wheel on? Or the wheels then the MC? 

2. My brother has graciously offered to rebuild the calipers for me but is a bit frustrated since the pistons seem to be stuck in there pretty good. He's done caliper rebuilds, but not on anything this old. We've done the air thing, but it seems just to blow out any fluid that was in the caliper, not blow out the pistons. Any suggestions? And if you are going to say do it with a grease gun, where do I get this 'zerk' fitting?   

Thanks all!
