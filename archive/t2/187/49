Subject: Anybody have a weekend free in MD. (help me get to HCBF)

     I'd like to take my new (new to me, anyway) 74 standard bus to the 
upcoming High Country Bus Festival (July 26-28th), but it needs a couple 
things before I could confidently drive it to the corner store, much less 
from MD to NC.
     I will be sending out a request for a couple of parts that I KNOW I 
need, but I would also like somebody with bus experience to give her a once 
or twice over with me one weekend so I can get things fixed before the trip 
if they need it.  I have a Bentley, and I plan to replace fuel lines, but 
for some of the tricky stuff I would like somebody there with me the first 
time I try to do it.  I would like help with making sure the engine is timed 
right, the carb is shooting enough fuel in there, and that the wheels most 
likely won't fall off.  Stuff like that, you know?  Please email me off list 
if you can help me out.  I am far from rich, but will supply beer, food, and 
if you want it maybe some money.  Also have typeI parts to trade.

P.S. Thanks for the thread on the pertronix II, it answered my question and 
then some!
