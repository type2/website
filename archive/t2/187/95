Volks,

I am about to install my auxiliary oil cooler today, and in the kit from =
the bus boys there is a sandwich plate adapter that goes onto the oil  =
filter housing..............It is just a metal thing, no seals or =
anything.  It fits in the stock location and the oil filter will still =
screw on?  I want to have all the questions worked out before I start =
the install, for i want to do it all at the same time!!!
