Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon seats & more

After looking at two 82 vanagons next to my 82 westy I noted some 
differences.  The vanagon could have swivel seats installed like the 
ones on the westy.  If it has the swivel seats you rotate then 90 
degrees in and then release the latches and slide them out. Then the 
base can be removed.  The swivel mechanism is held down by 4 13mm nuts.  
If it doesnt have the swivel you will find that the seat rails are solid 
seat track that is part of the body.  As for engine stuff I have been 
finding that much of the CV engine is unique to 80-83 vanagon/westy.  
The heads however list as a 79 - 83 part.
