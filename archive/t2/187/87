Hi Steve, Beth

I can virtually guarantee both seats contain 0% horsehair. (Unless Beth
added some!)

The seat I used as a driver was rebuilt using 2 layers of some very stiff
carpet underlay as padding. I would do it again that way with the same
material but next time around I would use a softer underlay for the outer
layer. The other seat was rebuilt with the softer & thicker polyester foam
from my ex-73 Z-bed; carved into shape with a serrated kitchen knife. That
one looked a bit over-stuffed, but I'm told it was a comfy ride.

I actually thought of the same response as Dave W; but decided against
posting it. I did laugh when I read it though; it's what I would have told
my kids to do.

Sure wish *I* could make the HCBF, but not this year. Maybe in 2003.
Meanwhile I am looking forward  to seeing folks this weekend at Buses By the
Falls, and later this summer at Buses Of the Corn!

Happy trails,
