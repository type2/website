Subject: Re: Fuel injector Question

Mike,

Both injectors you mention have a flow rate 18.1 lb/hr at 37 psi. So - the
odd one may work just fine.
This web site has a list of injector specs:

Usually a vacuum leak will cause you to run lean, not rich. Doesn't the '81
have an oxy sensor involved in the FI system? If so a malfunctioning oxy
sensor may result in a rich mixture. Of course check all FI components as
best you can per Bentley. Also don't forget the vacuum line to you fuel
pressure regulator - it lowers fuel pressure at higher vacuum so *this*
vacuum leak *could* cause a rich condition.

Good Luck

Ed
