Hi Beth,

I was wondering who got those. I would reccommend "Simple Green" cleaner, it
should be available at Walmart. It's an excellent all-purpose cleaner.

I got those seats with the 79 bus that became my westfakia, and when Steve
Dolan made a set of 79 seats available for exchange of brewskis, I passed my
seats along right away rather than drag them all the way home again. And
since I got them for free, it just would NOT have been proper to sell them.

Happy trails,
