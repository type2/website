Melissa,
    If you want to find a zerk fitting that fits, take your caliper to your
FLAPS and have them try different ones.
Another idea to free that frozen piston is to put your caliper in a bucket
and pour in enough penetrating oil to completely cover it.  Make sure the
bleeder and brake line ports are open so the oil can fill up the inside of
the caliper too.  After a day or two of soaking you should be able to get
that piston out.
