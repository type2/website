Subject: Re: [T2] Front Brakes Question, how to distinguish '71-'72

It is a long a sad story.  The mechanic is a lost case, his tel # is now
disconnected. I should have known better.  He is actually the guy I bought
the bus from.  When I bought it, it had just been inspected, and judging
from the really bad condition that the brakes, and the condition that many
other item were in when I got the bus, I assumed that he had a way to get an
inspection passed easily.  Thus, I thought I would just get him to inspect
it for me.  This after replacing everything brake related: rotors, rebuilt
calipers, flexi lines, wheel cylinders, bearings, etc. etc. I thought it
would pass inspection no problem.  Well he finds problems with the tie rod
ends, ball joints.  He has much trouble knowing how to manage this repair,
hard to get the ball joints in and out, how should this be managed, etc.
etc. I should have just gone and gotten it back.  Well, after 6 weeks of
waiting,  he has the bus ready for me.  Many things have been done by now,
including some welding on the cross members.  But is has passed inspection
and I am really eager to get it back.  He tells me that the clutch is shot,
I take it and go anyway.  He has(had) a big boneyard full of busses and
other stuff and I am not sure what all happened.  I think that he is
probably out of business for good.  I wonder what happened to all his stuff
though.  He had quite a few junkers out there.

Anyway, a few months later, I hear noises when I break coming from the front
right.  I go look and yikes: my rotors have been changed.  Rusty pitted thin
crap rotors.  They have worn the pads to nothing.  I notice that the caliper
rubber seals are all destroyed.  I do not understand this at all.  I replace
the pads and start saving to redo everything.  Now I find nothing seems
right.

I wonder what I have now.  What is necessary to make the '71-'71 to '73+
switch.  It is the steering knuckle, or just the hub??  What rotors do I
use?  What calipers?  I am tempted to just order all '73+ stuff and hope for
the best.  But, I have reservations.  I may do that anyway.  I now have
pretty much all that I need for '72, with a complete set of both, I should
be able to get things going again.  Geeze, what a pain.
