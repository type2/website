Hope I didn't step on your toes. I talk to more young "kids" (I'm thirty) 
that buy a VW and immediately start talking about turbos and nitrous and 
blowers and all this stuff and they haven't even figured out how to change 
the oil yet.

Didn't know who you are and anything about you.

Glad to see a lister or two is building a Megasquirt system and that it was 
easier than my impression.

If you pursue this keep me updated.


Ciao!
