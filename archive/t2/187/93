Subject: transmission oil

I've finally got to the transmission on my list of maintenance checks.  The
Bentley says on 1973 and later vehicles the hypoid doesn't need to be
changed.  Is this true?

I searched the archives and there was a great debate a while back about GL4
vs. GL5.

1) How do I know if I need to change the oil?

2) Is GL4 all that's recommended still.  Which brand is still available in a
GL4.
