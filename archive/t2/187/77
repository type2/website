Subject: Nasty old rust

Aside from the under windshield area and battery trays, this is the nastiest
rust spot that I'm worried about.  It has been hiding behind my bumper and
is from a minor bumper impact that happened in 1979 by the PO.

These are old photos from Feb.  You can just make out the crease that the
bumper made in the body from the impact:

What's the best way to repair this?  Get the whole lower corner panel or
treat it?
