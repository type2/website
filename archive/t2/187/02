Simple - just wire the additional injectors in parallel with the 'normal' 4.
MegaSquirt has 2 driver output for injectors, so you can split them into 2
banks. This allows you to fire them alternately so that dips in fuel
pressure are minimized.

A wire from the points provided the signal for firing the injectors. This is
one of the areas that is a bit difficult since the signal varies for
different cars - many have an electronic module while others (old vw's for
instance) are running point/coil ignition. A couple of mods were made to the
MS input circuit to attempt to remedy this, and the mods are in the latest
HW version that will be part of the current group buy. I have a Tiger CDI
but am running it in stock ignition mode now since I was not yet able to get
the MS to fire from the CDI signal. In the end I plan on using running with
the CDI but need to resolve this issue.

Also - someone mentioned the need for a crank sensor - this is NOT so. MS is
not sequential injection - it is triggered from the ignition signal - just
like the VW bus's beloved stock injection as well as most OEM injection
systems (at least until very recently when some have gone to sequential).

Don't have any numbers. I also try not to give seat of my pants impressions
since they mean so little!
