Subject: Electronic ignition and a melted lollipop

Ok, my four year old daughter left a lollipop on the front passenger
seat of my 78 bus and it melted into the cloth upholstery.  True, it is
my fault; I should not have given her the lolli, but these seats are new
to me, given to me at Everybus 2002 by some nice guy whose name I
forget, and I want to get this junk off my seat!  Any suggestions?
    Also, I am looking to install electronic ignition in my bus; it is
fuel injected 2 liter; is there a specific brand recommended?  Does the
fuel injection make a difference what kind I get?  Sorry for my
ignorance.  Beth and Prudence the 78 Baywindow.
