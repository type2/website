Subject: Will missing tin destroy my engine?

On my newly rebuilt 2 liter engine, the "warm air duct, right rear" was not 
installed with the tin assembly when the engine was put back into the 1976 
Bus chassis.  I just discovered this fact.

I have the part (021-119-358U) on my desk. I found a picture of it on the 
Bus Boys web site.
I am looking at the Bus Boys web site engine tin section for diagrams of 
where this part fits.
You can see it at        http://www.bus-boys.com/
under the category "Air cooling system parts, type 2 and vanagon , 72 to 83"
designated item "V"  in the diagram found there.

The basic question is: Can I run the engine without this "warm air duct," 
or will its absence put my newly rebuilt engine at risk of overheating?

If there is such a risk, what is the magnitude of that risk? Can I start 
and idle the engine for 10 minutes, to adjust various settings, but not run 
the vehicle out on the road under load?

I am very unsure of where it goes, from the diagrams. The diagrams don't 
resemble what I see when I am under the bus. From the name "warm air duct, 
right rear" I am guessing that it goes vertically at the passenger side 
rear of the installed engine, to shut off the space I can see looking up, 
at the rear of the cooling fins for the rear cylinder on the passenger 
side. (Cylinder number 2 ?)  From this viewpoint, I can also see the 
thermostat cable as it makes its 90 degree turn at the pulley. If someone 
can verify this impression, I will be helped. I need to know where it 
belongs, in detail, beyond "right rear."

The final question is: Do I have to drop the engine to fit this tin in 
place? To do it with the engine in place looks like an impossibly tight 
space to work.

Thanks again for all the great help in getting these last few problems solved.
