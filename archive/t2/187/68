VW tested these fuels when they first appeared (in volume) in the 70's 
and found that the normal percentages used in the pump variety did no 
damage.  In the 70's it was just known as gasahol.  The problem arises 
if you use an alcohol mix normally associated with hot rods.  Then you 
will have lubrication and heat problems at the valves.  As for what 
brands.  All mix in the winter months and you will get the fuel all 
summer long as well.  The "oxygenated" fuels are required in many areas 
of the country in the winter.. .  Check your car manual.  The VW 
specification (as with most mfr) is that no more than 10% be alcohol and 
that it meet the octane rating needed for your vehicle.  BTW if you are 
in Cal all brands all year around are blended.
