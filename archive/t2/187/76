Yes. Swap over several 78 parts:
fan housing & alternator, oil filler tube,
motor mount , engine tin, exhaust system.

If these are the heads you just destroyed,
then no :). As i recall, you sucked #1 exhaust
guide into the combustion chamber, but left
the valve, spring, retainer, and keepers,.intact ?
Thiis is most unusual. I can't see how anything
( other than the valve seat ) could get past the
exhaust valve while the engine is running,
much less leaving it intact. Photos ?!
What were the circumstances ?
