Subject: RE: [T2] The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems

No, What the Ignitor II does is have active variable dwell. In simple
english, dwell controls the electrical saturation of the coil. You want the
coil to be a full saturation so that, when it discharges, it gives you the
hottest and longest lasting spark. With points ignition and the Ignitor I
ignition dwell is a set number; therefore your ignition is only optimized at
a particular RPM. The Ignitor II has electronics in it that varies the dwell
so that you achieve coil saturation at a wide range of engine RPMs. If your
planning to run a capacitive discharge the Ignitor II probably isn't better
than an Ignitor I since coil saturation is controlled by a different device.
