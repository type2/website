Take a screwdriver to release the stops on the track, and slide them
out.

The track is part of the seat base or fenderwell whatever.
You'll have to take along a drill to remove the spot welds.

The interior door panel is different.

Later,

I'm hittin' the road this weekend to visit a friend and an 82 Vanagon he
has on his farm. I'll probably take the front seats home with me for my
79. What tools do I need to remove the front seats? Should I take the
seat tracks and all? 
Also, will the sliding door interior panel from the 82 fit my 79? 
Eventually I plan to drag this van home with me. I have a 78 engine in
my van, could I just take the shortblock from the 82 and put my 78 heads
on it? 
Thanks, 
Rob
