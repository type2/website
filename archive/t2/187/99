Not sure of the circumstances, a friend gave me this
engine in it's current condition, he had only owned it
a couple of weeks.  Best I can tell it's never
been rebuilt.

Of course I wouldn't bolt a bad head on to the 82 shortblock.  I have
high hopes that the bad head can be rebuilt.  I don't
have any pictures of the head & piston yet, but when
I pulled the valve cover off, look what fell out:

I ran it through my scanner, woulda stuck the head on there
too my but my wife wouldn't let me :-)

As for the head, there is a layer of gold colored metal
that appears to have been hammered onto the lower surface
of the head, meaning the semi-circular flat area between the=20
valve seats and the mating surface.  The pretty, shiny gold
metal also covers the lower portion of the piston.  The exhaust
valve looks nicked, but other than that it's still there, spring,=20
retainer and all, hard to view the seat (no spring compressor yet)
but it appears to be there.

Thanks,

Rob
