Subject: Bosh FI analyzer

I came across a Bosh fuel injected engine analyzer. The person I  was
talking to said that it was her father's who worked for VW America for 50
years. It was the piece that goes between the bus brain and the analyzer.
It's in almost mint condition. Does anyone know how much it's worth. I want
to offer a fair price for it as her father is now in a nursing home and
needs the money.
