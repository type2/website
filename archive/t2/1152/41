Subject: Paint Codes and Buying Paint

So I am finally getting around to bodywork and painting my '78 Champagne
Westy. I see the sticker behind the drivers seat that says something like
pastelle and some number code and then aubricht or something and another code.
I wrote them down but dont have them in front of me. Anyway I'm guessing these
are the codes for the white and brown that make up the two tone OEM paint
scheme.
 
I am going to do all of the preliminary bodywork and shoot primer myself, but
I want to buy paint to give to the guy who is going to do the final painting
for me. Can I just take these codes to my local NAPA and say sell me 2 qts of
this white and a gallon of this brown? I want to make sure I am using the
original colors. So the question is what info do the paint people need to
match/blend this paint?
 
Also I am needing to paint the inside of the doors as I am replacing them with
rust free versions and I sanded already. Is is safe to assume that the shade
of white on the outside is the same as the shade of white on the inside? Or is
this another color and if so what is that code?
 
Thanks,
