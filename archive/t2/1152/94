Fuel pressure is constant under load, so it's not a fuel delivery problem.

Fuel delivery doesn't seem to be the problem.  I can rev the engine up 
and push on the AFM flap and make it run really rich until it dies.  I 
couldn't get the engine to hit more than 3600 or something like that, 
and it should easily hit 4500 in neutral.
