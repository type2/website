Subject: Was stumped...now embarassed!

Well, I seem to have fixed my missing and bucking engine problem, but not until after I drove to Columbus and bought a spare engine!! 
AFter making the trek and unloading the new engine, I decided to look at the one in question one last time before pulling it.
I had an extra distributor with electronic points that I keep in my spare parts box as a spare for my 71 Westy.
WHen I put it in, it took off and ran great, no bucking, missing or popping!! Seems my "known good" distributor set-up that was on the engine was not so good :-(  I am guessing it was the condensor on that dizzy that was failing (HEy Frank B, has that ever happened to you?!?! Yeah, me too!! which is why I feel like such a jackass right now!!) And I could have SWORN it was an all good set-up dizzy!!!
Anyway.... we're back in business!

PEACE!
