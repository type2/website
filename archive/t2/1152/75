it can be done, I've done it with a type IV engine a couple times, is 
easier.  get someone with small hands and long arms to do it. lay on the 
top deck and reach around. if you can get the firewall off you should be 
able to do it.  an 8-10 yr old girl might be your best bet. let them 
practice on a dummmy they let them go at it.
