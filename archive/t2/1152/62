Subject: Re: [T2] Ditching the vent wing?

Yes on the glass.  Technically there somewhere exists the rear side glass (for
a RHD with sliders on the left, or a base model without wings) but the only
practical difference is that the etched glass logo will end up on the outside
using a common US spec passenger side glass.
 
Seal is mirror image of passenger and is available new from any of the common
rubber suppliers.
 
It is a good ditch, lot cheaper than finding a ventwing in good shape.

There is a vent wing window in my bus ('78 champagne westy) on the drivers
side rear side window. Can I replace this window with a full non opening
window like the passenger side? These vent wing windows always rust and mine
is. Is the passenger glass and seal the same size?
