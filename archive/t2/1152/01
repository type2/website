Drove an '81 Westy beater from Edison, NJ and didn't realize I hadn't fully
reconnected alternator with the engine install till I started sputtering just
past Hancock, MD about 250-260 miles.  And that was on the beater probably 5
year old+ battery that was sitting in the thing for 2-3 months dead flat, but
had taken a good full charge before I left.  I did have a follow car, we
didn't have a spare battery but I figured out the issue and we jumped it. 
That was absolute straight through except one short gas stop about 45 minutes
prior to it dying, where it had started just fine oddly enough.
 
Thing didn't have a radio hooked up, and this was all daylight driving in the
summer.  I mean another way to look at this is that FI and pump probably
although energy hogs are still pulling what 10 amps, perhaps 15 along with the
ignition.  So four hours if you got about 60 Ah in the battery, a bit more or
less depending on quality/condition.
 
But like I said, one must think very carefully about where/when you are going
to breakdown to change battery, and where/what that might mean for life and
death on our highway system.  Very realistic concern in todays world.

Really? I assume that's with no stopping/restarting....which if she brins her
bus too, we could jump,  So I would think the fuel pump has the biggest draw-
along with injectors, coil, etc.  I have a new battery, and we will drive it
for an hour and see the voltage drop.
