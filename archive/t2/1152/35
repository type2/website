ebay nearly always yields fair market value, even if you start the
auction at 1 penny, which is now free, by the way under their new
policy of free listings under 99 cents.

If you are a buyer, you may not like the final price because it is too
high, and if you are a seller, you may not like the price because it
is too low, but ebay has gotten so big now that nearly everything
sells at fair market value with a max variation of 20%.
