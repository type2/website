John,

While your argument may hold true for items that you buy, I can say
for certain that it does not hold true for many other items. I have
bought several high quality tools recently, for example,  and have
observed sales of new items selling at a discount of 60-80% and the
exact same item used and abused selling for 110%. Absolutely crazy.
And yet, it takes significant effort to be a knowledgeable and
patience buyer; some people are willing to make this investment and
others are not.
