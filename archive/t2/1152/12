	For classic racing bikes that are cursed with coil ignition 
as opposed to magnetos, 'total loss' is practically universal in this 
part of the world.


>... must be recharged after each usage."

	The current drawn by a 12V coil ignition for 1, 2 or 3 
cylinders may look like c.4A when you turn on the ignition switch, 
but then as soon as the motor is revving, even with no generator, it 
decreases to c. 1A  -  something about back-emf in which I'm out of 
my AC depth 8-).
	If the bus battery has a genuine capacity of say 50 Ah, just 
running the ignition might therefore last a day or two of continuous 
running  ...   that is merely crude theory, which actual experience 
will always trump (and yes, that's a dedicated theorist talking :-) ).
	Of course, some buses have further electrical loads imposed 
on them by electrically-powered fuel pump, electrically-powered fuel 
injection,   ...
	Now if someone would slap a decent magneto on a bus with T1 
motor, and drive only in daylight, and add a bulb horn from India, 
then no battery would be needed  -  given furthermore that parking 
could always be on a hill for a rolling start, or that holes get made 
in the rear of the body to let in a crank-handle to engage a modified 
nut on the rear of the crankshaft  ...
