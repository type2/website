Subject: WANTED: Brake Servos (Boosters)

I need a few cores. They need not work, only be rebuildable. Will offer a
fair price, or an even higher Bus Depot store credit, and will email you a
prepaid shipping label. If you have any, please let me know your asking
price and whether you know if it works.
