Reminds me of the "Total Loss Ignition" that my vintage bike racer
friends sometimes set up.

"Total loss ignition eliminates the alternator and related electrics
for charging the
battery. Along with the weight reduction by eliminating the alternator, you get
the added benefit of removing the rotating mass of the alternator from
the end of
the crankshaft, allowing the engine to spin up faster. The battery
runs all electrics
needed and must be recharged after each usage."
