Subject: 79 bus Front Transmission Mount part number lookup

Yesterday I posted a question regarding the front transmission mount  
for my '79 bus seeming to be incorrect.

OK so today I crawled under there and got the part number off the  
transmission mount.  It is 211 599 243.  I would like to look up this  
part number to determine what year bay windows that this part is  
compatible with.  Does someone have access to a part number list?

Thanks

Tim
