Went through this with my bus initially. Injector seals and an EGR valve 
that was leaking all the time. Only supposed to flow I think at certain 
throttle positions. I blocked mine off b/c they are not required here 
(yet).

Also replaced all the smaller vacuum hoses. Found some of the gas tank 
vent hoses were rotten too.

Not expensive to do these things.
