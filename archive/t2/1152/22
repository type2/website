Subject: Stumped in Sacramento

Since the demise of my "daily driver" I've been driving the bus every 
day until my new car is ready to pick up.  For the last couple of weeks 
the bus (78 2.0 FI California) has been running noisy and rough.  It got 
to the point last night that the bus stalls when I lift my foot from the 
gas pedal.  It's sitting at home.  Good thing it's bicycle weather...

I've pulled and checked the plugs and plug wires (which are only a month 
old, checked the vacuum hoses and all electrical connectors.  Checked 
the FI unit as well for loose cables wires and plugs.

There is an exhaust leak on the end of the crossover pipe, but I've had 
that for a while and it never bothered anything.  When I pull the engine 
next month to replace the Tin and Breather for the gas tank, I was going 
to fix it then.

But I still need to get around.  Any quick thoughts before I call 
"Enterprise to pick me up"?

Thanks,

BEN
