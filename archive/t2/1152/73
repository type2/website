Subject: Fuel sending unit

Has anyone successfully connected the wire from the gas gauge to the fuel
sending unit while the engine and gas tank are in the bus?  I have a 1968 with
a Type I engine and a later fuel tank from an FI bus.  For reasons not to be
mentioned, the fuel sending unit wire isn't connected, and I can't get my hand
between the tank and the top of the engine compartment to connect it.

I'm curious if anyone was completed this "super human" feat w/o pulling the
engine.
