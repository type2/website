Like most said, this sounds like a lean-running engine.  Because it 
happens under load and not at idle, it sounds like there isn't enough 
fuel being delivered at the higher loads.  So, I would verify that you 
have proper fuel flow - pressure is one thing, but the actual amount of 
fuel is another.  If you can have someone check the fuel pressure while 
it's under load, that would be optimal.  If it drops, you know there's a 
problem with the supply line.  Another way to check this would be to 
pull off the fuel line from the carb and turn on the pump and make sure 
it's flowing enough fuel - my mechanic friend said that it should be 
flowing generously (I don't do carbs, so I don't really know).

Like others mentioned, fuel filter, fuel tank, clogged jets (high range) 
and fuel lines.  If it is in-fact a blockage, but the pump can pull 
enough fuel at idle (due to the minor amount needed), the engine will 
idle just fine.  Once you push beyond the amount of fuel that's 
available to the pump, you'll go lean and exhibit the behaviors you 
described.

good luck!
Mike
