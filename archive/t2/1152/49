Subject: window regulator install

I have a 1973 Westy. I have purchased a window regulator (the cranking
mechanism) that I need to install in the driver-side door (the old one has
already been removed). It seems a tight fit getting the new
one up/over/around some of the stuff in the door and I am wondering if
anyone out there has suggestions on how to "get her done"???
