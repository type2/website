Yeah, I wouldn't fall into the novice category - I think it's safe to 
say that I qualify as "very advanced" as far as VW EFI is concerned ;) 
That said, we're not making permanent changes with the AFM - just 
pushing on the arm to richen/lean the mixture.  We can kill the engine 
either way so the injectors are definitely injecting fuel.  Oddly it 
seems like the mixture is perfect and something is stopping it from 
accelerating.  I haven't hooked up a wideband yet, but I'd venture to 
guess that this is not due to lean/rich running because it isn't 
exhibiting those behaviors.

Like I mention above, I don't think it's a fuel issue because I can make 
it blow smoke by pushing on the AFM arm to excessively richen the mixture.

This year has the hall sensor, idle control module, and the other 
ignition controller dealio between the idle control and the coil (I 
forget what it's called).  We did check timing and it seems to be within 
spec (getting 32 degrees) so the engine should easily rev faster than it 
is.  I'm beginning to wonder if something got sucked into the intake and 
is not allowing adequate airflow... that, or maybe the throttle valve is 
somehow tweaked

Yeah, we checked all of the connections both at the various sensors and 
through the harness and everything checked out.  We're gonna have 
another mechanic take a look at it with a fresh set of eyes and see if 
there's anything he can think of.  Weird!
