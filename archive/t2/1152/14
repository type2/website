Seems like I got about an hour out of our bus running the lights and the 
stereo once when the fan belt flipped off. My alternator light did not 
work so I did not know until it was getting hard to see but I had 
started out about an hour before. Stereo was a 25W stereo, not a big 
honkin' thumper stereo. The battery had age on it, but it cranked the 
engine well enough when it was charged. Stopped at a store, replaced the 
belt, got a jump from a friendly and interested Ford Escort driver and I 
was happily charging again. This was years ago.
