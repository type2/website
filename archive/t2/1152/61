Subject: Ditching the vent wing?

There is a vent wing window in my bus ('78 champagne westy) on the drivers
side rear side window. Can I replace this window with a full non opening
window like the passenger side? These vent wing windows always rust and mine
is. Is the passenger glass and seal the same size?
 
Thanks
 
 
Ted
