Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sending unit

It probably goes without saying that cutting a hatch was not the answer I was
looking for.  My mechanic forgot to connect the sending unit wire when
installing the new tank and engine.  This appears to be a pretty painful
mistake, and I'm not inclined to drop the engine myself or wait for my
mechanic to get around to fixing this.

My wife had a go at it this afternoon, as her arms are skinnier than mine.
However, she couldn't quite get the coordination of putting the connector on
the spade looking at it through the mirror.  That said, I think she earned
maximum spouse brownie points for trying.

I managed to get the connector touching the spade by holding the connector
with a needle nose pliers, but in the end I had the same problem with the
mirror.  I just could not quite line it up perfectly to get them mated up.
But I came close, and I think if I get the mirror in a better position
(directly behind the sending unit) I can make it happen.  I was really just
looking for a ray of hope.

Thanks to all.
