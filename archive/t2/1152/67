Hi Volks,

Made it out to Portland Oregon. The transmission I installed in Ohio
is working well and I bussed it across the country with no major
incidents.

Portland is the land of milk and honey for buses. Went up to
"Trafton's" to fin d a door handle replacement (the pot-metal levering
portion broke somewhere in Montana or Idaho). Trafton was great
letting me pick through the buses in the back to find a replacement.
And  there it was a pile of transmissions, like something out of a
dream.

Also went over to a place called Halsey's Foreign Auto for an oil
breather gasket - it's really something to walk into a parts store
that sells air-cooled heads. Not like any auto store I ever visited in
New York.

Funny thing about Portland, where I've coined the motto, "a pop-top on
every block", is that there are so many buses and vanagons cruising
around here that fellow owners don't even smile or wave.

Anyway, I still do.

peace
