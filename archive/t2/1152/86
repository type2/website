Subject: How do I install door window outside chrome+rubber scraper

Last weekend I tried replacing the door window outside chrome+rubber
scraper piece on the passenger side of my 74 bay.
The chrome part borders the window on the outside, and the rubber
scraper keeps water from running down into the door. Its all riveted
together as a single unit.

Anyway, the installation I did was less than satisfying. Can't find
anything about it in Bentley.

1) Is it necessary to completely remove the window from the door to
install? I can't find a way to get the little clips to fit into the
holes in the door frame. There's just no room with the window in
there, even cranked all the way down.

2) Is it necessary to remove the window frame felt piece, install the
chrome thing, and then install the felt piece again?

Thanks for any suggestions!

Scott
