Sounds like Pastelweiss (Pastel White) --Dupont L90D.  Is your van 
off-white?  (the white part that is)

You can also get the original paint colours from the m-plate which is 
riveted on the the air duct behind the fuse box.  It's all in code but 
there's a great website to translate it.  www.vw-mplate.com
