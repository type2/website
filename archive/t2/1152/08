Is this a "new" engine? Could be something wrong with the build? I  
had all kinds of problems with a trusty 100 k miles motor after I  
changed the front seal and clutch. I changed out everything  
imaginable to try and fix it. The third time I cleaned the pict 34  
carb it began to run normal. It is a great 100k mile engine.  
Compression over 120 psi in all cylinders. I know, it's going to blow  
tomorrow!
