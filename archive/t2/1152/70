Subject: engine shipping , Ontario,or Buffalo to Cali

I am still trying to find a way to get an Type 1 engine from my place to
Cali.
Cambridge Ont,,  or I can take it to USA , like Niagara Falls, or Buffalo NY
area,,
it is going to Downey Calif  90241

Anyone have a good idea?   recommendations?    I have called a LOT of
shipping co. in my area that go to Calif.. but they all balk when I say
engine!  even in a crate, with all fluids drained.

I can cover all bases,, like anytime pick up, dock, or level, assisted
lifting device avail... semi truck, or van ...

The only Canadian company i found so far quoted on min load of 2500lbs.
tooo much $$$

I took an T1 engine from here to North Carolina on the luggage rack of my 74
westfalia!  lol,,  it was a piece of cake!

I might just have to take a road trip to Downey, eh?  lol
