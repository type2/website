Don and another guy diagnosed the problem.  The "S-boot" was intact but 
two of the hoses coming out of it had fallen off.  New clamps and it 
runs again.  To Joe Average, already replaced injector seals and EGR 
last Spring and that helped.  Breather hose is next when I drop the 
engine in a week or so.  My new Daily Driver comes home tomorrow which 
will give me time to work on the bus!  Thanks all!  BEN
