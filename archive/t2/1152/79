A reciprocating saw does a pretty good job, there is plenty of clearance 
underneath for the blade, at least in a later bay.  A squarish hole 
(verses a round hole) gives you corners to pry against when removing the 
newer style senders, I drill the corners with a 3/4" hole saw and then 
use the reciprocating saw to do the straight cuts. The hole should be 
about 1.5  inches to the right of center.  The original VW spec hole was 
round and kind of small. It was hard to work through and you could 
barely get the sender out through it, give yourself a bit more room. A 
squarish hole 3.5 x 3.5 works well.
