Look at plug colors to start with. If you could borrow an OS 
sensor/meter... If you could get a jet and keep reaming the main jet 
out... Don't have alot of experience with that kind of engine or carb. 
Only done this on 36mm Dellorto DRLAs and I was able to find some charts 
and jet suggestions from a Porsche performance book.
