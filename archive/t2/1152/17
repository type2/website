Subject: Re: [T2] 79 bus Front Transmission Mount part number lookup

As noted in my 'signature line' please reply to the list, not directly
to me. I'm pretty good with Google, not a bottomless pit of VW info.

Also, use "REPLY" then correct the address to send to the list rather
than creating a new message to keep the messages about your subject
grouped together in email readers that use proper "threading".

Now, on to the actual message ...

From the image you attached I suspect 211 599 243B is the SET of both
pieces. Reply to this message (to the LIST address) with a link to the
image online so others can have a look and chime in.
