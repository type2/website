Subject: window seals 

ok,, I have to install my windows.. and I am having trouble getting the new
rubber seals on to the glass!

The rear hatch window seal went on with only a little trouble,, and the
window went into the door with ease!

I am going to do the windshield and back side windows ...
I have a big gas radiant heater pointed at them to warm them ,, but that
freakin gap doesn't want to slide onto the glass!

any tips.. tricks,,,   Wife said.. call Doug the mobile glass guy,,, lol
