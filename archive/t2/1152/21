Subject: Late Bay Front Transmission Mount Wanted

I am would like to purchase a late bay front transmission mount in  
good working condition.  This would include both the mounting bracket  
that bolts to the nosecone and the two-prong metal/rubber front  
transmission mount insert that fits inside the mounting bracket.  The  
correct parts would only come from a 76-79 Bay (6-rib tranny).  The  
correct part number for the mounting bracket is 211 599 243 B.  The  
"B" is important.   I do not know the part number for the two-pronged  
mount insert but it must fit the correct mounting bracket.  The part  
number will be stamped on the mounting bracket.

Does anyone out there have this set-up?
