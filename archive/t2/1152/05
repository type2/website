Subject: Help me - I'm stumped!!

OK, I am a pretty decent air-cooled diagnostician, but this one has me stumped...HELP!

Dual Port engine (PO tells me it was built up to 1915, but looks like 1600DP to me!).  When the engine is under load it starts to buck like crazy , miss, and pop.

Heres what I know:

*Starts up and idles fine
*Good carburetor, adjusted properly
*Good compression 150+ on all cylinders
*Good coil
*Dwell and timeing are spot-on
*Valve gap correct, all valve appear to open and close properly
*New dizzy cap and points

WIld cards:
*Generic electric fuel pump (the kind that supposed to deliver about 4 lbs pressure.  I tried 2 known good ones, same results

SO what would give me this "bucking" action given the "known goods"

PEACE! 
John Baker
