Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sending unit

While everyone has given excellent solutions, no one has addressed
gauge and sender compatibility.  The lever sender of the the FI tank
is NOT compatible with the 1968 gauge or will offer an accurate
reading.  You must use the later style gauge with voltage stabilizer
(aka "vibrator") for it to work correctly.  You need this from a Bus
from VIN 2x3 2138 901 onwards.  Time hit a boneyard for a later
cluster or gauge w/stabilizer. That's probably why it has never been
connected.
