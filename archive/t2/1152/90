Subject: Problem with Vanagon lack of power

I'm working with a friend to try and figure out what's up with a 
Vanagon that he's working on.  When it's just idling and you try and 
rev it, it won't go any higher than about 3400 or so, which is kinda 
odd.. almost seems like there's a rev limiter in there or something. 
 When you drive it, it lacks any kind of power, but it doesn't exhibit 
any signs of running lean or rich.  We've verified that all injectors 
are firing, compression is good (125 all around), spark plugs are all 
working as well.  We've even tried driving it while having someone in 
the back tweaking away at the AFM to make it run richer or leaner with 
no apparent change in power, so it doesn't seem to be a fuel delivery 
issue.

This is an automatic 1982 California Vanagon, btw.  Anyone have any 
ideas what might be up?

Thanks!
Mike
