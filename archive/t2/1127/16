"Why not install some ducting "

Still laughing!  That is an awesome pic I'll be forwarding to my pop-trailer
friends...

To save the top from shiver, you could hang some fabric to divert some of
the flow downward... With your 71, I'm not sure how much space you have from
the window to where the top bunk bed (cot?) starts... in my Riviera, I have
a fair amount of space for the air to "pour" downwards, so I'm actually not
sure how cool the top will be unless I have the a/c fan at 11...
