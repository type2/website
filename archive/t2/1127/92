Go for the 2mm thick discs, the 1mm break too easy when they get away
from you --- and they WILL get away from occasionally. 

You'll want to play with them when you get them. Take some aspirin
before you start playing. And be prepared for at least one
'blood-blister' when two of them snap together with a bit of
unsuspecting skin between.

Don't try to pry them apart or pry them off of anything you've stuck
them on. Slide them sideways until you can grab one and stand it on
edge.

DX has good China prices and low/free shipping. But don't order today
if you need it next week. Two to six weeks minimum. Eight to ten weeks
quite often.
