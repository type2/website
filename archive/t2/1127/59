Subject: Cause of extreme overheat?

This is a general knowledge question.

On Sunday I was at a rest area off I-5 in Washington state and there 
was a couple with a '71 Westy that had big time overheat problems. 
Overheat enough to get a fire as the fan belt and such melted/burnt, 
the guy told me the crew from the fire truck chipped for the money 
for a new belt, wires, etc.
He told me he had 10k miles on a rebuild.

After putting the new parts on he told me that it got really really 
hot after maybe 2 min driving, after sitting all night he reset the 
valves (they were really tight). He drove it and it happened again, 
super hot and the valves tight after sitting another night.

Other than ask if the generator was turning free (he said is was) I 
suggested something blocking the fan inlet or restricting the 
exhaust. It's been sometime since I drove a '71.
I guessed his engine had serious problems and I was in no position to 
help past the talking. These things happen...

I'm just curious about what 'might' cause a serious overheat, hot 
enough to cook the fan belt, melt wires and generally look like the 
engine was on fire.

Like I said at the beginning this is not my problem but a general 
knowledge question at this point.
