Sure if you want it to peel off in sheets like bad latex house paint.
 
PPG, PPG, PPG.
 
It really is a Chevy/Ford thing.  Dupont and PPG both make top line products
as do several others.  When I started painting though, Delstar (what I shot
most as urethanes were pricey and hard to shoot) was superior to the current
Dupont Centari in longetivity by years (particularly in reds)  Oddly though of
course actually Dupont had the premier etching primer at the time, though most
of us PPG guys learned even if it wasn't etching, DP40 was never going to let
go or allow rust (and I mean in the salt belt folks.)   I consider Nason
second line however.  But with good prep, and keeping in a product line, damn
near anything will provide acceptable results, even the much lower quality
parts store lines.  Lots of VW folks of course love Glasurit, the last I shot
it (mid 90s) I was very underwhelmed.  Whatever you do, pick a line, for cost
or reputation, and stick to it.

Any dupont sealer would be great.  If budget does not allow for Dupont, Nason
makes a great paint and sealer.
