Subject: RE: [T2] Camping AC placement survey

Great idea but not really practical.  My AC vent won't reach from the house to
the campsite.  :)

But seriously, camping in the summer down here usually means temps 90-100+
degrees Fahrenheit, with a heat index of 120 and 40% or higher humidity.  Even
the night temps have been pushing close to 90 some days.  If you want to go
with your kids somewhere during the summer when they are out of school then AC
is the only viable option.


Thanks,

Quick survey...

I have a 1971 Westfalia and the heat down in Alabama is awful, so I have
setup
a 6,500 BTU window-style AC unit to help cool things off while camping.  In
addition to the heat in the main part of the bus, the heat "upstairs" in the
tent section is bad and that is where I have a continental bed setup for my
kids.

The question is this...  Based on the experience of those out on the
listserv,
where is the best placement of the AC unit?


A.      Setup the AC in the door of the front cab (similar to

B.      Setup the AC in the luggage rack (like
