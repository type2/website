Clever!

What sort of bracket did you use for the radio?

There's an arrow pointing to it - it's that standard metal strip with a hole
about every inch or so... I brought it straight up to a screw location for
the speaker in the center dash I don't have.

Good point - My Bus is a 79. Unfortunately, I'm not savvy on dash
interchangeability, but I'm sure someone on here is. mike
