Subject: Re: [T2] Next stupid question about painting - Epoxy Primer

PPG DP40, 90, etc.  You can leave it for YEARS, I use it actually (in black)
as my standard topcoat for VW wheel rims, and have used it (as have friends)
for suspension bits, frames, etc. for years.  To me is better than powdercoat
for the same, as powdercoat isn't all its cracked up to be (peels off in
sheets when it gets chipped in the winter in the salt belt) and DP40 you can
repaint and spot repair chips.  It isn't quite as good since it became DP40LF
(somewhere in the mid 90s) but is still amazing.  You can scuff and topcoat at
any point, though I usually scuff shoot another coat of DP40, then topcoat. 
It is however impervious to water and will protect the metal from corrosion
indefinitely if not damaged.
 
Anyway I'm a PPG guy as long known though of course.   YMMV.

So I've been surfing the web, and some sites are saying that Epoxy Primer IS
waterproof and can be left on without a top cover for months, and other sites
saying apply paint asap. Anyone with experience on this?
