Hi Kevin,

I checked mine - it looks like I just got lucky with the depth of my
gauges...

I'm sure you've thought of this - but does the center gauge the longest
depth?  Could you move it to the side spot to clear the ashtray?
If you notice, my radio hangs, and was sitting on the gauges and ashtray
until I used a bracket to lift the arse end up a bit... is your radio
pressing the gauge(s) down?

The only other idea I came up with is using the front plate as a template,
and cut a piece of wood to mount behind the plate, on/ in front of the dash
(sanded and painted to match) as a spacer to move the gauges forward until
they clear the ashtray... good luck man. mike
