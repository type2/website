Subject: Next stupid question about painting - Epoxy Primer

So I've been surfing the web, and some sites are saying that Epoxy Primer IS
waterproof and can be left on without a top cover for months, and other sites
saying apply paint asap. Anyone with experience on this?
Thanks once again,
Courtney
