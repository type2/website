Excellent points!  I have the wife and two kids, and we sleep in half of the
tent.

In the other half we keep chairs, clothes, and a porta-potti (small marine
toilet).  Some day, when we connect it to the bus, there is a 5'x3' space
between the bus and main section of the tent that will house the potty for my
wife.
