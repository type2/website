I had so much fun!  I even surfed in the surf competition.  That was 
pretty funny - I was out surfing, yapping with the people in the surf 
jersies and they asked if I wanted to compete, so I was like, sure.. 
what the heck!  (I've never surfed in a competition before).  So, I surf 
in the next heat, go in to turn in my jersey and they tell me in I'm the 
finals!  I didn't win the next heat (the other guys were really good), 
but I had a blast.  Great crowd, and a lot of really nice buses!!

Mike
