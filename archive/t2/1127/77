Subject: Cause of extreme overhear

I've had this happen on a couple of buses I've owned, extreme over heating. I
found the oil cooler seals contract and reduce the flow if oil through the
cooler when they get hot.  I know it's alot if work, but every VW I buy, I
pull the motor and replace the oil cooler seals, along with many other items.
Just a thought.
