I'll add one: Wrong distributor.  I once had a vendor accidentally sell me a dizzy for a type-4 engine.  It had too much advance, so at full advance I was up around 40-45 BTDC (way too advanced).  I only determined this by using a timing light and having been lucky enough to have a degree pulley for my crank.  That one took a while to figure out.
