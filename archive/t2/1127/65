You'd want to shield it from rain and road splash though. Inverters are 
picky about that.

For the true economy project I saw a little 2 cycle ginny at Northern 
Tool. Looks like a large weedwacker motor coupled to a ginny.

$150! 1000W

I know my weedwackers have been pretty quiet when they were new. Less so 
as the muffler rotted out from the inside.

Thought about using a spare weed wacker motor and building a long 
muffler/pipe to see how quiet I could get it for stationary uses or for 
an electric go-cart. Let the kids ride on the battery and then switch on 
the ginny after the battery is depleted to ride some more. Or swap out 
the battery... Yeah - too easy... Complicated! Complicated! Must have 
more complicated! GRIN!

I think I'll look to European caravan websites and see what sort of high 
efficiency solutions they've got. The domestic stuff seems to assume 
bigger is better in every case. For an example see my father's ~4,000W 
Coleman ginny that is so loud it could wake the dead and power a cruise 
ship. The Honda 2000i would fill his needs.
