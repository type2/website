Subject: Clutch Adjustment

Hi everyone,

I adjusted my clutch today to spec, 1/2" - 1". '71 Westy with the
stock 1600. For the past 5 or 6 years I have always driven with about
3" of play as it felt better to me. However, the change today made the
van much more drive-able. Since I have never had it within the
tolerance of an inch, is there anything I should be aware of in case I
made it to tight? I don't want to burn my clutch up. Drove around
about 40 miles today and did not notice anything odd except for me
being surprised at the smoother shifts.

Thanks everyone,

Max
'71 Westy "KK-Louise"
