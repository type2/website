Subject: Camping AC placement survey

Quick survey...

I have a 1971 Westfalia and the heat down in Alabama is awful, so I have setup
a 6,500 BTU window-style AC unit to help cool things off while camping.  In
addition to the heat in the main part of the bus, the heat "upstairs" in the
tent section is bad and that is where I have a continental bed setup for my
kids.

The question is this...  Based on the experience of those out on the listserv,
where is the best placement of the AC unit?


A.      Setup the AC in the door of the front cab (similar to

B.      Setup the AC in the luggage rack (like

What do you think?

Thanks,
