Very cool sleep setup for the wee lasses. I haven't seen that sort of rig
before.

So, the question is kind of a combo of where to put the a/c, and how to get
it where you want it... given the density of cooler air and the lack of
insulation in a poptop, I have a hard time thinking you'll get much coolness
up into the top bunk for the gals from a door-mounted a/c, without another
fan setup and some sort of insulation to take advantage of the redirected
cool air, which would be that less cool after being boosted thru another
fan... or maybe that would be cool enough?

Personally, I think getting good circulation from the front doors is tough.
Even if you leave the unit running non-stop, the cooler air has little way
to reach upwards. If you're sleeping "Downtown", it will be comfy, but
"Uptown" will be pretty warm.

Top-mounted has the issue of potentially directly blasting the top bunk -
but you have contol over that, as you can modify how the air enters and
flows into the area, by channeling it with the a/c unit fan, your "boot"
connection feeding the air in, and gravity, even with you limited entry
space. If placing the a/c above, in addition to a boot to carry the air into
the cabin, you'll have to devise a way to channel some to the top bunk, and
the rest below... that could be as simple as devising the equivalent of an
adjustable vent... a tensioned piece of cloth (maybe with some Reflectix
glued to it for rigidity?) directing most but not all of the air down from
the entry point? You might have to play a bit with air direction, but I
think supply from above is still the way to go.

Regardless - Pics of your final setup, or it didn't happen!
