Joe: I absolutely agree and will replace everything that's marginal. I  
will also pull the exhaust system and plane rhe headers to fix an  
exhaust leak. I will also pull the fuel tank for a full treatment.

The trip was an emotional roller coaster, from the high of being back  
at the helm of my beloved bus to the sinking feeling of breaking down  
in largely unpopulated areas. Multiple times.

In the end, though, it's not so much about mechanical problems, but  
about our reaction to them. To some extent, my struggle to keep a cool  
head revealed and tested more about me than about the bus. :)

And I have stories for the grand kids.
