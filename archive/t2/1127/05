I don't see the original post, but only a factory 2.0 will have 3 bolt heads
(not 1.7s or 1.8s), and even a 2.0 in a 914 is often likely now days to have
had the heads culled out by attrition and bus heads and 1.7/1.8 tins in there
with 4 bolt manifolds.  If you do have 3 bolt Porsche heads, and they are
solid and rebuildable, good CORES (that is CORES not rebuilt heads) can fetch
$250-350 each if seats aren't pounded and rebuildable, so toss em on *bay to
fund your rebuild, not into the scrap heap.

The Porsche engine used the 3 bolt intake manifold, so you will need
the manifold that came with it, or keep your Westy heads.
