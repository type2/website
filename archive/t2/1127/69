Hi Michael,

The big question here is HOW you camp. If you tend to stay in one place
for days at a time, then a side tent is a good investment. If you tend to
tour around a lot, then I think your $$$ would be better invested in a
lightweight trailer to tow behind the bus. That lets you relocate your
gear off of the floor and seats and makes the transition from camping to
driving a lot easier; esp. when there are more than two people aboard.

Me, I have both. I camp a LOT in my bus, spending about a month of the
year sleeping in it. Most of that camping is done "on the move", though
there are occasions when I stay in the same place for 4 or 5 nights. Those
are the times when the side tent is at its most useful. But in those cases
I usually also need the trailer; as I tend to haul a lot of gear so as to
keep life interesting and comfortable for myself and my travel companions.

The new BusDepot tent looks to be a pretty good design. I bought one of
their first budget side tents back in 2004 and it has served me well
despite the abuse I have thrown at it. I have even taken it camping to
non-bus events, and no-one there even knew that it was originally designed
for "car camping". Mine was $250 at the time IIRC. I don't regret the
purchase at all.
