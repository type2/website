I'll bet!  I love working on and driving old vehicles but I don't have 
patience for getting left on the side of the road. Especially multiple

Thanks for the thread. You've documented the possible trials and 
tribulations of driving an original ~40 year old vehicle across country 
with hardly any support except your Internet pen-pals. 

It's been an interesting ride from right here in TN and I didn't go 
anywhere.
