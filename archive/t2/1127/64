Subject: Re: [T2] Cause of extreme overheat?

Timing too advanced,
 
fan blockage
 
obstruction infront of the oil cooler
 
missing engine seal/tin
 
oil to low.
 
thermostat flaps shut (broken spring or stuck)
 
 
This happened to my 68  with 1600dp engine bus two years ago. I think mine had
a few causes including the wrong distributor, hole in the engine tin, driving
a 7 hour trip to the mountains without stopping for more than 5min or so,
loose fan belt which eventually broke, and thermostat flaps that were tweaked
at the wrong angle destroyed a rebuilt engine with only around 1000 miles on
it in one trip. It spun a bearing after I threw a fan belt and tried to limp
it to the parts store when I found out my spare was not the right size...
$1700 down the drain. I'm never going to let that happen again.

This is a general knowledge question.


After putting the new parts on he told me that it got really really hot after
maybe 2 min driving, after sitting all night he reset the valves (they were
really tight). He drove it and it happened again, super hot and the valves
tight after sitting another night.

I'm just curious about what 'might' cause a serious overheat, hot enough to
cook the fan belt, melt wires and generally look like the engine was on fire.

Like I said at the beginning this is not my problem but a general knowledge
question at this point.
