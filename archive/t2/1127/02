Hi Bob,

I really preferred it myself because on engine pulls I always have
trouble with the oil filler tube clearing the rear of the body. On the
Porsche engine, the oil filler is on top of the crankcase breather.
There is a small problem with the dip stick also being on top. The
stock dipstick is a bit too stiff to easily check the oil, so I took a
more flexible Vanagon dipstick and cut it and marked it by laying it
against the stock dipstick for measurement.

The Porsche engine used the 3 bolt intake manifold, so you will need
the manifold that came with it, or keep your Westy heads.

John
