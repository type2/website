Subject: Repainting question

Just a quick question for those who know. The old paint on my 77 Westy is
faded but not peeling at all. I know I have to sand it down to get new primer
and paint to "bite" and stay put.
My question is: I have a big scratch on one side that is about 2 feet long and
down to the red primer. Can I just use some glazing putty to build this up to
the level of the old paint before priming, or do I have to sand the whole area
down to blend the scratch right out??
