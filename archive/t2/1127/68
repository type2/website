I preordered one with the separate awning.  I too kept asking myself if
I camp enough to warrant getting one, but the quality seems really nice,
it seems functional, and I decided to splurge.  The list discount
doesn't apply to the pre-sale package price, as it is already
discounted.

And Michael, with as many mods as you're making to the poptop and with
the A/C improvements planned, I think you probably camp enough to get
the tent.  :)
