Jamie,

thanks for chiming in on this!

I've been watching this thread with interest, but the big question 
in my mind has been: "What about the water?"  We spend lots of time/
energy/money trying to stop rust...it seems silly to add more moisture
to the inside of the bus!

So that's why I've been considering staying away from a swamp cooler, esp.
in these humid, Eastern (North American) climes , where you're not going
to get much bang for your buck out of evaporative cooling anyway.

The caveat to all of this is that if the airflow rate is realtively 
low (compared to the volume you're cooling), you might not run into 
a condensation issue.  Then again, you're probably not doing much 
cooling either.

My eventual goal is to design something that takes the edge off.  If 
I can shave 10 degrees off a hot evening/morning, I feel like I've
at least won the battle, if not the war.  The key will be indirect 
cooling...(as opposed to evaporative).

I'll report back after I crunch some numbers and when/if I get started.

Cheers,
   Tom
