well...... someone behind the wheel should have HEARD some pinging if it was
internal engine heat..

sigh
things that come to mind..
is the parking brake on??  do the brakes drag?  *
what is the oil pressure?  **
is there a dipstick wiper rag caught in the intake fan?  ***
What is the timing set at for WOT,, initial.. and how much advance in the
distributor? ****


seems to me there is more history to the problem... like they spun a fan
belt.. cooked the engine.. installed a new fan belt and are still trying to
drive a "blown up" engine..

*        yup, seen a school bus driver forget to take of the hand brake...
drove full throttle,, half clutch until it quit... when I stopped to
exchange vehicles,, and either fix and drive to the garage,, or have it
towed.. under the hood... the air breather was hanging loose.  because the
CARB had gotten soooo HOT.. the actual body of the carb was near liquid..
and the air going into the engine was drawing in alum bits.. like sparkles..
like paint blistering,, and the blister skin being drawn in !  Crank,
flywheel, clutch stuff was soooooo BLUE from heat ... the parking brake was
the same............

**        if the oil pump has failed .. and the pressure is low..  or.. I
have seen a mechanics rag plug the oil pump .. it must have stayed in the
sump corner for miles..then decided to float around till it covered the
screen ....starving the engine for oil pressure

***    same as above.. some folks leave a rag near the dipstick.. and some
unforturnate one find that rag missing... and stuck in the air intake of the
cooling fan.........

****    if the distributor is advancing tooo far at high RPM ... the engine
will get hot
