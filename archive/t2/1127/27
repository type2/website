Glazing puddy should work since the primer is still intact. If the scratch was
down to bare metal, I would recomending sanding it smooth. Just make sure you
clean the area really well with something like rubbing alcohol to get rid or
oil and grime before you apply the glazing puddy. I would be hesitant about
using something stronger like lacquer thinner to clean it because I do not
know if the original primer is just lacquer primer which could disolve with
lacquer thinner or acitone. Rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly unlike using
detergent or degreaser. Cleaning it first will help make sure that the puddy
adhears well. I would also recomend scuffing up the area around the scratch to
make sure that the puddy grabs. If you have never used glazing puddy before,
keep in mind that it does better when you apply a thin coat since it is a one
part puddy. It has to dry out to harden instead of using a chemcal process
like bondo. It dries very quickly, so lay it
 down quickly and try not to mess with it or go over it too many times with
the squeegie or it will roll off. If you apply it too thick, It will take a
long time to dry before you can sand it and it can crack. Good luck.

My question is: I have a big scratch on one side that is about 2 feet long
and
down to the red primer. Can I just use some glazing putty to build this up to
the level of the old paint before priming, or do I have to sand the whole
area
down to blend the scratch right out??
