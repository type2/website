and a general answer...

. serious electrical short causing the generator to overheat and put 
serious load on engine....

. very tight bearing, but wouldn't allow engine to start.

. did they even put a fan on the hub, or tightening the bolts meaning it 
slips

. the question is the engine overheating, or is it not cooling.  could be 
big difference.

why are valves tightening up???

sounds like he didn't break in the engine properly, or it wasn't properly 
built.

but they drove it 10k miles before this happened so something "happened"


strange but nothing surprises me with these old things.  seems like 
everytime I think I have mine tweaked right, something else finds a way to 
drive me nuts....
