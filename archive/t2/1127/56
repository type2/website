Subject: could it be the coil?

'78 2L, FI on a short ride today running down a slight hill alt light comes on 
and indeed it died. Ignition off and then she cranked and started, happened 3 
more times on this 3 mile ride, would not re-start by compression, I had to turn 
the key off and crank it. each time she started right up like nothing was wrong. 
Any ideas?
