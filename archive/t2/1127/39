I actually wouldn't mind this at all.  It's kinda annoying getting 
double messages all the time because people are using reply all - and 
likewise when people don't know to use reply-all and you don't know if 
they meant to send it to you or the list.  I understand it's there to 
keep un-needed traffic down, but I don't think the list traffic is much 
of an issue.

I'd vote yes to have reply-to go straight to the list.

thanks,
Mike
