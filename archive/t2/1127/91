Subject: re:tough gauge install

Well I went back at it after sending that email about installing the three
gauge cluster under the radio. 

Here are some suggestions for anyone doing this in the future...

1. I would probably install a wiring block somewhere for this install. I
tried jumping from one gauge to the next. This probably made it harder. Time
permitting I will install two wiring blocks in the future- one for power
when engine is running, and one for lights. Then each gauge will run to
that. I think this would clean up the wiring nest I think I just created.
These blocks should probably get fuses, I'll have to read up on how to do
that.

2. Try to just drill a 2" hole in the padding, then switch to 2 1/8" for the
metal, or maybe 2 1/16". This way the foam will grab and hold the gauge
pretty good, but the larger hole in the metal, will allow for some play in
adjusting gauge location/alignment etc.

3. Think about the ash tray. I don't see how to get mine back in there. If I
figure it out, I'll let you know. But now I don't have an ash tray-which was
my change drawer. If anyone else has done this and can get the ash tray back
in-please let me know how

4. A few folks warned about putting the gauges in this location-as they are
not at a natural angle to view. I believed that. I went that  route because
I already had a gauge there by PO, and didn't want to be looking at two
different locations for info. If I do it again, I would probably go on top
of the dash-either right in front or off to the right angled towards driver.

Now I'll see what feedback I get driving the bus, and compare to what I've
read in the archives...hopefully my bus is currently running ok.
