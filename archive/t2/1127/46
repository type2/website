ok.. you didn't say what engine .... but I'll repeat the words of wizdom
said to me as I was signing my contract to start as an apprentice mechanic
at an aircooled rebuild shop

ALWAYS use heat on the head studs... never "try" to see if they will
move...........  if you break a head stud ,, your fired.

.....    where there is a bolt and a nut.. you can snap them off with no
concerns... but where there is a stud.. you don't want to bugger it up ....
unless you like drilling and tapping.

some folks like to heat the nuts.. and wick parafin wax on them to lubricate
the threads..
