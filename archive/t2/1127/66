Has anyone checked-out the new Add-A-Room tent that Bus Depot has...
http://busdepot.com/details/addaroom.jsp

I keep going back and forth about buying an add-on tent for my 71 Westy.  The
cost of $400 always has me saying, "Do we camp enough?"  In any event, I was
wondering if I could get some feedback from the group.  Also, I know, at one
time, Bus Depot gave discounts to listserv members.

Ideas?  Feedback?

Thanks,

Michael in Montevallo
