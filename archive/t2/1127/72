Hi,

I also have one of the previous models, purchased in 2008 I think... I
waffled for a few weeks when the special offer came up. It has turned out to
be well worth the coin for anyone travelling either with a Woman who needs
lots of comforts, or Kids, or both!  If you're parking for a weekend or
longer, it is great to have. Mine is well made, versatile, and offers great
space, and a little privacy room for changing out of bathing suits etc. I
can throw some pics up somewhere if anyone is interested.
