Hi Michael,

Here's some...

http://plaza.ufl.edu/mikerule/VW/camping/

The model I have is The Spacemaker... more space than two folks need, but
great for 3-6 folks.  My main complaint with it is the poor "connection" to
the bus. It just doesn't sync up well to the sliding door opening, so I have
to cover the gaps using tiny plastic clips and an old cloth tapestry I have
- keeps the bugs out anyway. Otherwise, it's been a worthy purchase - it's
really quite a well-made tent. Looking forward to pics of your final a/c
setup. Cheers, Mike
