We have the previous incarnation of the tent.  We've yet to attach it to the
bus, since the bus has been undergoing a restoration for the last 18 months
(that's about the most pleasant way I can put it).

We really like the tent, in that it is a ton of space in a smallish footprint
(you can stand up in the entire tent).  We're still learning ways to make our
trips better by maximizing ventilation and such.  Our first real (not in the
backyard) campout was very memorable, with 65 mph winds and hail.  We were at
a music festival (DelFest 2009) and about 1/2 of the tents at the festival
were shredded.  Even though we didn't properly put up the tent, it withstood
the assault of the weather.  It is very well made.

The huge downside of the tent is that it is a solid 1/2 hour to set up with 2
people.  The newer one claims to cut this time in half, which is essential.  I
agree with Greg P, that I wouldn't set this type of tent up if I wasn't going
to camp for at least 2 nights.
