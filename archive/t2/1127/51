Subject: Re: [T2] Re: stranded in Wichita Falls, TX

Indeed, well observed. The original issue that started this thread was  
the sudden rumbling noise and loss of power in Wichita Falls. One  
possibility suggested by Davis is that the noise was caused by the  
flapper box coming loose, just hanging by the cable  and bopping on  
the rotating half shaft. I'm not sure how to explain the power loss,  
but recall that it was temporary. So I cannot exclude the possibility  
of tainted observation.

And as you said, there's still the bucking. Ben spent less than an  
hour and did not claim to have found all the issues. And he didn't  
charge me :)
