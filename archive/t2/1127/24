I havn't read the entire thread.. but a thought that came to mind....   most
folks have heard .. Man.. how do you stand the Heat?!?... and the reply
is...... oh ,, it is a dry heat !
that is to say,, you can stay comfortable as long as it isn't humid.

Swamp coolers [evap a/c] are just that because they make you feel like you
are in a wet slimy atmosphere similar to a cold swamp unless the area is
very dry like arizona.

Soo..... to look at the A/C installed in a camper...  the hot humid air from
the camper MUST be pulled out, thru the condensor coils ,,, cooled, and
dehumidified... and put back in ......

If you just blow cold air into the camper... and are in a humid area.....
then you will end up with condensation on the fibreglass roof... windows...
and exposed [not insulated] metal panels of the vehicle...... as well as
YOUR skin... yuck!

now.. that said .. it is from theory. ,, not practise,, as i live in an
airconditioned country, lol

I saw a LOT of a/c installed in campers at BNNTA ... and iirc , there was
quite a number that installed them in the drivers door window.  very easy to
do,, just like and old hamburger place did with the food tray... A&W ..

one thing I did pick up from watching those installations ...... make sure
the condensate drain is outside the bus! ... lol .... if you are parked on
an angle and the A/C unit tips towards the inside... the drain may fill your
camper with water!

keep cool!
