Subject: RE: [T2] Camping AC placement survey

OK.  I was pretty much content with only cooling the bus while camping but now
David has got my wheels turning (very dangerous).

First of all, I really dislike the idea of cutting into the bus to make such
modifications BUT the idea of using the stock vents and using an assist
generator has its merits.  Recalling how many have pulled a small trailer
behind their buses for everything from just holding those extra items in the
bus to actually hauling gasification systems, I am thinking that the generator
might could be mounted in a small trailer (or even the luggage rack, as
suggested).  Next, what about using the duct system in reverse, similar to how
the heat gets to the bus and placing an AC unit somewhere inconspicuous and
ducting to that system?

Just some other ideas to pop around.
