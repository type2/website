Subject: Small amount of Brown Plaid needed

Does anyone have approximately 18" square of the brown plaid for a 78
Westfalia that they would be willing to give/sell to me?

We need to replace the fabric on the top of the stool, as the PO's must have
been smoking something a few times and there are a handful of cigarette burns
in it.

Thanks!

Jeremy
