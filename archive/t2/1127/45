Subject: Rusty exhaust

Hey folks-

  My engine's out, so there's lots of things to do (I've been doing a
full resto, for those who have no idea who I am).  The first thing I'd
like to do is take the whole exhaust system off and (at the very least)
clean it up.  I'm pretty sure this is the original motor, and the
exhaust is pretty rusty.  I'm pretty sure that it's so rusty that these
bolts and nuts on the exhaust are just going to break off if I start
cranking on them.

  Anyone have opinions on how I should go about this?  It sounds like a
new exhaust is going to be pricey, but I'm concerned that the current
one might not only be unservicable, but also more a hinderance than
anything while I do my engine work (with the help of the usual
manuals...)
