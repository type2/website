Subject: RE: [T2] Camping AC placement survey

Thank you all for your feedback.  It has been most helpful.

I have also posted a poll/discussion on The Samba for feedback and ideas
related to this topic.

The entire issue will, undoubtedly, revolve around sleeping arrangements with
my kids (8 & 9 years old).  I constructed a continental bunk up top that is
working well and will probably get us through at least this year.  As such, I
will probably keep the AC in the driver's cab window and augment with a fan(s)
to get the cold air up top.  In the meantime, I think the luggage rack idea
will work well and will try to construct the apparatus over the next couple of
months (just in time, hopefully, for things to cool off anyway).

Thanks again everyone,

Michael in Montevallo
