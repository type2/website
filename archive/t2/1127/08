Subject: Cheap painting technique

With mention on type2 of paint prep, etc, I figured mentioning a tip/technique
I saw on "Power Block" a couple weeks ago.  Now I have several HVLP guns, have
painted for a long time, and although a cheap small gun (Sharp Cobalt would be
my choice, or even cheaper one of Harbor Freights "better" guns) and small
compressor can be had for probably $300-350 or so, to eek by, they were using
something a bit interesting.  I have no personal experience here obviously,
just passing on what I watched.  They bought the premixed Dupli-Color auto
paint most parts stores carry now and shot it with a $40, 110V electric paint
gun, the sort you stain your deck with.  They were not looking for a great
result (beater offroad truck) but actually got a much better surface than I
expected they would.  If you are in a pinch and need to do something cheap, it
looks like an interesting idea and would beat rattle cans all to hell.  I've
said it before in high school we
 painted a buddies Blazer with auto paint, brushes, then did a lot of color
sanding and buffing, and it looked quite reasonable.  I think using one of
these then color sanding and buffing would give a quite acceptable result,
certainly up to Earl Scheib quality.  But I've never done it, just saw it on
TV.  I do have a slight concern in my mind about the 110V powered thing and
solvent thinned paint, as far as explosion risk though, so YMMV.
