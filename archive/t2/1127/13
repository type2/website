cool air source pour in from above, in a somehwat central location, seems to
cool and circulate more than trying to move air sideways and back from one
of the front doors. It's the plan I intend to use, if I ever master my $20
sewing machine enough to create a boot to channel the a/c air in, like what
was linked.



The question is this...  Based on the experience of those out on the
