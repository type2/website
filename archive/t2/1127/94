Hey Mike, thanks for the great pics.

It  looks like the screw on pieces that attach behind the dash are much
longer on mine. Maybe I can cut mine. I was worried about cutting them and
having them split or crack.

I had thought of your idea of putting a piece of wood behind the gaugesand
that is probably the way I will end up going. If I do that, I was thinking
about cutting the wood at an angle-so the gauges are angled towards the
driver a bit.

What sort of bracket did you use for the radio? My radio sags too, but it is
not what gets in the way of the gauges. My longest gauge is the tach. It
goes in the left hole(as originally given to me) The other two gauges are
the same length.

What year is your bus? I wonder if that has anything to do with it?

I have seen a '71 dash that I can pick up locally, that appears to be decent
condition. I'm just not sure if it will fit a '69. Do you know about the
interchangeability of dashes?

Hi Kevin,

I checked mine - it looks like I just got lucky with the depth of my
gauges...

I'm sure you've thought of this - but does the center gauge the longest
depth?  Could you move it to the side spot to clear the ashtray?
If you notice, my radio hangs, and was sitting on the gauges and ashtray
until I used a bracket to lift the arse end up a bit... is your radio
pressing the gauge(s) down?

The only other idea I came up with is using the front plate as a template,
and cut a piece of wood to mount behind the plate, on/ in front of the dash
(sanded and painted to match) as a spacer to move the gauges forward until
they clear the ashtray... good luck man. mike


3. Think about the ash tray. I don't see how to get mine back in there. If I
figure it out, I'll let you know. But now I don't have an ash tray-which was
my change drawer. If anyone else has done this and can get the ash tray back
in-please let me know how
