Subject: tough gauge install

Well based on list wisdom and advice, I have skipped the Cylinder Head Temp
gauge for now, and installed a oil pressure and oil temp gauge. The PO had
already installed a tach in the dash between the radio and the ashtray.

I know a few suggested alternate locations for gauges, but I saw the three
hole trim panel that fits neatly right where the existing tach is. So I
figured I have one hole already, and there are two gouges near it(left over
screw holes maybe?) so I'll drill two more holes and get all three gauges
in.

1st challenge, finding a 2- 1/16" hole saw. That took a little searching.
Then I drilled the holes-this saw did not do nearly as clean a job as the
hole by the PO. But it should all be covered by the trim plate.

Next run wiring - I had some leftover 16 gauge wire (4 wires all bundled
together). I liked this because if I wanted to run anything else to or from
the engine compartment, I'd already have the wires there. 

Then came the hard part-trying to get the gauges in the holes. The tach fits
ok on the left. I had to sand the trim panel out a bit, as the gauge was
slightly larger than 2 -1/16". The center gauge hits the ashtray, not sure
how to deal with that yet. The right gauge fits, but I can't get the
connector to thread onto the back. I've been hacking away at the hole with a
dremel, but don't want to get so big that the trim panel doesn't cover it.

Anyone else who installed one of these have any tips?
