Congrats on your arrival.

That's the trouble with intermittent issues. You can't be sure they
have been fixed until you give it some road time. I figure if it's not
fixed, you don't owe.

That will take a bite out of the dealer charge.

 hooks me up with "Ben", the foreman who trained in Germany with BMW, VW, and
 Mercedes. Of course the bus looked out of place among 5, 6, and 7 series,
 but it was a pleasure watching Ben methodically go over the bus. Diagnostic:
 the rubber elbow at the auxiliary air regulator was cracked, allowing air
 into the intake manifold, in particular on a cold engine when the regulator
 is open.

3 cheers for Ben! How nice it is to have a brother in the VW family!
Of course, what Ben found could have been found at the VW dealer. Nice
to see Ben working in a methodical way. And a good lesson for the rest
of us. I surely wouldn't have thought of looking at that elbow with
the symptoms you were having!
