Subject: Engine install alignment problem - 1975 F.I. Bay

Im trying to reinstall the engine in my daughters 1975 FI Bay but am
having a problem aligning the transmission carrier mount bolt holes and the
nose mount. With no nuts on the mustache mount bolts, the nuts on the engine
mounts to mustache bar and the nuts at the nose cone are just finger tight -
I just cant get the transmission carrier mount bolt holes to line up.

See transmission carrier mount:	http://tinyurl.com/266tgo7
See nose mount:				http://tinyurl.com/273ut2h

Could someone look at the mustache bar photos and let me know if I used the
correct set of holes? If I used the other set of holes, that would move the
engine to the right which would be in the right direction but I dont think
that would be correct.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks - Steve
