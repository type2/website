Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Adjustment

That means that you had too much free play and when you pushed in the
clutch, there was not enough throw on the pedal to fully disengage the
clutch.

The free play at the top means the clutch is fully engaged. No free
play means the clutch is not getting a full grip.
