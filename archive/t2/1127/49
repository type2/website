Sami - I would suggest you find some time to pull the engine and go 
through the long block. Inspect everything. Replace gaskets. Clean the 
fins. Clean the cooler. Adjust everything. The cost might only be a 
gasket kit and a few rubber things.

I do this when I buy aircooled VWs so that I'm not chasing multiple 
quirks. This enables me to get it all on the garage floor and see it 
from all the angles. I find when an engine has three or four problems it 
gets difficult to figure out what ails it.

I would have been a pretty frustrated VW driver after your trip! GRIN! 
When things are in good condition I've found Beetles and Buses to be 
reliable though needing more attention more often than a new watercooled 
car (needs more adjustments, tuning,  and some parts last a shorter 
time). They do put up with alot of neglect to a point.

I'm glad you made it.  You'll chuckle and reminisce about that trip for 
years to come! I drove from Naples to Venice in a 1200cc Super Beetle. 
Lost the clutch near Pisa and had a very trying afternoon when the job 
should have taken 45 mins. Turns out I bent the two lower engine studs 
and I could not get the input shaft to lineup. We still tallk about that 
trip.
