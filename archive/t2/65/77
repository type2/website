Well I want to buy a meter (Ohm/ammeter ?) to help troubleshoot problems I
might have with FI, wiring, instruments, AFM, ECU. Does anyone have any
preferences/suggestions on which one to get? Please explain why you prefer
it (sorry, I want the reason why you like it too). This will be for my 1980
Westy primarily.

I was looking at some nice units at a new Checker Auto Parts just down the
street.
