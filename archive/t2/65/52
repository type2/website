Subject: Dizzy removal


So I have been planning to go back to the OEM dizzy on my 78 Westy. I have
an 009 now, and through the list (via a direct response :-) ) I was able to
swap pertronix with another listee so I now have a vac advance pertronix.
My problem is the OEM dizzy is stuck in my spare engine. Engine has 90K on
it and has been sitting under cover for about 7 years. The dizzy advance
plate moves, the vac can seems OK, BUT I cannot get it out of the engine. I
can spin the dizzy in the clamp if I POUND on it, I'm hitting it on the vac
can mount area so the dizzy body stays round. I have tried prying it up at
the mounting strap/bolt thing and the body but access to it isn't great.
Any suggestions? Could I use some kind of puller?

PS: Karl, I was asking my mechanic about this and he said the sweet set up
was the 79 CA dizzy with module which he happens to have if I want it. :-)
If i go that way I will buy it from him as he's asking the same price and
he will supply tech support :-)
