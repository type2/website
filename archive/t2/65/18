Bessie: Our Grateful Dead Bus--
http://www.livingfolklore.com/HTML/bessie.htm
Which we found in pieces in Jerome years ago and is now "Back On the Glory
Road"  Todate I have never been "Stopped" while on the road--I Actually have
received a lot of Thoumbs Up and "Vs" from the Law People!! Bessie even has
painting of Garcia on the one side-- I do have "Veteran Plates" on Bessie as
that might help--Also Every light is in working order--I Left Chicago in
1979 so "uj" was not at the last GD Concert--I was at a lot of concerts in
Evanston and Grant Park --Hendrickx,Joplin,Jefferson,Sly,BB,Etc.-- was able
to catch a lot of the greats--
Just received our Limited Edtiton of the Matchbox Bus with the graphics of
Bessie on both sides!! Very Kool--stay tuned for photos--keep on truckin--
TWWM , uj
