Subject: rust removal & paint job???

hello all,

ok, so currently my 76 Westy is wearing only primer.
Yikes! i'm not pleased to say the least. apparently
the PO had removed a fair ammount of surface rust from
the body and only felt the need to put primer back on.
funny thing is he primered the whole dang thing,
bumpers and all. it looked alright when i bought it,
but now it has been raining often and some of the
surface rust is starting to return. i plan to have
some body panels replaced soon, and then i would like
to remove any remaining surface rust(it's worst in the
rain gutters and on the front nose) and get some color
on it, both for aesthetic and protective purposes. i
plan to do this myself. what should i use to get the
rust off? is there a procedure , or way this is done?
does anyone have any direction or guidance for me. i
would appreciate any and all experiences or advice.
thanks much.

Matty
76 Westy "Cleopatra"
