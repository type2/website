Subject: Re: [T2] rust removal & paint job???

The reason the primer is rusting is the main ingrediants in primer are
clay, and talic----which hold moisture.
It rains out, the primer holds the moisture, causing the underlying
metal to rust.

I would approach the problem like ths----get a 6" air obital sander ( a
DA ) and run it over the whole body with 180 paper, and seal off the
sanded area with two part epoxy sealer / primer.

This will hold off the metal corrosion, until it's time to paint.

Happy sanding----

E-mail message From Matty=A0Kirk--- 

hello all, 
ok, so currently my 76 Westy is wearing only primer. Yikes! i'm not
pleased to say the least. apparently the PO had removed a fair ammount
of surface rust from the body and only felt the need to put primer back
on. funny thing is he primered the whole dang thing, bumpers and all. it
looked alright when i bought it, but now it has been raining often and
some of the surface rust is starting to return. i plan to have some body
panels replaced soon, and then i would like to remove any remaining
surface rust(it's worst in the rain gutters and on the front nose) and
get some color on it, both for aesthetic and protective purposes. i plan
to do this myself. what should i use to get the rust off? is there a
procedure , or way this is done? does anyone have any direction or
guidance for me. i would appreciate any and all experiences or advice.
thanks much. 
Matty
