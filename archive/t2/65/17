Subject: Cold breeze

I have replaced all of the seals on my Westy. The doors, and both rear 
hatches, and all of the pop top seals. It was around 36 degrees yesterday and 
it was actually warm in the bus until I got above 40mph. Then this ice cold 
breeze starts coming in through the pop top. 

There was some cold air coming before I replaced the seal, but now it is 
worse with a new seals.

It seems the top is not as snug as it was before, like the seal is propping 
it up. 

Any thoughts on how to fix this or at least block the air? I would like to be 
able to drive faster the 40mph and still not freeze.

Thanks
