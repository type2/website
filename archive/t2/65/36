I always use a pump as well... well, almost always.... I had "an
adventure" many years ago where I hadda add fluid to a (new to me) bus on
the road and if you have a hose for siphoning gas and a friend (or father)
you trust, you can thread the hose thru the firewall to the trans and have
the friend pour from up top while you keep your finger in the hole to
check the fluid level :-)
