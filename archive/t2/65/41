Bob, it is right here in Colorado Springs, CO... used to be part of Rocky 
Mountian Motor Works a few years back, then was sold and moved into town from 
Woodland Park where RMMW has their warehouse.

I figure you will get a few replies from those of use out here in the 
Springs.  I have to say good words for them, they were the only place that 
could get me a rear brake spreader bar for my '71 when my old one was rusted 
out a couple of years back.

'78 Westy, with new Jamie River's trailer hitch... sweeet
