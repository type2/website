Subject: Funky White Stag tent on Eb*y

This is not a style I've seen before, and I'm not exactly sure how it mates to the vehicle.  Could it be a generic tent?

Look for item #598865864 on eb*y motors.  It's not a "Westy Tent" by any stretch, but it's interesting.  Anyone know more about this model?

ONE day I'll be updating the tent pages with this and other info I've gathered in the past few months.  I need to completely redo that site.  Any day now.  Heh heh.  
Sure.
