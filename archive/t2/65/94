Jeff, there's one minor problem here: When I hit "reply" on my e-mail
program (both MS Outlook Express and MS Entourage for Mac do this) only the
sender's address shows up in the "send to" field. Clicking "reply all" puts
both the sender and the Type 2 list in the "send to" field.

It's always done this, both on the old server and on this one.

Can this be fixed?
