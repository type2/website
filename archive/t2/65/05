Subject: more stuff on the Dead

earlier someone mentioned that they saw large vehicles with half bus bodies
& other contraptions welded onto the top.  i witnessed this also at a
show in Charlotte, NC on Fall tour '94 (i think). 

it was truly a "mad scientist" type of setup.  i loved it. 
i spoke with the 2 guys who apparently
did most of the work.  they took the upper half of 2 bus bodies & welded
them onto the roof of a full-size school bus.  i didnt get a good 'tour'
of the interior, but from what i could see they had sleeping quarters for
ALOT of folks, as well as window mounted AC units & other wacky stuff.

sorry i just couldnt resist jumping in on this thread also!
lets clear up a little confusion that i have seen on some of the responses
to the original post:

>>"They didn't shake people down for cameras and tape recorders--
you could even plug your tape recorder into the console
 for the very highest quality recordings."<<

AFAIK they did not allow cameras into their shows.  & the taping policy
was not as lax as "bring in your tape recorder & plug it into the soundboard".
i'm sure near the beginning of the Dead that they had a policy much like that,
but later on the taping guidelines became very strict.  while the Dead did know
that spreading their music in this fashion would lead to more fans, they
were also concerned with other parties making money on these "free" live recordings.

>>"I went to see the Dead in 94 at Soldier field.<snip> And I believe it was Uncle Jerry's last Chicago
performance."<<

the last & final Dead show was in fact at Soldier Field, but was on 7/9/95.

while i am a total deadhead i think its important to remember that just because a person
owns a bus it doesnt make them one also.  i personally dont mind the stigma attached to
buses that makes people think of hippies, the Dead, etc. - but i'm sure there are
plenty of bus drivers out there who dont want to be associated with that.

sorry for the long post/rant,
