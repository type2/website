Subject: Slider Hinge Link Assembly

Hiya All,

The hinge link assembly (1970 Bus) on the rear of my sliding door is kaput.  The spring appears to be broken and the whole unit is making grumbling sounds when the door is moved.  Looks like it's time for a new one.
So..............the question is:  Is the hinge link assembly a universal part for 68-79?  Which is to say, are they all interchangeable?  If not which years are compatible?  
As always, thanks for giving your knowledge to the needy!

Mike
