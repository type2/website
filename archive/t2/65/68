Subject: oil psi

VW afficianados,
A friend of mine recently took her 78 westy to the shop and they attributed 
the majority of her oil leaks to the oil pressure switch not being torqued 
in enough. what kind of oil pressure does a 2.0 L generate? this is not 
urgent, i am just curious how much pressure would be pushing upwards towards 
that switch and the threads that hold it in?
-Jeremy
