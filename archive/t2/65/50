I would prefer if people posted responses to questions to the list only,
not both the list and the questioner, unless people request a direct
response. This accomplishes 2 things:
1: The answer is archived so it can be found in searches. I hate when a
search turns up more question like my question, then answers.
2: It isolates everybody. Now that viruses are using the sent mail to
propagate, if you always answer to the list, then using the list CAN NOT
propagate viruses.

Now I'll go on to say that I have sent direct responses when I felt my
response might not be as helpful and bus related as the list might need.
Obviously this is a judgement call for each person and we can only hope if
people here have the good judgement to own busses they will apply this good
judgement to other things :-)
