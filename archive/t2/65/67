Subject: windshield chip repairs

I have a couple tiny chips in my windshield. Are those
$10 spot fixes that glass shops offer a good deal? I'd
like to do something before the freeze/thaw conditions
spreads a big crack.

I had a chip fixed on my MbZ and it's held up through
two winters. (It's also almost invisible.)

But the shop makes you sign an "ungarantee" that says
it is possible the repair process will destroy your
window or fail to stop the crack from spreading. I'd
hate to see my 33-year-old windshreen crumble before
my eyes.
