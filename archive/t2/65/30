Just wondering if there was something missing, that's all.  I didn't want a deluxe.  Actually I would prefer a poptop weekender arrangement, perhaps with a rear facing jumpseat (68-73 westy?) or two in place of the kitchen cabinetry all together.  I'll cook outside, thanks.  And a cooler can be removed when necessary.  Anyone need an icebox or sink cabinet?
