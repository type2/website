People,
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you to post virus warnings to the list.  This is
the type2 e-mail list, for discussion of VW Buses and Buses only.
If you want to educate yourself about viruses I'm sure you can find many
resources on the internet, not the least of which would be www.symantec.com.
If you are operating a computer this day and age and you don't have some
kind of antivirus software, you pretty much deserve what you get.  We don't
all need to hear about it.

If you use Microsoft products and you don't keep the software updates
current (windowsupdate.microsoft.com) then you also deserve what you get.

If you haven't gotten it through your head by now that you should not open
attachments unless they are expected and you have scanned them through some
antivirus software, then you also deserve what you get.  I mean gimme a
break, it's not like viruses are a new thing.  And lately they are pretty
much ALL done as attachments through e-mail.

You will not get a virus through the list.  The list is configured such that
virus will not propagate to all the subscribers.  If you get a virus from a
listmember, that listmember had you in his/her address book or sent it to
you directly, not through the list.  That's an issue you need to take up
with that listmember.  DO NOT post it to the list.

The other component of this policy is that many virus warnings that get
posted are hoaxes which of course no one bothers to check out.  "If I saw it
on the Internet, it must be true."  <-- if this is your philosophy, you
probably should not post at all, just on principle.

Virus warning posts will result in immediate and permanent removal from the
list.  Yeah, this is a nasty e-mail but frankly I don't know how else I can
say it or how many more times I have to say it before it sinks in.
