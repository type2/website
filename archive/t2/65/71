I can see where that would work, but the only problem is keeping my little 
one warm.

Speaking of heat (and this may be a silly question), but with a regular 
transporter there is a pull-knob under the driver's seat that allows heat to 
flow into the rear of the bus. On a camper, what happens to the heat if you 
pull that knob?

With the 68-73 models, you got the jump seat behind the driver, and the 
sink/fridge behind the passenger seat. For the '74 and later models the 
camper-stuff moves around but I still think the air vents are blocked. Is 
the knob just for looks, or is there some free heat that we're losing out 
on?
