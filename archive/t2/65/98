Joe,
     That tent I believe is a little later model than my White Stag side 
tent, mine is circa 1969. I believe these tents were made in Portland, Ore, 
hence it just made sense for Rivera, in Beaverton to use them.  I don't know 
when Riviera went out of business, the latest Rivera I've owned was a '77. 
(this is a good Jim Arnot question) 
     They seem to have their tent set up different, compared to mine.  Mine 
uses crossed side poles, and minus the side window shape, my tent is 
identical.  Not crossing the poles would explain the left over poles. As for 
attaching it to the Bus, they had snaps on the bottom rocker, and used a 
steel rod in the rain gutter.  As for staking it down, they came with red 
plastic tent stakes.  
     Joe, I've enjoyed you web site in the past, so I honestly don't remember 
how much info I've gleamed from you.  So here's a big thanks for the work you 
do maintaining your site.
     I would also like to pass along that I scored my tent for $150 US. Here 
locally in Eugene, Or., that seems to be the going price.  I'll do my 
damnedest to send some pics your way next time mines set up. 
                                                                              
    Peace,
