Comin' through NJ soon?
If you're up to it, how 'bout a note to the list when you come across a 
"find"?
And on a similar note...A while back, I kept passing a bike leaning against a
wall in a back yard. I left a note on it saying I was interested...Talked to a
neighbor and left another note in the mailbox of the purported owner...
Couple weeks later, I notice the bike's gone. I ask the neighbor what hap-
pened...Seems the owner wasn't paying the rent on the apartment and left
rather hurriedly one night leaving quite a bit of "stuff"...The landlord hired
some local help and they "threw" the bike into a dumpster along with the con-
tents of the apartment...The bike? Norton Commando 8-(
