!!That's too high!  I know what the weather is like in Texas and fully agree 
with the use of 20/50 oil for summer time use.  But you should really switch to 
something a little lighter for the winter.

Ah.  Now I see what's up.  Your conversion for bar to psi is wrong.  One bar is 
approximately equal to 14.5 psi (not the 18 that you are using).  So your 6-bar 
gauge will measure up to about 87 psi.  What you think is 55-65 is probably 
more like 44-52 psi and your 35-40 is 28-32.  These are actually very good 
pressures and are not nearly as scary as what Stan stated.
