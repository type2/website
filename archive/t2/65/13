Subject: FI vs. Progressive carb

Hi listee gurus-

Scored a nice wrecked bus with a newly rebuild 2.0 that I am planning 
on installing in my 73 panel.  I don't personally have a strong 
preference either way, but I was wondering about the pros and cons of 
FI versus a Webber set up.  I have a 2 bbl Webber carb and manifold 
off of a 1.7 that would probably work.

Obvioously, the install would be easier with the carb set up, but if 
the FI is significantly better in either reliability or performance, 
I would retain it.

Suggestions?
