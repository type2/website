Subject: Type 2 Parts Quest

I keep seeing posts on rare parts finds, discovery of new junk yards, etc.
Thought I might mention what I do on this end to achieve same functionality.

I have a small spiral bound not pad that I keep in the tool box. It lists 
everything I am constantly on the quest for, and even lists part numbers in 
some cases.

This past year, as Mary Beth and I did over 21,000 miles of Western US, 
Canada, and Alaska in Casper, I discovered quite a few old buses parked out 
in abandoned house locations, on small lonely roadways going through small 
towns way out in nowhere, etc.

As a result, for all but free, I glommed onto..............
Vac Advance Distributors
that very elusive (perfect) screen mesh for the nose of the bus
spare light assemblies,
fuse boxes and covers.
small bits and pieces of unique hardware and fasteners.
interior camping light assembly,
etc.

Having my "want" list readily at hand in the tool box kept me from being 
overwhelmed by the "new" old bus discovery, and put my mind back to track 
on exactly what I would like to look for on the bus.

The sad part of my trip was seeing all these buses way out in remote-ville 
and knowing that there were a lot of items others could use, but there 
would be almost no way to justify a several thousand mile trip just to 
retrieve same. You would not believe the gas heaters I found in old 
abandoned buses up in Alaska......... Some were in dern near new to 
excellent condition just waiting to be pulled and used.
