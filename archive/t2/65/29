Your friend at the boneyard is correct for removing the hinge from a dead
bus.  Whether he is correct for the installation end depends on how
successful you are at getting the one off the dead bus without kinking the
cover over the track.  As you remove it, regard it as a practice piece and
be as careful as you will be when installing.  Some people can do this,
some cannot.  Depends on how good you are at spatial relationships.  A
further clue is that there is a slot cut in the track under the cover that
lets the roller and then the slider block loose from the track.  examine
all the possibilities, take your time and he will prove correct.

A "philosophy point"....  when I am operating in a junkyard, I tend to
regard the vehicles that I am removing parts from as if they were my bus.
I save every screw that I remove, and i try very hard to remove pieces
peacefully.  There are multiple reasons for this...

the screw you save may be the one at is missing/stripped on your bus;

the part you destroy while taking the part you need off the donor may be
the part you destroy when installing that part on your bus, and you have
just ruined a part you will be desperate for tomorrow;

the practice in carefully removing the part will come to your rescue when
you install the part.  99% of the time installation is truly the reverse
of removal on VWs.

it's just plain respect for the businessman running the yard.  He is
trying to make a living off those parts and you are cheating him by buying
a $10 mirror that you destroyed a $50 door to remove.
