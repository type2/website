Subject: Re: [T2] Cold breeze

What year is your Westy? I'm trying to figure out a way to set-up a sheet or 
something that will prevent the heat from being sucked out through the back 
of the roof.

I know it's a little different from what your problem is, but I solved one 
of the the cold breezes in mine by simply pulling the curtains to. Makes it 
a little hard to see sometimes, but it made a pretty big difference this 
past weekend.
