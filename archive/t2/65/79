Probably no more than 70-80psi when the engine is cold.  The shop could be 
correct, as the pipe threads in the oil pressure switch fitting are tapered 
and rely on torque to make a seal.  I would be very careful about 
overtorquing though, as this one would be a bear to fix if the threads 
stripped or the sender snapped off.
