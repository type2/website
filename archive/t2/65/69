That stuff isn't supposed to be good lubricant, it isn't supposed to last
3000 miles, it is just to get an old rag off your used car lot or take
advantage of some poor snook buying his first car.
What other reason would anyone spend $50.00 for enough oil to fill a 4.5
quart oil pan.
I only sent it because I thought you guys would get a laugh out of it.
