Exactly.

I had a high mileage $150 CR-X when i was in the service and was travelling 
back and forth between VA and TN to see my girlfriend.

Didn't want to be adding oil ever gas stop.

Tried it - figured at $150 for the whole car I didn't have much to lose.

Like I said before it worked - for a while - but I think it may have led to 
more problems as the smoke volume SEEMED to increase quickly after the 
first couple of times.

Yes - it did lead to a sludge in the oil pan.

I kept the oil changed regularly. That was the best damn cheap car I ever 
owned. My buddy bought it from the base junkyard in Naples for $50. Did a 
tuneup and drove it for ~3 years. Sold it to me for what he had in it 
($150) and once stateside again I put another 20K miles on it (more or 
less). I never did anything to it either.

Traded it for a $1K Hyundai (yuck) that needed $100 of repairs. Sold that 
one too. Wish I found more deals like those.
