It's The Unscrupulous Used Car Dealer's Best Friend, Chris. Dump a bottle or
two into the worst smoker and she looks like she's got a nice tight engine.
Slap you a "As Is-No Warranty" sign in the window and you have something to
point to when the worn-out engine finally lets go in three weeks. Yes, a
quick oil analysis will quickly show that No Smoke Motor Oil Additive is in
there, but anyone who'd buy a car with an engine full of Motor Honey isn't
going to know about oil analysis either.
