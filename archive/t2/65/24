Just wanted to warn everyone on the list. I got email from my brother this 
morning with no text and an attachment Card.doc.pif. I downloaded it on my 
desktop and when I double clicked it, the icon disappeared. I heard later in 
the day from him that his computer is infected with a virus that sent 
everyone in his address book the same thing. Many came back as undeliverable 
as they apparently were detected by some systems.
A couple of weeks ago, I got a suspicious email with "clunking noise" in the 
subject line, apparently related to a query I had made to the type2 list in 
regards to ball joints. There was no text and an attached file that ended 
with ".pif." I deleted that one but my suspicions were lulled this morning by 
the return address of a sibling and coffee that was in the cup and not in me 
where it belonged. 
So, the subject line may have something apropos, but any email with no text 
and a ".pif " attachment should probably be deleted.
