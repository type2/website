After exensive archive research I found that I should use GL-4 90 weight oil, but not the specifics of changing it.  I also had no luck finding this info in my Bentley.

it is on the side of the tranny, uses a really big allen wrench to remove.

oil goes in until it just reaches the fill hole

I use a enema syringe to put the oil in.  cheap at the local drug store,
and you get the enema as a bonus, of course a used one works just as well
when cleaned ;8*?
