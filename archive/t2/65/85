Subject: Found Vanagon With Porsche Engine

I found a 1980 Vanagon (in a storage yard) its been there for three
years. The owner will sell it for storage charges of $2400.00.
The Vanagon has a 1972 Porsche 911T engine in it with a 5 speed tranny
and mechanical fuel injection (needs a $1300.00 fuel pump) he says. He
claims it to have a 3.2 Liter engine vs the lesser desirable 3.4 Liter.
All of which means nothing to me.
I'm not knowledgeable on Porsche stuff and the 80 Vanagon body is trash,
the mag wheels were stolen so it comes with 4 concrete blocks and wheels
or tires. 
My inquiry into the condition of the engine netted me a buyer beware
response of *it was running before the fuel pump quit*. 
Any chance this engine and tranny might be worth the $2400.00 he's
asking?
There are many parts missing from the Vanagon, no heater system, grill,
bumpers, tail lights, cracked windshield, lots of seam rust to match the
rust below every window. At 2600 pounds the body is worth 3.3 cents per
pound less the $75.00 to get it hauled.
I'd curious to know the HP on the engine and likelihood that it might
transfer into a decent 80-83 Vanagon body.
I'd like to hear your comments since everybody knows more about Porsche
than I do.
