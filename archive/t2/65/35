Chuck,

That is very true and, alas, finding the bus with the part you need
damaged by a previous customer isn't just a CA experience.  I can't tell
you the number of times the part I ws looking for was present but damaged
on a bus in any junk yard.  Even yards where the yard does the pulling are
not innocent.... I stopped at Bry's[1] in Seattle to get some stuff and
the gentleman pulling the parts i wanted was removing and dropping the
fasteners!!!  I hadda stop him and hold out my hand each time.  I didn't
know if I was gonna need those screws, but I *knew* from past experience
that the universe is a perverse place and any screw I didn't collect was
gonna strip!

[1] speaking of which... anyone know the status of Bry's?  I will miss it
next tour if it is truly gone :-(
