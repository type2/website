Subject: sliding window update

Well, I tore into my driver's side window that wouldn't come back  up.  It appears that the part that attaches to the bottom of the  window has broken apart from the part that screws it to the  slider.  I have another door I've been saving for Billy and it has  the same problem.  (Sorry, Billy)  I've been unable to get  the part off of the bottom of the window.  I don't really want to  break the glass.   I guess once I got it off, I could have it  welded back onto the part with the screws.  I may look and see if  I can find one online.  But I doubt it.  Any ideas?   Surely somebody else has had this problem.  Too cold now to drive  without it.  Thanks...KR
