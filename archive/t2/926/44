Subject: RE: [T2] Brake squishyness

Have you checked on the condition of your rear wheel cylinders? If you old
rear brake hoses were indeed OEM then they would have shrunk considerably
restricting the amount of fluid that would reach the cylinders. Now that you
have removed this restriction the question is how well you old wheel
cylinder seals can cope with the increased volume and pressure. Chances are
that you have created an new weak link in your system. The only way to find
out is by pulling the rear drums and peaking under the wheel cylinder dust
caps. Dry? Then you lucked out. Wet? Time for new wheel cylinders. Has the
fluid leaked onto the linings so that the brake shoes are wet? Order new
shoes, too.

Does the '70 have a brake booster? If so, fluid (water or brake fluid) in
the booster can cause the pedal not to return. However, the pedal would feel
hard since you would have lost the booster's assistance.

Squishyness is a sign of either air in the system or a leak. If you can pump
up the pedal, it may be air. If not, it must be a pretty bad leak. Since the
pedal is not returning properly I am voting for a leak or a bad master
cylinder seal.
