Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 down to a 1200?

hello Guys  I have done this changeover a bunch.  As said you  will need the 
adapter plate for the crossbar and you will have to machine the 12  volt 
flywheel to fit the 6 volt crank in the 1200. You can do this on a common  brake 
lathe and it requires you to remove the outter lip of the flywheel where  it 
connects to the crankshaft. You will have to use a paper or metal gasket on  the 
end of the crankshaft as was done with the 1200 motor anyway. you can't use  
the flywheel o ring as in the 12 volt flywheel  later  Mark  Dearing
