 Karl,
With all due respect, I thought the whole point of a list like this
one was to not throw "you should take it to the shop" in each other's
face.

Working on AC systems is not something you do in your driveway if you have zero tools or knowledge.

Not sure where you live, but here in California you have be licensed to buy R-12.

In your case, you are going to spend more on tools and a vacuum pump to do something once than you would spend
to have a professional do it right.

Don't get insulted, but you don't have a clue as to what you are doing. You need to go to city college and
take a course on auto AC systems. I have been fixing cars for 40 years and even though basic AC is the same,
systems change every year.
