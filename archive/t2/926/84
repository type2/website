Hey I am working on a 69 westy and have a question about the rear apron
and what I see called a valance ( when looking for sheet metal parts  )
that looks like it is behind it.  The engine compartment of mine was
pretty much trashed thanks to the PO putting in a big engine and cutting
everything out.  I have gotten it 95% back together but am not sure if I
am missing a part behind this rear apron.

Is there a piece behind the apron or does it just use the 2 bolts on
each side to hold it to the triangular mounts?

Does anyone have a picture of what it looks like with the apron off and
this piece on if I need it?

Thanks for the help,
