Subject: lessons learned  ..  have some questions

Lesson 1:  Don't assume a part is bad and replace it.  I thought I had 
done enough to determine that the whine was from the alternator bearing, 
as it stopped when the alternator belt was removed.  It turned out 
(after replacing the alternator) that the nut that holds the larger 
alternator bracket to the fan shroud rattled off and the whine was from 
the alternator bouncing around.  Thanks to Karl for providing the specs 
on the missing 8x1.25 nut.

Lesson 2:  Don't work on the bus with it in the garage anymore.  My home 
and its contents are far too valuable.

Lesson 3:  Always remove the battery ground even if I'm not planning on 
touching the electrical stuff.

So I go to put the top nut on larger alternator bracket today.  My plan 
is to remove the alternator from the brackets, and move it out of the 
way while I secure the larger alternator bracket.  As I was doing this I 
melted the wiring harness from the alternator to the VR.  I don't 
believe I damaged the alternator, as the charing was limited to the 
plate on the back that the cooling boot connects to.  I did, however, 
fry the wiring harness.  It caught fire and I had to get the 
extinguisher out.  One quick well directed burst and everything was 
under control.

Question 1:  Should there be a lock washer where the larger alternator 
bracket attaches to the fan shroud?

Question 2:  Is it possible the alternator survived?  I suppose I could 
have it tested at the FLAPS, or test the output when I get things put 
back together.

Question 3:  Is the wiring harness from the alternator to the VR 
available new?

Question 4:  Did i fry the VR?

A bit shaken (Not stirred),
