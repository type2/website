Brian,

If the 1200cc motor is out of a beetle, it won't mount up to your engine
crossmember without an adapter plate that bolts up to the oil pump cover.
Also, your eyes are not deceiving you, as the whole motor is smaller and the
rubber air seal won't seal, as well as the doghouse etc...
There also may be some proprietary ignition, intake manifold and other
things that won't fit.

I wouldn't do it since a 30-40 hp 1200cc motor will barely move your Bus.
You would be stressing out the motor so much that it just might grenade on
you, especially if you don't know its age. 

But, it might be fun to mess around with it...

I bought a 70 Westfalia with a dead 1600 in it, my uncle found a 1200cc for
me to use until I can get the 1600 rebuilt.

I realize it's a small motor for a heavy bus, however, I was wondering if
the swap is possible?

Anyone happen to know if the rear crossmember lines up? its quite a bit
narrower to my eye.

Cheers
