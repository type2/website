Hi BaH

The supply of early bay (68-75 in this case) parts buses around here  
is EXTREMELY thin. And when you do find one, the parts you need are  
suddenly very pricey.  I did find a 72 this morning that might be a  
suitable donor, but I won't have time to get back to it for a week  
and I was told it might be gone by then.

Modifying the coupler is easier and accomplishes the same goal. Plus,  
if I ever decide to go to a 091 tranny I won't have to swap the rods  
back.


Happy Trails,
