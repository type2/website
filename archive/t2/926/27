Interesting.  I don't know anything about 'brazing.'  I know  welding is fusing metals together electolytically.  Is brazing  just fusing metals together by heating them until they melt  together?  What kind of material does one use to braze metals  together?  It must hold up pretty well if yours has withstood 10  years of cranking.  I roll mine up and down several times a  day.  What do you need to do it besides a good blowtorch?   Thanks....KR

don't remember if you have to remove the window frame

doing that, the rest is gravy. -BaH
