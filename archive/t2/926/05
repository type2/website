I dunno if I would leave the seal in there....  you can clearly see into the 
cylinder thru the spark plug hole... I would think you could bring the 
piston near TDC.. that would place the seal under the plug hole... and you 
could fab up a little fishing hook from wire ,, or maybe use one of those 
flexible expanding claw devices..

just my speculation!
