Subject: Mercedes rims, lug patterns, and offsets

Hello group... I already have some answers, but will take all info I can get 
in this.

The lug pattern is 5x112 ? Correct ?

I want to go to 16" rims, and will get info on the proper tires later.

And what offsets are good for a 1971 Type II. Is there anything I should be 
careful of when selecting a Mercedes type rim ?

Some of those Mercedes rims look damb good on a bus.
