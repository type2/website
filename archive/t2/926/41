Welcome back, Jerry.  Been worried about you and Melissa.   Hope the recovery is speedy.  Best thing to do is climb back up on  that horse.  Or in that bus!  (And maybe cut down on the  breakfast burritos.)  Hope to see you sometime when I make my  western trek.  Keep those Aridzona bus posts coming!   Cheers...KR

and leg and arm are OK. I really appreciate all your thoughts and prayers, I
still do. It will take some time to type this message to all of you, but I
must do this myself. Many of you sent cards as well. Have no idea if I can
respond to all of you, but I will do my very best.

Bless all of you so much and thanks, I will see some of you soon at the next
VW event in Phoenix, uj
