For the front ones, I put a power-washer (or just the
car wash spray wand) into them and blast downwards,
though I suppose that risks blowing some connector off
if there is a real solid blockage.  Outlet is more or
less at the front jack point, and is itself a port of
entry for rust.

For the rear ones, I reverse and blast upwards from the
end of the drains which are in the ventilation openings
at the high-side rear corners of the buss.  This cleans
nothing -- it only clears blockages.  I've no idea how
to get into the apparently closed space where those rear
drains drain from.  Feeding a vacuum cleaner hose into
that space and rummaging around didn't do all that good,
either.

Wish I didn't have a sunroof, actually.  They don't
age well...
