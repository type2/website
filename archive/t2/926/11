It appears that the part that attaches to the bottom of the  window has broken apart from the part that screws it to the  slider.  I have another door I've been saving for Billy and it has  the same problem.  (Sorry, Billy)  I've been unable to get  the part off of the bottom of the window.  I don't really want to  break the glass.   I guess once I got it off, I could have it  welded back onto the part with the screws.  I may look and see if  I can find one online.  But I doubt it.  Any ideas?   Surely somebody else has had this problem.  Too cold now to drive  without it.  Thanks...KR

when it happened to me I got one from busted bus, but I think bus depot
had em too
