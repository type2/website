I never talked about R-12

Yes, you did. Here is what you said:
"When time came to fill the system it seems to take a very small amount
of freon (1/3 lb) until the pressure gauge reads 35psi (fully
charged)."

Freon is a registered trademark of DuPont. Only DuPont can use the name Freon to describe R-12.
Any other company calling R-12 or Refrigerant 12 or Dichlorodifluoromethane by the name Freon is violating
copyright law.
