We have 4 OEM bug wheels (15x5) on our 69 Westy Hardtop, and just put  
new Kumho 215/65s on him.

Nice tires...incredible difference between the old set of wheels  
which were 15's in front and two different types of tires, and then  
OE 14's in the rear, again with different brand tires.

For the rear wheels/tires, there is less than an inch clearance  
between the tire and the inside of the wheel well. A little tight,  
but not dangerously so.

I can see where Karl's comment below would be totally on target about  
the larger Benz wheels being WAY too wide.
