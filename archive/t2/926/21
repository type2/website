Subject: Re: [T2] Refurbishing the shift linkage

Greg - why don't you just simply replace the front
section of the rod? It's a five - minute fix and they
couldn't be more than $5 from anywhere! My '74 front
rod section is an exact duplicate of the '79 except
for length. I know, cuz I had them all out trying
this, that and the other thing a few months back.
You'll likely need a new front bushing again.

I played around with moving the coupler on the shift
shaft back at the tranny. Get an extra set screw or
two and carry with you... but the "trick" is to gring
the end of the setscrew flat - or at least much
flatter than it is - and then you can adjust where you
want it. It held for me for just about a full year and
the screw fell out - probably because I didn't LocTite
it in cuz it was temporary! -BaH
