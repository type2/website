Subject: 79 square port heat exchangers for sale

 Hello all. I have a pair of heater boxes from I believe a 79 bus. I'm not real sure as I got them from a friend's barn. They are the square port style with the dual outlet. I'm offering them up to the list at a lower price because of the help that the list has given me on my previous westy which is now sadly gone. I'd like to get $75 for the pair. Pictures can be seen on TheSamba. I'm located in Lynchburg, VA. Thanks a bunch. -Evan
