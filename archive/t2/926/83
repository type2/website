Subject: RE: [T2] sunroof drainage

     Coat hangers, compressed air, pressure washers, all of the above.  
Basically, whatever works.  Mark Dearing (I think) gave me the great idea to 
use an old clutch cable with the end cut off, chucked into a hand drill.  
The end of the cable frays and really helps whisk out the crud.  I also used 
compressed air from my air compressor, a borrowed pressure washer, and some 
drano (which was probably a bad idea I've heard).  I got the drains free... 
eventually.
     Of course I ended up getting rid of that bus because, sunroof busses 
don't age well :-)

The drains are basically in front of the rear wheel and behind the front 
wheel, as I recall.
