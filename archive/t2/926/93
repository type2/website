Dave,

I did this with my DC. I replaced the center section with water heater
exhaust pipe. It is double-walled and work much better than aluminum
ducting. With some aluminum tape and some industrial zip ties, it was a
simple project. I also wrapped it in bubble wrap insulation.

I would like to improve the heat in my 78 Westy, but can not see any way to
get at the long paper tube from underneath to clean, replace or insulate it.
Can anybody tell me how?
