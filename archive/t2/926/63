 When time came to fill the system it seems to take a very small amount
of freon (1/3 lb) until the pressure gauge reads 35psi (fully
charged). AC clutch kicks in, air blower blows, cold-warm air flap
works but still no cold air in the car. I do not have a high pressure
reading gauge (yet)

Where did you read that system is fully charged at 35 psi??

You need to evacuate the system, pull a vacuum on it for about 30 minutes, add the required oil, and then fill
it to the capacity listed under the hood on a sticker.

You need to stop and take it to a A/C repair shop.
