Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal Switch 72 Bus

Unfortunately, Bus Depot is correct.  1972 ONLY.

but.......

IF you can find one, a 68-71 will work.  Just don't use the Black w/Purple
Stripe Wire that originally comes from Terminal 54f on the Late 68-71 Hazard
Switch (this controls the stoplight action on the 68-71 models).

Now the trick is finding a 68-71 switch - they've been obsolete for several
years as well.  Wolfsburg West's 66-67 switch assy is reputed to work for
the 68-71 applications if the 68-71 housing is utilized.  The 1972 housing
is the same (I've used them on 68-71's in the past when I wanna nicer
looking one).
