Ok, I'm with Dave on this one, I look under there and see some kind of 
wrapped giant pipe running down the middle of my van. I know you've 
disassembled this, so how about a howto and starting from scratch. I like 
the info you provided after the part about discarding everything, but 
perhaps you could tell me what I'm going to find when I start hacking up 
that padded pipe ??
Thanks,
Courtney (who hates unwrapping the unknown) :-)


 Can anybody tell me how?
