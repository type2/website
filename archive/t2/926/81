<<A year before I paid a garage to convert a Chevy Van from R12 to R134,
and paid $450.00 for them to do it 

<<hey jeff You should have done some shopping that is way too much
unless they had to change everything.>> 

Depends on what "Everything" is Mark. 
Dryer,& orfice tube, suck it down, & recharge. 
It's very close to being right. 


If he got a new compressor, clutch, lines & hoses, evaporator, orfice
tube, dryer and condensor , along with the freon swap in the
"everything" you mentioned --he got a BIG, LARGE, bargain. 

The shop got took on this deal with the word everything. 

Either way he did his shopping OK----
