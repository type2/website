For even more fun, stretch a plastic bag across the mouth of a small
beaker or jar to form a shallow "dish", put a few drops of water in the
"dish" and put the whole works in your Mason jar.  Pull a vacuum and the
water will first boil and then FREEZE!  Boiling and freezing at the same
time!  :)

The reason you have to suspend the water in the plastic bag is to make
sure that all the heat used to boil the water comes from the water itself.
The water will get colder and colder until enough heat is removed to
actually freeze the remaining water!  If you just put the water in a more
substantial container, the water will pick up heat from the container so
it will all boil away without freezing.
