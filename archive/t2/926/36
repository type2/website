Yeah, I'd like to take a welding course or something and learn how to  do it.  It would come in handy with the bus.  Never had much  desire before.  I've done a lot of soldering with electronics but  that's about the extent of my knowlege on these subjects.   Cheers...KR

 In welding, the work gets melted.  Some foreign material is 
usually added, to form a new alloy which is the joint, but melting 
the work is inherent in welding.
 Soldering doesn't melt the work but merely wets it with a 
molten metal of lower melting point.   If you test a soldered joint 
to destruction, the solder will bust or detach from the work before 
the work breaks (unless the work is foil-thin).
 Brazing is much more like soldering  -  the work itself is 
not melted (tho' it has to get plenty hot for the added molten 
brazing-rod to wet it).  Lumiweld is a form of brazing, for aluminum. 
Even a first go at Lumiweld will probably give you a joint that is 
stronger than, say, 1/4" Al sheet.  Brazing can be fully strong 
enough for many purposes.  You can do a good range of brazing with 
just an LPG torch; and you probably already have the LPG for a 
barbeque.

 This is the most superficial glimpse of a large realm which 
occupies some experts full-time.  Indeed it can be wiser to turn to 
such an expert rather than try to become a 'bush welder' (term coined 
on model of 'bush carpenter').  But I must say also that it is 
satisfying to learn the rudiments of brazing & welding, crudely but 
well enough to do simple joins of metal.
