Subject: Re: [T2] sliding window update

Didn't see them on the Busdepot website.  Probably have to try  busted bus.  I did get the window up to about an inch from the  top.  It seems to be holding just with the pressure from the crank  mechanism.  Can't seem to get the bottom part off of the  glass.  It's really jammed on there.  I guess I'll have to  take the window out.  Do you know busted bus' phone number?   I think they quit using the website.  Thanks...KR

It appears that the part that attaches to the bottom of the window has  broken apart from the part that screws it to the slider. I have another  door I've been saving for Billy and it has the same problem. (Sorry,  Billy) I've been unable to get the part off of the bottom of the  window. I don't really want to break the glass. I guess once I got it  off, I could have it welded back onto the part with the screws. I may  look and see if I can find one online. But I doubt it. Any ideas?  Surely somebody else has had this problem. Too cold now to drive  without it. Thanks...KR

when it happened to me I got one from busted bus, but I think bus depot
had em too
