Max vacuum reached depends on the elevation. 

It is not how much vacuum you put on the system but
how long it stays on. Should be a minimum of 30
minutes.
 
Water will boil at room temperature at 29" of mercury
at sea level.
This is the reason for evacuating the system. To
remove any water in it. Vacuum will not remove a
liquid but it will remove vapor. Liquid water turns in
water vapor when it boils [just like 'boiling away
water in a pot on top of the stove'].

Get a Mason jar, put a service fitting in the lid, put
an inch of water in the jar, connect a vacuum pump,
and watch the water boil away!

How much water removed will depend on the age of the
receiver-drier. If the dessicant is saturated, you
will not remove it all. This is why the drier must be
replaced each time the system is opened. The air
contains moisture, expressed as a humidity figure, and
the dessicant absorbs it instantly.
