Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal Switch 72 Bus

Years back, the high beam switch portion of the turn signal switchon my 72  was malfunctioning. At a junkyard i grabbed one from a later bus (I don't know what year). AIRC A couple of the wires were different colors than the wires coming out of the old switch, but i plugged it in and it worked until I parted that bus out. I think I guessed at hooking up the mismatched ones and got it right the first time.

The turn signal switch on my 72 bus has failed.  Bus Depot tells me  
that the switch is backordered and has been for a long time.  The 72  
bus has a switch that is 72 only.
