 The lug pattern is 5x112 ? Correct ?
 
 I want to go to 16" rims, and will get info on the
 proper tires later.
 
 Some of those Mercedes rims look damb good on a bus.

BUT, watch out..... Mercedes lug bolts are 12mm, the
bus is 14mm.

Some MB lug bolts are 14mm but only on the big S class
cars: the 140 body, the 215 body, the 220 body, and
the 221 body. The ML is also 14mm.
But all these rims will be way TOOOOO wide for a bus.
