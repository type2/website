Just wait until you need to fix something while it's snowing... =)

Indeed. I learned that lesson too when I fried my Pertronix by letting
a hot wire short.

Ask Troy about my welding mishap... !

I haven't seen one, but a wavy washer wouldn't be a bad idea.

Possibly. Flaps can't test these. All you can do is try. I've got a
core you can have if you need one though...

Not that I've seen, but the original ones are pretty tough. You know
who to go see...

Possibly. I have one you can swap in to test if you need it.

The reason you had a fire was the wire from the alt to the starter is
ALWAYS hot. It's directly connected to the battery +. In fact, my alt
bypasses that starter bolt and goes straight to the battery currently
(will be corrected when I pull the engine next).

Let me know if I can help. I went through some alternator gymnastics
with the GWB and still have stuff left over...
