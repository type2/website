I may be completely wrong about later Bay window  Busses but I know that 
on the earlier ones all 4 drains exit within a few inches of the inside 
of each of the respective jack points. Its really tough to get anything 
far enough in from either the top or the bottom to make a real 
difference once they get really clogged a semi-stiff wire can usually 
stir up the clog unless its past the bend. I have a hunch that the wire 
trick might work better when the clog has not been exposed to water for 
several months. I've had success in the past by sticking an air hose up 
from the bottom. But you can't use an OSHA blower for this job. You have 
to take a male and a female quick disconnect and screw them together to 
make a real blower (also makes a great roach crutch). The other thing 
that has some usefulness is to take the skinny attachment for your 
vacuum cleaner and shove 2-3 straws in it. A bit of scotch tape will 
keep them together if you need. Then shove the straws down the drains 
from the top and vacuum up any of the crud you loosened up with the wire.
