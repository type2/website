Ha!  If you ask me ,, they have an easy fight! .... now, I only play a
lawyer on email... lol

There must be a National ART Gallery in the USA........  send a Picture of
the 'work of ART' to that recognized ART gallery,, asking for permission to
put that ART on display.

I am sure they will respond with...  Thank you for submitting your work of
ART.... but we are currently full with other displays.. we will definitly
keep your contact info for your work of ART on file, and when we get an
opening.. we will contact you to go over the particulars to display your
ART!

see,,, once you have that letter in your hand....... then the 'city' really
can't argue the definition of the item on the front lawn.... do you think
they have higher authority than the NATIONAL ART GALLERY ???? You have a
letter from a recognized body saying it is ART !!  ......... it isn't an
auto,, or abandoned vehicle...  no different than placing a piccasso on your
front lawn..

Hey,,,once you explain that to the bylaw officer... then pull a little face
look at them,,,,,  sort of like Charles Manson...... and tell them how many
other "FRIENDS" with chartruse micro buses ..... that are willing to place
their ART around the town,,,,,,,,,,  every 29 DAYS !  LOL   they can go thru
all the legalities to have them removed,,, which of course may or may not
happen.. you can't tell what your 'friends of ART' might do... some are
stubborn you know.......  lol........ and this might tie up city resources
,, for YEARS! hahahha,,,  you can have internet FLASH ART gatherings !!!
hahaha,,

YAH! ... tell them the next work of art might look like the Cadillac
ranch......... or maybe oh I dunnu, use your imagination!

like maybe an image of the virgin mary on the side.. how it looks like a
piece of toast... and it 'just appeared' there over night.

make it look like an election sign ... and follow the laws of signs .... can
you start campaigning now?

QUIETLY,,,, Apply to another dept of the same city to have your ART put on
display at the local ART PARK... hahaha!!
show that to the mayor when one dept says ok.. and the other wants to
destroy culture.. hahahaha...

OMG......
