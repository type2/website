Idle timing means nothing when you have the wrong distributor.  If 
you're going to stick with the 009, make sure that it's not advancing 
any further than 32 BTDC while revving the engine to around 3500 RPM. 
Then wherever your idle timing ends up is wherever it ends up.

I'd look for the correct distributor as you will improve drivability and 
it will properly advance your timing during cruise (which goes up to 41 
BTDC).
