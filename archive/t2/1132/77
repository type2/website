Hi Mike,
Place all of the clips on the panel at your best guess location.
While inside the bus, get the top clips in.  Use a rubber mallet to
firmly tap them into place.  Then using a plastic putty knife to move
the clips, lie down on the ground under the open door and adjust as
needed, starting from the top to the bottom on each side, then finish
off with the bottom section.  Lightly tap with rubber mallet all
around at each clip location.
Rob Garretson b.
