I would think that a healthy 1776 or 2110 engine in a bus would be plenty of
type 1 power to do the trick.  Indeed, the european shroud conversion is the
clincher.

The 1600 was standard on european market busses but not here in the US... I
wanted to do this swap on my 77 but had an impossible time trying to find the
OEM sheetmetal (tho I suspect it could be found overseas if one had the
contacts and the means to get it here)... The other issue is power (or lack
thereof) - I've been told on a loaf and esp a westy the weight makes them a
very slow & gutless beast, esp on hills. Even so, I was still considering it
as it wuold be easier (and cheaper) to rebuild, repair, or replace than the
2L, and would have done away with the recurring valve seat droppage that kept
eating motors (and eventually caused me to sadly sell her).
