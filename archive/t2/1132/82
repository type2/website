Subject: Re: [T2] Source needed 71 trans mount

Hi Michael,

I believe I have what you are looking for and, as the current mount in my bus
seems fine, chances are slim I'll ever it.  The part number is 211-599-201A.
It's new but shop worn.

Does $25 plus shipping seem fair?

Let me know.

Cheers,

JohnR
