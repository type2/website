Subject: re:Bus Cover

I got one of those covers from the Bus Depot-I have only had it for a month
or two. I like the fact that I can open the sides, and get into the bus,
without having to take the whole cover off.

This is helpful, as I'm still working on the interior.

I got it to protect my bus from the trees/rain /debris in my yard. My
pearlwhite paint job was getting all sorts of stains from the crap falling
out of my trees. Now it is protected, cover working well, but like I said,
only had it for a month or two.
