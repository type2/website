Subject: Re: [T2] Bypass ignition switch

Hi Max,

Sounds like  a voltage drop at the coil when cranking that doesn't happen 
when the bus is pushed.  Try checking and cleaning all connections.

You could test the voltage at the  coil with the ignition on, and then with 
someone cranking the engine, to see if this is indeed the case.

Bypassing the ignition switch might work, as it would drain less juice from 
the ignition circuit.  All that is required a positive lead to the starter 
solenoid.  My choice would be from the battery.  Your ignition switch should 
be on.  his will supply power to the coil as when your were pushed.

Cheers,

John R
