Carmen,

I've had the Bus Depot (Just Kampers) one for 4 years - it gets near daily
use for 4 months here during the rainy season (and sporadic for the rest of
the year) as my Riviera won't fit into a standard garage openings; has
survived brutal sun and heavy rains without any real visible wear. You can
also access both front doors and the sliding door - zippers and Velcro for
those flaps are all still in great shape - there are additional straps to
keep the bottom edge snug. Well worth the $ in my opinion. Mike
