Hi Richard,

As Mike has noted, maximum CHT is the most important issue for valve
seat dropping. I also think there is an element of bad luck involved! I
read recently that inserting seats with a 0.005 to 0.006 inch
interference fit would solve the problem, though keeping the heads cool
is not a bad solution either!

I set my valve clearance to 0.006 inch and as a check try with the 0.008
inch feeler gauge. It shouldn't fit! :) Sounds dumb, but it is amazing
how often you can set it apparently to 0.006 and then slide in the 0.008
gauge!

A problem that you will have up in them there hills, which is much less
of an issue for me in Melbourne, is warming up. Do you have the flaps,
thermostat, etc operating? Also, do you have FI or carbs? If carbs,
stock or aftermarket?

Martin.
