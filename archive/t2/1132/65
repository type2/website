Probably because it's not particularly convenient.  You need two hands 
to put an airplane belt, whereas in a car you've got one hand on the 
wheel and you're using the other hand to put your belt on.

that said, it is much more comfortable to drive with the stock seat belt 
holding you in place, especially while you're driving through curves 
(kinda like a racing harness).  But for overall convenience, the 
retractable belts are the way to go.
