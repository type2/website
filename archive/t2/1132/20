Hey guys.  I just wrapped up completion of my backing plate removal and
stripping.  I painted it with VHT's black caliper paint.  Nice stuff, but the
spray-nozzle pissed paint all over me and I'll have to exchange it for another
can.  At least I got ONE good coat over the bare metal before bedtime.
Hopefully this paint lasts 10 years like its predecessor did.  On to the
bearings, brakes and drum.  This might motivate me to do the other side if all
goes well. G'night, all.

Eron
