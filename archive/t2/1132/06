I'd venture to guess that it's the ignition switch, either the mechanical or
electrical portion.  there's a little nub on the mechanical portion that, when
it wears oh so slightly, will cause the exact problems you are
having. Likewise, the electrical portion could have wear in it...hard to tell
until you get in there.  when this occurs, generally the coil is hot when the
key is in the "on" position, but then goes dead when you turn to the "crank"
position.

Hi everyone,

I left work today, got into the van, turned the key and she cranked
but did not fire.
