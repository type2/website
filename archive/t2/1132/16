According to the story the city is claiming it is an "abandoned vehicle"... 
because of its condition, and that it sat for over whatever the statutory time
limit is, etc.  Probably the lack of motor and tags have a lot to do with
that.

Wouldn't it be cool...  if a large group of bus nuts, er, hobbyists got
together 
and each donated, say $20 to put an engine in it, help the owners
get tags for 
it and get it running, and totally ruin the politico's ploy in
DC?  Not only 
would that save the bus but also slap the face of those who
wish to tell us what 
we can or cannot do on our property with regards to
either our art or our 
vehicles...

"Um, see, it's not abandoned, it's a
running vehicle with registration."  heh 
heh heh...

Plus, that group of
unknown bus fanatics, er, enthusiasts would have the 
knowledge they helped a
bus in need.
