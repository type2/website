Not so sure it would be an easy fight. Many communities prohibit inoperable
vehicles in residentially zoned neighborhoods, lest they become impromptu
junkyards owned by people who accumulate junk cars the way others accumulate
dozens of stray cats. If they allow the Bus to stay, everyone with a junk
car on their property (or 2, or 3, or 20) will decide theirs are all works
of art too. Since this one does have at least a somewhat plausible claim (it
was used in a local play), then can appeal to the zoning board, but I would
expect a lot of pushback from local residents. We may think Buses can be
art, but to the average family with 2-2/3 children and a minivan in the
driveway, a hand painted engineless hippie bus permanently positioned smack
in the middle of your next door neighbor's front lawn is an eyesore, not
art.
