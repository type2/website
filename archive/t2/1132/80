Subject: '74 Bus Purchase and Conversion to Doghouse

I used to be on the Vintagebus list years ago...sold my 66 deluxe in college
and miss it.

I now have purchased a '74 camper and I'm glad to be back in the aircooled VW
scene and on this list.

It needs tons of work, part of which will be an engine.  I got a 1600 DP with
the bus, but obviously it will not fit right in the engine bay area.  How does
I make it so that the engine fits well in this area?  Are there kits for this
situation to fill the open spaces?

Thanks,
Scott
