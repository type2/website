Subject: Cylinder head issues

Hi all,

It's Friday (at least in Australia!) so I have a bit of a combined post.
Firstly, this is my first post to this list, although I have been reading all
of the advice given over a month or so with great interest and I wanted to say
"G'day" to everyone.  I have a '72 camper, running a '77 2ltr engine and
gearbox and running (hubs. Discs, drums etc) gear underneath.  It's been
lowered 3" for reason of improving the handling (e.g. in wind) without
sacrificing ride comfort.  I live in an Alpine region in Australia, with snow
and ice in winter and temps down to -15C.

My technical question relates to the discussion on cylinder heads and
specifically valve seats dislodging.  My engine was built by a reputable VW
engine guy, all bog standard, with brand new "Spanish" heads (sorry I don't
know any part no. details).  I had a valve seat dislodge (No.3 inlet) after
35,000klm (over 2.5 years), similar to the reports I've read here.  All
servicing, including valve clearances is always done at or before 5,000klm.

I wanted to ask if the cold climate and the accompanying heating and cooling
(to very cold) of the engine could have contributed to dislodging the valve
seat?  I know No.3 is the hottest cylinder.  I was advised that valve
clearances should be a "tight 0.008" or loose 0.006"?  The engine builder said
he never has this happen...

regards, Richard
