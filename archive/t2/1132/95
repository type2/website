Subject: Re: [T2] finding the timing Mark - new question about timing

Thanks Greg,

I did setup my timing this morning with a tach meter
The spec for my engine is 5 ATDC (-at-) 850-950rpm, I bypassed the idle 
stabilizer without disconnecting the advance vacuum (according to the 
manual).
Before I tune up the engine , the advance timing was 0 and my engine was 
idling around 900 rpm.
While displacing the notch to 5 ATDC , I had to accelerate in order to 
maintain the rpm around 900. When I release the accelerator the engine 
drop his rpm to idle around 700-800.
so yes the engine has the proper timing (5 ATDC) (-at-) 900 RPM) but the idle 
is lower than 900RPM (750RPM) now

Does this means something ? should I setup the idle ?
My "new" old  rebuild engine chronically lack of power , could it be 
related ?

Thanks for any help

Chris
