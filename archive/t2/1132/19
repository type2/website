Stuff like this makes me glad I live here and not one of the other 
places I have lived in the past that had far more restrictions.

I think street parking would drive me over the edge... LOL!

On the flip side we have "country cars" that drive into town to shop 
that are missing fenders or hoods. Saw the local meter guy took the 
doors off of his Dodge Dakota pickup to make it easier to get in and get 
out.

If I lived within the city limits there are more restrictions. Luckily 
I'm 500 yards outside the city limits. They'll annex us soon enough though.
