	This is a regrettably biased view, based :-)  on

* LH-drive layout

*  Northern hemisphere location

*  neglecting the need to keep your wheels on while driving backward

	or

*  all of the above

	I'd prefer, to "driver's side", L side.


	To detect whether a given nut is on a LH or an RH thread, it 
is sometimes possible to see the outer end of the thread and then 
think about which direction of turning would be needed to screw the 
nut on, as opposed to off.
	BTW my '61 Norton 99 has, in a wobbly line of characters 
stamped manually onto the nut that holds one sprocket on its shaft, 
the quaint legend  UNSCREW (meaning LH thread).
