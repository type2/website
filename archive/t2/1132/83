The 1600 was standard on european market busses but not here in the US...  I wanted to do this swap on my 77 but had an impossible time trying to find the OEM sheetmetal (tho I suspect it could be found overseas if one had the contacts and the means to get it here)...  The other issue is power (or lack thereof) - I've been told on a loaf and esp a westy the weight makes them a very slow & gutless beast, esp on hills.  Even so, I was still considering it as it wold be easier (and cheaper) to rebuild, repair, or replace than the 2L, and would have done away with the recurring valve seat droppage that kept eating motors (and eventually caused me to sadly sell her).
