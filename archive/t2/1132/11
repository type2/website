Subject: sportsmobile camper

That other thread got me searching about sportsmobile penthouse campers...

Sportsmobile used to have a page with Vw campers on it,,, it seems they want
to focus on today now, and I can't seem to find the company history as
such... but they do have an article.

I read the article and one statement stood out a bit... something I was
unaware of.
http://www.sportsmobile.com/1_articles-fc.html

"Sportsmobile Inc. has been building camping conversion vans since 1961.
During the company's early years, Sportsmobile was building the official VW
camping vans"

interesting to me,,,,,,,,  the official VW camping vans....??   hmmm,,

anyone have some info for perspecive???
