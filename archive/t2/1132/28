David,

Thanks.

I'll check the Solex's.
The dizzy was a German 009, but I found the shaft to be worn so its now gone.
I've got a new Brazilian 009 now (with points)
Timing is 7.5 BTDC (-at-) 1000rpm
Vacuum hoses all good, all elbows etc good.
Engine compartment seal is new and well fitting
I will check out the engine tin...to be sure to be sure...

regards, Richard
