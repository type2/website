Subject: sliding door interior panel

Hi All,

Before I hurl further foul epithets at my tools and other inanimate objects
potentially alarming the nieghbors - any hints/ suggestions on getting the
interior panel onto the sliding door?  Seems no matter how I pre-arrange the
clips, I'm moving one, then another, then another is falling out of the
cardboard backing, then I need a third arm and hand to keep the panel from
shifting as I add another clip, then the muttering begins... grow louder...

Thanks, mike
