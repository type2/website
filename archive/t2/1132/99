>  Recommendations for a bus cover?


Wow, I was going to chime in and recommend our zippered cover, but it looks
like I don't have to - It's been unanimously recommended by every listmember
who replied to this thread, from Massachusetts to Minnesota!  There are
better covers for twice the price (such as our Stormproof cover).  But for
anywhere near its price range, frankly there's nothing else worth even
remotely considering. Which is why I use it myself. 

Here's the direct link to the cover:

Inside scoop ... Wait a day to order it. Tomorrow (Saturday) it goes on sale
for $169.  (Just a $10 drop, but hey, ten bucks is ten bucks!)
