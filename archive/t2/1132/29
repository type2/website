	The question arises, in which direction is it better to err.
	The premier VW workshop in Splittie
Hippie Heartland Berkeley, late 1960s, was Don &
Reinhart Inc.  I put this issue to Don, who was
working on my '57 splittie; he replied with the
fine slogan

		"better to hear 'em than smell 'em".

			Right (I responded) on,
Don.  That was intoned 'Rahd awn' :-| .



Let me try a crude  pros & cons listing {courtesy
of advanced Gates Kompughgraphics.}


			PRO			CON

EXCESS CLEARANCE		pong prevention
8-)	      slight loss of power (stable)
					      valve clatter noise
						(rather easy to identify)

TOO  LITTLE  CLEARANCE	pong pronto	     massive loss of power soon
			severe valve/seat damage
no noise  -  for a short while O:-)


Those to whom this is well known will not mind my
passing along this understanding to tyros, and
may be able to insert further entries in this
spreadsheet.  If it doesn't display as a 2 x 2
table, I blame Gates  -  and request our
ListF|hrers to widen the column.
