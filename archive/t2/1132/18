Its funny how you can get the city to respond to your demands in the Palisades
area of DC but try getting help on the East side of town.

I once had to call a dozen times over a couple of month period over an old
Chevy Chevette parked in the two hour parking zone.

It didn't have a transmission and it never moved from the two hour parking in
front of a retail store I rented out.

The city didn't even ticket it.

They just kept asking if it had wheels on it.

I told them it did because who wants an old Chevette.

Finally a group of us moved it to the opposite side of the road where no
parking was allowed at all.

It was then in the way of Buses and Ambulances so it was gone in about a
week.

You gotta love the politics of DC.
