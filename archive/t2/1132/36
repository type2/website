Thanks Martin,

I have read the same about the 009, but can't put my hands on a stock
vacuum/mechanical advance dizzy.

Yes the vacuum port to the dizzy is blocked.

Thanks for the jet sizes, and I don't know for sure, although the engine
builder only put the short block together and the reconditioned carbs and the
engine were assembled at the workshop

Here is a link to a part of the resto work on my bus in 2007, just for
fun...'cause it's Friday...

Re: Cylinder head issues


The 009 dizzy is reputed to be a poor replacement for the stock model
which has both vacuum and mechanical advance. Has the vacuum port that
would have been used by the stock dizzy been blocked?

Another possibility is that the carbs were off a smaller engine and
weren't rejetted.

Martin.
