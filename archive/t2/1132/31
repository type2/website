Eron,

I think the issue was more related to uneven braking than no braking! :)
If you intend to do the other side in the near future it shouldn't be a
problem.

Hi Martin,

I don't think there will be catastrophic failure should it have to wait
a week or a month to be made even.  I live in Chico, CA.  It only takes
5 minutes to get anywhere in this town.
