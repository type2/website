Richard,

With the way the Aussie $ is at the moment your best bet is to import
one from the US. I got mine from Aircooled.net. I also have a Pertronix
installed - nice but not essential.

I recalled that I had posted the solex carb jets a few years ago on
Type2.com. Here they are again:

The specs for the carbs on a 2 l manual* engine are as follows:

Carburettors: 34 PDSIT

Main Jet: x132.5 (Left & Right)
Air correction jet: 160  (Left & Right)
Pilot jet: 52.5 (Left & Right)
Pilot air jet: 130 (Left & Right)
Aux. fuel jet: 45 (Left)
Aux. air jet: 0.7 (Left)

The manual is "Intereurope repair manual #233 Transporter"

* It doesn't give any specs for an automatic.

Martin.

PS. Nice bus!
