Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Balancing with BB's

FWIW, I purchased a milled adapter off Samba a couple years ago, which works
great for balancing the wide 5 wheels on early bays or splits (or Beetles,
etc).
The guys who put the last set of tires on my '62 crew cab thought it was
great, and said it worked fine. I have no affiliation with this seller or
product other than as a satisfied customer. I figured as many VWs as I have,
it would be worth the investment to just have this on hand to take with me
each time I go get tires.
