Subject: Horns

When the horn on my 76 Westy stopped working years ago (for reasons of its 
own) I failed miserably at fixing it.  In desperation and to attempt to 
meet the most basic legal requirements for operating a motor vehicle on the 
public roads of Ohio, I bought a hand-held cannister type air horn at a 
marine store, and when I need a horn I hold it out the driver window , 
point it toward the clouds, and pull the trigger. Birds nearby drop from 
the sky, paralyzed with shock and fear.  These small portable air 
horns  were marketed to small boat operators, and they sound like a fog 
horn on steroids.  You probably encountered them at a football game, in the 
hands of a fan that cared nothing for the eardrums of those within 200 feet.

No police officer has ever been around when I have (on rare occasions) 
pulled the trigger. So, I never tested the legal status of my portable air 
horn. And I never pulled the trigger near any one.

I suspect that persons within 100 feet could charge me with 'assault with 
intent to injure,' which is probably a felony.

Use such a device at your own risk, seldom and with extreme caution.

Ringing a large hand-operated cow bell might be a more civilized choice.
