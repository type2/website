	You are not the only one, Daniel.  I suffered a fortnight's 
impaired sleep from a bruised breastbone (not even broken; no 
treatment available) when an 'inertia' belt locked  AFTER  my trunk 
had built up quite some momentum when my 80-y-old driver hit the car 
in front.
	I consider 'inertia' belts less comfortable & less safe, all 
for insufficient benefit.  4-point harness is safest; good locking 
lap-&-diagonal quite OK and definitely better than the decadent 
'inertia' slackness.
