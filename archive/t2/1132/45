CV's.- 12 point vs Allen


Mark, mine are actually allen bolts on my Type2 77 Westy. I know some people
have 12 point bolts and so need the 12 point socket, but mine were all Allen
 heads. I've owned 5 Westys over the last 30 years and there seems to be no
 rhyme nor reason as to what's on them? Anyone shed light on that??
