Hi David,
you reported that the seat on #3 intake is dislodging, so I guess
valve clearance is continuously tightening up. Spanish heads are the
AMC brand, but do you know what was done to the heads? Original AMCs
are reported to have sloppy valve guides made of a too soft material
and the seats aren't of good quality either. Whether or not you are
only having problems on one cylinder (the other valve clearances in
spec?), I'd still suspect that you have overheating issues. Before
getting a good CHT gauge I had #3 intake seat coming loose on two
other engines with disastrous effects... While you can get around
pulling the heads for some time by adjusting clearance over and over
again, it's not a good feeling driving around with an issue like that.
While checking the Solexes would definitely be good, replacing the 009
with the correct SVDA is a must.
I had the problem of overheating on my rebuilt engine, even new heads
and carbs checked with a wideband 02 sensor would not keep the engine
from running too hot. Finally turned out to be a worn cam. Keep in
mind that running the engine with valve clearance too tight will also
damage your cam over time!
To be sure that cam wear is not the issue, get a dial indicator the
next time you adjust your valves. Set clearance to zero, put the dial
indicator to measure pushrod movement (if you're measuring on the
valve side of the rocker, you have to compensate for the rocker ratio)
and turn the engine by hand. You should get a lift of about 7-8mm for
a carb cam, the FI lift should be a little more.
Good luck, Timo
