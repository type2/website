Subject: Tire Balancing with BB's

Well today I finally had the time to get my tires changed on my '69SC.  I went to a local garage that have a couple guys with VW's to have it done.  He took one look at the rims and said, "we won't be able to balance them with those rims", he called another garage and got the same thing.  

I thought for a moment and asked to use their web and showed him Nate's Aircooled Tech page about the BB's.  I left, got the BB's measured them out and came back to mount the tires.  

The guys gathered around for the experiment and after much pondering and a consensus that it couldn't hurt we put in the BB's, paid the man and drove off.  Gotta say at highway speeds it felt smooth and well 'normal'.  I've only gone about 10 miles, so time will tell but I guess it's better than no balancing at all.
