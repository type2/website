Subject: Re: [T2] Horns

Shameless plug, but I really like the repro low tone horn that Airhead/VWG
makes.  I have installed these on a couple of Beetles and have one on each
of my Vanagons.  Plus I like the "vintage" grill of the earlier horn. And
itsa lot louder than my "timid" horns on my Vanagons.
