I checked all my connections again, but did not find anything loose or
dirty or corroded. I pulled the connections on the coil and reseated
them as well. I will test the voltage drop idea when my fiance returns
home from work.

I replaced the main ignition wire from the front of the bus to the
coil a few years back with quality wire. I guess that is why I am
leaning towards the switch having gone kaput and not the wire. Because
it ran once push started, I feel the coil must be working properly, if
it was erratic, I think the bus would have ran terribly on the way
home.

Thanks for the hotwire tip. Jumper wire from the battery to the
starter solenoid. I'll try it if I cannot get the coil figured out.
