"The 1600 was standard on european market busses but not here in the
US... I wanted to do this swap on my 77 but had an impossible time
trying to find the OEM sheetmetal (tho I suspect it could be found
overseas if one had the contacts and the means to get it here)... The
other issue is power (or lack thereof) - I've been told on a loaf and
esp a westy the weight makes them a very slow & gutless beast, esp on
hills. Even so, I was still considering it as it wold be easier (and
cheaper) to rebuild, repair, or replace than the 2L, and would have done
away with the recurring valve seat droppage that kept eating motors (and
eventually caused me to sadly sell her)."

You see T1 engines in late bays occasionally in Australia as well. I saw
one that was going to a motor auction that would have gone cheaply,
given that there had been an engine bay fire! Tinware would still have
been ok.

As for dropping valve seats, I understand the "secret" is a greater
degree of interference fit for the valve seats than stock. If it was a
recurring problem, you would also have to question what was the
underlying cause.
