Subject: Kick Butt tool for removing stripped/ruined allen bolts from

OK, my friend Phil lent me these bolt extractors which are phenomenal for
removing the &*(&*^!!!! allen bolts that have been holding up my CV rebuild
for a month now. (Well to be honest I haven't felt like crawling under the van
either) :-) I tapped the #8 one down on the stripped out allen bolt and with
one crank on my 1/2" drive it loosened and removed that &*^&!!! bolt!! Check
the pics of these out at

They are Craftsman tools, but I couldn't find a part no. on them anywhere. The
harder you turn to loosen the bolt, the tighter this extractor bites into it.
I am SO going to Sears to get a set!
