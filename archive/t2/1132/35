The 009 dizzy is reputed to be a poor replacement for the stock model
which has both vacuum and mechanical advance. Has the vacuum port that
would have been used by the stock dizzy been blocked?

Another possibility is that the carbs were off a smaller engine and
weren't rejetted. I have the stock solex jets sizes for the 2 l at home
and will post them up when I get there!
