I just wanted to note that it won't make much of a difference whether 
you have carbs or FI.  A hot engine will run hot regardless of the 
induction system.  What will affect it is the fuel mixture to some 
degree, but even then, as Jake Raby likes to call it, "a poorly 
configured engine", will just run hot.  I have have played with every 
possible AFR configuration and the only one that has cooled it down is 
when you run lean of stoich, and that just sucks the life out of the engine.

I would recommend following this thread as it might help you out:

I haven't posted much up to it lately as I've been pretty swamped, but 
hopefully I'll get the new exhaust on there when I get my heat 
exchangers cleaned up and and we'll see how that helps.  After that it's 
probably going to be the cam and compression....
