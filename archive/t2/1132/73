Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Balancing with BB's

Hi,

My local America's Tire uses a cone shaped device that fits into the center 
of the wheel and contacts on the 5 points. Slight paint damage, but the 
wheels are balanced. However, I like the adapter shown below. Will get one 
next time I need tires.

FWIW, I purchased a milled adapter off Samba a couple years ago, which works
great for balancing the wide 5 wheels on early bays or splits (or Beetles,
etc).
The guys who put the last set of tires on my '62 crew cab thought it was
great, and said it worked fine. I have no affiliation with this seller or
product other than as a satisfied customer. I figured as many VWs as I have,
it would be worth the investment to just have this on hand to take with me
each time I go get tires.
