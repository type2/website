Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Balancing with BB's

Stan I ran them in an offroad mudder truck (that did get run onroad at speed)
and they work amazingly, after you get a little speed up.  Only real annoyance
is they eventually sort of sandblast/shot clean/peen the inside of the rim
(could be a positive who knows 8-)  And you sometimes notice the noise (mostly
when stopping.)  The concept is solid though.  Good old tire places should
have a wide 5 adapter though, or some places spin balance on the vehicle, look
around.  Or you can always bubble static balance, and get pretty fair results,
I've done that for years with a commercial FMC bubble unit I got (that tapers
big enough to do wide 5s), and even on FWD it does a fair job, used it until I
picked up an old spin balancer last year.

The guys gathered around for the experiment and after much pondering and a
consensus that it couldn't hurt we put in the BB's, paid the man and drove
off.  Gotta say at highway speeds it felt smooth and well 'normal'.  I've only
gone about 10 miles, so time will tell but I guess it's better than no
balancing at all.
