	That spark could possibly be erratic  -  working only 
sporadically.  Dud coil would be the most likely explanation of that.
	But more likely, I think, is that you have a high enough 
resistance at a key contact  e.g  'earthing' {you probably call it 
'grounding' if not 'framing'} from the battery.  The 'other end' of 
the circuit to the ignition is also a good candidate to have 
developed a resistance of, say, 100 ohm, thru corrosion.  Anyhow, I 
predict that when the starter is drawing c. 100 amp the voltage 
across the coil drops below c. 10 V and the ignition will then not 
work.  When you roll-start, the dominant drain by the starter is 
absent, and the coil may then be getting, say, 11 V which does allow 
it to work.
	So, Max:

Mechanic, schmechanic  {as some say in parts of your country <:-| } 
....  you can probably fix it yourself in a half-h.
