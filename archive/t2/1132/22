3 is not necessarily the hottest - I have 4 CHTs running and I have 
noticed 2 and 4 run the hottest.

I would first recommend getting a CHT and move it around from cylinder 
to cylinder and see what your temps are doing.  If they're hitting 400 
or higher, that's the cause of your problems.  Based on the year of your 
engine and the fact that you're driving hills, I wouldn't be surprised 
that you're overheating your engine.  I have a 78, which is essentially 
the same and I'm dealing with the same problems.
