Subject: Quatro for sale

I know it is not Friday but my brain is so porouis I doubt I will remember 
that long.   in any case I had to drive up to New Hampshire last week 
(only saw one bus on the road)  but on the way back just west of Troy NY I 
saw a white Vanagon looked like a Quatro may have even been a camper for 
sale.   I know how rare these are and some folks on this list are 
interested.

it was white parked in a parking lot on the North side of route 7 about a 
mile East of the New Brunswick Harley Davidson dealer on Hoosick road (Route 7)

if this can be forwarded to the vanagon list I would appreciate it. this 
bus looked to be in good shape, but I only saw it going by at 50mph and 
didn't have time to turn around and go back and check it out. so if anyone 
is in the area.

appologies for slightly off topic post.

Bob
