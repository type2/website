Calling the Sportsmobiles "THE official VW camping vans" is a bit of a
stetch; "ONE of the official VW camping vans" would be more accurate. During
the heyday of the Bus, Volkswagen of America officially "sanctioned" several
U.S. companies to produce campers that were sold by some Volkswagen dealers
as an alternative to the Westfalia. Sportsmobile was one of them. So was
ASI/Riviera, who also made a "penthouse" poptop camper. I don't know about
Adventurewagen (who made high tops and was the third major U.S. VW camper
producer) but I wouldn't be surprised if they were "official" too.
