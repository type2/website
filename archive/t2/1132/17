hmm,,, laws different all over the place.. but you said yours was a in-op
vehicle...  I read in the article... they have a work of ART on their front
lawn..................

see,  calling it an RV just gets you in trouble too.. .. but calling it ART
seems to have some merit... [in my mind lol]

or.........  if you are allowed to have a trailer..... put a tow bar on the
front.. and get a trailer plate.......... hahahaha.........

I think there is a way......... maybe we should all send the Councilmember
our thoughts...... sort of like that stolen vw that the insurance company
had to deal with...  this lady should know the legalities of this,, with her
credentials! http://www.marycheh.com/
