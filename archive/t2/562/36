Subject: SVDA with Stock 34PDSIT carbs

So from what I can glean the ACN SVDA should work just fine with my 73 
1700 with Dual Solex 34PDSITS. I just figured I would ask you all to 
see if I am on the money or not ! This whole gas millage discussion has 
got my interest up about the SVDA.

I know I have all the plugged vac hoses that were originally connected 
to the stock dizzy before the 009 went in but I just want to confirm 
that it will work out and how I hook them up !

So, will the SVDA work nicely with my carbs ?

Steve
