Subject: first start up of used engine and how to clean out?

I got my (new to me, but used) 2L installed a couple minutes ago.  History
of engine is unknown. The engine was still full of oil, so I drained it.
When I did, the oil strainer plate was literally coated with black crud, not
metallic but thick enough that I had to use a wire brush and carb cleaner to
get it all out.  I am sure there has to be more of this crud in the bottom
of the case of this engine.

What would be the best ting to do to try and get rid of this?  I have heard
using Marvel Mystery oil (I forgot the proportions) let it run, sit a day,
run a little more and then drain back out. Then fill back up with oil.

Will this work and if so, anyone have a good mixture ratio to try.

The engine turns by hand, so I am hoping all is still well..

Any hints or suggestions are appreciated.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
