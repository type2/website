Subject: fitting a moustache bar to a Mexican case

I have a newly built engine with almost new Mexican cases. Can someone confirm
what size bolts fit the moustache bar to the 3 holes? I believe the bottom
hole is M8. Are the two upper holes M10?

My M10-1.5 tap begins to thread in and then stops. I'm not sure if it's dirt
in the holes or the wrong thread. I don't want to get rammy with it until I
know for sure the threads per mm pitch.

Also, I have a full flow filter setup, with the fittings sticking out for the
oil hoses. The moustache bar is making fitting the fitting on the oil pump
cover interesting. How did others deal with this?
