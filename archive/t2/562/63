Subject: Hela coil bonded to spark plug

Hi Volks,

I have a hela coil (is that what it's called to
re-bore and re-thread?) problem.  The #4 spark plug
hole in my rebuilt 2 ltr fi 76 engine has been
re-threaded with a hela coil. The hela coil sleeve has
magicly decided to bond itself to the spark plug.  I
have cleaned off this spark plug and put it back. But
it's days are numbered.  The hela coil sleeve seams
almost melted on to this spark plug.  I have a 72
bus/casy which has no overhead engine hatch. Can I put
a new threaded sleeve in easy myself without removing
the engine? In other words, is this a thing someone
like me that only does tune-ups can to or is this a
big project putting a new threaded sleeve back in? 

The threading on the re-bore is still good. Just that
the current sleeve is in holy wedlock to the spark pug
instead of the engine block where it belongs! I just
need to get a new threaded sleeve installed and bonded
to the engine. Can a back-yarder like me do it?

Thanks for your help,

Rae
