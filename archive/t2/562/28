Subject: RE: Titles in Washington State. UPDATE!!

OMFG! I called up a few Auto License Sub-Agents asking if they could
give me the right spelling of his name, and verify his address. I
FINALLY got a place, and they corrected my spelling issue, and gave me
his CURRENT address (mine was outdated)!  I then looked up the name in
switchboard, and found  him listed at the right address! So tonight when
I goto my roleplaying game I'm gonna phone him up (I don't have long
distance here, long story, don't ask) and if all goes well I'll have
this done in no time, and LEGALLY! Whoots!

Thanks for ALL the advice! I really truelly appreciate it! Now I'm off
to get this big bad bertha back onto her wheels, and running smooth.
(just as soon as I finish testing the ECU harness resistances, and
voltages and whatnot). My Muirs book came yesterday, and a couple
others. Still waiting on the Bently, but Muir's seems to have LOTS to
keep me busy with. :) 

Thanks again!
Chris and the uber wonderdog Ubu!
