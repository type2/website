i lived in austin, but i have been in yards in oxnard, ca., houston, 
san antonio and  a tiny texas town that had acres of old trucks... 
all said the same thing: if you go out there, NO TOOLS. come back and 
tell us what you want, we'll get it. these were yards that either 
knew me, or knew the person i was with. others were allowed out in 
yard only with escort. the austin vw yard had some kids take a big 
screwdriver as pry bar to a  radio in  a splitty  dash to get it out. 
ruined both.

the other thing that would drive me nuts is either finding the part i 
need damaged by someone 'experimenting' with it, or they would fail 
to put all the pieces back where they belonged. i could sometimes dig 
in the weeds to find em, but it was annoying.

perhaps you are conscientious and careful, but others aren't!!
