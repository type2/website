Subject: Question about clutch throw out bearing. 

Hi list members.
Newbie question and I don't have the Benley Manual yet. ( I know, get it!).
Which side of the trow out bearing faces the engine? My thow out bearing has
one side that sipns, the other side does not. Is the spinning side the side
that faces the flywheel / clutch assembly?
