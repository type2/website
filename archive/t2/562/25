Subject: It's RUNNING!!!!!!!

After all that....

The "new" points I installed had issues. (Made in Mexico again... Grrr...) The
bit that rids on the eccentric part of the dizzy shaft was worn down already
so far that the points wouldn't open. The points themselves were green with
corrosion. I replaced with some Bosch ones, gapped (no dwell meter) and AWAY I
GO!!!

Now I have a problem. The friggin dizzy is a 009!!!

I'm not happy with a 009 on my 1700. :( Isn't stock supposed to be a 050? I
want my vacuum advance. Anybody have something better than my 009 for sale
cheap?

Everybody: Thanks for all your kind words and support. The bus is running
pretty good now, idling nicely, and just begging me to get to work on the
steering. heh

Thanks!!!
Don
