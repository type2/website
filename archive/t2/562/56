Do them one at a time and lay all the parts out in "groups" that go" 
together" and you will be fine. I put the various portions of the body 
and choke in little groups and it went together again like a breeze.
Its a pretty straight forward rebuild if you are using a kit that has 
all the gaskets and parts you need.
I did both mine in an afternoon without any trouble. I guarantee you 
will spend more time than that balancing and tuning them once they are 
back on the bus <grin>. I did ...
