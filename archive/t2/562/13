In my on-going quest to get a cooling system on my '72 ((-at-)#$% PO), I
persued a thermostat through AirCooled.net (ACN). After receiving
assurances that the Bellows-style type1 thermostat would work great,
and paying nearly 5 times more for their type4 thermostat was
unnecessary (credit deserved here), I ordered a type1 thermostat this
afternoon. I received a reply from their shipping guy stating that the
bellows style thermostat was now NLA, but they had the mexican ones. He
continued by offering to fabricate a bracket and related parts,
duplicating the setup on his '79, sacrificing his Saturday so all of it
could be shipped on Monday.
Perhaps he was going to work on Saturday anyway. Regardless, I can
count on one finger how many times someone has extended an offer as
generous as that. Props to ACN. Good reliable parts, great service and
"no, I don't work for them, but I'm now a customer for life".
