sorry, but that is quatsch - EVERY junkyard i have ever been in that 
started BANNING people from just wandering out and finding things 
says the same thing: "someone went out and 'practiced' taking things 
apart, thereby destroying that and/or other parts the we might have 
been able to sell."  please do not twiddle with things to see how 
they go together unless you plan to pay for them.
