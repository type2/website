Within reason, does it really matter what dizzy goes with what fuel delivery 
system?

Obviously some outrageous combinations may not work, but moderate 
improvements in advance curve and/or carburation shouldn't interfere with 
each other should they?

I would think the cam performance would be more affected by either...
