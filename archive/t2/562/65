Subject: Rec heater levers?

Hi,
I hope everyone is having a grate weekend.
Could it be true that the red heater levers are NLA? I see you can buy the blue fresh air vent lever. I need the red one bad because I busted the left most red heater lever off, if must have been very brittle:O 
Peace
Meg
