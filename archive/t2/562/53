Well, around here, at least, VW seems to be doing a good job of selling 
$35K+ cars... I see a lot of Passat V6 4motion wagons around town ... 
particularly popular with the Tahoe-on-the-weekend crowd.

Sure, but doesn't VW "have", to some degree, at least, Audi through 
which to sell to the higher price market?  Those two companies have 
always had a tight relationship (isn't Audi actually a subsidiary of 
VWAG?), and I don't think the platform similarities (Golf / A3, Jetta / 
A4, Passat / A6, Phaeton / A8) are purely coincidental.
