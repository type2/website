Subject: Re: [T2] Bus spotting in song(Friday topic)

unbelievable how fast a bus will go and the great fuel mileage if you get
fore and aft drafting with a big rig.

Did the same from just north of Sicily to Naples on the autostrada in a 40 HP Beetle between a Mercedes and a BMW. Left lane was closed off with big concrete barriers where they were working ont eh left lane - for miles and miles and miles. Was running 70-80 mph+ with a 40 HP 1200cc in my '72 Super Beetle. 

NO WHERE to go if one of us screwed up and touched the wall. Was fun but scary - just one of many episodes when I was a single fellow in Italy. (As if now I'm a married woman... - Not hardly! <grin>!) Pavement was choppy because the repave job was not complete. Used all the suspension several times...
