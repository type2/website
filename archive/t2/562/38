Subject: Some more pics of my 73 and Q about points grease.

While messing with the points today I took some pics of my engine with the 
aircleaner off.

Just thought I'd share. Every vacuum connection is blocked off with those 
pretty colored caps. The bright red wires are the new wiring I put in to 
replace the rotted old wiring (which was, oddly, black).

There are some pics of the bad points too... I had just used a bit of motor 
oil on the rubbing block on the last set of points. I'd forgotten about that 
until Karl reminded me. So the block failure is my fault. On the new ones I 
dabbed some plain lithium grease on the block and the shaft to keep it safe. 
Kragen auto said they don't carry "points grease" anymore, but said I could 
use the dielectric grease I use for rubber and plastic connectors and boots.

Any recommendations?

Thanks!

Don
