Subject: Re: [T2] Getting that darn fan off

Okat to much to snip and clip here but this is how it got this far off.
1. Somebody asked about getting the "HUB" off and on the rear (RIR) of the 
engine.
2. Flywheel lock was suggested to hold the flywheel to torque the hub.
3. I said I have the Flexplate can't use the fly wheel lock.
4. I then said I could, if needed to, remove the flex plate and install a 
flywheel, so I could use a flywheel lock. To lasy to do that so that is why 
I asked about how do you hold down the flex plate.
5. I never mentioned end play. I am glad you did because that would have 
been the next question.


Later I have to go camping got to get out of here.
