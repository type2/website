I wish I could. The prices are based on what the rebuilder charges me.
The core charge is pretty much a supply-and-demand sort of thing.  If a
rebuilder has a hard time finding enough cores to meet demand through
sources other than end users (i.e. junkyards and companies that sell
cores in bulk), he'll set a high core charge to help "remind" the end
customer to return his core. On the other hand if a particular core is
very plentiful, the cost/hassle of handling the core return may even
exceed the core's value to the rebuilder. He may opt to forego a core
charge in order to spur sales, or set it so low that few people will
bother to return it (so he makes a few extra bucks on each unreturned
core, rather than getting back cores he really doesn't need).

But as for why the actual unit cost of two virtually identical models
can vary by as much as $60, who knows. Maybe they were borowing a page
from Volkswagen, who's been known to take two mirror-image parts that
are otherwise identical, and charge $5 for one and $20 for the other...
