Don, I am serious. You need to get out to the junk yards. There's 
supposed to be a good one in Orange County, where you live, but there 
are four pick-your-part style yards here in San Diego county that have 
buses. Karl sort of looked his nose down at our yards here when he 
visited, but the fact is that over a one-year period I was able to find 
EVERY part I ever wanted, in almost-new condition (that includes: and 
EGR valve and an unrusted EGR filter; non-brittle coat knobs; a 
perfectly good door window scraper/seal and trim; a good dizzy for 
exactly my engine year. The list goes on and on.)

One yard is in Oceanside, and it's okay (there may be one bus at any 
given time or five). The other three are within a mile of each other in 
Chula Vista -- that's were the good stuff is.

If you haven't done a lot of picking through junk yards, here are two 
things that you may not know. First, if you find two incomplete 
dizzies, you can take the parts from one to complete the other and buy 
the one good dizzy. Second, anytime you want to try a repair to see how 
the parts go together/come apart, you can "practice" in a junkyard 
before trying the repair on your own bus. I've saved a lot of heartache 
that way.
