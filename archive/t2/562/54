New Beetle Retr -Look--- We are on our 2nd New Beetle a Turbo--At 68+ years
of age  this car gets More compliments then my 1965 and 1966 New Mustangs
that I bought--have owned perhaps WAY too many cars, and the New Beetle is
the tops in compliments -- Hopefully the New Micro-Bus by VW will be the
same.  ANYTHING is better then our past Astro Van!!
We now have a Toyota Siena and its VWonderfful
