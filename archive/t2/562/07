sounds like your flexplate is either not on straight or bent, they are
pretty stiff.

you keep it from spinning the same way by using a long bar with couple
holes in it to match the holes in the flex plate

BUT, the flexplate uses the 5 recessed bolt design and is not torqued all
that high, I have always been able to get the torque up to spec without
having to do anything special to hold it.

lot of work to swap, easier to buy a different bus

not interchangeable in the sense of putting flywheel in auto or flexplate
in manual tranny bus, but the engines are interchangeable with the
appropriate changes

nope can't do that either, the end play is specific to the particular
combination of crank/case/flexplate or flywheel.  if you set it for one
and swap they are likely not the same setting and could cause probles

as one VW mechanic said when I drove in my auto bus.

not that few but they are not exactly common
