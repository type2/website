Just how difficult would it have been to drain and inspect the oil and 
strainer PRIOR to purchase???
On it's face, the evidence you describe above tells me that at best what 
you have is a core for rebuild.

What do the valve rockers and covers look like?? Just some varnish, or a 
1/4 inch of tar???
Know that the quicky flush with solvent method you describe is not advised 
if you have a heavy buildup of tar and carbon inside. It can clog your 
filter in a few minutes running and send all the crap to the bearings. Put 
on a new filter before doing such a thing, then a new filter after, then 
run it 50 miles on straight oil and dump the oil and filter again. If it is 
still dirty this last time, don't get too far from home before rebuild.

I sure would do a compression or leak down test on that motor BEFORE going 
further. If it don't meet those specs, don't waste any more time/money 
trying to get mileage out of it.

With unknown history and filthy oil and heavy tar and varnish as the only 
evidence, I expect out of spec wear of rings, cylinders, cam lobes, valve 
guides, bearings and oil pump as a base assumption, unless and until 
further inspection proves otherwise.
