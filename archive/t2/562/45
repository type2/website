Some thoughts that jumped out to me when I looked at your pictures.

My '72 uses a dual vacuum advance distributor.  There was a manifold vacuum
connection and a venturi vacuum connection.  The venturi vacuum connection
will advance the timing and the manifold vacuum will retard the vacuum.  The
manifold vacuum is much less important than the venturi vacuum.  If you get
an single vacuum distributor, be sure to connect to the venturi vacuum port
(it is the one on the drivers side carb).

The venturi generates vacuum when the throttle is opened and the air speed
going through the carb is high.  The manifold vacuum generates most vacuum
when the throttle is completely closed.

Also, where is your engine compartment seal?  It looks like you are missing
part of it at least from what I can see in this picture:

Make sure that you have a good seal, or you risk overheating.
