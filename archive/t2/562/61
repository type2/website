Subject: Brake hardware kit doesn't contain the right parts! ?????

Hi all,
	Just got finished putting together the rear brakes on my '72 westy. I 
purchased a hardware kit from an online vendor and when putting on the 
new brake shoe retaining pins/springs, I found that none of the pins 
included in the kit were even close to long enough. Everything else in 
the kit was great....an exact match but the pins were a no-go. I re-used 
the pins that I took off :( which were a good 1/4" longer than any of 
the pins provided in the hardware kit. (The kit came with 2 different 
length brake shoe retaining pins)
	
	Anyone have any insight into this seemingly strange occurance? I really 
don't think any of the shorter pins would have worked with any amount of 
force. Any thoughts would be appreciated.
	
	The brakes are working fine and my only complaint is that I have all 
new parts less these pins. Not a big deal, just found it strange.

Take Care - Jeff
