What will the poor, dear, little, wannabees do now, that they can't buy a 
van with
"'emotional' styling," to relive the '60's (that they missed, since they 
hadn't been
born yet)?

I guess they'll just have to paint flowers and "chicken's feet" on new
Astro vans..........Hey!  With a fart-can exhaust, it could be kewl............
