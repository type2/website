Subject: carb rebuild

I'm not the greatest mechanic in the world, actually, not even a mechanic, but
I'm thinking that rebuilding my solex dual carbs doesn't look like that
difficult a job.  I've got my bentley manual and my keeping your vw alive
book.  Any suggestions before I tear into it?  Anybody not recommend
rebuilding them yourself?  I bought my '72 after rescuing it from 5 years of
neglect.  It pretty much started right up but the idle is choppy and turning
the idle screw doesn't change it one bit.  Probably 5 years of gunk built up
in there, eh?

So, let me know what you think.  If I'm an idiot for trying it, that's welcome
too.
