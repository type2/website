Subject: Body work basics??

OK so I gave up on getting a new carb set. I followed the list's advice,
and got my Kadrons tuned right, so I'll see how well they stay tuned
now.
 
I have a new question. My wife and I are closing on our first house this
Wed. My wife teases me that I'm more excited about having a 2 car garage
than a house. There may be some truth in that statement.  So I think
I'll have a real area to do some light body work that my bus needs. Can
anyone point me in a good direction to get started (books, web sites) I
mostly have surface rust that I want to nip in the butt, but I don't
want to roll around with a bunch of primer for the next 5 years :) I
know there has been some discussion as to the how to's but I'm a visual
guy and I like pictures.
Thanks 
 
Zach
