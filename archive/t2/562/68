Subject: RE: [T2] Vent Window Latch Replacement

I know this sounds like an urban legend, but...

Get a new toothbrush and a can of Coke. Really. You'll be amazed! Just make

And for the chrome frame on the vent windows (mainly the vertical piece that 
separates the vent from the main roll-down)... any favorite chrome polishes? 
  I have a bottle of Turtle Wax Chrome Polish, but have never actually used 
it.
