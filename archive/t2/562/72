Subject: Trouble with Schadek Oil pump assembly on 2.0

Hello list, I purchased a Schadek oil pump (with the 'type 4' mod) from 
AirCooled.net for my 2.0l FI air-cooled rebuild project.  I also bought 
a Webcam 107 and new lifters direct from Webcam.

Aircooled.net gives lots of instructions with the oil pump and fitting 
it to a type 4, but I wonder if others have had the same amount of 
trouble I have had.

I have counterbored the bolt holes .100" on the original cam gear and 
ground the bolt heads about another .060". If I would have just ground 
the bolt heads (as per the instructions to avoid interference with the 
pump)there would have been no bolt head left, hence the counterbore.

Now the drive tab of the pump driven gear bottoms out in the cam drive 
slot leaving the gear protruding past flush on the cover side.  The 
instructions say to press the shaft in or out of the pump drive gear in 
order to achieve the correct engagement with the cam slot.  I have 
over-pressed the shaft back further into the gear so the shaft protrudes 
out the other end of the drive gear now.  I needed to do this because 
the shaft is too long overall and will need to be ground shorter and I 
am scared of nicking the gear as I am grinding the shaft end.  Once I am 
done grinding the shaft end I will attempt to press it back into the 
drive gear and achieve the specified engagement in the cam.  I also 
worry that the drive gear boss is a little too close to the face of the 
cam but I cannot see in there to tell for sure.  It is not interfering 
now with fresh cam thrust bearing and being cold, but later... The 
original cam had a shallow depression in the center of the end face 
which would allow for more clearance to this protruding boss.

Anyone had this much trouble with this operation?  Looking for 
commiseration at least.
