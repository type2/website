Think about it! You are getting BACKPRESSURE at the carb..the pump is
working fine.... but the carb must be clogged if you are getting lots of
backpressure.... Get a can of carb cleaner and perhaps a tiny wire to clean
out the carb jets.... I bet that's why your bus is starving for fuel at high
speeds...... it needs more fuel ... but the jets can't deliver because they
are partially clogged.
