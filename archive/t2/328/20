Subject: How long is each air conditioning  hose?

Hello List,

I know where I can get my hands on an a/c settup for a
bus that is complete. This settup is still in its bus.
THe bus has been sitting for +/- 10 years. The ac belt
is still intact and tensioned. This was one of the
first things that I looked for after I confirmed that
no parts had been stolen from the system. This leads
me to believe that the York compressor was not locked
up when the bus was parked. This is the overhead kind
of settup. I believe it is in a 76-79 model bus as the
engine has fuel injection.

Question, How many hoses are their in the settup? How
long is each hose. I know that it is a good Idea to
replace them when using a settup that has been sitting
this long. I do not know if the settup is still
holding a charge.

I was looking at a few businesses that made custom
length a/c hoses to get a ball park price. I got a
general idea per foot, but I need to know how long
each hose is. Thanks and have a great day!

Regards,
David Kelly
