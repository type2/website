Subject: Re: master cylinder replacement report

Hey, Billy, I got my '72 Master Brake Cylinder last night.  It has the weep 
hole.  Looks real clean and pretty and all.  $40.19 + taxes for overnight 
delivery.  Rebuilt.

I does have new reservoir grommets, spare plugs for open orifices, and an 
'O' ring, but the 'O' ring looks a bit on the skinny side.


I called VW dealer on 'O' ring, part # 357 611 243, and they said $7.65 and 
they would have to order it.

Well, I went to the local hardware store at lunch, and they had a really 
nice fitting 'O' ring that looks like it would seal solid enough to keep the 
vacuum.  $.78

I am ready to roll . . .

Now I am off to look for the red silicon seals that replace the asbestos 
seals at both ends of both the bellows on the '72.

I do have these red silicon seals on my '78 because I was able to get in on 
the (long time over, already) unofficial VW recall of heat exchangers, 
heater control boxes, and bellows (and asbestos sealing rings around the 
bellows) <<-- Yeah, another FART..

Incidentally, the bellows themselves have what looks like asbestos filler.  
You can see by just slashing at one with a sharp knife...

     (I think this is where the saying

>>curiosity cleaned the cat's clock <<

     came from!!)

BTW, while at the FLAPS, I bought 4 NGK resistor spark plugs for $1.59 each. 
  BR5ES.  These are made in Japan, not Bosch Brazil or Bosch Italy, or Bosch 
3rd world country. (My Bosch Germany points lasted over 40K miles, the 
replacement Bosch Italy was months)

I plan to set the Bosch W8CC and WR8CP and NGK BR5ES out in the open 
bay(grounded) and turn the '78 over and see just what kind of sparks I get 
from each set of plugs.  If I'm not happy with the flames, I will lay on a 
Jacobs Bug Pack ignition system, regap the plugs to .048", and THEN see the 
sparks fly!! Need that large gap for the large flame (repeat after me: "my 
glass is half full"...)


Perhaps my '78 daily driver will become my next lawn ornament ! ! !


Barry sends.

Play hard, and make sure the other guy plays fair.
