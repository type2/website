I'd guess trash in the idle circuit (if you were going slow) or trash in 
the main jet.

Double check points, rotor and coil connections. Wire up a temp light off 
of coil power to ensure that the coil is not temp loosing power (bad 
ignition switch). You could put it inside the rear window so you could 
check it in the mirror.

Still I'd start with the carb because it is affecting all the cylinders and 
my Beetle had these very symptoms once with a dirty carb.

Second option: trash in the tank floating around and occasionally blocking 
the gas pickup. I had this happen to same Beetle too. There was a little 
wire sock that covered the end of the gas pickup in the tank. It rusted 
around the base from water remaining in gas tank and then allowed junk to 
float around and block gas pickup from time to time.
