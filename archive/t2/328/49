Dave,

Of course you're right - you should never expose an A/C system to the elements.  When Phil asked if he should "worry about hooking up his A/C" I assumed that it had already been unhooked for some time.  If that is the case, and the lines have been exposed to the atmosphere for any length of time, the damage has already been done and at that point sealing the lines would not really help much.  This has been the case with most of the dozens of disconnected bus-AC systems I have seen over the years, including my own.  In this case, I wouldn't worry about not hooking it up since the damage is already done.
