Subject: RE: [T2] Spray in p/u truck bedliner for floors

  5 years ago I helped a friend get his 21 window bus back on the road. We
replaced the rockers, outriggers and belly pans. After all was done we
undercoated the whole underside with 2 part bed liner (150.00 dollars for a
4 litre kit) He lives at the beach and surfs all the time, which puts the
bus at the beach constantley. To this day the underside of his bus is still
perfect. A very worthwhile expenditure.

Chris,

As I have explained to you in prior messages all my vehcles have
urethane balck bed liner on the bottom surfaces of them.
My 85 GL has had it on there for at least 4 years--has seen and
apprciated copious amounts of calcium chloride spray and is as good as
when I put it on ---

For some reason you seem sceptical about this undercoating
proceedure--and I'm telling you it works well--no--- its beyond my
wildest expections.

Just do it----don't concern yourself with the unknown---it works
super--and very bullet proof.

Get Busy and get it done---tapping away at the computer keys ain't
getting you no where closer to getting the bottom of you syncro done.--

Later,

TK--

Where do you and your dad live? Do they salt the roads? Do you drive in
winter? 
Thanks,
