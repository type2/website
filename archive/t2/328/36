Has alot to do with the sender location. Also has alot to do with how good 
your wiring connections and wire gauge is. How accurate is the power 
getting to your gauge? How good is the ground?

Did you calibrate it with boiling water?

Maybe you have a defective temp gauge or sender.

Mine showed temps close to what everyone else says - under 220 anyhow.
