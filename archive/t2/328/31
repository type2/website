--I did the same using 4x8' door skins, maybe a little cheaper at about 8-9 bucks a sheet than the birch. Stained with plain ol' boiled linseed oil.

--I recommend getting a trim for around the outside of the panels to hide any rough cuts/edges.

I built and stained panels for my interior using 1/8" bendable birch plywood, using the old black panels for templates.  Worked good, and looks great!
