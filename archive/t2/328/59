Subject: re: [T2] Wood interior for the Westy - long, sorry

Hey Barry, I want to seek some clarification on a couple of items:

I would describe the material covering my '78 Westy's cabinets as Formica. 
Are you saying you strip the color or pattern off of the Formica (if it is 
that) and leave the Formica in place?

I plan/want to remove the Formica in my Westy b/c if is cracked and broken 
in some places, it is lifting in other places. Also because I want a Westy 
that is a bit different, I want to use a different color Formica to replace 
it. I know one friend that simply covered the old Formica with new but I 
can see a few places where the old is beginning to lift or peel and so by 
default so is the new.

So you are saying that acetone will dissolve or release the glue of the old 
Formica?

Thanks for a great article!!!
