If you have wood then it can be lightly sanded, stained, and top coated 
with urethane sealant. If you sand too hard you ruin the thin veneer. Some 
of the later baywindows like mine had Formica all over. That is different 
and requires replacement. $53 per 4 x 8 sheet in middle TN this morning.

If you have the actual birch plywood you can order it from custom wood 
suppliers or I've got an airplane catalog at home that sells 5x5 sheets of 
birch plywood (for the headliner).
