Thanks.  I will keep an eye on it. Since the Brake Master Cylinder usually 
does not get brake fluid around the 'O' ring, I don't think it will be a 
problem in the near future.  It does have the weep hole to drain fluid that 
has gotten past some of the internals, and this is before the 'O' ring comes 
into play... <<--  No humor intended.

OK, start humor now -->>

Should be safe??  Glad you feel that way.  If you p-mail me your address in 
Brisbane, and I will be glad to mail you a sample of the white material that 
is insulating the bellows, and that is between two walls of the bellows.

I would also be please to mail samples of this material to the first 25 
people who respond with their postal address.  I guess that is about all I 
could put together from one bellows.


No need for thanks.  Glad to help the list.
