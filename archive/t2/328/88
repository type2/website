I ran a pair of 40 IDF's on a 1600 and was quite satisfied with their 
performance. They aren't as reliable or "drivable" as fuel injection but they 
were OK.

Both the Haynes and HPBooks Weber manuals list them as the appropriate 
conversion kit for the 1600, though I believe the folks at aircooled.net feel 
that the 40 IDF is a bit small for the 1600 with 28mm venturis.

These two manuals suggest starting with a 50 idle, 115 main, and 200 air 
correction jets.

Aircooled.net recommended 55 idle, 115 main and 200 air correction jets.

My notes indicate the local shop set me up with 55 idle, 115 main, and 180 
air correction jets.  I kept the 28mm venturis.

Run them with a dual advance distributor for best performance and fuel 
economy; correct float settings are_critical_to their smooth operation.  
Resist the temptation to install a whiz-bang, "performance", electric fuel 
pump.  They typically put out enough pressure to unseat the float valves 
which requires installation of a pressure regulator.  You also have to wire 
in a pump relay so that you don't become a torch if someone ever collides 
with you.  Tap one of the manifolds with a suitable diameter fitting for the 
brake booster.

They do a take a while too warm up, cold starts are rough; they are loud; the 
quality of linkages varies significantly.  My personal preference is fuel 
injection over the webers, check out:

The 40 IDF's currently on my ghia will be replaced with it when I have some 
time this summer for the conversion.
