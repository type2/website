Yep temps and pressures are metric or standard. RPM are the same either way
because not such thing (YET) as metric time...

If I had my way I'd have all metric instruments. Lots of fun to see a
passenger's eyes widen when they spot the speedo pointing at 100. When I
was living in Napoli I went to Roma to retrieve my parents who came for a
visit. My mother in the backseat of my '72 40 HP Maggiolino (Super Beetle)
spotted the speedo pointing at 110 and went nuts telling me to slow down
before I got us killed. I pointed out that the taxis were passing us and
that it was really only about 70 mph.

She got suspicious a few days later when I was running 165 kph in my
friend's turbo diesel Peugeot.
