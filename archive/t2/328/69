Subject: re: Wood interior for the Westy

Long time reader first time poster. I recently replaced the paneling in my '80
Adventurewagen with wood paneling from the Home Depot. It's the sort of thing
that you might put up to finish your basement in 80's, so naturally the look
fits the bus. The panel nearly matches the original Westphalia cabinetry. I
found this project to be quite enjoyable, easy, and budget friendly. All it
takes is about 2 sheets of paneling, a jig saw, a hole saw (Roto-zip works
best), 3/8 or 7/16 screws, a drill, and a steady hand. If your looking for a
economic fix (3 panels x $16.00=$48.00 $2.00 screws=>$50.00) that looks great
I totally recommend it.  I actually recommend that you but 3 sheets of
paneling just in case you make a mistake or need to do any fixes down the
road, at least you'll have matching back up. I do a lot of cold weather
activities so it was also the perfect opportunity to tuck in some insulation
for those frigid nights. Also, be sure to carefully remove your old panels for
they make great templates for the new.

Peace,
Puddy
