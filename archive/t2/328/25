Go to http://www.geneberg.com/
  Click on "Parts and Accessories on the left side of the page.  Then select
"Oiling System".

  Scroll down till you see part # GB 227 " temperature dipstick.  No picture
unfortunately, but there is a good description.

  I don't know how one would obtain Berg's products locally in South Africa,
but emailing them would probably yield a solution to that problem.

  Dear Friends,

  Would it be possible, if you so please, to send me an address where I
might see the device (berg) you are discussing? Or could you give me some
more info to help me trying to find such goods here, in South Africa?

  I must admit, i rather fancy the idea of crossing our Kalahari  and Karoo
deserts with precise instuments and being in control as opposed to "living
on a prayer" and, as so often happens, buggered bearings and shot rings...

  Many thanks and greetings from MikeBee, mtvideo(-at-)global.co.za, ZA
