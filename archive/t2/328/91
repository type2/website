Subject: Re: [T2] R: [T2] Temp Gauge

Following my last post, its all about adding the wires once you have the 
guage. No you dont need to pull the engine.

If the temp sender is in the relief, you just attach it under the engine. 
Run the wires along the frame.

For the dipstick, rpm and oil pressure sender, you must get wires into the 
engine compartment. The easiest way is just route the wires past the seam 
created by the seal that goes around the engine. The better way of course 
would be to make a small hole in the tin and seal it with a grommet. And use 
some sort of quick release connecter. Maybe you could push it through the 
seal the wiring harness already passes through.
In the case of the rpm sender the wire attaches to the coil. In the case of 
the oil pressure sender it attaches to the oil pressure switch which is 
replaced with a speacial sender unit.

Oh yeah up front there are a lot of holes and what not to get the wire down 
and under the bus.
