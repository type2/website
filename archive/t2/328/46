Try pulling out a spark plug (or use a spare), hook the boot to it, ground the
plug to the block and see if it will fire outside of the engine.  If not, and
you are getting spark to the distributor, it is probably either your
condenser, points or rotor.  Unlikely that all four wires, plugs, or cap
contacts went bad all at once.  Recently I did have a cap go bad though
because the contact at the center (that touches the spring on the top of the
rotor) had fallen out.  Check that too.  The distributor only goes in one way
- if it is completely seated against the block and you can't turn the rotor by
hand (not counting the play in the advance mechanism) then it is okay.  You
can verify if necessary by removing a valve cover, rotating the engine to
approximate TDC for a cylinder (about a half-crank-turn past where the intake
valve closes fully) and verify that the rotor is pointing at that plug wire.
Pull the cap and crank the motor to make sure the rotor is turning with the
engine!  If none of that helps, write again and let us know where you stand.
