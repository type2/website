Subject: Oil Temps/Humidity and the Mid-Eastern SeaBoard

Jason, you didn't take into account that your gonna be dealing with 
positively hellish humidity here in sunny NC. Trust me, I'm from here. 
Raleigh, to be exact. Humid air sucks at transferring heat. Add to that the 
fact that NC gets 90deg.+ to 100deg.+ days ALL summer long. And summer in 
these parts lasts from early June to late Sept. They routinely issue heat 
advisories, and will even shut down training at Fort Brag in FayetNam and 
Camp Lejune. If the heat is too much for the SF and Force Recon guys, just 
think how your engine is gonna feel about it! I can assure you that you WILL 
see eng temps in excess of 250-260deg. on these days even on short trips (-at-) 
speeds of 60-70mph,on I-40 or the Beltline, say, from the Peoples Republic of 
Chapel Hill to Raleigh. An aux. cooler will help a bit, but air-cooled 
engines, like small outboard motors, are very barometrically sensitive. Just 
ask any of the other mid-eastern seaboard folks on the list. They'll in all 
likelihood confirm this.
