Subject: Re: [T2] Temp Gauge

I liked my dispstick temp sender. At least I did until a fan belt broke and 
ate it for lunch. Its the easiest of all temp guages although I have heard 
they are not the most accurate. Also it will be you responsibility to notch 
it for oil depth and adjust it for how deep it goes in. Not hard really.
The other options are  they oil plug sender and the oil relief sender, at 
least for ease of installation. Either way you must route a wire back to it 
and in the case of the dipstick, ground it.
