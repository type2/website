Subject: Sharing a voltmeter between two batteries

--Andy,

his interest was to keep them electrically isolated, so by running a ground directly to the battery, they would be totally, completely seperate, no matter what the double battery relay was doing, or if for some reason failed, shorted, whatever, as you mentioned at the end of your post.

and if you're already, running wires from both batteries to the front and installing a new switch anyway, no, it isn't that much more work/cost, and it gives a truer reading of the batteries, not derated in any way by excessive resistance/poor connections thru the bus ground, as a good gauge should.

I work for an electrical engineer, and we overengineer for safety/accuracy. That's where I'm coming from.

but...

you're right, you could do it.

Good point about the fuse as well. Put it somewhere easily accessible.
