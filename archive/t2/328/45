Good idea to replace the hoses I think.  That's what I did in a similar situation (system open for ~10 years).  I don't remember the exact lengths, but I can give you a ballpark figure.  The longest hose is the low-pressure (larger diameter) hose that goes from the evaporator to the compressor.  It was about 20ft long.  There were two shorter lines (compressor-to-condenser and condenser-to-expansion-valve I think).  One of these was about 12 feet and the other was maybe 7 feet.  Figure around 40 feet total.  I did make the new hoses a couple of feet longer than necessary so that I could move the compressor away from the engine while working on the engine.  I paid about $250 for the three hoses.
