Wow isnt that a bit overly complex.
they will have a common ground, the chassis.
Just run a wire from each voltage source, or 2 individual wires right
back to the batteries if you like and hook up to a spdt switch.
you should probably make sure that the switch is "break before make"
this means it will disconnect the first source before connectiong the
second. this will prevent the batteries from trying to charge one another
through your gauge wiring,  possibly with some unwelcomed fireworks.
if you run individual wires back to the batteries you probably would be
safer to fuse them at the battery end just in case of a short.
any sort of fuse would probably be fine anywhere from maybe 1a to 10a.
just so it sould blow rather than frying the wire.
