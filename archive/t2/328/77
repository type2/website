Subject: Re: [T2] undercoat-Cosmoline?

Checked a search; Cosoline is: "A combination of grease, shellac and
beeswax with copper sulfate added as a corrosion inhibitor. It is
initially heated and thinned with alcohol during the mixing state, then
is allowed to cool and set up."  Most links deal with removing this
tough coating after it has dried; many use paint thinner like solvents
or just paint over it!  Apparently it does not form a peeling layer like
dried undercoating. The mechanic I mentioned fills the body cavities of
the busses he restores with Cosmoline.  Rick Taylor wrote:
