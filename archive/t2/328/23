This would be the receiver-dryer. This is part of an
a/c system. If the hoses have been cut then this is no
longer any good. This is a part that is often replaced
when refurbishing an a/c systen that has been
disassembled for any length of time. the descant
inside becomes ruined by prolonged exposure to outside
air. If the rest of your a/c is gone and you don't
plan on reinstalling it, toss it. If you want to
reinstall the a/c, keep if for reference when you go
to buy a new one.

Have a great day!
