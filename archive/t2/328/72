Some things I have learned:  (If you know your carbs inside and out then press 'delete' now)Even if your carbs are new, remove all the jets, write down what sizes you have and get to know your carbs inside and out before attempting to install them.  If you are not familar with them,. invest in Bob Tomlinson's book on Webers.  It is invaluable!Research base line jetting for your engine.  Make sure carbs are clean and float levels are properly set.close down your air bypass screws.  turn out the mixture screws to three turns each.set butterflys -  1 1/2 turns in after contactcarbs should be mounted to manifolds first then to the engineInstall linkage, but leave arms disconnected.Provided your engine is in top running shape- start your car and check syncronization with a suitable uni-sync.if carbs are popping then it is too lean and you need to go up on your idle jets.  Idle jets operate up to 3000 rpm's. therefore the most important part of your performance.main jets operate from about 2900-3800 rpm's.  Air correctors effect the top end from about 3600 and up.Adjust the idle speed screws if necessary to sync the carbs.Install linkage arms and recheck that you did not throw the carbs out of sync, adjust arms as necessary.Check carbs for being in sync at about 2500 rpms also.You can use your air bypass screws to synch both barrels on the same carb if one is pulling more than the other.I am running 36 dellorto's on my 2.0  jets are as follows:  60 Idle, 135 Mains, 190 Air Corrector, 50 pump.I know the base line jetting for a 1600 dp and 36 dells is very close to perfect: 122 mains, 60 idles, 180 airs, 50pump.  The Webers should be close to that but all carbs and engines need to be jetted diffrently for max perforamance.Paul
