Subject: R: [T2] R: [T2] Temp Gauge

Oh, so I have to replace the oil pressure switch with something else!
Can you tell me where is it located on a 1600 '76 bus?

The oil temp sender will fit into the sump underneath, I heard I have to
drill a hole... hope will not do any damage (but I trust myself...kind of) !

Also... after one year disabled it, I have changed my exhaust system and
heat exchangers to get the heating working...
after a couple of months I still smell exhaust inside... can new H.E.
deteriorate so quickly?!?! I checked the engine seam and I can see it's not
perfecly fit in the front of the engine (Front Is Front), could it be the
cause of such? the old engine (two years ago, old and battered H.E.) worked
perfectly without the seam at all... it just doesn't make sense no? where
else could I draw up exhaust ?

Thanks and sorry for the long letter,

Andy
