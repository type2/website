David,

I have a friend that has been in the auto A/C business since we were
buddies in college.  Worked with him at VPC(Volkswagen Products Corp) in
Ft. Worth.  

Seems like the last timethe question of which refrigeraant to use came up, 
I called and talked to him about it.  I believe he said the same about 
Freeze 12.

When it gets to be time to actually fill the system, I will ask him again.

Cheers, dave

It is very expensive - about $40/gallon last time I checked.  
I simply blew this through my condenser and evaporator 
with compressed air, but I think A/C shops have a 
machine that circulates this stuff through instead (a much better way to do it, I'm sure).

After doing a bit of research, I am betting (my compressor) that it will work fine provided that Ester is used as the lubricant.  With mineral oil, I would not use anything other than R-12.
