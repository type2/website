Paul !

Thanks for help put..
How did you got the dammed thing out of the door ??
It is stuck behind the window guide channel which I can't remove
(I have taken out the screw holding the channel)
Btw, I cut a hole in the panel to get access to the screws
holding the window.

Joe !

Had a look at your site, got java error when using NetScape 4.77
And I was unable to specify lifter for left door, only for
right door.
