Subject: RMMW Show This Weekend

Just a reminder:  The Rocky Mountain Motorworks show is this weekend, August 11 
in Woodland Park, Colorado (near Colorado Springs).  The Colorado Bus Club is 
sponsering a campout on Friday and Saturday night at RMMW's headquarters.  For 
more info, go to http://www.motorworks.com/aircooled - just click on the "clubs 
& events" tab.

I know of 4 other listees who are planning on being here.  Are there more?  If 
you want, send me your name and bus description and I'll share the info with 
the other listees who are planning on attending.
