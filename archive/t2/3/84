Subject: #3 cyl not pulling its weight

I discovered a disturbing fact the other day.  My #3 cyllinder is not
contributing to the engine's power.  When I pulled the spark plug wire off,
the rpms did not change, whereas doing this for the other cyllinders slows
it down and makes it rough.  Engine does not run rough when the other three
are firing, although there is a little backfiring on decel.

I ran the engine with the #3 plug out, and it appeared to be sparking ok.
plug was not fouled.  I smelled gas in the air coming out the spark plug
hole.  Any guesses as to what the matter is?

Thanks,

Grant
