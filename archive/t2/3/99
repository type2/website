You can check it with your 'click' wrench. Just set it to 1ft/lb (I'm
assuming it goes that low) and start to turn it. If it clicks, then turn it
to 2, if it clicks go to 3 etc etc. once you find the number where you can
spin it in without the torque wrench clicking, you've found your run-in
torqure, then just add the number it to the required torque spec.
 As jay raby wrote - 18ft/lb spec plus 4ft/lb run in = 22ft/lb

Yes.
