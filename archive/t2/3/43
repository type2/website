That was me.  The compressor is hanging in there after two years.  I looked 
at the crack the other day and now I'm not so sure it's a crack anymore - 
it may just be a flaw in the surface of the fan housing.  In any case, I 
did not mount the compressor very well, and someone who is better at 
fabricating brackets could make a brace for it that I'm sure would prevent 
cracks from developing.

In particular you might check out the electric power steering pump from the 
MR-2.  Only problem is that it draws a substantial amount of current - 
something like 15 amps, constantly.  That may or may not be a problem 
depending on the alternator in the bus and the other electrical 
loads.  Personally I haven't had problems with my rebuilt Bosch 55 amp 
alternator and an additional 15 amp load from the A/C although it does 
worry me somewhat and I try to lessen other electrical loads when the A/C 
is on.

Great ideas Chris!  Where there's a will, there's a way right?  One way 
might also be to consider a Vanagon.  Don't some of them have power steering?
