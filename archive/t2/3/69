Heidi,

The suggestion above may help but if not,you may need to remove
the accelerator cable from it's tube under the van,clean the crud
off it and clean out the tube.
Folks often over-grease the cable and whilst that's OK,at least at
first,eventually the grease gets all thick and sticky and can give
problems as you have described.
Best way to clean the tube if you can is squirt in a good degreaser
or brake-clean (as long as you are careful) and then blow out the
tube with compressed air.Replace cleaned cable with lubricant
sparingly applied and you accelerator will feel like new...
in most cases anyway.
Another problem area can be where the cable enters the engine
compartment thru the fire wall.The cable can wear away at the
egress hole untill after years of driving,it cuts a groove or
keyway up thru the top of the original hole.Then your cable can
stick in this area,eventually fraying and making the problem
even worse.
I solved that problem on my '76 D/C but fabricating a small
pulley wheel to guide the cable out thru the worn hole in the
firewall without contacting it and never had a sticking cable
problem since.My D/C runs solexes but the accelerator pedal
& cable are as smooth to operate and acceleration off the mark
is as easy as a FI equipped van.
