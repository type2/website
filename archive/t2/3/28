Having pulled the distributor to check p/n I have discovered a modified 009 in
my 79 california bus engine. It has the air biscuit (two tubes) attached to the
side and it has electronic ignition.

Wanting to make sure I have the correct setup for my bus, what should be
checked/verified/changed.

Can this modified 009 be okay? I know it has been in the bus for 10 years cross
country and back. PO was best friend. Is the correct 093 very different and is
it expensive/hard to come by?

************************************************************

093??   What is that?
What is the complete number on yours?
A word of advice: If what you have is a 'manny moe and jack' ''Rebuilt''
distributor, you CANNOT go by the number on it. It all depends what is IN it.
The housing does not mean diddly-squat. The problem with 'Joe Blows' rebuilt
part # is that it is only on the box you bought it in.....then you put the old
one in the box as a core and their number went bye-bye. As an example, I found a
beetle at the wrecking yard that had a 'brand new' rebuilt dizzy in it. It was a
71 so it should have had a dual vacuum unit dizzy.....no, this thing was a
single vacuum unit and the number on it was for a 73 1700 that should have had a
dual unit on it and it would have too much curve for a type1 engine. Needless to
say, without a distributor tester, I have no idea what is inside this thing.....
Same as yours.....you should have a 039 904 205C with 21-25 degrees centrifugal
(-at-) 3600 and 11-13 advance and 11-13 retard on the vacuum unit. You may have that
with what you have since it has a dual unit and electronic ignition.....then
again, maybe not.
A distributor tester would tell you that. It can be done with a timing light,
vacuum gauge, and tach on your engine.
