Wull, dang! I wish I'd known that a year ago! :-)

Nah, we tried three sets of manifolds because AVP insisted it wasn't the
ports. I just happened to have the manifolds (my stock) so we tried 'em
all. Even had a set ground down. No go because the metal's compromised too
far down by the previous exhaust leak. The ports were resurfaced but they
were beyond help, according to my mechanic (who I have a lot of faith in).

So we'll just have to see how it goes.
