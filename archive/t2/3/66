Subject: bad gauge

Elec. oil pressure gauge came in bus -- replacing
idiot light. No installation instruction are in the
dash. whoever did the wiring would have been shot in
Wolfsburg.

At idle, it reads apparently accurately, except that
it bounces when I turn on the turn signal.But at high
rpms, it reads zero! Just dead.

Does that ring a bell with anyone. and what kind of
pressure should it register?

I Like gauges, but am considering just chucking it and
putting the idiot light and sender back in.

Also, VDO dip stick temp gauge. Works, I guess. What
should that read, or is it just relative to the
vehicle and where the probe is stuck?

Trying not to blow engine in first week...
