This has been discussed many times and the answer can be found in the
archives or in Bentley, which you should have a copy of if you own a bus.

The port on the outside of the vacuum canister (vacuum advance) goes to the
port on the left or right carb that is near the center (vertically) of the
carb, facing the outside.  The port on the inside of the vacuum canister
(vacuum retard) goes to the slightly larger port near the base of the left
carb.  Set your timing to 7.5 ATDC with both lines connected at 900rpm and
adjust from there to suit your tastes.
