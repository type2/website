Does this mean that the resistance of untorqued fasteners adds to the spec
and requires a higher value to make the spec EXACTLY ? I was confused
before, but now i'm lost. My question was, " Does a slippery lubricant "
cause the torque spec to be incorrect, and is it on the high or low side?
This has been a concern for connecting rods and cylinder heads when
locktite is applied, insofar as it works as a lubricant before it sets up.
