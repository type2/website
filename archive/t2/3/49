Subject: Hey Kids -- It's Rebuild Time!

Hi Folks,

Last week my engine (1979 2.0L FI) began making expensive noises, and I'm 
expecting that it's time to rebuild it.  It started as a high-pitched 
ticking which has evolved into a medium-pitch clunking -- I'm suspecting a 
rod.  Power is down, the engine is leaking more oil than usual, and oil 
pressure is at least 10psi lower than its usual low.

So, does anybody have any suggestions or recommendations on machinists, 
rebuilders, long-block builders, or new engines?  I like the price of AVP's 
long blocks, but seem to remember something questionable about them.  I have 
no idea what my existing components are like, but having never rebuilt a VW 
long-block before, I'm inclined to leave it to the pros.

It's a shame that this had to happen now, but I guess it was bound to happen 
sometime.  Thanks for any help...
