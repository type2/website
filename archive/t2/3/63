Sounds like the nylon "keeper" is gone.
Have the same problem with my 76 Bus. I am 
buying a new hinge ass'y from one of the
Bus saviors for around $75 bucks...

Anyone else...I mean I am a Bus novice...

Got a 68 bus with a laundry list of little probs. I'm
tackling 'em one by one. most are just a matter of
patience and hanging upside down under the dash.

Prob. 1: the sliding door works, EXCEPT, after you
"pop" the latch, the big hanger (thick curved steel
rod) in the groove on the top fails to pivot far enuf
to the rear to allow the door to slide back. You can
help it the rest of the way by pushing with your
fingers, then it slides to rear and locks correctly,
and it returns and latches fine. (I hope the
description is adequate.) 

No dents or rust in the door that I can see. Lube
doesn seem to help. Cud a spring or bushing be
missing?
