Subject: Side window stuck

Left side window lifting mechanism is stuck.
Nothing happens when I turn the handle.
According to Bentley I must lower the window to remove
the lifter. But I can't move the window down,
it is stuck in the mechanism.
So, what to do, use(more) violence to push the
window down or what ??
