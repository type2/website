Dang it list, what's the deal with the oil screen plate nut? Does it =
damage the camshaft after a meager 9ft/lbs as Muir states? Or is this a =
bunch of hooey?

What I'm sayin' is I'm leakin' oil. Can I get out tonight and crank this =
thing even more than I have or what?=20

Also, when you get the gasket kit, is it:

Crush washer on drain plug or screen nut?

With the two paper washers, I'm assuming you put one between top of oil =
screen flange and the place it hits the sump and one on top of the =
bottom plate that holds it all in.

Yea/Nea?

Thanks, Billy.
