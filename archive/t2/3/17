Don,

I did that very thing, using
   1. the stand, remove the atriculated arms
   2. a plate of 1/4" steel  (maybe even 3/8")
   3. an old bellhousing

- I cut the plate large enough to cover the bell housing mounting holes.
- Drilled the plate to match the holes
- Welded the plate to the flange that the articulated arms bolted to
- Bolted the bell housing up to the plate
- Installed back into engine stand
- Bolted engine & starter up to bellhousing.

Worked like a champ for me.  I can take some pics if needed.
Hardest part was getting the metal cut, which ended up being quite easy as I had
the metal house cut it out of their scrap with their umpteen ton sheer.

Hope this helps
