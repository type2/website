John,
This was the hardest part for me as well.  Again, let me say that the
Bentley manual was right on for how to do this.
I was getting pissed for about an hour.  Just had to use a bit more
muscle.  A little grease wouldn't hurt.  I think I used a screwdriver to
push the window guide back (be sure not to push on the flimsy retaining
clip) with one hand, and worked the regulator cable piece down with the
other.  Once I got it started, I used both hand to yank it out.
Not much in that area to damage.
Good luck.

>How did you got the dammed thing out of the door ??
It is stuck behind the window guide channel which I can't remove
(I have taken out the screw holding the channel)
