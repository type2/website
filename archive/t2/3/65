Subject: Gas tank replacement?


Folks,

So, my 411 is in the shop for the next week (don't ask, a very very long
tale of $1400 dollars worth of woe) so that means I need to get the '77
FI Westy on the road this week.

Does anyone know of a place where I can pick up a new tank and have it
overnight delivered? I realllllllly need to get her back on the road this
week while the 411 is in the shop (besides, this is just the incentive I
need to finally finish up the engine work).

-beth
