Subject: 2L Fuel injected mileage

What sort of mileage should I get? I seem to get between 17 and 20 mpg. does
this seem low?
I haven't given a good mileage test since I changed out the original air
filter, spark plugs, wires, cap and rotor from my bus. Hopefully that will
help a bit. Is there anything that I am missing on a fuel injected vehicle
that would be affecting the MPG. What about running injector cleaner through
the gas? No one seems to know if it will affect the older injection system
or not so I have a bottle of STP fuel injector cleaner that I am scared to
put in.

thanks,
Glenn
