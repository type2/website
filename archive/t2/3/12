Thanks, I just wanted to know that there wasn't something wrong . The owner
I bought it from told me around 30 and I just could not get this so I was
concerned.
thanks again

Hey there Glen,

Nope. This seems about right. I get about 18 in the city and 20
somthing (maybe 21-22) on the highway w/ my 79 westy w/ 99,000 miles
on the original engine.

Hope this helps,
