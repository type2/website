Subject: ignition coils

does any one know what the stock specs are for a 1977 2L fuel injected
transporter? I have an Accel universal performance 12v ignition coil that I
had in a 5L mustang. can I use this? my bus was hardly used so all the
ignition parts were the originals and getting quite old.
thanks,

Glenn
