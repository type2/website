Todd:

Here's what I did.

 Swapping the entire swivelplate/seat assembly from the 79 allowed me to
bolt the complete 79 seat to my bus, as the holes for the swivel plate to
the bus didn't change.

The driver seat was more challenging. I took the connecting assembly off the
bottom of the 76 seat and laid it over the 79. There were holes that lined
up, but not to the threaded holes on the bottom of the 79 seat, so I simply
bolted through the holes with cut and lock washers on both sides.

Major problem: the 79 seat have their handle for adjustment in the middle,
the 76 is on the side and needs room to swivel up into the seat area. The 76
seats had an indentation to allow for this. I just grinded out a hole in the
79 seats  until it had room. They went in great.

No welding required.
