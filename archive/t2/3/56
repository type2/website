Hi Volks,

Have a look at my left hand Solex Pict-34 Carb:

And compare to the right side at:

I've highlighted the arm from the choke (?) to the main linkage, it seems to
have broken off right where the retainer clip goes to keep it attached. What
is the function of this linkage??? The carbs seem to work OK without it, but
more accurately stated I'd simply have to say they don't appear to work all
that much worse. But that's not saying much. Lately I only get about 16 MPG.

Both of these carbs already need major work on the throttle bodies, plus the
accelerator pump is out of action on the left side.

If someone has a working linkage arm they want to sell from a parts carb,
please let me know ASAP.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
