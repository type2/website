Subject: Re: [T2] Side window stuck

Piece of cake.
Unbolt window and let glass sit on bottom of door.
Pull down the U channel weather strip from up top at the vent window.
Remove the phillips head screw in the U holding the top of the vent window in.
Remove the bolt at the bottom of the channel.
Pull vent window assembly out of door, pivoting out from top.
Raise assembly up about 6''.
Remove 2 bolts holding gear drive to door.
Window regulator falls out.
Takes about 8 minutes to R + R the regulator, including R + R the door panel.
