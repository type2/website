I'm sure you have some good reason for this modification, and having
made the opposite one ( type 4 cooler on a type 1 engine ) i will say
Yes, it has the same dimensions, except it is 3/4" thinner , having two
less rows of fins, and requires only the two corresponding thru bolts to mount.
The third bottom bolt is the same for both coolers.
