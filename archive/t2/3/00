A minor nit-pick:

No pressure amplification occurs here.  Pascal's law and all that...

Not much pressure is required, since the flow rate is low and all the 
oil has to do is lube the rockers.  No high speed bearings here.

The passages in the rockers can get clogged, so disassembly and 
cleaning of the rocker assemblies should be part of any rebuild.  I 
experienced a _very_ clogged set of rockers on a rebuilt I bought from 
Mark Stephens two business names ago.  Seems as if they just grabbed 
them off of the pile and slapped them on the engine.
