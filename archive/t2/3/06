Subject: Charging Probs. & Attempted Fix



Oh-Tay Volks,

This was the situation,  Alternater was frying my bat. w/ 18volts to
batt and fuse panel.  So me and Dave Martin says, Voltage reg!  Dave M.
says "use mine, I'm not needing it right now".  So I unplug his and hook it 
up to Janis....No juce except what the batt. supplies.   So....
I try retrofitting a Gen. from a '71 bug, (which dosen't fit right,
but darn it I wanted to go to High Country bus fest)  but still no 
chargeing, never did polorize but I'm frustrated and depressed about not 
making it to high Country and give up!

Any sudgestions and/or words of encouragement.  I'm in Landrum SC,
first exit inside SC from NC on I26.  Desperatly need to get Janis running 
seeing how she's the only legal ride I have

I'm begging here VOLKS!
