Subject: Running Rough

So, my turn to ask for help.

Daisy just isn't running well these days.  I've done the tune up,
re-checked the specs and she is timed and dwelled
alright.  The problem is a longer crank for startup and a poor idle
after.  I sometimes have to start her a few times
before she stays running and that's with me feathering the
accellerator.  When the engine is warm, all's good, although it doesn't
seem to have the power it had.  I'm going to do a comp. check this
coming week to see if things may have changed in the few years we've had
her.
I'm also going to adjust the valves as they're a little noisy.  Would
high valve lash cause startup problems?

Where would I find the hot start relay I hear so much about and would
that be something I could check?

My thoughts are that the FI needs some work.  I feel confident in my
abilities to tackle this but I need guidance.
What would be the first few things to check and where could I find some
literature online to begin the diagnostics?
This is a 2l engine from California.  The exhaust has just been sealed
up and is nice and quiet.

There's a pic of the engine (-at-) http://www.drumsetc.org/vws.html  Daisy's
the Westy.

Any help on getting me started on the fix would be appreciated.

Thanks
