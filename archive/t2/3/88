Subject: Alternator light on

Volks,
	I checked the archives and the library, but no luck so far.
A few weeks ago, my alternator light began to stay on for the first few 
seconds before I tapped the gas pedal, after I started. It used to go out 
as soon as the engine started. Then last week I stopped for gas and when I 
started back up again, the light never went out. I have a T4 engine, so I 
wasn't worried about the fan like I would with the T1 or T2 engines. I 
drove home and the next morning put in a new voltage regulator. Now the 
light stays on, but it dims at high RPMs, almost as if I could get it to go 
out if I revved it high enough. I had my old Voltage Regulator checked and, 
sure enough, the Field was bad. But why would this new voltage regulator 
sorta fix the problem? (please don't tell me I need a new alternator...)
I seem to remember reading somewhere on this list about the dimming light 
at high RPMs and what that was a symptom of, but I can't seem to find it. 
Here are the specs: '74 1800 T4 with the late bay alternator (70 amp I 
think). Dual battery system with an isolator thingy (yeah, yeah, I know, 
shoulda read the archives). That's it.
Let me know what to start looking for. Thanks
Joel
