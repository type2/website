I was trying to answer his question by what he said HE had in his bus:

''Having pulled the distributor to check p/n I have discovered a modified 009 in
my 79 california bus engine. It has the air biscuit (two tubes) attached to the
side and it has electronic ignition.''

The 205S [093] does not have a dual vacuum unit or electronic ignition......
