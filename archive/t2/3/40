Subject: Re: [T2] Power steering on an early bus

I'd like to hear of the details when you succeed.

You need to examine how the smog pump was attached on the 70s buses and 
modify these mounts to fit your power steering. One fellow I spoke with one 
time had mounted an a/c compressor on top of the Type IV shroud and 
suffered stress cracks fairly quickly. You may have to get creative. Also 
checkout how the OEM style VW bus a/c systems mounted their compressors - 
lower driver's side of the fan shroud.

You should also take a good look at the Ford system and power steering 
systems found on other VW products --- Rabbits, Vanagons, other model cars. 
See if the steering box is a bolt on replacement -- many other parts are.

The Ford push-ram style is probably the best solution.

Another direction is checking around with the hot rodders in your area. 
Many of those folks are retro fitting power steering to these cars. Model 
'A' Fords are notorious for lacking space for a large domestic style power 
steering box. I have seen the ram style power steering systems on these 
cars. (We've built several but stayed with manual steering).

Also - take a look at the electric assist systems used on some of the 
hybrid cars now.

Lastly - be sure to take a good look at the Asian imports. They have very 
compact and durable systems and may be able to be converted for use on the VW.

Hope I sparked some ideas. I don't have a perfect solution but these are 
the areas I would investigate.
