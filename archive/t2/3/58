Subject: accelerator sticking

I'm having trouble with my accelerator pedal.
Everytime I go to press on it it sticks , so it makes
my bus jump. When I start off in 1st I have to rev my
engine a little before I let off the clutch so it wont
jerk my bus. Does anyone know whats goin on here and
how I can fix this. Any responses would be
appreciated. Thanx
