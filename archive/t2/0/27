Subject: 2.5 weeks 'till I get my bus!!

Well, I made the flight reservation and I'm gonna be heading up to WA
state to pick up my new bus... shoot, I still need to request time off
from work!!  whooops!  But which is more important: a job, or a bus.. 
now come on, we all know the answer to that one!

I'll be cruisin on up to Seattle on the 16th of august and then we might
visit Canada just for the heck of it.  I'm then thinking of heading down
the WA/OR coast, stopping by Astoria and Cannon Beach (visit the goonies
sites :) and then continuing down the 101 through Arcata/Humboldt and
then into SF.  I'm then thinking of heading out to the Yosemite area and
stay a night there.  After that, cruise on down through mammoth lakes,
and then on down to LA, stopping at Fossil Falls (really cool place) and
then I'll be back home.

I think I'll be able to do this in, hmm.. Fly up thursday evening, go to
canada on friday via ferry, drive a little friday evening, drive on
Saturday and get to the top of CA.  Drive sunday to SF, hit the city,
drive monday through Yosemite, Tuesday drive a little more through
yosemite/mammoth, maybe stay another night, and then drop down to LA on
Wednesday.  Seem realistic?

The guy who's selling just brought his bus to the shop to have it
thoroughly check out; he wanted to be extra sure that I would make it
down (how nice!!).  He had it smog checked in WA and it passed nicely. 
He also had the CV boots replaced on one of the axles and had a little
drip from the oil filler pipe fixed.  He said he'd hook me up with a
bunch of his extras (accel cable, clutch cable, dizzy, etc.. which is
also very cool).  I'm going to bring up my toolbox too.

I think this'll be alot of fun..
