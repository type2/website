Subject: Cam plug -- Automatic trans/ manual engine

I was wondering how important it is to have the cam plug in the engine case put
in backwards to the manual trans. engines?, for installation in an automatic
trans. bus

All the factory engine's I have seen that come out of an Auto Vw have had the
cam plug installed so the smooth side goes toward the cam,,,
And the manual trans. engines have the cam plug installed so that the smooth
side faces the flywheel

I just pulled an engine out of an automatic bus,, 1.7 liter dual carb that WAS
originally from a manual trans.. 
The cam plug in the case had score marks ,, almost worn through ,, from the flex
plate hitting it

This would have been a major PITA if it had started to leak oil... as the case
has to be split to replace that plug ..... right?

My question is,,, has anyone found a way to clearance that plug ? 
I am afraid to try to dent it in with a hammer as that might cause it to leak
right away,, 

Does the engine HAVE to be split to install something that works?
