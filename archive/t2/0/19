Subject: Is it possible???

Welcom back All!
I have been dying to ask this question for 3 days.  I am looking at buying a starter for my 66 bus with 71 engine from a guy online.  He says it is compatible for ALL AIR-COOLED VW's WITH A 12 VOLTT SYSTEM.  Is this possible, or is the guy a few cabinets short of a complete Westy interior?!?!  Looking through dealer catalogs, I see that there are many more than one model  12 volt starter.  The price is right, but if it may not work, I don't want to waste my bread.



Peace, John Baker
