Lots of short run driving, 2 mile to town, work, 2 miles home, will build
up gas in the motor over time. Otherwise, verify the fuel pressure
regulator is not leaking. If that's ok, do a compression test to see if
there is more life left in that motor. Big blowby could be the reason for
the gas. Verify also the spray pattern for the injectors. And don't forget
to check the cold start valve for leaking.

On these older vehicles particularly, check that oil level every tank full.
If you see the level creeping up, you know to fix the problem before you
scour your rings and cylinders and wear out your oil pump and bearings with
diluted lubricant.
