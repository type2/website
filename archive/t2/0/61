Subject: Interior fastener


Hi Everybody,
   First of all, thanks to everyone who worked to get the Type2 site and the 
list working again.
   Now to the subject at hand.  I recently made new interior panels for our 
71 westy, and in the process found myself 2 fasteners short.  I'm talking 
about the shiny headed clips that hold the panels to the inside of the 
sliding door and rear hatch.  Does anyone have just 2 of these clips for me? 
  If so, please P-mail me and let me know how much.
   Thanks for your help, and enjoy.
