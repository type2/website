Subject: gas in oil

I pulled the engine on my '77 bus tonight and drained the oil only to find
the overwhelming stench of gasoline in the oil...yikes...

The engine is the original 2.0L FI with 162,000 miles and has never been
split....

The archives are not currnetly working so can anyone tell me what would be
the cause of gas in the oil??
