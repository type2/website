Rick Taylor and I have been discussing this offline.  There is some info at
http://www.freeze-12.com and also some links that Rick sent me:

Bottom line is that I've had the Freeze-12 in the Mustang (which is a
mineral-oil-lubricated system that previously had R-12) for a couple of
months now with no problems, and in fact it cools at least as well as it
did with the original R-12.  Time will tell if the compressor will fail
because of oil starvation but I'm not worried about it.

The 134a in my bus cools fairly well but I think the Freeze-12 might do
better so I'm going to try it.  The bus has ester lubricant so it shouldn't
suffer from the possible compressor-starvation problems that some people
are worried about.  If it doesn't work out I can just switch back to 134a
for the cost of a couple cans of refrigerant.
