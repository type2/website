Hi David,

Glad to hear that your Mustang is still cooling.  $40
per 12 ounce can seem way too high for R12.

Not sure if I mentioned it, but Freezone is supposed
to have oil (I think it's ester) in with the charge. 
This might be why it's more expensive than Freeze 12,
and why Freezone claims you don't have to add any oil.
 If you are charging a system and don't want to bother
trying to add ester oil, Freezone might be the better
choice.  Of course if you have a vacuum pump you can
pull a vacuum and rig an extra refrigerant hose to
suck in a couple ounces of ester oil.  Then after the
oil is sucked in, pull the vacuum again before
charging.

Rob
