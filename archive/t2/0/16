Subject: Jalousie Window Install Question

<Sigh> Good Morning Folks,
     Well, things were going too well with my paint job on the '77. Painted
it Friday, started putting things back together yesterday. I ordered all new
seals for the glass, but will need help putting most of it back in. It's
been my experience though that one person can install the jalousie windows,
did it on my old '76. Well last night I put one of the seals on the window
frame-seal seems to fit OK-then proceeded to scratch the %$#& out of the
sliding door around the recess where the window goes in. I've never had this
much trouble installing one of these windows. As I said, I remember doing
this before on the '76, installing these with new seals with no problem. Any
ideas? I tried coating the seal with silicone, the window still would not
fit back into place. Very frustrating! TIA, Jeff
