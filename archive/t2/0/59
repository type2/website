Subject: rheostat failure

Can't believe how my camper seems to have failure based on things that are 
discussed just weeks prior.  Just stop it already!  =)

My dimmer rheostat started to crackle and smoke yesterday.  Glad the list is 
alive again.  Is there a special tool to remove this switch so I can bridge 
the dimmer circuit?  I see how to remove the knob and it looks like a 
two-pronged golf tool would be perfect to turn the outer fastener, but if VW 
has a part number for the proper tool, I'd love to know it.  As always, 
thanks.

I suspect that the added load of my four new gauges' lights was more than 
the ancient rheostat could handle.

John
