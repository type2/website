Why buy a NEW starter when a genuine Bosch REMAN is every bit as good and
cost 30%+ less?????

If you want to give me a call at the shop tomorrow, I will look up the
proper number for you to verify. In the mean time, send me the Numbers from
your old and new starters, both the long version numbers or the Bosch
silver label code if it has one.
