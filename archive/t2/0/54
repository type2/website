Subject:  R duelin' solex dangerous to sanity?

All,
Ongoing camper hunt. Not looking to "restoration" or a perfect specimen.
A little rust, few dents, funky paint OK.  mechanically, it's gotta get me
and the kids to
and from nearby  Zions, Arches and Yellowstone N.P.s.

choices, so far:
1973. dual solex. Runs great, but no history on engine. body semi- rough,
pop-top camper unit is in GOOD shape.
guy wants $1,500--might be able to get him down.
'79 fuel injected. Westy. Rough, rusty body, awful
paint job. been sitting about a year--(gas tank needs cleaned). Replaced
clogged fuel filter and it runs strong (supposedly 30K on overhaul, but no
proof.)  $800.
'80  Vanagon L, 1,000 miles since rebuild (documented),  runs great. many
spots of surface rust. no camping equipment.

1. What's worse dual solex or fuel injection?  (I was quoted $500 and up
for dual carb rebuild.)

2. Are there reasonable folding bed units out there for the vanagon? New? Where?

Any advice/thoughts/leads appreciated.
