Subject: Baywindow Belly Pan Found at HCBF

There is a baywindow front belly pan that was found this morning on the hill in front of the the pavilion
at High Country Bus festival (or what was left of it).
Looks like it took a good beating. If you would like
it back, please p-mail me.

More on High Country to come....
