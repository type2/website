Rob et al,

I saw an ad for "Enviro-Safe" refrigerants that claim to be the equivalent 
of 18 oz. of R-12 or 16 oz. of R-134a.  Claims 100%  compatibility with both.
A 12-can case of this ES-12a is $68.00.  Order/info site is:

http://www.autorefrigerants.com

or you can call them at:

1-800-524-5987

Any BTDT?  Caveat emptor, YMMV, etc.
