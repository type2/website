  Muir has a solution for this. Involves heating the carbon with an
  oxyacetelyne torch until carbon glows. Then shut off the acetelyne
  and blast with oxygen. I've never tried it but it was in the early
  additions of the book. Muir used it on a single port manifold. I
  don't know what would happen on a dual port.
