Looking at the wiring diagram..... the only common point between all 3 is the
connecter in the steering column.

I was thinking maybe a bad ignition switch because it feeds fuses 11 and 12, but
fuse 12 feeds the hazard switch and the hazards work. The dimmer switch just
goes to ground.

Check the harness's that runs up the column. Try pushing them up the shaft. You
should find 2 harness's and 2 washer hoses. One harness is for the wipers and
the other for TS, horn, head lamps.
