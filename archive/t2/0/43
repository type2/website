Hi David,

Did you have a chance to check out your Freeze 12 on a
real hot day?  I hope it's still working for you.  I
can't seem to keep some of the blends I tried in my
old cars cooling for more than a couple weeks.

By the way, Freezone has a nice web site with info on
many types of refrigerant <www.freezonerb276.com>.  It
turns out that Freezone is almost exactly the same as
Freeze 12.  They both have about 20% HCFC 142b and 80%
R134a.  I've heard that both work well, but wanted to
hear how your Mustang is cooling these days.  I'll
have to order through the mail, and although Freezone
costs more at $10/can, I think you can buy just a few
cans to try it.
