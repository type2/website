Subject: Dead mouse removal?


UUUUGGGG.

Ok, my suspicions are confirmed ~vomits loudly in the corner~.

There is a dead mouse in my heater tube somewhere.  His nest started
spitting out of the heat vents the last few times i drove...but there was
no smell.

I stuck my head in the bus the other day (been sitting a week or so at
that time...be two weeks this next friday) and OIY.  smlled like dead
mouse.

Today the sun was out so i opened her up...she aired out decently.  But, i
started her up and turned the heat on....and in just a few minutes....OIY.
yuck.

Any suggestions for getting the bugger out? Or should i just get the
oil temp up around 220 on a nice 90+ degree day (like today...) and cook
him? maybe cooked-dead-rotten-mouse doesnt smell as bad?   Or maybe he's
already cooked and now he's a rotting dead cooked mouse. mmm.

UG.

help?
