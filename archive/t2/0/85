This came to me by p-mail from "THE SCHMIDTS" <SCHMIDT7(-at-)CORE.COM>. Respond

The Bentley does show the color codes. Get a hand glass. That's what I use
for wiring diagrams. If the stock starter had two small terminals and the
"New" candidate does not, it is not the right starter. I would send it back
with a simple explanation. I don't care what their catalog says.

Otherwise, get a spade adapter and hook them both to the one tab and see
what happens.
