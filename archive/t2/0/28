Subject: Re: Cleaning --heat riser tubes-- Intake Manifold

The single port intake manifold we removed +ACo-from an engine were replacing
that was in a bus with 110,000 original miles on it+ACo-  was plugged up with
carbon where the heat riser tubes come together.
Tried running a piece of old clutch cable through that you attach to a high
speed air tool method.  What a PITA that was.  Finally broke down, and
bought a used manifold that was clear, from: www.interstatevw.com  for big
+ACQAJAAk-.

The question is: Does anyone know of a special reaming tool that  could be
purchase to do this that would be a little safer, and more efficient.
