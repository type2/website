Subject: ADMIN.2: A few more notes.



Ok. website stuff.  the web reflectors of the list ARE down, and i have no
current ETA..I was hoping to redesign them....but we'll see.

Also, its debateable about hte archive searchs.....down. again, no ETA.

none of that software is on this box, because...well..it wasnt ready. :)
