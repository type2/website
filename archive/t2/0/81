   I am not a pilot but I am an aircraft mechanic and CO poisoning is 
something to be very much on guard against.  Sporty's pilot shop and most 
airport shops where planes are serviced sell a small (2" square or so) 
passive CO detector.  This is self adhesive and can be mounted on the dash.  
It is a plastic panel with a circle of chemical that is yellowish white in 
the center.  When exposed to CO it turns brown to black and is good for 
several months.  They sell for about $5.00.
