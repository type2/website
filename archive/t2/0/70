Just a warning, remember a year or so ago when others had this problem?  At
that time people warned of certain diseases or germs that the mouse nests and
bodies carried.  I would be concerned about this if your bus is any where near
air tight.  Fortunately mine isn't even close.  It only sucks in the
winter.....:(
