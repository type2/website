Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Dead mouse removal?

I'd try a plumber's snake.  You can get a small one quite cheaply at any =
hardware store.  If the mouse is too stuck in there to push out, the final =
1 - 2 inches of the snake is loosely twisted and resembles a corkscrew.  =
If worse comes to worse, you could thread the mouse onto this and pull it =
out.  Once you get the mouse out, use a rag soaked with bleach or vinegar =
on the end of the snake to clean off any baked on mouse bits and slime and =
disinfect + deodorize the whole thing. =20

Also, I'd suggest a bandanna wetted with vinegar over your mouth and nose =
against the odor.  I don't want to read a "[VB] Best methods for removing =
vomit from hard to reach corners?" thread.

Finally, just be glad you've never had to clean up after a shotgun =
suicide.  My dad owned a carpet cleaning service and I had to help out on =
one of those.  A rotting mouse is much nicer to deal with.
