Subject: ADMIN:  sending mail to listname-digest(-at-)


Hey folks.

Watching the logs, i've tracked down another previously unknown problem.

mail directed to type2-digest(-at-) and vintagebus-digest(-at-) does /not/ work.  As
those who have send it have seen.

Please redirect that mail to type2(-at-) or vintagebus(-at-) until i find a solution
to this.

sorry.

..david
