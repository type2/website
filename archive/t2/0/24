Subject: Re: Hot start relay --install instructions--70 bus

Would have pulled this from the archives but it's still down.

We are having starting problems after engine has been warmed up, and then
shut down. It turns over very slowly. It's a new 1600 dual port with +ACo-just
installed+ACo- electronic ignition.

Does any one have the instructions for installing the hot start relay?
