Need to know about a lot of things to know if this is a bargain or to run
away. If the solexes have worn shafts, they can be bushed but it is spendy.
If they have been bushed before and not done right and are worn again,
they's toast. Walk away unless you have a grand or so for a proper 40 IDF
Weber set up. Four CV's worn out will cost you $700 p/l/t at my shop.
Tranny could be good or give out soon. Look for filthy, dirty fluid there.
Same for the brakes. If it just had new rear wheel cylinders, could be
rebuild of front calipers in the near future and/or the master cylinder. 

If you inspect the vehicle thoroughly or have it done, you likely can
identify more price negotiable evidence, or rule the vehicle out all
together. A standard compression test will tell you most of what you need
to know about the engine.

Make danged sure on this one that all the original carb
hardware/tubes/linkages are there and hooked up right. Get someone who
knows verify that if you can't yourself. Make sure it's got the stock
distributor. If it doesn't have a fat vacuum can on it, it's not stock and
you really need one. A new one is over $300 I'm sure.

No proof overhaul is not good. Check the crankshaft endplay and compression
or assume a proper engine will be needed soon. One of the worst things you
can do to FI is let it sit till the gas goes sour and varnishes up the pump
and lines and injectors. I would charge 5 or 6 hours to remove the tank,
clean it, recoat the inside with a proprietory substance and reinstall it.
While the motor is out, you will then have the oportunity to buy some
clutch parts if they look like they won't last too much longer. 

When I add the rusty body to this one, well, if it's full of camping
equipment in good order, the $800 might not be that far off.

Documented???? What is the reputation of the shop who did the work??? Are
they know to have lots of experience with VW air cooled designs?? Do they
do the machine work in house or do they obtain long blocks from another
rebuilder??? Who??? What is their reputation??

Compression test/end play test is prudent if it did not come from a highly
reputed VW savy machine shop.

Surface rust, if that is all it really is, will just take a bit of
preventative maintenance to slow WAY down, if you get to it right away and
don't mind patches of not so close tints for repair.

>1. What's worse dual solex or fuel injection?  

Wornout carbs are the pits. Contaminated FI systems are the pits. Carbs in
good order and adjusted right drive REAL nice. FI systems in good order and
adjusted right drive REAL nice, and give you a wider power band and cleaner
running. The later 2 liters have lots more power and probably get every bit
as good of milage as an earlier carbed 1.7 or 1.8.

It will be a bit easier to find people competant with the FI than those
experienced with the T-II dual carbs. 

>(I was quoted $500 and up for dual carb rebuild.)

I would provide carb kits and install and adjust them for $375. These guys
may be a little apprehensive and expect to take more time. Or, noting that
a whole lot of carbs on Asian vehicles cost over $700 to replace, their
minimums seem reasonable as far as their normal market goes. I wouldn't let
them touch those carbs unless they can show me some past invoices that
proves they have experience with VW carbs, and hopefully with the dual carb
T-II. It's a very unique setup with plenty of pitfalls for the unknowing.
Anyone with Bosch electronic FI experience will not be stranger to what he
finds on the FI T-II's or Vanagons.
