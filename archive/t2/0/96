Subject: Re: [T2] Grinding into second gear.

after reading the email I wrote, I thought would probably be nice of me
to just explain it instead of telling you to buy a book..

So, I pulled out the bentley, but after reading the section, I don't
think I can explain it without being really confusing :)  

Anyone else out there have a good description of how to adjust the stick
shift and the stop plate?

but yes, if you haven't already gotten it, go buy the bentley.  It'll
save you alot of time and grief.

Mike

p.s. I should've just kept my mouth shut and kept on reading...
hmmmmmmmmmm. <G>
