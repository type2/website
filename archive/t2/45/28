If the upper engine hatch is latched correctly, how can you get in
throught it?  You need not break a window- if a louvre window is open,
push a screen corner out and reach either the door button or the sliding
door lock.  If closed and you have pull up lock buttons, get a coat
hanger or piece of house wiring and either a small prybar or giant
screwdriver.  Gently pry the front door  away from the door post just
below the top corner, and reach the wire through the gap, having bent a
loop in it to grip the door locking knob.
