Subject: next question, auxillary battery?

hello all,

first off, i would like to thank Sean Bartnik, Clark W
GriZwald, Bob, and Jim for there help with my last
question. i hope that someday i might know enough to
repay them.

however, now ive got another question, a little less
urgent. whats the deal with the auxillary battery in
the 76 westy. does anyone know how this system works?
does the alternator charge both main and auxillary
batteries? what is powered by the auxillary battery.
any insight would be greatly appreciated. me +
electrical anything = scratching of head. thanks
again.   -matty
