Subject: Head Temp Sensor

There's been a lot of chat about the head temp sensor lately. A friend of 
mine came over with her 78 westy (we originally met due to AIRS). She has 
been having some wierd problems with low idle and the motor dying at 
stoplights. i figured i would just spin the head sensor and make sure it was 
tight. When i wiggled it, it came out. Seems it was wrapped in a spring and 
stuffed into a hole that was MUCH larger than stock head sensor diameter. 
Now, what do i do?
I was thinking:
1. i could JB WELD the sensor in (cheap, not very professional)
2. leave the sensor off and just unhook it (probably not a good idea)
3. Ask for some advice.
ANY Thoughts?
Thanks
-jeremy
