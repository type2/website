Subject: 2 68's and a 71

 I just went and looked at 3 buses for sale. All are pretty much rust free
and very repairable

1. 68 pop top westy
2. 68 high roof westy
3  71 hardtop westy

2 of them have engines, all have trannys. Interiors pretty complete on all
of them. The high roof is the cleanest of the 3.
  No major rust on any of them. Will require minor body work if you want
cherry or make run and drive as is. 

owner wants to sell all three as a package, he also has 5 others coming up
for sale when these are gone, all 72 and later campers, coditions unknown at
this time.
