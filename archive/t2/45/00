Hello,

http://www.gowesty.com/pics/211-827-503L.jpg

Go westy has them brand new, for about $60. Seems like a high price until
you lose more than that in parts someday. I know I always feel better in
certain areas with my engine hatch locked.

It fits the 72-79 bay busses, part  #211-827-503L.

Best,
Christopher
