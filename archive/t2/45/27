Subject: Re: [T2] On FI

Hi Bob,
I wasn't talking about the current FI that VW uses for
it's Brazilian products.
I was referring specifically to the 70's FI on buses
and Type 3's.
I would like to find out what the current stuff
is,yes.
Have you got any more details on it?
I can get my hands on a free Type 3 TLE engine
tomorrow if I want it from a friend who found it so
much trouble he changed to carbs.
What's the new system like?
I know it's being used in Europe and the UK on their
Brazillian imports.
Of course scoring it in Australia for a decent price
is another thing entirely:-/
Cheers
Andrew
