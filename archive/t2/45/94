Subject: Re:  GoWesty 15" tire and wheel package

>>The steel wheels on the site can be gotten from one
of the wheel/tire wholesalers. They sell them as part
of a winter tire /steel wheel package for the Mercedes
too. You can get just the wheels. Don't mention that
they are going on a VW bus because they will lock up
and not discuss them with you.

No luck with archive search.  I hate that archive.  I
cannot browse past months, and the search feature is
useless.  

Anyone know of a source for these steel 15" for
cheaper than gowesty?  I assume you have to use longer
lug nuts?

Thanks,
Ray
