I agree with you on a show truck or one that is in great condition. A lot of
people with a VW in that great condition don't use it as a daily driver. Its
all a matter of personal preference.


I actually replaced my panels with wood from the hardware store and have my
pristine originals stored safely away in case I ever change my mind.
Actually in all the modifications I have done, I retained my originals. If I
had the original curtains I might consider going back.
