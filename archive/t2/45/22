Subject: thermostat in '71 1600 air cleaner

Thanks to continuous advice from the list, I finished the rebuild of my
1776 and started it on my test stand Saturday.  It runs smoothly.  Looking
ahead to next weekend when I hope to put the engine in my bus, I tested the
thermostat in my stock air cleaner.  I heated it with a heat gun but could
not make the plunger move to open the intake flap.  I removed it from the
cleaner, removed the plunger, and poured various cleaners into the little
hole in the hope that the plunger might have been binding.

Unfortunately, I must have left a few drops in there. The next time I
heated it, the plunger was launched twenty feet across the garage!  Well,
maybe it was not binding.  In any event, I doubt if I'll ever find it in
the rubble.

My questions:
1. Can anyone explain the mechanism inside the thermostat? It must be more
than a bimetallic strip.  The force on the plunger must be quite strong to
counteract that long spring.

2. Does anyone happen to have a thermostat + plunger to sell me?

Thanks, jack
