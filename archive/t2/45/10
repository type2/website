Subject: RE: Locking engine hatch

Hi all,
  I got the $15 lock from JC Whiteny... yeah I know
all about the problems with them.  Anyway the only
mods  that I needed to do was make a slight cutout for
the 3rd screw at the bottom.  If I went back to a
stock latch you'd have never known the difference. 
The only problem was that the key was different, but
that didn't bother me at all... at least I knew my
engine was safe.
  My bus was a 1970, and after sinking all the money I
did into it and the thought of my ex and his buddies
coming over and stealing parts made me nervous (they
had a 70 also)
  Good luck safegarding your engines!
-Dawn
