Subject: FW: getting in to locked bus

Hi Mike,

I think you might be able to grab the bottom of the latches and twist them
around if you had a set of pliers and remembered which way to turn them.

This would never work with my bus, I leave too many toolboxes and things
back there.

.... It's not just a mess, it's also an anti-theft device!

I've jimmied lots of automotive door locks (not for profit, just for
stupidity, I'll have you know!) but the case in question here WASN'T me.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
