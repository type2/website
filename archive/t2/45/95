Not trying to bust yo chops here, but if I remember from my Thermodynamics
class, the Ideal Gas Law states: PV=nRT.  Which means that Pressure
increases as Temperature increases, and vice-versa... Pressure decreases as
Temperature decreases.

Practical knowledge is ten times more useful than theory, so I might be
wrong here... just trying to clarify.
