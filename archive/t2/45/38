Hi all,
I am doing my rear wheel bearings tomorrow, I already have the bearings and
the seals.  Any special tools I will need?  I still need to get the grease.

Also I just ordered a Bosch 050 to replace my 009.  But my distributor is
out 180 degrees and I just read on the list that this distributor won't work
180 degrees out (hits something)  Is there a special tool to fix this
problem?  I have heard if you mess up turning the gear around it is a VERY
BAD thing.

This is all on a 73 bus..

TIA
