>Sorry but any Fireman approaching a VW bus will not 
open the lid... Firemen will approach

vent intake. The lid keeps o2 from the 
fire. 

Right.  The spray underneath (in an upward arch) as
well.  Most fireman are told to avoid putting water
products on VW's as it will help the magnesium blocks.
 They won't care even if yours is a T4 engine or even
if most engine fires don't get hot enough to ignite
the mag.  

>>Besides if its on fire I don't think you can go 
near that lid, too dame hot!

You won't get near the vehicle at all.  Even a small
engine fire puts off enough heat to make it impossible
to approach even in firefighter bunker gear until the
fire is knocked down.   Remember that some fool may
have disconnected improperly wired your fuel pump to
run even if the ignition is off.  Also, I've heard
that the gas tank is just in front (FIF) of the
engine...  Wonder what happens when it gets too hot?

Most cars have secure engine bonnets-- er hoods. 
(Sorry, been reading Haynes too much.)  If the
firefighters need in, they'll use a pry type tool and
get in.  

The chances of getting your carb, battery or other
engine components are probably greater than your
engine igniting IF you have replaced your fuel
lines--REPLACE YOUR DAMN FUEL LINES, and lock your
engine compartment if you wish.
