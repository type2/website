Subject: RE: [T2] How hot is HOT?

You are exactly right, but your application is wrong,
for several reasons:

1. Oil is not a gas.
2. Engine oil pressure is not a result of heating the
oil. 

The reason that in this case oil pressure is inversely
proportional to engine temperature (this is an
enormous oversimplification, but for these purposes,
it still works) is that lower oil pressure yields less
lubrication. Less lubrication means more friction.
More friction, of course, means more heat. Temperature
is a measure of heat. (Actually, it's a measure of the
kinetic energy of particles of a substance, expressed
as heat energy.)Thus, lower oil pressure yields higher
temperatures, all other factors being equal.
