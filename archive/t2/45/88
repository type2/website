Subject: Re: [T2]  locking engine hatch + FIRES NOT TRUE

Hi John Here
 Sorry but any Fireman approaching a VW bus will not open the lid, so don't 
worry about the lock. I lock mine because of my security system is back 
there. I know when I am on the move my lid is not locked because I usually 
check the oil before I move out. Firemen will approach and shoot foam or 
other material through the engine vent intake. The lid keeps o2 from the 
fire. Besides if its on fire I don't think you can go near that lid, too dame 
hot!
