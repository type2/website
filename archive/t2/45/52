Subject: idle stab control unit

Hello Type 2 list,
Allot of knowledge out there- here's a hard one for you really experienced
folks: 

Has anyone out there ever replaced a "points" style distributor with a later
air cooled vanagon 2.0 ltr hall effect distributor with the Idle
stabilization control unit (VW part number: 251-907-393D or 251-906-083)?
	
	I'm just curious if the  idle stab control can be adapted to a
points style engine, and if it makes much of a difference.....

Thanks Much -
Paul
