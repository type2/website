You really have to smash it in there.  The key is to not let the gas
attendant over fill or pump it yourself if you can get away with it.
Here in NJ, they get jumpy because its illegal to self serve.

actually that is caused by having pumps set for the smaller unleaded gas
 fills , and most buses have the bigger leaded filler.  
 If they put em in a little differently they won't stay on??
