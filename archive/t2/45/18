Hi Mike,

One of the members of a local VW club locked himself out of his 1974 bus
recently at the side of the road, and he actually managed to re-enter the
bus through the rear and upper engine hatches!!!

He had to remove the upper fan, air cleaner & carb linkages to pull it pff,
but it was certainly preferable to breaking a window to get in.

I haven't met him in person, but I expect he must be pretty skinny. ;^)

Sometime soon I'm going to install a simple sliding pin lock on the inside
of the lid, connected to a cable release on the upper lid. Simple, but
effective. I want to put a interior release on the rear hatch as well.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
