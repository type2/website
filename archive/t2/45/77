The stock FI boss on the 2.0 heads is NOT the place for the sensor. I have
DYNO tested the results on the same engine, same gauge with exact
atmospheric conditions.

The difference was near 50 degrees, and the time it took for responses to
the gauge was almost 3 times slower than with the sensor attached to the
spark plug, where it should be.
