This is really easy.  I just did it with instructions from George Lyle on
rekeying the lock.

First, get a used rear window hatch lock from the junkyard.  Make sure you
can push the button in, i.e. it is in the unlocked position.  If you take
off the trim panel on the inside, you'll see there's a single phillips head
bolt holding it in on the bottom of the lock.

At the rear of the lock is are two little holes.  When you push the lock
button, the pin that holds the cyllinder with the lock body lines up with
these holes.  You need to push the pin out through the holes.  Easiest way
is to chuck a small punch, or failing that, a finishing nail, in the drill
press and use it to push the pin through.

Now you'll find that when you stick the key in, the ends of the little brass
plates in the cyllinder stick up.  You want to reassort these plates until
they don't stick up, and if you have to dispense with a recalcitrant plate
or two, don't let it bother you.

Once that's done, you can switch it for the non-locking cyllinder in your
engine latch, and viola! you've got a lock.
