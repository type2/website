Subject: FS '78 Sunroof Bus in Bay Area

Listees,
There is a 1978 Sunroof Bus in need of a good home located here in the
bay area.  A former 'dot-com'  was exploiting the bus for mobile advertising,
and now it's no longer needed.  The bus is straight, a little rust around
the sunroof opening and the lower quarterpanels, has all it's parts,
stock and running 2.0L FI motor, decent and complete interior, still
registered.  The bus does have logos on it, and silkscreening across
the side and rear windows, nothing that can't be fixed with a little
Easy Off oven cleaner and a razor blade.
If anyone is interested, contact me 'off list' and make an offer.


Later,
