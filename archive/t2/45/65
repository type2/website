Subject: How hot is HOT?

Hello All,

New VW bus owner here... Just put in a VDO cylinder temperature sensor and
it works great.  I just can't find any information on "How hot is HOT?"  I
did see an advertisement for another cylinder head sensor that shuts off the
engine when it reaches 425F.  I've gotten it up to 450F and everything seems
fine.  This particular sensor goes all the way up to 600F with no red zone.

I don't feel so HOT,
J. Scott Allen
74 Westy (Loafy)

BTW:  I do live in Texas where it can get up to 120F easily in August!
