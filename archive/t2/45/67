Subject: Vacuum advance: dizzy requirements vs. actual vacuum

Hi bussers:

Anyone have any idea what should be the vacuum produced by a stock 1600sp at various rpms & throttle conditions?  I have a dizzy that requires 30cm Hg for full 
advance, but my vacuum takeoff on the side of the carb doesn't seem to suck much more than 15cm.  Trying to figure out if that's low.  If I have an intake leak I 
guess that might explain low vacuum *and* hesitation coming off idle?

Thanks,
Joe Clark
