If it 'fits' 72 to 79......that is wrong. 72 to about 75 were all chrome. About
76 to 79 were black.

If any one wants a REAL one. I have lots of them, each with 2 keys. The keys are
not original VW but aftermarket cut to code.
I have all bay years. If anyone wants an early 70's one, you need to specify L
code or R code and whether the hook has a curve in it or it is straight. I have
lots of type1 ones also, one screw and 3 screw.  $20 each + postage from Fresno,
Calif.
