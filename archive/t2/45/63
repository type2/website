 Hmm, the tyres they suggest are the wrong size and are marginal in terms
of load rating. Their information is a little misleading, IMHO, since the
description of the bus tyre requirements as "extraordinary" is inaccurate
and the recommendation for "reinforced" tyres simply wrong (reinforced
tyres are the minimum spec. appropriate for lightly loaded busses, not
campers or panel vans). Type-2s should run on 185R14C tyres- a commercial
vehicle rating, not a reinforced car tyre.
 Their claim for improved handling is questionable- I suspect it reflects
an improvement on inappropriate tyres on 14" wheels- ie our crap is better
than the crap you have now!!!

 185R14C tyres are made by all the major manufacturers- there are any
number of alternatives available in Europe, Asia, Oceania and Latin 
America. Don't let people bullshit you.

 Tirerack.com list half a dozen 185R14Cs- the Michelin Agilis, Bridgestone
603V, Dunlop SP LT5 (I've used these- they're fine), Yoko Y356 and a 
Goodyear Wrangler. In various ratings/tread patterns with prices from $63
to $100.

 Get the right rubber- your bus will love you for it....

Cheers,
        W.
(Agilis 81s, since you ask).
