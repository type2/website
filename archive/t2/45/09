Subject: ignition switch glitch

hi all - ignition switch had been tempermental on my 68 from day one, and
last week it wouldn't give for about two days, no click - no idiot lights
dimming, so:

i changed out my ignition switch last weekend. the starter and solenoid had
tested good and tests for the ignition switch failed, so it was an easy
one. with the recent switch in, i soon found i have the same problem i had
with the last switch: more than half the time i need to find the sweet-spot
with the key to get the starter to turn over. is this a telltale sign the
ignition lock is wearing out and i need to replace it?   TIA - steve
