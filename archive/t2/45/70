Check to make sure that: #1 she doesn't have fuel injector seals that are 
leaking (or any vacuum leaks) and #2 that her EGR valve is not leaking.

Those were two problems I had when I got my bus and I had the same symptoms.

There has to be a good electrical connection from the wire to sensor to 
head. Put a new connection on the wire and if the sensor won't screw in and 
stay in then have a Heli-coil or Time-sert installed. Then screw in the 
sensor per factory install.
