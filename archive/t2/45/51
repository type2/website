Subject: Radio Speakers

I know most people like the Rockin' stereo system, but what is wrong with
replacing the under dash stock speaker with a $10.00 radio shack replacement
speaker?
I did exactly that to avoid cutting holes in my 32 year old pristine door
panels. But, if you want to butcher your panels, it's your truck.
I have in the past, put a stereo in the glove box, made a couple of plywood
boxes, put 6x9 speakers in them and ran wire to the back of the bus.  You
can move them anywhere at will, and you don't have to hack holes in the
interior.
