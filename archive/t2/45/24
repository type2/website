Don't recall the year of your system, but if it has an idle switch on the
throttle body, check that. Adjustment or replacement of the idle switch
could solve the problem. Early versions were just a cherry switch on top of
the throttle body that you might find at Radio Shack. Later verison were
mounted under the t-body and must be obtained from VW or a German importer.

If the idle switch doesn't tell the ECU you are at idle, is can cause your
symptom. All it takes is an ohm meter to test it, or you could just throw
money at it and hope that's it. Know that whenever you replace any of these
FI sensors/switches/relays/ect., the system must be recalibrated/adjusted
for idle and mixture. Just running lean under new correct signals from a
replaced device could also cause your symptom. This is why it is VERY
important to follow diagnostic steps in order without skipping anything if
you don't want to waste money on unnecessary parts and still have
troubleshooting to do.

I can only advise to go back and complete all the steps skipped thus far
before going further. The problem still could be poor pressure/volume
because that has yet to be verified.
