Subject: Rear hatch lock

Hello all,

With all this talk of the engine hatch lock, I thought perhaps one of you
might know where I can find a rear hatch lock (not sure if that's what it's
properly termed--the hatch above the engine hatch) for a '78. My key turns
the lock, but the hatch won't budge an inch. My repair shop suggested
installing a new lock, which seems sensible enough. Any idea where I can
order one online, or elsewhere for that matter?

Thanks!
