Hi John Here
I know I might catch some heat on this one. Well, here we go. Fuel injection 
is great,
when as a system it works. Something happens during that rebuild its always 
something. On the other hand if your an ace with the electronics or just 
really comfortable with it no problem. Everyone else stick with the Carbs
