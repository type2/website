Subject: Warnign do not open any attchments from me (very slight bus content)

If anyone gets anything from me with an attachment do not open...  I am not
sending and I am having a virus problem that I am trying to get under
control.. Hopefully I will have it fixed this afternoon.  fingers crossed.

Sorry for the inconvenience

(bus Content)
I am sure glad my bus does not have a computer....
