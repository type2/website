How should I set the advance on this distributor?

113 AA fits 68 bug auto-stick. It is listed here:

Click on 'beetle 68 auto stick'.

> Also, I have around the garage.... 113 905 205 T ,  043 905 205 , and a few
009s I know, I know.

Same source as above....
113T is 69-70 bug n bus.......
043 905 205 is bug MT federal 1974.....
009's are door stops.....

which of these would be most suitable for my 1600 dp with Webber prog.,
extractor header, and
Pertronics points eliminator, for my 70' Kobi with a M.T.
