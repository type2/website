Subject: Cool tool:  IR thermometer

I think that someone has mentioned this before, but I just bought an
infrared thermometer and thought the list would have fun with it.

The IR thermometer is a non-contact device.  You just point it at a
surface and push a button and you have the temp on the display.  For oil
temperature, just aim it at the sump.  CHT?  aim it at the head.  Some
parts of the muffler are over 500F at idle!

You can also measure how cold your intake is and see if the heat riser is
working directly.

Limitations are that the temperature is measured over a area about 1 inch
across, so you can't measure small objects.

You can also pinpoint bad wheel bearings and CVs (they run hotter),
determine if McDonalds coffee is up to lawsuit standards, etc.

When you get one of these you spend about an hour running around measuring
everything's temperature.  Lotsa fun!
