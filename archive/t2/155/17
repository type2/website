Tom,

On a type IV motor the flaps are essential.  Without them, the fan does
not push air through the oil cooler.  You *can* live without the
thermostat, but your new motor will not live long without the flaps...

Remember Kettering's words... "Parts left out cost nothing and have an
infinite service life."  If the motor didn't NEED those parts, VW
wouldn't have spent the money to put them there.  If you mechanic
doesn't understand their importance, it's time to find a new mechanic.
(Or become your own mechanic!)
