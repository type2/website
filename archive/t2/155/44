Subject: Cool tools

I got this link from another list that I am on for my motorcycle, but I
think some of these tools could also be useful for aircooled VW's.  In
particular I am interested in checking out the ColorTune test plugs and
maybe the EZ Bleed system.  I haven't used any of these tools personally,
but thought other listees might be interested in checking them out...
