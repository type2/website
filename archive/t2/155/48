Subject: Re: [T2] Couple of air circulation questions

Howdy,

The wind noise you're hearing is probably from the fresh air vents, and is 
probably a result of the flap not closing all the way.  This flap is behind 
the grille under the windshield.  It was sealed with foam around the edges, 
and the foam deteriorates over the years and doesn't seal very well anymore. 
  I duct taped mine closed and use my vent windows and door windows for 
ventilation.  If you want to go with the stock setup, however, you can run a 
bead of silicone around the flaps and try to get them to seal that way.  
While you're in there, you may also want to adjust the actuator rod so the 
vents are fully closed when the blue lever is all the way up.

As for the 1.5-2" dia tube under the belly pan, I'm not really sure what it 
is without more information.  Is it a vertical tube or a horizontal one?  
Does it come from the front of the Bus or the rear?  It sounds a little too 
big to be a water drain, but it could be a water drain for the fresh air 
ducts.

Hope this info helps.  Good luck!
