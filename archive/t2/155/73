Racers use these devices as you noted, as well as for tire temperatures. 
There are lots of them in the pits. 
Since I hang out with these folks, I have seen other uses. We gave one to a 5 
year old in the pits, and someone took a picture of him checking the temp of 
a dog's hind end. 
It took 30 minutes for the laughing to stop.
