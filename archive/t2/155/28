You will need a few more parts to make this work correctly:
Both front lower cylinder tin.
Both lower tin.
Both air tubes that go thru the upper cylinder tin to the boxes.
The 72-74 alt support.


       Does the 72-74 alt support bracket bolt to the R/H heat =
exchanger? My 73's bracket is there but has been cut off where it =
attaches to the heater box.=20
I've got new boxes coming from Bus Depot so will see if there's an a =
attachment for the bracket.
