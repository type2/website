Subject: Clearing (cleaning) house time!

I'm getting rid of a buncha extras that I've collected over the years. 
I've got rear z-bed seat cushions from a pre-76 westy that I'm going to
toss.  I'm also going to have interior stuff like an extra fridge (dunno
if it works or not) and probably some more stuff.

My apartment is looking like a rat's nest so I gotta clean stuff up! 
I'm in Long Beach, CA.

EMAIL me directly ASAP at msoultan(-at-)csulb.edu because I'm on the digest
and might miss your reply!  I'm going to be tossing this stuff soon if
nobody snags it.

later,
Mike
