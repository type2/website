Why won't this mechanic listen to your wishes. You are paying him $ to
install & hook up properly. Properly is per the Bentley. Bentley
doesn't say any where "throw those flaps away, they really don't do
anything". As a client of yours, he should listen to your wishes. even
if he doesn't agree. You are not asking him to preform some crazy
preformance mod that might cause him to have to guarantee something
that he can't. All you are asking is him to properly install a temp
control system for an engine. 

BTW Joe at Bustedbus might be a good resource for this part.
