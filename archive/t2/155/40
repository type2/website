Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel Filter question, re-usable

Speaking of fuel filters... in my studies of late 67 H-case motors for the
preparation of the tipper for the road trip to the octo/classic weekend,
I've noticed that many factory pictures show motors that don't have a filter
to begin with... what gives?

>>John asked:   While picking up brakes for my 71 Westy, I saw and bought a
re-usable fuel filter made by BugPack.  It's the glass kind with the
replaceable screen inside. My question: Has anyone used these, and if so, do
they leak or clog easily?? Adversely, do they filter finely enough?
