I am getting a wind noise from the defost vents. Not all the time, but =
it seems most prominent around
60 mph and when there is a cross wind. Is a flap that is supposed be =
closed opening ???

When doing some other work, I pulled off the pan under the pedals. I =
noticed a plastic tube about
1.5 -2 inches diameter that does not go anywhere it just ends there. Is =
this some sort of recirculation?=20
Is this hose/tube related to my first question? TIA
