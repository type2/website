Um - then why does my '78 2.0 with '73 heat exchangers and tin works so 
good....

Not poking at you - just that your statement is 180 degrees out from 
everything I've read and heard which says if you have all the old '72-'74 
parts and tin that it is a bolt on conversion...

Also the heads don't dictate the lifter style used - it's a pushrod length 
thing. The heads don't know or care about the lifters. I think the pushrods 
are a different length for hydraulic and solid lifters. It's a drop in 
conversion except that the camp ought to be renewed at the same time and 
for that you have to split the block.

Anyone want to set me straight if I'm wrong?
