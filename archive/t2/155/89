Dear list,
I can't thank you enough for giving me the courage to make what I knew =
was right actually happen for my bus.
After the list, again, proved that the cooling flaps/thermostat on the =
air cooled engines are there for a good reason, I found the flaps and =
linkage at Busted Bus. (Thanks again, Joe!)
He will send these to my mechanic who was told the reason for the flaps =
was to send needed cooling air over the oil cooler. He stated that most =
of the engines he works on are bug engines and he thanked me for =
teaching him this.

I will not say that he is not a good mechanic. He is doing an excellent =
job of checking everything on my engine and exhaust/heater system. We =
just had the old "in or out" disagreement that VW people have been =
having for years. Maybe now, though, the wisdom of a few years =
experience tells us that "in" is the only way to go.
I can't thank this list enough for helping me to realize a 10 year long =
dream of finally having my bus in a very well restored condition.

Peace to all, and a special thanks to all who replied to me on this.
We should all also thank Joe at Busted Bus, John at aircooled.net and =
Ron at Bus Depot for all they continue to do for us. Without them, and =
our busses, my life, at least would be a bit less happy.
