Subject: FRIDAY - Water Injection System

Hi Folks,

I was thinking again (always dangerous) about helping the aircooled engine 
run cooler and came up with an idea that I wanted to bounce off of The List. 
  In lieu of spending up to $250 for an external oil cooler and dealing with 
the mounting and thermostat issues, I was thinking about alternatives that 
help keep the notoriously-hot T4 engine cooler.

I was driving in the rain yesterday, and noticed that my engine temps were 
much lower than they usually are on this same route.  I got to thinking (see 
first sentence) about the cooling and evaporative effects that water has on 
the aircooled engine, and wondered if the "rainy day" condition could be 
replicated on dry days.  I live at 8,000 feet elevation, and the air up here 
is very dry and pretty thin, so its cooling effectiveness is not as great as 
it is in thick, humid air environs.

My "rainy day" theory is that road spray on the bottom of the oil sump adds 
more cooling, which makes the oil cooler.  Also, the increased humidity 
(both from rain and road spray) gets pulled into the fan where its 
evaporative effects add more cooling to the cylinders and oil cooler.

I came up with the idea of a "water injection system" which goes something 
like this:  A windshield washer reservoir on the left-side battery tray with 
a low-pressure pump that could be actuated by a momentary switch on the 
dash.  A hose runs from the reservoir to the tin in front (RIF) of the fan, 
where water would drip onto the tin and get sucked into the fan.  Water 
droplets would either flash into steam or get atomized by the fan, get blown 
over the cylinders, and add humidity and density to the cooling air.

It all seems to work (in theory), but I'm sure there are problems with 
localized cooling and different rates of metal expansion and contraction.  
Anybody care to jump in on this one?

Thanks for listening,
