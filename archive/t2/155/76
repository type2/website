Subject: replacing a poptop seal?

Hello all; 

I have a newly purchased 1971 Westy that is in need of a new front poptop
seal...I purchased the seal (the one with the clips embedded into the
rubber), but I can't seem to find any  specific info on it...maybe because
this is such an easy job, but hey...it's my first campmobile...

If anyone can give me a rundown on procedure for removal/cleaning
(?)/refit the new seal, I would be most grateful. 

Thanks in advance; 

Dan Curran
