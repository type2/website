Dear list,
I am having a rebuilt AVP engine installed in my 73 Westy by a local, =
very reputable VW mechanic.
The engine itself arrived in excellent condition. The problem is that a =
PO of my bus disabled the thermostat flaps, in fact, the left side flap =
is missing. I need to locate a used set of flaps. Can anyone assist me =
in this?
The other part of this question is the oft-debated question of "should =
the thermostat be connected...". My mechanic insists that here in the =
South Texas heat, the answer is 'no', and he is not going to connect my =
(new) thermostat or locate the needed flaps. He is doing an otherwise =
excellent job of installation and is also going the extra mile of =
redoing my gas tank, heat exchangers and exhaust. I plan on trying the =
engine out without the thermostat and flaps, and putting them back in =
later, if the list advises so.
Also, does anyone know of a source for the rubber elbow, approx 13 =
inches long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter, that connects from the filler =
neck to the gas tank on this 73 bus? I cannot locate one anywhere. I =
tried Busted Bus to no avail. A section of regular fuel tubing did not =
work, because of the bend needed (kept kinking). Any suggestions?
Thanks very much,
Tom Adams
73 Westy  "Chris" (soon to be back on the road!)
