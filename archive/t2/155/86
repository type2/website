If their history is unknown, get new ones. About the third time you 
re-stretch them, you will have cracks in the convolutions. Even first time 
stretching of used sets can create fatigue cracks easily after being heat 
cycled 5 or 10 thousand times. Replace them to insure no issues with your 
fresh motor for the life of the motor.

My submittal was focused upon no tolerance for leaks. New tubes is the 
simple-minded way to eliminate risks. This is in fact one of the reasons 
GEX gets a bad rating. They reuse tubes and some will leak right out of the 
box. Just one of the many risks of their motors due to poor procedures 
generally.

Keep the seams up, new or used.
