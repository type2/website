Tom,

We have these flaps, pieces or sets. The problem is the thermostat. They are
available just really expensive. As for the filler neck hose, I found you a
great used one with absolutely no cracks give me a call.

Dear list,
I am having a rebuilt AVP engine installed in my 73 Westy by a local, very
reputable VW mechanic.
The engine itself arrived in excellent condition. The problem is that a PO
of my bus disabled the thermostat flaps, in fact, the left side flap is
missing. I need to locate a used set of flaps. Can anyone assist me in this?
The other part of this question is the oft-debated question of "should the
thermostat be connected...". My mechanic insists that here in the South
Texas heat, the answer is 'no', and he is not going to connect my (new)
thermostat or locate the needed flaps. He is doing an otherwise excellent
job of installation and is also going the extra mile of redoing my gas tank,
heat exchangers and exhaust. I plan on trying the engine out without the
thermostat and flaps, and putting them back in later, if the list advises
so.
Also, does anyone know of a source for the rubber elbow, approx 13 inches
long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter, that connects from the filler neck to the
gas tank on this 73 bus? I cannot locate one anywhere. I tried Busted Bus to
no avail. A section of regular fuel tubing did not work, because of the bend
needed (kept kinking). Any suggestions?
Thanks very much,
Tom Adams
73 Westy  "Chris" (soon to be back on the road!)
