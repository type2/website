Subject: Re: [T2] Engine won't start - ideas?

Can you verify whether or not you're getting power to the coil? Pull out a 
plug, with the wire still on and the threads grounded to the exhaust pipe, 
have someone crank the engine...spark? If not, you might replace disconnect 
your coil and shake it around. You might have pieces of wire in their where 
your coil used to be...
Food for tought...
