What you are creating here is an evaporative cooler for your engine.
Certainly a viable concept.

Your engine rejects about 100Kw of heat, or 100,000J/s.  It takes 2259000J
to vaporize a kilogram (liter) of water.  Therefore, the heat output of
your engine is capable of vaporizing a liter of water in about 23
seconds if the water is the only source of cooling.

Of course, you're just supplimenting the cooling of the air, so you won't
need nearly so much water, but I don't think that a windshield washer
reservoir and pump will last long.

The motorhome people have systems that spray water on their radiators to
cool their engines on grades, but they are pulling water from large tanks
in their vehicles.
