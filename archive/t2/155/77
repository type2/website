Hi Theodore,

I have some whistling/leakage problems as well, and was about to replace my 
driver's side vent window seal.  However, when I took a close look at it, 
there were marks on the front edge as though it had been hit with something 
and pushed back a bit.

I rolled down the door window and opened the vent window, and pushed (gently 
but firmly) forward on the bar between the two.  I checked the vent window, 
pushed again, checked, pushed, and finally got the vent window to seal well. 
  When I rolled up the door window, it didn't bind as much as it had before, 
and the whistling from that area was gone!

Before you replace the seal, you might try this procedure, and may end up 
with a few more years of life from the seal.  BE CAREFUL!  The metal is 20+ 
years old and may be brittle -- don't blame me if you break anything.

As always, YMMV.  Good luck!
