Subject: Check out the photo, bus sighting

Since it's Friday, check out the picture of this bus on this band's website here's the link

(OK, I confess, it's MY band but I am just so excited about getting a picture of the 71 onto our "official" web site, that I just had to share it with about a thousand other bus owners!)
FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIDAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY!!
Peace, Johnny B
