Actually water cools better because of the higher thermal transfer
coefficient and heat capacity.  There are the same # molecules at a given
temp and pressure for all ideal-like gasses.  Water is superior to nitrogen
because of is lower molecular weight (18 grams/mol vs 28 grams/mol) and the
additional internal energy degrees of freedom since it is trimolecular (H20)
vs bimolecular (N2).  The O-H vibrational modes are especially good at
energy transfer due to the very low mass of hydrogen.  Helium is also a very
good thermal transfer gas even though it has essentially no internal degrees
of freedom.
