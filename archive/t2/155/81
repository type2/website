Theodore(and listees),

The rubber hardens and shrinks with age.  It does hold up INCREDIBLY 
well(thanks to those crafy Germans), but if you put new rubber in the 
vent-wing, you will notice the difference immediately.  The sun and smog do 
terrible things to rubber.  The post between the wing and the rollup window 
is held near the bottom by a screw, that fits through an elongated eyelet.  
This eyelet rusts(frequently, if not always) and DOES become brittle, so be 
careful when manipulating the post into a better fitting position.
