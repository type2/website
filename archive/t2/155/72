Subject: 1979-specific Heat Control Boxes?

Hi Folks,

I had a question about the heat control boxes (the boxes with the flaps that 
the heater cables attach to).  Specifically, are the boxes for 1979 
different from other years or other series?

I was looking at another mostly-stock '79, and it had little metal ducts 
running parallel to the heater boxes that supposedly dump waste heat out 
into the slipstream.  My flapper boxes appear to be the T1/Beetle style 
where the waste heat just dumps out into the transmission space in front of 
the engine and under the gas tank.  Also, my control arms and cables have a 
little interference with other stuff in that area.

Does anybody have part numbers and/or sources for these?  I imagine my 
engine will run a little cooler if it doesn't have lots of waste heat 
blowing onto the tin up front.

Thanks for any advice or suggestions.
