You should encourage your mechanic to join the type2 list.  He can be our new
Guru, since he knows far more about VW engines, than the engineers who designed
them.  I'm sure there's lots of other unnecessary parts they stuck in 
there, for
no reason at all.  Those Germans love overcomplication.  We can simplify 
our repair
and maintenance by jettisoning these pointless gizmos.  We just need a wise
someone to identify them for us.

Don't you think it's high time you took over the duties of the "mechanic in 
charge"?
