Subject: High Country Bus Festival 6

The 6th Annual High Country Bus Festival
July 26, 27 and 28 - 2002
near Boone, NC

There will be some added activities this year,  check the webpage for full 
details and schedules;  but here are some of the highlights:

- The VW Family Feud:  join host Blistered Dawson for family fun as VW Bus 
nuts square off against one another.  Look for the question Survey to be 
posted to the list soon

- Tech Class:  Watch and learn from a Master Bus Guru!

- Trading Buses:  2 bus owners trade buses for 6 hours and each one re-does 
something to the other's bus.  Will they get new curtains? A new jump seat?  
A working spedo?  who know's!  If you would like to submit yourself and your 
bus as possible contestants, please email Cliff Styles:  
cliff.styles(-at-)cmcsg.com

- As always there will be an award ceremony on Saturday night.  Afterwards 
we will be entertained by THE LOST RIDGE BOYS,  a local bluegrass band.  We 
will also have a Karaoke machine out on Friday night,  so bring your 
earplugs :-)
---------------------------------------------------------------

I will be adding a carabus list to the webpage.  If you would like to start 
and lead a carabus from your area to HCBF 6, please email me:  
buddahvw(-at-)hotmail.com

The Full Moon Bus Club will be feeding the masses once again for Saturday's 
Breakfast with their world famous breakfast burritos.  PLEASE BRING YOUR OWN 
DISH/UTENSIL AND CUP.  This will avoid us having to use a lot of paper 
products and generate waste - and will cut down on the dish washing for the 
group.  If you would like to donate some food/juice/ect  please email 
Snoopy:  vwsnoopy(-at-)knology.net

If you would like to donate some door prizes, please email me, or just bring 
them to the event.

As usual, the T-Shirt orders will be handled on an advanced basis this year. 
  I will not have extra shirts available at the event, so if you want one, 
be sure to get your order in by the deadline:  here is a link to the order 
form:

You do not need to make reservations if your planning to camp in the big 
field with all the buses.  We have the entire field reserved for us.  There 
are no hook-up's in this area though.  If you want a site with hook-ups, you 
will need to contact the campgroud on your own to reserve a site.  but be 
aware, you may end up with your campsite, a long way away from the group of 
buses.  contact email, link and phone number for the campground are on the 
webpage.

As always, check the webpage for all the details,  or just email with some 
questions.  I have a flyer in PDF format,  if you would like to email you a 
copy, please let me know.
