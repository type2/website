Hi,

I was on the list about 4 years ago when I bought my Westfalia, but unsubbed
some time back.  Now, I need help, and I see from your website that I should
try you first for 'help' questions.... so, if you can help me by pointing me
in the right direction, I'd be most grateful!

The bus is a 79 Westy.

I need the following tranny parts, or any information about availability.
My mechanic tells me that several of these are no longer made by VW.

Selector Link Bracket

Selector Link Shaft

Selector Link Ball Joint

Gear Carrier Gasket

Front Nose Gasket

Thanks very much for any leads....
