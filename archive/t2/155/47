Broken glass + hot engine = gasoline everywhere = fire.

Spring for the plastic throw-away variety. You can buy a whole lot of them 
for the price of one burnt bus.

You might use it for decades with no trouble but why take the chance?

Check the industrial supplier catalogs and I'm sure you can find a better 
cleanable filter.

Have you checked the hot rod mags?
