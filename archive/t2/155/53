Not that there's anything wrong with replacing push rod tubes (they're cheap enough),
but I don't find it necessary unless I'm going for show points.  The key to long term
leak free installation (even with new ones) is to pull on the ends to stretch them out
a bit.  Then, when you install the heads they'll crush down to a nice tight fit.
