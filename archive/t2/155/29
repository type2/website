Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust questions.

Not sure what you mean. If you are talking about where the boxes bolt to the
head, then your info is wrong. 76 to 78 2.0L have oval exhaust ports just like
72 to 1.7 and 1.8.
79 has square ports like 80-83 Vanagon.
72 1700 heater boxes will bolt on to any 78 factory 2.0L.
