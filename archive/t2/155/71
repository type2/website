	I get a whistling as well around 60. The foam weatherstripping

I think that there is also a pair of rubber bellows that the control rods 
pass through to operate the flaps.  These could have cracked and torn, 
allowing for a 'whistle' of air while the flaps are supposedly closed.  I 
know that my vent-seals whistle while driving.  For awhile I thought I had 
the same problem, but it was the vent-windows.
