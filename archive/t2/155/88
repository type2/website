Just tap into the wiring between the existing relay and existing fuses... 
Then you can use insultaed male and female spade terminals. No wires cut, 
only one spade changed to insulated.
Just find the fuses for the headlights. When you turn the fusepanel over 
you will see that two of the fuses are connected by a "bridge" of copper. 
Electrically they come from the same source.

One will have a white wire and one will have a yellow wire. Just pull that 
wire off and use it to connect to the relay - you may have to create a 
small jumper wire as an extension. Use these wires to toggle the new relays 
and use the output of the new relays to connect to the fuse terminals that 
you took the yellow and white wires off of. This way the headlights are 
still fused in the normal way.

I can provide more detail if you like.

The new H4 headlights would then simply plug into the existing OEM sockets.

Yes, and I did. Works fine.

Yes - more light but I hear that this overheats the bulb and will shorten 
the bulb's lifespan.

Anyone else have an opinion or experience on this method?
