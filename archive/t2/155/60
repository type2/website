Subject: Re: [T2] Couple of air circulation questions


I get a whistling as well around 60. The foam weatherstripping definately
is toast, but what if the vent is open? Weatherstip has no bearing then. I
think mine is whistling from a passenger door seal leak...

Vent system drainage. Spray water in the vents and it drains here.

Sounds like your flaps need adjustment or the foam weatherstripping is
dead.

Take a trip to the hardware store and look at soft foam pipe wrapping.
