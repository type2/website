Subject: distributor 78 ?

Hi!  I am just about ready to take the rebuilt engine 2.0 liter off the 
engine stand and begin to install it in the bus.   Balanced, new 
pistons, cylinders, heads.... I am excited to hear it run  :-))

HOWEVER, I have a little problem.  The little shaft part that has the 
gear on it that is below the distributor is out of the engine.  So how 
do I install it correctly? I looked it up in all three books I have, but 
the only mention I can find is Don't lose the little spring.....  I have 
the spring.  I am sure number one cylinder must be at TDC and then what?

Thanks in advance....

Edan
