Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum source for power brakes

Hey Mark,  Thank you for the very timely tip.  I was at a junk yard today and 
just happened to stumble upon an auto trans bug. The engine was gone, but 
right under the driver side rear fender was the vacuum reservoir.  It seems like 
it is in pretty good shape, but it is missing the tee fitting so I will have 
to hunt one of those down.  When I find one I'll hook it up temporarily and see 
how it does.  Thanks again.
 
Kris
