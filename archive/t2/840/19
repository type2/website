Subject: Good news - Roof rack and Beetle stash

they came from an old estate to a carry out cook to Barry 'da buzz...


I have loaded in my '78 Westy what appears to be a stash of old Beetle 
parts.  I need help on identifying a roof rack, and if this [probable] 
Beetle roof rack would fit any Type 2 buses, like split or bay.

The feet seem to be the width of the rain gutters, but I have a Westy, so no 
joys for me.  Any value on this for, say, a '67 split??  Or a bay station 
wagon??

I also have two front-or-rear fenders in primer, some NOS wide five styled 
hubcaps, about 2-3 pairs used (only one of the used seems to be chrome) , 
Bosch GERMAN NOS 7'something  spark plugs, and a Sapphire 1 radio in prime 
but aged condition..

And other stuff...  I haven't opened the boxes yet

What will that roof rack fit??  Any links to pictures would be appreciated, 
so I could at least know what this roof rack is..
