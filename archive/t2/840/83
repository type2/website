Subject: Re: [T2] My First Oil Change

"I'm doing my first oil change on my '76 camper that has a 1.7l 
with Dual Carbs.... Where should I jack the rear end up at? I 
have a hydraulic floor jack and my drive way is on a hill so I 
have to jack the rear end up to even get my arm under the 
exhaust."

Hi BJ,
Everyone has contributed good answers to your technical 
questions so I want to comment on your practical questions.  
First, (a technical addition) your '76 Camper's original engine 
was a 2.0 liter (1970 cc)with electro/mechanical fuel 
injection.  In it's original form, it produced 67 bhp and 101 
foot pounds of torque. 

Secondly, I suggest you find a flat spot on which to change your 
oil.  I strongly recommend against lifting the bus with the 
floor jack.  There is no place on the bus where you can safely 
lift it using only one jack.  You must not place it under any 
part of the engine or transmission and then support the weight 
of the rear of the bus.  The weight on the rear axel of '76 
Westy is about one ton.  The alloy engine oil sump is not 
designed to support that much weight.  I use the stock jack, 
lift one side at a time and then support it with two heavy-duty 
jack stands positioned under each side of the torsion tube.  I 
always chock the front wheels but nothing you do will make it 
safe on a slopping driveway.  Again, I strongly suggest that you 
do this oil change on a flat spot.  

Enjoy your Camper... I also have a '76 Westy and love it.

Jeff
