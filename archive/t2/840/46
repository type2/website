Subject: wanted: watercooled replacement engine for 1973 bus

looking for diesel,
but a good gas engine would be OK.

I am wanting a watercooled engine that is
readily available in junkyards....

I will buy from a private party or a yard,

if you have suggestions for good engines,
please let me know.

Jen
