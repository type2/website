I saw this on the web a few months ago. I've yet to come across anyone who's bought it...

I've been using the LM-1 for the last 16 months:

So far, it's been great. It was $349 and has helped two vehicles tune up for the strict CA smog tests. Both times, the test results matched the instrument readings.

I welded their SS bung onto my exhaust and ran the cable under the bus and under the seal of the sliding door. I power the unit from the dash using an adapter with the silver socket. There is enough cable to put the unit on the passenger seat.

Running the cable is the most difficult part of the setup. Apart from that remembering to turn it on everytime you fire up the engine is the only complaint I have but that's the nature of these devices.

What I like most, is that I can monitor the AFR while I drive.

You cannot get an accurate reading from the tailpipe. You must mount the sensor before the muffler.
