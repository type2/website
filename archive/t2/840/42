Subject: Re: [T2] Diodes and door buzzer

Darren asked:


 Ok, I've searched and searched and can't find the info I'm looking for.
I'm planning on installing a diode between my headlight switch and my new door buzzer, so that if my
headlights (parking lights actually) are on
when I open the door, the buzzer will go off. Question is, which diode?
I don't know much about electronics like diodes and transistors. The one I
bought from the "Shack" is rated at 50V, 3A. Will this work? All the other ones they had were rated 200V or
greater.

If I understand right, the 50V is the peak inverse voltage. So, if the
voltage at the cathode end is greater than 50V, then electrons will flow
backwards through the diode. Correct?  This shouldnt happen with a 12V
system.

 I only see diodes rated at 1A or 3A. Will the 3A suffice?

A simpler way to do it:  Get a key-in or lights-on buzzer from a Ford car or pickup at a wrecking yard. It is
a simple two terminal buzzer. You apply power and ground and it buzzes.  Most of them are plugged into the
fuse box or near it.

For power, tap into the park light output wire at the headlight switch. For ground, tap into the single wire
going to the door jamb switch.
Open door with headlights off, buzzer only gets ground. No buzz.
Turn lights on with door closed, buzzer only gets power. No buzz.
Turn lights on and open door.....BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.

Real simple, real easy, you don't need to redesign the wheel :)
