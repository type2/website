Subject: air fuel ratio monitor

I know some of you folks are into air fuel metering.. I havn't been paying 
too much attention until I saw an ad for NGK air fuel ratio monitor,,, and 
recently lost an engine to what I believe a drastic change in a/f due to a 
injection component failure,, yet to be determined. 

so.. are there any opinions on 
http://www.ngksparkplugs.com/products/air-fuel/index.asp?nav=19000&country=U

It looks like it runs $300.. and the cable length will be a bit short for a 
bus..
