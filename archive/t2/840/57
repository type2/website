Subject: Re: [T2] wanted: watercooled replacement engine for 1973 Bus

Kennedy has adapter for just about any conversion you want. All water  cooled 
engines from 74-98 are the same bolt up. Excluding V6. I'm sure even some  
newer models. Gas and diesel. Before you get started you need to do some  
reserch. You might even contact Robert in NC he has done the diesel conversions  
with the option of using the veggie oil. Whether it's gas or diesel the cooling  
system will be the same. That is going to be the biggest hassle. Getting the  
engine in and running is simple compared to the cooling system. Research  
locations for the radiator. I had a V6 Ford in a 74 bus with the radiator on the  
front. Very fast and very nice. Drove great and cooled great. A/C, cruise  
control, heat, speed, ect....I'll find Roberts site and send it to  you.
