Subject: Re: [T2] wanted: watercooled replacement engine for 1973 Bus

Hi Todd,

It's not quite  so simple as just ordering in and bolting up some
Brazilian parts.

The brazilian baywindow only looks identical; it uses a splitwindow
front suspension. Because of this I suspect that the nose from a
watercooled brazilian bay would not be a straight bolt-up to a german-
made bay.  And we have no idea what that brazilian bay uses for a
transmission or shift linkage. Could be the same, could be different.
If it's different, then you're back to Kennedy for something home-grown.

Also... We're not talking about surplus inventory or OEM's here; the
only source for the parts you're talking about is through the VW food
chain. Have you priced new parts from a dealer lately? Purchasing
body panels and structural components from a dealership is going to
cost serious coin. Then you have to export them to the U.S. You need
to speak fluent Portuguese if you're planning on going this route.


Finally, Here are the brazilian engine specs as reported at
www.limbobus.org:

Longitudinal, 4 Cylinders, Inline
2 Valves/cylinder
1390 cm3 (1.4L) Displacement
Compression Ratio 11:1
HP at 4800rpm, 78 (gas)
HP at 4800rpm, 80 (alc)
Multi point sequential fuel injection

78 HP is the same output as the 2L aircooled engine. And I'd expect
that the 2L probably has better torque at low rpms.

It IS cheaper to buy something with higher performance that bolts
right in. Call Boston Bob or Jake Raby and build a high-performance
aircooled engine.


Happy trails,

Recently, Volkswagen was forced by the local emissions laws in Brazil
(seriously) to convert the Khombi to watercooled.

All new VW Busses in Brazil are now watercooled. It comes with a 1.4
liter watercooled four.
Here's a picture of it from their site: http://www.vw.com.br/

I'd imagine that... you could probably buy all this stuff off the
internet or from one of those parts suppliers that buys stuff from
mexico, etc.. and install it in your Bus. Those VW Khombi's are
identical to our busses with the exception of some minor things
like.. higher roof line, slightly revised body molding, different
weatherstripping, etc.

The suspensions and everything are the same.

You'll notice in the pictures that they now have a large radiator in
the front... but I suspect that you could probably install a radiator
underneath the car... or maybe a couple of them at an angle with full
time radiator fans.

I'd suspect that the water cooled 1.4 is probably quicker too.
