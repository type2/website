Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum source for power brakes

    Just another .02 worth. Had a friend with a fairly aggressive cam grind
and the available vacuum was a little slow coming with all the valve
overlap. When he had to sit at a red light, the brake peddle would get hard
and lose assist.
    We installed a "Vacuum reservoir canister" in line (ala 1950s style
domestic cars) and cured the problem.
    Just a thought.
