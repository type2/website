Reading the report, I noticed that the highest
increase in temperature occured in the water where the
warmer was installed. I wonder if this device works
better on our oil cooled vehicles seeing as the higest
temperature increase would occur in the oil which
cools and lubercates the engine. What do y'all think?
Too bad the study was not performed on an oil cooled
vehicle.
