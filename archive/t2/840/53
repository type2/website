Subject: Throttle cable

Working on a bus that currently has a auto trans with a Weber progressive.  
The throttle linkage has been broken, but I'm going to weld a new 6mm stud 
on the end tomorrow.  I have a right side linkage that pulls from the top 
with a hole for the rod w/ c-clip and spring? to go thru.  Any pitfalls with 
auto and carb I need to be aware of?
