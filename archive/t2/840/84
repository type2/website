Subject: Re: [T2] My First Oil Change

Hey BJ      There is one other thing about doing an oil change on these 
motors.. Unlike the bug motors where you dont have an oil filter(unless it is an 
add on) you normally remove the screen and clean it. On the type4 motor you 
really shouldn't mess with this screen. If you do be real careful in tightening 
the bolt as you can break the inside of the case that holds the oil pick-up 
tube,  later  Mark Dearing
