Hello All,
-- Just because this has recently come up on the list... I thought I'd let
everyone know that my company is now producing bed slats for all years of
dropgates. We are producing high quality slats in oak(stock), cherry, and
maple. Other woods and custom lengths are available on request. Please e-mail
me for a price list and shipping quote. Hope we can help some of you with your
projects.

Thanks,

Chris
