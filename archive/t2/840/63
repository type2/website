Ok, forget the diode. I'm making a simple solution hard or
as Karl says, reinventing the wheel.

I decided to use two different audibles. One for key in, door open and
another for lights on, door open. I bought a RS buzzer for $2.99, put 2
spade connectors on the wires and plugged them into where the original
buzzer plugged into the bottom of the fuse box. I also bought a $10 12V
RadioShack chime and connected the ground to the same ground at the buzzer
and connected the positive to a wire that is hot when the parking lights
are on. Works like a champ and only cost me less than $15.

Now, if I open the door with the engine running and the lights on, both
alarms go off, but at least I know what each sound is for. Hopefully, I
wont drain my battery because I left my parking lights on....again.
