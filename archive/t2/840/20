   I bought a roof rack at a yard sale just for the feet that attach to a
rain
gutter (hard to find now that most cars don't have rain gutters anymore).
I made up an extension out of oak to raise the cross pieces so the rack
would clear the "hump" in my Bay's roof...Plenty o' sheetrock carried on
the rack since then... ;-)
