Subject: my new bus...

 Hi All.... I figured out the site was bouncing my emails because the were
too large.. the story of my life...
I'm getting my bus, hopefully today. I'm waiting on my settlement check,
which hopefully will be in the mail today.
It's a '66 DP, camperstyle. Go to www.thesamba.com. The ad was posted
1/14/06. It's in Jerome Idaho.
It looks like it's in pretty good shape. He has a little rust, but that's to
be expected. I'm just glad it has all of the original camper gear.. even the
sink and the original radio... whooohoooo. He said it runs great. I hope so,
because I'll have to drive it back to Boise today, which is about a 2 hour
drive... doing 75-80...
I'll let you know when I get it, I'll have a kazillion questions. Also, does
anyone know where I can find the tent for the type 2 '66 ?? It has the hook
but no tent. I'd love to get one if I can.
Also, is there a way to post a picture of "Ripple", my new bus?
Thanks...
Karen
