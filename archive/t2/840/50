Subject: Re: [T2] My First Oil Change

<<I'm doing my first oil change on my '76 camper that has a 1.7l with
Dual Carbs. 
I've got a couple noob questions, I'm using SAE 30 oil, I've always used
that in my Bugs.>>

BJ,

Depend's where your crib and the bus is----

Northern Minnesota?
Nope.

St. Louis?

Ok for now, but I would think about kicking it up a notch to 40 or 50
weight in the summer.

10-40--15-50 Castrol GTX Is good. 


<<Where should I jack the rear end up at? I have a hydraulic floor jack
and my drive way is on a hill so I have to jack the rear end up to even
get my arm under the exhaust.>>


Grab it under the trailing arm or the frame inside the jacking point.
It'll get up high enough to change the oil.  

<<2nd question is oil filter. My LAPS sold me a Bosch 3402>>

Who's the LAPPER?

<< I've read something about you have to use some special german one, is
the Bosch going to work?>>

Any filter will work.
Just not a top shelf selection that Bosch you got.
The preferred set up is an Mann or Mehle Deutschland VW filter's.
