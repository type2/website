Hey All,

I have something pretty interesting that is now a no langer available
item from it's manufacture.

I have located and obtained all of the last of the VW KAT's engine
heater's for any air cooled Bus, Bug or Vanagon.

They are now an obsolete item at 5 Star Manufacturing out of Clarksville
Mississippi, and as of last Tuesday are no longer available.

If you might be interested in having your air cooled Bus or Van all
warmed up and ready to start on the frigid tundra mornings-- have a
rreal short warm up for quick heat to the cab, or just having one for
grins, just to be able to say you have one--drop me a line.

They are all brand new in the box, with installation instructions.

The supply is very limited, and now a very rare item.

Take Care,

            ______________
