Subject: Alternator cooling boot

	Replacing the cooling boot on the 78 while I have the alternator
out.  The new one I have fits fine on the alternator side but the fit on the
fan shroud is nothing short of bogus.  I thought I remembered seeing a
comparison on these boot's from different manufacturer's (ratwell?) but
can't find it now.  I'm hoping to find one that fits better than what I got.

Thanks,
