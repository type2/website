Subject: Chinese "BRUCK Germany" SVDA Distributor

Just tossing a question out there to any who have used this distributor
available at CIP1

http://www2.cip1.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D043%2D905%2D205

How's the quality and/or reliability of conatruction?  Anyone use one of
these for a period of time to give an appreciable evaluation compared to the
Brazilian/Mexican Made Bosch SVDA (043 905 205ZB) variety?  I'd like to
gather some comments out there to give people a small opinionated
write-up who visit my Bosch Ignition & Distributor page on my site and an
idea of it's worth.  No names would be used to keep it anonymous.

I've been personally using the Mexican variety with great results so far on
a 68 Bug and 73 Ghia.

TIA
