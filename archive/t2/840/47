Subject: Re: [T2] wanted: watercooled replacement engine for 1973 bus

Hi Jen,

If you are considering an engine conversion for a 73 bus I would  
recommend you consider the following:

1. NOTHING is a straight bolt-up to a bus transmission except an  
aircooled bus engine.

2. Contact Kennedy Engineering to find out what adapters are  
available to match your transmission. This will determine what  
engines are eligible for use in your conversion.  http:// 
www.kennedyeng.com/

3. An engine conversion is not a simple procedure. Converting a  
baywindow bus to a watercooled engine requires about 100 hours or  
more of skilled labour.  You will need to fabricate motor mounts,  
cooling system, electrical engine management, air intake and  
filtration, and exhaust. It's been done before, but it ain't easy or  
cheap.

The same amount of time, effort and expense taken for a conversion  
could perform miracles with a stock bus engine, and get your bus on  
the road MUCH sooner. In addition, consider the fact that the  
baywindow bus was designed for use with a 75HP engine. Installing a  
high-performance engine will lead to additional wear and tear on the  
clutch, transmission, suspension, brakes, steering and tires as they  
will be subjected to stresses they were not originally designed for.  
Don't even consider this upgrade unless you have proper-spec'd tires  
on the bus.


On the other hand... Nothing's impossible. I've ridden in the  
legendary Roadcow, and it's a rocket compared to any other aircooled  
bus I've ever driven. It has a watercooled toyota engine in it. The  
owner puts another transmission in it pretty much every year or so.


Happy trails,
