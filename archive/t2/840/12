Not to throw cold water on anyone's enterprise but isn't this as simple as  
findign the original dimensions and getting some time on a table saw, a  
palm sander and maybe a router (for the edges)???

Just curious b/c any carpenter worth 10 cents ought to make you slats out  
of your favorite wood with your favorite stain/sealer.

We built a bed floor for my '49 Chevy truck and it was quite easy.
