Hi Mark,

Surprisingly, no-one has brought this up before.

As far as I know, there isn't a enough open water at Valens for  
swimming. Most of the holes in the ice are about 6" to 12" in  
diameter. Perfect for ice fishing, but very dangerous for swimming.

Last year I bagged my limit while Ice Fishing... But my wife near  
drowned trying to cook it. (Ba-dum-Bump).


Happy trails,
