Subject: Undoing My Pop-top Camper

We've had our '73 Camper for over 10 years now and we love it (at least I  
do...my husband thinks I should sell it), but the pop-top has been a mess since  
the beginning.  The Camper was purchased from a hard-up relative and  pretty 
much a basket case that we wouldn't have touched save to help them out.  I'm 
thinking of getting rid of all the top and covering the hole. Has anyone  else 
out there done this and, if so, what method did you use? We're just  finishing 
up an engine rebuild and we might do this at the same time. I looked  thru 
the archives, but couldn't find anything on this. Thanks in  advance...Glenna
