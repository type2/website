Subject: Brakes or Wheel Bearing

Hey List,

I was driving last weekend and started to smell a burn smell from the rear of
the bus ( I was going down wind at the time) .Pulled over and  It turns out
that my left rear rim/wheel  was very hot to the touch not like the right rear
which was at current air temp.

 I pulled my left rear tire off this weekend as I though the wheel cylinder
had maybe locked up. Pulled off the wheel and everything looks fine.

My question should there be any in/out play in the wheel ? I hafve about a
1/64 of play. I'm thinking that the wheel bearing got hot for some reason.The
wheel turns fairly free , not real smooth.

Thanks,

Trey
