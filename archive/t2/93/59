There was on the earliest bay westies but IIRC it was dropped before the end of the "Campmobile 70" interior.  Change may have coincided with the introduction 
of the steel (previously plastic) sinktop.  Later mods are held up by the hinges, and I agree with the listee who said your hinges are bent.  

John Baker, if you have a true Westfalia campmobile 70 interior on your '71, you're missing your sink lid/counter.

>PS Isn't there a link to a westy manual online somewhere?

That's what I thought, but I don't see the parts catalog online for the C70 model (BTW, that's not a "1970 Campmobile" but an interior arrangement called 
"Campmobile 70".)

>Westfalia made all the Campmobiles. Some had an optional pop-top, among other things.

Yes, the Westfalia label seems to confuse the heck out of newbies.  Westfaliawerke ("Westfalia Works") made camper conversions referred to as Campmobiles 
in the U.S.  In other words --   Westfalia:Campmobile::Coleman:Lantern.

>Aren't all "westies" pop tops? And the non-pop tops are VW campmobiles/weekenders? Or did Westfalia actually make non poppers?

As mentioned, Westfaliawerke's Campmobiles could be ordered with or without an "elevating roof" as it is called in the parts manual.  There were various configs 
of the interior, too (we're talking pre-74), including the "Campmobile 80" which had (I think) a fullwidth back seat, no suicide cabinet, and a much deeper 
headbanger cabinet since it was not a poptop (and thus didn't have the sunroof pocket, which cuts into ceiling space).

>an option for the Campmobile, but refers to all of
>them as Campmobiles, not Westfalias.

This would be like your Ford Falcon's owner's manual continually referring to "Fords" when it meant "Falcons".  Westfalia company didn't call their product 
"westfalias" (or "westfalien" ;-).

>Also, the manufacturer's tag on my bus states that it
>was made by the Westfaliawerke. Go figure.

That would make sense when you consider the language spoken by the manufacturers.

>A Westy is a Campmobile, simple as that.
>Westfalia is the company that did the conversion and they were sold at VW
>dealers under the marketing term Campmobile.

Outside the U.S., or beyond the early 70's, there were different labels for some of Westfalia's VW-based camper conversions, I believe.

So many of the kiddies say "I got a Westy" when they have a Riviera, or an Adventurewagon, or even just a bus with a bed in the back....  And let me rant for a 
bit about all those campers "with a tent" that really only have canvas walls on the poptop.

>Now we got Westy's, we got Riviera's, we got plain? buses, we got non-pop
>top Westy's, we got somethat pop all over and some that pop in the middle,
>we got some that tilt in the front, we got some that tilt in the back?

Yep.

>Can someone please reference something that explains all ofthe differences
>to me?....so when someone says that they have a xxxx, I know what they are
>talking about?
