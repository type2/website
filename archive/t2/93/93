Very well said. One thing to keep in mind when buying any vehicle is that 
fixing up a junker will almost always run you more in time and money than 
the initially higher cost of a ship-shape vehicle. Either way, an old bus is 
going to be a major investment in time and money, whether immediately or 
down the road.

I learned all this the hard way, shelling out a measly $600 for an old 
motorcycle I thought I could fix. I ended up losing close to a thousand 
dollars on that venture. I fixed it up quite a bit, but never got it street 
legal. For the same price I could have bought a newer bike in registerable 
shape. The same thing is going to apply to a bus. Any car in good shape 
seems to be worth less than the sum of its parts on the market.
