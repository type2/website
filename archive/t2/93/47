Subject: RE: [T2] '71 westy interior question

I am not sure about a '71, but on my '73 the counter is entirely held up by
the hinges. If yours is not horizontal, then the hinges are probably bent.
This counter would be nice if it had a support. I do not think they came
with one, although I do have a bracket near the bottom of the icebox that
could be used for some kind of prop? Anyway, the lack of support makes it
almost useless.
