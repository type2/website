Subject: '71 westy interior question

Hi Everyone,
    I have a question regarding the camping interior in our '71.  When I
open the countertop on the sink, it goes past  horizontal by 15 or 20
degrees.  Is there suposed to be some kind of support on the aisle side of
the sink/icebox cabinet to support the opened countertop?  My cabinet does
have some small holes drilled on that side of it, as if there were screws.
Right now the metal hinges rest against the side of the cabinet when the top
is open, is that right?
