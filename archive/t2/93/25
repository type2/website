How about a leaky intake manifold on just that cylinder?  It seems to me
that it would compress fine but make that kind of noise, but only on
intake.  By every crank, do you mean that you're hearing it on every
stroke (all four) or possibly just
intake?

Just typing what falls out of this ragged head of mine.
