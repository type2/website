Subject: RE: [T2] More FI questions/woes

When i did live in CA, i just bought one (which was full of sand), shook it 
out and mounted it where it was supposed to be. the guy never tested to see 
if it worked, just told me that it had to BE THERE. So, for whatever it is 
worth, i would say make a junkyard trip, since new they are not cheap parts!
