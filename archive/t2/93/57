Subject: countertop support

I have a 1971 Riviera. I don't have a built in sink. I have a bolted down
countertop. It looks original. On the left side of that counter is a small
adjustable rod that looks like it's supposed to support the flip over
countertop. Strange, you have a flip over countertop and no support and I
have a support with nothing to hook it to.


>I have a question regarding the camping interior in our '71.  When I
>open the countertop on the sink, it goes past  horizontal by 15 or 20
