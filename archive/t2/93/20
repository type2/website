Greetings All,

In the past I have seen the merits of POR-15 discussed in this and other 
forums.  But I wanted to share with you a recent experience I had with 
another Restomotive product, POR Putty (not to be confused with POR Patch).
I had the usual decay of the battery shelf in the engine compartment.  The PO 
had simply tossed in a replacement shelf and set the battery on that.  I 
wanted to get it fixed correctly so I had a welder (haven't learned how yet) 
clean out the cancer and weld in the replacement shelf.  He lap welded the 
piece in and advised me to seal the weld with "body putty".
I recalled seeing a listing for POR Putty over at aircooled.net. so I ordered 
that.  This stuff is fantastic.  It's an expoxy putty.  Mix equal amounts 
(you get two sticks of this stuff) till it's the consistency of modeling 
clay.  Apply it to the surface to be filled.  Wet your fingers and you can 
smooth this putty down so there is no sanding whatsoever.  Sets up hard in a 
couple of hours.
I did mine and it's hard to tell where the weld was after a coat of paint.  
And does that shelf sound solid when I rap on it.  
I know, I know.............this sounds like a paid testimonial.  It's not.  
Just wanted to share what seems to me to be a great product to use repair and 
restoration.
