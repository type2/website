Subject: Hardtop camper question


Hi, I've been reading the posts on '71 westy interiors.  I have a '69
hardtop camper that has a stained (darkish) birch wood headliner.  Just
wondering if all hardtop campers have this, or if this a 'rare' option?  I
live in minnesota where there aren't many buses, and haven't seen any
hardtop campers.

thanks in advance,
Keri
