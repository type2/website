Hello all,
 I need some peices for my 75 westy interior.

veneer.
two:  the folding top with good veneer for the Icebox Cabnet.
three:  the removeable Table in the drivers cabin with good veneer.
four:  The storage box/trash container, i will take that in just about any
shape.

If anyone can help me with these or know someone who can please let me know.
