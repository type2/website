Hi Folks,

Just to clarify the VIN that Sean mentioned.  If the number is a 9-digit 
number (236-xxx-xxx), then the 3rd number is the last number of the year -- 
Nineteen-sixty-six in this case.  If the VIN is a 10-digit number 
(2362-xxx-xxx), the 3rd number is also the last number of the year, but the 
4th number indicates it's the 2nd decade of this numbering system -- 
Nineteen-SEVENTY-six in this case.

Also, the 3 in the second place indicates a Kombi, which was the base 
"incomplete vehicle" that Westfalia-werke used for their conversions.

Just a few things I've noticed...

Jason Upper
Aspen, Colorado
1979 Westy "Sweet Pea"  <-- 2392 056 372, Campmobile with poptop
