Rob and all,

Check here for the engine filler panel:

http://www.creativecarcraft.com/notforbug.htm

I bought this last year while fixing all the screw ups from my 73
panel's DPO.  

Very high quality hand laid fiberglass job.  With shipping (to SOCAL) it
was about $185.00.  It came very quick.

Satisfied customer!
