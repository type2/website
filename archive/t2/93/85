Subject: Transmission Seal

Volks,
        I need to replace my rear Tranny seal, the one around the input
shaft that goes into the motor.  (I was told it went bad apparently
because I towed the bus from Del. w/o an engine & the shaft spun most or
all the way)(Hoping I did not ruin anything else)
        My question is two fold: 
1. is there an explode view of the tranny online? (I don't yet have a
Bentley book, $35, must order)
2. When I removed the seal, along with the seal came another part. It
appears to be some sort of race. I was told that it is not supposed to
come out. I don't know what it is called or if it can be replaced. It is
about 1" long and has a flange along the top with notches in it. the
inside also has grooves.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in Advance,
Jim
