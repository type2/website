Subject: vw archives / Veneer

After going through the type2 VW archives, i found some discussion on veneer 
replacement, but the only leads for places to buy new veneer that matches 
the westy interior (77 bus) were cabinet makers. has anyone out there struck 
gold on finding the "perfect match" for old westy interiors? i broke a piece 
of my table veneer off this weekend, and i have glued it back together so 
many times that i am ready to start over. the moisture in the pacific 
northwest is hell on the veneer, so my interior is losing its appeal... i'd 
like to stay stock-looking. thanks
-jeremy
