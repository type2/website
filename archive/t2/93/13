Jeremy,

Alas, as far as I can tell "dark knotty pine" is on the "out" list world
wide :-(  I searched all the manufacturers I could find a couple years ago
and had no luck even coming close.  The very closest I could come was a
medium teak, which had no knots and was way too green in tint.  At the
same time, even tho it is "out" in the U.S, I have always wondered if dark
knotty pine may not be the "in" style in some other country... Germny,
Britain, Australia, etc. etc.  If anyone finds this elusive stuff in any
sort of plastic laminate (formica), please, please post!!!
