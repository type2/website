Subject: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question

Billy et al

This question has caused me a great deal of
headscratching - the owner's guide lists the poptop as
an option for the Campmobile, but refers to all of
them as Campmobiles, not Westfalias. See this
link:http://www.thesamba.com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals70westy.htm

Also, the manufacturer's tag on my bus states that it
was made by the Westfaliawerke. Go figure. In any
case, the table is pictured and referred to in the
above manual for a 70 (I imagine a 71 would be the
same).
Hope I can get the lid back on this can-o-worms,

Tom
