  it may just be running rich.  I am guessing the inside of the pipe is =
black.   Is it FI or carb?

  My buddy is having some raw fuel come out of his exhuast pipe. He =
hasn't seen it, but can smell it a lot.=20

  I imagine its not firing on 1 or more of the cylinders. What do we do =
to test it, besides checking the spark plug for a spark? Could there be =
a leak or something?

  Thanks,
