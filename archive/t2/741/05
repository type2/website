Subject: Re: [T2] Westy tent?

I was at Bugapalooza here in Chattanooga and saw a
nice awning on a 70's model Westy.  Turns out, it was
the $35 one available at Walmart right now.  It comes
in a nice case and is very easy to set up.  What the
guy had done was took off the rear poles, bought a PVC
T-adaptor that fit the tubes, laid it snugly in the
gutter,  and secured the Tarp to the gutter with tarp
clips.  It worked great and was easy to do.  Plus, he
can still slap the rear poles in and use it
stand-alone.  I'm going to do that myself.

As far as the Westy tent, I was wanting the original
just for nostalgic reasons but when I saw several of
them I realized that a) they're old technology and a
real pain to set up, b) very heavy and too bulky to
store in a bus and c)they're UGLY!  Plus, they don't
aesthetically match up with my bus (another Sage
green) or any other color bus.  They could have
offered similar colors at the very least.  There are
many better tents with floors that are easier to set
up and take up less space.  If I did a whole lot of
camping I'd spring for one.  For now, a tarp will
suffice.  

Conclusion:  I would only buy the original tent if I
had a totally original bus that I wanted to sell to a
collector who would garage the whole package and not
ever be seen at a campsite.  Or if I lose my house and
have to live in the bus in one place for an extended
period of time in bad weather.  (I'm not ruling that
out!)  Then you want the heaviest thing you can find. 


Cheers...KR
