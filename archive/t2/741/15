Eric,

3m makes some stuff that glues body panels back on to late model 
cars...ask your body shop or hi class flaps about this.

Make sure it's where you want it when you glue it!  My buddy in the 
aircraft business says the stuff they use for planes takes 7 days to set 
up totally, but will ***never*** come off.

Cheers, dave
