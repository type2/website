They are available but expensive.

I think the valves will continue to stretch as long as they are subjected to excess heat. They started stretching when the clearance was perfect.

If the valve cools mainly through contact with the seat I'm postulating that the solid lifter will burn a valve much faster than a hydraulic valve.

Once the valve starts to stretch what are the options? At what point do you recommend the heads be removed to prevent catastrophic failure.

The secret of my success I would guess.
