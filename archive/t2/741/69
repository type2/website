Thanks for that information. I always heard you should record the
results of valve adjustments, but I didn't know what I was supposed to
be looking for!

 That depends upon how often you check them.  If you check them every 2000
 miles and they're closing to .003 every time they will keep stretching

 recording the valve clearances every time I check them.  Closing to zero
 in 2000 miles is definitely a failure mode!
