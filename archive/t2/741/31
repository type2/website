Does this advice include Sodium exhaust valves?

When a valve driven by a solid lifter stretches, it goes tight and the valve fails to seat which causes it to burn even faster. When the valve is driven by a hydraulic lifter, the lifter pumps up just enough to hydrolock before it pushes the valve off the seat. On the way back to the seat, the valve makes seat contact and the process repeats as the lifter self adjusts as the engine runs.

Which ones will you notice first? Solid. But which valve is actually going to burn faster?
