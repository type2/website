examples of the butterfly effect to tell? I'm particularly interested in 
the new parts/bits that were fitted, and seemed to kill your bus until 
you realised what had happened.>

My first VW tuneup took 2 weeks! Adjusted the valves about 6 times to get them right. Carb adjustment took days, points REALLY screwed me up the first 5 times I did them, etc. 

However after graduating from the school of stupid amateur tricks I can tuneup a VW JUST so everytime. 

My Beetles idled like a Singer Sewing machine... 

And in case you are wondering I still do things like this - fix 1 small item and screw up 5 others.
