Changing your muffler is not difficult.  Consider
buying self-locking brass exhaust nuts.  Use new
triangular gaskets.  Don't over tighten the nuts, as
you can bend the 3-way flanges and create an exhaust
leak at that junction for-ever-more.  
    
Now the muffler I used is an "eliminator" style for my
'78.  I have no cross-over pipe.  The Muffler design
eliminates the need for the cross-over.  I'm still
kicking myself in the a** for converting to this lower
quality muffler.  It sounds studly, but they rust-out
with only 3 or 4 years of part-time use.  I endorse
you using the Bus-Boys.  You will likely get better
quality than I have.  Also seek out Germansupply.com
and Bus Depot.
    
You saw the 2 bolts below on the exhaust attachment
flange.  Yes, there is a bolt at the top.  3 equally
spaced bolts.  Sometimes, the upper bolt is difficult
to get to.
     
The links below are for California Import Parts.  I am
not endorsing their parts or prices.  I just buy the
majority of my VW parts from them.  I include the
hyperlinks below for the purpose of visual
communication with you.

The Muffler I use (hyperlink above) is NOT
RECOMMENDED.  They do not last very long.  They easily
rust.
