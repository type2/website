I've never changed it before.  I'm sure the mechanic
put the Cat.Converter back in when I had the new
engine put in. That was the last time the muffler was
changed.  I can see two bolts on the bottom of the
right side. So I figure there is one on top. Again, I
have never changed a muffler on my Rudy bus.  I'm just
trying to get a heads-up to get it fixed right. I'm
ordering from the BusBoys, by the way. They are fast
with UPS to Seattle, 3 days usually.

I'm not much more than a tune-up mechanic.  I usually
save the big stiff for Dan, the man in Seattle.   So,
if it is anything other than tune up parts I'm very
green.  If it's easy then that usually means I'll get
frustrated and find it difficult but not impossible
LOL!  I don't have a garage, just a driveway!  Part of
the reason I can't do major repairs...

Thanks,

Rae
