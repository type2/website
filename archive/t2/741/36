The floating piston in a hyd lifter is ideally kept in its mid range of 
travel, which I think I measured once as being around 2 mm?  A 
stretching valve would be like adding too many turns to the initial 
adjustment, to the point where it is like a "solid" and may not let the 
valve seat.  I sugg. adusting the hyd every 20,000 mi or so, which will 
give some idea if a lifter requires unusual loosening.
  As to replacing exhausts every 30,000 mi for FI or 50K carb.- mine are 
still running at 245,000 mi!
