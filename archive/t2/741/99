Subject: valves = gas leak

I finished adjusting valves on my 74 bus and I think
they are good.  I double checked them.  I put
everything back together so I could check the dwell. 
When I started the bus it seemed fine then i noticed a
very very fast gas leak coming from around the
mechanical fuel pump.  IS there any correlation
between the valves and the fuel pump?  Kinda wierd
that it didn't leak before and now it is leaking
horribly?

P.S. I am from Mishawaka, In originally.  I just
finished up my senior year in electrical engineering
at Purdue University.  My bus is blue and white wihth
a sportsmobile top.
