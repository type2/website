From: "jason antolovich":

I am new to the list and I have a question...  I am
working on my old 1974 bus that has been camped out in
my garage for about a year and a half.  It is running
but not very well.  I decided to go through the tune
up procudure that is in the "how to keep your
volkswagen alive book."  I have a question about the
valve adjustment.

 I can find the point of TDC for cylinder #1 witht
the little notch on the pully and alligning it to the
0 degree mark on the scale. The manual says to use
this position to find the clearance of .006" on
cyliner 1 and 3 for both the intake and exhaust
valves.  Then to rotate the pulley 180 degrees from
the notch to do cylinders 2 and 4.  I am having
difficulty knowing weather or not i am exactly 180
from the original mark on the pulley. I don't want to
set .006 at 175 degrees or something.  Any suggestions
on the valve setting?

That way will give you a back ache..... up and down up and down.
And will totally confuse you...... more than you are just typing it!

Easiest way to adjust valves on ANY 4 cycle engine:

Get a remote starter button. Remove valve cover. Pick any cylinder you want to adjust 1st.
Watch the pair of rockers as you turn the engine in the direction of rotation.

When the exhaust JUST starts to open, STOP, and adjust that cylinders intake valve.

Rotate the engine. The exhaust will open, close, the intake will open, close.

When the intake JUST closes, STOP, and adjust that cylinders exhaust valve.

Forget where the dist rotor is pointing, it maybe 180 out!

To check dist timing afterwards:
Watch #3 valves. At the point of rocking, this is when the exhaust and intake are moving at the same time, the
exhaust is just closing and the intake is just opening, STOP. Look at your timing mark. It should be on zero.
Look at your dist rotor. It will be at #1 to fire.

The book method relies on you having the dist in the correct position..... kinda sucks later after
getting up and going down more than 4 times to find the engine won't run when you get done!
This way, the valves you adjust are guaranteed to be on the heel of the cam.
