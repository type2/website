Subject: Re: [T2] Westy tent?

I've been finding these little tent trailers are really catching on 
in the midwest.  They weigh less than 250 pounds and when folded out 
will sleep 4 to 6 people very comfortable.  You can't tell you're 
pulling it and you don't have to store it in the bus.  When you set 
up for camping, you still have the bus to drive around in without 
disturbing your campsite.  Not to mention you can use it to carry 
some of the camping gear too.

This one has new tires, lights, complete new wiring, no holes in tent 
or screens, wood is solid.  $650, located close to Kansas City.
