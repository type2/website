Hm.  I'd think that ignoring a partially collapsed brake flex hose would
be most dangerous...  You're already pulling to one side, right?  Now,
what happens if that sucker collapses completely and you have to panic
stop.  You're going to be pulled way to one side, neh?

I recall severe pull when I had one collapse on the front.  Got it fixed
right now.

It's a quick fix.  The most time consuming part is bleeding your brakes
after.
