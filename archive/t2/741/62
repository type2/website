Subject: oil pressure sender fitting

Guys & gals,

I'm gonna put an oil pressure gauge in my '74 Westy,
type 4 motor. I'm looking at the Air Cooled Parts
adapter fitting to buy, but it gives two different
measurements, one in metric and one in english
dimensions. I'm assuming that the one I want is the
metric but not sure. Help!

Also, how difficult will it be to remove the stock
sender and replace with this unit? How much, if any,
tin has to be removed?
