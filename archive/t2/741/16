Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Tent.

I'd like to find a bag for my tent.  I want one of those boating kinda bags 
that are water proof - the ones that roll closed - I haven't been able to 
find one that is the same dimensions as my tent bag.  I figure - unless you 
can carry the tent on the roof - the space they occupy is a greater 
inconvenience than having the tent.
