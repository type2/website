We are in Red Bluff, California. All good driver and multi-vehicle
discounts. Don't have a homeowner's insurance discount though.

I've had Geico a couple of times in the past, haven't been able to
match our rate. Have also had Amica and USAA before. Good Sam has been
trying to get us, but their quote is $165/year.

We had trouble with Allstate on our homeowners insurance. Will never
deal with them again.
