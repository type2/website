Subject: Have you ever floored your motor?

Yes, I have floored my motor. With a 17 rubber mallet. One punch. A
roundhouse right. Seriously, (well only half so) my Westy gives me a
signal when it's being driven too fast. The fibreglass storage bin on
top makes a nasty rattling vibration between 65 and 70, especially in
a headwind. Time to slow down. Or loosen the bolts a little, I'm told.

There is a T2 question here. There's a nearly square box with a rubber
cover on five sides that has input and output for the speedo cable and
an round electrical connector. What is that part and where is it
supposed to mounted? Mine is not secured but fits snugly between the
lip of the floor and the inside of the nose behind the kick panel..
