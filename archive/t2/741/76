I can find the point of TDC for cylinder #1 witht
the little notch on the pully and alligning it to the
0 degree mark on the scale. The manual says to use
this position to find the clearance of .006" on
cyliner 1 and 3 for both the intake and exhaust
valves.  Then to rotate the pulley 180 degrees from
the notch to do cylinders 2 and 4.  I am having
difficulty knowing weather or not i am exactly 180
from the original mark on the pulley. I don't want to
set .006 at 175 degrees or something.  Any suggestions
on the valve setting?



Your dilemma was my motivation to buying a new pulley wheel with degrees 
etched on all the way round. Having gone through the valve adjustment 
with the new pulley wheel, I have to admit,  Karl's look at the valves 
moving technique is at least as good. Still, it was satisfying seeing 
that my eyes agreed with the pulley wheel markings, and I now feel a lot 
more confident adjusting the timing too. Always just set to TDC at idle, 
but now feel safe trying to achieve a maximum of 30 degrees with full 
distributor advance as described in the library.

Best #12 I have spent on ebay, and has motivated me to tidy up my engine 
bay.
