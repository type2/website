I always try to recall what in the Wilson book says when rebuilding heads.

Exhaust valve on carburated engines should be not be run for more than 50
000 miles.  30 000 on injected.  By all time I take no chance, no guess
work, and just put new exhaust valves (intakes as well).

On mechanical valves, you may have the chance to see that valve stem starts
to strech before breaking (loss of power, frequent gap adjustment).  Not too
much chance for the hydraulics as they self adjust.
