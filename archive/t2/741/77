<I'm sure the mechanic
put the Cat.Converter back in when I had the new
engine put in. That was the last time the muffler was
changed.  I can see two bolts on the bottom of the
right side. So I figure there is one on top.>

Time ot get on your old clothes, get out a flashlight and small mirror and go look and be sure. Never assume the mechanic did the right thing... <grin!> You too can be more than a tune-up mechanic. First step is learning where everything is.
