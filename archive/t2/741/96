Subject: rim color and tire selection

hi Volks well since my bus is getting laid up for a
new engine i had my garage pull my tires off my stock
rims and now i am going to pick up the rims and get
them sandblasted and powercoated. The question i have
for the list is what is the color aluminum name i tell
the powered coated and also when i get new tires what
kind should i get. I live in the eastcoast but i only
drive it in the spring/summer/fall not in the winter
so i do not need all-season any suggestions on tires 
would be great happy driving 

sincerely sam
