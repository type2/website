That depends upon how often you check them.  If you check them every 2000
miles and they're closing to .003 every time they will keep stretching
until they break.  That's how I keep track of valve condition, by
recording the valve clearances every time I check them.  Closing to zero
in 2000 miles is definitely a failure mode!
