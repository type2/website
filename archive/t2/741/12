Subject: Westy Tent.

Hello Don    I love my westy tent  They call them divorce tents LOL   the 
first time you set one up it is a pain   but if you mark the four corners  then 
it is real easy  There are only 4 different poles  the corners , the centers, 
the legs and the rest are the same except for the awning poles and I never use 
them . I can set mine up in 15 mins. and as for bulk they fit on the roof rack 
real well. I have some fold out cots and folding tables that fit nicely  more 
than doubles the living space . As others have said I only set it up if we 
are going to be there more than one night . I use to have 3 dogs that we would 
leave in the tent at night worked great and my wife loves the idea of having a 
space to stand and change  in other than the bus itself. The thing you need to 
be careful about is high winds , if you ever leave it standing you should 
always stake it down .  Taking it down is easy but I learned a trick of hooking 
the bottom to the top poles to get it off the ground so that it will dry out , 
works very well.   If you ever take more than 3 people camping then you will 
reall enjoy it.  I also use mine when going to the Vw shows to swap meet in 
which I drive my 59 panel that is always loaded with goodies  and has no place to 
sleep. I dont think you have given the tent a real good test drive yet  later 
and have fun  Mark Dearing
