ya, I'm surprised that the oil temp is high when your head temps are within  
a good range.
I prefer to keep oil temps 170-210F, and don't want it over 225.
 
Once I found an engine had one of the oil cooler seals folded over and  
partly blocking the oil flow into the cooler...

227 may  be ideal, but I don't know that it is realistic on a bus. I
hear a lot of  235 and even 265 on hot california central valley days.
I experienced  thermal breakdown of the oil at 280 with Valvoline 20-50
racing  oil.

You mentioned head temps of 300, which is really mild. 425 to 450  is
considered normal for a bus. Bear in mind the temp calibration of  the
gauge which made to read at 70 ambient  temp.
