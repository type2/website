Aircoolers,

Still not sure whether my bus is overheating or whether that's the way
it is stock/old/cheaply-rebuilt.

I did 350 miles this week end with air temps between 70 and 100
degrees. Bus loaded. Here are a few observations (in no particular
order). Gene Bergo oil sensor (on at 227 degrees /off otherwise) and
VDO heads temp gauge. Here "getting hot" = oil reaches 227 degrees.

1) with outside temperature 80 degrees it can cruise at 53 mph on flat
highway while just not getting hot.
2) with 100 degrees 20 mph headwind and light uphill it needs 25mph on
third gear to not get hot. Big rigs were doing 45mph. Four lane desert
highway with fast cars SCARY (Around Palm Springs).
3) with 90 degrees it barely does 50mph on flat highway without getting hot
4) when it gets down to 70 degrees, 60mph is doable on flat without getting
hot
5) above 80 degrees, floor it for 30 seconds and the oil gets hot. Not
forgiving !
6) As long as the VDO head gauge remains below 300 degrees, the oil
temp stays below 227 degrees. Anything warmer on the heads for a
couple minutes and oil gets hot.

I drove to ensure that the oil does not get hot. With the current
setup it clearly is not practical. Too many drivers are irritated and
make nasty signs/sounds/whatever. That even applies out of the
interstates.

The hoover bit IS missing on the bus and I'll fix ASAP. However it
might not be enought to keep the baby cool for my south west / mexican
cruises. I'll look into other solutions. Does "crud in the oil cooler"
exist ? Would it help to simply install a new oil cooler ?

The oil pressure seems OK. I cannot measure it, but the oil idiot
light never came on at idle or at any other time.

Other than that I used the new Hankook RA08 195R14 tires on the front
and they changed the ride considerably. Way more stability and easier
to turn the wheels.

Do not write to the "Bus Protection Society" I am not molesting my bus...
