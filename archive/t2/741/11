Subject: Re: [T2] Power loss after fitting new mechanical fuel pump

My "new" pump looked drastically different from the stock one in my 73.

I did make the mistake of not replacing the pump rod when I replaced
the pump. Ran sweet for 2 days then back to it's old tricks. Replaced
the rod and it's all good...
