Something was definitely wrong, though I can not guess what.  In the 
past 31 years I've owned three beetles, two busses and a Scirocco.  
NONE of these VWs EVER dropped or valve or a valve seat.  In fact, I've 
never had any sort of catastrophic of ANY sort in a VW.  Having learned 
to drive in the 60s in LA, I never learned to baby any car.  I don't 
speed too excessively but I don't obstruct traffic, either.
