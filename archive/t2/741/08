Arnaud,

I don't currently have gauges installed, so my observations are even less
scientific.  But my experience is very similar: I definitely agree that uphill
grades and outside air temperatures make a *big* difference in top speeds when
keeping the engine cool is a priority.  My Bus will run cool at 65 ad
infinitum if it's cold outside.  If it's not crisp outside, I'm not at all
comfortable cruising at 65.  More like 55-60, or 55 period if it's warm
outside.   So far, I've never driven my Bus in temperatures above 80.  I drove
to L.A. last winter, kept it at 55 through the San Joaquin valley, and the
engine stayed satisfyingly cool.

p.s. Did you really find that 25 in 3rd worked well?  I often use 25 in *2nd*
to climb hills, but... oh.. maybe the 009 is the main reason that my Bus would
tend to overheat if I tried to drive uphill at 25 in 3rd (not enough advance
to cruise under load at low rpms).
