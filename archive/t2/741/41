Mike,

Seems to me that gasoline engines -- especially smallish ones -- have been
called "motors" for a long time.  Hence "outboard motor" and "motorcycle" and
"motorglider" and so on.  Or "motor vehicle," for that matter!

I do have a tendency to call my VW's humble 1600DP an "engine," but I
certainly wouldn't fault anyone for calling it a motor.
