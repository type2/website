and then the other side of the story,  I have no tickets, no accidents,
but do live in a major metro area, downtown. have 1/2 million dollar
policy (hey I carried children in the bus) full coverage, my 78 and my
wifes 1999 S*turn. the best rate I have found is almost $1,400 every 6
months and that is with Metlife (yeah Snoopy insurance)   van is parked
off street and driven less than 15,000 miles a year, it is a daily driver.

Md Casualty was only other company that would give me full insurance
coverage.  oh at it is an assigned value policy which adds $100 every 6
months to the premium.

> accident in 2004 (which they say doesn't affect my rate), homeowner discount,

don't have homeowners insurance per se, have "equitable" policy on my
house, so don't have that discount but have all the other discounts.  Even
put security switch on ignition to get that discount.

  live in the city, great ammenities but insurance sucks.
