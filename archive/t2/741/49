Subject: Sourcing Oil Filters in a pinch

Speaking of changing your filters regularly, last week when I changed my goo, I thought I had a filter on my bench, and since it was after 7 pm I certainly hoped it was a bus filter.  But it was for my wife's Saab. So on Sunday morning I went to Schucks (Kragen) to get one - no luck- they said special order?  Since when did getting a bus filter become special order?  Next I went to a local import flaps- no go - "I can have one here on Monday $10.50 plus $3.50 shipping charge (fuel surcharge)" the dude said.  
 
Then I remembered the last filter I bought came from Fred Meyer, So I went back and in there limited auto supplies, they had about dozen Purelator Pure-One's on the shelf for $4.69 each.  
Also I remember reading an article about different filters and the Pure One's were the top rated - fram was at the bottom of the list for micron size.
 
So if you can't source a filter and are running out of time check Fred Meyer, they keep the bus/vanagon filters well stocked - at least in Seattle!
