Subject: Why SUVs?

Politics, safety(if you ignore the rollovers), advertising, the Fall ---  all 
reasons folks drive suburban assault vehicles.  But there's another that affects 
some of us boomers:  middle aged spread.  Call us larda***s or what you please, 
but some refugees from the '60 and '70 s just don't fit in anything but an SUV 
or a well designed subcompact (the engineers know they have to conserve space; 
my DH [husband] at 6'4" and 300+ lbs can usually ride in a subcompact - or an 
SUV.  sigh.)

PS.  After the second generator "exploded" the third time seems to have been a 
charge.  New generator & regulator, so far, so good.
