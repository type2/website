Hello from Canada.  My perspective..if this would not have gone down..there
would be a warehouse/warehouses.. of NOS parts..sitting under dust..and I fail
to see the 'quibble' over who gets or does what..these parts are now
available..and if you thought 'our rides' created 'folksy vendors', over
anything else..hold onto that thought..because slowly..ever so slowly, the
'market', is going upscale, where you have people who own them and love and
maintain them, and 'others', who see them as increasing capital, and will pay
big bucks to restore them for sale.  That latter group does not care who they
buy from at what cost, are only interested in a 'turnkey' ride, that someone
else builds for them..and they 'operate' the 'noveaux' VW bus market.  Just
some thoughts.
Cheers Scoggy
