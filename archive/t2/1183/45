HER DIARY

Tonight I thought he was acting weird. We had made plans to meet at a bar to
have a drink. I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he
was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment.

Conversation wasn't flowing so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we
could talk. He agreed but he kept quiet and absent. I asked him what was
wrong; he said nothing. I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. He
said it had nothing to do with me and not to worry. On the way home I told
him that I loved him, he simply smiled and kept driving. I can't explain his
behavior; I don't know why he didn't say, "I love you too."

When we got home I felt as if I had lost him, as if he wanted nothing to do
with me anymore. He just sat there and watched his computer. He seemed 
distant and
absent. Finally, I decided to go to bed. About 10 minutes later he came to
bed, and to my surprise he responded to my caress and we made love, but I
still felt that he was distracted and his thoughts were somewhere else. He
fell asleep - I cried.

I don't know what to do. I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone
else. My life is a disaster.
