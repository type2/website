Subject: RE:Hard Shifting

Ok, back from my trip out of town, and trying to go through the trouble
shooting suggestions.

 

The cable seems fine.

I checked the Transmission fluid, it was definitely low. I decided to drain
it, and replace it. I'm heading out to pick up some fluid later today.

Meanwhile I decided to check where the front shift rod engages the pin under
the seat. This looks ok, although it looks more loose than I would imagine
it should be. Then again, I've never looked at this part. How tight should
the front shift rod bushing to front of shift rod be?

 

I took the shifter off the floor, and need to re-install. I'm a bit unclear
on the sequence given in the Bentley-is there a better explanation of this
on the web?
