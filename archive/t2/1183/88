Subject: Re: [T2] GoWesty Officially Partners with Volkswagen

Sami you summed up what I was thinking.

VW coming back into a market that they abandoned.  Remember when they were
giving small suppliers a hard time about displaying the VW logo in their ads.
We were seeing ads with the VW logo blurred out on hubcaps.

Now they want to come back in to control the aftermarket, only because they
see there is money to be made.

I'm already finding myself priced out of the Buses I love.  Ridiculous prices
for buses. Absolutely ridiculous!

I sure don't want the parts to become so high I can afford them as well.

Maybe, it is a good thing.  Maybe not.  We'll all see soon enough.
