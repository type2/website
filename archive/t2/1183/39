Subject: Re: [T2] Back in the USA, and bus broke down

Update: I left the bus with the senior mechanic at Santa Monica's BMW
dealership. He spent his formative years at VW in Germany and enjoys
the break from the 330s and 550s :)

It's a bit unsettling for me to leave bus repairs to someone else, but
after years of neglect (career and family, not necessarily in that
order, were just more important) and then a long-distance relationship
(as the bus moved to California and I moved to Europe), I shouldn't be
too upset about that.

So, last year's KBS fuel tank restoration coating is fine and is NOT
peeling off. The fuel filter is clean. The problem was with the fuel
pump relay (double-relay). And the fuel pump was also marginal and
needed to be replaced.

Our California road trip will resume Sunday, as we'll leave Topanga on
our way up north and hit one of the state parks in the San Luis Obispo
area (recommendations anyone?), then continue North to see family in
Monterey (should I take Hwy 1 or 101? I think I'll pick 101 as it's
easier to get towed from there, ha!). And on Wednesday, we'll head to
Livermore to see my wife's dad.

Once there, I'll have a couple of weeks in a shaded, decently equipped
spot to spend some quality time with "Rocinante" (or should I call it
"Dapple"?)

Thanks again for all the help!
