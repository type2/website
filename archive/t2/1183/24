Subject: Don't mix synth with dino oil (Re: [VB] hot running motor)

Well, it seems as though this - mixing synthetic oil with regular oil - 
was the problem: I changed my oil twice and the problem went away.  
Either that or the oil I put in there had something else wrong with it.

Thanks Volks!

Cheers,
