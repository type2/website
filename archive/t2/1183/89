People have written on T2 that they bolt in new units that are designed for 
Vanagons, Golfs, etc, with very little modification or work-around. Check 
the archives for "wiper motor repair" discussion on January 15, 2010.

I sent you my Jan 15, 2010 files in a private post, and would do the same 
for anyone else interested.
