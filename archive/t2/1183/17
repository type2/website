Excellent writeup.  What grits did you end up using out of the selection you
purchased, or did I miss that?

Thanks

Over the years I've been the paintjob helper. I've done some small parts but
I was always reliant on someone else's expertise for the tough parts. This
paint job I want to be "right" and I want to the body man AND the paint man
AND have the paint turn out right so I'm doing some experimentation.
