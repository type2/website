Subject: How to tell L from R brake calipers - 77 Westy ATEs

So I'm eyeballing these two rebuilt ATE calipers that came with different part
no's and I can't tell what makes them different??? They appear to be identical
as to up or down, so either left or right? Are they interchangeable? These
also fit the early vanagons, so I thought I'd post it to the vanagon list as
well.
Thanks,
Courtney
