New update, quick, before the type2 server goes down.

No further problems driving from the LA area along the coast and to
our destination in Livermore. Beautiful drive with overnight stays at
Montana de Oro near San Luis Obispo, and then family in Monterey.

Good power; top end power had been poor, with max speed at 55; now
with the new fuel pump, can easily go 65 or more. But I didn't push
it, drove 50 to 55 most of the way.

One problem, though: sometimes high rpm at idle. Suspect was a gritty,
sticky vacuum advance plate in the distributor. I took it apart this
morning and sure enough, it needed a thorough cleaning. I reassembled
dry, but was wondering what list wisdom says about proper lube between
the two plates.

(A stuck vacuum advance plate at highway cruising might also explain
oil temp variations, that could not be explained by other
environmental factor.)

Also had a peek into the centrifugal advance mechanism and noticed one
of the springs was not connected at one end. Put it back in place, cut
a small square from a heat shrink tube, poked a hole in it and slipped
it over the spring hook, then heat shrunk it into place. This should
keep the spring from popping off.
