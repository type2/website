How far, and how fast, and what terrain.  I've always been a king of towing
with underpowered and underbraked vehicles.  If the route is mostly flat,
perhaps only small grades here and there, I think power wise you will be fine.
 You can compression brake on grades, but you ain't going to stop fast in an
emergency.  The flip is that the load itself probably isn't a lot more than
the load rating of the truck itself, once moving up to speed with 4 on the
ground braking is indeed your bigger concern.

I used my past '70 SC once to
tow a Ghia from St. Louis to WV, with a 1600 SP no less.  Did fine over that
route, but I sure couldn't stop fast.

If you have an RV'er friend who tows
something flat, they may have one of those braking systems (Blue Ox) that sits
on the seat an applies the pedal if the bug has brakes.  They are really
pricey ($1000), but tend to sit in somebodies garage for 50 weeks a year.
