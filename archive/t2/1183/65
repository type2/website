About 1/2 way down shows all the parts.

Good price on the full kit as well
($30) if the pricing is still good.

Also
have the T2 thickness joints for "racing" that have bigger balls and relief
for more suspension angle in the regular thickness, not that it matters so
much, nothing wrong with the T4/924/944 ones, which are likely old German if
used and probably infinitely better quality.

Are you sure?  It doesn't look like there's any
way that the boot I listed can attach to that flange.
