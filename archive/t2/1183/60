Subject: Question about Empi CV boots

Does anyone have any input on these CV boots:

http://www.socalautoparts.com/empi-cv-axle-boot-fits-type-cv-offroad-black-p-17048.html

It's looking like I'll need to use these because the standard 
metal/rubber boots are causing binding due to the balls hitting the 
metal flange.  The above boots look like they attach to the outside of 
the CV joint meaning that the balls are free to do their thing.  Your 
input would be appreciated.

Thanks!
Mike
