Subject: A 'Fix", I found

Gruppe, needed a 'flexible line' to mount my oil pressure aftermarket gauge
sender, from motor through tin and out, to avoid any interference from Dizzy,
on my '74 Westy 1.8L  Was trying different modes, when in my right hand was a
SS flex brake line from a '74 beetle (no use to me, but can't return it), and
in my left hand the factory sender..and they had the same thread, so tried it
in hole, tightened it down,'bent' it to where ever I wanted and a lot more
possibilities as to where to mount sender, without an interfernce fit from
dizzy,..and most of all..the other end, fits the gauge sender!  Sometimes if
your given lemons..make lemonade!!  Special thanks to the "karma
Brothers"..Coutenay Hook and Phil Murphy..when those guys are around..just
good VW Karma happen
