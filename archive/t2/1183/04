Subject: Re: [VB] 15" Tires

Tom,

Yeah, there is limited choices on rubber for 15" rims as far as I 
know. I have 15" rims on my bus. I have used michelin passenger car 
tires in the past P205-75-15's with the radial R in there somewhere. 
Currently I have Bridgestones which are no longer available in that 
size. Anyway, they don't fit all the way into the spare tire well in 
my non-walk thru causing my 2/3 passenger seat to sit forward a 
little. Fish around a bit and you should find something suitable as 
for the 4" wides, maybe those are bug rims? I'm sure mine are 5 or 
5.5".

So a couple of years ago I bought some 15" rims from Clara with the
intent to achieve lower RPMs through "rubber gearing".

However, i never ended up getting any tires put on them because I
couldn't find any tires that met the narrow rim requirement of the
splitty rims (which are what, 4")?  All the 15" tires I found had a
rim width spec of >5" or 5.5" IIRC.

Any thoughts on this apparent mismatch and whether it's safe to go
with the wider-rim tire on splitty rims?

I'm going to replace my tranny, so I could also go with the Freeway
flier, but I thought I'd inquire as to your experiences.

Cheers,
    Tom
