Got the 34pict3 working all OK.

Combination of ...
Getting the settings set just right,
running fuel cleaner through the jets,,,, (seems to be the major 
solution issue)
tweaking the choke setting.

New engine runs absolutely awesome, and not a hint of an oil leak 
anywhere to be found.

Yeah, I feel pretty good about the whole effort!
