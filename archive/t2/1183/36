Subject: Re: [T2] A 'Fix", I found

Don't want to rain on the parade, but for anyone else so trying not really the
"same thread."  The brake line is straight thread on both ends (female and
male) and that the case and sender are tapered pipe thread.  Now on a plus
side, if it is to be believed that senders and cases are truly a tapered
metric 10mm thread with a 1mm pitch, at least that is true and correct of the
brake line.  Straight thread into taper, or taper into straight thread (you
are doing both here) will certainly work up to a point, particularly with a
good sealant.  Is it right, well no, is it more/less right than using 1/8-27
NPT, well hard to say, at least that is tapered, gets up to 10.4mm (and is
tapered so is well withing range through the taper) but has a .94mm pitch
so...

If it don't leak, the proof that it works is in the pudding, hopefully
it continues to do so without damage.  The bitty issue probably being the male
brake hose into the aluminum case as only the first thread is really engaged
fully as it buries in the taper, the rest less so the further up/out you get.
 For 50-60 psi oil though, probably OK, but time, fatigue, etc.

on my '74
Westy 1.8L  Was trying different modes, when in my right hand was a
SS flex
brake line from a '74 beetle (no use to me, but can't return it), and
in my
left hand the factory sender..and they had the same thread, so tried it
in
hole, tightened it down,
