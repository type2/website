Didn't even think of trying to expand the PEX, I just used short  
pieces of hose (1-2") as couplers with a smear of Permatex #3 and a  
clamp on each end.   I've got a non-standard engine in my '75 and  
creative solutions were needed in several places.

And on that note, if anyone wants pics of a VW inline swap in pieces,  
let me know because it's all apart right now with the '84 JH 1.8L  
bottom end being replaced by a '95 ABA 2.0L out of a Jetta .. keeping  
the JH counterflow head though.
