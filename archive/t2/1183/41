Hi Sami,
        Here are a couple of refs that you might find useful during your
"quality time".

testing fuel pressure

AFM adjustment

It could be that your AFM wipers have worn through the carbon in spots and are
intermittently failing to provide an air flow signal.  Fairly easy to move the
board a minute amount so the wipers are on good solid carbon.  The current
view is it's best not to tweak the wipers themselves, at all.  I spent a day
trying minor adjustments inside my AFM and learned a lot.  Write your changes
down each time. Scribe mark the original positions FIRST THING.

Giving your harness plug connections a spray of  Deoxit.

I use the DeoxIT. D-Series D100S Spray, 100% solution, 57 g, no solvents,
metered one-shot valve dispenses 100% DeoxIT.

One can will last a very long time as you only need to use a very small
amount.

I get mine from Micro-Tools in Vacaville
