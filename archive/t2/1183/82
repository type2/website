Hmmn,

If by professional you mean, flashy website and often ridiculously and
ruthlessly overpriced, well certainly they do, and have.  Definitely I'll say
GoWesty will be right at home with historical VW price structure, and I
imagine Ron and others will keep buying NLA and NOS parts from whomever they
have all along.  Hopefully the "exclusivity" doesn't negatively impact his and
other vendors ability to bring in OEM VW South America that still is/recently
was in production.

No offense meant to any
vendors out there, but my perception out here in consumerland is that GoWesty
runs a much more professional outfit than the others.  It feels much more like
a real professional retail outfit than the others.   The others feel more like
home based internet mail order outfits.
