Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Hose (HARD PLASTIC)

Wirsbo PEX expander tool/die from a buddy who is a plumber?

They are
the original quality name in PEX and unlike all the others do not rely on
crimping in reduced diameter fittings but instead expand the hose, which you
slide over a full bore fitting.  Would probably work out about perfect.   It
will creep back tight to original size (which is how it works in use) and in
point of fact is just like how the OEM presumably nylon goes on the valve.
Technically BTW only their style of PEX truely should be heated to restore (or
deform) form though that is a technicality for behind wall don't want it to
fail in 20 years water installation.  PEX does UV degrade as well, but it
might be quite a while.

Did you come up with a good way to
expand it so that it fits on the valve?  Heating it up makes it flexible, but
I'm trying to figure out the best way to expand the end without distorting
it.
