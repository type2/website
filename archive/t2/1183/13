Subject: Re: [T2] bus towing capacity

You do see em down around $300-500 on CL (and perhaps *bay) occasionally, the
older less cool looking ones, but still the same thing underneath.  RV people
only use em for break a way braking mostly, unless they are towing a monster
TOW'd, as they usually got plenty of braking capacity.  But in a lot of states
(and all of Canada I think) you got to have break a way.  I think close and
flat with the '59 entirely up to snuff William is fine as is, but if he rides
someones ass in town, he might make his own 3 car pileup pretty easily.

I was thinking that same thing as John. 
Meaning ask someone with a Blue Ox
braking system.
They just sit in place and hook up real easy.
You might even
see if there is a rental place that has them.
