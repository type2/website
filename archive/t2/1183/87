Subject: Re: [T2] GoWesty Officially Partners with Volkswagen

So VW decides to re-enter a market they had abandoned. I'm not so sure
it's GREAT news:
(1) Best-case scenario: new, heretofore unavailable parts are now
offered in sufficient quantities and at sufficiently reasonable prices
to help us keep our air-cooled VWs on the road.
(2) Worst-case scenario: parts that had been available through other
channels are now sold exclusively by a monopolist.

Furthermore, if you look at GoWesty prices, especially those that
fully restored campers command, we are talking about an upscale,
luxury market. For VAG, this is not a Bob Hoover world of autarky and
ingenuity anymore, but a market with consumers willing to pay large
amounts of money to look good. Plus, as old veedubs are morphed into
Classic Volkswagens, they become moving advertisements for the brand
and its reliability.

BTW, GoWesty does more than sell parts, they actually restore
vehicles; and they know how to market them for top price. I think
that's what sets them apart from the other parts vendors. (A smart
move by VW, though, not to entrust their dealerships with NOS parts,
as those no longer have the knowledge and talent to work efficiently
on old models.)
