No offense meant to any vendors out there, but my perception out here in 
consumerland is that GoWesty runs a much more professional outfit than 
the others.  It feels much more like a real professional retail outfit 
than the others.   The others feel more like home based internet mail 
order outfits.

Just my $0.02 from way out here in consumerland.
