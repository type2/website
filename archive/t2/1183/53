John,

There are plenty of campervan and caravan outfitters that could build
one to spec, but i can't think of any that have the modules off-the-shelf.

I
did a little searching and you may want to get in touch with the following as
some of them state they do or can do a split-screen Devon interior.
Check out
the photos to see if they jive with what you have.

Anyone have a source for devon stuff? I have a few devon bits but
I'm
thinking I'd like to put a devon interior in my 60. Is there a source for
aftermarket devonrepro stuff?
