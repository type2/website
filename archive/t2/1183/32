What's the number on the side of the distributor?  And do you have  
fuel injection or carbs?

That information will help us determine if you've got the right  
distributor, and therefore the right cap/rotor...

I personally haven't heard of coils burning out that fast in quick  
succession...very odd.

Cheers,
    Tom
