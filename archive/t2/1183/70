anyone live near woods hole? Going on vacation with the family next week,
rented a house starting sunday, but ferry for the car is 6am monday(just
informed of this today), so sunday night I will be sleeping in my Jeep Liberty
so I can get it on the ferry 6am monday. There is no parking lot at the ferry,
thats what the woman on the phone today said, so I need a driveway to sleep
in, becaue I am not spending over $200 for a room for one night for me.
