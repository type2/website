When I call Bus Depot (my first choice) I usually get someone who knows 
the parts and the buses.
and I get a fair price and the parts usually arrive a day or two later. 
(ok I am fairly close by)

have never gotten anything from GoWesty in less than a week, that's fine 
if my bus were not my daily driver...  something breaks I gotta get it 
running as soon as possible.
