the only time I have seen coils burn out is 
when the ignition was on, but engine not running and points were closed. 
coil will get very hot very fast and essentially melt.
I have never seen one catch fire.

maybe there is a problem with power still being fed to the coil when 
ignition is off, (wiring problem) no coil is going to fix this, need to 
find the bad wire run.
