Subject: Re: [T2] Question about Empi CV boots

Pretty sure, the whole kit is 86-9303, the boot 9304, and the flange 9305 in
case you needed it separately.  They are/were cheapest as the whole kit.  That
boot isn't as big on the bottom as you think it is.  There are 930 style boots
that do what you think, but I've never seen at T2/T4 one that does.

Another
source, listed with the original EMPI number (though the Kartek number is
actually the same):

9304-bus-cv-boot-empi-10mm/ 


But I'd stress the whole kit can be found
cheaper than the parts still I think.

 I didn't realize until today that your
924/944 CV's are in fact the Type 4 CV's which is what we scrounged in yards
for sandrails in WV, neat reference site here.
