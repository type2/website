Subject: Re: [T2] Question about Empi CV boots

They actually go with these Mike EMPI 86-8305:
http://www.kartek.com/product/DriveTrain/CV/Flanges/VWType.html 


Or the
equivalent from SoCal.   Or the whole kit is 86-9303.  They work like a champ.
 I'd note that not all "stock" T2 boots are created equally and some of them
have more clearance, some have less, so you might take a close look at stock
assemblies first, at least ones with the ball reliefs, though even then, not
all created equally.

I will say though, last time I bought a set, EMPI oddly
compared to so many of their products, at least made a great CV boot
for longevity.

Kartek has a nice guide of the SAW 33 spline axle choices you
have as well.

It's looking like I'll need to use these because
the standard metal/rubber boots are causing binding due to the balls hitting
the metal flange.  The above boots look like they attach to the outside of the
CV joint meaning that the balls are free to do their thing.  Your input would
be appreciated.
