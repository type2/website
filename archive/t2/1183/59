Subject: Steve Dolan's '67 Bus

Volks,

Steve Dolan's brother Jim is going to auction off Steve's 1967 hardtop  
camper via a silent auction.

I don't have any pictures of the bus, but I do know that Kelly  
(MetWiz) did all the metal work and that Mark Dearing did the paint.   
I believe it has the standard Westy interior and that interior is  
probably in "fair" to "decent" condition.

I know very little about the bus otherwise.  I *think* it has a beater  
engine in it (as opposed to a fresh mexi-1600dp), but I could be wrong.

If you're interested in bidding on the bus, please send your bid to  
Jim Dolan:  jimtd83(-at-)gmail.com

Here are the details from Jim:

- Minimum bid $5,000
- Bidding closes at 11:59 pm, Sun, Aug 5
- I will be there (Alexandria, VA) Saturday, 11 am - 3 pmif anyone  
wants a look inside the van.
- Buyer should plan to pick up the van the weekend of Aug 11-12
- No promises that the van can be driven, or made driveable, or made  
to pass inspection, etc.

Please don't distribute this email beyond immediate friends or old  
list members.  Jim (and I think all of us) are interested in Steve's  
bus going to a good home, and hopefully someone who will really  
appreciate it.

Let me know if I can help answer any questions...I don't know that  
I'll be able to, but I'll try.

Cheers,
     Tom
