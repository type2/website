Subject: Re: [T2] GoWesty Officially Partners with Volkswagen

Hmmn,

I'm worrying far more about #2 than betting on #1.  I think VW is
eyeing this more along the lines of MB Classic, as in, wow we can sell off
whatever we still have floating around NOS for crazy ridiculous amounts to
idiots with more money than sense, than as how they can start re-supplying
neat parts for a market segment they have ignored for 20-30 years.
 Fortunately the parts they do control with exclusivity are probably mostly
Vanagon bits that no-one else has cared to repop, but there are the baywindow
body rubbers, panels, etc that were still being made in SA.

I have only
perhaps 3 times in the last 10-15 years bought anything from GoWesty, I've had
many a deep gut level chuckle at idiots who would pay $50-100k for one of
their Vanagons, though I can't say that I didn't appreciate what they did for
the market when I flipped my last 2 syncro Westys.  I have had many a similar
laugh at those who bought big GoWesty waterboxers for their incredible level
of "support" (little) instead of making smarter engine choices.

And of course
over the years I've been pretty hard on Ron or anyone else when they were what
I felt was overpriced as well.  But I doubt this news will have me surfing
over to pay GoWesty 40-50% more for something I can get elsewhere, only I hope
the elsewhere supplies won't dry up on account of this.

One would do well to
recall VW's classic pricing structure on parts going obsolete, which basically
was always, the fewer they had, the more they cost, even if the less the
demand.  Until said parts could have been made of solid gold, oh yeah, GoWesty
there we are.

YMMV.
John

So VW
decides to re-enter a market they had abandoned. I'm not so sure
it's GREAT
news:
(1) Best-case scenario: new, heretofore unavailable parts are now
offered in sufficient quantities and at sufficiently reasonable prices
to help
us keep our air-cooled VWs on the road.
(2) Worst-case scenario: parts that
had been available through other
channels are now sold exclusively by a
monopolist.
