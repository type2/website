Subject: Re: [T2] Temporary filling of holes in rocker panels???

<<1) Use undercoating spray on cardboard to create a patch. Let it dry,
then cover the cardboard from the outside with spray on undercoat so it
is waterproof.>> 

You won't be able to seal the inside of the cardboard--it'll soon get
spongy.


<<2) Make a plug of expanding foam for a temporary fix, cover with
undercoat.>>

Good idea.
The expanding foam dispalces water ---BUT--You'll play hell getting it
outa the holes when your ready to weld up the new panel's---
This stuff sticks real good to anything it dries up against.
 
<<2) Use a single thickness mat and fiberglass for a temporary fix that
can be ground off later.>>

This sounds like the best idea of the three.

It'll slow down any more water from getting into the panel's --and all
ya have to do is grind it off.
Not too difficult of a task.
