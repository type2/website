Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus owner need help identifying part

From Zach Drew:

I understand that holes in this part could cause the engine to run
lean(thanks Karl).  That being said Karl also stated that it could cause a
vacuum leak as well.  If I am not mistaken the brake servo operates off
the vaccuum system does it not?  If my brake servo doesn't work, couldn't
this be part of the problem?

No, your power brakes work off manifold vacuum. 

The EGR filter will not affect booster vacuum. 

Booster vacuum is line A here:

It connects to B on the left side of the plenum.
