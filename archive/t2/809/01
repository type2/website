I haven't seen one like that.

I don't think the Porsche tool is suitable for VW heads but it can be  
bought with .006/.15mm sized replaceable blades.

I don't know who makes the Wurth tool but they are popular with the  
BMW crowd:

They cost $2.90/ea.

I only adjust valves for friends but I find the snapon feelers  
affordable and durable:

See FB322 under bent and step blades.
