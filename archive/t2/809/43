Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus owner need help identifying part

It is part of the smog devices, this part is not
needed, cut the line at the muffler and weld it shut,
cut the line at the air box about a inch from where it
goes into the plentum, put some sealer in the pipe and
pinch it shut. Remove all the left over pices of the
pipe & box , should be held on the tin by 10mm bolts.
Good luck with you bus . Phil
