Subject: Re: New Bus owner need help identifying part

 >On an quasi-related sidenote, I am not planning a full resto but more of a
resto/upgrade as I plan to use this for camping.  Is there a "laundry
list" of things I should be aware of as a new bus owner and or a list of
things that should be replaced?  My fuel lines are all the braided cloth
type, should I replace these?  I am planning a complete electrical rebuild
as I plan on adding solar and 110 capabilities.  Thanks in advance for any
info.


To save yourself a lot of potential grief I would do the following. Not 
only replace the fuel lines but all rubber hoses including the vacuum hoses 
and brake hoses. Also check the condition of the various rubber boots over 
joints under the vehicle and the rubber disk at the base of the steering 
wheel. While you're under the bus is a good time to check for things that 
are missing/loose/rusted/damaged etc. I'd also take off the rear wheels and 
drums and check the condition of the wheel cylinders (leaking?) and other 
brake parts.

On the electrical side I would replace all the fuses and the ignition 
components (spark plugs, leads, distributor cap, rotor button, coil(?)) as 
a bit of preventive maintenance. This will at least get these bits to a 
known good state.

Cheers,

Martin
