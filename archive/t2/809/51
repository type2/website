I think you will get a better result if you cut out the bad skin,
flange the edges, and cut a piece from the new skin to fit. This will
give you a flush fit. Seam sealer could then be used to smooth the
edges if you don't want to weld and grind.

 If you want to work with the skins on the dog legs, you have two options:
 drill out the spot welds in the wheel arch and cut the old skin close to the
 seam at the B-pillar and along the top edge. Then weld in new skin.
 Alternatively, you could cut out the rust spots, treat the old skin and then
 glue the replacement skin over the old one with one of these modern body
 adhesives (I have not tried this yet, but this appears to be good
 application for adhesives since it is mostly cosmetic and not structural).
