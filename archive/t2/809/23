Well, the last stranded bus driver I stopped to help was in exactly that
fix, right at the intersection of US395 and CA14 (two major highways) in
SoCal.  No cell service!  luckily, his problem was a bum coil which we
diagnosed by swapping my coil to his bus.  A quick detour to Ridgecrest
and he was fixed up.

There was life before cell phones.  Folks simply stopped and helped each
other out.  Seems that instead of bringing us together, cell phones have
just given some folks another excuse for leaving others stranded at the
side of the road.  Sad.

Story time.  When I grew up in central Nevada in the early '60s, cell
phones were not even a glimmer yet.  2-way radios were primitive,
unreliable and expensive.  This was The Boonies, and if you broke down
you could die before anyone else happened along.  Everyone drove pickups
and it was common practice to carry two old tires in the bed at all times.
If you broke down, you built two fires a couple of hundred yards apart and
threw one tire on each fire.  Two plumes of black smoke was the signal
that someone needed help.

Smoke signals to satellites in 40 years!  Whatta life!
