Subject: carbon (i think) on the rotor and distributor cap nipple thingy

just took goethe out on the freeway for the first time in a while. she drove
great for a while then started some very gentle hiccuping. not a lot just
barely there, in fact. when i pulled off the freeway and up the off ramp she
idled really low and barely made it up the hill. got her into a filling
station lot and pulled the distibutor cap and saw dusty debris which i think
is carbon deposits on the rotor center and the thing that hangs down in the
center of the cap to distibute the spark. cleaned this off the bus started
up well and off we drove. pulled over a while later and pulled #4 plug. it
was fouled except for the part that sparks. i assume the whole thing was
fouled, covered in black soot like substance, but when i cleaned the rotor
and cap the spark cleaned up the electrode. anyway, what would cause the
carbon deposits on the rotor and cap? i am running a FI 75 with a
flamethrower coil and petronix ingnition and bosch plugs.
   thanks in advance.
