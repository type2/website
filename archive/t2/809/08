John,

	I don't what the seat belt bolt size was in the bays.  Most older
vechicles have 1/2-20 or 7/16-20, yes even the "foreign" cars to match
the US Federal Motor Vechicle Safety Standard that mentions bolt size. 
Today, most car are using M12-1.75 (funny almost all of the US cars now
use M12, while plenty of the inport still use 7/16-20 - go figure).    If
you van has 7/16-20, one option is to drill out the hole to accept a
M12-1.75 Thread rolling screw seat belt bolt, used on all Ford and Chevys
(note 7/16 is approx 11.00mm in dia.  I can provide a real seat belt bolt
to you (free) and guidance on the hole size.  See www.taptite.com for
details on the bolt.

These TAPTITE(r) thead rolling bolts were first used on the 1964 1/2
Mustang (1/2-13 size then) so they have been used for a long, long time.

 my mother-in-law arrives for a visit this afternoon, so i had to put the
 middle bench seat in for the extra seating.  One of the holes in the
 floor that receives the seatbelt is stripped / rusted / whatevered and
no
 longer grips the botl.  having a 7 pass 6 seatbelt bus is OK i guess,
but
 i would like to be able to have the option to belt someone into that
 seat.  is this another application for the timesert like when my oil
 drain plug stripped the threads out of the case, or am i looking at a
 more difficult fix?
