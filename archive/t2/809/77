Look at the wiring loom coming out of the ignition switch.  On my '71 I
found an unconnected wire that actually had voltage on it only when the
key was off!  Perfect for the application you anticipate.

All you have to do is get a super-bright red LED with a dropping resistor
for 12V.  Wire it between the hot terminal and ground and you'll be in
business.  One LED will run continuously for many days without depleting
the battery excessively.
