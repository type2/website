 My wife was talking on the phone to her aunt tonight. Pretty funny listening
 to her talk herself into loving the bus again, during the course of a 10
 minute conversation! Starts out: "Yeah, it's old and seems to break all the
 time..." Then, "Well, 99% of the time Don can fix it in just a few minutes."
 Finally, "Yeah, I love that bus. It's just so perfect for trips!"
