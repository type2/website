Subject: Let's do it again!

Engine is out. (again)  At least with the repetition I got it out within 45min by myself.   I'm going to repair/replace the head(s).  One is bad, but I might do both?.   What else should I target in order to keep from removing the engine within 3 months.  Here is my current list.
 
Heads
Oil cooler gasket / seal
Thermostat
Seal known oil leaks (oil filter flange, oil filler tube)
 
I have good compression as stated before and I have been told that removing the heads may cause me to loose the seal with the cylinder heads to the block.  Should I clamp them down with something?
 
I always look forward to your responses.  
 
Thanks in advance,
cp
