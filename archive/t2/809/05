WOW!!!  Our very own Vincent got his book finished!

No wonder he has been so quiet lately.  Last time we e-mailed he talked 
about it and getting close, but was getting ready to start a new job as 
well.

Wonder if he got to work on his Champagne edition much yet?

If Vincent and his buddy wrote the book, thn there will be some very good 
info in it.

I want one!

Cheers, dave
