I'm seeing a goodly amount of drops in the morning when I leave the Westy
sitting overnight on the driveway. I'm suspecting pushrod tube seals on the
engine side. On the Type 4 engine, I believe I can remove the tubes while
the engine is in place, correct? I would like to replace them all with viton
ones and make this thing oil tight.



Thanks,

Courtney
