I can see it now:

"Cruise the world on the SS Ben Pon"

No need for a cabin, live in your Westy!

Roll on / Roll off service at all ports of call!

The concierge will arrange for all vehicle and passengerpaperwork wherever
you go!

Forget the fancy cruise ship cuisine!  Beer and Brats on deck every
evening.  Pancake breakfast in the mornings.
