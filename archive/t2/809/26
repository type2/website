Nope, 1435 is the number.  The lower profile tires have less load capacity
than the taller profiles.  A 185R14 in load range C will have sufficient
load capacity, but if you want to run a 195/75R14 you have to get load
range D to get it.

The sidewall of virtually any radial tire you'd put on a bus will be 2
plies.  The tread will be four plies, two of which are steel.  The varying
strengths come from the design of the plies, not the number.

The ply rating is a vestigial leftover from the transition between cotton
plies in tires and synthetic.  The synthetics were a lot stronger than
cotton, but people were used to judging the strength of tires by the
number of plies.  They'd go past a 4-ply polyester tire and buy a
weaker 6-ply cotton tire simply because 6 was more than 4.  The "ply
rating" was invented to help sell the synthetic tires.

The _real_ number to look at is the maximum load in pounds.  That number
isn't as subject to twiddling as the others.
