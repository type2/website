LOL!

I'm not talking about the sealant, I'm just grousing about how my tube was
fine until I pulled off the fan shroud and it cracked. Then I had to drive
around pouring oil out of it until I got a new one. ;-) They, like the alt
boot, are wonderfully flexible when new. Too bad they don't stay that way...
