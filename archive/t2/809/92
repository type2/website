I think if you have a bunch of manual dexterity Courtney, and can twist
and turn like Harry Houdini, you may be able tho get away without
dropping the engine.

I know of no one who has gotten away without doing this unsavory task.

Too much garbage in the way--like sheet metal for instance, aluminum
cover's & shrouds.

It would be a much simpler job with the engine in your lap.

I have never heard of anyone removing the tubes without cutting them
first and replacing them with spring loaded tubes.

A real crummy job on an air cooled engine.


Hasta,
