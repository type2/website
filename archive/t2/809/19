1435 lbs is below the safe load capacity for a VW Bus. 

If using a light truck tire, you need a minimum of 1520 lbs load capacity
(load index 95 or above). If it is a P-rated (passenger car) tire, you need
at least 1670 lbs load capacity (load index 99 or above). This is because
according to the U.S. D.O.T.'s tire safety requirements, a passenger car
tire's stated load capacity must be de-rated by 9.1% if mounted on a light
truck (as a VW bus is classified).
