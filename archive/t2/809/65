Marcus,
I wasen't advocatiing using the crazy foam--not at all.
I was just retorting to the other guys posting that  the foam invited
further rusting--which is doesn't.

I told you that a quick fiberglass cloth, and resin deal wioild close
the hole up the easiest, and be removed the easiest , and be pretty
bullet proof until you get around to doing the body work in sheet metal.

Now---as far as having a difficult time with welding the interior of the
panels you intend to hang.
3-M body panel adhesive is used by most new car manufacture's, does, and
will add structural strength to the bonded area. 

Whoever thnks it doesn't is in for a big suprise.
This adhesive is the strogest I've ever seen , displaces water at the
bond, and will never come apart.

Use it for when you hang the rocker's.
Spot weld in the corner's is all that's needed for a professional, long
lasting, top shelf job.
