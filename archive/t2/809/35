Subject: Re: [T2] Temporary filling of holes in rocker panels???

A temp fix for holes if you have decent paint around them to keep out 
water is to use aluminum tape- you can use the duct tape at home depot 
(2" wide) or the fancy stuff found in the auto repair section.  I use 
rubbing compound followed by a fast solvent wash where the tape will 
sit. You can overlap sections; start at the bottom.
    It will easily paint to match your panel and lasts as long as the 
metal around it.  The adhesion is amazing.  Make sure no water can 
collect; ie make sure drain holes are open and not full of rust silt.

Expanding foam will work if the cavity is really DRY and you fill it up 
completely to let no more water in.  Downside is if water seeps in 
around the foam it will collect and hasten rust.
