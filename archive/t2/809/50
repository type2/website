Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus owner need help identifying part

A learning experience for me all around.  Thanks for the link Karl, had
seen that one around before I bought the bus and hadn't really explored it
too deeply.  Mike, thanks for the suggestions and the additional info.  At
this point I think I am going to dig through the ratwell site some more
and go from there.  Thanks again all for your input and assistance with
identifying this part.  I thought a fire extinguisher was standard equip
for this model :-)
