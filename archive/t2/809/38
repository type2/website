I remember back in the early 80's using that square signpost with all 
the 3/8" holes drilled along the sides (yes it was a scrounged "run 
over" one- usually found somewhere along the road)- cut it down and used 
it to weld (or was it braze then>) to the old bottom part of a  shock 
tower to provide a mount for the shock!  Have also used it to construct 
a tow hitch to tow a parts bus.
