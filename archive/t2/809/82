This might be a plus, as far as getting your bus back.  If you have a
disabler that prevents the vehicle from starting, the thief might diagnose
it and bypass it in the privacy of your driveway.  Having the bus stall in
traffic might actually be good, as a thief doesn't really want to draw
attention to himself by attempting to restart the bus.  He'll just bail
out and leave the bus.

Of course, most pro thieves use flatbed trucks.  Hard to fight that.  A
friend of mine was at work in the wee hours and saw a flatbed dropping a
car off in the business' lot.  Sure enough, when the cops ran the VIN it
came up stolen and it had been pretty well stripped.  Still, my friend got
the license number of the tow truck for the cops.
