Subject: Re: [T2] Temporary filling of holes in rocker panels???

<< foam just soak up moisture and make things even worse.>>

Nyet.

DYK that the expanding foam actually displaces moisture?

3-M sold a product for years, and there are a few other that will
actually displace H2O.
 Once this stuff get's onto any surface you'll never get it off.

Not without TNT anyway.

Get some of it onto your hands, and let it dry--real good.

Let me know how you got it off.

It'll be a good temporary hole filler alright.

It'll just be hell to get it outa there when it's rocker panel time.

I'll even tell you guys where I used it once.
I had a real cheap customer, and he had a Mack with the whole panel over
the windshield --from the right door post to the left rotten--gone.
All that was left was the rubber windshield moulding on top.

He wouldn't pop a dime to replace the upper panel--- 

OK--I'll fix him I thought----

I went to the body shop supply store and picked up a can of this foam
filler.
It's the same as the Great stuff from Home Depot.

I taped off the windshield, and the roof drip moulding and loaded this
truck up with the Foam-O---

The next morning the stuff grew over the windshield.
I was thinking the headliner would blow outa the truck.

I took a hack saw blade and trimmed the excess off--and that's it--no
more.

That area never rusted up , or to the inside panels.
It stopped dead.

The stuff was in that truck until the day the junkman towed it
away---and I think that was about 7-8 more years.

It does work.

However, I thank God the fool never changed his mind and wanted the
panel done right.
It would have been a nightmare to dig all the garbage out from above the
windshield moulding.

It would work in the rocker area very well.
