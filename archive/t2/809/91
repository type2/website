What is amazing about this stuff it seal's lie a vice grip, but yet
peels off when you want it too like a rubber band. 

Have you used it ??
tried it?

I'll tell ya who turned me onto it.
My good friend is The master mechanic at Roger's Chevrolet in Rantoul
IL.

When GM quit using gaskets in their engine's this is the stuff that
replaced them.

When I converted my 74 to hydraulic's, and put the stainless valves and
hardened seats in it, this is what used on every gasket , & o-ring.

I just got done doing the had seals on one of my Vanagons. 

Used the same stuff.

They are both as tight as a Fat Ladies Sox.

I highly recommend this product--it works very good, and doesn't ooze
out, make the gaskets slip outa place, or you can use it in leau of a
gasket.

Try it--you'll like it.
