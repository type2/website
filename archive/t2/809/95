When we bought our 82 Westy off ebay, a trucker hauled it from New
York and brought it to our home. When he arrived in our neighborhood,
the cops showed up because someone reported it as suspiciuos activity.

 Of course, most pro thieves use flatbed trucks.  Hard to fight that.  A
 friend of mine was at work in the wee hours and saw a flatbed dropping a
 car off in the business' lot.  Sure enough, when the cops ran the VIN it
 came up stolen and it had been pretty well stripped.  Still, my friend got
 the license number of the tow truck for the cops.
