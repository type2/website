Subject: RE: [T2] How difficult is it to replace doglegs and rocker

Most of the patch panel that are only skins are supposed to be welded over
the existing remains. Not a good solution, but often times the only economic
one if you have to repair rust on an old beater to make it through
inspection (read: the German TUEV) rather than restoring a vehicle. Often
times such panels are oversized to fit over panels (German: Ueberziehbleche)
and fit extremely poorly if you attempt a proper repair by removing the old
skin. Rust will spread even better under the new skin and eventually eat
through.

Especially with doglegs, I would stay away from these and get the complete
dogleg sections. For rocker panels these skins make more sense, since
removing the entire rocker is quite involving and most of the time it is
sufficient to cut out the bad sections and then use only parts of the repair
skins.

If you want to work with the skins on the dog legs, you have two options:
drill out the spot welds in the wheel arch and cut the old skin close to the
seam at the B-pillar and along the top edge. Then weld in new skin.
Alternatively, you could cut out the rust spots, treat the old skin and then
glue the replacement skin over the old one with one of these modern body
adhesives (I have not tried this yet, but this appears to be good
application for adhesives since it is mostly cosmetic and not structural).

I notice that you can buy the outter skin for dog legs for my 77, but in
looking at the originals, I'm wondering how you can remove just the outer
skin?? Same with  rocker panels? I'd love to see any sites that show this in
a step by step, especially the dog legs.
