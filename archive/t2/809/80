Subject: Re: [T2]Led Alarm Light

hey ronnie i am really more worried about all the tools i have got and honestly only ones i hold to my name are in the bus and really besides that i dont really have a hold on anything if they steal it but dont take my tools...
 
and seriously Grace(our bus) shes so bright surely someone would have better sense than try to steal the whole bus??? i hope so.. but dont put anything past anyone these days... they might just want to take her for a joy ride OHH my god what a awful thought....
 
you know they really do become part of the family.. dont they....? 
just the last week my seals broke on one of my windows and the bus flooded badly and as i stood inside at work absolutely not being able to get away from my job knowing that my bus was out there water pouring in... uuuuuugggggggghhhh it was awful...did all i could on break laying my good blankets down and all the rags i had.... wasnt nothing could be done... let it rain and pour was all that could be done and clean up afterwards... 
 
i am right now taking a break tonight from replacing the flooring in the bay area on the count of it... lucky thats all i got to replace.. and ohh that seal on the window it works now.. little jerry to it and its all better....
 
peace

Make sure you do something to disable your van. I work in Richmond VA and I've seen cars  with alarms going off while moving down the street. So don't count on just lights. Disconnect the battery or unplug the coil. I wouldn't do a fuel shut off. The carb bowl holds enough to get the van down the road. Go to Harbor Freight and get one of those wheel locks. They clamp onto the wheel and don't let it move. Not the steering wheel the rim.
