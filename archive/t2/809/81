I don't recall which wire it is.  Just turn the key off and test all the
unconnected wires with a test light or meter, looking for voltage.  I
don't know the history of my bus, so my switch might well be a replacement
as the "on when off" wire doesn't appear on the wiring diagram.  You could
make a similar function using a small relay that will turn the LED circuit
off when the ignition comes on.

Radio Shack carries ultra-bright LEDs that will work.  You also need to
buy a resistor to cut the current down.  There are LEDs with resistors
built in, but I don't know if RS carries them.

> maybe even a advance auto?/? etc,., not really sure have to call around tomorrow see what they even cost,....? would like to have it where i dont have another toggle switch in the bus if i can find the wire like you have george where it has power wehn bus is off...as soon as key turns off the light comes on...and blinks...

Don't know about auto parts stores.  Perhaps they might carry what you
want.  Make sure it is bright enough to see in daylight!
