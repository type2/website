Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus owner need help identifying part

From Zach Drew:

I recently purchased a 75' Riviera camper.  The previous owner did
major engine work and I am still trying to figure out all the things
that were done.  I need some help identifying a part that is rusted
and may be contributing to the gas smell in the cab as well as a
potential vacuum problem(possibly affecting brake servo operation?).
The haynes manual doesn't mention this part.  Pics are at
http://www.zachula.com/newgallery/bustek  .  The part with the hole
in it is attached to the exhaust which is then attached through the
wheel well up into the engine compartment which then attaches to
something on the fuel injection manifold(see sig for engine
details).  So if anyone can shed some light on the part that is
getting rusted through that would be appreciated.

Pic 1 is your EGR filter.

Is it giving you gas smell in the cab?  No, it will give you an exhaust leak and when you accelerate, you will
have a vacuum leak and a lean running engine.

A gasoline smell is a gas leak from the tank hoses or the FI hoses.
FIX THEM NOW!!!!!
