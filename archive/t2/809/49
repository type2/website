I believe that the EGR helps keeps head temps down...I think.. someone 
else can confirm.

Yeah, it will run lean, and it will make the engine run hotter.

Well, then you gotta look at when the egr valve is open.  It's closed at 
idle and full throttle.  Unless you like to press on the gas while 
you're braking, you won't be getting any air coming into your manifold 
during braking.

If you want, you can disable the egr valve by disconnecting it from the 
throttle valve.  However, who knows if the valve is even working 
correctly.  Usually, they tend to clog up, so it's kinda in your favor.

What you might want to do is first get a fire extinguisher, then start 
your car, then spray starter fluid at your hose junctions and see if you 
hear an increase in rpm.  If it goes up, you've found yourself a leak.
