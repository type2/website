Subject: Re: [T2] My 77 is a leaker.

<<NO, she does not have to remove the engine or the heads. 
What engine did YOU say you put hydraulics in??>>

74 1800.
I also had to do the heads & valves.
You sold me the rocker's & push rods for it
to convert it over to the oiler lifter's.

I gotta say that that pancake engine is the biggest pain ever to work
on.

Too much garbage to remove to get to the bottom line--the engine itself.

Who in God's name allowed the krauts to use flat bladed screw's for that
sheet metal? 
Whoever it was should be lined up against a wall and shot--dead, morto,
finito.
I had to use the impact driver on every one of them ( seemed like a
hunded of them.)
Then, you have to remember the exact order the sheet metal goes back on,
the aluminum shrouding too.
If you have temporary brain fade-forget it--start over.

I could have rebuilt three small blocks, put a clutch in a Mack, and had
some time left over to have lunch & a couple of beer's in the time it to
me to do the head's & lifter's on this engine.

Truely an excellent example of Kraut over engineering.

Doing the heads on my Vanagon wasn't no where near as tough.
