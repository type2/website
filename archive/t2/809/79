Look at the wiring loom coming out of the ignition switch. On my '71 I
found an unconnected wire that actually had voltage on it only when the
key was off! Perfect for the application you anticipate.

All you have to do is get a super-bright red LED with a dropping resistor
for 12V. Wire it between the hot terminal and ground and you'll be in
business. One LED will run continuously for many days without depleting
the battery excessively.

thanks george... you wouldnt happen to know what wire that is would you perhaps? or was it just a wire that someone else PO had there and ran from where i wonder.... ???

that sounds like what i am looking for....right there...

just something to keep the thought of just maybe in the thieves mind i hope and possibly save my belongings and bus from theft and possible vandalisim....

 

 

i guess i might be able pick one of those led lights up (-at-) possibly radio shack?? or electronics store....?

maybe even a advance auto?/? etc,., not really sure have to call around tomorrow see what they even cost,....? would like to have it where i dont have another toggle switch in the bus if i can find the wire like you have george where it has power wehn bus is off...as soon as key turns off the light comes on...and blinks...

 

 

again thanks
