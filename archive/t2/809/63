Subject: RE: [T2] How difficult is it to replace doglegs and rocker

I agree for most more or less flat body panels. But given the shape of the
doglegs creating flanges will be difficult and butt-welding pieces is an art
by itself.

Concerning Terry's post on foaming the rockers: I think that it should be
made very CLEAR that this a half-a**ed quickfix, not proper body work (even
if it is a 3M bodyshop product) - only good for cosmetics, but not for
structural integrity. Right there with JB-welding heads or Gex rebuilds.

I think you will get a better result if you cut out the bad skin, flange the
edges, and cut a piece from the new skin to fit. This will give you a flush
fit. Seam sealer could then be used to smooth the edges if you don't want to
weld and grind.
