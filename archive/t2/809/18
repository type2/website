Subject: How difficult is it to replace doglegs and rocker panels?

I notice that you can buy the outter skin for dog legs for my 77, but in
looking at the originals, I'm wondering how you can remove just the outer
skin?? Same with  rocker panels? I'd love to see any sites that show this in
a step by step, especially the dog legs.

Thanks,

Courtney
