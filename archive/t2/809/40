Subject: New Bus owner need help identifying part

Hello all,
      I recently purchased a 75' Riviera camper.  The previous owner did
major engine work and I am still trying to figure out all the things
that were done.  I need some help identifying a part that is rusted
and may be contributing to the gas smell in the cab as well as a
potential vacuum problem(possibly affecting brake servo operation?).
 The haynes manual doesn't mention this part.  Pics are at
http://www.zachula.com/newgallery/bustek  .  The part with the hole
in it is attached to the exhaust which is then attached through the
wheel well up into the engine compartment which then attaches to
something on the fuel injection manifold(see sig for engine
details).  So if anyone can shed some light on the part that is
getting rusted through that would be appreciated.

On an quasi-related sidenote, I am not planning a full resto but more of a
resto/upgrade as I plan to use this for camping.  Is there a "laundry
list" of things I should be aware of as a new bus owner and or a list of
things that should be replaced?  My fuel lines are all the braided cloth
type, should I replace these?  I am planning a complete electrical rebuild
as I plan on adding solar and 110 capabilities.  Thanks in advance for any
info.
