Subject: Re: [T2] Speeding ticket in 75 bus........South Caroninian

I'd be pretty reluctant to make any admissions in the land of mandatory 
minimum sentences .. sure it might be refreshing for a judge to hear: "yeah, 
I did it, I'm sorry, and I won't do it again" but if there is a mandatory 
minimum sentence .. no matter how refreshed the judge may be he may lack the 
discretion to do what he thinks is right ...

I think I would 1) get the best lawyer I could afford .. or 2) I'd look 
around for one of those organizations that strictly defends driving and 
ticket offences - in Ontario we have Points .. but there are these guys:
