Starting in 1978 (IIRC) the passenger busses came with sliders.
They're just a window, split in the middle, that allows the front half
to be slid backwards.

I swapped out my jalousie windows in my 73 for sliders and never
regretted it. They look better and are much quieter (though rebuilt
jalousies are pretty sweet.)
