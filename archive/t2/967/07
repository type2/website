Subject: papery stuff

Anyone have any experience reapplying the wall paper like stuff that goes, for
example, under the upper bunk .. or in a bunch of places in a Vanagon? I know
there are alternatives .. for example I know a guy who removed the stuff and
painted .. looks great .. but I want to restore the wall paper like stuff.

TIA
