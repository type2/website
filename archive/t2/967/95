vacuum fluctuates a bit while the problem is occuring but I think result
rather than cause.

that would/could be a problem on the early 003 tranny but I have the later
010 non vacuum tranny so there is no vacuum lines or connections to the
tranny

it's that huge drop (several hundred RPM)when I shift into gear that makes
me suspicious, never did that before and shouldn't do it now, RPM drop is
supposed to be less than 100rpm.  wonder if it is just the torque
convertor even, but why would it drop off at speed??  engine and tranny
input speeds appear to be the same.  no engine racing while bus
is crawling signs of slipage
