Subject: Friday - Buses are just that cool

So I opened up IE7 today to test a webpage and www.msn.com has an
article entitled the art of the road trip. What is the picture they
decide to use? A limegreen westy with a man playing guitar perched on
top. You have to wait for the flash movie to go to the next frame.

Buses define a good time ;)

Happy Friday,
