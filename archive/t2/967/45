Subject: Side Sliders?

I have decided to get rid of my jalousies and get sliders in my 1977 Wasty, OK, but I am not sure I have ever seen sliders.

I have started checking out every Bay I pass that doesn't have jalousies and I see a long window with a vent window at the end.

Is this what people call a slider?  What kind of Bay did sliders come in?

I have a Scout Traveler and I love leaving my 2 Great Danes in the store parking lot with there heads poking out the sliders, I want to do the same with my bus.

Thank you,
