I haven't done exactly that, but just yesterday I was at the U-Pull- 
It on
SE Foster (in Portland, OR for the non-locals) and scored a passenger
seat from a '75 (for *my* '75) that has fresh upholstery and seat heater
elements installed.  Would've gotten the driver side too, but someone
had already stripped the pads out of that one.

Looking at the tags on the wiring the heating elements are from Check
Corporation, which I haven't bothered to google yet...
