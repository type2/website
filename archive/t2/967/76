Subject: Remote starter location

I just picked up a simple remote starter. Directions say to plug the black
wire to a ground (got it) and the red wire to the starter's positive. Since
the starter has two positive power sources, which one, the main terminal or
the ignition terminals?

 

Just don't want to fry any thing.
