well I've now tried all the offered suggestions with absolutely no
results.  wish I had a spare AFM (anyone near Baltimore willing to lend me
a 78 AFM for 20 minutes??)  the things that really have me stumped are

it came on very slowly over about 150-200 miles...
and it seems to be flooding the engine when I try to make it accelerate.

???  mumble mumble mumble,

Bob
