Subject: Speeding ticket in 75 bus........South Caroninian advice

I'm not from the South, but... I have been caught speeding a couple of times. 
Usually I can get away with a lesser charge. Most officers do! So I am surprised. 

As for court, my court experience is simple. 1) Admit you are wrong and the judge will probably sigh in relief. Can you imagine how much BS comes across their ears. 

2) Apologize for doing wrong. (again, it's not something they hear often)

3) Then, after that offer a reason, not an excuse, a reason. In my bus, I have a tiny motor, and I need to get up to speed long before the merge lane to be able to merge safely. This may also be the case with Nyssa. New cars can go from 55 to 65 or 75 pretty quick, but our old busses need time. When you're merging onto a highway, the safest place to get up to speed is BEFORE you merge. 

Anyway, honesty goes a long way when a judge has heard all the excuses. 

Good luck!
