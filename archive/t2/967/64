Subject: Re: [T2] Friday, starts out Volvo and turns VW

We had a 240 wagon that got us through her college years, we wanted a universal car to share that could do everything we needed, it passed away at Donner Pass August 2006 on a round trip to the Bonneville Salt Flats, brings a tear, I sold it for 250 bucks and drove a rental car home.

While we loved that car for many reasons, it wasn't cute enough in my wifes opinion, and she didn't want to drive a wagon every day.

At the time that we bought the 240 wagon, I did research for our single universal car and gave my wife a choice between a Vanagon and a 240 wagon, at the time she said "I am not driving a minivan" and we got the wagon.

After college we needed two cars again, she wanted a car and I still wanted a Vanagon.

She said she would agree to a bus if it was a bay window because it had character and she promised to never say minivan again, after her first bay test drive she was totally in love, when we found the bus we bought she blurted out that we would take it before discussing it because she was so excited.

Well, she kept driving the 240 wagon with great plans to sell it and buy a car, and it forced the sale, and now she is finally getting her car.
