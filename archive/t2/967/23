Subject: Re: [T2] Cold Start Valve wiring...

Jon said:


 We did run into one snag, the motor starts only briefly. The PO cut the wires to the cold-start valve and
this shouldn't be a big deal, BUT all three of the wires are white.

There are three white wires coming out of the harness and only two wires to the Cold-Start plug. It looks like
a plug replacement gone bad.

 Question:

Is there a way to test all three wires as to how they connect? I think I may have something wired something
backward and want to rule it out completely.

I have scrutinized the diagrams and my brain is starting to simmer.

Only the O2 sensor wire on a 79 Calif bus is green. All the FI wires are white with a circuit code number
barely visable on the white.

Best test I have seen is in the 80-85 Vanagon Bentley. Page 24.15
You will need an ohmmeter/voltmeter.

Here is a website: http://manuals.type4.org/ljet/  with some troubleshooting help.
