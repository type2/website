He either didn't know the law or he was BSing you.  The minimum speed on the freeways is 40 MPH.  I suspect he was hoping to find a marijuana smell.  Cheers...KR

I'll bet you that I am the only person you have ever
known who has gotten pulled over, not ONCE, but TWICE
for driving too SLOW in my bus!
The first one was on my way to High Country 2002 when
a Boone County kentucky sherriff pulled me over "Boy,
is there anything wrong with that van of yers?!?!"
"No sir,hot day, unknown engine, taking it easy, etc."
The second was on my way back from Bonnaroo by a
Tennessee State Trooper, this was a fun one "Boy, you
know Tennessee state law requires that you go cannot
go more less 20 miles per hour under than the maximum
posted Speed Limit? The speed limit here is 70 and I
clocked you at 47!!!"   "How the hell can I know
that?!?! I am from OHIO and its NOT posted!!!" .... He
thought I should know anyway.....
Both were just shaking me down and fishing for some
sort of bigger bust of drugs or something...Sorry to
disappoint, just a middle-aged normal guy with his
family!!
P.S.  I am not a huge fan of our friendly Peace
Officers!
