Richard Atwell said....."I've been looking for this brass ring terminal for
the battery terminal:

The original AMP terminal had one built in and It let's you quickly  
connect an accessory.

Does anyone know of a vendor that sells this ring terminal? You'd  
think it was pretty common but I can't find it anywhere.

I'm not interested in a replacement cable with the accessory wire  
already attached."

Let me make 2 suggestions.  First, it would be easy enough to make a tab
like that from a small piece of brass or copper stock that are commonly sold
at hobby shops or McMaster-Carr.  The second suggestion is for the
non-purists in our midst and is an alternative I have used and so I know it
works.  On the positive terminal of my battery I have a battery terminal
connector that has a threaded stud at the end.  I replaced my + battery
cable with one that has a large ring terminal swaged on.  The ring terminal
goes over the stud and then you tighten it down with a wing nut.  Then when
you want to add connections to the battery + terminal just make sure the
wire has a large ring terminal on it to put under the wing nut.

Here's what it looks like
