Subject: Re: [T2] Any list member in Juneau?

I spent a summer going in and out of there on a cruise ship.  Juneau is a really small town to be a state capitol.  The people are very friendly, the food is great (best Salmon bakes in the world), and the scenery unbelievable.  They have bald eagles like we have pigeons.  They're everywhere.  But on the downside, property is expensive, most things are much more expensive than down here, and it's cold.  Damned cold!  In Alaska, it's even cold in the summer.  Especially Scagway where the wind is always blowing about 50 MPH.  Good luck, though.  I don't remember seeing any T2's.  Cheers...KR

thinking/planning a move to Juneau coming up in a
couple of months and I don't know a soul there.

Anyone help would be great!
