Subject: pulseing battery light

Goethe is running fairly well, though, acceleration on any type of
incline seems kinda sluggish.  think i'll check the vacuum can on the
dizzy.  and the fuel filter. strange happenings on the steering
column.  when i put on the left turn signal there are no problems.
occasionally when i put on the right blinker it stutters a bit and the
battery light pulses dimly.  check the connections in the engine
compartment.  they all check out fine.  i am pretty sure the ignition
switch is going as i must turn it back from start to run manually,
sometimes accidentally shutting the bus off.  think i will put in a
new ignition switch, at least the electrical part.  should i also
change out the lock cylinder?  and if so should i buy the hella mexico
or the brazil?

thanks,

jeremiah
