I've been doubting it but since it will only do anything abnormal when in
gear it is beginning to nag at me.......

pretty sure none of the above.

I've begun to reach the "Guess" stage now,  in neutral or park will rev
fine will accel normal.

as soon as I shift into any gear 1,2,D,R rpm's drop way off almost to
stalling.  many hundred rpms.
acceleration sucks if try to push peddal to floor will lug to stalling
if accelerator is nursed it will go but response is way off.
and gas mileage coming back from everybus was way off, felt like I was
driving uphill all the way home.  near the end, very steep uphill. had to
keep it in 2nd to make anyheadway. but engine speed was "Correct" for
vehicle speed no apparent slipage.

one way clutch has made some noise on start for years but it sounds and
feels no different.

other than that there is no sounds or "feel" of anything different in
tranny and the fluid doesn't smell burnt.

problems "Feel" engine but tranny is/has been suspect but MAJOR job
especially alone to do an auto tranny swap just to check.  I have spare
tranny and torque convertor, seals etc so it is not a part problem, just
major big time work "just to check"

I'm rambling, spent a week and all I have is frustration...

thanks
Bob
