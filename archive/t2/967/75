Subject: VW mini-show, sale  in Fresno TODAY

A reminder, Sebring West, a Fresno FLVWAPS, is hosting their annual customer appreciation sale and show. They usually have hot dogs, drinks and discount prices on new and salvaged parts. Friday, 4/20 from 3 p.m. to 7 or so, North east of the McKinley/Blackstone intersection. 

Karl says there's a bay bus modified into a flatbed truck with excellent workmanship. For sale.
