Subject: Dial Indicator

Picked this up at horrible freight today. It's on sale for $20 this
weekend. Even if I determine the indicator itself is a piece of crap I
think the cool mount is worth the price:

It's a flexible tube with a cable inside. You get the tube in the
position you want and tighten the cam down by the visegrips and the
thing keeps its shape. I've got a typical magnetic mount I picked up
at a swap meet but this just seems more useful to me.
