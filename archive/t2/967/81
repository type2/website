Hi James,

I used a 12V seat heater this winter in the westfakia on the way to  
the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout... it kept my butt toasty warm.  
The one I used was a seat pad that was bought at Canadian Tire for  
about $20 or so.

For some reason I forgot to take it to EveryBus last weekend. DUMB  
MOVE on my part. Crossing the Allegheny and Blue Ridge mountain  
ranges we had wind and snow, both on the way down and on the way back.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
