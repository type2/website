Hi Volks,

One other way to implement WI in an FI engine is to use Megasquirt  
Fuel injection.

The MS system can be programmed to handle two sets of injectors...  
one set can be set up for gasoline and the other set to supply water/ 
ethanol when needed.  If I were building a MS setup (Which I plan  
to... Someday) I would use the existing cold-start injector since it  
is already available and normally isn't used by MS.  It would require  
a secondary fuel pump, but it wouldn't have to be an expensive high  
pressure pump if you mapped the circuits to keep the CS valve open  
longer...

For the time being I have a few other projects to keep me busy. But  
if I can find the time, I can see the advantages of adding WI to the  
L-Jetronic FI on my westfakia in time for the crossing of the  
Allegheny and Blue Ridge Mountain ranges when High Country Bus  
Festival comes along in late July.


Happy Trails,

((Burning off Grand Ams at the lights?  Robt, please share the recipe  
for whatever you're smoking!!))
