Subject: Re: [T2] Remote starter location

If you have a two-wire remote starter switch, NOTHING
goes to ground! In my album, TechPix2, toward the end
there are starter and solenoid pix. There is a
description and photo that shows where to hook up your
remote. Link in my sig. - BaH
I just picked up a simple remote starter. Directions
say to plug the black
wire to a ground (got it) and the red wire to the
starter's positive. Since
the starter has two positive power sources, which
one, the main terminal or
the ignition terminals?
