Subject: Friday, starts out Volvo and turns VW

We added a new member to our family, we bought a Volvo 164E for 700 bucks from an online auction, item number 170101384679

My wife finished college, did the lame job for experience, and 3 weeks ago started a real job, for the last year we have been looking for her car.

We are taking the train from Portland to Tacoma to get it in the morning and then heading up to hang out with a friend in Seattle, the guy that introduced me to Volvos, should be awesome fun, and on Monday it will go in the shop for an inspection and tune up, and either a tranny service or rebuild, it slips in reverse.

I jumped on the website for IPD, which is just down the street from where I work, to see what they sell for this particular car and came across something interesting.

Besides Volvo parts IPD sells things that can be used with any car that are very interesting, and they have a do-it-yourself heated seats kit.

I have made fun of heated seats many times in my life, even though I did have them before I swore off car payments for life, but that was before I bought my bus, I plan to do this when I recover my front seats.

I wonder if I could just get some out of seats at U-Pull-It.
