Subject: T1 Doghouse Heater Snorkel Plugging

Greetings -

I'm building a 1915 T1 with a doghouse. I'll be running J-tubes, so a plugging of the heater snorkels is in order. I am sure most will recall Jake Raby's findings, as are well published to the likes of TheSamba. Basically, Jake found that plugging the snorkels raised the #3 head temp by 35F and lowered #1 by 15F. The bottom line was (if not using the heater boxes) to drill a hole in the plug so that turbulance wouldn't build up inside the shroud, to the detriment of #3.

I took some time to observe my shroud with this in mind, and have come up with a hair-brained idea I wanted to pass by you good folks. After much deliberation, I decided that a 1.5" (or larger) hole here:

pics 227, 228, and 233 would:

1) relieve the beginning of that tunnel (located at 10 o'clock on the shroud) from creating an air flow distrubance.
2) allow a fairly free flow of cooling air through the tunnel, onto #3 (no waste)

You can peruse the other pics to get an idea of where the internal tunnels start, etc...

Thought?
