Subject: Cold Start Valve wiring...

So Chris (of BustedBus fame) and I spent most of this weekend and week
getting my 78 Westy roadworthy. We were very patient with all the vacuum
lines, fuel lines and electrical.

We did run into one snag, the motor starts only briefly. The PO cut the
wires to the cold-start valve and this shouldn't be a big deal, BUT all
three of the wires are white.

 

There are three white wires coming out of the harness and only two wires to
the Cold-Start plug. It looks like a plug replacement gone bad.

 

Question:

Is there a way to test all three wires as to how they connect? I think I may
have something wired something backward and want to rule it out completely.

 

I have scrutinized the diagrams and my brain is starting to simmer.

Thanks,
