Looks like a pretty recent paint job. Looks like they drove through the
hailstorm; Roof looks pretty good, but lots of dings on the nose. Not too
sure what's under that ragtop. That's definitely not a pro job.
Curious that they list the actual cash value as $10,000, and it is owned by
State Farm Insurance. I wonder if that's what the insurance co. paid the
owner? That would be the REAL cash value, IMHO. I guess mine must be worth
at least $17,000 then, as it's in better shape and has no hail damage. Maybe
I should switch to State Farm....

BTW, it's in Phoenix, and the current bid is $1750, with a hammer date of
12/27.
