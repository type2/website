Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Pricing Question

Mike in WV I would have given $1000-1500+ for that bus if truely mostly rust
free.  T4 engines aren't that hard to find, even today.  If tranny is still
there and everything is intact, body condition is paramount in the rust belt. 
Conversely, you could nickel and dime yourself to death here, if you go
$1500-2000 optimisticly to get a good engine together and in, another
$250-300+ for canvas, then still have a ratty interior and who knows what else
to get in line (FI stuff, steering, who knows) then you should have looked in
the $3000-5000 price range in the first place for something running and solid
that you actually drove.  I've made some money over the years buying blown
engine/tranny buses, fixing what ails them, and selling them for meager to
good profits depending on the work/circumstances but it presumes a good
knowledge of them a good parts inventory in your garage/basement, else
sometimes better to spend a bit more and get less of a
 project.  And I'm never one to pass up the proverbial $1000 car.  Another
flip however, even worst case if you got a place to sit it, an understanding
SO, you could always part it for more than $500.

I've got the opportunity to buy a '78 Westy. Body has no dents and very sparse
rust. The top is in good shape, but probably needs new canvas. Glass is good.
Interior is original and all there, but needs a fair amount of work on the
cabinetry. Apholstery is fair. Outside lights are good. It has no engine, but
harness is intact. Tires are worn, with no uneven wear, and hubcaps are
undented and rust free. I don't know what else to include in this. I'd
appreciate any input on whether it is worth $500.
