Subject: Why not???!!

I am prolly 'breaking a lot of rules' here, but I was just 'surfing' a site
called www.copart.com , and there is a beautiful '73 VW Combi, which seems to
have no damage other than superficial paint damage from hail, and it looks
like a 'diamond in the rough'!  The # to see it is...#23437660, and I believe
it is in California, but it is sooo sweet, thought I would trade umbrage for
succor, and hope some one from list might 'rescue' it!  Merry Xmas.
Cheers
Squid
