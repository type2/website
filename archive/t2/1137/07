Subject: H4 Headlights

Greetings Volks!

I installed one of my new H4 headlights last night on my 1971,  intending 
to install the light as much as verify that I had burned out the stock
light as opposed to it being an electrical gremin (it was a burnt out
light).

First and foremost: man were the small screws that hold the chrome 
bulb-holder-bit deteriorated.  Even with PB Blast, they pretty much
stripped as soon as I put a screwdriver on them.  Luckily the vice 
grips did the trick and freed them up.

Second: Is the H4 glass headlight housing a bit smaller than the EOM bulb?
I ask because while the housing fits perfectly in the chrome peice
which holds it in, the outer chrome flashing peice had a gap between
it and the bulb, where it does not with the stock.  Examining the
two side by side, the H4 looks *slightly* smaller, but maybe I'm 
fooling myself.  Does this make sense?  Do I merely need to reorient the
bulb-housing to get everything lined up properly?

And lastly, my high beams aren't working.  I just replaced the relay
but it didn't change anything.  When I acutate the high-bean switch
there is no click and nothing happens.  Any thoughts?

Happy Friday!

Cheers, 
   Tom
