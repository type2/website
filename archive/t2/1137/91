Subject: World record CV boot change??

OK, I had removed the axle before, but hadn't gotten around to replacing the
boots. From start to finish it took me about 55 minutes to take off a snap
ring, tap off the one CV joint (was an easy tap off, not like the other axle;
probably why it was so fast to do) ;-) slide off the old CV boots, clean up
the CV joints, replace the boots, add grease, and put a plastic bag over each
end in prep for re-attaching to the bus. How was that?
Can I join the Type2 pit crew now?? :-)

Always be yourself, because the people that matter don't mind,
and the ones who mind, don't matter.
