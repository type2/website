The cover plate under the pedal linkages (under being under) of my 77 camper 
fell off (literally fell off - on a freeway - due to trusting a mechanic to do 
something I shoulda done!!!) - it was a HUGE vector for cold air to freeze our 
boots off in the winter.  

It was also darn hard to find a replacement for this pan.  When I did I adhesed 
a piece of that thin reflective insulation to the inside of it, and it seemed to 
stop the freeze-o-matic response of the bus in the winter.
