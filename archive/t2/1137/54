Hi Josh,

On my 79:
I have, with reasonable success, filled in some gaps in my weather stripping
by using different sizes of foam door weatherstripping (and
example: hhttp://
www.homedepot.com/Tools-Hardware-Hardware-Fasteners-Weather-Stripping/h_d1/N-5yc1vZ1xgsZard7/R-202262324/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053
).

On a couple spots, I was able to stick it directly to the Bus
weatherstripping, so it is not as noticeable. For the front door top
corners, it stuck better to the metal.

For the dash fresh air vents, I have cut cardboard to the size of the black
bugscreen behind the front grill, spray-painted it with a couple heavy coats
of paint to semi-waterproof it, removed the screen and used the cardboard in
place of the screen to block the front grill on the inside, and or removed
the fresh air duct covers inside, under the dash (where the "ambulance fans
would be mounted), and stuffed them with sandwich bags stuffed with old
socks/ rags, then replaced the covers, and they are out of sight. These are
easily removable mods and won't soak up moisture and cause rust (well, the
cardboard can get squishy if I get alot of rain, but it's an easy
replacement).

Good luck man! mike
