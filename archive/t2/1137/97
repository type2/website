I am fighting State Farm right now and they say mine is worth $4400 but want
$1100 to sell it back to me.

I will be switching automotive insurance companies when this is over.

I would call my interaction with the claim adjuster harassment, they lied to
me several times and had to admit to it when I didn't just cave to what they
were telling me.  They didn't know what a Westfalia was or how to spell it
and days later told me they were experts in the VW bus culture.  They were
definitely one of the rudest people I have ever dealt with.  I asked to get
a new claims adjuster and was ignored which IMO is enough of a reason to
drop SF.  The claim adjuster never passed any of my vehicle's information
over to the appraiser they used and even now when the appraiser I hired has
been in negotiation with them they are surprised to find things out about my
vehicle.  I suspect that the Claim Adjuster was working in a way and using
tactics that State Farm's management supports.
