Believe it or not, I did check the weather in Tasmania before I 
replied.  According to tripadvisor.com,
the average maximum summer temperature is 22-24 degrees C (72-76 degrees 
F).  That tells me that if Tasmania sees 30-35C in the summer, it is a 
rare occurrence.  That is quite different from the average maximum 
summer temperature in, say Phoenix AZ USA which is 40C (105 degrees F)  
That's the average high temp over an entire month!.  If A/C is "not 
realistic" in 40+C weather, my suggestion (to anyone!) would be to drive 
a different vehicle until the weather cools off rather than spend money 
installing window film that will not make a significant difference.  
Think about it - in 40C weather who in their right mind is going to have 
the windows up anyway?  The front windows will be rolled down, the spray 
bottle will be spraying and any tinted  (fixed) windows in the rear of 
the bus are pretty much irrelevant, aren't they?  I assume nobody is 
riding in the back in that kind of heat.  If you have driven your bus to 
Central Australia, you might know this already - have you?  I lived in 
Las Vegas, NV (average maximum summer temp 41C/107F) for a summer.  I 
tinted my windows while I was there.  It didn't help keep me cool.  Did 
make the bus look nicer though, and protected the interior somewhat.  I 
currently live in Dallas, Tx. where the average maximum summer 
temperature is 36C/96F.  Still pretty hot.

In any case, I believe that A/C IS realistic on a late Baywindow.  I 
have done it, it works and it is not expensive if you are willing to put 
some time and effort into it.  Every time this subject comes up, the 
vast majority of the replies come from people who believe that a) the 
engine can't handle it or b) it's too expensive or c) it's just plain 
unnecessary.  Most (maybe all) of these people have never tried it 
and/or live in cooler climates where c) may indeed be true.  Because of 
this I tend to get a bit excited about this subject, please don't take 
it personally.
