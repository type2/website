Thanks for sharing this. I didn't pick it up either.

Curious she got the bus back. Last I heard it belonged to Allstate
since they paid the claim, and they planned to auction it and give the
proceeds to charity so as not to be accused of taking advantage of the
appreciation in value.

Maybe they just let her return the settlement amount she received.
