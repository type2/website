They still make and sell a current version of a transporter, don't
they? I see them around, and if I wanted a modern minivan I would
consider one. But I prefer the old classic version, one which I cannot
imagine possible to make and sell in this country, as it is. We can't
even get the watercooled Brazilian version, although Britain can. I
think it is telling that the article mentions that VW now rebadges a
Chrysler and sells it as if it were their own...

This pipedream at least looks like it has a family resemblance to a
real Type 2! Again, though, I cannot imagine VW would go through all
the tooling etc to make something that anyone wealthy enough to afford
could already have made almost good as new from a *real*
transporter...
