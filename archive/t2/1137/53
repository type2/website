Subject: Mind the Gap (weather sealing)

It's very cold in my part of England.

Even my Propex doesn't do much when my Late Bay bus is in motion.

I can see daylight along the front of my sliding door when closed.
Some cold air still comes through the dash vents even though the blue lever is 
all the way up.
I realized that the seals on all the doors and ventilation ducts are really not 
up to task.

I'm going to try some of the improvements from the Type 2 Library here:
http://www.type2.com/library/heating/chpheat.htm

That article suggests using silicone sealant, but that seems messy.  Any other 
suggestions for plugging the gaps in the door seals?
Also, there is some cold air coming through the front door vents (the ones down 
by the front seats).  Are the intakes for these vents the holes on the front 
edge of the doors?

Any other tips for sealing up the bus are appreciated.

Thanks,

Josh
