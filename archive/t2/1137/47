That's a good point.  This conversion could be deemed illegal if the 
state where the bus resides has smog inspections.  In California, for 
example, you are not allowed to make any changes to your fuel system, 
which means a carb is a no-go, even if you're able to tune it to run 
better than stock.  They like the fact that the EFI system is a black 
box and you "can't" make any changes to it.  That doesn't mean that 
people don't get around it one way or another, but it can't be as 
obvious as a carb...
