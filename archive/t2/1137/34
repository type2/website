Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Brake Drum Confusion

211 501 615 B's were unique to Brazilian manufactured Buses.  These
drums were sort of a combination of the D (62-63 M216), E (64-67), F
(Early 1968) and the G (Late 68-70).  They actually fit and worked ok
on the 64-67 Bus and *kinda* fit on the 68-70 Bus.  A real bastard of
a drum to put it plainly.  It could get ya down the road, but I would
never use them as a permanent replacement.  Whenever I received them I
always returned them to the supplier.

Drum numbers and their year applications as per OE German specs:

211 501 615 A - Bus Mar 55-Aug 63
211 501 615 D - Bus 62-63 w/Big Axle Redux Boxes & Brakes (M216)
211 501 615 E - Bus 64-67
211 501 615 F - Bus Early 68 (to 2x8 109 283) (RAREST of the Rare)
211 501 615 G - Bus Late 68-70 (fr 2x8 109 284)
