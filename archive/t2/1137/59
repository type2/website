Subject: Re. Mind the Gap (weather sealing)

Hi Josh,
          I use two or three layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil to cover the
front vent(s).  Easy to mould to fit directly over the outside vent opening(s)
or across the "grille".  Water proof, easy to remove and reuse next winter,
and doesn't rust.  I find it is best to block the entrance to the vent system,
as there always seem to be cold air leaks if you block inside the system after
that.

Also, look/feel up under the dash for "extra" holes.  Best done while
moving,.... have someone else drive ;)  On my bus there seem to be a few holes
that don't have any purpose currently, except to let in cold air.  Tape, or
silicone seal, pop-can patches over the holes until you find a use for them,
or decide on a permanent fix.  Cut down a great deal of cold air for me.

It's very cold in my part of England.
Also, there is some cold air coming through the front door vents (the ones
down
by the front seats).  Are the intakes for these vents the holes on the front
edge of the doors?

Any other tips for sealing up the bus are appreciated.

Thanks,

Josh
