I understand the math, what i don't get is how they are telling me it was
only worth $4400 before a logtruck t-boned it but somehow it is still worth
$1100 afterwards.

When I am selling it, it aint worth spit, when they are selling it, it is
worth its weight in gold.

This part doesn't surprise me and isn't why i am done with State Farm, lying
to me and trying to bully me is my problem with them.  Being told that
busses with different colored front doors are comparable to my bus because
having different colored front doors is a popular VW bus modification and is
considered an upgrade, and that they know this because they are experts in
VW culture, pisses me off.
