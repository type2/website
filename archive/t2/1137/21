Hi Bob,

Agreed, it looks much better than the earlier prototypes. The low front 
air intake is subtle, but effective and modern looking. Looks like a 
versatile vehicle for sure.

Can't say for certain that it's a rear-engine design though; it's all 
too similar to the verdier entry in the michelin contest concept in that 
regard.

Perhaps it could work if they distributed a hybrid drive system and 
batteries throughout the chassis?  That would be a winner for sure.

Happy Trails,
