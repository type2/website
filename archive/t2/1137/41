Subject: '78 Westy Pricing Question

I&#39;ve got the opportunity to buy a &#39;78 Westy. Body has no dents and very sparse rust. The top is in good shape, but probably needs new canvas. Glass is good. Interior is original and all there, but needs a fair amount of work on the cabinetry. Apholstery is fair. Outside lights are good. It has no engine, but harness is intact. Tires are worn, with no uneven wear, and hubcaps are undented and rust free. I don&#39;t know what else to include in this. I&#39;d appreciate any input on whether it is worth $500. 

Thanks,

-Mike
