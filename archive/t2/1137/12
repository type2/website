I'm  curious about Seafoam.

Has anyone used it in their air-cooled  VW?
Any hard data or anecdotal evidence is appreciated.

I've also  heard that some VW forums have frowned upon its usage.
Any details on that  would be great as well.

Thanks,

josh



hello Josh  I have used it for years in VWs and power boats and other  
equipment. I have not seen any other forums putting it down,   I use  it in all 
my stuff that gets stored over the winter, much better than  stabilt(sp) 
fuel stablizer, I also use Marvel mystery oil along with the  seafoam.  later
