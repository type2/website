The anti-rust packs (actually anti-oxidants - they have iron oxide in them,
which absorbs oxygen) work good.  Someone told me eventually they stop working
(don't know one way or the other); I don't know if they can be "reccharged"
like 
dessicant bags or if so how.

The dessicant bags I use are old Mil
Surplus - every few months, throw them in a 
250 degree (f) oven overnight,
and they're good to go for another few months.  
I've had the ones I use going
on prolly 10 years + now, and they work 
surprisingly well.  They're about the
size of one of those tall coffee cups, in 
a sewn up cloth bag with the
instructions how to recharge them printed on the 
front.I use one of these
pillowpacks in my gun cabinet,  a couple in the gun 
safe at home, and one in
my rollaround tool box; they seem to work excellent.

(BTW - that same
recharge method seems to work for other dessicant packs as 
well...  fyi!)
Even with all these precautions, I'd still check the area every so often to
make 
sure it wasn't starting to form a 

problem area"...  once it starts, as
they say, rust never sleeps.
