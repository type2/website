Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Pricing Question

I would say it is.  

Body work and rust are a bigger deal (IMHO) than engines.  Plus, you never know what you're getting with an existing engine: buying a new one removes those questions.

While others will chip in here, you can Expect to pay at least ~$2500 for a new engine (long block), plus more for the associated tinware, alternators, etc.  Do not buy from GEX.  It might be affordable to buy a used engine from someone just to get all the associated tinware.

Good luck!

Cheers,
   Tom

Interior is original and all there, but needs a fair amount of work on the cabinetry. Apholstery is fair. Outside lights are good. It has no engine, but harness is intact. Tires are worn, with no uneven wear, and hubcaps are undented and rust free. I don&#39;t know what else to include in this. I&#39;d appreciate any input on whether it is worth $500.
