Just remember that your paint should be in good shape, and wax that area
before using the magnet so it won't compound rusting.  You can get strips that
contain chemicals that will inhibit oxidation - they are made for tool-boxes
and other enclosed spaces.  Dessicant might work too, if the area is sealed
before it gets too humidified.
