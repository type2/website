Yeah, lacking the big bucks for the recommended CB Performance, Facet
has been my pump of choice on many buses. I use them with the Weber
progressive in sunny California with no trouble. Some report high-end
fuel starvation, but it was never a problem for me, and the Weber
would push the bus faster than I care to drive.
