A good hint for people that "wonder" about Seafoam or Marvel Mystery Oil etc, is to hunt for the MSDS which must be legally provided for almost anything used or manufactured by industry. I just did a search in Google for Seafoam, MSDS and got the above link in PDF format. 
Download this file, and you'll see what Seafoam is made up of. Mostly solvents and oils. The solvent would be good cleanup for hydraulic valves etc, when added to your oil. Probably clean out oil galleries a bit too. Probably better than adding a liter of ATF like the old cure for sticky hydraulics.
