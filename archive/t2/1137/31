Use this scenario to visualize/help remember;
If you are removing the positive battery terminal first and your wrench hits
the chassis, you will get a nice spark.

If the negative if removed first, the chassis is no longer grounded, so you
can short positive terminal to chassis with your fumbling wrench and nothing
will happen.  Very safe.

When installing battery hook up negative last.
