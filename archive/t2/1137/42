Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Pricing Question

it is probably worth $500

be prepared to put a couple thousand into it the first year.
you neeed a decent engine, 78 was fuel injected. a good rebuild is in the 
$2,000-3,000 range.  a running but unknown engine could probably be 
grabbed for $500 but get one for that model bus.

you need new tires,  almost for sure on used bus, probably has auto tires 
that are unsuitable.

replace all fuel lines !!!! no exceptions
check and replace brakes
probably will need battery.


> I&#39;ve got the opportunity to buy a &#39;78 Westy. Body has no dents 
and very sparse rust. The top is in good shape, but probably needs new canvas. Glass is good. Interior is original and all there, but needs a fair amount of work on the cabinetry. Apholstery is fair. Outside lights are good. It has no engine, but harness is intact. Tires are worn, with no uneven wear, and hubcaps are undented and rust free. I don&#39;t know what else to include in this. I&#39;d appreciate any input on whether it is worth $500.


sounds like you have a good foundation.
