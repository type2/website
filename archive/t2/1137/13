Subject: Re: [T2] Seafoam

Josh, I use their trans product in auto trannies and have for years, as a
latch ditch before rebuild (it is just a cleaner not a seal conditioner) and a
PM to a vehicle I have just bought before I do a fluid change.  There is an
interesting web site out their that claims their engine and tranny products
are just a mixture of like alcohol, kerosene, naptha and oil or something
along those lines, but I don't care, I've had OK luck with the tranny stuff. 
Never used the engine product unfortunately but the the tranny one has
improved a number auto trannies from VW to 3/4 ton Chevy for me over the
years.  Unlike Mark though I'm a firm believer in Stabil for winter storage,
even with modern high ethanol gas, and have been for decades so YMMV as with
everything.  I figure the engine product I'd consider using on something with
noisy hydraulic lifters as a temp "fix" for cleaning those.  Unlike most
wonder products I don't think Seafoam will hurt anything
 by gumming stuff up, probably just solvent any way you cut it, but  I don't
know it will help things much either.

I've also heard that some VW forums have frowned upon its usage.
Any details on that would be great as well.
