Subject: Re: [T2] Mind the Gap (weather sealing)

I second Bob but am a little less exotic.  When I drove my '78, 90 miles
commuting daily in 0-10F temps, I took the simpler approach, pull the grill
and simply either cover the mesh with duct tape (messy later, but if you got a
spare to swap in seasonally just fine) or simply take a bit of black/clear
plastic sheeting, and place under the grille, reattach grille, cut plastic to
fit carefully with razor blade.  And working the seals on the flappers a bit
with some silicone lube (not sealant) can restore them quite a bit sometimes,
though probably less so today, as can careful closed adjustment.  For the
sliding door, a new good seal should fit, if it doesn't work on it, if old
again work in some silicone lube.  For the front door slat seals (blue
sliders) the slider is usually pretty good tight seal, the more likely issue
is missing plastic weatherseal sheet behind the door panel (restore again with
visqueen/plastic sheet/whatever you call it over
 there) and/or combined with warped door cards that no longer seal down well,
for those I've had good luck with thin self adhesive foam weatherstrip along
the line of door clips, applied to the door side, and around the frame of the
sliding slat, but fairly thin, or better thick closed cell (1cm or so thick)
but with a lot of crush to nearly nothing (what in the US in a home store is
the cheaper foam.)
 
Final thought as always, if a pop top, there is your real heat loss, jam 6" of
foam sofa cushion material in the hole till spring.  And of course as long
mentioned, recirculating heater, but with a Propex, you have that already.
