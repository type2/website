Subject: Rear Brake Drum Confusion

Anyone have a clue what bus this rear brake drum fits?

Herebs my story.  Some five or six years ago I ordered a replacement rear
drum for my 1970 bay.  The drum came, Frum, of Brazilian manufacture.  I
didnbt read the part number stamped on it. I just put it on my bus. But it
never quite worked right.  It rubbed against the backing plate and I never
seemed to be able to get it tight enough on the splines so that there wasnbt
an occasional bit of thump-thump-thumpy noise on the road, a problem that got
worse with time.  Only when I replaced it today did I read the part number.
211501615B.  Not 211501615G.

I have not been able to link this part number to any bus, though a google
search turns up other incidents of folks having these drums and not knowing
quite what they are for.

Any thoughts?
