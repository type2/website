this message series raises a question for me, Under the front grill flaps,
what kind of foam do you use and what are the dimensions for that foam to help
seal those flaps?  Every bus I've done and tried 3/8 +/- inch closed cell foam
still leaked air at speed!

 When I drove my '78, 90 miles
commuting daily in 0-10F temps, I took the simpler approach, pull the grill
and simply either cover the mesh with duct tape (messy later, but if you got
a
spare to swap in seasonally just fine) or simply take a bit of black/clear
plastic sheeting, and place under the grille, reattach grille, cut plastic to
fit carefully with razor blade.
