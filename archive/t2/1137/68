Hi Peter:

Was this one of yours?

for all:  If you smell gas, stop driving it.  Look for the leak.  If you can't fix it roadside tow it home.  Srop the engine and look at ALL lines.  My Green Bean almost ended up like that.  I though I had the lines good fixing the leakers I could find, but when I dropped the engine this Spring, found rotted linesi couldn't see while engine was in.

But hey, what about the magnesium?  We don't have THAT in the engine compartment....
