I don't think you mentioned all the symptoms,, but you do have a good handle 
on things...

which is probably correct..... and you should see that other things will 
work too....  If your loosing power to the ignition coil at the fuse 
panel..or before the fuse panel....then you don't have a horn,, or brakes 
lights, or windsheild wipers, dash light for gen, dash light for turn 
signal, and maybe the light in the eflasher,, or the eflashers might not 
work,,, or the carb idle solenoid and choke
...
you can do this trouble shooting easier at the fuse panel. Don't take it 
apart quite yet...

Sure,, but when you did your jumper from the regulator to the coil,, and got 
it to start.... did the dash lights work?
When you put the jumper from the  regulator to the coil.. it should have 
back fed the fuse panel along the coil wire... and all the stuff I listed 
above should have worked again..
If not,, then the coil wire it the suspect....

sort of starting from the top....
IF your loosing power to the ignition coil at the fuse panel..or before the 
fuse panel...like the ignition switch is faulty...then you don't have a 
horn,, or brakes lights, or windsheild wipers, dash light for gen, dash 
light for turn signal, and maybe the light in the eflasher,, or the 
eflashers might not work,,, or the carb idle solenoid and choke

In your case,,, a jumper [road side jumper can be a paper clip / hair pin / 
thumbtac as the clips are 3mm apart] installed in between fuse 3 lower clip 
to fuse 2 lower clip will jumper power from the battery via the headlight 
switch to all the above mentioned items

If I assumed wrong.. and the original situation is.. If all the above 
mentioned items *do* work..... and you still don't have power at the coil.. 
then you need to look along the coil wire for a break... [open circuit] 
there should be no power at the carb idle solenoid and choke as well

It may be at the lower fuse clip #3 behind the panel... you have to slip it 
away from the mounting at this poing...or anywhere along that wire,, not the 
fuse,, as there is NO FUSE in the coil circuit.  There is a connection at 
the back of the fuse panel off the unfused buss for fuse 3,4,5
 I would guess under the dash or in the engine compartment,, not in the wire 
loom under the bus... but you never know.

I have seen other problems.. usually the installation of a sTeReo that 
caused wires to burn... sometimes burning thru and creating open circuits,, 
sometimes shorting them so you can't turn the ignition off... and not always 
right at the time of the original problem... look for wire insulation that 
is melted  and give that wire a pull,, to see if there is a break in the 
copper inside...

The power coming off the lower fuse clip 1-5 is NOT FUSED,, the power that 
goes to the ignition coil is NOT FUSED.. so if a short happens at that coil 
wire,, it has a tendency to melt,, smoke,, turn red in the face... and other 
assorted things .... that do not always mean terminal... it can completely 
fail later in life.

for example,, the carb idle solenoid and choke is on that same wire,,.and 
can easily be touched to ground
