Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Manifold Torque Values

The head did not fail, it was the spark plug hole that got stripped out.
So, I took it all apart to take to the machinist to get drilled out.  In
looking at the head, the exhaust had two tack welds on each exhaust and two
of them were broken on one tube.  In the "better safe than sorry" and "do it
now for cheap while the engine is out instead of later for $$" method I had
tubes welded on with better welds.  Plus the one that had the broken weld,
the part that butted up to the had actually came off.

When the exhaust was taken off, there were none anyway.

I had bought a gasket kit that had everything and everyone. They were there

and I did not use them. Aarrggghh. It's all in the bus now and do not

think that it will be an issue.


Why did the previous head fail? Did the PO give you any reasons?

If the exhaust valves failed you can attribute that to the missing exhaust
gaskets and you'll probably be heading down the same road as the PO.
