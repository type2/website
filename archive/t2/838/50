Subject: AIRS Q?

I love Friday Topics.. lol

I was looking all over the AIRS site, and was wondering if there is
any kind of decal that we can get that would show our bus as an AIRS
member?

If not, shall I make some and sell them?  They'd be pretty cheap, I'm
sure I can do them for less than $2 each.
