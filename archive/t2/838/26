As my shroud corroded it was clearly greyish (the same look as out  
aged transmission):

...but after I sandblasted my shroud it was brownish. The first photo  
from my website shows what the camera saw:

Since our conversation I now have a picture of a NOS shroud:

What's not clear in the photo is if the grey coating is revealing the  
brown or vice versa.
