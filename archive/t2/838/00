Subject: Re: [T2] 82 Torque Converter Scraping Noise

It depends on what is scraping. Is it more noticible in a certain gear? When
idling when moving forward, or reverse, or just sitting still?

Different parts move during certain operations of the trans, if it happens
in neutral or park, while not moving it could be the convertor, or the pump
circuit.  It is interesting that the convertor and seal went after a
rebuild, which would indicate that the convertor bushing was not replaced
during the rebuild.  If that was the case it could be going again, or the
noise could just be an indication that one of the worn bushings was not
replaced during the rebuild either.  If you are not having shifting
problems, and are not seeing hard metal in the fluid and filter when you
change it I would suggest you wait, and not worry, or get another spare to
have on hand if have the cash.

I would also suggest you check the convertor mounting bolts, because if they
are loose, they would make a scraping sound.
