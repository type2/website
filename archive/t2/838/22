Hi Mark,

It might help to take a look at the fan grilles used in the PC Mod  
community... Those guys have lots of different sized grille options  
for those who are looking to vent their high-performance gaming rigs.

Here's an example; it's not perfect for your application but I'm sure  
the design could be modified to improve airflow.

If you had one cut from copper you could chrome it; that'd be good  
for an extra 5HP for sure!   ;-P


Happy trails,
