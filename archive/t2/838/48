When I removed the original hydraulic sticker from my shroud it was brown underneath. At the time I couldn't tell if it was due to a reaction with the adhesive or otherwise.

I thought aged shrouds were greyish all over until I started to look into 914 engine compartments. Their shrouds seem to corrode differently than ours and I've seen the brownish aged look several times now.

Having seen more evidence of this, some kind of coating or oxidization may have been present.
