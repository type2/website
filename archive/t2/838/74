Subject: 1981 Vanagon Westfalia for Sale in NJ - $2500

Hello, 
   
  I have a 1981 Vanagon Westy which I and others have done a ton of work to, including - 
   
  1.  Engine was rebuilt by Scott at Bob's Beetle Shop, in Mantoloking, NJ, less than 1500 miles ago.  
   
  2.  Rear brakes completely rebuilt
   
  3.  Gas tank removed, cleaned, all hoses replaced.
   
  4.  Automatic Transmission was rebuilt about three years ago - shifts and runs smoothly.
   
  5.  Pop Top has new paint.  Body does, too, but it didn't come out as well as hoped.  It neeeds a new paint job.
   
  6.  All new exhaust installed about a year and half ago.  
   
  7.  No rust anywhere.  
   
  She passed inspection in NJ back in September with no problem.  She won't need to be re-inspected in NJ until 9/07.  Brakes are good and tires have lots of tread left.
   
  It's almost, but not quite there.  It runs strong, starts right up and all that good stuff.  All the camping equipment works.  Back seat cushion is ripped.  Seats are upgraded to newer ones with armrests.  Pop top has one small tear in the back, but otherwise in good condition.  
   
  Only three problems I know of - 
   
  1.  To start it you have to crack the accelerator.  I think there is a problem with the auxillary air regulator.
   
  2.  I'm having an issue getting it to restart when it's hot.  It turns over just fine, it just doesn't catch.  I think the problem is a bad temp sensor #2.
   
  3.  Slight oil leak.  I think it's coming from the front seal.
   
  I think anyone with a little VW experience could solve all three problems in a day or two.
   
  I've invested more than five grand in her.  However, I'm starting graduate school soon, and just won't have the time to invest in her.
   
  I can send pictures if anyone is interested.
   
  Thanks -
