Don't feel too bad.  I also misread the torque wrench when I replaced 
my heads.   I ended up with 21 inch pounds instead of 21 ft 
pounds.  Naturally, this was discovered after I installed the 
engine.  And no, you can't reach all of the head bolts with the 
engine in, so I had to pull it out, re-torque, and re-install (alone).

That was a long day.
