Subject: Spark plug torque?

Bentley says 22ft/lbs. Is that for real? I just put the plugs in and tried
to torque them to that setting. That's nearly what the heads need to be
torqued at!

I've got them torqued to that setting now, but it just seems like WAY too
much.

BTW: To those who say pulling heads with the engine in the bus- Bah! No
problem! Just finished the first round of 24ft/lbs. Will do it again in the
morning. Honed cylinders, new piston rings, lapped cylinders to heads, found
the "new" head I borrowed from Troy has a valve ready to sink (can't do
anything about it. Just hope it lasts until I get my 2.0 built... But
there's a welded crack in the same cylinder between the valves, so it may
have been due to that repair. I'll watch it...), etc.

I should be able to fire it up tomorrow afternoon!
