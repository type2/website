I can hardly contain myself with this one---

Who on God's earth measure's torque at a spark plug?

Is a torque wrench a security blanket for just not forgetting to tighten
them down?

Then wada ya do--write down the torque reading of each plug in each
hole?

If ya were doing a radial engne, or maybe even a V-12--16 I would
understand all this concern.

You working with a flat, 4 holed engine here sport fans---who needs to
torque the plugs down?

I truly have heard another good ore tonight.

Pleeeeze------
