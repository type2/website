Subject: Exhaust Manifold Torque Values

In the middle of reassembling the exhaust manifold to the AMC Head.  What's
the torque value.  Trying the green VW guide book and cannot find it.
There should be one, and I do not know what it is.
 
Also do you tighten 1 then 3 then 2 then 4 type of thing.

This is for a 2.0L FI Engine for a 78 Riviera.
