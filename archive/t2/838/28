I like unique colors:

Yes, that's my bald head.

I really destroyed that finish when I pulled the engine last time. Because
of the pushed in rear valance, it wouldn't clear. :( Now I know I need to
remove the shroud BEFORE dropping or installing engine.

I will be repainting mine this weekend. I wonder what color this time?
