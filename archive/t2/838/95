FYI, Spec on the Bosch W8AC is 19 ft. lbs.

I wasn't sure yesterday to go with the Bentley value or the Bosch
value so I split the difference and used 21.5. I agree with Terry that
I usually don't use a torque wrench for plugs, but since it was a
brand new head and since the wrench was sitting there, hey, what was
there to lose?

peace
