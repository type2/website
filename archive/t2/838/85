I woke up around 5 this morning, and couldn't fall back asleep.  I'm 
having some surgery tomorrow and won't be able to drive for a week or 
so, so I decided to go for a drive.  Once I got permission from the 
mother ship (wife) I packed up the camera and headed to Rocky Mountain 
National Park.  Once inside the park I came across some sheep almost 
immediately...

...After taking a few pics of the sheep I snapped a quick pic of the bus...

...And headed off to Bear Lake.  Bear Lake is my favorite park of the 
park.  The views of my favorite park (Hallett Peak) are amazing.  Since 
I'm not physically up for hiking around the lakes I had to settle for 
some roadside pics...

...After parking and kicking up my feet for a while It was time to head 
home.  As I was nearing the Fall River Road entrance to the park I 
noticed a yellow Westy parked in a large turnoff.  I pulled in next to 
it and got out and met Jack, his wife and their newly purchased 76 
Westy.  We chatted for several minutes before I headed off towards 
home.  It was a great day.  Hopefully the memory will help me through 
the next 7 to 10 days while the bus stays garaged waiting for my recovery.
