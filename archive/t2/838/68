Understood...Altho' if you just used the plastic sheeting on the 
outside...Kinda like my aunt with the plastic slipcovers over
everything in her living (?) room... ?-)

FWIW, there's an older couple in my hood that drive a fairly
ratty 60 Buick...Except for the interior; it's pristine. They
have plastic covers on the seats (Rayco ?-) and bedsheets
over them... ;-)
