Subject: Dynamat & POR15

Morning, (here anyways)
	The floor of my 78 has a descent amount of surface rust spots
through out it.  Mostly in the rear seating area.  My plans were to first
thoroughly clean all the rust off and possibly take that whole seating area
to bare metal in preparation for POR15.
	After this is all done though, I would like to put a few strips of
Dynamat or similar product down on the floor as well.  Does anyone know if
this would cause a problem.  I have not played with Dynamat yet or POR15 and
am not sure if there will be an adhesion issue.
	I've contacted Dynamat but they have to info in regards to
applications in this manner.

Have a good weekend...
