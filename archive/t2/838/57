Subject: Hubcap Compatibility

Hello,
Found a hubcap today at a garage type sale.  The guy only had one. It was in
great shape so I bought it ($5).  Ibm not sure what it belongs tob& maybe a
pre 68 bus?  The cap is quite round.  Not like the 68-79 flatter type I have
on
my bus.
I have a spare mounts on the front nose of the bus that faces outwards.  I
was hoping it would fit.  It does. It looks greatb& really bubbles outwards.
The
opening is about the same abit over 9 B= inches.  Will it fall off?  Was
wondering about other caps that fit the 68-72.   Anyone using these rounded
caps
all the way around?
Thanks.
