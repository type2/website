Subject: RE: [T2] Steering gear box leaking?

Eric,
I bought my rebuilt steering box from Michael Grice.  I can not recommend
Mike highly enough!!!!!  He's not only fair and honorable and provides a
terrific product...but he one heck of a nice guy.  Mike bent over backwards
to help me acquire a rebuilt tranny.  Mike email address in 2004 was...
oldpartfinder(-at-)yahoo.com

PS:  The steering box has worked out flawlessly!

My 76 bus has a new leak and it appears to be from the steering gearbox does
that occur often?

I guess I missed that maintenance step, check steering gearbox fluid level?

Does anyone know where I can get a rebuild/seal kit?

Thanks in advance
