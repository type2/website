Two thoughts:

Did you clean up the connection on the solenoid where the +ve lead 
from the alternator joins the rest of the wiring? This location is 
somewhat exposed and tends to build up corrosion and crud over time. 
I gained 0.5V (measured at the dash) after doing this.

I know you have a new battery but did you clean up the inside of the 
connectors on the battery leads before installing it?

HTH,

Martin.
