Subject: Fan grill

Seems to me I used to have a round speaker grill made of woven wire just
like what you are talking about. You might want to check out a custom car
stereo shop and see if they have something that resembles what you are
looking for.

On another note, I need the corner sheetmetal on my '78 Westy from just
behind the drivers side rear wheel well around to the engine lid and above
the taillight. Can anyone recommend a source for the repair panel/panels?
