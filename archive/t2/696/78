Before you go ripping the generator out. Do you have a proper alternator
upgrade "kit"? Do you have the correct oil filler/stand to fit an
alternator? Is your carb and fuel pump the proper design to clear an
alternator stand?

The fact that you didn't know you had to remove the fan (or loosen and tilt
the shroud -- or remove the intake and carb {I've used all 3 methods on a
bug, pulling the fan is actually easiest}) to get the generator out makes
me think you are "shooting blind" with no instructions or diagrams of what
is required to replace a generator with an alternator on a type 1 motor.

I wouldn't suggest doing that.

I don't have links to instructions handy. Perhaps others here will chime
in. Search the archives, library, and google.

The fan nut is a 30mm nut
