Subject: Re: ListServs and Pix

Just to chime in here - it's not just a matter of having a list server 
that gives you the option of receiving or not receiving inline pix and 
letting everyone choose.  We don't want people choosing to do something 
wasteful because they don't understand what's involved.

Sending photos thru a listserv is just a bad use of the technology, 
even if everyone on the list has DSL.  Why?  It adds to the overall 
level of traffic on the net.

When you attach a file (pic, doc, ppt, whatever) to an email and send 
it out to a bunch of people, all those copies go to everyone -- even 
the people who don't want them.  It's a waste of bandwidth.  On the 
other hand, if you post the pic on web space and send everyone its URL, 
only those who want it have to bother with downloading it.

Just because it's easy to send attachments and inline HTML cheese to 
six gazillion people at one time doesn't make it smart.  There are WAY 
too many free web photo hosts to excuse anyone from doing it the right 
way.

Let's keep email plain text, especially when we have a large, diverse 
user community.  We *want* to see your pix, so put em on the web and 
send us the URL!
