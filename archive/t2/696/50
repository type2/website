I once tried to tow my bus with a tow dolly from Uhaul.  The tow vehicle 
was an '88 Lincoln Town Car... that's a full size car, and weighs just 
about as much as the bus.  As soon as we got on the freeway with that 
bus in tow, it started swaying back and forth and we almost lost control 
of everything.  We promptly brought the dolly back and made other 
arrangements. 

I don't know why it did that, but I have the feeling it was because of 
the dolly.  A four wheel trailer might work out.  The absolute best way 
to tow anything with a steel bumper is to use a tow bar. 

Another problem we had was with Uhaul.  Don't expect to walk in there 
and tell them you're towing a bus with your pontiac 6000.  They will not 
rent you anything.  Uhaul has some kind of list of vehicle weights and 
tow weights and if you're not towing a smaller car with a bigger car, 
you don't get a rental.  We had to tell them we were towing a PT Cruiser 
to get them to put a dolly on the back of our lincoln.  That was the 
only way they'd rent us anything. 

Anyway, just be careful, and don't rule out having someone with a 
flatbed bring it home for you.  I had that bus towed from Louisville, KY 
to Buffalo, NY for $400.  It was worth every penny.
