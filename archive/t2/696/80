Good morning,

I am also a rather silent enjoyer of this list, being an owner of a
bay-window for almost three years now I consider myself still a newbie.
Although I skipp topics not relevant to me, I have learned more than a lot
following your mostly very enjoyable conversations. I subscribed to other
aircooled lists too, but none are as lively as this one. And on top of all
that, I really like the attitude you all spread.
Next year me and my girlfriend leave for a trip from Belgium through Turkey,
camping in our 'buske' for six months, so anything you guys can add to my
honest knowledge is really welcome!
I guess it might be the right time to sponsor the list a bit.

Belgian greets,

Bart
