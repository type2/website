Subject: Leaking Oil

I'm leaking a fair amount of oil after engine install.  I have been advised and I have started to replace the push rod seals.  After getting underneath I noticed a fair amount of accumulation around the "jugs" or cylinder heads. Not sure of the nomenclature.  Is there a way to remove the said parts without removing the engine.   I'll have the head off replaceing the push rod seals already.  Just wondering how far I can go without removing engine......again........  :-(
