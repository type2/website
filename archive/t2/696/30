well so far so good i finally got a new breather and hoooked new hose to it and ran it out the side of the bus where the battery sits and so far no oil has went into the peanut butter jar.
keeping a constant eye on it...it just wasnt doing right with the engine good enough running to the carb.(the hose)
the bus is still running a little funny at times but hoping thats just from the almost bum carb...
still runs but really just need a new carb now...
want to thank all that replied back and gave what they could when i was in my time of madness going loco over a brand new engine same problems...
lets hope that she behaves now and is ready to finally be back on the road again .. breaks over LOL
peace
Chris




Peace and Love
