Subject: Brakes!

Last weekend I finally got the brakes finished off including hooking
up the brake booster.

The first time I drove it afterwards I kept forgetting to push in the
clutch and take it out of gear when coming to a stop. Why? I thought I
was driving the Volvo with 4 wheel disk brakes and a monster brake
booster!

This thing stops like a dream now! I never knew how GOOD the brakes on
a bus could be. I'm *VERY* impressed.

The biggest problem was the right rear brake cylinder was leaking. I
replaced that puppy, did pads/shoes all around, couldn't find my
#(-at-)%^#$ brake lines I bought (still can't. WTF did I do with them????)
so I bled the brakes completely with my wife pumping the pedal because
I can't find my hand bleeder either (Arrrgghhh!!!!!) Talk about taking
forever! Heh

Also, last night I discovered the brake booster balance pipe boots are
shot. Badly. I hit them with some duct tape to hold me until I can get
to a FLAPS today and try using some right angle spark plug boots to
seal them up... Brake boost is even better now that those are somewhat
sealed. Hmm... wonder why? LoL!
