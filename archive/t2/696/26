Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking Oil

Clayton asked:


 I'm leaking a fair amount of oil after engine install.  I have been advised and I have started to replace the
push rod seals.  After getting underneath I noticed a fair amount of accumulation around the "jugs" or
cylinder heads. Not sure of the nomenclature.  Is there a way to remove the said parts without removing the
engine.   I'll have the head off replaceing the push rod seals already.  Just wondering how far I can go
without removing engine......again........  :-(

73 bus with no name

What engine do you have in your 73 bus?  Are you in the USA with a USA bus?
If yes, then you should have a 1700 typeIV engine. You do NOT remove the head to replace the pushrod tube
seals. Just the valve cover, rocker arm assembly, and pushrods. The tubes come out
the hole in the head.

This is not true if you have a 1600 type1 engine in your 73. Not sure where you are with your Yahoo email
address.
