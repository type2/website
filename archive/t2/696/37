Without benefit of RAtwell's garage, that's always a threat :)
Seriously, though, I'll go through the procedures with a pad of paper
and id all the tools and parts needed and check that against what I
have. I should be very close to set. From a "big tools" perspective, I
lack a high ceiling garage (so the bus will be in the driveway for the
pull). I have a standard (read: 1/2 full of stored stuff) one-car
garage, one 2-ton floor jack, jack stands and a motorcycle jack. I
think that leaves me short one floor jack for the bus-raising. 

Don't take risks with your health. If you're not up for it, I totally
understand. You don't want that cold to camp out and turn into
pnuemonia or bronchitis or something.

On the way home last night, one of my push rod tube seals gave up, and
started a-leaking real bad. Should I bother replacing the seals before
the weekend, or should I just add it to the list of stuff to do this
weekend? I guess the real question is: is it easier to replace the
seals with the engine in or out? Regardless of when I do it, the bus
sits until its done.
