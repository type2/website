Hopefully I'll also be mostly over this nasty cold that I came down
with *this* weekend.  I rarely get sick, so when something *does*
come along it really knocks me on my arse.

.. guess its a good thing you're doing your bus this weekend and 
not last..  Any tools you think you'll need and don't have?
