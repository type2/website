The thing to remember about a generator (as opposed to
alternator) is that the generator onle charges while
is engine is revving higher than idle.  With engine
running, attach voltmeter to battery, rev engine and
watch the voltage on the meter, it should read between
13-14 Volts while engine is revving. If it does not,
then you either have a wiring problem or a generator
problem.
