The 34PICT3 accel pump linkage conflict with a new Bosch alternator is no big
deal *IF* someone shows you how to do it!

You just need to turn a piece around so it looks like this:

Vendors, PLEASE feel free to include these pictures with your alternator
conversion kits.  Listmembers, please feel free to post and/or distribute
these photos as you see fit.

You probably do need the different stand & back plate, which come with the
alternator conversion kit from Bus Depot & probably other vendors too.

p.s. My '71's mechanical fuel pump doesn't conflict with the alternator in any
way.  Never even considered it!  Maybe it's a problem with different years?
