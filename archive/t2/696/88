Tom,

Before I had 15 of the durn plastic ones laying all around, I used to use 
a socket that "just" fit to set it up.  I'm sure that other folks will 
chime in on this too.

You *don't* have to have the $22.00 tool.....

You can always eyeball it to make sure it is centered before you torque it 
down.

Cheers, dave
