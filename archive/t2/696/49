Chris, you said:::


"well so far so good i finally got a new breather and hoooked new hose to it 
and ran it out the side of the bus where the battery sits and so far no oil 
has went into the peanut butter jar.
keeping a constant eye on it...it just wasnt doing right with the engine 
good enough running to the carb.(the hose)"

OK, what do you mean, having the oil breather hose running to the carb! Did 
you connected the hose directly to the carb and not the air cleaner via the 
charcoal canister??


I guess it will take a bit of time, but I guess I can search the archives to 
find what year bus and size engine and a single / dual carb...  I was under 
the impression that you had a FI bus   You MUST have told people in the past 
just how the oil breather hose was connected!??!?


then you were probably getting
