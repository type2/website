Hi Miles,

A 72-79 bus does not have a removeable rear apron. You have to raise 
the bus and pull the engine out from under it. With practice, you can 
still do a complete engine drop in less than an hour on an FI or 
double-carb bus. AMHIK.

On the good side... the 72-79 bus has the tranny bolted to the bus, so 
it doesn't need a support.

Happy trails,
