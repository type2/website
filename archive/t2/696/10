Volks,

Well, I am sorry to say that pictures are not going to happen.  This is
not just because they don't belong in e-mail (THEY DON'T!) but because
they are incredibley expensive to send.  The problem is that with a list,
you have to multiply the number of bits sent in by 1,000-1,500 to get the
number of bits sent out.  Multiply that by 30-50 posts per day and the
numbers get ridiculous very quickly.  One of our older members (David
Raistrick) used to have a .sig pushing "the ASCII ribbon campaign" and for
cost reasons, that is going to have to be it until they give out bandwidth
for free (which is not anywhere on the horizon)

This list is OLD![1]  It started up back in the days when the internet was
new and dial-up was the norm.  Today I'd bet that 30-60% of the members
have ADSL or cable bu as the recent posts show, there is still a fair
dial-up community out there.  Picture sites are readily available, if you
can put up with the pop-ups.  Most modern mail readers will render
well-formed URLs in text as links, even in an all-text message. If it's a
procedure, write up a web page and post a link to the page.

[1] I think we missed our ten-year aniversary, should have been held last
fall sometime.  Gerry Skerbitz, the man to blame for all of this started
the list some time in the fall of 1994.  I know I got on in January of '95
and the list was a going concenr by then.  TEN YEARS!!!  Damn... where did
the time go?
