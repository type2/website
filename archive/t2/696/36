Subject: Re: [T2] High-lift jack?

Well, I didn't get stuck beneath the engine! Everything came out
smoothly - my first ever engine drop! I have a sneaking suspicion that
getting the new engine in is gonna be a lot harder!!

Anyway, in all the excitement, I forgot to measure the height to which
I had to jack the bus. I think my situation would differ from most,
though, as my driveway slopes off to the side - one wheel was a good
8-10" off the ground, the other just a few inches.

I think that installing a removeable apron would be a lot more work
than simply jacking up the bus each time or backing up onto ramps?

Cheers,
Mike.
