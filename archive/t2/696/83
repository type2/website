Don, the original beds in the Oz Campmobiles, at least, are fine for 
extended trips, my ex and I used to go away for a 6 week holiday each year 
in Tigger ( as transport & a base for hiking, cycling etc ), my '74 
Campmobile, and the bed was fine, while Bart's trip is longer, if it works 
for 6 weeks, it'll work for 6 months.

BTW: Bart, Mike Knappmann's pages 
http://vwbus.dyndns.org/bulli/michaelk/vw_bus_e/mein_bus.htm & 
http://vwbus.dyndns.org/bulli/michaelk/vw_bus_d/mein_bus.htm have a lot of 
information about travelling in places like Morocco and fixing up the bus 
for that sort of trip, they might be useful, they're certainly very 
interesting. I'm jealous, your trip should be wonderful ;^)
