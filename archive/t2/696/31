I repaired the VDO clock in my 84 Vanagon with the procedure below...it may be of use to some late bus owners...

------------

My 1984 analog clock was broken. The hands never moved. I read in the archives it can usually be fixed by replacing the two capacitors approx $2.00 in parts (Radio Shack part number 272-1044).

The new capacitors made my clock work like new!
It is not too difficult but you have to be comfortable with a soldering iron (and de-soldering procedures).  But with anything, YMMV

Here's how to do it:
