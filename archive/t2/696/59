One things for sure, if you have some kind of accident in a rental truck
while hauling a vehicle inside the box you better have deep pockets because
any sane rental agreement forbids transporting vehicles inside of a box
truck...

Besides if your already renting a big truck how much more is it to rent a
flatbed transport trailer to go behind it? I know Ryder rents flatbed
trailers, not sure who else.

more than a tow dolly and drove the bus up in it and towed it that away....

could be done?
