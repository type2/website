Subject: RE: [T2] Nut size on fan end of generator

"I'm trying to put an alternator in my 70 bus, but I can't get the generator 
out...  I noticed there was a very large nut on the front end of the 
generator that holds the fan on. "

Well, I guess 'congratulations' on calling FIF!!


"Anyway, I need to know the size of the nut, so I can go beg, borrow and/or 
steal a socket from work tomorrow.  Anyone have that number for me?"

You may come across a SAE 1 13/16".  Don't pass it by.  It 'may' be a tad 
loose, but on a 6-point socket or wrench, it should work fine.  IAEF [

I recommend that you 'beg'.  If you 'borrow', it will lay heavy on your mind 
until you return the socket/wrench

BTW, I recently researched the swap of an alternator into the generator's 
position.  In addition tot he different base, there has been comments on the 
standard carb linkage getting in the way, and on shifting the mechanical 
fuel pump some 15 degrees or so to may room for the fatter alternator.  i 
got so confused, I gave up on the project.
