!!!! 6 Months??!?!?!?!?!

Fold out bed? What shape is the foam in? If it's not really good
you're going to have a sore back after 6 days, let alone 6 months. heh

A great trick if you do have lumpy foam is to use an inexpensive air mattress. 

Oh, and buy a digicam and post pics!!!! 

=D

Sounds like a blast! Wish I was going...
