Well, pacemakers and other medical devices are pretty well hardened to
such things as the makers don't want their users dropping dead.

Car computers are also rather well hardened, as they are made to move
about and might be driven into a high-RF environment.

The thing that will really suffer when Officer Friendly fires up his
car-stopper is every piece of consumer electronics in a half-mile radius.
Computers, appliances, audio, video, all shut down either temporarily or
for good.
