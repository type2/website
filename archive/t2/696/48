Subject: Re:  Valve questions..................Follow up, problem

3 weeks or so ago I posted a question about our 78 bus and the squeaking  
coming from the right side of the engine and was looking for input.
 
I received many responses, thank you all, ranging from pull the engine and  
pull the heads to probably a valve seat problem, to do a compression test, to 
do  a leak down test, to readjust the valves etc.... Perhaps you remember.
 
Well a couple days after all the initial responses someone, and I can't  find 
the message to thank that person properly, but your message went something  
like this:
 
"I may be a bit late chiming in here, but when my bus was making a high  
pitched chirping sound I tightened down the bolts holding the carb/FI onto the  
head and it went away...."
 
Well since I had had the engine out 2 weeks before I thought well just  maybe 
that could be it and I wouldn't have to pull the engine again!  Sure  enough, 
after I tightened the 4 bolts holding my Weber on that side it went  away.  I 
finally had the proper combination of warmer weather up here in  
Massachusetts and time away from work. 
 
So, thank you one and all for helping me get this taken care of.  I am  so 
glad it was just a little easy fix like that.  I guess there was just a  little 
bit of air getting by and that caused the chirping.
 
Now onto the next problem, I mean joy that comes with owning busses!   Spring 
is coming!
 
Mark, I find your posts very thorough,informative and entertaining.   Don't 
let one dumb a$$ stop you from posting.
