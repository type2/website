Subject: Aftermarket Fuse Boxes -70

Hello,  Does anyone know of a source of aftermarket fuse boxes for our
buses?  After having 2 used ones for my 70 bus crumble in my hands, I
thought about changing it completely out to a aftermarket 12 point box
either using German type fuses or blade type.  Any suggestions?
