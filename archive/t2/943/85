Subject: Cold start problem on '71

Hi all,

I'm having cold start problems in my '71 camper.  It's a stock setup with
the exception of swapping the PICT34 for a new PICT30/31 replacement.

I have problems with having to pump the accelerator rapidly during warmer
weather while cranking in order to get it to start, but now that it's colder
(i.e. below 50 degrees), I can't even get it to start at all.  It just
cranks and cranks.  The PICT34 had similar issues during warmer weather, but
I never tried it in cold weather because I'd already swapped it out before
the brutal California winter.  :)  My '67 Bug with essentially the same
configuration has no problem at all - fires right up, so I know how these
motors are supposed to work in the cold.  Plus, seeing all the pics of other
buses in the snow makes me kinda jealous.  :)  I just got new Hankooks and
wanted to take them up to the snow in a couple weeks.

The butterfly on the carb is closing completely, so the choke is working
properly.  What else could be different during cold start?  A crack in a
head or something like that, which isn't a huge problem during warm weather
but gets big enough when the cold makes it contract?  Compression was
supposedly OK on all 4 cylinders, although I don't have exact specs from the
mechanic who checked it.  It definitely runs rich once it's running.  A few
weeks ago I got it to start in sub-50 temps by putting a portable heater in
the engine compartment for about 40 minutes.  Maybe it's an electrical
problem with the amount of current I'm able to draw?  I hooked up a booster
battery to the battery and didn't have any better results.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

John
