Gary -

Sounds like the distributor you were supplied with is a Bug Upright 1600
style, based on the description you provide.

To properly ID this distributor I would need at least the Bosch number
stamped into the casing.  There is also the VW number stamped into the
casing as well.  Once I have those I can give an educated guess to all of
the questions.

Single Vac Distributors were used on Late 76-78 Buses, & 79-83 Federal
Bus/Vanagons, all equipped with points/condensor, timed at 7.5 degrees
BTDC.  Dual Vac 79-83 California Bus/Vanagons were equipped with Hall
Ignition, timed at 5 degrees ATDC
