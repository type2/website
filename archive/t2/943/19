Subject: RE: [T2] accelerator cable linkage on transmission?

From the voice of experience, make sure the pivot arm on the tranny is NOT
BENT.  Mine was, the result of a sloppy installation by the PO.  Made it
impossible to achieve full-throttle, as the range of motion was reduced by
the shortening of the arc-length of the arm.

on the underside looking up on the passenger side (lft hand drive) about
two thirds the way to the front there will be a lever about 6 inches long
sticking up, just above the pivot point there will be a ball, press the
cup part of the accell linkage over the ball, put some light grease or
lube like 90weight oil in the cup before pressing it on.

hope this helps
Bob
