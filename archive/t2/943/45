Hi James,

Those look good to me, but it will be a PITA to seal a box shaped  
like that. You probably know that already.

I have speakers in that location in my bus and also installed them  
there in another's bus... I find that they are much easier to hear  
when placed there than when installed on the kick panels or in the  
doors.

I also found that a pair of 4x9's installed in the rear valence  
provides much better sound than a pair of 6x9's under the Z-bed, but  
when combined the results are even better.
