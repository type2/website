Only Buses and Kombis; Panel Vans don't.  And neither do Splitties,
which was the OP's question; although it may hurt, I'd recommend
welding in such mounting points.  Bolted-in seatbelts (bolt through
the floor, nut on othe side) will be torn out in a collision, which 
is when you'd really like them not to be.  At the very least, spread 
the load by bolting in a *thick*, *large* piece of sheet steel on the
underside of the floor.

Definitely.  The seat frame isn't built for that kind of load.
 
Airhowlingly yours,
