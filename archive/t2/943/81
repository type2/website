Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone using a Battery Minder

I've got one hooked up in each of my bus (and mini) right now.  It's a
good way to ensure your vehicle will start when most of the driving
you do is in the cold, with the heater and lights on.  The battery
remains fully charged and slightly warmed up.  I keep the chargers in
the cars year round - they're permanently mounted.

I've got an automatic one that is intended to be connected to the
battery post terminals - the connectors go underneath the terminal
tightening bolts.  On the mini, it's connected to the starter solenoid
since the battery is in the boot and getting an extension cord into
the boot isn't as easy as under the bonnet :-).

I can't remember the name/make, but they're similar to this one:
