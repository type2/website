Subject: FW: [T2] Dual Carbs on a 2.0L, Brake Booster Vacuum line

I did this with my dual IDF style Redline/Weber EFI system exactly as you
described. It is really sensitive to vacuum issues and has had no problems.
I used a combination of regular rubber vacuum line and fuel line up to the
power brake booster. 1/2" fuel line is pretty burley and should work great.

I suspect it is a leak in the line, attachment point, tapped fitting or the
booster. If the line collapsed, it sounds like it is actually helping your
situation since pinching off the line fixes the problem.

You certainly don't need to tap all 4 lines. Chris (-at-) bustedbus did the same
thing with his '72 camper and could offer specific insight.

I would start plugging the line further and further up the chain until it
stops making a difference to diagnose where the leak is located.

(I really should go work on my own project, enough computer today!)

OK, Here's the shit-uation...  I've got a '72 camper that I recently put a 
2.0L engine and trans out of a '79 and swaped it over to dual carbs (36 
Webers).  My question is how to hook up the brake booster vacuum line.  The 
manifolds I have, have already been tapped for a booster line, but only in 
one barrel on either side of the engine.  The engine runs fine off-idle, but

it backfires and sputters and eventually dies at idle.  I'm assuming that 
the booster line has something to do with it as when I plug/pinch off the 
lines it idles just fine.  Is there a special type of hose to use to prevent

it from colapsing from the vacuum? (I'm using 1/2" fuel hose right now) Do I

need to tap into all 4 barrels?  Suggestions, comments, questions welcome.  
Thanks
