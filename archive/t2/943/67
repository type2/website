Subject: CHT Sensor on new 1600 heads

Hi,

My install of new heads on my 1600 is complete and up and runnning. I
noticed the new heads each have holes tapped, presumable for a CHT
sensor(s). I understand this is probably for use on 1600 FI Beetles.
Where could I find sensors for these heads that I could use with a
standard temp guage such as the VDO guage? Sure would save some time
and effort in the future if I could make these heads last a long time.

thanks
