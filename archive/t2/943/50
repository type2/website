Yes, the distributor that AC.net carries uses 009 style cap & rotor. 
What this means to you is (obviously) the cap is off by 90 degrees. Be 
after you install it you rotate the wires around one time to match it 
back up. I'm not sure why it is this way, but to swap between 
distributors you have to move the wires in the cap. Other wise the 
engine timing is off by 90. good luck
