	A friend of mine managed a factory making such batteries.  He 
insists they do have to cycle, i.e   it's not just a matter of 
keeping them as fully charged as they will take at successive times; 
you should run them down pretty far, and then re-charge.
	Some 'battery minders' do this.  It always strikes me as a 
waste; better to run some 12V device by the battery and so get some 
use out of the discharge phase of the cycle.
