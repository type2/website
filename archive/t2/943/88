only the Automatic has a cable to the tranny. and that is to operate the
kickdown feature (talk about an oxymoron) but that is the short cable and
it uses a rod to the engine from the tranny.

if you need to stretch the accel cable (or any cable) consider extending
it at the front, my drop floor bus needed all cables extended a bit and
all the extensions are up front using a rod with a cable clamp on it.
