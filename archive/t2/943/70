Subject: East Coast events

I think I'm going to be financing my type 2 habit (the one that I 
almost kicked) by making Westy SO-23 interiors for custom applications. 
One of the apps (I thought about this a few years ago and mentioned it 
as a possibility on the list) is an SO-23 for baywindow buses (or even 
for Vanagons, I suppose).

The other is a basic SO-23 interior to stand alone, for instance in the 
corner of a family room or basement. The backs of the basic pieces will 
be finished, and all the parts will work as they would in a bus. You 
could use it as a guest bed, for instance.

(If you don't know what an SO-23 is, there's a picture in the type 2 
library)

If I were still on the west coast, I'd show it at Familienfest, the 
Classic, and Jerome.

Are there any equivalent east coast events?

(I ordered two new valve covers from Bus Depot this morning. They were 
on sale. I'm on my way to a bus!!!)
