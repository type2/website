Subject: Thinking about ...

... getting a bus some day from the earlier stock. I don't know the 
earlier buses so well, so here are some questions (not easily answered 
by going to the archives):

1. Is it still the case that a 1600 engine costs about 1/4 to 1/3 what 
it costs to build a 2000? (law of averages, YMMV, etc. understood)

2. I don't remember anyone talking about upgrading to the later beetle 
fuel injection systems. I'm assuming this is an easy upgrade?

3. Can all three earlier years be upgraded to the standard of the '71 
(brakes, etc.)?

Thanks.

in Escondido, CA)
