Subject: accelerator cable

Well, I ordered the two longest cables for my 1.7L with the single weber carb.  Neither may be long enough and I'm expecting to have to combine parts of the two to get it to the carb.  I found nothing in Bentley and only vague information in Haynes.  Don't have Muir yet. Bentley probably figures it's easy enough to figure out that it didn't warrant a reference.  But I could screw up an anvil, ha.    Any advice before start ripping out the old one?  And why does the accelerator cable need a linkage to the transmission?  I thought it only regulated the carb.  Did someone say accelerator cable when they meant to say clutch cable?  I doubt it.  Thanks and cheers...KR
