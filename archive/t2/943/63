Hi George

thanks for the info. Tomorrow I'll look for the relay behind the 
fuses, and see if a parts place near me has one.   Thanks for the 
part number.

I really dont want to move behind the fuses this week, I am bound to 
dislodge some wire or other, so I will wait til AFTER BBB.  We have 
not replaced the trans-oil yet, and I am hoping that too can be 
post-BBB.

I really wonder why I bother, other drivers seem to ignore my signals 
anyway - it is hell to move right if one does not have a passenger 
with an arm stuck out!  I have not found a way to stop others cutting 
in too close either. Is this the new way of driving for most idiots? 
Some have been very close calls, and so scary.

Back to signals. I'm also concerned it is a low-power thing;   I 
forgot to mention -  when we rev up the flashing slows again. 
Rev-ing also helps the headlight output.

Maybe I should be doing voltage checks etc ;-(( It is probably 10 
years snce we put in a voltage regulator.  Then again, the flashing 
problem also happens when  the engine is not running altho it flashes 
properly for a bit longer in that case.

I hate things that can have multiple causes, one can get caught up in 
a game of logic.

--Thanks, Olive
P.S. Are you still going Rte 66 and early?
