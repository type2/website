A standard VDO CHT gauge expects a k-type thermocouple. You'd just  
need to terminate some thermocouple wiring to a suitable ring  
terminal and mount it to the sensor hole using a 10mm bolt.

Keep in mind that the temperature readings from that location are not  
in sync with the area around the spark plug where the thermocouples  
are usually placed. In order words, the temp readings you get won't  
be comparable to other engines that are using the spark plug terminal  
(99% of people).

That area of the head is also slow to respond to temperature changes.  
L-Jet mainly uses that location for warm up enrichment...
