I want to put a combination of this:

and this:

http://calypsocampers.co.uk/kitty.htm

in my 60 - which should be out of the body shop (after 3 years) within a 
week or so.

I also have about 90% of the interior of a 62 Devon:

http://www.devonmoonraker.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/OthersalesBrochures.html

I'm considering using parts from that ... but while I have 90% its condition 
ranges from 9 out of 10 to 3 out of 10 ....

I can see why you like the SO-23.
