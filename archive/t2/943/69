Subject: distributor caused poor starting, fast idle and random loss of

Methinks the 75 bus hard starting, "random loss of power" and random 
fast idle has been solved-daughter's bus has Pertronics, so such users 
forget that a timing light is useful for other things- while playing 
with the idle I noticed that while checking the RANGE of the advance 
that it would go to max but not always come down, causing a faster idle 
-and TAPPING on the distr body helped- ah-ha, centrifugal weights are 
sticking?  Tried using a penetrant/lube under plate- NaDa, so I yanked 
the distr and put in the spare points one from Ted Finemann's $5 parts 
box (thanks Ted, been carrying that around for years) and lo and behold, 
goes easily to 7 deg BTDC, idles fine on warm up and the milage jumped 
back up to 22 mpg on her trip back to school.  It also helped that I 
replaced the calipers- see add. post.

  I got some better light on the situation (actual light) this morning 
and saw
  the distributor clamp was bent just enough that the dizzy was raised 
up and
  the cam was disengaging. I fixed it by putting a washer under the hold 
down
  clamp on the engine block.
