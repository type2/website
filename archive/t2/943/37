Subject: SVDA in a 1600 DP

I just got an ACN SVDA Dizzy for use in my 1600 dual port. It is described
as "will work with a 1600 Dual Port or 1971 style motor" which I have.

 

Comparing it to the stock '70 Dizzy (and looking from the top), the rotor on
the SVDA is 90 degrees further counter-clockwise.

 

I can't get the motor to run in this configuration even though it is set up
exactly as the directions instruct. The SVDA looks exactly the same as my
'74 and '78 dizzys.

 

The rotor on the SVDA is pointing to cylinder #1 instead of pointing to the
seam and pulley as the Bentley and Haynes directions indicate. It is
pointing like I have a Type 4 motor, which concerns me.

 

So to pre-answer:

Yes, the motor is at #1 TDC at the indexed pulley and with a depth check on
Cyl #1.

Yes, I positioned #1 spark plug wire on the cap with the rotor at TDC (even
though it is off 90 degrees)

Yes, I have checked and re-checked the plug order. CW 1432 (ccw 1234)

Yes, a test light check shows that the compufire is triggering from negative
coil side.

 

John provides very detailed directions, but they are a bit vague on the
upright motor install and what confusions one may encounter. I don't want to
bother him since he seems very short on time. 

 

Has anyone done this install? Am I on track?

 

Confused.
