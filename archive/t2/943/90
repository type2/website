I am trying to keep it in the area of the optional shelf, it is 7" tall and 
doesn't come out past the front of the dash, I am over 6' tall but have 
really short legs (can't find shirts that fit) and I have been driving it 
around with the cardboard speaker for 2 days and have yet to have made 
contact, and somehow it hasn't fallen off the dash, which is pretty weird, I 
am trying to live with it for a week before continuing.

I am going to put in blind 3/8-16 inserts and try to figure out mounts at 
each end and in the middle, the middle looks easy, I plan to come off the 
frame piece that is on each side of the E-brake.

It will probably weigh around 25 pounds before we pile junk in the cubby 
holes.

The design will require a groove in the back for the E-brake to fit in, I 
think this will add a lot of strength.

Thanks for the input.
