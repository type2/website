Subject: attn-Kevin Moore email now?

Since Kevin was near where my daughter goes to college and is a bus 
(vanagon?) owner, I want to contact him- his
addy of kevinmoore(-at-)hargray.com bounced.  Due to a 2 second power 
failure/computer crash all my sent/kept mail of last year is gone. 
Running out to get a UBS now!
