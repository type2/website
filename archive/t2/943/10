Mark,

1. Yup, in some cases even less.

2. I looked into it and went with a much more modern unit. I couldn't find
enough complete parts from a super beetle and replacement parts were going
to cost me the same as the aftermarket kit. www.redlineweber.com

3. The only year a later disc brake beam will bolt up is late late-'69 to
'70. The '68 beam and earlier '69 beam has a smaller beam-to-frame bolting
pattern. However, you can weld in the power brake booster plate to a early
beam and swap out the spindles and brakes. Pretty straight forward. Don't
forget the rear brake pressure regulator though.

I have a whole tutorial somewhere on my '68 beam to disc conversion if you
would like me to forward it to you.

... getting a bus some day from the earlier stock. I don't know the 
earlier buses so well, so here are some questions (not easily answered 
by going to the archives):

1. Is it still the case that a 1600 engine costs about 1/4 to 1/3 what 
it costs to build a 2000? (law of averages, YMMV, etc. understood)

2. I don't remember anyone talking about upgrading to the later beetle 
fuel injection systems. I'm assuming this is an easy upgrade?

3. Can all three earlier years be upgraded to the standard of the '71 
(brakes, etc.)?

Thanks.

in Escondido, CA)
