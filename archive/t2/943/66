Subject: Re: [T2] are these 1.8 heads?

Hi Jeremy,

Another way to tell whta you've got is to measure the diameter of the  
valves. This would help identify what you have. Carb'ed heads have  
larger intake valves than the FI heads.  There was a post before the  
holidays about valve sizes... Check the archives; I don't have a copy  
here.

Also... Carbed heads (1974 1.8L) won't have the hole for the head  
temp sensor. And IIRC, the 1.8L heads with the head temp sensor have  
it located in a different spot... On the 2L's it's out by the intake  
manifolds but on the 1.8's it's inboard of the tinwork.


Happy Trails,
