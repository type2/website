Unless you have used the brakes, there should not be any airflow through
the vacuum line.  You either have a leak in the line or in the booster.

The correct vacuum line is metric, of course, but you can get acceptable
15/32" vacuum line at a well-stocked FLAPS.  The vacuum line I put in my
bus in '90 still looks and works great.
