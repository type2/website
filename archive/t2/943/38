Subject: RE: [T2] Thinking about ...Redline Weber EFI

George,

The kit came with everything I needed to install the system from clamps to
weld-in fuel bungs.

Specifically I installed it in my 68 Double Cab running a 1914 with a
hydraulic cam.

It cost around $2K with a MSD distributor, which the system uses exclusively
(but not necessarily needed).

The most difficult part of the install was getting the EFI bungs welded in
the top (for the return line) and the bottom of the fuel tank. I am a master
welder, but the tank needed to be cleaned and sealed and the same time. I
took it to a radiator shop and it took a long time (two weeks) and was sort
of expensive, around 350 bones. Next time I'll just do it myself.

The rest of the install was really straight forward and much like a
dual-carb install. The directions leave no questions really.

The baseline programming was for set "at sea level" so it took a lot of
tweaking to get it to run leaner at 5300 feet. Their technical help is
really great. I ended up taking it to a professional dyno tuner but it isn't
necessary. I just want it perfect.

When I cranked it the first time, it ran.

The power is huge and totally linear. Idle is rock solid regardless of temps
and fuel mileage is like a stock 1600 (if you don't put your foot in it all
the time racing soccer mom's) :)

OK, How much was it and how well did it work (ease of programming, etc.?)
