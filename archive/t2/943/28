Thanks to Robt, Greg, and Mark for answers to my questions.

I think I'm going to find a 1600 engine, maybe in a junkyard, get a new 
case, and start rebuilding it. Then, if and when I find the right bus, 
I'll have an engine for it.

It sure would be nice to have a bus again. I keep seeing the ad for 
"little miss sunshine," and the bus looks just like Peregrine.
