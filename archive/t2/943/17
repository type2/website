Bought a parts Beetle in Little Creek, VA. Stripped it for the pan which 
is under my Beetle, and then stripped it for everything else (gave parts 
away). Cut up the body with my then brand new Sawzall and put it in the 
recycling dumpster. Felt bad b/c other than needing a front clip (apron, 
hood, misc) it was a pretty good car and VERY solid.
