Subject: RE: [T2] seat belts in a splitty

All of the Bay Window's come with pre-threaded and reinforced lugs in the
floor for seatbelts.

You can purchase a retrofit kit with the re-enforced backing plates, washers
and seat bolt/washer. Bus Depot has replacement belts as to other vendors.

Attach them through the floor, not the seat frame.

Hope this helps,
