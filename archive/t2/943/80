Subject: dual vacuum dizzy

Just last week someone wrote the list about a problem that turned out to
be timing with one of the distributors that have dual vacuum lines , one
for advance and one for retard. I have motor here I am trying to get
together to put back in my  80 westy. I provided a engine  rebuilder
with my engine and he was supposed to put my accessories on a rebuilt
short block and send it back to me, well what I got back has none of my
accessories,   it has this dual vac distributor on it now , this is a 2
liter, air-cooled, fuel injected motor,  here are my questions:

-Is there any advantage to this one over a distributor with a single
vacuum line?

-Can I just swap this with a standard single line one and time it to 7.5
BTDC ? (I plan on using one off a 78  2 liter Air cooled FI motor)

-It looks like the notch for the # 1 position on this dual one is in a
different place, does that mean I need to change the distributor drive
gear setting ?

-From looking through the shop manual it looks like this dual one was to
be used in vehicles with electronic ignition , but this one has points
in it so what vehicles used these?

Any info much appreciated
