Please kill this thread.

Even on Fridays, posts must have bus content.

If you must reply to this type of post, please send the reply privately, 
not to the entire list.  The other 999 people on this list (including 
myself) do not want messages about an early-90's Honda filling up their 
inbox.

Thanks,
