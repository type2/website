Well have had a little time to work a little more on
the problem, just to get more confused. So far I have
checked the compression, it's good, changed the Brain,
AFM, coil, points, rotor and condenser, whole new
distributor, in case something was bad in it (still
quit) Put a fuel tester on it, when it is running it
is holding between 28-35 PSI depending on throttle
position. So the fuel filter and fuel pump is good,
when it dies the fuel pressure stays up, the fuel
pressure remains at 30 PSI or so for a long time, so
the regulator is working and the injectors don't leak
excessively. I thought I had it when I changed the
distributor, but after about three minutes of good
running it up and quit just like the ignition was
turned off(it died like the dog it is). Have checked
all the connections could a bad cylinder head temp
sensor do this to it. that is next to change. I'm
runing out of things to do. Phil
