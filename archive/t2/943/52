Jason,

That is one of the most clear and concise answers I have received. Thank you
for the explanation.

I remember a thread a few months back asking if a dizzy can run backward if
the wires were located correctly, and the answer was "yes" (with some vacuum
can clearance issues). This would make sense.

It sure throws you off when the service manual says one thing and the dizzy
points the wrong way!

Thanks again,

Jon

Yes, the distributor that AC.net carries uses 009 style cap & rotor. 
What this means to you is (obviously) the cap is off by 90 degrees. Be 
after you install it you rotate the wires around one time to match it 
back up. I'm not sure why it is this way, but to swap between 
distributors you have to move the wires in the cap. Other wise the 
engine timing is off by 90. good luck
