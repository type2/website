Subject: 1976 Bus Early or Late ?

Someone out there knows how to use my Westy VIN number to classify it as 
"Early 76" or "Late 76."

The serial number is 2362113334, model 2391 Basic Campmobile.

Knowing "Early" or "Late" is critical to ordering some replacement parts.

So, specifically, what is the VIN number that starts the "Late 76" series?

Proud Ohio owner of a 1976 VW Westfalia Camper. A friend bought it new and 
sold it to me in 1983 for $3,000, with 66,000 miles on the odometer.  I 
replaced the front beam in the middle 90's, rebuilt the engine in 1998, and 
have restored the upholstery and top. it will be ready for paint this summer.
