Olive, it sounds like you have a flasher that is ready to malfunction.
The flasher is what controls the flashing speed and it is common to both
left and right signals.

The flasher plugs into the bottom of the fuse block.  Sometimes when the
windshield leaks a bit the flasher fills with water which does bad things
to it.

The solution is to replace the flasher.  Not hard to do, but you do have
to lift the fuse block up on a '71, something that I don't like doing as
it disturbs all the wiring and sometimes creates more problems.  Do it as
gently as possible.

The turn signal flasher is part number 111 953 227A
