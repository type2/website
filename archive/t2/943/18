. Is it  still the case that a 1600 engine costs about 1/4 to 1/3 what 
it costs to  build a 2000? (law of averages, YMMV, etc. understood)

2. I don't  remember anyone talking about upgrading to the later beetle 
fuel injection  systems. I'm assuming this is an easy upgrade?

3. Can all three earlier  years be upgraded to the standard of the '71 
(brakes,  etc.)?

Thanks.



hello Mark  Type 1 is cheaper to build but might require building more  
often, There were brand new long blocks for $1500 . rebuilding some of the older  
engines doesn't work too well as some cases had problems with head studs 
pulling  and cracking. . 
the Fi systems on the old bugs were junk don't even bother with them,  
aftermarket like redline, megasquit are better but costly, I just as soon use  
carbs. 
I personally haven't ever seen a reason to change the brakes to discs , the  
drum brakes are plenty big enough.. Upgrading the master clylinder to a dual  
circuit is a good idea. The bay bus front axle beams aren't near as strong as  
the splittie beams. They had problems with the center pin mount ripping off 
and  of course ball jts breaking.   to each his own  later and have  fun  Mark
