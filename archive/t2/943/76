When I made the interior for Peregrine, the bus I gave away six months 
ago, I based it more on Devon cabinets than on Westfalia. I didn't 
really have a shop back then; I made the interior on the balcony of an 
apartment.

The Devon interiors are perhaps the most practical of the bus interiors 
(and the most variable). The SO-23, on the other hand, is just really 
nice and quite different from all the other campers, other Westfalias 
included.
