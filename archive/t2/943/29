Mark, I think it was John Stiles that just listed a nice old splitty for $900 that sounds like just what you need.  If it hasn't sold yet, maybe he'll clue you in.  You didn't way where you are.  I think he was in the Northeast.  And welcome back.  Cheers....KR

I think I'm going to find a 1600 engine, maybe in a junkyard, get a new 
case, and start rebuilding it. Then, if and when I find the right bus, 
I'll have an engine for it.

It sure would be nice to have a bus again. I keep seeing the ad for 
"little miss sunshine," and the bus looks just like Peregrine.
