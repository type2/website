Hi Volks,

I'll counter Robt's advice with a missive defending FI.

Sure, we hear about lots of FI issues here... those buses are newer  
and there are probably more of them in service amongst list-members.  
And remember that in some municipalities carbs are not an option,  
since it is illegal to remove or modify emissions control equipment.

I converted my dual-carb bus to Bosch L-jetronic FI three years ago,  
and it has run MUCH better since. Dual-carbs  were always a dark  
science to me and keeping worn-out 30-year old carbs in adjustment  
just wasn't working. There is a dearth of air-cooled expertise in  
these parts, and I wanted better gas milage. Parts for them are hard  
to find, and dual-carb replacements for a type4 are not cheap. Single- 
carbs for type4's (weber) are renowned for poor running or economy.

At some time in the future I will probably upgrade to Megasquirt, but  
I wanted to gain familiarity with L-Jet beforehand.

Robt, your message was created and distributed using an "unfixable  
black box", and EVERY single reader of it will also be using these  
same "unfixable black boxes" to read it. It's not like they're new or  
uncommon, and they are not unrepairable. You just need a different  
skill set and some more refined tools, is all.

Mark, Welcome back! I have a friend here in Toronto who is currently  
gathering up the bits to put L-Jetronic FI on his 68 westy. We will  
be sure to let the list know how it works out.


Happy Trails,
