on the underside looking up on the passenger side (lft hand drive) about
two thirds the way to the front there will be a lever about 6 inches long
sticking up, just above the pivot point there will be a ball, press the
cup part of the accell linkage over the ball, put some light grease or
lube like 90weight oil in the cup before pressing it on.

hope this helps
