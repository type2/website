"Running too rich?"



How do you know if your engine is running too rich? I set the idle-I think
to ~850 RPM, but that just sets the idle and not necessarily the fuel
mixture, right?

Kevin,

I'm not sure of the exact procedure to set the idle mixture on your engine. I
was hoping someone more knowledgable would chime in!
