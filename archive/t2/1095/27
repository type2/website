Subject: Thermostat, flaps etc.  with Doghouse

Hi,

I'm trying to install the thermostat flaps on my engine.  Had the bus since 72
and never had'em. Picked up a set at a swap.  Looks like I need a different
connector bar to clear the doghouse cooler tin. Is this correct? Can anyone
point me to a photo of the assembly with doghouse? I looked on Ratwell and
Samba and the archives. Didn't see any appropriate photos.

BTW, one of the flaps has a clip ring about 1 inch dia. attached. What is that
for?
Thanks,
