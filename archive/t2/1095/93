Have a  '67 single cab with a 30 PICT 1 carb.  It has a throttle  positioner
unit that has been disabled but the carb still sits on it with  the 
butterfly
valve in the throttle unit wired open.  My question is  can I just get some
shorter bolts and put my carb back on less the ugly  throttle positioner? or
do I need an adapter of some sort.   Thanks


Ok this sounds like the factory governor unit.  You can sometimes take  it 
out but your carb might hit the generator at the acclerator pump. I have 
seen  spacers that cured that problem if needed.  I personally liked the 
governor  as it kept the engine from ever being over reved when it worked right.
