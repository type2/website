Subject: Re: [T2] Type 1 heater boxes

Hi Kevin,

Beetle heater boxes have the control levers installed on the wrong  
side of the heater box; so they won't line up with the control cables.  
It's not that hard to cut them off and weld them back on the correct  
side, if you've got a welder and the know-how.

Or you can install them as-is and wire them permanently open for  
winter and rewire them shut in the spring.

I have seen asbestos used in type4 heater boxes but I am not familiar  
enough with the type1 boxes to know if they too could contain asbestos.

Happy trails,
