Bull shit.
 
Factory exchangers, including several NOS ones I have right now, have a mat of
asbestos in them.  In point of fact, in the very, very beginning days of this
list, a bunch of us got exchangers replaced for free from a little German
accented heat exchanger fairy working for VWoA who was very worried about
product liability from same.  The guy (who lived in N Va) and whose name
escapes me (it was something LeXXXXXXX, someone smarter than I will recall)
was a neat guy who had been working for VW since the very beginning (40's in
Germany) then for VWoA here since.  I got two sets at the very end of the
"program" one for my '77 Camper, one for my '78 Champagne camper.  I chatted
for several hours with him at the time, and he said they had determined from
the study that "no significant amount of asbestos was liberated from the
exchangers in use, even after 15-20 years of service which I suspect VWoA felt
was OK to protect them from ambulance chasers in the
 future.  The took the exchangers, and the asbestos sealing rings on the
flapper boxes, substituted silicone (Vanagon) sealing rings and new Danish
exchangers.  Now that certainly wouldn't cover having em hot tanked of
course.

There's no fibers in the heat exchangers in any year bus.  There is fibrous
insulation in the flex tubes which is probably not asbestos, and there may
be some rings in them of harder insulation that looks to me like asbestos.
