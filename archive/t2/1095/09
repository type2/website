Subject: Interior

In my continuing search for a camping interior for my 1968 Kombi, I've decided
that I like the 1974/1975 layout enough to give it a try.  Will this setup fit
in my bus?  My concern is the back seat/bed.  Did the height of the engine
compartment change when they switched to the Type-4 motor?  Or is the interior
shape, including rear cargo area, the same for the entire production run
(68-79).

TIA.
