Subject: Removing throttle positioner unit

Have a '67 single cab with a 30 PICT 1 carb.  It has a throttle positioner
unit that has been disabled but the carb still sits on it with the butterfly
valve in the throttle unit wired open.  My question is can I just get some
shorter bolts and put my carb back on less the ugly throttle positioner? or
do I need an adapter of some sort.  Thanks
