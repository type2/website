Subject: VDO Oil Press / Temp gauge...

Hey guys,
 
      Last week, I mentioned an oil temperature / oil pressure gauge that I
bought off eBay which came from a 1978 Porsche 944. I was expecting something
a bit more short, but the gauge that I got is one of those deep pod gauges
that's identical in size to something you might take out of a Porsche 924 or
944.
 
I don't know if it's going to fit. As it stands right now, it looks like it
might be too big for the opening for the clock area. However, I spent $40
bucks on it, so it can't hurt to modify it to see if I can get it to fit.
 
As it stands right now, it's definitely not a direct fit. I think the opening
to the gauge area though might be large enough that it would properly
encompass the entire gauge face.
 
 
 
Todd
