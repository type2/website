Subject: Re: [T2] Removing throtte positioner unit

Hello David, there used to be an aftermarket spacer available to take
the place of throttle positioners (or governors?) check with your parts
suppliers. A couple good reasons to use it are; the cable routing will
be straight and not bent (which accelerates wear), the 30PICT carbs
accelerator pump arm may contact the side of the generator impeding its
movement and lastly, no need pull and possibly strip the studs. Hope
this helps, Timo in Hawaii
