Subject: SVDA & electronic points

Well I just received the SVDA distributor from aircooled, with the pertronix
ignition pre-installed. I also got some new dist gaskets. I pulled the old
one, then pulled the old dist clamp. I then put the clamp on the new one,
put the new gasket on the new one, and installed.

 

It was a tight fit, but not crazy tight.

 

My mechanic helped me time it properly.

 

And away I went..

 

I have to admit, I didn't notice any immediate difference, then again I was
driving through traffic all the way home.

 

Oh yeah, while I was at it, my mechanic help me bend my tailpipe, which had
been shooting the exhaust into the rear bumper instead of under it, leaving
a large black sooty mark on the back of my singlecab.

 

So-the exhause seems nice and cool, after driving across town.

 

I will update about mpg, and driving after using it for a bit, on open
road-outside of traffic areas.

 

Thanks for all your help and suggestions.
