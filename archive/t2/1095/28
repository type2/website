Subject: Re: [T2] DP intake gaskets

I sanded the mating surfaces on the intake manifolds so they are flat and 
smooth, and I installed bushings into the mounting holes so that they fit 
snug on the mounting studs.

Is there an easy way to see if the holes in the intakes match up properly 
with the holes in the heads?

Anything else I should do?

Thanks,

Hi,

I picked up new intake manifold gaskets yesterday. The shop had graphite 
paper
and aluminum gaskets. Cheap enough so I purchased a set of each.

What do you guys recommend using.

My thoughts are this: The DP intake manifolds are a nice large chunk of
aluminum that can draw heat from the heads thereby reducing the temp 
somewhat.
Using the graphite paper gaskets presents a bit more thermal insulation than
the aluminum gaskets. The guy at the counter told me that the aluminum 
gaskets
are what's in original equipment.
