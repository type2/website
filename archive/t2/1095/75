Don, all I'll say is thank your lucky starts you are doing it on a bay (I
assume.)  Could be worse, could be a vanagon working deep in the grungy,
greasy, spider infested pit of the outboard end hub, blind, where someone has
previously destroyed the threads.  Yeah though, need to have everything
meticulously clean before you start.  And heck, if the purple power doesn't
suit you, you can always use some diesel or gas to clean your hands like the
rest of us....   Don't smoke after the gas though.
