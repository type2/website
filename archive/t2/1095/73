Subject: The worst part of replacing CV boots is...

Holding the axle while trying to thread the bolts in when you and the
parts are all covered in grease.

Note to self: Wipe the (-at-)#%$^ things off BEFORE installation, not after.

Second note to self: If you're out of gloves, BUY SOME FIRST. Purple
Power is NOT good for skin.

One axle done, one to go. Sigh. I may let the other one "age" a bit
before I get back under there.
