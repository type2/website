Subject: Re: [T2] Thinking of selling

Paul,

Just an FYI, the '71 front beam won't fit to the '68 and vice versa.  
The beam will have to be left on the '68 and the spindles, booster  
plate, etc, will have to be swapped over from the '71. Not a simple or  
easy task, so it might not be a good selling point unless you do it  
beforehand for the new buyer. I sort of opens a pretty big can o'  
worms trying to get it all sorted. It was one of the more difficult  
complete swaps I have done to date. There are a bunch of location,  
cable, tension and fitment issues that need to be addressed. I had  
fun, but others may not. :)
