Subject: Subject: Happy Thanksgiving to my US friends

Thanks for the greetings Courtney.  While we are thinking of Thanksgiving, I
want to offer thanks for this year's server upgrades, list search development,
and fine moderation by the admins.   This list is still the best because of
their vigilance and work.  How is the treasury?  Do we need to shake the tree
to keep the list solvent?  jon
