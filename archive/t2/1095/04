Subject: RE: [T2] Engine Shipping Costs (was Re: [T2] Wanted: Beater

As an aside, anyone got a sense of cross-country shipping costs for a
turn-key or long-block type-1 engine?  And/or what the cheapest shipping
method is?  (Greyhound?  USPS? UPS?)

In the spring of '09 I had a long block shipped from Seattle, Wa. to
Syracuse, NY.  The company my builder used was Estes and as I recall he
charged me $175 to ship it (180 lbs.).  I do not know whether or not Jerry
at NWCR incorporated the price into the build or that was the actual price.
Hope this helps.

Tom
