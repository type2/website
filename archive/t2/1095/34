Subject: Re: [VB] DP intake gaskets

Hi Chris,
	Interesting that you though of the insulating issues with metal vs  
fiber gaskets where the intake manifolds bolt up to the heads.  Gene  
Berg use to recommend not using anti-seize on spark plugs because it  
would insulate the plugs from the heads....
