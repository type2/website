Subject: Re: [T2] How much HP difference

HP Measurements have changed over the years.  Specifically, ~1972 US
automakers switched from SAE Gross to SAE Net when advertising engine power.
From Wikipedia:

SAE horsepower

SAE gross horsepower

Prior to the 1972 model year, American automakers rated and advertised their
engines in brake horsepower (bhp), frequently referred to as SAE gross
horsepower, because it was measured in accord with the protocols defined in
SAE standards J245 and J1995. As with other brake horsepower test protocols,
SAE gross hp was measured using a stock test engine, generally running with
few belt-driven accessories and sometimes fitted with long tube (test headers)
in lieu of the OEM exhaust manifolds. The atmospheric correction standards for
barometric pressure, humidity and temperature for testing were relatively
idealistic.

SAE net horsepower

In the United States, the term bhp fell into disuse in 1971-72, as automakers
began to quote power in terms of SAE net horsepower in accord with SAE
standard J1349. Like SAE gross and other brake horsepower protocols, SAE Net
hp is measured at the engine's crankshaft, and so does not account for
transmission losses. However, the SAE net hp testing protocol calls for
standard production-type belt-driven accessories, air cleaner, emission
controls, exhaust system, and other power-consuming accessories. This produces
ratings in closer alignment with the power produced by the engine as it is
actually configured and sold.

Shaft horsepower

Shaft horsepower (shp) is the power delivered to the propeller shaft of a ship
or an aircraft powered by a piston engine or a turbine engine (the combination
of turbine engine and propeller commonly called a turboprop).  This may be
measured from the indicated horsepower given a standard figure for the losses
in the transmission (typical figures are around 10%). This measure is uncommon
in the automobile industry, because drivetrain losses can be significant.

Effective (True, wheel) hp

Effective horsepower (EHP), True horsepower (THP) or wheel horsepower (whp) is
the power converted to useful work. In the case of a road vehicle this is the
power actually turned into forward motion as measured on a chassis
dynamometer. Power available at the road is generally 10% to 20% less than the
engine's bhp rating due to coastdown losses, most of which are due to the
vehicle's rubber tires rather than true transmission losses. Front-wheeldrive
cars (provided a transverse engine layout is used) suffer slightly lower
coastdown losses due to the absence of the beveled crown and pinion gears used
to change the drive direction in the back axle of a RWD car.

Since it is Friday... if a VW engine has, as stated in the
Manual..say..67HP..where is that HP measured..at the flywheel..or?..and if
that engine is placed in an aircraft for power, (figuring in air temps up
there, and other 'non ground' variables), does it still make the same HP at
'work' in the air?  CWBQ   (crappy weather bored Question)!  Cheers
