I got a new 4 cylinder in my life, picked it up on Monday.  This will be the
only posting I do about it, I know it is only parked next to a Westfalia.

The guy had dropped the price from $1200 to $850 because nobody could get it
started, I got him to accept $500, but only if he let me work on it in his
driveway and I was able to drive it away.  All I did was replace the spark
plugs and it fired right away and it was mine.

So far I have replaced the motor mounts because one was busted and replaced
the clutch master-cylinder.  It needs a 4 speed transmission because 4th is
hosed and I am torn between running to Seattle to get a free one from a
friend that replaced his with a 5 speed or paying $50 for the one down the
street from me, I think the $50 down the street will save me some money.
