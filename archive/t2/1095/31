yes, with the doghouse you need a different horizontal bar between the right
and left flaps.
I found plenty of pics in the samba gallery.

Hi,
I'm trying to install the thermostat flaps on my engine.  Had the bus since
2
nd never had'em. Picked up a set at a swap.  Looks like I need a different
onnector bar to clear the doghouse cooler tin. Is this correct?
