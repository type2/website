Subject: elusive seal needed

Hey folks, I am in need of the seal that goes on the engine access panel
inside of a '78 bus.  This is the door that is in the rear cargo area inside
the bus over the engine that you can open to work on the engine from the top. 
I have checked every vendor that I can think of to no avail.  Does anyone know
where I can get a new one of these seals?  many thanks, Greg
