Subject: RE: [T2] Sorry - Coming in Late on Asbestos - A Question

There's no fibers in the heat exchangers in any year bus.  There is fibrous
insulation in the flex tubes which is probably not asbestos, and there may
be some rings in them of harder insulation that looks to me like asbestos.
They were in my '69.  But there's no asbestos batting anywhere in there, and
the hard stuff poses no risk unless you grind it and whiff the dust.  Just
because it's asbestos doesn't mean it's dangerous.

When I first got my bus, I had a shop that turned out to be not-so-hot
rebuild my engine. They hot-tanked the oily heat exchangers. For the next
couple of years, every time I opened the defroster, little fibers scattered
all over the dashboard. Now this was a '79 - was that asbestos? There was a
definite layer of insulation just inside the sheet metal... Was I breathing
asbestos all that time?
