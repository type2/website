I think for the most part the interior of the basic VW bus is the same with
the exception of hold downs on the cargo floor for whatever VW was putting
in that year. I have an extra "Z" bed and some cabinets from a '78 Westy if
you want them for the cost of shipping.

I live 26 miles south of Boston in the town of Abington

In my continuing search for a camping interior for my 1968 Kombi, I've
decided that I like the 1974/1975 layout enough to give it a try.  Will this
setup fit in my bus?  My concern is the back seat/bed.  Did the height of
the engine compartment change when they switched to the Type-4 motor?  Or is
the interior shape, including rear cargo area, the same for the entire
production run (68-79).

TIA.
