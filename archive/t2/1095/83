I think my mileage has been around 16mpg. I have a single carb. This is for
my '69 singelcab.

I'll see what happens to my mileage after the recent adjustments. I keep a
log of gas fill-ups and mileage.

Pull a spark plug and check if it's sooty or not. Either that, or check your

gas mileage; you should be getting 18-22 mpg. What is this on, fuel 
injected, or twin carbs??
