Subject: Sorry - Coming in Late on Asbestos - A Question

When I first got my bus, I had a shop that turned out to be not-so-hot rebuild my engine. They hot-tanked the oily heat exchangers. For the next couple of years, every time I opened the defroster, little fibers scattered all over the dashboard. Now this was a '79 - was that asbestos? There was a definite layer of insulation just inside the sheet metal... Was I breathing asbestos all that time?
