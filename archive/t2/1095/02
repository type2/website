 Hi Jeremy,

I own a '78 Champagne Westy too.
Is there any info you need?

Did Karl ever share his list with anyone on this list?

We just came into a 78 Champagne Westy and was just curious where it fit in
his picture.

I know every time one was mentioned Karl asked for the production date and
last 6 numbers of the VIN.

Thanks!

Jeremy
