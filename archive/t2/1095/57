I believe the standard approach is to time the 009 so that the maximum
advance is 30 BTDC, then let the idle advance fall wherever it wants to.
Mind you, as an experiment when I had a weber progressive, I converted
my SVDA distributor to a 009 by blocking off the vacuum. I went about
100m and pulled over to change it back again!

I would even consider getting a good secondhand stock distributor if you
don't have the "readies" to get a new one.
