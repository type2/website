Hi Courtney,

The side of my carb is stamped : Solex H30/31 PICT. Thanks for any tips on
tuning this.

I used to have a 28 PICT on my old bus, it was the carb that was on the
engine when I got it. When I needed a new engine the engine builder
convinced me that this was not a good carb to run on a bus engine, as it
would run too lean, and overheat the engine. So I gave it away. After having
VW's for about 10 years, I am learning which things are worth hanging on to.
I kind of wish I hung on to that 28 PICT, it gave me the best mpg, but I
guess that is what the engine builder meant.

Kevin, what carb is this? It will have numbers on the side of the carb float

bowl, such as 30PICT or 32PICT or 34PICT. Let me know, and I'll tell you how

to tune it. If it is a 28 to 32 PICT Solex carb, they are wonderful carbs 
and so easy to work with. I have all the specs on them if you need it. My 
old bug still runs on it's original 28PICT; the carb is 40 years old, and is

still idling like a baby.
