Subject: Thinking of selling

I have a 68 Type 2 Westfalia and I am thinking of selling it.  I have a later
71 with a bad body to go with it so it can have the newer suspension and
brakes.  I am in Central CA.  Any suggestions on method and price?
The 68 runs good, it has a new tent, very little rust but a few dings here and
there.
