Subject: wtb 74 Bus rear bumper

I need to replace my rear bumper
My 74 Camper is going in to the body shop in  a few days to repair the
collision damage.. and I'd like to have a bumper ready when they get to the
paint stage
if you have a 74 style rear bumper,, frame brackets would be a bonus!
insurance is coughing up some cash... but not carte blanche [blank check]
