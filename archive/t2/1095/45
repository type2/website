I had to sand the intake surfaces to smooth them off. Did so with fine sand
paper on a granite flat.


An inexpensive flat surface for these type/sizes of projects can be had by
mounting a polished granite tile in/on a wood base.  I mount them on a layer
of duct seal so they can be easily replaced if they become unserviceable. 12
inch square tiles are less than $5 at the local big box home improvement
store.  Unserviceable windshields out of older, 707, DC-8/10, C130, heavy
aircraft also make excellent, durable, flat surfaces.  Ask around surplus
operations.  Modern heavy ac w/s are curved, we're in the "bay window" era,
finally.  jon
