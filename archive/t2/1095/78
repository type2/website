Subject: re:running rich

Thanks for the tips.

 

I got to spend a little quality time with my singlecab today.

 

I have pulled the spark plugs, they were fouled to the extent that I think
would mean "running rich".

I put new ones in. I'm not sure how to tell when a spark plug needs to be
replaced, and I don't think I've ever replaced them on this engine..any
suggestions on who you check your spark plugs?

 

I tried to adjust the carbs as per some instructions I found on the type 2
library, muir guide etc. I think I did it correctly. It sounds like it is
running well, but I'll see tomorrow when I try to start it from being cold.

 

I also got an oil change in, and took a look at the windshield washer
system. I pressurized the tank, and fluid just started squirting out at the
windshield, which makes me thing that the windshield washer switch is
broken/stuck in the 'spray' position. Any ideas on how to diagnose this
wiper switch?
