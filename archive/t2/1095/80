Hello,

I was checking the oil on my bus yesterday and found a grey, platic cover resting on the engine.
I fell from something, but I cannot identify it.

I have a couple pictures of the cover here:

For reference, it's a Type IV engine.
Also, the right hose leading from the blower down to the right heat exhanger was severed near the bottom.
I can only guess that the cover came loose from where it belongs, hit the alternator belt (or some other moving component) and that forced it through the hose.

Any help identifying the part is most appreciated!

Thanks,

Josh
