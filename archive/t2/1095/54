Subject: Idle speed gone wild -34PICT-3 - EASY solution

NOT SEEN on some of the parts diagrams is an O-ring on the idle speed/ 
bypass adjusting screw - the larger of the two adjusting screws on  
this carb.

My idle had crept up to almost 3000 rpm on a short trip this weekend.   
I used the adjusting screw to bring it under control a couple of times  
but it would eventually end up idling at a very high rpm.

When I took the screw out I noticed a very flattened O-ring which I  
replaced with  a $0.49 one from the plumbing department of the local  
Ace Hardware store.  Now it's sufficiently snug to keep from vibrating  
out - I hope.  I'm also hoping that the worn O-ring was also "leaking  
air" and that my carb will be better adjusted now.
