Kevin, what carb is this? It will have numbers on the side of the carb float 
bowl, such as 30PICT or 32PICT or 34PICT. Let me know, and I'll tell you how 
to tune it. If it is a 28 to 32 PICT Solex carb, they are wonderful carbs 
and so easy to work with. I have all the specs on them if you need it. My 
old bug still runs on it's original 28PICT; the carb is 40 years old, and is 
still idling like a baby.
