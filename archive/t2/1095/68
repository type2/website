Yes, Idle speed only adjusts how far the flap opens up. The idle jet sets
the fuel metering. You could think of idle speed setting as adjusting how
much air is going into the engine and the idle jet as adjusting how rich or
lean.

How do you know if your engine is running too rich? I set the idle-I think
to ~850 RPM, but that just sets the idle and not necessarily the fuel
mixture, right?
