Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Trouble Timing a 1973 Dual Carb Setup w/ SVDA

Originally, the carbs for DVDA and SVDA systems were different part numbers,
the major difference being more vacuum fittings on the DVDA models, less on
the SVDA models.  VW essentially over the years superseded them all to one
carburetor to use with both DVDA and SVDA, you just plug up the fittings not
needed.  Based on my carburetor model database from VW, jetting (Air
Correction/Emulsion, Main and Idle Pilot) was essentially the same.  Inside
chambering may have been slightly different to accomodate emissions control
for the market they were sold in.  Volume Control set-ups on the bench and
fine tuning while running was virtually identical.

I must also note that the vacuum advance signal for the 30PICT-3, H30/31PICT
and 34PICT 3 & 4 carburetors are identical regardless of the distributor
being used.  It is different enough that I don't recommend using the SVDA
with 28PICT's, 30PICT 1 or 2 carburetors because a higher vacuum signal is
generated by the carb to be used with the vacuum only advance, such as used
on the 113-905-205 T distributor.  It pulls the advance too quick on the
SVDA because of the different design of the smaller vacuum can on the SVDA
and plays hell with abrupt acceleration from a standing start or when
passing - just as bad as a 009.

YMMV
