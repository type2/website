Never saw asbestos inside the boxes (shouldn't be there anyway, as it would mess up the heat transfer off the manifolds) but about half I've seen have had the blanket around them...  I suspect it was placed there for additional insulation to stop the heat loss from the bare metal. I was told the repop ones don't have the blankets, but...  as to a hazard...  

What I was told (by numerous sources) is that while asbestos IS a hazard when it its fibers are floating in the air (like the old brake lining dust, or when they cut sheets of it with a radial saw) when it is still intact it is NOT hazardous.  What I did with my 71 T1 (which had the blankets) was to cover them with sheet metal (fairly thin aluminum) and (as I remember) banded or wired them in place.  I did that to protect the Asbestos from getting "dinged" which would have made the particles on the dinged and/or broken edges "friable" - loose and able to go airborne.  

I *DO* know that bug blew air that was hotter than Habanero Hades...  Had I the means to find asbestos cloth (definitely unobtanium) I would have not only done the exhaust on my 77 bus but also the duct going frontwards.  I almost did that with fiberglass cloth - a co-worker wrapped her Heat Duct in fiberglass insulation ('68 3 seater) and the defrost air was most certainly hot; also, the bus was not unpleasant in the winter, which would have been a huge improvement!

BTW, I am jealous -  I actually wanted to go with the Euro Type 1 setup on my 77 (knew someone who could build workable tins for it if I couldn't find them), but was told it would be too gutless with the Delux Westy and all the cr(-at-)... er... "stuff" I hauled in it.Sad, as the reason I finally sold it was I couldn't afford to keep replacing top end parts - 4 dropped seats in 2 years killed it for me.  Sure miss that bus - it was literally (a VERY comfy) home away from home!

My '73 Westy has a European engine conversion and uses the Type 1 engine with
the correct engine tins.  Are original heater boxes from a Type 1 in good
shape safe to use. Do they contain asbestos?
Thanks.
