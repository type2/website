Sorry if I mixed my timing advice up with advice about ditching the 009!
:)

The important aspect of centrifugal advance is not where it is at idle
but where maximum advance is set to. To do this, loosen off the
distributor clamp, point your trusty timing light at the scale and
observe where the timing advances to when the revs are at around 3000.
This should be 30 deg or thereabouts. You may find that a slightly
different value is better for your engine. Then tighten up the
distributor clamp and recheck the maximum advance to make sure it didn't
get bumped after you set it!

HTH!

Martin.
