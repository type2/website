As the list seems quite quiet, as perhaps well it should be over 
Thanksgiving, I'll chime in.

First, the old spark plug test is the simplest and best way to determine if 
you are running rich.  Pull a plug.  It should be a nice sort of light gray 
if all is well you are running right.  If it is black and sooty you are 
probably running rich.

Second, adjusting the mixture.  On Solex carbs there is an idle mixture 
adjust screw usually set at the factory at about 2-1/2 turns out.  When the 
engine is warm and idling, you can fiddle with this mixture adjust screw 
until your idle is at its fest speed, then back off a little, and you will 
have a pretty good mixture.

In addition, there are several jets that control fuel flow and add air in 
the carb.  The most important for your purposes is the main jet, located 
inside and at the bottom of the fuel bowl.  Reducing the diameter of the 
main jet by replacing it with a smaller diameter jet will lean out your 
mixture.  Obviously, replacing the jet with a larger one will make it 
richer.  The diameter of the jet is stamped on it.

Also, running rich consider may not be the carb. If you are running a paper 
air cleaner that is fouled, you may not be getting optimum air intake.  Or 
if it is an oil-bath filter be sure that the weighted lever operates freely. 
Finally, be sure your choke is opening all the way when the engine is warm. 
You can do this by removing the air cleaner and looking, or by checking the 
series of ratcheted steps on the side of the carb, making sure that the 
choke has opened as far as it can open.

Also, check your timing.  If your timing is too retarded you may not be 
getting a full burn and that can show up as fouled plugs and excess carbon.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,

John Rogers
