Subject: How much HP difference

Since it is Friday... if a VW engine has, as stated in the
Manual..say..67HP..where is that HP measured..at the flywheel..or?..and if
that engine is placed in an aircraft for power, (figuring in air temps up
there, and other 'non ground' variables), does it still make the same HP at
'work' in the air?  CWBQ   (crappy weather bored Question)!  Cheers
