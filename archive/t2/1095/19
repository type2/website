I stand corrected then.  My experience is with Type 1 motors, and I've never
seen anything fibrous in there.

hmm,, I think you are mistaken.
VW recalled the heater boxes.. or flex tubes because of asbestos.. and the
ring that joined them was asbestos.. they went to "rubber" rings for seals
after that..

and ,, the heater boxes I have hear are lined with a tin foil and asbestos
liner.. and once that liner gets a rip in it. the tinfoil, and the fibres
blow all over the dash.. sometimes very annoying as the tinfoil gets caught
in the louvers

afaik... jamie
