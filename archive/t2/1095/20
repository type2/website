Subject: Re: [T2] How much HP difference

Good question.  I've always assumed it was crank horsepower and not 
wheel horsepower.  This because of having put a good-condition 2-liter 
engine on a chassis dyno which measured it at about 56hp at the wheels. 
    That's in line with the generally-accepted figure of 15% loss at the 
wheels.  Anyone know differently?

As for "in the air" HP, I would imagine that altitude would be the 
biggest factor in power production since there is so much less air at 
n-thousand feet.
