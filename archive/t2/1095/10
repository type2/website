I've even seen that bed transplanted to split window buses. I don't
think it will give you any trouble.

 In my continuing search for a camping interior for my 1968 Kombi, I've

 that I like the 1974/1975 layout enough to give it a try.  Will this setup

 in my bus?  My concern is the back seat/bed.  Did the height of the engine
 compartment change when they switched to the Type-4 motor?  Or is the
interior
 shape, including rear cargo area, the same for the entire production run
 (68-79).
