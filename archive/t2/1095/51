I'm willing to bet it should say "fits '73-'79" and someone wasn't  
paying attention when they put the description together.  Much of an  
annoyance that kind of thing is, it happens...

Wish I could confirm that it's right, but vagcat.com (online ETKA)  
doesn't show teh part number anymore, and I've got no idea if ETKA  
itself still lists the P/N because I don't have it.  That seal  
certainly *looks* right in the oeveedub picture.

Tried sending this once and it got kicked back for too much quoted  
material.  So I trimmed the quoted stuff a bit and added more text ..  
including this.  :-)
