This is an easy one. Buy either an extra CV bolt, or go hardware hunting for
one that is just a bit longer. Grind off the head, and make a stud out of
it. Thread it into the top hole, and just hang the joint on that one stud,
while you thread in the others. Pull the stud, and put in the last bolt.

Relative piece of cake. Just make sure to leave the stud long enough to get
it out :-)
