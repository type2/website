Is there an easy way to see if the holes in the intakes match up properly
with the holes in the heads?




 Take some thicker paper or even cereal box cardboard.  Cut this down to 
about
bottom manifold size.  Get some bolts same size as the studs on the head, 
and
matching nuts.  With a sharp knife or exacto carefully cut the 
paper/cardboard
with the mounting, and pin holes in the manifolds.  Next bolt the paper to
each manifold with previously mentioned bolts/nut and then again carefully 
by
feel cut the paper/cardboard openings at the bottom of the manifolds. 
Pencil
the paper/cardboard on the topside to match manifold outer shape.  Remove 
the
templates, BUT mark each with which manifold, front/rear, and which side 
down.
Then compare each head to the template from each manifold.
