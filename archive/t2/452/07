   Why not clean the crud out by drilling out the cable housing, and fix the
problem? Take the old cable, and flatten one end by laying it on a flat hard
surface, like a vice. Then hit it with a hammer till you have a nice flat
1/4 inch wide end. Chuck the other end in a drill, and slowly feed it in the
housing while drilling, spraying with WD 40 from time to time.
    When the housing is clear, be sure and grease the new cable to prevent
it from happening again.
