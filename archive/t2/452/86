Subject: what type oil is everyone using?? grade??

hello,
after using a regular grade 40w oil in my bus to sorta
flush out the engine after sitting for 7 yrs, im ready
after 150miles of driving to change the oil again..

just curious as to what works best in a bus engine,
its a stock 1600 and i live in california where the
weather has been 90+, the winters arent winters and is
more like spring in most midwest and eastern areas.

what is the best oil to run??
i've heard straight 40W, but would like others advice
and the feedback on what they've run for years etc.


thanx,
rob
