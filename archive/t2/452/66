Subject: Re: [T2] Whistle While You Work

When I had my engine swapped, I asked the guy to keep my original dual carb 
setup (it's a 72 van and I swapped the 72 1700cc for a 76 2L engine) so that 
I could save a few bucks.  Unfortunately, since the carbs and the engine had 
*never* been worked on in the van's 33 years of existence, taking the carbs 
off and putting them on the "new" engine caused them to ... not function so 
well any more.  Whereas before the swap, my carbs were running alright - if 
a little rich.

What I'm getting to is that after the engine swap, my carbs started 
whistling like crazy.  It was quiet and not too annoying as you say at idle, 
and a little more noticeable at speed.  However, more annoying than the 
sound was the lack of power!  I swapped the old carbs for a brand new 2 bbl 
single carb and power returned, whistling stopped.

Mind you ... not too much power, but what can I ask for?  Hope this helps 
somehow - I'd check for a vacuum leak in your carbs.

peace,
