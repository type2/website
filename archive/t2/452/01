Subject: gas smell for me too

I have a 79 camper and I have become accustomed to the smell of gas when I turn it off after parking...Muir mentions it but none of the suggestions really apply as I have checked them all...is this normal?

P.S.- is the EGR warning light supposed to light up with the others upon start-up? Because mine does not.
 
P.P.S. - I usually have to start the van about four times to get it actually running without dying. This is my first aircooled VW and a fellow enthusist mentioned that it was normal...I just want to make sure I am not looking at a problem here...I have only had it for about a month so am still trying to learn what it is normal and not...any help or comments would be appreciated
