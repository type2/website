Yes, it is probably normal.  The problem is that with your gauge it is nearly impossible to tell how rich your are running.  It could be 14-to-1 or 10-to-1.  Your O2 sensor is only good at detecting stoich (14.7-to-1) and has no resolution on either side of that.  It is okay to run at 14.7-to-1 at idle and very light throttle but you should run richer than that if your engine is under any significant load.  Supposedly 12.8 is ideal for power production.
