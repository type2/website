Is it possible to access & replace the fuel sending unit this way too?
Or does it require a motor drop & gas tank removal as specified in the
Haynes manual?
My sending unit doesn't work & I just use mileage.    I was waiting till I
have to drop the motor for some work... but as luck would have it, she's
running strong. ;0)
78 Westy stock FI &  automatic.

Thanks

btw:  that's a great comment:  "mongolian circus contortionist"
