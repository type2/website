It certainly does.

I guess the one on my distributor must have been installed incorrectly 
by a PO.  I decided to pull the distributor after fishing around for my 
dropped condenser screw and feeling a pool of oil and fragments of 
brittle rubber sealing material all over underneath the distributor 
body (sigh, should have just pulled it in the first place; I would have 
never lost that condenser screw).
