Subject: Westy Parts compatability

Hey newbie to the list here, I tried the archive search but couldn't seem to
enter the right search string so I am turning to the list.  My question is
will the entire Westy top set up (cargo, canvas & main top) from a 1978 fit
on a 1979 Westy??  Any help would be great.
