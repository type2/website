I liked the signature comment:

**** If God had intended us to be vegetarians, He wouldn't have
made animals out of meat! ********

While it's still Friday:
My invention idea is this: vegeatrians are always trying to make veggie 
versions of meat products....tofu dogs, soy burgers...........why not make 
meat versions of vegetables? Then carnivorres could make an imitation carrot 
from ground beef, and pseudo-celery from kielbasa. It'd be great. All of a 
sudden meat eaters would be eating their vegetables, and everyone would be 
healthy!
