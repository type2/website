Colby:

First, ditch Muir in favor of a manual that applies to your vehicle.  Here's
a couple:

http://busdepot.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=BENTLEYV279
http://busdepot.com/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=HAY226

It's not normal to smell gasoline.  It suggests at least a couple of things:

1)Leak in the fuel system.  Find and fix instanter!!
2)Grommets for breather system on top of fuel tank are rotten.

Yes, the EGR light should come on.  At least, mine does in my '82 Westy.

An engine in sound mechanical condition and in good tune should start and
stay running on the first try.

> I have a 79 camper and I have become accustomed to the smell of gas when I
turn it off after parking...Muir mentions it but none of the suggestions
really apply as I have checked them all...is this normal?
> P.S.- is the EGR warning light supposed to light up with the others upon
start-up? Because mine does not.
 > P.P.S. - I usually have to start the van about four times to get it
actually running without dying. This is my first aircooled VW and a fellow
enthusist mentioned that it was normal...I just want to make sure I am not
looking at a problem here...I have only had it for about a month so am still
trying to learn what it is normal and not...any help or comments would be
appreciated
