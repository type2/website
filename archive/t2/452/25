Subject: RE: [T2] solex 2 barrel

Dan,

I have a Solex 2 barrel carb also.  It is in very good shape.  I ran it for
a while on my new 1835, ran strong.  Then it started running beaucoups rich
and fouled the plugs like hell.  Couldn't figure it out.  Maybe stuck needle
valve or float or something--or maybe stuck choke.  Mark's guy at Salem
Import couldn't figure it out (and I didn't have time or motivation to ask
him to take it apart), but they got me going again anyway.  I had to promise
to rig up the Baby Dells when I got home.

Anyway I do have some parts that came with it but not sure what, anyway it
is a confusing carb.  Not doing anyone any good in my basement but I might
put it back on ebarf from whence it came.

A Weber 32/36 MIGHT fit on your manifold.  I have a manifold with heat
risers but that's for a T1 and does not apply.  Personally I like the Weber
on my BMW but it has a coolant-heated manifold so no icing.

You can get a Weber on ebay for around 50 bucks, or find one in a junkyard
and rebuild it.  I have never found out what car the Solex progressive was
original on, does anybody????  Maybe there is documentation somewhere.

If you think you could come up with $350 then get a good used set of dual
Dellorto DRLA's off thesamba. . . WAY better setup.
