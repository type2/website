according to someone on the bug_pack, i forget who, but someone who had done
it, you can get the tank out without pulling the motor. you have to remove
the filter housing etc (not the runners) and disconnect the rear engine
support so the motor will droop down a bit (on a jack of course).

then you do some mongolian contortions and get the tank out. like i said,
this is hearsay, but i believe it can be done this way if one wishes to.
