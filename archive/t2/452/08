Folks,

I recently decoded that I would replace my ragged old paper
glove box with a new one...even if it was plastic.

So, last week I received the new one and was looking it over...looks ok 
and I will put felt or something in it to keep things from rattling.

But!  I turned it over and there on the back side was the infamous
sticker saying it was made by EMPI...ok...big deal, except I got a real 
kick out of the warning label that we are all used to seeing by 
now....remember, this is on a plastic glovebox....

"that is *not* legal in the state of California except for offroad
and racing vehicles".

You all know the line by now..I have probably misquoted it a little...

Maybe it isn't funny to anyone else, but I am still grinning about 
it...what is this world coming too?!

Cheers, dave

P.S. and I will definitely be using "on the road"<grin>.
