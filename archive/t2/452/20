Joel is right about the access to the sending unit.

Without cutting into the luggage shelf/cargo area in the back of the
bus, the only way to get to that sender is to drop the motor to get
access to the unit.  It's a double edged sword.  You really hate to
take the time to drop the motor to get to a silly little sending
unit, and you really hate to cut into the bus too.

The place to cut is between the rear bench seat and the inside hatch
motor access, centered off of the hatch access.  The PO hackjob that
was done to my poor unsuspecting bus is about a 6 x 5 inch cut.
I've seen this done a variety of ways, the neatest of which,
somebody fabbed in a rubber seal with a fabbed access plate that
clipped into place with cotter pins.  It was made from a donor
vehicle evidentally and fitted almost seamless.  Dunno why VW didn't
put an access panel there in the 70's buses, they did on the mexi
buses later on though.
