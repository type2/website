Subject: Pre-74 poptop available

Hey yall,
I have run across a pre 74 fiberglass top and
having a 78 westy, I have no use for.
If anybody needs one, let me know,
I would rather trade for it than sell, possibly
for late bay stuff, make an offer.  The canvass is still on it
and is in ok shape.  I am in western Mass
phone number is 413 586 4924
or email me at willisbsmooth(-at-)msn.com
