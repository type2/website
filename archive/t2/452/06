Subject: RE: Parts Needed

 Hello,

     I'm looking for a couple items, to fit a 1985 Westphalia. If anyone has
these for-sale let me know, plus price and location.
    I'm in need of a complete roof vent or as some call it, a skylight, to
fit the pop top. I need everything as the PO removed the old one and patched
the opening with a piece of plywood.
    I also need a brown cabinet door lock, to fit the rear most
cabinet/closet, although they look to be all the same.
    Finally the three front (or it may be only one) curtains to fit both
doors and windshield. They are light brown colored. I can send pictures of
the other curtains for color and pattern comparison.
    Thanks, let me know.

 Howard
