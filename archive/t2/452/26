Subject: Childs Cot Poles Needed

Anybody got a spare set of poles for a '68-'72 childs cot they would like to
sell?  Someone decided they needed mine more than I did a couple weekends
ago.  The weird thing is that they didn't even take the fabric, just the
poles...  Actually, I could probably reposition the clips and use the later
poles instead.  Let me know and we can work out the details.

Thanks in advance,
