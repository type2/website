Subject: Friday - George, Washington

Anyone heading to the Dead show at the Gorge in George, Washington this weekend?  Hoping to take the bus, but being 300 miles away and nagging problems with the distributor may mean I have to take another vehicle.  I am desperatley leaning towards taking the bus and will probably do so if I can get everything sorted out by Sunday morning.  If you are on the AIRS list in Northern Idaho or Eastern Washington you may be hearing from me.  If you are there, look for a blue '72 with Montana plates in the lot - there will be a hot burrito waiting for you...
Enjoy the weekend.
