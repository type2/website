Well.... by way of follow-up, today, since I wasn't doing anything but
being "the chainsaw fairy"[1], I stopped by a VW dealership and ordered
the gasket.  When I asked about the gasket for a '78 bus, it was listed as
NLA.  When I asked for the gasket for an '82 bus (same air dist box, same
throttle body casting) they had one listed for $4.  It was special order,
but it *was* listed.  I did order one. I did not get the part number, but
the new gasket will be in Tuesday and I will report the gasket part number
and comparability to an old gasket I dug out of the parts stash[2].

[1] The chainsaw fair comes around the day after a hurricane with his/her
chainsaw and cuts up the trees that the storm has felled.  The chainsaw
contractor charges $100-1000 depending on your desperation level.  The
chainsaw fairy cuts up the tree without asking anything, unamerican
sociallist that he is :-)  Three people got a visit from the chainsaw
fairy today... more tomorrow!

[2]  One of these days, as I get closer to moving, I have *got* to
disperse this stash.  Mostly it is "good used" stuff I have pulled and
saved, but the limit is that I *WILL NOT* ship.  The price will be free,
but you are going to hav to (a) pick it up or (b) talk a DC-area listee
inot picking it up to ship to you.  Sorry, but I am bad at UPS at the best
of times, right now it is just out of the question.
