Maybe it's referring to the dash light circuit?  Many radios have a 
wire for that so you can dim the display, or it may want to know when 
the dash lights come on so it can auto-dim the display for nighttime 
use.  You could probably also hook it to the taillight circuit if it's 
for the latter purpose.
