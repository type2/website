Subject: Re: [T2] gas smell for me too

Chris -
Just to be specific - assuming my 78 and the 79 are the same in this 
respect: the tall black vertical canister (going from memory) behind the 
passenger taillight is a vapor canister? I didint' know that! Shame on me. 
Also - how available are the filler necks - I've checked my usual vendors 
but didn't find one. Do you know if installation instructions (besides 
Bentley) exist, and how difficult was it?

Thanks
Mat

However you have fuel injection -or you are supposed to. If you smell fuel 
then you have a leak that needs attention. Either your gas cap or the gas 
tank venting system is open to the atmosphere or you have a fuel leak -- 
that is a hose that has failed. I would start with checking the vent system 
and the fuel neck. My vent system had a couple tiny hoses behind the 
firewall that were rotted away. I also had  a torn fuel neck. Be sure to see 
if the vapor canister behind the passenger side taillight is intact and 
connected.
