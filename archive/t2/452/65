It is called the pintle cover.

I would have the injectors rebuilt at a shop, tho. I'll rebuild darn near
anything, but I think injectors are best left to a specialist, there are
some specialized tools and machines needed. If the pintle covers are so bad
as to need replacing, there might be other issues with the injectors also. I
have never seen injector rebuild kits - this is such a specialized area that
I doubt if type of kit would be in demand by anyone other than injector
shops.
