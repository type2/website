Subject: RE: [T2] gas smell for me too

Filler Necks require patience but are perfectly do-able in an hour
or so of free time.  The hassle with those things is pulling the
battery, pulling the air filter/afm if you are injected, popping the
pie plate, unclipping and removing the computer (again if you're
injected)....
doing this will give you room enough to get your arm in there like
some mongolian circus contortionist and pull the tube off of the
filler neck.  Don't forget to take the screws off of the retaining
ring under the gas cap so that the body of the bus will release the
filler neck.  It really is a simple procedure,.. just a PITA is all.
