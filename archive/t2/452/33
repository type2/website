Folks,

Don't forget that there may be a lot of people off the list today
that are on the east coast.

I can still send mail, but am having to read it from the t2 library pages.
(my server and about 400 others are down... at the data center in eastern 
Pennsylvania...1,000's of miles away).

My bus however is happy and safe at home in the shop(mandatory bus 
content).

I am sure that the list admins are watching bounced outbound mail
from all over the place.

Cheers, dave
