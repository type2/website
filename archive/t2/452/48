Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Mechanical Fuel Pump 1973

For a new diaphragm, you can buy a rebuild kit for a Porshce 356/912 fuel 
pump. About $60 for the kit the last I checked a few years ago, but the 
diaphragm is the only thing of use for the VW pump. I got an OEM Pierburgh 
pump from Bus Depot last year. When they were last available through the 
dealers many years ago they were $160. It is the best way to solve fuel 
delivery problems for 20+ more years at any price, compared to the other 
junk pump ideas floating around. Be sure to order 2 gaskets. The pump only 
came with one and you need another for the spacer. I coat these gaskets 
with a thin thin thin coat of Aviation Permatex. Don't forget to pack some 
grease into the lever area.

If you can't find a new pump here, seek out Britain. They had dual carb 
T-11's through the 70's and they all used the same pump, not just three 
years like in the US. I would look there also for new original carbs, also 
unique to this Bus production. As well, one of the bolts that holds that 
pump is the same size 12 point triple square drive as the CV bolts, but 
with a thinner head. It is unique in the word of machines and fits nowhere 
else in the automotive world that I am aware of.
