I have the new gasket (025 133 073 ) installed on my throttle body
right now.  I ordered the 073A part from Bus Boys and they sent me
this.  They look different as you can see in these pictures.
073 Has more ribs on the outer part of the seal. Improved design?
It appears to seal well.  I've verified vacuum and readings seem good.
I'll leave Mr. Dolan to give the final word though.
