Subject: carb rebuilt still ran bad sputtered etc until I simply>

my carb was rebuilt still ran bad etc, never was able
to keep it idling right, never had the power it
should.

I had a guy look at it, he simply cracked open a jet
on the side and WHAM!! you could here the difference,
then we shut her down. Pulled the jet and kinda
crimped the treads to allow more intake of air..

man o man what a difference, no more popping on
deceleration, more power, runs cooler !!! 

im surely going to fine tune everything, put
everything back on, trim, lenses etc this weekend..

its so fun to drive it now.. I'm really thinking im
going to keep it..

peace,
