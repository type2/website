Subject: Type 1 transmission codes??

I have an IRS transmission and I'm trying to figure out what it is. Just
where are the code no's on these trannies? If I've found the right no's it
says the no. 32 centered at the top, then under that is 113-301-103, then
centered under that is the letter E, then under that the VW logo. These no's
are actually raised, not stamped.
 
32 
113-301-103 
E 
VW 
 
Is this the code? and what do I have here? 
Thanks, 
Courtney
