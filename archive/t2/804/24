Subject: Re: [T2] does empi = cheap chinese parts?

For me, EMPI=Cheap.  Perhaps Chinese, but of low
quality.  Muffler, a door panel or two, some other
odds and ends have been EMPI.  All have been low end. 
In-fact, the muffler fit a little crooked, and
rusted-out quickly.
   
I have seen EMPI engine blocks which appear to be
substantial and well made, but I have never purchased
or used one, so I cannot evaluate their "engine"
quality.
   
Now I have found Bosch quality going down as well.  A
questionable blue coil 00012, and a reject rotor, just
in the last year.
