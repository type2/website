Subject: Re: [T2] cv boots

Dear Dan,

Due to some poor choices when I came to buying parts, I have replaced 
the cv boots several times over the past few years, and whilst I can 
imagine it is possible to do one end  at a time leaving the shaft fixed 
at the opposite end, I would imagine it is a severe PITA of the highest 
order. I think it would be possible with  a pit or vehicle lift, really 
good quality tools and a good measure of luck when it came to freeing 
nuts and the joints themselves. You would have to hammer  the joints off 
the shaft, with limited room to swing a hammer, and you would be trying 
to free a greasy circlip lying on your back.

All in all, I would advise removing the driveshaft and retiring to a 
nice comfortable work area (with lots of newspaper down). And yes, use 
all the grease in the kits. Although I was doing it so often, I bought a 
tub and borrowed a large syringe from work to measure it out. Putting 
the shaft back on is a little trying - it is heavy and getting the first 
few bolts in to hold it can test the lactic acid tolerence of your arm 
muscles.
