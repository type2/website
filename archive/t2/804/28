CA models required the addition of a catalytic converter. They also  
had a special ignition system (hall-effect), unique ECU/AFM, O2  
sensor and matching wiring harness for 79-83 CA models.

There were CA specific ECUs. The interchange list doesn't list them  
but it makes mention of them lower in the x-ref (CU 104X and CW 105X):

Luckily we have Karl to help verify it:
