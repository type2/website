Seattle resources -

 

Yes - The BusCo rocks, and Ken is a great source of info too. If he doesn't
have it, he can usually point you in the right direction. 

 

You can also get some stuff from Bow-Wow in Lynwood area, though lately
you'll hear "we have to order that" more often than "Sure, let me grab one".
I suppose the internet is killing them. They shut down the Lake City store.

 

For repair shops, I have heard good things about Schaffner motors in Lynwood
from several people, but have never tried them. 

 

 

I did have some work done by Vintage Wagon on Aurora Ave N, but was kind of
disappointed. I had them do a tune up when I was working lots of overtime.
Had to take it back twice.  Once because they didn't get the valve cover on
tight, and the other time because they set timing wrong. They also did an
inspection for me and claimed several things were ok, like the rear
defroster was suppose to be good - but didn't even have wires going to it,
and the heater that was suppose to work great, but the blower motor and
hoses were in a box at my house. Two thumbs down.

 

 

Body work - Not sure where to send you, I do my own. 

 

Insurance - I use the Gecko company, but as someone else mentioned, I have
it on a policy with another much newer car.

 

Emissions - call a licensing place like :

BALLARD AUTO LICENSING AGENCY
2232 NW Market St.
Seattle, WA 98107
Hours: Mon-Fri: 9:00-6:00; Sat: 10:00-6:00
Phone: (206) 781-0199/781-0299 

They can tell you the emissions cut off date, and help you with the
registration nonsense. I know my 76 is exempt from odometer readings and
emissions.
