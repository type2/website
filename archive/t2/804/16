I looked under my bus and all I found was another oil leak :)
It would be good to know if you have solid or hydraulic lifters.
The valve adjustment specifications are quite different.
Which begs the question "Who is doing your maintenance?!"
Looking behind the valve covers you get a peek at the pushrods.
Solid lifter pushrods are aluminum with steel tips, approx. 1/2" dia.
Hydraulic lifter pushrods are steel, smaller in diameter (3/8").
You may need an aluminum magnet to be sure:)

Both of your "stock" engines came with solid lifters, but that doesn't
mean anything, they could have been changed in a PO heartbeat.
If you find steel pushrods, then remove one and verify the lifter.
If you do find hydraulics you can split the case if you are so inclined
to see if there is a hydraulic cam or not. Or not :)

Howdy,   I've got 2 buses...a '72 and a '77, both with stock engines....

2nd question:  I'm told that there is a visible way to
look underneath my engine (with valve covers off?) to verify that my engine
has solid lifters vs. hydraulic lifters.  ('77 stock)  Can someone enlighten
me as to how to do this and what exactly to look for.
