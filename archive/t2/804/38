Subject: Re: [T2] shifter

i had major shifter problems and couldnt drive...
i replaced the shift rod coupler in rear and also my shift rod bushing up front and then snapped all back together... the bus shifts like brand spanking new... very tight and not shaky or loose anymore...
i couldnt get into reverse or 3 or 4th at the time... careful with the shift rod plate.... under shifter once putting back together leave a little loose and wiggle round till you find all the gears...
i put it in third gear and then tightend down anfd went from there..
and yes all this was covered in the bentley at the timei even thought was wrong but wasnt.. was right i just needed new parts...and my shifter plater welded where it broke at the seem...
good luck
peace

I like the stock shifter, less to break and is covered
in the book, you change all the bushings and the
universal coupler, the shifter should be like new and
shift great. Phil
