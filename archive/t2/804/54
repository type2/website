Most insurers are leery of older vehicles since their state of repair is
so variable.  Some of them won't insure them at all, some won't insure
unless you also have a newer vehicle insured with the same company, and
some want to inspect the vehicle before insuring it.

The quickie online insurers are only interested selling the easy policies.
Great if you have an '04 Camry, but not if you have something interesting!

Make some old-fashioned phone calls and you'll find what you need.
