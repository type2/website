Subject: Engine Codes. AMC cylinder heads

What are, if any, the differences between GD and GE series engines. MY
engine is marked GD042279

The cylinder heads on my Westy (78 2.0, FI) are marked AMC. I
understand AMC is a Spanish company who makes good castings, but the
internals can be of suspect quality. This engine was completely
rebuilt and balanced by the PO about 100k ago. A compression test
ranges from 105 to 125, but there is some oily blow by into the
crankcase breather and some "chuffing" (not backfire) when the engine
backs down in gear. I'm thinking that the compression is good but
there might be some wear on the rings that cause the blowby.  The bus
runs well and the engine seems strong.

Would anyone consider removing the heads to check for valve, piston or
ring wear? Or is there consensus for "it it ain't broke, let the
sleeping dog lay"

Any ideas, suggestions, comments?

Rick
