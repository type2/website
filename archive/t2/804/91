i have a set of 2 ton jack stands.  i just get a little scared working
under the bus with them.  nothing i have every taken off under there has
come off easily.  it always requires pulling and hammeringg and that
freaks me out a little.  anyway i'll go with the jack stands this time.
i can just jack up the side i'm working on and leave the other on the
ground?
