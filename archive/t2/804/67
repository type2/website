Subject: Re: [T2] Attorney in the House?

Right! Ask me how many people I know who wanted to practice on the 'light' 
side - and who got sucked into the 'dark' side.  In fact - as a lawyer - if 
you take your ethical obligations seriously - there is no dark or light 
side - its about doing your best for your client in the adversary system - 
so few people get that.
