Socially confused??? <grin!> 

My BRIEF exposure to Porsches gave me the feeling that Porsches are basically refined Beetles! And that's what I like about them... 

Oh to own a 914 or an early 70's 911T 2.4L. Don't need the whale tails, or the 10 inch wide rear tires... 

Maybe I'll go home and play a game of Need for Speed - Porsche... Feeds the daydreams...
