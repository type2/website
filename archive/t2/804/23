You are looking for a quality, decent Air Compressor.
You also want cheap. Do you want it quickly too :) ?!
Stay away from Sears oilless and their "protection plan".
Protection Plan?! In the old days, we paid that in cash
to the mob, now you can charge it on your Sears card :)!!
Anyways, oilless is too noisy, and they don't last.
Try the local classifieds for the perfect compressor
somebody bought new and is now dumping it for the same
reasons you want it. Purchase the most scfm you can.
Sears is DeVilbiss, so name brand beware.
Portable? Extension cords limit power.
Time to rethink. You want it to do bodywork.
Stay close to the grid. Run a longer hose to the work.

Hello All,
I'm in the market for a quality, decent Air Compressor to do my own body
work and run all the basic air tools.
