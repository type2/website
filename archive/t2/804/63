I wouldn't be Chris, I use Brazilian cofap or mahle in super high
performance VW Type 1 engines all the time, the quality is excellent. For a
stock 1700 you should be a happy camper. If my 160HP engines can take it, a
pancake 1700 should be fine.

Subject: [T2] Question about new pistons & cylinders

 

I am in the final throws of making a purchase for some new pistons &

cylinders for my 1700 '72 transporter. I believe I have found what I

need; they will replace what I have and within a reasonable price range.

I do however have one thing holding me back. Every once in awhile I will

run across a posting talking about how much better quality German

manufactured parts are than Brazilian. How much of this is true? In this

particular purchase, should I even be concerned?

 

 

 

Thanks,

 

 

 

Chris
