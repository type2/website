Subject: Re: [T2] Slightly OT: Air Compressor Recomendations?

BJ,

It is all about tank size and flow. Flow out of the tank and air flow into
the tank. The larger the tank, the longer the tool will run at full
pressure. However, the larger the tank, the longer it takes to fill.

So, what type of tank is best?

A "Home Depot" special Husky brand with a 28gallon tank (like I have) is
pretty good for air ratchets and smaller devices. But it drains awfully fast
and only has a single piston compressor. But has wheels and is mobile. So if
you are a patient person, it would do just fine and is in your price range.

A dual stage 100-200 gallon compressor is the way to go if you want to do
any sanding or cutting because it fills the tank and provides positive
pressure at the same time. BUT, it is really heavy, usually 220volt and can
be pricey.

So I would recommend finding a garage sale or thrifty nickel ad sale and
picking up a 55 gallon compressor with a 120 volt oil lubricated motor. I
think you will be happy. Just don't try to spray an entire Bus with it!
You'll burn up the motor!

Have fun!
