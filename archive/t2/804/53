Subject: Seattle bus owners

Hi,

I just brought my bus down from Vancouver. I need any and all information
and pointers on insurance, body shops, mechanics, registering a foreign bus,
emission requirements and parts stores. Basically, I know nothing. The
on-line insurange quote I tried to get did not even recognize the existance
of pre-81 vehicles not westfalias. I own a 78 Westy.

Bob
