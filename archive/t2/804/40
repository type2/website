Subject: John Brown's Buses

Hey Folks,
       Spent the night last night at the Harper's Ferry KOA, the location for John Brown's Buses. I was not the first arrival, as a late model Vanagon Westy was already there! The rain has supposedly ended for this area, light winds tomorrow and a high of 79, partly sunny and 70 on Sunday. So, if you haven't made reservations yet, tell the boss you're feeling sick, go home and pack up that camper and head for Harper's Ferry W Va. and JBB! Hope to see you there!      Jeff
