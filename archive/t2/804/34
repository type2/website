Subject: Good BN4 heater info

For those trying to fix up an old BN4 who can't locate an original,
working, fuel pump here's some good info on a current production
replacemement part. 

Now, if someone has the fuel input volume/pressure numbers for me to
forward back to this guy...

Thanks all,

G2

  This is a yes and no answer.  The pump can do the job but it will have to
be recalibrated to the output required by the BN4 heater.  I do not know
the numbers for the BN4 heater.

Will the current production Espar metering fuel pump #22 4519 01 work to
provide fuel to older Eberspacher heaters such as the BN4?

Thank you,
