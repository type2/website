And there is the key to doing it. Just like for removing the engine in a
late bay. Get a jack under the motor. Remove the two bolts that hold the
transmission up (they are a pain to reach but ...). Lower the engine as
much as necessary (but watch the angle, don't want to bend your shift
coupler).

You can get a WHOLE LOT of extra room just by pulling those two bolts and
never have to unbolt the engine from the tranny.
