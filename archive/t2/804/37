You bought a "new" VW and actually TRUSTED the fuel guage?!? 

When I get a new one (and actually get it running) I pour in 5 Gal from a
can before even trying to go to the petrol station 3/4 mile from the
garage. Then I fill it and see what the gauge does. If it actually goes up
like it's supposed to I refill the 5 Gal can. write down the mileage, and
intentionally drive it until it starts to sputter on fumes to see if the
needle actually goes all the way to the "E" (and to get a good idea of how
many miles a full tank will generally carry me).
