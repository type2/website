Subject: cv boots

i'm going to be replacing both the left cv boots today.  do i do these
one at a time, or can i remove the driveshaft at both inner and outer
cv's, replace, and bolt back together?  as far as the grease goes i'm
guessing i use the entire tube that came with the kit?

thanks in advance.
