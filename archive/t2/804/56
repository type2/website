Hiya All,

Just as an addendum to this thread................

I became aware of the scarcity of this switch (the 4 pin - 2 contact door 
switch) a few years ago.  So I went out to a wrecking yard and collected 7 of 
them.  Interestingly, none of them (and they all appear to be identical) have a 
VW parts number on them.  They do, however, have a VW roundel and the number 
4482 embossed in the plastic body.
