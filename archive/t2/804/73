Subject: Type 3 engine conversion

Hello all,
I know this has come up in the past, but I didn't have luck with the 
archives.

I got a type 3 engine and want to convert it to a type 1 setup. What 
parts/mods do I need?

I'm working on finding the following:
All cooling tin (how many pieces are there exactly on a type 1? top 2 
covers, shroud, back, front, oil cooler tin,  2 cool tins, 2 heater box 
cover plates.. what else?)
fan
oil cooler
Manifolds/carb (original carbs are junk)
alternator stand/alternator
pulleys
oil filler assembly
heater boxes
muffler

I'll have to block off the type 3 style oil filler tube hole in the 
case. It looks like the original fuel pump should work...
what else am i missing?

thanks
Eddie
