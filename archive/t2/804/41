Shaggy-

Zoinks! I just replaced the bushings and swapped out the shifter in my 76
Westy and like it a lot better than the stock shifter. Tighter shift, a
shorter throw, and the reverse lockout makes getting into reverse much
easier for my girlfriend.  I used a SCAT model 80503 - a long chrome
T-handle shifter with a reverse lockout. I bought it from a place in
California called Jbugs. I wouldn't order from them again though, took them
almost 6 weeks to ship mine (They finally shipped it two-day fed-ex the same
day I called the credit card company to see about doing a charge back). I am
also in Seattle, so drop me an email if you want to take a look one day.
