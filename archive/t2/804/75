Subject: Re: [T2] FI or carb

Hi Shaggy,

Learn to maintain the FI. It's no more prone to leak than carbs. I  
converted my dual-carbed bus over to FI in the spring of 2004 and  
have been quite happy with it since. I drove the same bus with carbs  
for 5 years before that and the FI is definitely superior.

Happy trails,
