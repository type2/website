Subject: does empi = cheap chinese parts?

hello again,
 just tried to put a quiet pack on my ' 75 FI bus. the box said empi. the
muffler said empi. the extractor said made in china. i never got the muffler
on because the extractor was too short and would not fit. i could get one
side bolted up but then i was a quarter inch short on the other. is this
common or is this just inferior chinese craftsmenship? i wasted a
frustrating two hours on this tonight in the gravel of my driveway
dismantleing the old holey muffler, trying to put on the new one then
stopping and putting the old one back on. oh, well, nothing a schlafly pale
ale and dinosaur jr. can't fix. not that these mean more to me than the meal
my wife cooked. it helped as well. you know got the blood sugar back up and
all.
  jeremiah
