Hello Eddie   First you will need the adapter that turns the oil filler hole 
into a dipstick hole  empi, bugpack  CB, scat make these    I have all the 
other stuff you need where are you located  I am in vIRGINIA    You can use the 
type 3 oil cooler which is a little better than thetype 1  also doing that will 
give you an oil switch otherwise you will have to drill and tap the case for 
one or you will have to cut a slot for the oil switch to show thur the fan 
housing. . The other difference is the oil cooler stud but that isnt a problem   
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
