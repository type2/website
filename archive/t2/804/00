Hi again:

Before I sold my Benz, I was on a list for Diesel Benz's.  It was a good 
list but often the moderators were not watching.  I would have 60 emails 
a day talking about some old list joke with Moose.  I had to go on 
Digest with them and then went off completely.  I am glad that Prof. 
George and others modify this so well.  It is a pleasure to read.

I do wish the bus talk would be a bit more active.  With us bus owners 
split between hippies and vet's who served in Germany, it is a great 
place for exchange of ideas.  As long as we do it there and not here.

As more of a hippy whose Dad served in Stuttgart and came home with a 
Beetle, I see both sides and enjoy you all.  If I can ever afford to do 
an engine drop and clutch job on mine I hope to come to a bus campout in 
2006.  Till then I am stuck with around town driving.

BEN
