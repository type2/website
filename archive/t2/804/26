Subject: 83 Vanagon gas heater F/S

I finally got around to dismantling the extra 83 I
have.  I hated doing it but I don't need this vehicle.
 The body was basically straight and rust free, but
off to the crusher it goes.

I pulled the gas heater off tonight and am offering it
for sale, harness and all...$125 (does that sound
right?)
Winter is coming and this could be modified to fit a
bay window also.
