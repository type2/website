The aluminum will heat up and expand more quickly than the steel stud --
which is what you want. 

You may want to try putting the heads in the freezer overnight. When you
take them out warm the area around a stud with a cool yellow flame (so you
don't take the head from freezing to super hot too fast and crack
something). Don't let it sit too long out of the freezer before starting.
There's a lot more aluminum there than steel so the stud may warm to room
temp quicker than the head. If you can figure out how to stand the head up
in an ice tray you could also freeze a little block of ice around each stud
to keep them cooler longer. Warm the head then crush the ice off and use
the stud puller -- or put double nuts on before freezing and leave the
"back nut" clear of the ice so you can get a wrench on it after warming the
head.

Also try the "parafin wax trick" to get a little lube in there. Warm the
stud up as you hold a chunk of wax (a good white candle should do) against
it until you see the wax start melting. It should wick into the threads
inside the head somewhat.
