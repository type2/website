Q:   Is there any opportunity to use a canoe if I take one to Natural  Bus??



Hey guy  I just got on here at work  yes there are plenty of  canoeing places 
at naturalbus  the campground will even shuttle you or you  can rent a canoe 
from them.  there is an easy class 1 run above the  campground ,  below the 
campground is a class 3 run .  20 miles away  is Goshen pass on the Maury river 
which is one of the best whitewater runs in  the state, class 5 when it has 
water. It drops 80 feet per mile and has some  serious rapids.  sorry for being 
late as I don't get on the net at  home  later  Mark Dearing
