Subject: bike racks

We bought two bike racks at Canadian tire and had a very good welder make frame 
for the front and back.

He then modified the racks to support the bikes.

I checked the weight of the vehicle and it was 100 kg below GAWVR at a truck 
scale.

These vans are trucks, I thing they can take it. I inflated the tire to tire 
spec of 45 psi and I burned a lot of rubber of them this trip.

I put the lightest bikes on the back.

Next bikes will be smaller and lighter.
