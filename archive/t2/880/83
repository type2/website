Subject: New Carb Question

Hi,

Here's the details:
1600 DP
34PICT3 carb

I recently noticed a few drips of gas coming from the side of my carb
where the accelerator linakage connects to the throttle shaft (right
side of carb). The gas only drips for a few minutes after the engine
has been shut off, but it is enough of a concern that I'd like to fix
the probelm fast. I ordered up a rebuilt carb a few months back from
Richard Carey. The new (rebuilt) carb looks great, but for some reason
I can't get it to work right. I start with the initial setting of 2.5
turns out on the mixture screw. When I initally turned the engine over
with the new carb it ran great for about 15-20 seconds then slowly
sputtered as the idle dropped and the engine died. I attempted some
adjustments to both the mixture and idle screws but I can't seem to
get it to run for more than a few seconds at a time.

Yes, I've read all the type 2 library bits on these carbs. This is my
second attempt at installing this carb and I'd appreciate any
tips/suggestions.

I'm currently running a 132.5 main in my working carb. I've tried the
new carb with both 127.5 and 135 mains with similar results.

thanks
peace
