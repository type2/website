Hey guys  Sounds like the heat shield is also missing  .    Famous Vw  words  
Rust gets them slow  Fire  gets them quick   Always carry a fire extinguisher 
 in fact two  is even better .  Had a 75 westy burn to the ground when it 
threw a rod and  it cut the fuel line at the 5th injector  ??  Who would have 
thought  such a thing could happen ?   later  Mark  Dearing
