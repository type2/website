Look for and find the source of the fire. I expect
you'll find a burned wire in the vicinity. I suspect
the loss of power was due to an electrical short which
ignited the seal. If your exhaust is hot enough to
ignite it, you've got some serious problems - I think
not. If there is a big enough hole for backfire flame
to ignite it - I doubt it.

I think the backfire was also a symptom - when the
wiring shorted out, the ignition stopped, then the
wire got free for a second, ignition started and since
there was unburned fuel in the engine you got the pop.
Second pop, same scenario.

Given that, there is a possibility the cause of engine
cutout could be a short some distance from the fire,
and if enough raw fuel got into the exhaust system
before the "pop" that in fact COULD be the fire
source.

Find what caused the engine to cut out.

CHT would not have told you anything relative to this
incident. I'm an avid supporter of CHT gauges - when
done properly* - and this isn't relevant.

*A single CHT on our vehicles tells you nothing.
Better to invest in a single EGT gauge. A QUAD CHT can
save your engine. (Still doesn't apply to this
incident though!) -BaH
