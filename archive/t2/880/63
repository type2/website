I have mounted bike racks on the front of a vehicle before, and
although it was handy to get into the back with the bikes on the
front, the bikes took a beating.

It sort of depends on how sensitive you are to having bikes covered
with bugs (assuming you're in an area where bugs plastered all over
the front of your vehicle after a trip is common) and paint chips.

I was using a bike rack that was attached to the vehicle by four hooks
on the bumper (two on top, two on the bottom).

Having the bikes on top is nice, but then you start getting concerned
about bridge clearances, and inability to open the pop-top (if you
have one).

I've never had the bikes on the back of a vehicle.

Now I put my bikes inside while travelling.
