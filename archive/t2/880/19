Chris and the BustedBus are life savers.  I'm lucky to have them in my 
backyard.  Chris has loaned me parts of his own busses, towed me when my 
clutch cable and clevis pin broke, provided tons of help and 
information, and has become a good friend.  It's people like Chris that 
make the ACVW community so great.

All this reminds me that I need to fix my cargo door.  I was camping 
last weekend and the girlfriend couldn't open the damn door to save her 
life at 4am to go pee.
