Subject: Free front seats from 78 Westy

I replaced the front seats in my '78 Westy. The passenger seat is stock
(Mexican Beige), but all the padding is long since gone in the seat and it
is well faded. The Driver's seat has been re upholstered in brown and is in
good shape. Both seats are in good mechanical condition.

 

They are free to a good home.

 

The catch.. You must be able to pick them up from Newcastle, WA. I just have
no interest in dealing with shipping these.

 

If interested, let me know.
