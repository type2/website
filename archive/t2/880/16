Firing of the injectors is set off of 'ignition events', therefore a tach signal. You can set how many squirts you want per ignition event but the total volume of fuel is based on:

1. air density,
2. "required fuel" which is a settable parameter initially based on engine dispalcement, # of injectors, flow rate of injectors
3. volumetric efficiency which is a tunable paramaeter for different combinations of engine load and rpm
4. manifold absolute pressure (which is analagous to engine load)
5. O2 sensor correction factor
6. any warmup or acceleration enrichments present

You really should read through the theory info on the site multiple times until it starts to take hold.  I am not slighting you in any way - it has taken  me a long time to get it all to register - and of course it only starts to make good sense once your engine is running in front of you and you are tuning it on the fly!

The TPS works with the acceleration enrichment scheme in order to tell how hard and fast you have just stomped on the accelerator pedal. I think that is all it is used for. Accel enrichment can also be based entirely on manifold pressure and zero TPS (or anywhere in between the 2 extremes), but I think there would be a delay involved if you go that route.  TBone appears to be using this method.
