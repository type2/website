I've had nothing but excellent things to say about Busted Bus. They've been really good to me and in turn I've made it a point to buy a LOT of things from them.  I've also had good dealings with Bus Boys.

I also like Bus Depot as well. The only thing I don't like is that it takes them nearly forever to respond to an eMail. I just ordered a new muffler from them, and I don't know if they've received payment or not?

I needed all new suspension items, but I wasn't sure exactly what I needed for my Bus. I emailed them, but never got a response. I ended up buying all the suspension stuff from Bus Boys. Still, Bus Depot has been great for the things I've bought from them, just wish they checked their eMail more often. They'd have a lot more money from me too!
