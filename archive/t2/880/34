The potentiometer? How's about placing us somewhere
near to where you're thinking! Are you referring to
the airflow meter on a stock L-Jetronic FI?

If so, I've heard of people "fiddling" with the spring
adjustments and looked into that myself a few weeks
before replacing both heads and the airflow meter.
It's been a quite few years ago. I figured out that
wasn't really the way to go - about $2000 later!

Did I guess right? -BaH
