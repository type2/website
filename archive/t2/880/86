i all

Well its finally done, last week Polly passed her test, I am English so 
its the MOT test.  And yesterday I paid the huge fee to Tax her and she 
is back on the road.

What have I learned;

Well, next time (there won't be a next time), I would pay a few thousand 
more for one which didn't need a complete rebuild..
I wouldn't try and do the whole thing on my mothers drive (Won't fit in 
the garage)
I wouldn't relay on my brother in law who is an excellent welder, but, 
it turns out has a life of his own, which doesn't revolve around busses.
I would not replace everyhing, just 'cause I was in there, my "famouse 
local supplier" Master Cylinder grommets didn't fit, the originals 
(which were fine) did! (Any one want some rubber that doesn't fit)

I have also learned that here abouts anyway, its a lonely world.  We are 
on our own!  The nearest tuning guy, was in the next town, difficult to 
get to if you can't take it on the road, and no local shop would do any 
work, usually saying, "I havn't worked on one of them for 25, 30, 150 .. 
years.

However (and heres the point) make lots of use of the archives and th 
library, without which, as they say, non of this would have been 
possible.  And you never know too much, after trying to get rid of an 
exhaust leak, 3 times, I read the archive and discovered that all I 
needed to do was file down the manifold, I wished I had read it BEFORE 
the first time.

So Thanks everyone, who asked all the questions, gave all the answers 
and contributed to the library, please keep it up.

And the final irony,  I am being sent on a training course to LA (thats 
about 6000 miles away from here) and then we are staying for a couple of 
weeks after that so I won't get to use the van until August!
