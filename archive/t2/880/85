Subject: Re: [T2] New Carb Question

Hi,

It's actually the old carb that is leaking, not the new one I got from
Richard (as far as I can tell that does not leak). But, it is the new
one from Richard that I cannot get running. I'd like to exhaust all
options for getting the new carb running before I'm forced to contact
Richard for a possible return.

Thanks
jules
