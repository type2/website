Subject: Re: [T2] New Carb Question

The carb I sent to Richard Carey for rebuilding also leaked gasoline when 
it came back to me.  I took it back over (I'm local) and they reworked it 
(within a day), but it still leaked fuel in the same manner as you describe 
when I reinstalled it. My fuel bowl would actually weep and become damp 
with fuel, almost like it was porous. I returned it to them and exchanged 
it for another rebuilt carb.  The second one was fine.

Sometimes you will get a bad one, but trust me, they will make it right for 
you.
