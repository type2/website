Hey Adam - Just got back from a quick look at your
website. Funny we haven't crossed paths at Nehalem Bay
before! This year I'm not even going to be able to
afford this coming weekend (free camping!) I noticed
you have a problem with your shift lever positioning.
It's really not a problem at all, because you can
easily reposition it. Basically - Put it where you
need it to be, then push the plate over with a flat
blade screwdriver and tighten the bolts the rest of
the way. Read that paragraph in the Bentley manual a
couple times! -BaH
