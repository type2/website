Subject: Re: [T2] front-seat headrests

From Robt Mann:

Has anyone added headrests to the front seats of a '73 kombi?
Whiplash is real, and my wife is a nurse  ...   It's not that we
expect water-injection to snap our heads back so viciously, nor even
that we expect belated NZ apeing of the '65 USA Whiplash Insurance
 Caper (slap a strong roll-cage into a junker car with OK brakes, pass
some wealthy- or corporate-looking driver at the speed limit, pull in
just ahead of him/her, and stand on the brakes.  Sue the 'offender'
and settle with his insurance company at $bulk for whiplash, at that
time defined on cardinal symptoms not signs).    But my wife is
right.  Surely there is someone else whose wife has said "I feel very
vulnerable" ?
Are those 'coat hanger' knobs just aft of the head strong
enough to be one fixing of a headrest independent of the seat, or
must one weld onto the seat  -  or the bulkhead just behind it?

73 was the 1st year for factory headrests. The provisions should already be in the seat backs.  Feel along the
top of the seat back, in the middle. You should feel 2 holes. They are 7/8" in diameter and 10" apart.

73 to 75 headrests are soft vinyl with a zipper along the bottom from post to post.
Age is getting to them..... the zipper cloth is deteriorating and separating.

76 to 79 headrests are molded vinyl. They last longer except where the UV rays hit the sides and harden the
vinyl, then they crack instead of flex.

I have pairs of either style in every color VW made. [only the best ones in condition!]  If you want a pair,
let me know.
