Subject: Nitrogen Filled Tires

Hello All,
A guy here at work was telling me about his tire filling experience the other
day.  His tires were low.  He was going to fill them but his friend filled
them with Nitrogen (he had some).  Evidently, nitrogen has larger molecules
which prevent the air from seeping out of the tire as fast.  Did a Google
search
and he was right.  A tire stays inflated 3 times longer.  It states a typical
tire can loose almost 3 pounds of pressure per month (that sounds like a lot
to
me).  Also, read an article which stated that the US government estimated
that the nation loses more than 2 million gallons a day to under inflated
tires.
Said you could typically increase your mileage typically 3% if inflated
properly. Herebs the bad partb& prices ranged from $2 to $10 per tire at
stations.
I was wondering if anyone out there was running on nitrogen filled tires.
