Subject: Weld in, or slip on inner rocker panels?

TAB-402-431 - INNER ROCKER PANEL LEFT - BUS 68-79 (EASY SLIP-ON INSTALLATION)   
  
TAB-402-411 - INNER ROCKER PANEL LEFT - BUS 68-79 (FULL WELD-IN INSTALLATION REQ'D)

I can't weld, so my thought was to use the slip-on panels after cleaning up everything and using a rust converter. Then I'd use Panel Adhesive to glue these into place, and finally a seam sealer if needed, and paint of course. Then  I'd put on the outside rocker panels.

Any thoughts on this?, I havne't done any body work so big before.  
These are both at Cip1.ca (California Import Parts)
Thanks,
Courtney
