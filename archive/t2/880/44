Subject: Bus Fire Survial

Hello,

Coming home the other day from work I avoided a horrible end to my 72 bus
(pancake style engine).  I was about 5 miles from home (my drive home is about
60
miles).  My bus seemed to loose some power.  Heard a couple small backfires
going up my 1st of 2 bridges.  Coasted down to a straight away and noticed
some
smoke at the rear.  Pulled over and opened the hatch to discover a fire in my
engine compartment.  Opened my slider got my extinguisher (I'm SO glad I had
one) and put out the fire.  The engine seal had caught fire. Pulled off the
entire gasket and sat there until my engine cooled down.  I wish I had a head
temp gauge (should have had one). Started the bus and slowly made it home.

I try to keep my engine very clean.  The only thing I could say is that their
might have been oil soaked into the gasket near the oil filler tube.  The
gasket at that point is very near to the exhaust muffler.  That's where it
ignited. I'm not sure why it got so hot.  Ibll have to check my timing (see
if I'm
advanced to much) or running too lean.  Was the smoke in the engine bay
choking
my intake air (I have dual carbs with an open eliminate)? Is that what saved
me?  After I cleaned my engine, I noticed my Thermostat seemed to be not
working (the pass side flap is opened while cold). I know Ibm not out of the
woods
yet; Ibll have to do a compression check to see if all is well.  Ibll be
out
of commission for abit.  Has anyone ever experienced this?  Any advice on a
new seal.  Any help would be appreciated.  Please everyone get an
extinguisher.
Thanks.
