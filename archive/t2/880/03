I didn't know they could be relined?

And they're way cheaper than what you found: At Aircooled.net the stock
style (with a slightly larger dish than stock) are $285 + $40 for balancing
to .1 gram.  Raby's Type4Store.com has stockers for $249. No mention of
balancing though.

I've honed the cylinders and re-ringed the pistons, but I wouldn't expect
much life out of them.
