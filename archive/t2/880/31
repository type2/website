Disney is putting out a line of slightly-larger-than-Matchbox cars from the 
movie.  I saw them in Wally Mart a few weeks ago.  Cost $3.17 US each.

Filmore the splittie is one of the ones available.  I saw three at the store 
that night, bought two.  One for myself and one to eBarf, sell or something. 
If they're not showing up at other Wally Marts, maybe I should go back and 
buy up the few that were left?

I also saw a line of PEZ dispensers from the movie, but alas, no Filmore...
