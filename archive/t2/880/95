	Nitrogen instead of air in tyres is a bit like 
water-injection  -  the reasons look convincing, and the technique 
catches on for a while (in NZ, late 1970s) but then sinks almost 
without trace.
	The history of technology is not sprinkled with 
irrationalities  -  it's dominated by irrationality.

	Air is roughly 4/5 nitrogen.  The rest, for the purposes of 
tyre inflation, is oxygen  -  which has a slightly heavier molecule. 
The difference in performance as a tyre gas is not due to molecular 
weights (on which basis nitrogen would diffuse out thru the rubber at 
a slightly higher rate) but to the (would you believe) oxidative 
properties of oxygen.
	Anyhow, what matters most is not how it works but whether 
nitrogen is a better gas in tyres than air.  I believe the evidence 
is quite favourable to nitrogen
