Subject: Re: [T2] New Carb Question

Hi,

Thanks for the tips Andy! The float appeared OK, no cracks, not full
of fuel. The spacer under the float valve was wrong (large spacer
instead of the smaller spacer). I also replaced the float valve with a
solex valve I've had soaking in carb cleaner for a few months.

Now I can get the engine up and running, but only until the choke
fully opens then she dies.

Suggestions?

thanks
Jules
