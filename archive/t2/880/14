Thanks for that info. I read the website with the guy not using a TPS and
wonder how well that really works. I assumed that this is what was used to
determine when and how long to open the injectors, but I guess I am wrong.
What is used to determine the firing of the injectors? I would like to use the
stock setup as much as possible, so eliminating the TPS would save some
trouble.
