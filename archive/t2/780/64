Subject: Condenser mounting question

On a condenser like the Bosch 02086 found here:

http://www.jbugs.com/store/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=02086&Category_Code=9994 


the plastic piece with the connector is pressed into its hole in the 
distributor and the metal condenser mounting strap has 2 prongs that fit 
over the plastic piece to hold it in.

Now on a condenser like the Bosch 02054 found here:

http://www.jbugs.com/store/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=02054&Category_Code=9994 


the condenser mounting strap does not appear to fit over the plastic 
piece to hold it in (i.e. there are no prongs). In this case I am 
wondering what keeps the plastic piece from coming out?

Sincere thanks,
Bill Moon
