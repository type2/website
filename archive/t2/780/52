Thats what happened recently on my 1988 Honda Civic.  The key was getting 
where it would
not turn in the switch.  It was intemittent at first then wouldn't turn at 
all.  I tried a spare key
that came new with the car amd it worked fine.  Sometimes I guess the key 
just gets
worn down too much........
