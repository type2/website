Well, I've finally got the entire assembly dissassembled and on my desk.

Part numbers

Lock: 211905855B
Steering Lock assy: 211905887B

Switch is still out in the bus.

The lock appears to have full travel of aprox 100 degrees from off to
the starting position.

The steering lock assembly has a mangled spring hanging out of it. I'm
definately leaning toward this being the broken part.

I'm going to look around for a replacement. Anyone? Anywhere?

Barring a replacement I think I like the idea of stripping all the
inards out of this part and seeing if I can get it to work without the
steering locking mechanism. Probably start that project now.

Anyone ever pried off the back panel on this part and looked inside?

Thanks for all the help and suggestions so far. I'd say I'm almost at
the half-way mark now.

peace!
