This method comes to mind to produce leverage on the wheel:  1. A long 
lever like a 8 ft 2x4. Rope or belts. Run the 2x4 through tight loops 
placed around the arms of the steering wheel near the center.  Rest one 
end of the 2x4 on the open window door lip, using a piece of ply board 
as a means to spread the contact force on the door. For more angle of 
pull, lay a higher fulcrum like a brick on the board.
Pull up on the other end through the open passenger side. Assuming about 
2 ft to the wheel center, one can magnify their upward force by 3x min.?
