Subject: 71 Bus 2 day specia  (was 71 Westy cheap)

Volks,
Most of you are familiar with my bus, I still have it and only have 2 days 
before I move. So here it is: If somebody on the list wants it, I'll let  it 
go for $1200. But I need the money by the 12 of August. I think everybody 
that has seen it agreed that it was a definetely worth the original asking 
price, so if you needed some motivation, here it is, $1200. Give my baby a 
good home.

Victor
