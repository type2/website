ok,  I'm sitting here with a Bentley hardcopy of that wiring  diagram.

easier way, follow the power.

battery is "A"
  .   big heavy wire in the center goes to ground which is the bottom line
  .   ignore the orange colored dots they are the test network which is
non functional on most buses.

  .  other big heavy wire coming out the top of battery goes directly to
the starter motor

*test*  remove wire from terminal on starter, leave hanging safely, check
check for current flow at battery as you have in the past..
   current, # check wire for worn insulation or shorting.

   no current.  hook ONLY the battery wire back to starter.
*test*
   current,  probably bad starter.

   no current  hook any one of the wires back onto big bolt on starter
with the battery wire.

   current. you have found circuit

   no current hook up a different wire  until you have them all back.

   what ever wire you find that causes current to flow.  go to next
junction and repeat until you find the problem.

as you follow the wires you will see a little box marked "S" with a
number.

   That "S" indicates a fuse, and the number is the fuse number.

. one wire goes back to the voltage regulator/Alternator
. one wire goes directly to the heater blower motor thru it's own inline
fuse (this one is the cause of many problems. remove this fuse and check
again) this is the small motor on the top of the engine bay.
. third wire goes to the front of the bus to the starter switch/fuse box
etc.   a wire from the starter switch goes back to the small terminal on
the starter.  this is the trigger/soenoid on the starter


let me know how this part goes.

wiring is untangling a tangled fishing line in a mess. slowly one wire at
a time. it can be time consuming, start where you know it is right and go
til you find where it isn't righ

good luck

Bob
