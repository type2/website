Here is the correct front bushing:

I found that the replacement center shaft shuttle cock
bushings don't fit and are worthless. Probably nothing
wrong with yours.

Here is a post I made back in 2002 on replacing the
front bushing:
http://www.type2.com/archive/type2/088869.html

The shift coupling, at the nose of the transaxle, is a
pressed-together cheaply made unit. Before I put a new
one on, I mig weld the cage to the center hub in a
couple of spots. They have a bad habit of slipping!

The archives are your friend..... use them.

 i am trying to replace all the bushings and etc for
 my shiftrod....
  
 i have lost 3rd and fourth +reverse and took the
 shifter apart today and didnt find anything out of
 the ordinary except i was missing the 9a the stop
 plate.
 the 9. stop plate was there though.... 
  
 Looking on page 10 fig 3-15 and again at fig 3-14
 there is a break down of what i am looking at
 replacing.. ((((((((((((((((((((transmission
 section......)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
  
 i have circled  9a,9, and from there i see object 10
 which to me looks like a 66-73 bus sleeve not for my
 bus correct?
  
 and then i got to order 14.16,then the rear coupler
 hopefully containing everything that the rear
 coupler will need to be new again...?
  
 can someone help me here please make sure i get
 everything ordered i might need..?
 i got to get my bus back on the road i start a new
 job on monday and cant be dropped off at work for
 long without going insane....
  
 the sooner i can get the parts the sooner i will get
 it fixed.... 
 thank you all so much for any time it might take you
 to give me a hand here...
  
 i am looking to making my shiftrod feel new again so
 i am hoping by making all the bushings new this will
 do just this???
  
 it not going into third or fourth has something to
 do with up front in the shifter itself but i could
 not tell what is was?????
  
  
 also when looking on bus depot i seen a front
 bushing that was round and rubbery?? i did not know
 where this one went cause i dont see it in the
 bentley...
  
 anyone got a updated 76 model or better shematic of
 the shiftrod and its bushings?
