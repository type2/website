Subject: Another vacuum can

I was able to locate a dual vacuum can from Wells. This one is for a  
74-79 FI beetle and is Bosch 07 114. The Wells number at Autozone is  
DV1867. I haven't tried to order one but the specs are close to the  
dist dual vacuum can if you are in need of something to pass a smog  
test or otherwise.
