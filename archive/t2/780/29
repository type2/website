Hi,

The steering wheel is off. Much of the plastic around the horn and the
bottom side of the wheel is already chipped off. Looks like a PO tried
the puller method unsuccessfully.

Once I found something big enough to get loose the M18 bolt (a friend
had a 1-1/16th socket in his jeep) all I did was:

Spray a squirt of PB Blaster around the splines.
Slam on the nut with a BFH while pulling straight up on the steering wheel.

and off it came. Much easier than pulling at 3-9 oclock and 6-12
oclock. That wasn't getting me anywhere.

Now, suggestion for removing a circlip without the necessary tools? I
figure maybe I can do it with some small screwdrivers.

Thanks
Jules
