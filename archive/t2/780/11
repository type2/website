Hey, Jules, when you find a steering wheel puller for your '71 that will NOT 
break the plastic surrounds of the steering wheel, be sure to share that 
info with the list.

When I tried to Mickey Mouse a steering wheel puller on my '72, I wound up 
breaking the top edges of the plastic on the steering wheel, the section 
right next to the horn button.

Since then, I had a steering wheel puller manufactured for me by a local 
machinist, and I have used it three time, quite successfully.

But if you know of a commercially available steering wheel puller, please 
let us know...
