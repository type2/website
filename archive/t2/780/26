It sounds like your ignition switch mechanical portion is buggered. 
Seen this?

Hi all,

Hotwired my bus and made the drive home successfully.

Thanks for all the steering wheel pulling suggestions. I'll let you
all know what works.

Still no suggestions on what may have gone wrong initially. I guess
I'll find out when I get in there.



Thanks
Jules
