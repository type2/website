Orientation: steering wheel top = anything you see sitting in the seat. Bottom - anything you see laying on the floor looking up. 

Just smack the bottom of the wheel on opposite sides with the pal of your hand. 9 and 3 o'clock, 12 and 6, 2 and 8, etc. Keep the steering shaft nut on the first couple threads so the wheel can go anywhere after it is loose.

I've got one which won't turn 2 new switches all the way to "start". Could it be the lock? I have it out on the bench and the trouble is the same. I can turn the switch with a screwdriver and get all the functions to work.
