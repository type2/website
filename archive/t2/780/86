Subject: Re: [T2] battery tray rust out

>Anyways, a friend suggested I try a battery vent.  I said some BMWs as well
as cars with batteries mounted behind the drivers seat had a vent kit.

 

In my last bus, I installed a marine battery box - plastic box with a sealed
lid that has a rubber vent tube you can run out of the bottom. It totally
eliminated the battery rust problem. Pick one up at any sort of large
marine/boating supply place.
