Subject: battery tray rust out

Hello,
I have had alot of problems with battery tray corrosion. I have already 
replace my battery tray and it now has the 1x6 piece of board as a temporary fix.  
I had painted the last tray with wurth rust guard and the stone guard (so I 
thought it was bulletproof).  

The mistake I believe last time was that spongy type yellow under battery 
mat.  I think it just always stayed wet. 

Anyways, a friend suggested I try a battery vent.  I said some BMWs as well 
as cars with batteries mounted behind the drivers seat had a vent kit.  Has 
anyone incorporated this in thier van? I would love to see a picture of it if 
possible. I have obtained a plastic type tray out of the scap yard, which I will 
mount under the battery with clearance to my new tray.  Any other suggestions? 
Thanks
