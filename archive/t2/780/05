OK,

I think I found my answer in the archives:


1. Make a "remote starter switch" pushbutton switch normally open with one
wire to the "little wire" on the starter and the other wire to battery "+"

This provides +12 to the solenoid when you push the button and will turn
the starter over but not start the motor. For actually getting fire you
need to:

2. Make a jumper with at least 12 gauge wire and run it from battery "+" to
the "+" side of the coil. This part acts like turning the key switch to the
"run" position.

We'll see if that works. I will exercise great caution. I appreciate
any other suggestions or insights into what may be causing the switch
to fail to turn completely.

thanks
