Thanks for the support. I'll keep everyone updated.

I've got the whole lock cover assembly off the steering column now. As
I was pulling upwards on it I pulled the whole outer shaft cover out
of the floor, wasn't expecting that to happen.

So now I'm able to better inspect whats going on. I've got the switch
out. The little plastic (nylon?) piece that fits into the switch and
turns appears to have a mashed up spring riding around next to it.

Still struggling to remove the lock. Made a J-wire tool as illustrated in

http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co.uk/spooky/barrel/barrel.html

but still cant seem to find the correct hole to put it in to pop that lock
out.

While I had the whole thing half-disassembled I jiggled the key around
a bit and got it to turn the whole way again. However I can't
reproduce whatever steps I did to make that happen again.

I'm thinking the part I'll be needing to replace is the assembly in
between the locking mechanism and the switch, the part that contains
the steering lock assembly. Haven't pulled the part number yet, I'm
hoping to have the whole thing removed shortly. Am I going to have a
hard time finding one of these for a '71 (what do you call it?)? It's
part number 8 in the diagram on
http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/igbay.htm.

Thanks
Jules
