Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch part numbers...

For quite some time I have been working on a 5 digit to 10 digit
comparison table.  Originally done in 1990 in dBASE III+ and then let
it languish for over a decade, but I've since upgraded it to an Excel
Worksheet in the past year in hopes of uploading it to my website in
both Excel and Acrobat formats, but it's still a ways off (I'm trying
to make the interchange a bit more manageable, it's HUGE!).

My research into the number Bill Moon provided indicates that this
condensor isn't available under the North American 5 Digit Product
program at this time and doesn't even appear in the Bosch WD Price
List issued out of their Chicago HQs for US and Canada use.  Further
poking around indicates it's only installed on a "VW 1600" of either
Mexican or Brazil heritage, but sources I dredged up doesn't offer any
other details.  I'd love to see a detailed photo, preferably with the
wiring uncoiled, a close-up of the condensor can and the style of plug
into the distributor, plus the length of wire from the condensor can
to said plug.  By seeing these features I can possibly determine an
interchange to the 5 Digit number.

Please send the desired details to me off-list please to:
