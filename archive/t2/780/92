Subject: water tank end cap 

Hi guys ,

Is it that obvious that I can't find any info either on google or type2 
archives about the end cap spec of my water tank ?
Is anyone has an idea where to find them , I've seen a 1" end cap at 
Home depot , do you think it could  fit, that's the closest I found 
taking measurement with a caliper ?

Thanks

Have a great WE
