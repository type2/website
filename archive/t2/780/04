Subject: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the way

Hi,

So I drive out to the country to take in my friends mail while she's
on vacation.

Hop in to go home and the key wont turn all the way - bus won't start!

Its a '71. At my disposal are Bently, some tools, and luckily an
internet connection.

I'm stuck here until I figure this out - no steering wheel puller in
sight so I'm not sure if I'll be able to diagnose or fix the problem
here.

Details:

The key turns enough to unlock the steering wheel. Not enough to
switch on the accessories or start. A little earlier tonight I think I
experience an ominous sign when I had a similar problem - I had
parallel parked, and as such the steering wheel was turned fully
counterclockwise and locked, but I was able to turn the wheel, unlock
the steering and turn the key all the way to start it.

I've tried turning and locking the wheels in both direction in the
hopes that whatever is jammed up might be freed again. No luck.

What I'd really like to do is hotwire it and drive home - then in the
morning get on my bicycle and go get a steering wheel puller and fix
the problem.

How do I do it? I'm frazzled. can you help me get home?

Also, what might be the cause of/solution to the problem?

thanks
peace
jules
