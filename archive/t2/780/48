Subject: curtain fabric for early bay Westy

No, I don't have the ORIGINAL checkered pattern fabric, but my fabric store 
had a bolt of similar pattern and material on the discount table.

I just bought 6 yards of 54" wide fabric at a really decent price.  With a 
good measuring stick, that is MORE than enough material to cover all the 
Westy windows.  I know, I just finished making a set of  curtains with'70's 
period material and it came out pretty decently.

The counter lady said she thought there was more than 6 yards left on the 
bolt (You would need 5 1/3 yards or 16 feet for 54" wide fabric.  I just 
over-bought again!!  Perhaps I will have enough to make a privacy curtain 
between the driver/passenger compartment and the main body of the Westy..)

Normally, curtain to cover one window, either the sides or the rear is 
either 1x60" or 2x30", so the 1x53" is good enough.  There will still be 
sufficient bunching at the top when the curtains are closed.

My special 30% discount coupon expires on 14 Aug 05,.

With discount, the price is $2.79 / yard + taxes....  I paid like $17

I am going to take a picture of the fabric now, and I can sent a pic to 
anyone who responds to me via P-mail right now.  The squares are 1.2"; 10 
squares to a foot, and both sides are near identical.
