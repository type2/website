Well,, as it looks now, the sun and the moon and the earth and mars are aligned
enough to let me travel to O-hi-O for the Dixie Bus gathering.

Ruth, Me, and the "girls" will be heading out around 5pm thursday , thru
Buffalo,, Erie PA, then who knows maybe Clevland, then towards Columbus where we
turn off towards Mt Vernon....... and I understand Frank Biffath will have a
large signal fire burning to light our way into the campsite.
