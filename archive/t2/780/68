Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Overhaul

Thanks, Richard. I've been searching for the overhaul kit all morning, but 
it's pretty elusive. When I looked through the archives I found talk about a 
few vendors, but they don't carry said kit any more. I'll probably head down 
to the flaps to see if I can piece together some of the parts that I can't 
reuse from whatever they have in the bins. Or see if I can order the kit.

Also, between the dist. drive gear and the case I found only  one shim. 
Should there be two? I think I read in one of Hoover's sermons that two are 
the norm.

Thanks a million for the diagram!
