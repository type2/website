pics of the puller you had made? I had a bitch of a time getting my bus 
wheel off. It really seats on that taper. I now run an aftermarket smaller 
wheel, and I drilled puller holes and can pull it with a normal puller, but 
getting the stock wheel off...I pounded on the shaft with a brass drift 
while pulling up on it with my legs. I ended up flaring the column shaft and 
ruining the threads...had to get another one from Busted VW and change it 
out.

Hey, Jules, when you find a steering wheel puller for your '71 that will NOT
break the plastic surrounds of the steering wheel, be sure to share that
info with the list.

When I tried to Mickey Mouse a steering wheel puller on my '72, I wound up
breaking the top edges of the plastic on the steering wheel, the section
right next to the horn button.

Since then, I had a steering wheel puller manufactured for me by a local
machinist, and I have used it three time, quite successfully.

But if you know of a commercially available steering wheel puller, please
let us know...
