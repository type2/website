Roughly:

Your distributor needs two of those fiber washers (one inside and one between the drive dog and the body) but the repair kit only contains one:

If you only need one you can order this kit for as little as $10 from any IMC parts dealer in town or whomever you get Bosch parts from. I've been quoted as much as $20 for this kit so it depends on how they gouge you.

At one time Karl was helping me to locate this part by Mercedes pn but I didn't follow up on it.
