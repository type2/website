Subject: Bosch part numbers...

Does anyone know of a cross reference between the old bosch 10 digit 
part numbers (that are actually stamped on the parts) and the newer 5 
digit part numbers. Specifically, I am looking for the 5 digit part 
number that corresponds to 9231081575. This is a condenser.

Sincere thanks,
