Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the way

Got it with a combination of needle nosed pliers and smallish
screwdrivers. Used the pliers to compress the spring while working it
from underneath with the screwdrivers. And yes, it did go flying off,
but not hard enough to draw blood.

I'm not sure I understand the need to remove the circlip, washer and
the bushing underneath. I was able to remove the four screws below and
pull the steering column down far enough to access the lock and
switch. I got the tiny screw out which holds the lock in. Now I'm just
looking for the release which enables the lock to be removed. Am I
correct in believing that removing the bushing will allow me to remove
the entire lock/switch housing? Is this necessary? I no longer have
wiring connectors to disconnect, a PO has hard wired the switch and
the turn signal wires directly to the wires in the dash. I'd rather
not disturb that rats nest if possible.

Thanks for all the help so far, while I haven't yet located the
problem I do feel like I'm making some progress toward that goal.

I love you type 2 people!
peace
