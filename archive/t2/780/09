Subject: [T2]Alternator wireing...back panel.?

ok so no response and this is all i have found so far about the little black box on the back of the alternator? which is nothing?
http://type2.com/bartnik/alternator.html
 
it says this when taking off but nothing about little black box wire on back inside of alternator?
 
"undo each of the 8mm nuts. Grab the washers too and set them aside. Pull the plate off the alternator and you will find the wiring inside. There is a 3-prong plug for the wiring that goes to the voltage regulator, that just pulls off. There is a wire that goes to a post for the B+ connection, undo the 10mm nut and set it aside, then pull that wire off. Mine had the post under a little rubber cap. 
Now that you have the wiring undone, you can finally remove the alternator from the van. Twist and turn and wiggle it until it's facing just the right way to get out between the body and oil filler tube and out it comes."

Then goes onto this

"At this point you may want to inspect your cooling boot. Mine was in fine shape so I left well enough alone. I was tempted to replace it but I couldn't see how it connected to the fan housing. So now I have a spare."

his My question is over the little black wire and if the other wires get hooked to the same bolt on the back of the alternator or not or do they get hooked seperate..

i am aware the starter wire gets hooks to the B+ bolt on the back of the alternator stated plainly here

 

"First thing you have to do is the wiring, so hook up the 3-prong plug and also the wire to the B+ post. Then re-attach the rear cover. There is a grommet where the wiring passes through the rear cover. Make sure this grommet is fully seated. If not, cooling air can escape and your alternator will run hot. Since the alternator backs right up to the right cylinder head, it needs all the cooling it can get. 
Now put the alternator back into its normal position. Make sure you get the rear cover plate back into the cooling duct. This is a good time to re-install the adjusting track. Once you get the track back in place you might as well go ahead and re-seat that heat duct if you moved it. Don't forget to put the bolt back in." 

 Once again though no mention of the little black wire from the little black box on the back of the alternator?

just taking caution from what some of you may have already known and done a thousand times before. Even though i have tackled the alternator before i have never really paid much attention to this till now and would liek to make sure for safety sake i have enough things happening right now besides burning another alternator up.....

thanks in advance to the first with the right info for me and my bus...

76 bus btw...
