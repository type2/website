Chris, the little black box is a static arrestor to
help stop raido noise, the only wires you have to be
concerned with are B+, which has the rubber boot over
it(10mm nut), it goes to the soloniod on the(Red wire)
starter. The plug has D+ & DF, with D- below them,
these three plug into the voltage regulator with the
blue wire coming out of the plug for the alternator
light(the black wire that is at the regulator is not
needed it was used for the test circuit. Phil
