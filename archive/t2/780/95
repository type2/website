Subject: having a nice looking extendable thermostat is not all, right ?

Hi again,
I am installing a thermostat on my vanagon, I found one which was 
completely folded and fully extended in boiling water.
Once installed , the string of the flap ( which keep the flaps open by 
default) is  so strong that it expend the thermostat half way. which 
mean I a loosing the  closed flap position (half closed).
Do I miss something here ? Is the flap string too strong for my 
thermostat ? I guess the thermostat should be strong enough to stay fold 
even it the flap string tend to expend it.

Not only the thermostat should be folded at room temperature (RT) , 
expended when heated by the engine ... AND also (that's new to me ) be 
strong enough to counterbalance the flap string force and stay in a 
folded position at RT.

Am I right ?

Thanks

Chris
