Hi

Everything is pieced pack together and working fine. Ignition switch
is working flawlessly again.

Only a slight annoyance, the turn signal canceling doesn't seem to be
working.

Is it possible that I put the steering wheel on 180 degrees off?
Probably should have marked it before removal. Is the metal part that
sticks off the bottom of the steering wheel supposed to go on the left
or right side. It's on the left right now, the side with the turn
signal switch. Is this  incorrect?

Thanks
Jules
