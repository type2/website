The bus is up and RUNNING!!

Hooray!!!

Duh... Duh, duh, duh... After checking what seemed like every possible
electrical connection, we decided to replace the battery.  And did.  Problem
solved.

With a new alternator, new starter-solenoid, new voltage regulator, and new
(used) wiring harness-- not to mention new front shifter bushing & rear
coupler -- and adjusted timing, she is running like a dream.

Though our right rear taillight is out.

Doh.

Always something, in a VW...

Thank you all so much for your useful suggestions.  I've learned a ton.

Tomorrow - back to California!
