Subject: torsion arms identification

I scored a set of torsion arms with new ball joints already pressed in for my
71 Westy.

Then I found out that torsion arms are for 68-70 and 71-79 apparently. How do
I identify which ones I have? I'd like to verify I have the correct ones
before I tear into this job.

Searched and searched the web and haven't found it what numbers should be on
them for 71+.

Advance thanks,
Daniel
