Hi Dan,

My first advise would be don't get discouraged. Sometimes (often) scary
noises can be easily diagnosed and fixed.
Was the noise consistent at all speeds?  Did steering in either direction
have an effect?

It might be worthwhile to employ a helper to listen for the noise. Some
times sounds caused by the front end sound like they're coming from the
back. If it happens while going slow, drive around slowly in first gear and
have someone walk along side to find out where its coming from.

My first guess would be the CV joints. Are you certain you assembled and
installed them correctly?
