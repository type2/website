Subject: fan seal

Hi,

 

I lubed and slid the fan seal on by hand.

 

It is level with the back of the engine face. Does it need to be seated more
deeply?

 

BTW, the halves of the engine are about 2 to 3 mm offset from the factory
build I suppose.

 

I need to know so I can put the rest of the fan system back on.

 

I am going to lube and put the keyed pulley bolt holder on to keep dust out.

 

Tightening torques please!

 

I think it is 11 foot pounds, or 132 inch pounds all around and the center
bolt.

 

Alan
