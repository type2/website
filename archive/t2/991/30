Hi, the first time I drove the last bus I got there was also a horrible 
clunking noise from the rear. By the time I had stopped it, one of the 
rear axles had fallen off! The other one was very loose and almost off 
too. Half of the bolts had bent in the process and I had to drive it 
home with only a few bolts holding it in.
Are yours tight?
