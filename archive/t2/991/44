Subject: Re: [T2] [T2]: Head swap with installed engine, strange push

I've read that if the push rod tube retaining wire isn't installed  
properly (properly is against the ends of the push rod tubes; see  
figure 10-4 in the Engine and Clutch chapter in the Bentley manual)  
then the rotation and in/out motion of the push rods against the wire  
will cause that sort of groove.

What could cause the push rods to look
like the ones in the first two pictures?
