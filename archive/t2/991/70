that was my problem' also. and in thinking about it I believe I shimmed
the bottom of the door and discovered that VW did so also I found stock VW
shims that fit perfectly. also you can adjust the sliding hinge, part one
of Bentley, fig 5-58   while it doesn't say so those 4 bolts also slide
inside the hinge.  I put a jack under the back end of the door, loosened
the bolts and jacked up the door slightly and retightened the bolts. took
about a gazillion tries but when I got it right the door suddenly worked
like a charm.

no I don't think so
