Subject: Help, Need Driver's Seat (77 Westy)

Well I spent about a week trying to get my drivers
seat out of the bus to go to the upholstery shop...no
joy, it was rusted in place I guess.  This seemed
strange since there is very little rust on the vehicle
to begin with.

I gave up, and took the entire bus to the upholstery
shop, figured I'd let professionals get the damn thing
out.  Well, three days later, no joy again...they gave
up!  They did say that they could probably cut it out,
but then I'd need a new seat frame.

Sooo..anybody got a seat frame they'd be willing to
sell? Upholstery condition doesn't matter, but the
frame needs to be functional. 

Also would appreciate any input on what I should
expect to pay for such a seat.

TIA,
