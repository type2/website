Subject: I could use some suggestions

I'll start out by restating I'm a total beginner when it comes to working on
my bus. After years of sitting I cranked up my bus and to let it run for a
short time to warm it up. I didn't have any problems cranking it up. After
that I changed the oil, oil filter, and fuel filter. Changing the fuel
filter was a nightmare because I was bathed in gas. When that was done I put
more gas in the tank and tried to start it up again, but now it won't start.
I looked underneath to see if gas was leaking and I didn't see any leaks.
When I turn the key the engine turns over and sounds normal, but it just
doesn't fire up. I'm looking for suggestions of what I should check before I
consider paying for professional help. Thanks for your time.
