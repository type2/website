Thanks for the info.

Just to clarify. I know how the circuit works. I know this brown/white wire
is supposed to be plugged into terminal S on the dimmer relay. The wiring
diagram doesn't include a schematic of where that connector is on the top of
the fuse block. I can't see it. I know it plugs in there somewhere but I
can't see where. I was hoping someone had a pic so I could feel for a free
spade connector.
