Subject: BUSQUINOX, Sept 22, Valens Conservation Area, Ontario

Well the header says it all.
For no good reason, except to camp, I will be holding my annual salute to the
end of summer.
Busquinox.
Held on, or close to, the equinox, we get together for a weekend of nuthin'.
Just Camping.

Activities include, sitting, drinking, cooking, sitting and whatever else you
feel like doing. In the past people have lit a camp fire, thrown a frisbee
(very popular) and even gotten lost in the rain. My goal is to relax, I hope
yours is too.

The cost is whatever the gate charges, plus $4 to cover the reservation fee
that they hit me with. Usually the gate charges $26 per night.

Held at the lovely and scenic Valens Conservation Area, there are hiking &
biking trails, look-outs, and cook-outs. There is a nice beach, swimming area,
and FLUSH TOILETS.

For more information, pm me, or google "Valens Conservation Area".

If there is interest, I will extend this to include Friday night, but I need
to know soon. Please PM ME if you are interested in going both nights, as I am
on digest mode for the list, and I often lose track of the digest posts.
