Last Call for High Country Bus Festival in Boone, NC  http://www.highcountrybusfestival.com/
 
What a perfect way to cool off in the mountains and join over 150 other bus folks. The temperatures will be in the mid 70s and lows
of 60 at night.  I am heading up to the campground today should have internet access if there are any questions or someone should
need to reach me.  Tomorrow will be the last day to pre-order t-shirts.  If you want to make sure you have the correct size and
color give Busy Hands Printing a call or email.  Information can be found at http://www.highcountrybusfestival.com/tshirts.htm
 
Hope to see you there!
