ouch, ,ouch,  what a bummer....have you got a replacement for the
replacement???

on my bus note, Safelite showed up today at 11:30 to put a new windshield
in my bus.  3 techs and 5 hrs later it was finally in,  seems the new
rubber from Bus Depot (Don't remember where they got it) was just a hair
too thick and they could not get it to go, so put back in with my 30 year
old rubber.   any one know what would work to replace that "Chrome"
colored plastic that goes in the slot in the rubber??

asked for one with a tint at the top, was told they didn't have one, told
them that was OK, so they show up with one with a tint, oh well. have nice
tinted windshield now.  maybe  just maybe I'll drive this thing yet.  boy
was going to Everybus "expensive"

hope you get yours' back together before busses of the corn.  not sure I
have any parts to help you out.....what went up in your engine
