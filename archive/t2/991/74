The seat didn't budge a single millimeter in either
direction (it was nowhere near the lock cam either).

I was fortunate to find a good used seat at a yard
near my house...plus headrests which I didn't have
either.  For $50 the salvaged seat will be a better
restoration frame than the one that's rusted to the
bus anyway.

Thanks all.
