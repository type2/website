Yeah... that I know.  However, when the catch is moved to it's lowest 
position, the latch is still hitting the catch and bouncing over it. 
Plus, if you move the catch to low, the door will not be in its correct 
final position when closed.

I'm just wondering if it's supposed to hit the catch before latching by 
design or not.
