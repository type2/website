Subject: NOID light

Does the tern NOID, as in NOID light, stand for anything?

I mean, does 'N' stand for 'nitrogen'?

I am trying to figure out if I can plug an instrument panel light bulb into
the FI harness and get a signal light reading, or are the NOID lights
constructed so differently that my idea is not feasible.

Serious question, asking for serious answer.
