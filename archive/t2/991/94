Let he who is without sin throw the first stone!

Let's see.  Lots of interior room? unique appearance? reliability?
economy? practicality?

Yep, both bus and xB have it, though I think that the xB is more a
replacement for the Bug than the bus.

The PT cruiser doesn't come close because it doesn't have as much
interior room or reliability.  The only one I've driven (a new one,
on a test drive) had a bad alternator bearing screaming away and an odd
clunk in the suspension while turning left.  The salesman said it was
normal.  I said thank you and moved on.

The PT Cruiser is a scale model 40's panel truck mounted on a modern
chassis.  The xB is a purpose-engineered vehicle designed for maximum
interior space on a minimum footprint.  You can put four 6'4" adults in an
xB and they will all be comfortable.

I'll agree with you there.  They got a lot of people convinced that
a rather plain and practical vehicle is somehow special.  Kind of like a
little ad firm called DDB about 40 years ago...  :)
