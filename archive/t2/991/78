Hi guys.  Like an idiot, I erased the emails with advice about valuations.  My insurance company offered $1,199 if I keep the Bopmobile.  Only $1400 if they get it!  They must not want it.  That's seems way low to me even if mine is a rust-bucket in places.   I've got to send them info on why I think it's low.  I remember the NADA site but what was the other?  I seem to remember Millennium or something like that.  And it needs paint all around.  But still, I couldn't find one in as good running shape as her for that kind of money.  Somebody tries to by it it from me just about every week.  

A body-man friend of mine came by and we knocked out a whole lot of the dent in the left front.  I busted the headlight in the process (I know, I know, shoulda, woulda, coulda), but I bought a complete headlight assembly (two bolts) and a bumper for $75.  I had to crank the adjuster all the way in to get it pointing almost to center.  Close enough.  And he has a good front section to replace the dented section.  Wants $150 to cut that out.  Might could buy new aftermarket cheaper than that.   I had just about given up on saving her.  But now I think it's worth it in the long run.  Runs great!

I would turn it over to a lawyer friend and fight it out, but I need the money.  I've got some crap coming up you don't even want to know about.  Have a great weekend....KR
