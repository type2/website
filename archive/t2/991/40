Subject: re: [T2] I could use some suggestions

First, you have to understand that I tend to find humor in most postings.  I
am not laughing AT you, but . . .  (no, I guess I AM laughing AT you . . .
)   For example, extracting from your post...

" I'll start out by restating I'm a total beginner when it comes to working
on
my bus."

More than HALF of the list members were total beginners.  Only some had
experience with air cooled beetles or air cooled flying contraptions or
Zamboni or flying boats in the Everglades or Mississippi delta.


"After years of sitting . . ."

You need to keep moving or blood will pool in your fanny and create a clot
that can reach up to your favorite body part...


" . . . . I cranked up my bus "

Let us pause and visualize this for a second . . .


"Changing the fuel filter was a nightmare because I was bathed in gas.. . "

You should never take a bath in gas, even if in prelude to changing the fuel
filter.


"I looked underneath to see if gas was leaking and I didn't see any leaks.
. . .it just doesn't fire up."

Stop, do not use the four letter word 'fire' in the same posting as the four
letter word 'fuel'.  Bad Karma and bad doo-doo can happen.


"before I consider paying for professional help. "

Now there is an opening that needs no introduction...
