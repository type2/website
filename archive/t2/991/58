Subject: Hints from Heloise - metal straightening

(1) I was gifted a pair of 'after burner pipes'.  These are the 'U' shaped
exhaust segments on a fuel injected, pre-1979 USA VW which are situated
after the 'exhaust headers' and before the 'heat exchangers'.  They are no
where near the 'heater control boxes'

The flanges on these after burner pipes were WAY ! ! ! out of alignment.
Why, all three corners of the after burner pipes' flanges were sticking way
out, like a three eared hound.

Within 30 seconds, just holding one after burner pipe in my left hand, and
strongly striking, individually, three corners of the one (1 of 4) flange
with a solid 3 lb hammer, the flange was 95% back in shape.  It was that
simple to bend it back.  No need for a 18 ton press or jigs or even a vice.
No need to pound it against a flat surface... [I know there are a lot of
numbers in that paragraph.  Don't let them throw  you...]

Well, that is both good news and bad news.  If it is that easy top get back
in shape, it probably is the reason they get OUT of shape..

(2)  A severely dented push rod tube can have the dent removed and be made
cylindrical again by:

(a) securing a solid rod to a horizontal or flat surface, with a straight
segment of the solid rod sticking horizontally out.  Putting the solid rod
in a vice may not do the job.  I just C-clamp the short leg of an 'L'  lug
wrench to my workbench, and use the longer leg sticking out over the edge.

(b) slide the dented push rod tube over the solid rod and tap the dent with
a normal weighted hammer.  The dent will be 'hammered' out.

That's it.

I saw a musician do this to a trumpet.  He could get all kinds of dings out
of the bell and the accessible parts of the trumpet and never left a scratch
on the surface.
