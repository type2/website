Subject: fan seal help please

I pushed the fan seal in with my fingers until it was level with the back of
the engine. The two halves of my engine block is actually shifted by 2 mm at
that point.

 

The seal is level with the part that is closest to the fan. It is level on
the other side.

 

The failure mode has to have been rust on the keyed shaft that holds the fan
on. That was cleaned up.

 

So, the main problem I have is, does the seal just have to be level with the
part of the engine closest to the fan?
