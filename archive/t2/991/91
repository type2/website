Well, there have been a lot of 2-box car designs both before and
after the Fridolin.

The Japanese have a bunch of them, but only one found its way to
the US.  They want to keep us buying those inflated price SUVs.  The
availability of the xB (originally designed as a Japanese-market-only
vehicle) was a fluke, brought on by Toyota's panic over
losing the Gen Y market and Honda's release of the Element.  The second
generation xB, alas, is far fatter and Americanized.

I doubt that there is anyone left at VW who realizes that VW's strength
was not at meeting the competition head-to-head, but in providing
vehicles that the public wants and aren't provided by others.  Inexpensive
transportation made VW great, but they seem to be ashamed of that
heritage.
