Subject: How much do air cooled, 2.0L heads weigh?

I am thinking of buying a pair of  used , air cooled heads for my vanagon
2.0L, and would like to know if anyone has a good idea of how much one of
them weighs, so I can guesstimate the shipping costs?

Anyone ever actually weigh one, or remember a shipping weight?

Thanks a lot, as always,

John
