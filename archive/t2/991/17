Subject: Fuse Box wiring/ dimmer relay.

I just got a new turn signal switch for my '74 bus. It has the '73/early '74
version.

I had it all hooked up and everything worked except for the high beam
switch. I tried to trace the brown/white wire that goes to the fuse box and
inavertently pulled it off. (when i installed it i cut it and made a splice,
the replacement had that wire cut) . It was loose and thats why the high
beams weren't working.

I can't see in there to hook it back up. Its the wire that goes to terminal
"S" on the dimmer realy. Where does that wire plug into on the top of the
fuse box? Does anyone have a picture of it so I can feel it out?

I have the cluster out and I really don't want to take the top of the dash
off ( but I will if I have to). I think the switch might be bad. They were
working fine with the old switch, but the turn signal mechanism was busted.
Now I have good turn signals and no high beams :)

thanks in advance.
Eddie
