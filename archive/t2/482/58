did they come with a seperate ignition key or should one key fit all?
 
I had a locksmith come out to rekey my seperate ignition key to match my doors key.  He couldn't get the ignition out.  Anyone have any tips on this?  Does the steering wheel have to come off?  Bentley says just remove the retaining screw and it should come out.  No luck here.
 
If I'm supposed to have 2 keys, I'll leave it alone.
thanks you kind sirs....
