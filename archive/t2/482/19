closer to holding an idle but not quite.  When started from cold (about 50
degrees this morning) it dies instantly when the accelerator is lifted.  The
air bypass idle speed control on the airbox has no effect.  Does anyone have
any suggestions as to the first things to check. As I said this happened

David,
From personal experience, I would recommend you check the integrity of the 
the rubber "Y connector" coming from your intake air distributor.  My son's '76 
westy exhibited same symptoms, and he was ready to sell it because he could 
not determine cause.  I checked it out also, but could find nothing as all hoses 
and connectors seemed secure.  As it turns out the "Y" was split on the 
underside.  We put a hose clamp on it, and idled perfectly.  I hope it's that 
simple.
