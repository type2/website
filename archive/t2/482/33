I had a similar sort of accident with similar numbers. They "totaled" it
at $2800 and let me keep it for $1000 salvage value.  I ended up with a
check for $1800, kept my old van, kept my title as it was...made my own
repairs.  Nothing else changed.  I signed a release form of some sort
and that was it.  Maybe things vary from state to state, but "totaling"
isn't necessarily a legal status. More of an actuarial thing.
