One additional thing to consider with regard to the nut material for
exhaust:If you use the copper nuts, and they get rounded or just plain
stuck, they are by far the easiest to get off using a chisel. 
The exhaust nuts vendors refer to as "copper exhaust nuts" are not made
of copper - they are copper plated steel. They are quite hard, will not
round off at all. The are self-locking which is important as the torque
on these is quite low.
