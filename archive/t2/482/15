Subject: Bar and Chain Oil

Anyone have any ideas on bar and chain oil as an undercoating?  I'll have my
78 done by one of the chains like Rust Check but I'm thinking about spraying
under my 60 with the bar and chain oil.  It's not on the road now as I'm in
the process of putting it back together so ....

Isn't there a web site somewhere in which they speak of bar and chain oil?
