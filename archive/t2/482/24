 From the charter:

"--Do not try to promote your eBay auctions or other auctions on the list."

Pretty simple, no?  Not to mention that this is the type2 list, not the type3 list.

Folks, there are only a few rules here.  Please adhere to them.  If you don't know what the rules are, go back and re-read the charter at http://www.type2.com/type2charter.html.

Duane, sorry but we are not here to help you make money.
