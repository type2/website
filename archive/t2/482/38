Have confidence in your ability to time the engine.  It is, quite
possibly, one of the easiest tasks that can be done on a VW, especially
one with a Type 1 engine (us poor saps with the Type 4 engines have to
deal with timing scales on which the numbering has worn off :-)

If you're getting impatient to do *something* with it, you'd be well
served to go out and turn the engine with a wrench, looking for the
timing notch on the pulley, and marking it with some Liquid Paper (just
a teeny little dot of it), and on your timing reference mark (the
crankcase seam on a Type 1 engine, IIRC).  The Liquid Paper really
helps the timing mark to show up under the strobe light.

Hm.  I read an article like this once, but seem to remember that it
said the opposite.  The way I understand it is that there is a
disconnect between the old and new methods of measuring/calculating
octane.  The new method ends up with a lower number, and thus "91" with
the old method is roughly equivalent to "87" with the new method.  Or
something like that.

In any case, I distinctly recall the gist of the article being "you
don't need to put premium gas in your air-cooled VW".

Really, the only benefit you're going to get from that expensive gas is
improved resistance to detonation (pinging).  If your timing is set
properly, then you should not have a problem with detonation.  If you
have modified your engine to have a higher compression ratio, then you
indeed might need to use a higher-octane gas... but I'm almost certain
that you don't need to on a stock engine.

(Certainly, when I was a student driving around a '72 Super Beetle, I
put the cheapest gas I could find in it, and never had a problem :-)
