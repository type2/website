Subject: Insurance issues & questions

Keeping the story short:  A little old lady creamed the left rear bumper,
light  and quarter panel of my 75 Westy while it was parked. I wasn't there
but she left a note and her insurance company, Allstate, looked confused when
I drove it in for their "drive-in" estimate.

The paint is original with factory stripes. It is in mediocre condition and
needs a new paint job anyway, so I figured I would go that route.

The Allstate estimate (and he said he hadn't a clue if the parts were
available, yadda yadda) was $1,700.00 I knew that was low, but he said much
more than that and they would total the vehicle. That is bad for us. I have
another estimate in the $2800 range before a new paint job.

Here's the question: Should I total it? And then try to get a salvage title?
The thing has a brand-new rebuilt tranny and the engine is still strong. All
those parts.... man, it's a gold mine for parts.

I could go ahead and total the thing and put the money in a new engine for my
72..
which needs a new engine. But who knows how soon the transmission will go?

Anybody know any angles to deal with this? Should I negotiate for the
"totalled" price less $100 and kick in whatever the difference is for the
extra $1000 to paint it? (No structural rust, just cosmetic specs on the
outside)>



Thanks for your advice up front,
