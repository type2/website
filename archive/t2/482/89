Subject: stripped stud

Well, my new head I just got back from AVP wasn't put thru the tests I guess.
As I just tried to tighten the manifold with a 3/8 drive ratchet over the
plastic spacer for a weber carb and it pulled one stud straight out.  I was
being extra gentle as I didn't want to crunch the plastic spacer so I know I
didn't over torque.

I really don't want to have to ship it back to AVP again!!!  This stud is one
of the 4 that you bolt the manifold down with and I want it to be tight so it
doesn't leak.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
