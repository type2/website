Subject: RE: [T2] Cooling Tin Grommets & Alt. Elbow

I've been able to use vacuum or fuel hose in place of the original cooling
tin grommets. Cut it to match the circumference of the hole, then split it
lengthwise with a razor knife. Seems to do the trick.

I bought a new alternator boot last year (bus depot?), but saw a thread a
few months later that seemed to indicate NLA. I'd guess the 914 one would
work, but don't know for sure.

Today I was taking my alternator off from the fan housing (not attached to
engine) and failed to undo the clamp that holds the elbow boot to the alt.
The dried, hard, crusty elbow is now almost in two peices (torn by the
clamp). May have been like that before or could have been my forgetfulness,
probably both.

Does anyone know where to get a new rubber alt. elbow? This is the elbow
between the alt. and the fan housing. Bus-boys say NLA with part#
021-903-655B. However, I googled 022-903-655 and found one (Automobile
Atlanta) for a 914 but $30! and a few pages in German. Or can I glue this
one back together?
