Subject: Lisle Piston Ring Compressor - THANKS!

Whoever suggested the Lisle Wrinkle Band Ring Compressor (
http://www.lislecorp.com/tools/catalog/ring/ring.htm ) was spot-on.  I
bought one to use on my 914 motor and it was the EASIEST cylinder install
I've ever had.  I suspect if I had had one of these nifty little tools 2
weeks ago I wouldn't have broken one of the oil-seal rings while trying to
install the the cylinder.  Oh well, the Deves rings look cooler anyway.
Thanks for the tip!!
