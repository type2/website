Subject: Re: [T2] emergency flasher

Hi,

I have a 1968 bus but I have a four pin flasher relay and the more 
complicated e-flasher switch.  On my bus with the keys out of the 
ignition the flashers work, the red light in the switch blinks but 
the green lights on the instrument cluster do not light up unless the 
key is the run position.

I also had a 1967 bus with the nine pin flasher and it operated as above.

Happy flashing
Chris
