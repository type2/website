Subject: Alternator Elbow/boot repair

Greetings List,

'79 2.0L FI

As I mentioned yesterday I have an old torn alternator elbow that seems to 
be NLA. This is the rubber boot that goes between the fan housing and the 
alt.  Various part #'s - 021-903-655B, 022-903-655 seem to describe it. The 
one on my spare engine (a '78) has a different shape to the end that 
attaches to the alternator. It is "D" in shape where my '79 is round or "O". 
The part # on my torn elbow is 022 903 655 with "WFJ 2777" underneath it.

A mechanic friend in town who has several spare 2.0 L motors also had a few 
fan housings but all had the "D" shape and all were hard as a rock and would 
have been destroyed upon removal. He did have a genuine thermostat in stock 
which I snaggged as it seems they are NLA too. Now I need the bracket and 
pully crap...

Any ideas for this boot/elbow? I have thought about gluing the boot back 
together. What flavor of adhesive would be best? It is split around the 
circumfrence at the end nearest the alternator. kind of around the clamp. At 
least 3/4 of the way around.

I have also thought about rigging something. Both ends are round and I think 
a PVC sprinkler elbow would almost work, maybe 1.5 or 2 inch?. Can anyone 
think of another rubber 90 degree elbow like this from some other 
application? Then comes the part of attaching it to the fan housing as the 
normal boot attaches with an internal spring/ spreading clamp deal.

What does this part do anyway? I assume it cools the alternator.

Many thanks,
Brandt
