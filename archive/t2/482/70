Subject: Door Weather Stripping????

Hey guys,

        I know this has been posted before by someone else a month or two
ago, but.. I was curious. I rarely drive my VW Bus. I keep it in the
garage, I blow tons of cash on it slowly restoring it to perfection...
BUT. On the occasional weekend when I do take it out for a spin... the
door weatherstriping drives me crazy!

They're brand new door seals.... I know someone else on here complained
about how they literally have to SLAM the door with all their might just
to get the door to close properly and flush with the rest of the car.
Well... I'm getting tired of slamming the door, because i'm sure it's
wreaking havoc on the door jam, the door hinges, and the frame where the
hinges attach to. So someone... please tell me how I can get my door
seals to finally soften up enough.. or crush enough so that I can close
my door normally like it used to when I bought the bus (when it didn't
even have door seals in it!!).

FYI, I've had the door seals on for about 4 months now. I keep the doors
closed all the time when it sits in the garage (under a car cover too!).


Thanks!!!

Todd
