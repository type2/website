The way that it was explained to me is that soap and water clean the dirt
out without leaching out the grease closely associated with the metal,
what you might call "in the pores".

Whether this is accurate or not, I've never had corrosion problems when
washing CVs in hot water.  The metal holds enough heat that the surface
water evaporates before they cool.
