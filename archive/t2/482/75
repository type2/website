Todd,
I just installed new door seals from Bus Depot in my Single cab.  Are you
sure you have the seal completely seated in the groove?  Use a screwdriver
to press it in.  Is it glued all the way around?  Can you see where it is
rubbing or hitting?  Get under the door and check to see what hits first.
Can you see the seal bulging in any spot when the door is closed?  If you
can, slice off the offending piece(s) a little at a time as you can always
take more off.  Hard (but not impossible) to put some back on. If you do
need to put some back on or fix a tear.  Super glue works great on this.

Hope this helps,
Snoopy
