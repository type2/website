Subject: piston ring compressor

IMHO the type of compressor found at:

http://www.autopartswonder.com/PistonRingCompressorSet.html

works even better than the wrinkle band compressor.   I used the type 
pictured above for many, many rebuilds and it could not be easier.  The 
wrinkle band is SO long that it is very difficult to remove after the 
cylinder is pushed over the rings.  YMMV
