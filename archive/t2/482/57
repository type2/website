Subject: Idling problem solved 

Yesterday I found the reason my 78 Westy would not idle and why the
accelerator had to be pumped to start.  I was, as several members pointed
out, a vacuum hose problem.  It was Intake elbow to aux. air regulator hose
a big one.  However it connected to the air regulator so far down I could
not see it.  It connected to an elbow which was turned sideways.    I only
found it by using Richard Atwell's fuel hose and vacuum hose diagram at
http://homepage.mac.com/ratwell/VacuumHoses.htmlproblem.  This is a really
excellent guide to the hoses.  I now know that that hose was disconnected
for the 18 months I have owned the bus.  It starts now with closed throttle
even at 35 degrees and idles perfectly.  My thanks to Richard and the
members who offered suggestions.
