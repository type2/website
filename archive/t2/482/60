Remove horn pad, steering wheel, switches, then the collar with ignition 
and steering lock. Then you can see the screw and follow Bentley 
instruction for drilling a hole to release the lock cylinder. Total R&R for 
me is less than an hour. The first time I did it was probably 3 hours. Few 
locksmiths are equipped to address ANY Euro lock cylinder. The fact that 
some will sell soft metal keys proves a total lack of understanding of the 
animal they poke keys at.
