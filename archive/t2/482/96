I know they used it in the interior floor boards, or tar boards, as they
called them. They were a pain and a half to get up to do any work on the
floor pan. Never noticed it on my other bugs though. Maybe done at the
shop after a repair or as a customer option?

I think tar is what VW used to undercoat new cars in the 60's. How do I
know? I used to do it as a summer job at the local VW dealer. If it
wasn't tar, it sure smelled and and felt like it!
