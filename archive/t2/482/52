Subject: RE: Alternator Elbow/boot repair

one on my spare engine (a '78) has a different shape to the end that
attaches to the alternator. It is "D" in shape where my '79 is round or
"O".
The part # on my torn elbow is 022 903 655 with "WFJ 2777" underneath it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The different shapes are for different alternators. IIRC one is for a 50
amp and the other for a 35amp? Yesterday I posted a response to your e-mail
calling for the Casting Fool. I have not seen any posts from him lately but
the last I heard he was trying to get a hold of both of these boots to make
repros of them. He has made a bunch of other plastic and rubber pieces for
the type II and used to post quite often on this list. I unfortunately
don't have his address but if you search the archives for Casting Fool you
should find it. Perhaps he has made the boots. Othewise I think I would
recommend either black RTV or electical tape as a patch. Although neither
are too great in the long run.
