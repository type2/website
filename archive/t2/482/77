Subject: draining fuel and checking for debris

thanks to everyone who responded to my previous post. I checked all the 
vacuum lines again and they seem ok. SO now I need to check out the fuel 
filter. How should I check this? Last time I took the fuel filter off I 
ended up with a big mess and I smelled like gas for days. How should I go 
about draining the fuel without getting it everywhere? Anyone know anything 
that will take the smell off of me when I'm done? Any other places along the 
fuel line I should check?

Thanks,
Kyle
