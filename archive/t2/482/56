Subject: Re: [T2] fan blowing fuses

It seems that whenever one listie has a problem another has a parallel.

I too blew a fuse on my aux inline blower the day before yesterday and 
I then noticed slightly less air coming out and a sound like there is 
debris being hit by the vanes. I am going to pull mine today and look 
in there.
Can you see into your Aux fan ? Mine is under my bus inline in the heat 
pipe so its crawling time.

I hope it isn't the bearings !

Steve
