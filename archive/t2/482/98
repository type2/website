Hiya All,

I too had the problem of new seals and suddenly hard-to-close doors.  Turns 
out that the seals I had bought were pretty much worthless.  Surprising to me 
because I had gone with what I believed was a company with a great reputation 
for rubber - West Coast Metrics.

In trying to solve my problem I wound up talking to Ron Salmon over at the 
Bus Depot.  (Remember, Ron is a WCM dealer)  He explained to me that some of the 
seals (and in this particular case, the seals I bought from WCM) sold in the 
USA are from the Brazilian aftermarket where anything goes.  He lined me up 
with VW Brazil seals for my doors.  Fit like a glove.

The lesson I learned?  Talk to Ron before before you buy rubber.  I know I 
will.
