Ok, now we're really wondering into off-topic land, but...

Richard -- do you know how to rename a font in Fontbook?  The 
thirteen_hundred dingbat font seems to have the name "New", and I don't 
know how to change it :-)

(Fontbook also had trouble viewing two of the VAG fonts in the 
collection...)
