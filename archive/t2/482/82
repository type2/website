Subject: Re: [T2] ignition wires

thanks Kyle.. Ok, after researching this, it looks like on a 1975 and up, there is a gray wire off the ig. that goes to the buzzer.  Apparently, I have the wrong ig. in my 73.
A couple strange things though..my door switch has 5 wires coming off it when the diagram says there are only 4.
Also, then what does the wire that is coming from the ignition (brown/blue) and going to that extra door wire for?
All the diagrams show only 5 wires coming off the ig. switch. Mine has this extra brown/blue wire.
Anyone willing to tell me what this wire is?

I'm not positive, but isn't the wire that goes to the switch on the drivers
