Subject: RE: keys

The bus did, indeed, use a single key.  Our kind Dr. is correct on the 
removal instructions.  I do have to comment that there is nothing inherrent 
in the lock where a brass key would cause problems in comparison to a steel 
key.  I offer both steel and brass keys, but the wear is typically on the 
key and caused by the abrasion of the keys against one another rather than 
in the lock.  The ignitions on that bus can be rekeyed, as can the other 
locks on  the bus.  Feel free to contact me shoould you need other 
lock-specific information.
