Subject: Looking for lost VW bus font

Hey Y'all,
this is no where near technical, but on my old
computer (now long gone) I had installed a VW font
front some enthusiast's web site that I would like to
put on my new computer. The font consisted of little
hand drawn buses, bugs, bubble heads, and pseudo-vw
logos. The font name was "1300".  Does anyone know
specifically where i can find this?
