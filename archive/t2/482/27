Sorry already...the members here sure know the rules...four have already
chastised me.
I'm a newby and didn't know or read the rules thoroughly enough...It'll
never happen again...promise!
Whoh...I'm going to go do something more safe now...like enter a biker bar
in a suit and tie.

I am curious though, every time I have placed a question on this list I get
emails from people wanting to sell me their products that will solve my
problem. THAT'S GOOD...I'M NOT COMPLAINING. In fact the way that I found out
about this book was through a helpful listy on this list who turned me onto
the book. I then went looking for the book...found two and decided to make
one of them available to someone else. When I was looking for it, if someone
had one for sale on Ebay or any other list or site...I would have welcomed
them letting me know about it. I'm now wondering how they would have done
that. Someone mentioned The Samba...but I find that site a nightmere to get
around in. Anyhow...I wasn't meaning to step on toes...I just thought
someone else might be looking for the book like I was.

Thank you,
