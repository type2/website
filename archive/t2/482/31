NO!!!   that's a cheap out for the insurance company.

fight em if you have the time and energy, there are other standards for
the value of a vehicle. 
. get the Green book value for older vehicles,
. go thru the archives here on this list and find the selling price of
similar vehicles.
. get an independent estimate.

mine was hit, they tried to total it, I fought and they eventually paid to
fix it...

good luck
Bob
