If only it were so easy.

The new seals are not the same cross section as the original. The 
rubber is harder, too.  When I installed the new non-german seal on my 
drivers door in 2001 it instantly became hard to close, and would 
bounce open again unless you slammed it hard or body-checked it. It 
would do this regardless of how many other doors or windows on the bus 
were open.

After Jamie Rivers pointed out the dent that was forming under the 
beltline thanks to the constant slamming, I decided more affirmative 
measures needed to be taken. I put a fresh blade in my carpet-knife and 
slit the seal, all the way around.

Some day I would like to see a brazilian bus door --  I think they have 
made substantial changes to the area where the seal meets the door. 
That's the only way I can imagine that they would have needed to add 
the extra lip that the new seals have.

Since I trimmed it I have had no problems getting the door to close, 
windows up or down.

Happy trails,
