The voltage on the blue wire rises to alternator output when the engine is
running, in other words when the alternator is spinning and making
voltage, That is when you should measure the voltage
as soon as it hits about 8 volts, the fan relay [J14] will pull in and the
fan [V4] will run, provided you have the dash switch [E16] closed
selecting "MAX" on the dash
This means the engine is running for the fan to run,, I dunno why? I can
assume Vw wanted to limit the current during starting, didn't think it was
necessary to have the fan run when the engine wasn't.... etc.

I doubt there is a fault in the blue wire, It feeds your alternator lamp
on the dash.  Does the alt lamp work when you have the key on?
If the Alt lamp on the dash is not working, then the alternator shouldn't
be working as the lamp is part of the charge circuit.

This is exactly what Vw did for the later bay that do not say MAX on the
heat selector switch on the dash, sometime in 1976, for the 1977 - 78
models

There is a difference, early bay have the blue wire to trigger the relay,
and late bay use power from the ignition coil to trigger the relay

Meaning the early buses MUST have the alternator making voltage, ie the
engine running, and the late bay do not require the engine running, and
can turn the fan on with the key on,

Hope that helps
