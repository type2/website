Subject: hesitation results in stalling

In a previous post I said that my bus was sometimes missing on acceleration. 
But it stopped happening and ran perfect for one day a nd pretty goood the 
next. But then it began to run real poor on the way to the store today. then 
I turned up a big hill, it hesitated and died. Since I could see the store 
from where I was and I was in an unsafe spot I started the bus and pulled 
into a parking spot. I checked the timing and it was off. Dwell was ok and 
everything looked ok from visual inspection. Corrected timing, but it didn't 
solve the problem. Barely made it to 30 on the way home. Almost felt like it 
was going to stall a couple times. Then, 1 block away from the house 
everything starts to feel perfect. I'm cruising. No effort and I'm doing 45. 
what is going on here?
thanks for any help.
