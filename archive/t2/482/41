Subject: fan blowing fuses

My aux heater fan in the engine compartment is blowing fuses. I don't think
it's rotating freely (heard a few sqeaks the last time it started) and the I
think the friction is causing the fuses to blow.

I'm going to remove it tomorrow and take a peek. Any hints of what typically
goes wrong?
