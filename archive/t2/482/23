Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seat belts - early bays question

i recently uncovered the vanagon seat belts that i had purchased a 
couple of years ago. with all this talk i'd like to go ahead & do the 
conversion to my 69 single cab.

since these recent threads have concentrated on the later bays, i'd 
like to know if anyone has noticed any differences in doing this to the 
earlier bays - specifically to a pickup.

Jason - that is a really sharp webpage, the pics were very handy!

thanks in advance!
