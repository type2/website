I agree!  A friend of mine shipped me a 150 pound Fender Rhodes  electric piano and satellite speakers (bulkier but not as heavy) from  Chattanooga to Houston, TX (where I lived at the time).  I don't  remember the exact figures but it was WAY cheaper than any other  method.  UPS wouldn't even touch it.  You have to be able to  go down to your local depot to pick it up, but I've never heard of any  problems.  Greyhound does quite a bit of this even though they  don't advertise it.  Go Greyhound.  Leave the driving to  them.  Cheers....KR

on a space available basis but I've found stuff gets there really 
quickly. I've shipped a number of large body parts all over the country 
and never had a complaint. Just make sure you pack them well with solid 
foam, rolled up cardboard, wadded up paper, etc. No pellets for anything 
large and/or heavy. And make 2 packages so they're easier to handle.
