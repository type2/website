I have searched the vendors on our list (on line

If anyone has a lead on a throttle body for a 1976

There are a couple on the Samba for water cooled,

they are an acceptable replacement or not.
Any advice will be appreciated.

Kevin, you need to specify whether you have an early
76 or a late 76. Early, 8/75 thru the end of 12/75,
has a 6 pin AFM, electro-vacuum EGR, and a dual vacuum
unit on the distributor. Late, 1/76 thru to the end of
7/76, has a 7 pin AFM, mechanical EGR, and a single
vacuum unit on the distributor.

How does this relate to you, you ask?

The throttle housing has a dedicated manifold vacuum
nipple to the rear below the idle speed screw on the
early 76. This is for the retard side of the vacuum
unit on the dual vacuum dist.

The single vacuum unit does not need it, so the
throttle housing does not have it.

I may have an early one. I do have a late one.
