Also, sometime back a law was passed that gas comapanies don't have to  advertise the ethanol content in their gasolines.  Ethanol burns  hotter than gasoline.  Racetrack down here is known for selling  high ethanol content gas and I've known mechanics who tell their  customers to never run Racetrack gasoline.  Don't know if it's  true but it makes sense.  Cheers...KR

this is  a classic sunken valve seat. i have at least 10 heads here  
that look  exactly the same. you probably drove for 100's or maybe  
even 1000's  of miles for it to look like that. it is always the  
intake valve  that goes, and almost all of the heads that do it this  
way are 2  litre heads. It is almost always #2 intake also. I think  
the  instructions for CHT gauge installation should be changed to  
using  #2 cylinder for the sender, because there is pretty good  
evidence #2  runs the hottest.



hey scott I will have to check the pile of heads I have here to see if it  is 
mostly the # 2 intake.. yes it just about always is the intake.  What  grade 
of gas were you running greg? It is my understanding that the low grade  gas 
causes the combustion camber to get too hot cause  of the unburned gas  and the 
cold air coming thur the intake causes the seat to shrink and then come  
loose from the head. later  Mark Dearing
