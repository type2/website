Scott(and Mark),

This is going to be interesting....when Mark looks at his heads and either 
confirms or not whether it is #2 intake.


Why in the world would it be #2 intake(always)? and why does that one get 
hotter?

Anyone have any speculation on that?  It's been awhile since I had mine 
apart that far, but I spent a lot of time getting the flaps and tin 
joining correctly on both sides and double checking the fit and finish and 
movement.

Cheers, dave
