lunch break, and here is where it stands.

if the AFM is unplugged it starts and runs... idles the way it should.

. so suspect the AFM....

stick my spare AFM in and find I've been carrying a "dud" along for years.
glad I didn't need it on the side of the road.
  so pop the cover on the AFM and start the bus, if I hold the flap ever
so slightly open, the engine idles and advances. so "suspect" the backfire
may have moved the flapper on the shaft????  is there any way to check or
adjust this??   I've no experience messing with the AFM guts.. and if I
don't have another one in the garage somewhere I'm messing with the only
known good one??

anyone have more info on how to adjust flapper.  nothing in Bentley...
