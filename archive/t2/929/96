Bob,

I have 78/79 VW sliders installed in my '76 ex-weekender now.  I have them
in backwards so my kids in the back can reach the window controls.  I like
them.

I have 3 or 4 various 68-79 bus camper sliders that are different from the
78-79 passenger bus style but they'll fit.  Might even have one matched set.

You can also have these for shipping if you want.  I'm in Tennessee, 37129.

Later,

Billy
M'boro, TN
