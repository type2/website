the big question is what would have been changed/damaged by the backfire.
before backfire (which I caused not engine problem) it ran ok.

yup pretty close to right on

when I checked, yes

again when I checked yes

only a month or two old....

haven't checked yet, why would a backfire change them??

again not yet, but why would a bacfire change resistance values

pulled em and put them back one a couple times seemed ok, prob should
spray them with the CRC I have for that

why would they change with a backfire,, but they all appear to be right

I do haave a rear start switch , just one hand for accel and another hand
for starter   uh running out of hands...

I can understand why some would cause this problem, but the only thing
that happened was the backfire and now won't run when it did before..???
