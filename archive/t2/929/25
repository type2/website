Subject: Re: [T2] gas theft-siphoning trick

I keep a CLEAR tube about 6 ft long in the bus for this- tube tends to 
bend around in the tank and suck air- the trick is to feed it in as you 
BLOW through the other end until you hear bubbles-push in further 
(seeing that bubbles still sound-then suck until you see the gas and 
stick your finger over the end and place into receptacle.
