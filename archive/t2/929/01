Subject: Fuel Injector Replacement

Hi Volks,

I need to replace a Fuel Injector in my Bus. It has a
'76 drive-train. I've never done this before. It looks
easy. But I do have a question. Do I need to have the
gas tank empty or near empty to do this??? Will
gasoline come poring out when I remove the old
Injector if I have a full tank of gas? I'd rather ask
than find out the hard way.

Thanks,

Rae
