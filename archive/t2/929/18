Subject: Cleaning out intake manifold heater pipes

Well, success finally. Having read all about clutch cables, muriatic acid,
oxy-acet. setups, propane burners and air compressors to name just some, I was
pretty hesitant about this. Thank goodness for friends with patience.

What worked in the end, was a piece of 3/16" COATED aircraft cable with just
the last inch of plastic coating removed and the end frayed out. That and a
bottle of carb/combustion chamber cleaner. My friend Phil and I poured the
cleaner into the preheat pipes and then pushed the plastic coated cable down
into them and used a drill to keep working at it. It was slow going, but it
finally worked. The plastic coating acts as a lube and lets it slip down
easily, unlike the clutch cable that was frustrating and ended up all twisted.
The cleaner also helped as a lube. Whereas the clutch cable had just hung up
on everything, the combo of cleaner and coated cable did the trick. Took about
an hour I figure, but it was worth it. Just a FYI next time you need to unplug
your manifold.
Regards, (and thanks Phil)
Courtney
