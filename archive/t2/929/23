That's what I thought.  But it never occurred to me that if you  want to steal gas, you have to look for an older vehicle as all of the  newer ones have the releases inside the vehicle.  So I guess the  bus might as well have had a free gas sign on it.  But somebody  did indeed steal the gas.  I had just checked it the day  before.  I did go back and look for the gas cap.  No  luck.  One's on the way from BD.  Cheers...KR
