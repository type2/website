Hi Jamie,

I went back to the garage for another look. Turning the head over and  
looking down the intake gave me an interesting picture:

So I pulled the valve.

It turns out that the seat didn't go out the tail pipe as I suspected  
it had... it was busy digging a tunnel into the block.

The valve and the seat look good as new. The head is fubar.

I wonder what would have happened to the motor if the seat had  
punched the whole way through?


Happy Halloween!!
