this would worry me if you are using the stock oil pressure switch,  
which lights the idiot light at something like 6 psi.

a new engine should not be making 6psi at idle. something is wrong.  
you have very thin oil installed, your oil pressure relief bore is  
rough at the bottom where the piston sits, oil pump is worn, or oil  
temperature is very hot. could be any or a combination of these.
