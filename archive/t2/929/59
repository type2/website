Subject: Engine health? Kind of longish

I bought a '77 bus not long ago.
2000cc, dual Dellortos.  I plan to do some necessary body/mechanical work and keep it for the kids to drive locally in a couple of years.
The engine is an unknown quantity and I haven't decided what to do with it.  Engine was supposedly rebuilt (haven't they all?) 10-15K ago by a local VW Guru, since deceased.
I did a compression test and found #1 at zero.  Pulled valve cover and can see that the stem for #1 intake is noticeably deeper in the head.  In fact, I couldn't get any lash no matter how much I backed out the adjuster.  Sunken seat, methinks.  I pulled the rocker arms from the #1 cylinder and proceeded.
All other cylinders are at 135-145 PSI with 5 engine revolutions (engine cold).  I don't have a leakdown tester.
I hooked up a mechanical oil pressure guage and put the bus in 3rd gear (it's on jackstands--to simulate a load as best I could) and let it run at about 1200 RPMs for about 20 minutes to heat things up.  I realize this is not like driving on the Interstate at 65 in 80 degree weather, but it's the best I could do in the garage.  I had to guess at the oil temp (Bentley says to test at around 160F, mine was probably that or warmer) It passed the Bentley oil pressure test (at least 28 PSI at 2500RPM) with about 34 PSI or so.  When I brought it back to about 950 RPMs it will hold about 7-10 PSI or so.  The idle pressure seems a little on the low side to me.
Much like my '78 Westy, which will cause me alot of consternation when the idiot light comes on and the oil pressure gauge drops below 5 PSI in the McDonald's drive thru lane after I've been travelling in warm weather with a load at highway speeds, but it's an automatic.  If I put it in neutral the light will go out.
This '77 is a standard, so the idle should be a little higher than an automatic in drive.
There are no extraneous noises, no oil leaks, and it will idle down really low which makes it easier to hear things. 
It has a Fram oil filter, which I would never use.  This is how it came from the PO.
I don't really want to pull the cylinders and/or split the case if I don't have to.  I'm thinking getting 2 quality remanufactured heads and putting it back together, unless I find something else wrong that isn't apparent now.
 
I welcome any opinions on the health of this motor, or any other additional tests I should perform before pulling it.  Is the idle oil pressure low, or is it about par?
I haven't ever replaced the oil pressure spring.  Does this really work to raise idle oil pressure?  Is there a negative?  I am concerned that in the summer, after some highway driving, the oil pressure at idle will drop too low.
Any thoughts?
