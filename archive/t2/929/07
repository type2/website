I'm thinking more along weird running engine - excess gas in manifold...

Yeah.. that'd be tricky..

Ok, the obvious:

-timing ok? (as far as you can tell)
-getting spark to all cylinders?
-are all cylinders firing
-spark plugs good
-temp sensor I and II good
-checked all the resistance values for your AFM
-the connections to all the plugs for EFI clean (progold is good for that)
-cables attached correctly
-points make any difference?
-fuel pressure good?

do you have an assistant/remote starter handy to at least keep it
running while you pull injector cables to see any change in rpm.
