Hi Joseph,

I have seen one of those in person, though not from the same vendor.  
The one I saw was NATO surplus and was indeed connected to a large  
water pump for fire-fighting. It had handles on the sides so that 4  
men could carry it. It was loaded into a trailer that was towed  
behind a unimog 4x4. I was at the warehouse to pick up a skid of  
185R14 tires, all of them on VW rims, including one brand new wide-5.  
I wound up with a nice set of Continental RT-735s, and after the  
other tires were sold off I only paid the cost tom mount and balance  
them.

FYI: The magneto on that engine would be a high-ticket item,  
desirable for aviation or racing applications.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
