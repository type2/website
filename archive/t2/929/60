Subject: RE: [T2] Engine health? Kind of longish

My freshly rebuilt 2.0 gets the flickering oil
pressure light at idle after a long highway run on a
warmish day. My understanding is that this is normal.

The type-4 motor bottom-end is pretty bullet proof,
I'd probably stick with the new heads for starters
unless you have good reason to belive the bottom has issues.
