Subject: Re: [T2]sliding door glass.??

I'm putting a new door on my 78 bus.  I have never used the sliding door
vent window in all the time I've owned the bus.  would prefer to put a
solid piece of glass there rather than the current design.  I have a
slider but it looks like it goes in backwards with the latch on the
outside.  that can't be right.

does anyone in the Mid Atlantic area (I'm in Baltimore) have solid piece
of sliding door glass. or even anywhere in the country can you just trace
the glass size onto a piece of brown paper I can take to the local glass
place and get a piece of tempered glass custom cut.  or does anyone have a
slider in your bus and know how they go in, or even better yet some
photos.  I have new rubber personally I would prefer the slider on the
drivers side middle window with a solid piece in the door.

thanks
Bob
