Well, that whole system has a wiper that is screwed on to the flapper 
vane.  I'm not sure if it's possible, but the backfire might have moved 
the wiper in relation to the vane and is why you'd need readjustment. 
Just a guess, of course.

Did you check the resistance values to make sure that the AFM is in spec 
for your model year?
