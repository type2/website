When you say you checked all the hoses, does this mean
you removed each hose and inspected it before putting
it back and assuring it is firmly attached? I have
seen many cases where the hoses were found to be fine
only to have another person walk up and grab one that
was either not firmly seated, or, in the case of the
air bypass valve hoses, the entire side of the hose
facing the case was blown off! It appeared to be
perfect from the top. I've been embarrassed by this
myself before. -BaH
