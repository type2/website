Subject: which hubcap on a 72?

folks,
i am piecing together my 72 bus. Which were the
correct hubcaps for that year? Were they the
pronounced domed ones like ca. 1967 bugs or more of
the flat'ish ones like  the ca. 1970 bugs? I don't
have enough of either to make a set so need to know
which variety to further source.

anybody got a complete set of teh correct ones for
sale?
