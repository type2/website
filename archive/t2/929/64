Subject: hub cap rusting redux...

OK, so I was curious as to why replacement hubcaps rust so
quickly...Enough to look up the process on the net...It's not
the chrome, BTW, it's the layers of nickel under the chrome
that count...(Also, better plating starts with a layer or two
of copper under the nickel)...From what I've gleaned, chrome
is "porous" to some extent and without the layer(s) of nickel
underneath, corrosion is inevitable...One site commented on
"flash" coating of nickel...i.e. the least nickel plating that will
still allow a chrome finish, but not provide any corrosion re-
sistance as the norm for cheap plating...;-(
