What am I missing here? You have the opening as a
source for a pattern (less the gasket thickness plus a
bit - which an experienced glassman will know how
much) and you also have a slider assembly which has an
outside shape precisely the same as the glass you
want. With a slight bit of ingenuity, you can trace
either, or both. Cut a piece of rigid cardboard to fit
over the protrusion of the aluminum extrusion holding
the glass panes currently such that you can get the
cardboard snug against the outside lip that fits into
the gasket. Now draw your pattern and cut it, making a
negative pattern which can then be used to make a
positive pattern. Simple. -BaH (I must be missing
something. It's too easy.)
