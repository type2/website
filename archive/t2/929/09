Honestly, I don't know what it would do other than pop off hoses, but 
then again I've never had a backfire.  I do know what you're feelin, 
though, because you just want to know how the backfire could have caused 
the problem.  Unfortunately, you can't guarantee that it is in-fact the 
backfire that is causing the problem...

You might want to go through the whole engine tuneup, ignition test 
procedure in the bentley and then go through the whole EFI test 
procedure in the bosch l-jet manual and you might come upon the culprit 
that way - maybe throw in a compression test for good measure.  Then at 
least you know you've covered all the basics.  That's why I suggested 
all that stuff.. which a backfire probably wouldn't hurt.  Heck, you 
never know, the pop might have thrown out a connection somewhere, or 
even broken a connection in the AFM.

I'd do a complete diagnostic and wire connection cleaning according to 
the manuals and then at least you know everything that is *supposed* to 
work is within spec.  At this point I wouldn't assume anything is in 
spec because it's always those overlooked items that get ya in the end...

Good luck!!
Mike
