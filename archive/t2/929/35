Subject: Re: [T2] which hubcap on a 72?

They were the "flattish" variety (they are still very slightly "domed"
shaped,) common to 71-79 Type 2s, 80-91 Vanagons, 68-79 Bugs, 66-73 Type 3.

They are still sold at VW under the current part number 251 601 151 A, most
likely made in Mexico by Hella.  Some aftermarket places sell them under the
same part number, some under the older part number 311 601 151 D.  The 251
601 151 A variety at the vertical base portion is a tad bit taller to
account for and clear the longer rear axle stub of the Type 2 and Vanagon.

Best thing to do is find a good used set of original German ones for the
better chrome.
