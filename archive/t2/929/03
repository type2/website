Subject: yet another sunroof question

I want to put a big magnetic sheet over the bus' sunroof for the "winter" 
(So. CA) until spring when I can afford to scrape away the rust around the 
sunroof, and repaint, then buy and install the new felt strip.

Q's: Are there any adverse effects of applying a 20 or 30 mil sheet over the 
sunroof/opening? Would it be "better to just get a 2" or 3" strip to cover 
the opening? - which is difficult to find right now. A roll of 24" x 10' or 
x 25' mag sheeting seems easier to find - so far. I can even paint it to 
match.

I've tried the foam-rubber adhesive stuff for a temp fix: it doesn't fit 
right and doesn't last for more than a week in the sun (ironic - 'cuz I need 
it for car washes and when it rains).

Please lay the academic smack down. I need some learnin'.

Thanks!

Stef
