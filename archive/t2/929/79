 does anyone in the Mid Atlantic area (I'm in
 Baltimore) have solid piece
 of sliding door glass. or even anywhere in the
 country can you just trace
 the glass size onto a piece of brown paper I can
 take to the local glass
 place and get a piece of tempered glass custom cut. 
 or does anyone have a
 slider in your bus and know how they go in, or even
 better yet some
 photos.  I have new rubber personally I would prefer
 the slider on the
 drivers side middle window with a solid piece in the
 door.

There are left and right sliders. The handle goes to
the front. You can reverse them and the handle would
then be towards the rear on the inside. Never on the
outside.

How are you going to get tempered glass cut?!?

Glass is cut 1st and then tempered......
