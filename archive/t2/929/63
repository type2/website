if you can use em, Greyhound can be the hidden shipping source. it is also
the companies cash cow. they have done a lot of things to increase baggage
space on the buses and have in the past even converted some buses into
baggage buses being reconfigured with fewer seats and a bulkhead with more
storage space in the rear of the bus accessed from an outside baggage
door.
  in any case, if you can fit their specs they pretty much will take it.
unless you pay top dollar it goes space avaliable so it can take a bit to
get there sometimes.

way back when, I drove those big buses...and schlepped a lot of that
baggage
