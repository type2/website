Subject: aftermarket rear hatch seal vendor

"Can you give me a complete description of what kind of seal you 
need and what website I can find it on, maybe you could just go to the website and get me the ID number yeah that would be great, ummmm yeah..."

List, 

This is how my wife effects the "Lumbergh" from the movie Office Space (mmmm, yeah) and forces me to do the legwork on my own christmas present.

Anyway, the Depot and Busboys have german rear hatch seals for princely sums (I know they're german!) But I need something more kindly to my wife's student pocketbook.

Who's got an ill-fitting prison labor sweatshop hatch seal in california for a good price?
