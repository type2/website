Yeah - keep it. Take the time to do what you can to ready it for the 
painter/body shop. Remove all the broken and bent parts. Shop around 
(you've got the time now) for used parts. Buy an existing rear section of 
another bus if need be.

Shop around for good body shops.

Find out why that e-brake did not hold.

Better than buying another bus that has rust issues or needs a suspension 
rebuild or ???

At least you will take the time to do the repair to your satisfaction and 
will know what you've got.
