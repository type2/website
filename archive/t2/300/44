Subject: Re: [T2] Servos and such

I am not sure about the compatability with M/C, but I do believe that servo's 
were strengthened, i.e. changed for the 74 model year, but that maybe wrong, 
not sure.

The O-ring between the M/C and servo needs to be replaced whenever the the 
servo is replaced. Not sure about other parts, but I have changed over a 
servo and changed only the o-ring, with no problems.
