Subject: mold inside poptop

Hi,

Well, its the rainy season here in San Francisco, and im noticing more and 
more little mold spots on the inside of my poptop.

Has anyone been able to address this issue on their own? I have the whole 
interior out of the bus currently, so taking on a project like this is 
definetly an option right now. Sand all of that green fuzz and mold off of 
it and paint it or what?
