The 2 most common things that cause backfiring are an exhaust leak & a
vacuum leak. Check all the hose connections. One method (up for some
debate) is to take a can of ether (starter fluid, but many people have
suggested using WD-40) & spraying around the vacuum connections. If
there is a leak the engine will speed up slightly. Track down these
first. A good way I have found to find exhaust leaks is to take a
shop-vac & hook the blower to the exhaust tip. Then feel around all
connections (you can spray soapy water if you want) for any escaping
air, which would indicate an exhaust leak.

I'm not sure what you mean gasping. You might be hearing a vacuum
leak, but all carbs will make some sort of sucking sound (since they
are actually sucking :)

I would check the timing anyway, it needs to be dead on for the bus
engine to push that big body around. BTW I just checked my Bentley &
it says that only the 74 1800 should be set to .008 (& earlier engines
with sodium-exhaust valves) the rest should be .006.
