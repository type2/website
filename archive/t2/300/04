Have you tried adjusting the cable to specs?  Does it then begin to feel
spongy again soon?

Take it out and examine it.  The cable is, maybe, a dozen wires twisted 
together.
With use, the outer ones will start to break where the end connectors are 
crimped on.
The result is the conditions that you describe.

It's in the Bentley Manual, for which there is NO excuse for not owning, along
with instructions on how to do everything else.  I believe Ron at The Bus Depot
has the lowest price on the North American continent.  He also sells clutch
cables--get two--you should always carry a spare, along with your spare belt,
fuel filter, and accelerator cable.
