According to the pump at Sams club, I put no less than 15.74 US gallons of gasoline into my bus.  Previous record was only 15.28 gallons.  I did NOT run out of gas, but I must have been very close.  I have always filled it up until the level is 2" from the top of the filler pipe, for the sake of consistency.

Pumps are usually tested on a yearly basis by filling a calibrated can.
Different states have different agencies that handle this.  In California,
it's the State Department of Agriculture!

I've seen 15.25 gallons go in.  15.7 is pushing it!
