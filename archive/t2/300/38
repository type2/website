<< I was just at Home Depot tonight and saw some stuff in the paint dept.  I

don't remember the exact name, something like rubberizer.  It is used to put

a rubber coat on stuff like tool handles, stairs, etc.  I saw it tonight and

looked at it really quick.  I was thinking about using it on my front

bumpers on my 72.  I have to run back to Depot tomorrow.  I'll try to get an

exact name, price, etc.

Plastidip ? The stuff's very thick and meant for "dipping" not brushing.
3 M makes a spray rocker coating that gives a much better finish...As
always, YMMV.
