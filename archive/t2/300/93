Subject: Paint codes/chips resource

Howdy. I just came across this site, and thought I'd pass it on. It   
has paint codes, chips, and even years available for just about every 
make and model of cars, back to the 50's for VW and 20's and 30's for 
American cars.

Might be of some help to you non-rustoleum folks.
