Anthony,

That 3M chip guard aint all too smooth---

If you want your bumper to look like a prune this may be the answer--

I like the tool dip solution---

WOW---!!!

The corect way of doing this is either pop for some good urethane paint,
or add a flex agent to whatever paint, to keep it from chipping.

Later,

TK--

an

Plastidip ? The stuff's very thick and meant for "dipping" not brushing.
3 M makes a spray rocker coating that gives a much better finish...As
always, YMMV.
