Which ones are missing completely? The front doors?
The one with the busted knob is replaceable with a good used one. The chrome
elbow is held on with a roll pin.
The chrome elbows freeze on the shaft from corrosion. Try soaking them with
Liquid Wrench or any other penetrating oil. NOT WD 40. WD 40 is not a
penetrating oil. Try to get them to pivot.
The elbows on the front doors are different than the ones on the rear vent
windows.
I believe the easiest way to fix the fronts would be to replace the vent
window assembly. I can get good ones of those.
The rears are a different story...... VERY tough to find in decent shape, the
bottoms rust away.
