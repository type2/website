This is the problem with the GD type2 list. Threads are 
edited and unless you read every message it is virtually 
impossible to follow the whole conversation. Here is a post 
I recently made to the vanagon list that may help.

There is no evidence one way or the other that Camper and 
Comercial is in danger or not.

It appears I have spooked some Camper and Comercial 
subscribers. I have no info either way, I re-typed the 
letter from Total VW verbatim. Here is a post from type2  
that may set you more at ease...

Thanks,
Chris

From all Dave Eccles has been saying on the JK forum (UK 
now) C+C is healthy and separate to the TotalVW probs.. 
there was some discussion regarding this some while back on 
http://www.justkampers.co.uk

go to chat and then search.. might still be in archives 
although they have been trying to save space recently..

or go here... the C+C website of sorts.. has forum as well..

isnt this the brittish magazine someone was recently 
talking about being shut down and them not getting their 
subscription fees back? someone please repost this info so i 
can FWD it to some other people. there has been alot of 
people at another club of mine recommending this magazine 
and i hate to see a bunch of new people paying for a  
magazine that wont be around much longer and not get a 
refund. many of them sound very interested in it because it 
is more their style than VWT or HVW. if this is NOT the one 
that was recently discussed, please tell me what was so i
wont be confused anymore. (i belong to too many lists, so i 
cant remembereven WHERE i saw these posts! i just hope it 
was here!)

thanks guys,
chris
