Subject: Re: [VB] christmas shopping surprize

I got a little bug for my birthday a few months ago.   I was sorry it wasn't a splittie, but it was really nice.   It is pretty hefty for only being maybe 2" long, too heavy for a keychain IMO. The body is slightly rough, the windows are polished and shiny, the top is a clock.   Is this similar to the bus clock?
