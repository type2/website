According to the pump at Sams club, I put no less than 15.74 US gallons of gasoline into my bus.  Previous record was only 15.28 gallons.  I did NOT run out of gas, but I must have been very close.  I have always filled it up until the level is 2" from the top of the filler pipe, for the sake of consistency.
