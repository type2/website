Subject: vent window latches

Looking for experience/advice before I order pieces to fix the vent window 
latches on my 78. Any installation instructions? How do you remove the 
existing latches - drill out the rivets? Two windows are missing latches 
completely, two are there but the knob is busted and they're jammed on 
there.

The rain and whistling is ok during the summer, but not in the winter.

Thanks
Mat
