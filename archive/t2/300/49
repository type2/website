Subject: Bosch Relays for Sale Site??

OK, I searched the archives, and I searched the web, but I cannot find the 
web site that had various Bosch relays for super prices.

I want to wire up a set of 'fog' lights I just pulled off a MBenz, and I 
don't want to spent $18 for some 20-30 feet of colored wires and a relay and 
some connectors and a LED lighted button and instructions on how to do the 
job right...  (Well, maybe I do....  no, I am a frontier Crockett VW buser 
who knows he can get the job done with his trusty 3.5" -> 9mm pocket 
knife!!!)

So, where was that site??

As payment, I offer these two extraordinary info pages on Bosch relays (in 
general), even though I cannot make heads, nor tails out of them.

((  OK, so I like diagrams of wires that aren't drawn with a straight edge. 
These L(-at-)(-at-)K like my wires, except they don't have the patches of electricat 
tape, or knots that I could (k)not get out.  ))

Please post any criticisms off line to my alter ego at 
roger_mills(-at-)hotmail.com.  He will dutifully ignore them, since he is me.
