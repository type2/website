Subject: Re: [T2] Servos and such

Servos are very complicated.  Go here to see how they work:

I cannot see how one would test one out of the bus.  It is inexpensive to
get them rebuilt.  Call this guy:

H & R Auto Parts Rebuilders  
10328 Oakwood Dr, Dallas, TX 75217
Phone: (972) 286-5516

He rebuilt mine, it cost me about $80.  Took 3 days or so.

New Brazilian master cylinders, ($30 from Bus Depot) for example, are also
inexpensive.

As far as I know, the servo and m/c are the same, '71-'79.  The front
calipers, rotor, front backing plate, are the same for '71-'72 and all these
were changed for '73 on.

Good luck!
