Mike,

Do you want to keep driving a VW?  

If yes than keep what you got and fix it.  Logic behind this is you know 
what is right and what is wrong with your bus.  Any repairs will be the 
trans. and the body/paint job.  All else according to you description is 
cherry or close to it.  If you sell and buy again you roll the dice and 
see if you can get a winner for $1800 - this is your stated value of 
trans. job and paint/body.

I used this logic on an old Toyota I bought 9 years ago for $500 and a 
few months later needed a $1000 front end fix.  I kept the car, paid the 
fix, and 9 years later and 60,000 miles I feel I came out ahead.
