Subject: Re: [T2] What kind of spare tire bike rack is this? 

I can't really tell, but Yakima, Thule, Saris, Rhode Gear, and just about any 
other rack company makes a spare tire bike rack, for two-four bikes. 
Predominantly, they are for rear spares, like in the case of a Je#p, or 
Tro(-at-)per, but then again, not many vehicles have external spares on the front.

Rhode Gear makes a nice one that isn't too expensive.
