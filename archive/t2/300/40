Chris,

Here s the answer to your prayer's--

Vanagon impact strips--


Just about the right width--and are still available.

I made the impact strips for my overriders out of these---worked out
real nice, looks original.

Later

Terry

Hey all, 
I just got some sweet Chrome overriders, and they are sweet. Only
problem is that they are for a Champagne II edition bumper, hence they
don't grlove in for the groove across the bumpers, they groove out for
use with an impact strip:( 
Anyone got any front or rear impact strips, or know of a good way to
make some decent fakies? 
Thanks a bunch!
