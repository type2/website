I have dealt with them several times and ALWAYS had excellent service. I 
bought (recently) two pair of RCA bookshelf speakers for the rear channel 
of my stereo surround sound system in the house. $10 a pair. Radio Shack 
wanted $20-$25 for the same speakers - EACH (pretty close). So at Radio 
Shack prices I got a $100 value for $20.

Order their catalog. There is lots of good stuff in there.
