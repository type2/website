Subject: Re: [T2] main fuse

The VW has a fuse for each headlight. No need for new ones.

If you do the relay upgrade (I recommend it) the relay will act like a 30 
AMP fuse, and I added an aux fuse panel out back and added fuses to the new 
power leads to the relays (and thus the headlights) at the same value as 
the stock VW fuses for the headlights.

I suggest running a new circuit for the headlights using relays (brighter 
lights b/c you've got 12 volts+ vs. only about 11 volts with all the stock 
wiring loses), and a new circuit for any radio equipment.

The stock VW arrangement uses 1 (ONE!) wire to power the whole stock fuse 
panel and thus everything up front. By default that is going to include all 
of the lighting front and aft, the starter solenoid, the coil, choke, and 
fuel solenoid (carb engines). Everything goes up front before it gets 
distributed. Lots and lots of wire before the power gets to the load. Lots 
and lots of old, old connections. Lots and lots of old connection = 
resistance and less power to the loads.

With age the connections corrode and do not pass 100% of the power that 
they did when new. Also the stock system was setup for a very basic lower 
power AM/FM radio - not the monsters common today.

Take the load off the main supply wire by moving the headlights and radio 
equipment to their own circuits.

Another benefit is that the headlight switch will last forever now - no 
load - it is only driving the headlight relay (tiny, tiny current vs. alot 
more driving the lighting).
