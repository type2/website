does it come in white??? LOL

i went to the trouble of sanding, priming, sanding, priming, sanding and
final prime & painting my front and rear bumpers just a few months ago
(after BNNTA) and now, bugs have put tiny dings in the front that i didnt
see until a few days ago when i noticed streaks of rust coming from tiny
little chips in my brand new paint!!! what could i have done (and will
when i redo them) to make them harder to chip? aside from covering them
with rubber or having them powder coated...

wavin a fist at myself for not doing a better job the first time,
