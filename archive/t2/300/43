Subject: Servos and such

Okay, I'm about ready to tackle a very hodge-podge brake system fiasco.  I
have a servo sitting in a box and need to find out if it's any good.  I think
it's from a '71 (if it makes a difference on testing it).  Is there a way to
test it out of the bus?  Bentley has a couple procedures, but they require it
to be hooked up.  Any seals to poke or connections to fidget?  Bentley also
says there is a seal and filter that need to be replaced anytime it is
reinstalled.  Does anyone know where I can get these pieces?  Part #s?  I've
flipped through a bunch of websites and catalogues to no avail.  I've found a
couple of used servos on Samba for around $50 and rebuilt ones elsewhere for
around $150.  I'm also going to need a new/different MC.  Will the MC and
servo from anything '71-9 work?  Will the larger later model servo/MC fit onto
a '71?  One guy had a servo and MC from a '78.  Will this bolt up, work with
the pedal connection, etc...?



Thanks for your help!



Have a good one,

Eric and Funky
