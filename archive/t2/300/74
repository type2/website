i think i have that same beetle clock, with rubber wheels and it rolls! i
got it last christmas. i heard they had them at wally world, but i never
heard anyone say anything about a bus version. and no, it isnt a
keychain... just a desk clock, i guess. it IS kinda shiny when ya dust it
off and polish the windows and clock... funny thing is, i set it last
christmas and never changed the time for daylight savings, lol. so the
time is still good!

wavin and hangin on to my beetle love, livin the best of BOTH worlds,
