Subject: fuel tank location

On the late bays, mine is a '78, the fuel tank is located behind the engine 
wall, correct? Does it extend as far over as the double relay? In replacing 
the screws that hold the double relay, should I be concerned about hitting 
the fuel tank?

I don't have it here, but I looked through my Haynes manual and didn't find 
an answer.

Thanks
Mat
