Subject: Gas tank capacity

Volks,

After putting over 130k miles on my bus, I feel I know it pretty well and tend to wait until the very last minute before filling up the tank.  This past week though, I got a suprise.  According to the pump at Sams club, I put no less than 15.74 US gallons of gasoline into my bus.  Previous record was only 15.28 gallons.  I did NOT run out of gas, but I must have been very close.  I have always filled it up until the level is 2" from the top of the filler pipe, for the sake of consistency.

I have read things about inaccurate pumps before but never believed it.  Now I'm starting to wonder because I really don't think my bus will hold this much gas.  Maybe that $1.19/gallon price wasn't such a good deal after all.
