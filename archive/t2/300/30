In truth, they didn't do ANYTHING to reduce
emissions. They made things worse by robbing the
vehicle of 3-4 HP  to spin a pump that injected  
clean air into ports on the exhaust manifold.

And this is a good example of EPA intelligence
being as unlikely as military intelligence. 
Emissions are measured in ppm instead of total
mass meaning that high compression 4 cyl's are a
no-no but V10 Excursions are "ultralow emissions
vehicles."

My government (except Steve!) makes my head hurt.
