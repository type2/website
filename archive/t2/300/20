Dave -
Great pics, thanks. If you look at pic 001, near the top of the leftmost 
'rib' on the engine wall, there are two holes lined up vertically. I think 
those are the double relay screwholes. Now, in pic 004, you can see how that 
translates to somewhere near the upper left corner of the tank. Whattya 
think? It's close enough to make me go check, especially the lower screw. I 
think I'll do like you said and stick a wire back there.

Thanks for the info, very helpful.

Mat
