Subject: Concept paint job picture. Ideas and input wanted.

This is an idea for a paintjob I want to do on Anya,
my 78 T2. I was also thinking of putting a Deadhead on
the front and run a lightning bolt all the way down
the side under the bears. Not sure what I'll do on the
back. 
 Input welcome. 
Thanks, Giles
Anya the bus, 78 T2
