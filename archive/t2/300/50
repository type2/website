You dont need a "Bosch" relay specificly, you can do just fine with any
readily available SPST or SPDT (the Bosch that is referenced is a SPDT
relay) relay.  A 30amp relay will be fine, they're available at any
auto or electrical parts store.

Or, you can order the genuine Bosch item from many vendors.  One such, who
I've never dealt with (they're the first selling hit from a google
