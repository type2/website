Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone have any bumper impact strips? :(

I was just at Home Depot tonight and saw some stuff in the paint dept.  I
don't remember the exact name, something like rubberizer.  It is used to put
a rubber coat on stuff like tool handles, stairs, etc.  I saw it tonight and
looked at it really quick.  I was thinking about using it on my front
bumpers on my 72.  I have to run back to Depot tomorrow.  I'll try to get an
exact name, price, etc.
