Subject: Re: [T2] Replace OIl Cooler Seals?

Just an update in case anybody is interested. I got the oil cooler off, 
and tested it using the little tester gizmo, a fantastic device that I 
am very glad I purchased, since it saved me a trip to a shop to test it. 
Wouldn't hold even a bit of pressure. Pumping really fast I could get 
the gauge up to 15 psi, but it would disapear in a heart beat if I 
staped pumping. I have been seeing 50-60 psi at idle with a huge hole in 
my oil cooler! Makes me wonder what kind of pressure I would see without 
the huge hole in the oil cooler. I'll keep you all posted on that note.

Ordered a new oil cooler thermostat and a bunch of gaskets from the bus 
depot which should be arriving on thursday, so that I can put it all 
back together and head out to Portland for the holidays on Saturday or 
Sunday depending on how quick I can get it running again. I LOVE my bus.

Thanks list, for helping me find the nut I got stuck on, and teaching me 
so much about wrenching on my bus! I am off to the hardware store to get 
another wire brush to finish preping my tin for a coat of paint. There 
has been a lot of rust hiding just under the old layer of original 
paint. About time it was dealt with.
