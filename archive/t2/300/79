Subject: Re: aftermarket rear hatch seal vendor

Try to locate an automotive rubber place--we found one in Phoenix--If you do
locate one - you can find New rubber that will work for less then $2.00 a
foot!! Try the yellow pages and let your fingers do the walking--I found the
rubber I needed for a Fridolin that I restored years ago !! I know it was
not 100%-- correct,- But it looked good and it sealed !!
Usually an automotive trim shop--they handle a zillion different types of
rubber for all the American cars and some "Universal" type seals--Best of
luck  "Keep Looking  "They " are Always Out There" !! TWWM, uj
