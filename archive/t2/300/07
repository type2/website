Hi Greg,

73-74 buses came with "Smog Pumps" to help reduce their emissions.

In truth, they didn't do ANYTHING to reduce emissions. They made things  
worse by robbing the vehicle of 3-4 HP  to spin a pump that injected  
clean air into ports on the exhaust manifold.

The clean air pumped into the exhaust system diluted the PPM count of  
HC, CO and NO in the exhaust enough to fool the environmental  
regulators until 1975, when it was given up in favor of a  
cleaner-running FI system. The actual AMOUNT of smog generated by the  
engine was not affected. (Unless you include the performance decrease  
the pump created, which would actually *increase* emissions.)

Some 1.7 and 1.8L heads (like the ones on my bus) still have the ports  
for the smog pump, and it's quite annoying when one comes loose. Not  
all that hard to fix, but a noisyPITA to be sure. I have never seen a  
running bus with one of these pumps still attached.

Happy trails,
