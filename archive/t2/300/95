Subject: Difference in 70 vs 71 tranny.

Mine is a 1970 bus with the original 1970 transmission and a super beetle
engine. The tranny is old and I'd like to rebuild it. I have the opportunity
to pick up a good1971 tranny to use as an interim.

I know there is a difference between a 68-70 and 71 tranny. What is it, and
is there any reason why I can't use the 1971? Would it be easier if it came
with the bell housing?

Thanks for any help and insights.
