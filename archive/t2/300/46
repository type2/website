Subject: Engine Problem

I recently had new heater exchanges and a new muffler put on to my 1972
Type III bus engine.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do the work
because of my new employment.  The shop also cleaned out the carbs.  I
picked the bus up and drove from Wisconsin to Mississippi where I now
live.  About a week ago, the engine started to back fire.  It would only
back fire once I let off the gas.  So I thought that since it had been
run in a year and a half and the long drive down, that I would change
the oil, filter and adjust the valves.  But unfortunately, it is still
back firing.  I am also noticing that it is gasping to get gas into the
engine.  I am going to make sure that heater exchangers are still on
tight as well as everything else.   Just to make sure there aren't any
vacuums.  If this doesn't work, I am going to check the timing.  Can
anyone give me some advise.  I am a new owner.  Because the engine is
1800 cc, I gapped the valves to 0.008.

Thanks for the help
