I think you might be looking at a tranny repair in the near future. Drain 
and refill the tranny with new oil - Amsoil I hear is good and I have used 
a couple synthetics from the auto parts store. I had a Moostang that howled 
so loud you couldn't talk to the passenger - and this went on for years.

Understand that I could not have repaired the tranny b/c it was so trashed 
from driving despite the noise. Don't drive yours until it is not worth 
repairing unless you've got a replacement.

As for the thermostat - I can't advise. It has been years since I played 
with Beetle motors.
