Subject: RE: [T2] Rear hatch water leak help needed

I've seen it leak from the bolts in the roof under the luggage rack and
puddle by the striker plate.  The thing to do is to get in the bus where you
can see good and have someone on the outside pour water on the bus with a
hose from different locations until you see the leak.  Then you can figure
out what to fix.
