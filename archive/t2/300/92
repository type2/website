Subject: Re: [T2] Front rubber mats,question about bench seat 

Agreed about the front rubber mats promoting rust. Everyone should have a
look under these mats- it is usually rust city under there. What I did was,
I wire wheeled all the rust off, painted the floor white with rust paint,
and left the floor bare. Every couple of days I sweep the floor off. No
moisture is trapped under rubber. Seems bound to keep my bus alive longer,
good enough reason for me.

BEWARE that the rubber mats may trap so much moisture under them in wet
weather that it may promote ALOT of rust.>
