Subject: Re: [T2] VWCamper and Commercial

there IS evidence that it is VERY alive and well. a friend of mine (i
like to think he's my friend, anyway... lol) told me this:
"Feel free to spread the word that VW C & C is alive and well.  I was
just chatting with the editor today so I know all is well there at the
moment.  He was a bit freaked out when the rumor was going around that it
was going under with the other one."
so there... *sticking tongue out*

be glad i ASKED about this situation. i could have just gone around
telling people it was going under without checking first. and i did ASK,
just to be sure... isnt that what these lists are for? so people can get
their information correct? besides, you listed yourself, how it is NOT in
danger, silly.

waving, glad i took the time to make sure i was wrong, but sorry i
started something,
chris

... now) C+C is healthy and separate to the TotalVW probs..
