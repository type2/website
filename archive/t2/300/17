Rather warm.  When I filled up, it was about 55 degrees F and I had been driving a while so everything was warmed up.  John Baker and Access Bob say the capacity is listed at 15.9 and 15.8 respectively, so I guess what I saw was in the realm of possibility.  I guess I can let the needle go to the bottom of the red zone without fear now.  :)
