Seen a couple types of the bug but this is the first bus I've seen. Your
right, would be too heavy for a key chain. This one the clock is inside the
body and the body hinges up from the center line to read the watch. Kinda
crude and with 10 windows but hey, its a bus.

> I got a little bug for my birthday a few months ago.   I was sorry it
wasn't a splittie, but it was really nice.   It is pretty hefty for only
being maybe 2" long, too heavy for a keychain IMO. The body is slightly
rough, the windows are polished and shiny, the top is a clock.  Is this
similar to the bus clock?
