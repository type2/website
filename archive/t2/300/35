You guys ('ceptin gensler) all missed the joke!
Either that or we were the only ones bored enough to
respond...more likely the latter i'd say...

The picture in the ad is that of a type4 ALTERNATOR!!
Apparently the seller either mixed up the pics or
(more excitingly) he really thought he had him one of
them there old-timey smog pumps...

Thats why greg posted it...cause it was funny.
We had good laugh over pmail...poor greg...rest his
sorry banned soul...
;-p

BTW - I sold the a-wagen step and the deluxe trim...I
think...

thanks all,
