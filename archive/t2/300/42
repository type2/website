Ya coulda always used por-15!

Anyone besides me ever try to sandblast that stuff *off* of something?

BTW, I have some of that stuff that I bought to paint my exsisting
original under the bus heater hose.  They even have instructions on the 
can about how to thin it a little in order to be able to *paint* it on 
something.

Someone should try this on their bumper and let us know how it works!

They have black, red, yellow and I think blue at the local Lowe's....never 
saw any white though.


Cheers, dave
