Subject: Re: Bosch Relays for Sale Site??

There are a slew of generic relays that will work in the same manner, with 
the same connections as the Bosches.  All of them that I've seen have the 
appropriate wiring diagram right on the side of the relay.

Your local alarm installation/car stereo places should have a bin full of 
them.  I must have pulled out 5 or 6 of them when I de-alarmed my Golf....
