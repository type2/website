thanks richard and bryant. i think i will subscribe to it now that my
subscription to VWT is up. i like the pretty pictures in VWT, but it is
like guys buying playboy... to look at pics of things they will never
have. i know i will never be able to own any of the cars featured in that
mag!

thanks for the info guys, i think i have a new VW magazine,

 According to the info I have read, the company that owns C&C also  owned
 another British VW magazine that was nixed because it wasn't making 
money.
 C&C has always had a money stream because of people who subscribe ( 
whereas
 the other mag was not subscription based ) and the explanation was  that
C&C
 won't have this problem.
