isnt this the brittish magazine someone was recently talking about being
shut down and them not getting their subscription fees back? someone
please repost this info so i can FWD it to some other people. there has
been alot of people at another club of mine recommending this magazine
and i hate to see a bunch of new people paying for a magazine that wont
be around much longer and not get a refund. many of them sound very
interested in it because it is more their style than VWT or HVW. if this
is NOT the one that was recently discussed, please tell me what was so i
wont be confused anymore. (i belong to too many lists, so i cant remember
even WHERE i saw these posts! i just hope it was here!)

thanks guys,
chris
