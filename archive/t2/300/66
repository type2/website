Subject: Heat Flaps

Hi List.  I have a 1600 DP with no thermostat.  However, I have a piece of
bailing wire from the right side of the motor to engage or disengage the heat
flap system.  My question is: which way is which?  Do I let the wire release
back to the left with the spring tension to get heat (warmup mode), or do I
pull and secure the wire to the right against the spring to get warmup mode?
I just installed an oil temp gauge, but it really never seems to warm up much
past 120 no matter what I do when it's freezing or below. Most of my trips are
real short, though.  It does make heat in the bus, but I want to make sure I'm
warming it up as fast as possible until I get around to installing a new
thermostat.  Ideas?

Also, my tranny is whining in all gears, but not popping out.  It has a very
high-pitched whine from like one-to-five MPH, then settles into more of a
gearlike hissing/whizzing sound at speed.  Power on or power off it's there,
but barely crack the throttle and it goes silent.  How long does this tranny
have to live?  130,000 on the bus, according to the speedo, and I'm the third
owner, so I think it's right.
