Hmmm.  Interesting.  I put 15.6 in mine one time (filled to the brim) -
figured I was lucky to get to the pump.  I assume VW measured the tank
without the filler neck which probably holds nearly 1/3 gallon.  Remember
too that fluids expand and contract with temperature.  How's the weather
down in Texas these days?
