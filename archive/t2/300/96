Subject: 72 front bumper for sale

I have a 72 (fits 68-72) front bumper for sale that is in
excellent condition. It has the rubber for the wrap around
steps. It has been fully restored and painted white. No
rust, no dents. It can be shipped UPS to anywhere in the
USA. It is currently in Florida. I am moving and don't need
this bumper. Contact me at vwbus1972(-at-)yahoo.com or
239-213-0645 (EST). I am asking $150 plus shipping. It's in
perfect shape.
