Subject: And the winner is! (was: wiper doesn't wipe.)

Stripped splines!
Since I didn't have an empty beer can, I quickly emptied one out.  Then I
grabbed a plastic soda pop bottle, cut an inch square piece of plastic and
softened it with my lighter.  After I put it on the stripped spline, I put
the wiper arm on it popping a perfect hole in the plastic for the nut and
tightened the sucker on. It works perfectly now, and I'll report how long it
lasts. Plastic is supposed to last 10,000 years ya know.

I'll be selling these repair kits at a swap meet near you.  You'll get an
empty plastic soda bottle, a lighter, and my best wishes for only $20.00.
All VW logos will be removed from the plastic and lighter prior to sale to
meet with VWOA regulations. :-)
