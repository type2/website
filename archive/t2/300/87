Subject: Is a aircooled vanagon ECU different between automatic and

The injection systems between the air-cooled manual and automatic
transmissions (federal model) are identical except the A/t does not have a
deceleration valve........

The A/T van that I currently am restoring had a dead ECU...............no
pulse at the injectors, but at the cold start valve...............so, we
swapped ECU's with a good manual transmission one, and it seems low on
power...........

I know in the Bay window busses they had different ECU's....I figure this
probably had something to do with duration of the injector pulse, or
something..........

Any advice is appreciated.
