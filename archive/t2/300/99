Subject: A note about the free stuff

Hello List,

I just wanted to let every one know that I am sorry
for the bad email regarding the free stuff. Yes, I am
still going to send everything that I promised.  I
have had alot of stuff taking my time over the last
week or so and have not had to chance to do much
shipping. About the shipping that I said was required
for some of the heaver items, I am going to go ahead
and ship everything and then let those people know
what the ammount is. Here is what I want you to do.
Instead of sending it to me, send that ammount (even
more would be even better) as a donation to the type 2
list. It would also be nice if some of the other
people that receives stuff could send the list a small
donation. It is just a suggestion. I will ship
everything when I can. Sorry for the delay!!

Have a great day!

David Kelly
