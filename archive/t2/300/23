Subject: Re: [T2] Gas tank capacity

After draining the tank,,, and replacing my fuel lines,, I put in 60 liters. So
when ever I pumped 58 or 59 liters,, I knew I was tempting fate,,, then one day
I put in almost 66 liters,,,
That is when I started to believe that there are inaccurate pumps!

I complained to the attendant, who started spewing things like calibration at 20
deg C  and it was alot colder,, etc,, A day later I stopped in to see the owner,
and he gladly gave me a refund for the 6 liters that couldn't have possibly been
hidden in the filler neck! No questions asked,, like he didn't want me to stir
up anything,,

I thought about reporting it,, but didn't.   That station isn't there anymore...
wonder why?
