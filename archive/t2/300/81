Subject: main fuse

I found the following on the Daniel Stern Lighting website:

http://lighting.mbz.org/tech/relays/relays.html

"And if you own an old classic without any sort of main fuse
or total-circuit protection, the entire wiring harness can be
quick-fried to a crackling, crunchy crisp in a matter of seconds.
I have seen/smelled/heard this happen, and it is not soon forgotten.
(Incidentally--if you drive such a car, ADD A MAIN FUSE OR
FUSIBLE LINK!)"

How large of a main fuse (breaker) would be appropriate for a bus,
with 55w headlights and a restrained stereo?
