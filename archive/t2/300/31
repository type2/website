Subject: Weber ICT34 jets and fuel tank sender replacement

Two unrelated questions:

First, I'm about to replace my good ol' Weber progressive with a pair of Weber
34 ICTs I picked up of the unnamed auction site. The 34s came off a dual-port
upright (I even have the manifolds if anyone is interested in them). Should I
expected to have to reject these puppies? If so, anybody have the jet sizes
handy?

Second, I saw a site a few months ago that detailed how to cut a port in the
bed area about the fuel tank to give access to the fuel guage sender without
removing the tank. Does anybody remember that site? I need to replace/repair
my sender but don't want to drop the engine if I can avoid it.
