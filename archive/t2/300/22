Subject: Anyone have any bumper impact strips? :(

Hey all,

I just got some sweet Chrome overriders, and they are sweet. Only problem is 
that they are for a Champagne II edition bumper, hence they don't grlove in 
for the groove across the bumpers, they groove out for use with an impact 
strip:(

Anyone got any front or rear impact strips, or know of a good way to make 
some decent fakies?

Thanks a bunch!
