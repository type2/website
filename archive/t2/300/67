I emailed them because they seemed to have identical items (330-073 and 330-070) at different prices.  Does anyone know why?

--- the reply I received from partsexpress ---

Hello! 

So far as I can discern, the only real difference between the two 
relays is the price! I don't know why we carry two so similar, other 
than the fact that Bosch does enjoy a fair amount of namebrand 
loyality. You should find no difference in quality or function between 
the two. I would go with the cheaper! 

Thanks! Let me know your further questions.
