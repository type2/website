Subject: gen to alt conversion

sorry if this has already been discussed, but i have a long trip next
weekend (about 8 hours?) and i cant seem to get anyone to hook up the
wires on my alt so i can drive my bus (newly rebuilt engine, hasnt been
driven yet).

anyway, i have a 1970 bus, stock engine, had to switch out my gen cuz the
gen light was staying on and the battery wasnt getting charged. got the
alt from the bug in the bus and now i dont know what wires to hook up or
how! i know i have to bypass the voltage regulator, but aside from
that... i have NO clue!

i am not a mechanic, so please speak in layman's terms (ie: big red wire,
little green wire, push on plug, bolt on connector, etc....)

thanks for your expertise...
