I just put a vintage, new in the box K-Mart 8 track tape player (got it =
on E-B**) in my 72 Westy with a cheapo set of door mounted speakers. You =
know- the kind where the knobs stick out about two inches from the face =
plate? Cost me about 40 bucks total. Sound quality? Yeah right.... But =
it's got character!=20

Throw in one of those K-Tel music mix tapes with Tony Orlando singin =
"Tie a yellow ribbon" and you are there, man! On the other hand, maybe =
that explains why so many of those 1970's bussers decided to get stoned =
instead.... ;-)

Serious bus content and question: I've got a European 72 bus with what =
appears to be a pre 72 brake system installed. (no vacuum servo and the =
brake resovoir installed on the front inner wall (by the drivers knee). =
When ordering rear brake cylinders would the appropriate part be for a =
70-71 bus or should I go ahead and order for a 72?  In other words are =
the rear brake cylenders more dependent on year model or the fact that =
you have/don't have a servo assisted system? (71 vs. 72 shows different =
part numbers)

TIA,

John B.
