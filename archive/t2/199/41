Will work for the most part in those too, they rebroadcast the signal
from ground stations too in a lot of areas to help eliminate that
problem as much as possible, now obviously tunnels and such will be a
problem regardless of what you do, but radio doesn't work there either.

HOW???  The signal is coming from two satellites stationed in 
geosynchronous orbit (22,000 miles high) with clear view of rural 
areas,   canyons and mountain passes.  If you can see the sky, you can 
receive the signal.  You'd have possible problems in parking structures
and 
tunnels, but what radio works in those?

Now if you want to pay the 10 bucks a month to receive the signal,
that's 
another story.
