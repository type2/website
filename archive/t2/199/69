Subject: Adjusting the clutch

I spent a "fun" couple of hours on Sunday adjusting Ashley's clutch. This
should be a easy job I thought but it is a devil to get at and I suspect
this means I'm doing this the wrong way.

What i did was the remove the wheel, and sit the bus on an axle stand.
clamp some grips on the ferrule to stop the cable turning and then reached
under to squeeze the clamp and clutch lever so the nut was turnable.
Trouble is I could squeeze but needed a second hand to turn the nut. This
meant a second person as event at 6ft3 I couldn't find any way of reaching
around to get both hands to the job.

Is there an easier way ?

On the plus side, my gears no longer crunch and I took the opportunity to
drain and re-fill the gearbox with Morris GL4 from the VW Flaps. I also put
in some Lolyslip 'cos I did my bug with this 10+ years ago and have never
had a problem. I know it is probably snake oil but I don't carry a rabbits
foot and I like to think it is doing some good. Besides, it's been around
since the 70's so is a true period accessory for '71 bus :-))

Best of all I found the slightly loose heat exchanger and no longer have
the annoying exhaust putter that was sooooo difficult to track down.
