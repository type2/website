Subject: RE: [T2] engine install issues

Gypsy,

Lots and lots of axel lube. I accidentally got mine stuck between the
bellhousing and the engine one time, so now the cable is perminatly
kinked(I know they are cheap, im just too lazy to replace it at the
moment.) But, I had a very hard time getting it through til I doused the
end in thick axel grease, and the thing slid right through.
