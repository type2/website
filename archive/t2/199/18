Subject: Re: [T2] Remote Starter Switch

Sorry about that, I thought you wanted a permenent one.  Of course, you can
buy remote starter switches anywhere, but try to find one with the longest
leads (wires) you can, getting all the way under the engine is a long way.
This should be something you carry in your tool box.  The last one I
purchased, I got at Sears and it had an almost 6 foot lead on it.  It also
had a small LED on it to let you know you had power.

When hooking up the clips, you can do both at the starter, one clip goes on
the small wire coming out the top of the starter, the other goes on the
large red wire coming from the battery.
