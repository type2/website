Subject: Re: [T2] hooking up second battery

Personally i dont recommend using the starting battery for anything when 
you are parked.  However a 71 is probably a lot easier to push start 
than my 82 westy.  I use a power inverter on my aux battery for most 
things.  this is because the inverter has a cutoff for low voltage which 
prevents me from draining the battery far enough to be a loading problem 
on the alternator.  constant draining of a standard auto battery and 
recharging does shorten the life of the battery as well.
