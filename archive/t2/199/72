Jason, good to hear back from you, but you still have some misconseptions
about the oil.  Only a few drops of oil ever reach the heads, try taking off
the valve covers and running the engine some time, you will only see small
drops come splattering off the rockers, not near enough to cool a 400 degree
head!!  The oil is for lubbing and cooling the lower end, not cooling the
end that makes the heat.

Jake Raby said it very well the other day, HIGH RPM's heat up the oil, LOW
RPM's heat up the heads.  Therefore, keeping the RPM's around 3800 will keep
your engine as cool as possible.

Last summer on a 140,000 mile 2L engine, I pulled a 1300 lb Scamp trailer
with my westy loaded with camping gear and 4 adults through your Cal desert.
I went from lower Arizona to LA then back to Kansas, over mountain passes
and all with no overheating problem.  I have put an additional 25,000 on
that engine pulling my trailer with no problems.  Of course the engine is in
good tune, I run the 50w racing oil and Lucas.  I also drive the bus as it
was meant to be driven.

Have fun on your Baha trip, sounds like a really great time!!
