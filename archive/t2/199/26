Hi Listee's, 

I've recently acquired a '73 Campmobile that I was planning to use for
parts. It's complete and in better shape than I anticipated. So it got
me thinking..  Now the frame that holds the torsion tube at the back is
rusted out and has partially collapsed, sagging the rear end. Is this a
fatal blow to the van or can this be sectioned out with a new piece from
a donor van? I'm not interested in the legality of the procedure, just
whether or not it is feasible, (worth the effort), or if anyone else has
done this.

 

Thanks,

Rob
