Subject: New Engine????

I live in the seattle area, so I'm looking for a good shop, besides the 
awesome bowow shop!  That i might find an engine for my 75 westy.  I have 
found a few engines on line but i don't want to drive 6000 miles.  The engine 
in now is great but slowly going down hill, and i dont know the history of 
the engine, so i have little trust...  Or maybe i could have it rebuilt????
