Subject: Re: [T2] Sparkplugs 1700cc

I found a FLAPS problem with that year.  checked my own store and it 
only gives the 1600 engine.  called another up the street and it also 
only gives the 1600 engine.  went to bosch site and it also only gives 
the 1600 engine.  According to the VW parts list which i cant tell which 
engine is which at the moment it lists w8ac, w7ac and w7cc bosch 
numbers. there were two 1700cc engines and a 1600 engine in that year.  
You have presented me with an interesting start point because spark 
plugs are one of the items to add to my tech site.
