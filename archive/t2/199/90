Hello Guys and dolls       Which pilot bearing are you doing?if it's the type 
4 ( 72 bus ) then you can try the packing grease trick. I use a bearing 
puller made just for this job.  there are at least two types, one with 
fingers that you tighten down and it pulls the bearing out,and the slide 
hammer type, which I find to work the best. If you are talking the type 1 
just get another gland nut. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
