Hi Sean,

Yeah, it seems to be an unusual system. My understanding is that up to
70 you had the resevoir by the drivers knee, 71 moved the resevoir
behind the drivers seat and from 72 you got the vacuum assist and discs.

I'm guessing but what I think may be the case is that the Westy busses
(Non US Spec., anyway) were pulled over onto on a different assembly
line and produced at a lower rate. In 1972 when they did my bus (and
probably others)they still had older parts in stock that they continued
to use until they were exhausted or received new assembly diagrams or
something.

Maybe the rear brake cylinder part number is also related to whether
you've got discs (mine does) up front or drums?? Maybe vacuum assist was
only included on busses with type 4 engines??? Any other Euro bussers
out there?

John B.
