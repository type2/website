Does not matter how much advance or retard or overlap you have, basic cam
timing is still in the ballpark to check for TDC on the opposing cylinder.

I did not mention the Mercedes 5 cyl. diesel....its firing order is 12453 or
any other overhead cam engine. On any overhead cam engine, all you have to
look at are the lobes for the cylinder you are wanting to know about. If they
are both up, like rabbit ears, then you are on that cylinders TDC.
