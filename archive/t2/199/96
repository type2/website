Subject: Re: [T2] grinding in 2nd

Worn tranny synchronizers, poorly adjusted clutch, poorly adjusted shifter, 
worn shifter coupler, dirty oil in the tranny (GL-4 spec only!).

Start with the easiest and cheapest solutions and work up.

I suspect a worn tranny synchronizer. This is not a normal problem if the 
tranny is in good condition, yours is either the victim of a hard driving 
PO or many, many miles.

I would stop shifting down into 2nd and experiment to see if you can find a 
good way to shift into second from first without noises. If you cannot you 
will need a tranny repair or replacement.
