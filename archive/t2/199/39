I'm not sure if I'll just use a simple lube on the next set of tube rings.
The last engine I installed new rings in, as I have always done, I used some
wheel bearing grease on the 3/4 side of the engine, but used some aviation
permatex on the 1/2 side.

After 25,000 miles, the grease only side is slightly oily while the permatex
side is BONE dry.  I know the tubes will be a bit harder to get back out,
but I have built a puller that expands on the inside and pulls them that
way, so I don't think it will be a problem.

I think on the next engine, I think I will be using a light coating of
sealer.
