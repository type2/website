Subject: Remote Starter Switch

Back in the old days when I had my 62 camper, I recall having a remote
hand-held switch. It was a black plastic cylinder with a push-button and
a two long wires with alligator clips. If memory serves, one was clipped
to the solonoid and one to the battery. Then, by pressing the button
with your thumb, you could bump the starter while working in the engine
compartment or adjusting valves under the car. Anyone know if these
still exist?
Thanks,
