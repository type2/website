Problem solved.  Even though I had used a clutch alignment tool, I figured that
the only thing that could be wrong was the alignment even though the tool would
glide right in.  I separated the bus from the engine to give myself enough
working room, stuck the alignment tool in, loosened the pressure plate, spun
the disk around,  tightened the pressure plate and removed the tool.  I then
rolled the bus back into the engine and it all went right together.

Don't ask me why this worked because from all indications the clutch was
properly aligned to begin with.

Thanks for the responses.
