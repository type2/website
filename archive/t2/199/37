This is a little off the deep end for push rod tube
seal installation. Kind of like where the discussions
go for Porsche - you only need a simple lubricant to
install these seals, like a drop of oil off your dipstick.
Otherwise, this expensive sealer is suitable for the task
at hand-it is a gooey silicone paste, also ok for food
preparation and suba gear. The next better sealer would be
Dow Corning 112 High Consistency Valve Sealant, it has
a higher temperature range ( 500F vs. 400F :)
These o-rings were not designed to require glue.
( You stop one leak, it comes out somewhere else :).
