Dormobile roof widow seals are availlable from www.justkampers.com, the tax you will get knocked off for an outside of EU purchase will be (I guess) about the same as postage;
and ordering with your credit card over the net is easy. 
I've dealt with them many times over the last 10 years and have found them to be reliable, and helpfull.

Good luck

The land rover dormobile pop tops are they the same window seals and vent seals? I really could use new replacements, and having a little difficulty locating seals in the States.
