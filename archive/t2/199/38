I mounted it in front of the driver side rear wheel. It is between two of
the cross
supports ( I do not know the technical name for them). The most rear of the
two
cross supports is the one that has the jack insertion point. I took some
digital photos
and will try to post to www.kazmal.net/buscooler.html

>and how you protect it from getting hit by stones, etc.

In terms of protection from rocks I read that this is fairly tough material
and figured I
might get a bent fin or two but .... I guess you could mount a cage along
with the cooler
to the frame??

I used rubber. However, several articles I have read recommend braided. I
priced them in one place
and the were very expensive. When I have time to shop around I will
probably replace
with braided. I mounted the remote filter on the fram as well. The plumbing
for a type 4 2 liter
is as follows:
(1)Remove stock filter and spin on oil filter block off which has an in and
out marked
(2) run line from out to remote filter inlet
(3) run line from filter outlet to cooler in
(4) run from cooler back to block off inlet.

I did not buy the thermostat - I live in northern Cal. and did not think I
needed it.
The one thing I worried about was that the run was too long and I would lose
oil pressure. Since I increased the volume of oil ( a little more than a
quart) and
lowered the temp. my pressure gauge is showing nice pressure. I am running
straight
40 weight.

Oh yeah the dimensions are: 96 Plate  (Measurements: 1.5" X 11" X 11")  >
