what it sounds like is your shifter is out of alignment and what your
doing is going 3-4-3-4  starting in 3rd gear shifting to 4th and then when
you shift to 3rd the second time it works correctly

do you have the Bentley manual, if not get one. 

check chapter 6 section 3.4 page 9 where it describes how to adjust the
linkage especially the adjustment of (fig 3.14) stop plates 9 or 9a

should be a fairly simple repair. easy once you have done it a few times,
frustrating and tricky the first time.  but not hard and you don't have to
drop the engine or anything.  But don't drive like that if you can help it
as it will wear the clutch out real fast and lug the engine (not a good
thing) and then you will have to drop the engine...

also check your clutch adjustment but that shouldn't be an effect on the
shifting linkage

good luck and welcome to the funny farm
