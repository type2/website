Subject: Re: [T2] New Engine????

If you know the history of the engine you now have your probably better off 
either rebuilding it or having it done. If you have taken reasonably good 
care of it,  check out the prices now. To what degree do you work on your 
Westy?.  I have pulled the heads myself and paid about $125 per head to have 
them rebuilt. I have found the bottom half of a 2 Ltr.engine to be pretty 
much bulletproof Iv'e had a couple last me over 200k (oh ya, and a set of 
rings once). The killer cost isto have them R&R the engine.
Hope you find a economic and satifying solution.
