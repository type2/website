Sorry, I hit send too soon, here is my complete answer.

Why do you need to bypass the voltage regulator?  Do you have an internally
regulated alternator?  If you don't have the experience to wire this
yourself, you may need to hit a salvage yard and check out some wiring on
other busses and maybe purchase the wire harness and voltage regulator for
the alternator style engine from a salvage bus.

It's not that hard to make up a wire harness if you use a Bentley and follow
the wiring diagram.  You will need to purchase the correct gauge of wire and
some terminal connectors.  I would suggest getting the correct color (no
striped colors, just solid colored) wire so the next time you hook it up it
will be easier.
