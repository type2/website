Bob, 


No, it only seemed to happen after I had cut the bus off. Otherwise 
everything seemed fine back there while the bus was moving or sitting...
I got under there and poked around pretty good. I dont see any oil leaking at 
all except a very minor amount at the oil screen gasket. (Bad mechanic.) 
The areas where my heat exchangers are look good, oil free and everything 
else on this motor is really really clean.
