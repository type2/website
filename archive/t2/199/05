Subject: Re  Oil Temp Sensor


Bob: My son and I had a similar experience in a T2 leaving LA for a 
cross-country trip in July  several years ago. 106 degrees as we 
headed up toward Vegas. Almost immediately, the Berb flicker 
occurred.  We paniced and then calmed down when we decided that 225 
degrees was  uncomfortable, but no cause for alarm.

We traveled to Virginia with that flicker happening frequently.  Tens 
of thousands of miles have been put on that (Berg) engine since then. 
No ill effects.

Running temp is much like choice of distributors or of oil. Everyone 
has a strong opinion. My opinion is that the Berg sensor is set too 
low and therefore it is too bothersome.

In my own '71 Westy with a 1776 I gutted the Berg dip stick and 
replaced the sensor with a thermocouple, which I read out at the 
dashboard with a DVM. When I want to check my oil temp, I can do so.

Hope this helps. Jack

I recently installed the Berg mechanical style oil temp switch/sender 
that mounts into the dip stick tube. Bus us stock engine 1600 SP in 
1970 Westy.

Drove I-10 yesterday afternoon in the peak heat of the day to Winnie, 
TX, and then down to the High Island area for an afternoon of BBQ, 
Beer, and night time Fireworks at my friend's beach house.
