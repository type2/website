Subject: Re: [T2] Any suggestions part two

For any cylinder, to see if it is at TDC to fire, always check the valves 180
away from it. For # 1, check #3. If #3 valves are rocking [the exhaust just
closed and the intake just started to move] then #1 is at TDC. If #4 is
rocking then #2 is at TDC.

Doesn't matter what engine you have: If a Chevy V8 with a firing order of
18436572, them 6 is 180 from 1. If an odd-fire Buick V6 which is 165432, then
4 is 180 from 1. Even-fire V6 is 153624, 6 is 180 from 1. Mercedes and Ford,
15486372, 6 is 180 from 1.
R10 Renault and Jaguar are goofy.....#1 is at the flywheel, like VW.
