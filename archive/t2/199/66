I don't have any way of judging engine temp. in my '71 Westy.  I wanted to put one in though, because I'm kind of worried about it over-heating.  What are my options?  I wanted a needle and tack more than a warning light, so I can watch it rise/lower depending on how I'm driving.   My dash clock doesn't have any arms on it, so I think whoever bought it bought it without one (I think those dash clocks were optional, right?) and I was wondering if I could use that little circle in the dash board for my temp. gauge.
