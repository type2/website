Subject: 79 Bus Windshield Washer

I'm waiting for my Bentley to arrive and wondered if anyone can give me
a description of how the windshield washer is pumped and plumbed on this
bus. All my previous VWs used air pressure, but this one doesn't seem to
have a valve. Is the fluid pumped electrically? When I pull the arm I
hear no noise and no fluid is pumped.
