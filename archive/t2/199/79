Subject: Re: [T2] RE: hole in tin??

That hole is where the wire for the head temp sensor goes thru on a 75 1800 FI
engine. 76 and up 2.0L, the temp sensor was moved to the tin screw hole next
to the port. Just about all 3/4 upper tin have a plug in that hole, up to the
end of 78?....I have not seen it on 79's.
