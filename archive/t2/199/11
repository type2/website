===================>
Oh Oh,
Given this info, I think I have to go to an assumption that is pretty bad...
That being ... "My buses cannot be driven in Texas heat."

But I do drive in Texas heat, and I have not had a temp related 
problem,,,,,, so far.

Yes, I agree that measuring the oil is the way to go, (sense the heat 
transfer fluid before the heat gets transferred) but it just seems to me 
that a set point of 227 degrees is a number that only allows me to be out 
on the road with the vampires.

Others ??
Please jump in with personal experiences or knowledge.
