Subject: RE: [T2] needle bearing woes 

I'm assuming you're talking about the pilot bearing in the gland nut and not 
the needle bearing in the front axle. I've never tried this myself but I 
hear the trick is to fill the space in the nut and bearing with grease, then 
tap a dowel or drift of the appropriate size (as close to the I.D. of the 
bearing as possible) into the hole. The grease, being noncompressible, will 
force the needle bearing out of its recess. Don't wear your Sunday clothes 
for this.

If you haven't measured the crankshaft endplay, do so now. If it's out you 
will have to shim it, which requires removing the gland nut, and you could 
replace the bearing much more easily then.

Let me know if the grease thing works, OK?
