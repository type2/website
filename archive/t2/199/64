Ok I have a wierd problem that I can live with, but I drive over the mountains so it's kind of a bad thing.

My bus has a habbit of not working in first or second gear some times.  Normally I just push the clutch in and just wiggle the stick around and try again, but when I'm downshifting going up hill in the mountains I live in, this isn't an option.  I'm not sure what the problem is, but let me describe what happens the best I can:

If I'm leaving a stop sign, say, I'll let the clutch out and gas it down just like normal, but it will stall like I've dropped the cluth OR it will bounce really hard on me, and barely move along with no power, and the engine is really bogged down, and then eventually I can shift into 2nd, but when I do it's like the RPMs are the same, until I shift into 3rd then it has a little kick and the engien doesn't sound like it's bogging down any more and it works fine.  The same thing might happen going from 3rd to 2nd, which is the major problem since I can't have that happening on mountains.

The only theory I could think of (keep in mind I'm 16, I've only been playing cars for a few months now so it might seem very stupid) is that the transmission is grabbing a combination of first and second gear, but I can't see how that would be possible so I'm not sure what it is.  Some of my friends say it's the cross linkage, but I don't know how that works so I'm not sure if they're right or what...plus I don't really know much about tramissions or transaxles (VWs have transaxels right?) so I have no idea what's wrong or how to fix it...it's not me doing it, because it's done it to my cousin and stepdad when they drive it, so it's the  car, not the driver...any help?  Has this happened to anybody before?

A friend of mine with a bug, who doesn't know anything about cars, said her bug did that (at least we think it might be teh same thing) until her Dad got her a new transaxel and it stopped...

Any help?  I'm completely baffled.
