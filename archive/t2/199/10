Glad you posted this. I'm heading to Baja where temps are often over
100, and also have a 79. I have a 1.5 quart extra sump that I have to
yank because it hangs too low for off-road in Baja, so I need to add a
cooler. I've been looking at the coolers online and wondering which is
best. The BusBoys plate style cooler looks good, but they sure don't
tell you much about it. Would very much appreciate it if you could tell
me anything you can about it, like:  exactly where and how you mounted
it, and how you protect it from getting hit by stones, etc. Did you use
rubber or braided lines? Did you buy the thermostat and, if so, what are
the dimensions? How is the thing plumbed into the motor and where did
you find a protected place to mount the remote filter? 

Any help you can give would be great. Thanks,
