Subject: flexible Borescope?

Sears.com sells Borescopes. A very cool looking tool...(pun intended!)

Has anyone used one of these (or similar?)

It sure looks handy for peering into cylinders, up behind the dash, 
and everywhere your head doesn't fit...pricey but could be useful if 
they actually work...
