Hi Roger,

Upgrading from 1.8 to 2L is easily done; I did the same back in 2003.  
If you are running the original dual solex carbs, you will need to  
increase the main jets up from a 130 to to a 132.5. You can get the  
new jets from www.germanSupply.com or from any local Yamaha  
motorcycle supplier; the solex carbs use the same jets as Mikuni  
carbs, and a bike shop should have lots of different sizes in stock.  
I ran the dual-solex 2L config for a year before I upgraded to L- 
jetronic fuel injection, and it ran fine once I had the carbs dialed in.

One other thing... Keep the transmission studs from your existing  
engine before you send the core back, because in my experience the  
studs used on a 2L are intended for a different transmission and are  
too short for the 5-rib or 3-rib bell housing.

Happy Trails,
