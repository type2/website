FYI,

There is a seller on eBay who sells the LM-1 for $280. However, they  
are not an authorized reseller and Innovate will not provide  
technical or warranty support for their products.

These units can be identified by missing a serial numbers on both the  
unit and the box (a detail left out of the auctions).
