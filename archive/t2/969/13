Subject: needle sizes for WI

I copy my answer to an individual inquirer:

	What size needle to use depends on where you're putting it. 
The single Brazilian Weber I have on my 1600 DP has no hi-vac nozzle 
for the dizzie (but a mysterious lo-vac single nozzle which somehow 
controls advance & retard).  The suction there is so low no needle 
will give a significant water feed rate.
	But it would appear from the T2 website that VW used various 
different methods for carb-dizzie vac, and it may be that some had 
the hi-vac nozzle so common on other Solex etc carbs.
	If on the other hand you slap the water in after the carb, 
i.e in the start of the inlet manifold just inside the throttle 
butterfly, 0.51mm ("25 gauge") is about right.  There's a power of 
suction there!
	If you lack a metal nozzle on that inlet horn (for brake 
assist or whatever), you can drill a small hole and epoxy in your 
needle.  Get the end of the needle as near as possible to the 
mid-line.

	Do let me know how you get on.  And please start measuring 
your fuel consumption accurately asap, so as to establish a figure 
before the water decreases consumption.
