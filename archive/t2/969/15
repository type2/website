Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Bus locks

Hi Luis,

Remove the rear hatch lock handle. there's a 4-digit code on the  
side. That is the code for the key.  Send that code to Steve at  
www.steveslockshop.com and he can cut you a replacement key for a  
reasonable cost, and ship it fedex so it gets to you quickly.

Enjoy your new ride.

Happy Trails,
