well apparently the preson who sold me the transimssion I just put into my
bus considers "in good condition" to mean only in reverse.. since that is
the only direction it will go................

which brings the next point

Anyone in the Mid Atlantic Area have a GOOD working .010 late bay auto
transmission avaliable for a reasonable price??

anyone able to do a decent rebuild in a reasonable period of time at a
fair price??

shall I spit into the wind also????

mumble mumble grumble grumble.... at least the other one went both ways,
if not very well.........

got some good cores??

Bob
