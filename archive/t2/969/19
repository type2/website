Hmm.. I wonder if those were warranty units or something.. anyways, it's 
a great unit!  For those of you that are considering Megasquirt, the 
LC-1 is a great way to go.  Doesn't have the meter like the LM-1, but 
that's where the laptop comes in.

Also, if you want, you can get an LC-1 and utilize a cheap-o AFR meter 
and get the same kinds of readings...
