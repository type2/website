Subject: Running without oil

Ugggggh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

My wife ran our bus for almost 3 minutes without oil. This was the time it
took for me to run out of the house screaming TURN IT OFF!!!! Several times
while flailing my arms around.

 

All she said that it was hard to crank and then it started.

 

After a lot of jumping around on another matter, I settled down and realized
that it really did not sound all that bad, I mean the engine did sound
normal and it was not overly clattery.

 

Please, someone tell me how to proceed from here.

 

First I am going to get oil into it. Then I will do the psi testing for the
cylinders. They were 125,125,125 and 120 for #3.

 

I hope they are the same.

 

I am assuming these engines are tough, real tough.
