You are correct in that you can't do a complete and comprehensive rebuild of 
an engine at a price that's cheaper than buying a longblock from one of the 
volume rebuilders.  Assuming you have the tools and the skills and the 
desire you might build a better engine at the price (no value attributed to 
your time) but you're just not going to build it cheaper.
