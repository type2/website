Subject: Re: [T2] two vacuum nipples(heehee) on throttle body

jeremiah asked:


 on my 75 automatic i am currently running a dizzy for a 76 which has only the vacuum advance on it.  should i
plug the vacuum nipple(what's the other word for this. i forget) on the bumper side of the throttle body?
would not plugging this affect power or acceleration?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The single vac dist is mid 76 [1/76 and up] and times at 7.5 before.

Yes, definitely cap the nipple on the throttle housing.

No, capping will not affect power or acceleration.
Leaving it open will affect idle mixture and idle speed.

Timing your engine to the correct specs for the dual vac dist will severely retard it, if you use the single
one. This is why you always time the engine to the dist you have.
