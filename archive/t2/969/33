After you add the bung for the O2 sensor the LM-1 is very plug and  
play. If you just want to check the AFR once in a while you can't  
beat it for ease of use.

I don't recommend the LC-1 to anyone unless they are considering a  
permanent install and want to purchase of the Nordskog display gauges  
that Innovate now sells ($289 vs. $349 for LM-1).

I say this because of all the wiring involved and the fact that there  
is only a single flashing LED that is not part of the LC-1 (you have  
to mount it somewhere) to get any status from the sensor. Logworks  
will tell you when the heater is warming up but I still prefer the  
LM-1 display.

If you are trying to save some money by using your laptop as the  
display in a non-permanent install, I still recommend the LM-1 for  
its ease of use. While it is interesting to view the laptop's on  
screen gauges, logging is still possible with the LM-1 via download.

I also find the Logworks software very finicky.
