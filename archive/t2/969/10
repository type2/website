Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel smell and replacing rubber filler neck

One of the problems in the Seattle area is a certain
line of gas pump nozzles that require some strange
contortions in order to get the nozzle in far enough
to activate it. For several years, almost all gas
stations in the Puget Sound area used those nozzles,
with an extremely thick and non-flexible sleeve that
provided vacuum to slurp up any potential spilled fuel
and of course, fumes. In more recent times, a much
lighter and easier to operate vapor recovery nozzle /
hose system has emerged and is prevalent enough that
bus owners can choose to go to a station that has
these.

The offending nozzles did, indeed, cause excess strain
on the rubber elbows. That said, my bus went nearly
twenty years with the original elbow, but only months
with probably the next 6 or 7 - some over a year, but
none satisfactory except the one presently in there
which is several years old and still intact. I do
remember that the ones that did not last long cost me
anywhere from $6 to $12 each and the current one cost
around $35. It could be that I was getting some
inferior products. I was told by my FLAPS that they
were no longer available (several years back) and then
when they became available again, they were at the
significantly higher price, but no mention was made of
their sourcing. -BaH
