Subject: Re: [T2] Checking for Ripped Filler Elbow

I should have mentioned this earlier: If your rubber
elbow at the filler neck is ripped, you can usually
see it if you use a flashlight and look carefully
after removing the gas cap. If you can't see a
problem, stick your finger in there and poke around.
Be aware that the metal pipe comes in from the right
(forward) side and although it is not sharp, you
should be careful of it. When I have had ripped
elbows, I have found them instantly this was, as they
were easily 2- or 3-finger cracks. (No. Just let it
go!) -BaH
