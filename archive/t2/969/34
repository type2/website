I would beg to differ.  I currently have the LC-1 installed and use an 
inexpensive AFR 10-led meter that is made to read narrowband (0-1v) 
meters and it works great.  While it may not show me my AFR to the 
decimal, it does give me the AFR range that I want to see (20:1 - 10:1), 
which is all I really need to know.  I do have the megasquirt helping 
things out, but it's only controlling the mixture based on the output 
from the LC-1.  The reason I am able to do this is because the LC-1 has 
two analog outputs - one that goes to the megasquirt (0-5v) and one that 
goes to the meter (0-1v).

I never have to hook up the laptop, and I RARELY have to deal with the 
LED.  I think I looked at it while I was installing it and another time 
to calibrate it.  It's mounted in the engine compartment anyways...

It's all the price of convenience - 200 for a LC-1 or 350 for a LM-1 
that does essentially the same thing with a big meter.  But if you're 
pretty technically savvy and would like a more custom installation while 
spending less $$$, I'd definitely recommend the LC-1 and a cheap-o AFR 
meter to install in your dash.
