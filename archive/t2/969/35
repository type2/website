I installed one last month. It works just fine but it's more for the  
person who likes a wiring project in my opinion.

Once thing I thought was a little deceptive were the photos:

The quickstart guide shows 3 views of the same thing and they are  
careful to hide all the exposed wires that are actually part of the  
cable.

The LM-1 also captures log info without the use of a laptop.

I built a project box for the LC-1 to give it some portability so I  
have an idea of which one I think is more convenient.

You mean $150 vs. a lot of wiring effort? That's all I'm saying: LM-1  
is plug and play: you have to pay for it but it's worth it.

If I had a Megasquirt, I'd go with the LC-1.
