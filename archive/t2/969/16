Hi Volks,
 
I was in Sicily last week and saw an early 70's
hardtop camper owned by a US sailor...it had a GITMO
sticker on the back.  Aside from it's recent use as
a terrorist warehouse, GITMO has been a US navy base
for decades.  I had to laugh at the thought of this
guy
making the navy ship his bus all over the world
wherever they sent him (most folks just buy a local
car)
 
Down to business...I've got a fresh paint job, which
unfortunately didn't include the channels for the
door/hatch seals.  Some of the old adhesive is still
there, and pretty hard...it does NOT want to come
off. It looks like my two choices are...

1) Glue the new seals on top of the old adhesive
residue, and hope it holds up.  I'm leary of this
because the seals are expensive and don't want them
falling off in six months.

2) Grind off the old adhesive, along with the
original paint most likely. Then prime and paint the
channels,and install the new seals.  Downside here is
that I remove the factory paint and maybe open myself
up to rust down the line.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Rick
