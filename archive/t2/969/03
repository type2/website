Steve Humphrey (Pine Beetles) in Pine, CO (303-838-7218) will rebuild your
tranny for around $500 bones. He has a big following in the West and an
impeccable reputation. You can drop off your tranny at NuVintage in Arvada
and he'll pick it up and deliver it back so you. You can drop it off at his
shop, but trying to find Pine, CO is quite an experience. It is a fun trip
though.

Or, you could do the exchange through Ron at Bus Depot. His transmissions
also have an impeccable reputation.

So what is one typically looking at to have a tranny
rebuilt? I know mine needs to be done, but I thought I
was looking at about $1000-$1200.
