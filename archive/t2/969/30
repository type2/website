Subject: Sliding door adjustment

Hey all,

The sliding door on my '76 Westy doesn't close well. It wants to pop open
unless I push the back of the door and close it just right. It appears that
the locking plate (as the Bentley refers to it) on the front door jamb is too
high. I've adjusted the locking plate several times, but it doesn't work right
for long. I've read the article in the archives and in the Bentley but I'm
unclear on how to proceed. I can't tell whether I need to adjust the rear
retainer thing or the rods inside the door.
I could close the door with  one hand on my old Bus, so I know it can work
better.
Anyone fixed this that has any tips?

Thanks,
Doug
