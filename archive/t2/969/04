Subject: Double Cab Tranny noise...

I have a freshly built 091 in my 68 DC "Sgt Pepper". It shifts perfectly in
all gears running 85-90w GL4. All of the transmission, axles, shift rods,
baskets and bushings are new and lubed.

 

However, when the transmission gets warm it gets loud "backlash" noise
radiating from the tranny. It is really loud at highway speed deceleration
and 3rd gear deceleration.

 

Oddly, this is the same noise I had in my '70 DC and that transmission was
in perfect shape as well.

Is the noise common to Double Cabs because of the open space directly above
the transmission?

I talked to some racers and they said they have the same noise because they
don't run bushings, just metal-to-metal. I am using the factory mounting
system.

Any DC owners out there with similar noises?
