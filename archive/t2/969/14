Subject: 73 Bus locks

Hi,
 
I bought a 73 Bus there misses the key. following the seller information
all locks uses the same key. I would like manage this and it has two ways to
fix, I guess. find the key code and ask for a new one to VW or to replace all
inner locks to new ones. These are the more cheaper solution, isn't it? I am
open to all ideas to solve this in a less spent money way.
 
thanks in advance
for your help.
