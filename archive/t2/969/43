Actually, the CSV is easy. It's the injectors that are PITAs. ;-)

What we're looking for is fuel getting to the ingin. The CSV is a
first step test. If you've got a noid light you can see if the
injectors are getting a signal. (Or a multimeter, but that's a PITA
job too.)

You said the fuel pump is running, so we can step across the dual
relay for now. Just check either signals or visually verify fuel is
being squirted out. Both would be great. =D
