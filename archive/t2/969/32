Bob, your post really made my day!  It is so rare to get a compliment - as
you said, most people are far more prone to post a complaint than a
compliment. (It irks me to no end when someone posts a gripe to the list,
and when I check their history I discover that their previous 10 orders went
flawlessly ... no mention of any of those, but the eleventh one that wasn't
perfect went righto the list.. :-)  I'll definitely pass this on to the
folks at the shop, so they know their extra effort is appreciated.
