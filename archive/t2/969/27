many people complain when something doesn't go right, but I though I would
also pass out a few Super Atta Boys' to the guys at Bus Depot.   I was
putting in a new transmission and when I get the old one out I find that
the CV boots are in a lot worse shape than I thought, 3PM Monday a quick
phone call to the Bus Depot...paid for expidited service, was told I would
get em Wed....  well at noon Tue!!! they were sitting on my doorstep.

probably saved me a full day in the swap out, GREAT JOB GUYS!!!
