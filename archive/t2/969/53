this is a big key fact, the system itself works but it isn't getting fuel

if I am not mistaken they are normally on and trigger off to open??? would
have to look that up. but flicker should happen

highly unlikely

have you turned on the ignition (engine off) and pushed a pencil or
somesuch in there and moved the air vane and listen for the fuel pump to
come on??

not likely

so you know that the injector itself is not functioning.

why??

not getting the trigger signal is the major reason, you know that the plug
is not triggering the injector, so I would look there
