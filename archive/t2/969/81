Subject: Re: [T2] flexible Borescope?

When I was working for an aircraft rebuilder the company would on
occasion hire a contractor to come out and, using a borescope,
evaluate engines.  That fellow's borescope must have been pretty high
dollar; the image quality (on a 6 inch black and white screen) was
unbelievable.  Watching that guy at work ruined consumer level scopes
for me.
