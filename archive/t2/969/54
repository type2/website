With a dirth of machine shops equipped to do VW work in my area, I elected to
go the longblock route with the T1 motor in my panel.  I did some archive
research and went with a rebuilder that had some good reviews.  I asked for a
AS41 and got a AS21.  It has leaked from day 1, and thank God I had gauges, it
ran hot for the first 6 months, but finally broke in.  I really had to baby
it, and I wonder what it's lifespan will be though it seems to be running fine
now.

I plan on building my own motors whenever possible, and then I'll only have
myself to blame.

Whoda guessed I'd have the chance to use the word 'dirth' today?  JT Beaufort,
