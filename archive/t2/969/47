Subject: two vacuum nipples(heehee) on throttle body

on my 75 automatic i am currently running a dizzy for a 76 which has
only the vacuum advance on it.  should i plug the vacuum nipple(what's
the other word for this. i forget) on the bumper side of the throttle
body?  would not plugging this affect power or acceleration?

thanks,

jeremiah
