Subject: Re: [T2] First Bus / Rebuild or Buy Longblock ?

Hi Roger,

First off, what year is your bus??   If it has a 1600 in it, I would  
suspect it's  a 68-71 model; though the 1600's  were offered in 72-79  
buses in europe and Australia.

If your bus is a 68-71, you don't have the right hardware to install  
a 2L. Your cooling system, exhaust, alternator and engine mounts are  
completely different from what is needed for a 2L engine.  You would  
be much better off rebuilding your existing engine into a 1776cc   
configuration instead.

The one advantage to building your own is that you know precisely  
what's inside. The downside is that there's no-one else to blame if  
something goes wrong.


Happy Trails,

The previous owner let his 17yr old son drive the bus while the son's

heads $400, gaskets/bearings $100, cylinder & pistons $300, $300 cam,
machine work etc.   I am new to this world of air-cooled, rebuilt a lot
of Jeeps and GM.  It seems to me that from a cost standpoint, due to the
damage, that a long block is pretty close to the cost of me buying the
parts and having the machine work done and putting it together myself.
Not to mention buying a long block for $1600 incl. shipping gives me the
chance to upgrade to the 2000.

Am I correct in this dilemma?  Anyone else run the numbers and come up
with this?  Am I missing something?
