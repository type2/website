Subject: First Bus / Rebuild or Buy Longblock ?

The previous owner let his 17yr old son drive the bus while the son's
car was in the shop!  The #3 exhaust valve broke off hit the piston
turned sideways and jammed its way into the head.  I am looking at new
heads $400, gaskets/bearings $100, cylinder & pistons $300, $300 cam,
machine work etc.   I am new to this world of air-cooled, rebuilt a lot
of Jeeps and GM.  It seems to me that from a cost standpoint, due to the
damage, that a long block is pretty close to the cost of me buying the
parts and having the machine work done and putting it together myself.
Not to mention buying a long block for $1600 incl. shipping gives me the
chance to upgrade to the 2000. 
 
Am I correct in this dilemma?  Anyone else run the numbers and come up
with this?  Am I missing something?
 
Due to my recent entry into this world, I would like to buy the long
block through Bus Depot it seems that they are very reputable and would
have chosen wisely when picking a supplier.
