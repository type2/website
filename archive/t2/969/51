	I'm not familiar with this motor; I take it to be FI.   If I 
understand your sketchy description,  this zone of the air intake 
where you've found a disused vacuum takeoff nozzle, which we might 
call the start of the inlet manifold,  would be c.2" across.  This is 
a promising place to slap in a water jet.  Plug the open nozzle by a 
bung, grommet, or whatever will close it off from the atmosphere, but 
with a big (transfusion donor) needle glued in to put the point near 
the middle of the airflow.
	For all youse mystical carb fans, the corresponding place 
just inside the throttle butterfly, at the start of the inlet 
manifold before it branches,  has much more suction so you need a 
small bore needle c.0.51mm ID to restrict water flow enough.
