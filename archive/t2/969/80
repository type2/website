Check that the white wire from the harness is on the negative side of the
coil. That is the wire that triggers the injectors. Had me stumped for a
while until Busaholic reminded me.

She will start if I spray fluid in there, but then dies..

I DO get the flickering light when I use a test light on the #1 pin on the
ECU
plug from the coil.

I DO NOT get a flicker when I test at the injector end of the harness.
The injectors have juice all the time when the key is on.

So why will the injectors not fire????
