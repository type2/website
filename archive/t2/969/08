Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel smell and replacing rubber filler neck

I have this same problem when the fuel gauge is past 3/4 full.  I never
noticed if it's a left hand turn, though.  I actually have had fuel drip out
on the ground.  Not too safe.

Which part on the microfiche is it that is ripped from the nozzle?
