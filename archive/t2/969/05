Call it the nose so we know what is being discussed. =D

Personally, I think it would be rewarding as heck to do it yourself.

There are two panels available at bus depot. Which one you need
depends on the damage to your nose. Nice thing about the full nose is
it has the windshield sill that is usually rusted out:

Middle section between the headlights:

Used panels may be available from the used vendors, or you could take
a sawsall to the junkyard when a late bus appears and cut it yourself.
Shipping is expensive, because of the size and fragility of the
panels. (Remember to cut WAY bigger than the damage you're repairing.
You can trim once it's home.)

Eastwood has a good selection of tools. Even if you buy them cheaper
elsewhere, the info is invaluable. For example, a flanger will be your
best friend since you don't have welding experience:

There are occasional discussions here and on other forums about using
panel adhesives instead of welding. That may be something to look
into.

Do some googling on body repairs too. Lots of good info out there.
Specific questions can be brought here. Also, type2.com has an archive
function to dig through.
