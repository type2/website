NBD

If the engine was brand new and  never had any oil in it--then I'd be
worried.

But I'll bet it's had oil in it before and it wasn't dry.

Why she mentioned it was hard starting I have no idea--because it should
have been.
There was still oil in the bearings & rings.

I'd would have liked to see you doing the arm wave mambo runing towards
the Bus--that would have been plenty funny--
