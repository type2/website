First, if there is any rust AT ALL, you'll want to clean the rust as best a
you can, Spray Phosphoric Acid on the remaining rust, let it sit for a
couple of hours, rinse it with clear water, dry and apply some sort of rust
preventative, POR15, Rust Bullet, etc.. As for the mold, straight or diluted
bleach should work. Spray adhesive such as 3M will hold the plastic in
place.

You are on your own about making a new door panel unless you want to use
really thin masonite or the plastic sheeting that is used in bathtub
surround from Lowe's or Home Depot.

BTW... If you are a veteran and have a VA hospital ID or a DD-214, you can
get this stuff at Lowe's or Home Depot 10% off.

Subject: [T2] door panels

On the mission to clean my stiffening door locks I came across rain water
that had been hiding inside the drivers door and had made mush of my door
panel at the bottom.

The good news - the locks work great now.
The bad news - Start of rust (caught early thankfully) inside the door and
the panels at the dog leg riddled with mould.[Bob Pratt] ...
