Subject: Re: [T2] FI Fuel Leak - and Ice?

you pretty well answered your first question,,,
if you didn't have that filter,, the crap in it would have been in your 
pump....
good idea to have one there..

as for ice.... leaking gas is COLD.. and will attract moiture in the air.. 
so at the right dewpoint,, that moisture will freeze.. the temps and 
humidity have to be aligned to allow this condition to happen...
here in southern Ontario... maybe a couple days a year... as it is usually 
too warm with the right humidity to ice... it just makes water droplet....
it is very similar to a cold beer in a bottle on a warm humid day,, will 
sweat.... make that a colder day.. and it will freeze..
