Subject: Fw: [T2] oil return ?

I do like Mark's suggestion of tapping a hole into the side of the 
generator/oiler filler stand. Oil is supposed to go in there.

As for the hole in the sump method, I don't believe that pressure 
would be a problem as the oil would be coming from the pressurized 
system. I do like the generator stand solution.

Cheers!
