      Ya just gotta get in the slow lane with the trucks and hang-in there, 
in third if possible, hoping for 45 mph, and knowing a downhill is usually 
not far off. I blew about four engines in a '68 bus learning this. Instead 
of a life being trapped behind one of these, you get to be the problem. It 
helps if you are getting really old, in no hurry. Cheers, Art, '82 Westy.
