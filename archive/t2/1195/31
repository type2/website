I know you deal in the weird, Rob - but saying "bypass filter" doesn't 
mean much to us in the normal VW world. ;)

Doesn't seem like it would really do much good if it only gets some random 
subset of oil, instead of a flow.  But to each their own...

My worry, if you were to tap the oil pressure port would be that you'd 
create a pressure drop (...a bypass!) in the rest of the oiling system. 
If you looped the OP port back to the sump, you'd create an easier passage 
to the sump...and so a prefered passage.

How would you keep most of the oil in the block?  Is the filter, or the 
exit or entrance orific, particularly small for example?

Actually it is - the type3 dipstick area.  Universal cases have it 
drilled, so you run a blockoff plate there, non universal cases have a 
flat spot there that could be drilled and tapped for studs.  (I don't know 
if there's enough meat there for a directly tapped return fitting).

Or I recall there's a port (with a plug, so pull the plug and tap for a 
fitting) on the -inlet- side of the oil pump, right in the same area. 
That's suction side, so basically the sump.  Take a look at the real pic 
for this (this part goes in that spot)

Now would I do this to my engine?  No way.  Way to much work for very 
little gain. I'd rather put the time and energy into a full flow filter.


Take a look at the oil routing diagrams that are out there:

Don't trust some random guy on TS?  Here's Bob's:

If you were to short circuit the OP sender to the sump (without a massive 
restriction), you'd bypass the entire rest of the system, leading to a 
dead motor fast.  Unless you run on magic. ;-)


And for fun, a cutaway view of part of the system:

If you still insist on a bypass, bypass at the oil cooler.  There are 
remote cooler flanges that will replace the cooler (btw - oil cooler is 
what you're searching for, not oil radiator. ;) - and maybe some that with 
work could probably still run the cooler.   This channel is the approprate 
place to pick up bypass oil - the case is engineered with this bypass in 
mind out of the box, and still supplies the right amount of oil to the 
engine.  (you may notice that the oil cooler doesn't get full flow - so 
anyone who "full flow filters" using one of those cooler mounts is fool 
flowing themselves..)


Here's a few pics of the typical full flow methods:

Good luck.  Whatever you end up doing, get some pics up somewhere and show 
us. ;-)
