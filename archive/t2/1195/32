Subject: Re: [T2] oil return ?

I'm with David. I don't believe that using the OP port to bleed off a 
small amount of oil is a good idea. If you do go that route, install a 
dial pressure gage to check your actual oil pressure before installing 
the filter. Then, using an orifice or needle valve, you may "tune" the 
bleed so as not to reduce the oil pressure significantly. 
Incidentally, the oil pump on a good engine should have plenty of 
additional volume available to supply a small "leak" as you are 
describing. The other side of the filter should drain back to the 
sump. You can easily use the type 3 dipstick area to create a return 
port. I just used this area to install a fluid temperature sensor for 
my fuel injection system. Facing the pulley end of the engine this is 
located to the lower right hand of the pulley, facing to the rearward 
end of your automobile.

Cheers!
