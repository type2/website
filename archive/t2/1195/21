Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel Skins Steering Wheel Wrap

where did you find a skin big enough to fit a bus wheel?
ah,, when you say wrap, it is a 3" strip that you twist around and around..?
I have one of them on my Camper, and I love it too!
But I have looked for the molded style,  but they are usually for a smaller 
dia wheel
I recently saw where someone had cut the molded one and made it fit.. looked 
well done too!
and it is thicker than the "wrap" style.
