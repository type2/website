Subject: Re: [T2] FI Fuel Leak - and Ice?

Yes,, a filter for the EFi pump must flow enough ,,, not enough flow will 
speed up the liquid, and liquid moving at a fast pace will displace its 
latent heat.. and freeze...
put a large filter in place, and the flow goes down, allowing less temp 
change,,
it is suprising that filter doesn't collapse from atm pressure,, but they 
are pretty tough plastic and have a strong round design..

you need more effective filter area,, and larger in out ports than a carb 
engine filter...
