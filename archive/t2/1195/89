The FI system I have is from

http://www.redlineweber.com/html/Fuel_Injection/Fuel_Injection_Table_of%20_Contents1.htm

I have only driven it ~3,000 miles so it is hard to talk about
reliability.  So far, it has worked well on a non-stock engine (Type1
1915cc).  Even when not running well it has managed to soldier on (like
when the distributor cap and rotor had light surface rust).  I'm still
chasing down gremlins that are probably more related to poor installation
and a lack of focus on my end.  The engine is smooth, powerful, and
thirsty.  Hopefully I can finally get that last point sorted out this
spring.
