Subject: Vanagon AC Westy vs Bay Westy

This is a discussion that never ends.
Keep both of them as light as possible and you BOTH will be happy. My favorite
was the 71 Westy with a dual port 1600. Have a 85 Westy with 2.2 Suby and am
quite pleased. All the air cooled units work great if you slow down and keep
them light. They were designed for it. Even to the point of waiting until you
get to the campground to fill the water tank. This does not mean driving 50
Mph. Get a cyl head temp gauge and watch it. Look out the window, VW gave us a
great view?
