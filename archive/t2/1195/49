Subject: door panels

On the mission to clean my stiffening door locks I came across rain water
that had been hiding inside the drivers door and had made mush of my door
panel at the bottom.

The good news - the locks work great now.
The bad news - Start of rust (caught early thankfully) inside the door and
the panels at the dog leg riddled with mould.

The plastic sheet had been cut to allow speakers and I suspect this let
more moisture to get to the cardboard.

I'm wondering if anyone has anyone suggestions for these three problems
- to better allow any rain to drain (dogleg weep door holes are there and
unclogged),
- for what particular glue / method to reattach the plastic
- any experience with re fabricating the cardboard door panel or with these
busdepot panels? http://www.busdepot.com/p002

Many thanks,

Steve
