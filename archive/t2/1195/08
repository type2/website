Subject: Re: [T2] 70 bus ..


  I have always wanted to write a book talking about those type of
fixes...

Like the one off road race, where it was strange to see the wife arrive 
"driving" the 'motorhome', and Mario, the driver, in the race car... coming 
into the track .... ah.. the 'motorhome' was a '70 bus,, the race car was a 
flat towed Baja Beetle.. you know,, on a tow bar..

no one thought toooo much until after the races.. standing around enjoying a 
pop,, and Mario started to pull the engine out of the Motorhome, and the 
beetle,, and swap them!  ...
He had blown the Motorhome engine on the way to the race,, so he started the 
towed beetle, and pushed his wife 20 miles to the track!
