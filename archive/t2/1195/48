It comes with a charge controller and a bunch of 10 gauge wire.  Looks 
to be a great deal, but will it fit on the roof of a bus?  It's 9.5 feet 
long, and you can't cut it!  Too long for my high roof, but maybe some 
of you fixed-roof guys without sunroofs could put it on top?  Or maybe 
you could just keep it rolled up and unroll it when you get to the 
camping site?  Personally I avoid anything that adds to my setup or 
takedown time when camping, but it is tempting at that price.

Martin, with all due respect a 2w or even 5w panel isn't doing much of 
anything to keep your battery charged while camping.  You can get 40 
watt panels on that auction site for $79 with free shipping!  I bought 
one a couple of years ago for $120 and thought I was getting a good 
deal!  Sheez...
