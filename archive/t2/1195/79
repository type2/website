Subject: FI Fuel Leak - and Ice?

For starters, I have a 1968 with a 1915cc engine using an aftermarket
Redline/Weber F.I. system.  I have a late model (~1976) gas tank with two
fuel lines (feed and return).

Yesterday I was treated to gas dripping onto the driveway. One of the fuel
lines was leaking under the tank.  It looks like it is the return line, but
the weird part is that there was

1.  A fuel filter on this line
2.  Ice/slush covering the fuel filter and the connection between the
filter and the fuel line heading towards the tank

Now, I will admit that it is possible I have mis-traced the fuel lines and
this is really the line heading to the fuel pump.

So, I have 2 questions.

1.  Is there a good reason to run a fuel filter before the fuel pump?  Yes,
I have one after the fuel pump.
2.  What would cause ice build-up on the fuel filter?

It has been cold (below freezing) the past few days, but the bus hasn't
been driven in a week and there was no other signs of this icy mixture
anywhere else.

A bit more context - the guy who installed the engine was incompetent, but
it has been running relatively well for 18 months.  Also, the filter has a
lot of crap in it.

TIA.
