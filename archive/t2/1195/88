Subject: Delete from your address book

As most of you already know, my husband, Larry, passed away October 30,2012.
Due to his past involvement with many groups and individuals,he is receiving
many emails and i just can't seem to keep up. I have other things attached to
this email address so i need to leave it up for a while longer.
 what i am asking of you all is to PLEASE delete Larry from your address book
so that we don't continue getting hundreds of emails each week, which we just
end up deleting.
Thank you so much for helping us with this matter.

If you need to get a hold of me directly, please use my address:

God Bless, Paula and family
