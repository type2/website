Subject: Re: [T2] door panels

I re-glued my vapor barrier after replacing the window regulator.  I am at
work now but can look for the tube when I get home.  I just picked it up at a
hardware store and looked for something weather proof, plastic friendly, and
versatile.  For the speakers, get some sheet plastic (I even used cut up
garbage bags) and glue the to the vapor barrier above the speakers and tuck
the plastic around them and into the door hollow.  This will create a little
roof over the speakers and drain the water back to the door instead of near
the cardboard panel.  Then glue the vapor barrier back to the doorframe.  You

On the mission to clean my stiffening door
locks I came across rain water
that had been hiding inside the drivers door
and had made mush of my door
panel at the bottom.

The good news - the locks
work great now.
The bad news - Start of rust (caught early thankfully) inside
the door and
the panels at the dog leg riddled with mould.

The plastic sheet
had been cut to allow speakers and I suspect this let
more moisture to get to
the cardboard.

I'm wondering if anyone has anyone suggestions for these three
problems
- to better allow any rain to drain (dogleg weep door holes are there
and
unclogged),
- for what particular glue / method to reattach the plastic
-
any experience with re fabricating the cardboard door panel or with these
busdepot panels? http://www.busdepot.com/p002
