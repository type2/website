yeah, same here.  pulled it out of the crap by rejetting a hell of a lot 
leaner than the 10 across the board, but only picked up 2mpg, 3 on a good 
tank. (so 11-12 to 15-17).

actually running too lean on progression right now so it bogs a bit on the 
shift (and you can watch it lean out too far), but may still be able to 
lean out WOT another half point or so - but..

otoh, the lm2 helped me rejet it which REALLY put the life back into the 
old block.  seriously woke it up.  just wish I could net another 3-5 
mpg....
