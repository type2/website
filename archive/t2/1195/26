Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel Skins Steering Wheel Wrap

Mine came from Wheel Skins like Jason mentioned. I got it as a gift so I am
not sure who it was purchased from. However, you do stitch it by hand and
that takes a long time. They estimate an hour in their instructions but it
took me about four hours.

The time is worth it though as it is a fantastic fit and a pleasure. It is
100% leather and has some serious thread that arrives in the box. A needle
is included as well.
