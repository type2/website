Subject: Wheel Skins Steering Wheel Wrap

I received a black wheel skin wrap for KK-Louise's, my '71 bus, steering
wheel. It took several hours to install but the end result has been
fantastic. I drive when it is 28 degrees outside and I no longer need
gloves to hold the steering wheel. I still need gloves because I drive a
bus but that is beside the point. :)

My hands have a little more grip as well when making slow turns and you
need some extra muscle. I am expecting it to hold up well but it is
certainly one of my favorite interior upgrades I have made.

If anyone is on the fence, I give it a vote of approval, for whatever that
is worth.

Cheers and happy bussing,

Max
