Most cars have speedometers that read slightly high (as mentioned below,
reads faster than actual speed).  German ones in particular.  I think there
is a liability issue for inaccuracy in the other direction, and there is a
need to compensate for things such as variance in tire diameter.

At highway speeds the GPS is pretty accurate.  The speedometer from my 1968
reads spot on with the GPS at 60.
