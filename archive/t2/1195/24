Subject: Re: Wheel Skins Steering Wheel Wrap

Many years ago I bought a handmade leather steering wheel cover from Ken at
thebusco.com it covered the wheel then you had to use the thread given to sew
it through the holes. It's great, but I have no clue if he still can get
these.  It's probably been 10 yrs since I bought it. I can send photos if
anyone is interested.
