I figure I'll mention here for posterity (not that anyone cares) that these
studs gall for 2 reasons.  First is that the factory nuts for many years
production are stainless wire insert lockers, and even a well intentioned
person can have them gall on removal.  Often/usually they will come out of the
pump body instead of the nut coming off the stud.  Next, I truely think (but
wouldn't go through the effort of buying a metric wire set to measure) that
some years at least these may be a near interference class fit on the studs. 
They are very high quality rolled thread studs, and considering a new standard
class non locking M6 nut is a very snug fit on the studs, I'd guess they may
be slight oversize.  That is mere conjecture, but sure seems true, and would
make sense in the pre loctite world for the end sunk into the housing if you
didn't want it to come out as the aluminum expands faster than the steel.
 
Anyway they are often messed up when you try to get the locker off the stud,
and if you use non lockers one should loctite these on reassembly.

I have 2
lengths from what appear to be otherwise stock pumps - 37.5mm, and 41.75mm.
The shorter work likely better for the rebuilds with the aftermarket cams.
They appear to be M6 to me; good to have it confirmed. If you come across one
great, but please don't put yourself out. Mike
