Subject: Some 'help' with something..

Recently, a friend of mine gave me 2 complete "driving light fixtures' from an
'expensive' donor..they are very powerful lighting units, and have approx..6
inch 'nacelle'..that when installed, makes the front glass  flush..if you have
a hole of that dimension..to put them in..so.. I was thinking..since I have
made sooooo many 'mods' to my '74 Westy..I would cut 2 holes big enough for
their facia, into the front 'face' of my bus..a little bit below and closer to
the front mount spare, than the stock headlights.  Yes I know this is 'anti VW
Bus'..'logic'..but..the increased  'power' would be great up here in Canada to
see 'critters' or "politicians'..on the road..and it beats mounting on the
front bumper..'SMASH'..or above the cab.."Total white light blind"!
Comments?
Cheers
Syd
