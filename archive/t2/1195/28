Well Robert,, if you want to filter the oil,, you will need to put it in 
series with the oil flow..  by connecting to the Oil P warning light port,, 
some of the oil will pass out of the block, and thru the filter,, but MOST 
of the oil will just stay in the passageways in the block,,

so.. most if not all the filter set ups I have seen take the oil out of the 
pump cover, and put it back into the block by tapping, and drilling the 
galley on the pump outlet path... AND you must plug the pump outlet to 
ensure the oil flows thru the filter, and not thru the block galley.

Also,, one thing to keep in mind,,, if you restrict the flow thru a small 
oil fitting,, smaller than 10mm.. then there will be a pressure drop at that 
restriction... using the oil-p port will have a significant pressure drop to 
FLOW of oil... for its intended purpose, there is no flow, so there is no 
pressure drop,, making it perfect for a switch,, but very poor for a outlet 
for flow.

imho, the fittings for the external oil passages must be at least 10mm I.D. 
.. if you go to your local hardware store and see the hose fitting you want 
to use.... check out the ID... and see if it is 10mm,, or can be drilled out 
to be 10mm,,   from there you can find a hole in the block to accomadate 
that fitting.

Hope that helps
Jamie
