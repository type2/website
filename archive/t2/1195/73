	The lure of 'poor man's power steering', esp when a wife with 
limited upper-body strength is to be encouraged to drive the camper 
in town, is powerful.  Lighter steering, esp at low speeds, tempts me 
toward  rogue front pressures 35 - 40 psi.
	Grip in fast cornering does suffer.  And watch for the 
expected faster wear in mid-tread; how severe will it be?
	Rotation of tyres each several thousand mi will minimise the 
uneven wear resulting.

	I know we have hevi-doodi theorists who can lay down dogmatic 
theory in response to such unusual ideas.  But has anyone actual 
experience with front 185R14c at 40 psi?
