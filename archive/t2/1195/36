I think (but won't swear) as I know what a "bypass filter" means that your
best place Rob is into the sump.  That is my thought at least.  David's
suggestions to sump location are fine, or anywhere really.  Nothing wrong with
bypass setups, they were factory on everything in the 50's-60's, including the
Porsche 356 version of our lowly little air cooled 4's.  Do they filter all of
the oil, all of the time?  No.  But will all of the oil eventually get
filtered, yes.
 
I would caution standard issue that unless you have "sand
sealed" the case (even with one of the "bolt on" versions) you are probably
deluding yourself as to how much utility, again eventually all gets filtered,
just not all the time but it will be a dowhill battle vs an unsealed case.
 
I
have a NOS size 4 Fram bypass filter cannister and several filters with its
instructions somewhere in the basement that I bought for Dolan's '67 when I
was going to build his original motor (the size 3 I think was what Porsche
used factory) and if I can locate it I'll see where they say, but I'm guessing
it will say dump to the sump.  And you defintely want to suck from a
restricted source so as not to remove too much flow (and thereby in worse case
pressure) from the mains.  David's concern is very valid, you might want to
run a just ever so slightly higher flow pump with the bypass filter, but even
a stocker with everything tight and a restricted supply will be sufficient.
 
I would question utility of all this a bit compared to a standard full flow
setup.  For Dolan's the only reasons I was going to do it was:
 
1: the bright
orange cannister looked real damn cool, very Porsche, very period correct and
vintage.
2: it added a great deal of oil volume, never a bad thing.
3: some
filtration better than none for VW thinking a 20-30 mesh screen was
"filtration."
 
If you aren't caring about looks, not a lot of reason really
not to go with a cheap full flow setup.

I know you deal in the weird, Rob -
but saying "bypass filter" doesn't mean much to us in the normal VW world. ;)
Doesn't seem like it would really do much good if it only gets some random
subset of oil, instead of a flow.  But to each their own...

My worry, if you
were to tap the oil pressure port would be that you'd create a pressure drop
(...a bypass!) in the rest of the oiling system. If you looped the OP port
back to the sump, you'd create an easier passage to the sump...and so a
prefered passage.

How would you keep
most of the oil in the block?  Is the filter, or the exit or entrance orific,
particularly small for example?

Actually it is - the type3 dipstick area. 
Universal cases have it drilled, so you run a blockoff plate there, non
universal cases have a flat spot there that could be drilled and tapped for
studs.  (I don't know if there's enough meat there for a directly tapped
return fitting).
