You are on your own about making a new door panel unless you want to use
really thin masonite or the plastic sheeting that is used in bathtub
surround from Lowe's or Home Depot.

BTW... If you are a veteran and have a VA hospital ID or a DD-214, you can
get this stuff at Lowe's or Home Depot 10% off.
