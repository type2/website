You can get that part # from a VW dealer for under $5.

Hi All, and Happy New Year.

I'm on the hunt for one or two Type IV oil pump o-rings, VW 021 115 133,
black rubber, 60.8x2mm. Looks like the usual folks (Bus Depot, German
Supply, Aircooled, Easterm Imports) don't have it outside of an engine
gasket kit - anyone have any ideas? Just occurred to me that the early
aircooled vanagons might be the same pump..
