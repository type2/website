Thanks, Jamie.

The filter on the low pressure side is the same filter I used when I had a
normal carb'd engine.  I guess I was concerned that it might have trouble
keeping up with the draw of the FI fuel pump, given the much higher
pressure the FI fuel filter needs to deal with.

Oh, and now that I have the filter off, it didn't have nearly as much
debris as I initially thought.
