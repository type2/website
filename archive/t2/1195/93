Hi Mark,
Nah, probably bone stock Bay.  I just got used to everything being faster,
especially uphill. 1983 Westy (A/C). I don't try to keep up, just be happy
that it is still going and will get there.    CHT is good to have.  Only way
to "keep up" is to get a later wedge that already has all the plumbing, and
put in a subaru.  Not worth doing on an A/C model IMHO, and I have thought
long and hard about it.  jon

snip>Yesterday I was going up grade, not too bad, but floored and losing 
speed, when an older baywindow with (I presume) an upright engine blew 
past me.
