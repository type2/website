Subject: Re: [T2] Wheel Skins Steering Wheel Wrap

Years ago I got a nice cover from www.wheelskins.com.  High quality, and
the fit is great.  These are not the twist around style, but actually are
stitched together on the inner diameter of the wheel so the fit is great.
 All you need to do is measure the wheel for your requirements, and enjoy.
