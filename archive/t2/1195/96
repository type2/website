Meh.  The aircooled vanagons are really underpowered with a stock motor, 
especially westies, IME.

but - there's a lot to be said for driving style, too.  The difference in 
hitting the bottom of a hill at 70 vs 65 vs 55 (examples, not what's right 
for your engine and gearing) can mean having the engine in it's strongest 
power band for the pull up the hill vs immediately not having enough oomph 
to pull the hill.  And powering down the hill to get up the next one can 
provide additional inertia to help.

knowing your bus - gearing, tire size, where the engine performs best - 
and using that knowledge to read the road and plan ahead - can be a huge 
help.

which isn't to say your drivetrain isn't down on power, or that the bay 
wasn't running a built 2 liter....or that he was driving a bus with no 
interior at all, much less a full late model westy kit.

or his tire/gear and entry speed combination just worked better for the 
hill. ;)



around here, (uh - it's florida, so..) a 4mph (200 rpm!) difference can 
mean pulling to the top of the hill and not losing any speed vs losing 10mph by 
the time I get to the top (in my big tire strong stock motor full camper 
'66).  Of course it's also a sad fact of life that at 65mph, I'll still 
blow the doors off the folks sleeping at the wheel in a 70mph speed 
zone...
