Subject: Re: [T2] FI Fuel Leak - and Ice?

Greg,
How is that FI working out for you?

I am in the process of installing an FI system on my 64 with a 1776cc 
engine. The kit supplier recommended that the fuel filter be installed 
upstream of the pump. Sounds like a good idea. The kit is a megasquirt 
adapted to a Mexican beetle intake and throttle body. Should be a very 
clean installation when I finish. This system also eliminates the 
dizzy.

I agree with Jamie. The ice is likely due to fuel evaperation cooling 
the filter and causing the condensation to freeze. It would take just 
the right conditions.
