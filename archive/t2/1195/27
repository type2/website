Subject: oil return ?

Greetings Volks
	       I'm about to slap onto my 1600dp a bypass oil filter, 
of the superb if little-known brand Fluidyne (made by friends of 
mine), formerly on my Renault 10.  It is to be mounted on the engine 
platform (as distinct from the body), so it doesn't have to be 
disconnected when the motor is dropped.
	A brass T at the oil-P warning light is the means of bringing 
the oil out of the engine, up the middle of the std dunny-paper roll 
which is packed on one end in a brass/chrome vertical blind drum, 
sprayed over the top of the roll and draining by gravity thru this 
vast area of cellulose to absorb water, acids, and black particles. 
I found this filter also served as a minor oil-cooler.
	BTW I recall bypass filters of this type in Pop Sc &'or Pop 
Mech ads c.1950.  Fluidyne mfd a definitive version as their 
bread-&-butter while developing wood gasifiers, their main 
accomplishment.

	Now, where to I slap that oil back into the engine?  (To my 
surprise, neither Filter nor Oil Radiator entries in the archives 
give any clue.)
	I assume listees' experience will have been mainly with oil 
radiators, which similarly need a re-entry point.

thanx for help which I know will be forthcoming from those who've 
done it on a T1 engine.
