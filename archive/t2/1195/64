Hi Volks,

Could those interested in attending the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout 
this weekend please p-mail to let me know if they'll be needing a 
campsite?

I need to get a headcount before I call the campground to make sure they 
have enough site plowed out for us.

TCWBC... What's that?  Glad you asked. Point your browser at 
http://www.pottsfamily.ca/TCWBC and all will be revealed.

Visitors are also welcome,

Happy Trails,
