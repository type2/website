Subject: Re: [T2] solar trickle chargers

You would need a solar regulator with that size panel (or any panel >10W) to
avoid frying the battery. I have a 2W solar panel charging my 2nd battery (as
well as it being charged when the engine is running) and I have used it for a
couple of days camping with moderate use of lights. That said, I'm planning to
pump up the volume to 5W and swap the 2W over to topping up the main battery.
I expect to pay ~$20 for the 5W panel.
