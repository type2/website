Subject: Re: [T2] oil return ?

that would work well,  the problem I see with the tapping the bottom  of 
the case is will the return have enough pressure to push into the oil in the  
sump? where if done up high there will be no problems . the ones I used to 
see I  think were from JC whipme   later  md
