	Not only that, but any leak that developed would drain oil 
out of the engine, whereas making a hole at/near the dipstick, or the 
intriguing 'hollow stud' idea which attracts me, will not run liquid 
oil by gravity clear out of the crankcase/sump in the event of some 
failure in the sealing around the new hole.

	Great brains think alike =-O

	On the basis of my previous experience, incl oil P readings 
throughout, on the Renault Sierra motor, I fully expect to get no 
significant drop in oil P; a considerable boost to the oddly tiny oil 
capacity of the T1 motor; worthwhile cooling by circulating the 
admittedly small bypass flow thru the Fluidyne dunny-paper filter; 
and less wear because purer oil.

	Will keep youse informed on this caper.

Over; out
