Subject: Type 4 dipstick markings

Wondering if someone might be able to measure their dipstick on a Type 4
engine.  Just getting mine running which has been sitting for over 7 years.
 Dipstick was sitting in a damp area and rusted.  I was able to clean it up
with a wire brush, but it was so pitted that I can't find the markings.

Thank you.
