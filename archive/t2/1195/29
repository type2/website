	No.  As mentioned, this is a *bypass *  filter.  All the oil 
does eventually pass thru it, during the period of running while it 
has passed around the engine many times.  Only a small fraction of 
the total flow is thru the bypass, but sufficient for the oil to be 
cleaned.

	On the Renault, and any 'normal' :-| engine, the return from 
the Fluidyne to the sump is created by drilling a hole in a side of 
the sump, well above the max oil level, and screwing in a conical 
hardened hollow screw (with soft washer) presenting to the outside a 
nozzle onto which is clamped the thick-walled rubber tube draining 
the pan onto which is threaded the blind can containing the 
dunny-paper roll.    Clear as mud ;-)?
	It is not apparent to me where to make that hole in the VW sump :-[.

	Bypass filters do not require a high flow.  All the oil goes 
thru them  -  soon enough.
