A denizen of the Deep South, probably listening to zydeco which may

	I'd be interested  -  can you help me to find it?

	Even if they were invented that early, that does not prove 
them useless.
	Water injection was invented a century ago  -  that does not 
prove it's useless.

	From what you say, I infer you are talking about some attempt 
at a *full-flow*  filter.  Such a device, if it got blocked, would 
cripple oil-flow to the engine.   A bypass filter is incapable of 
that, as it bleeds off only a tiny fraction of the flow in parallel, 
not series.

	The bypass concept is not so arcane.  Fluidyne's bypass 
filter has a good record.  Can we drop this non-argument please?

	I look fw to hearing from those who have found where to drain 
the oil back into the sump.  I could enlarge the dipstick hole  ...
