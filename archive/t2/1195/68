Trey,

I have been rolling Hankook RA08 on all my type 2 vehicles for many years
now. Pretty much you follow the original guidelines and pressures for
radial tires.

30 psi front
42 psi rear (unladen) 46 psi rear (with load)

On a Westy, I run 30 psi front, 46 psi rear year round

I also rotate my Hankooks every 2500 miles. Sounds like a lot, but they
roll smoother and wear evenly that way.
