go out and rent the car of her chosing, take that nice relaxing trip,
enjoy it, and when the credit card bill comes in mumble about how much
cheaper the bus would have been. (don't overdo it)

take her on some medium long day and weekend get aways, in the bus

eventually she will come to like it, or hate it, at which point you have
to decide which is more important.  I had always had buses but when my
late wife and I got married she let me know she did not like the 71 bus,
even though it took us thru Eastern Canada on our honeymoon with barely a
wisper. so got a VW 412 (kept it in the family anyway)  when she died I
guess I had a Bus as the only option when I got around to needing a new
vehicle.   got to know current wife when she was giving me a ride to work
while I rebuilt my engine so she kinda likes it, but won't drive it and
doesn't like to camp any which way so the bus makes no difference there.

but she's still worth keeping...
