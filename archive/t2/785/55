Subject: Re: [T2] Wife sez the bus isn't reliable enough to go to 

All right , all right ! I was just eager to give some advices, that's 
all  !!! not a big deal,  Don is surely the last one to need them 
(especially from me which learn mechanic 6 month ago).
Ok, I just did SF-Tahoe in about 4:30h  with my vanagon 83 (we left SF 
at 10pm - no traffic but a huge endless, painful  and engine killer 
slope for 50Mile before Tahoe )
its now 3:30, can't sleep (too much coka cola) ! so let's think about 
strong argument to persuade the wife.
1) being stuck in California is not that  bad if  something happens to 
the van, its a way to extend your vacation,  of course avoid being stuck 
in Death Valley.
2) you'll drive slowly for safety reason so she will be able to pickup 
flowers on the side of the road !
3) Let send to wife some recomandation letter from the type2 experts 
showing how expert and reliable you are fixing VW vans
4) offer flowers with the AAA card !
5) explain her that life is short anyway !!!!
6) try to minimize the danger, sort out and rank all the vanagon's 
danger ,  tell her that the fuel line is more likely to blow up the van  
before the steering wheel decide to go its own way !
7) don't tell her the truth !
8) tell her the truth but ease it by both drinking a bottle of Pino noir 
from Napa just before announcing her any potential problem with the van !

Ok enough for today
