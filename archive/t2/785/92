Subject: cylinder head Vol

My daughter and I measured the volume of each cylinder head to the 
machined portion.  The heads were leveled.  My daughter is a chemical 
engineer major so she should know how to measure volume, I hope!

1st head
a = 46.5 ml
b = 47.5 ml

2nd head
c = 46.5 ml
d = 49 ml

The heads were just machined but not CC at the machine shop.  These will 
be installed on a balanced 2.0 liter FI short block.  My question is, 
should I do anything about the difference in volume between the 
cylinders?  OR is that amount not significant? Please advise

thanks in advance!
