Subject: 71 Bus Tin?

I've got 2 sets of tinwork: the stock dual port doghouse rig, and a
set without the doghouse and small holes in the shrouds I assume are
for single port.

Anyway, quite a bit of this stuff is confusing. Since I didn't get to
take it apart, I am having difficulty figuring it out. There are
screws and holes in the fan shroud that I can't determine the use of.
etc etc etc

Is there a good n00b how-to on this stuff anywhere? Bentley isn't
helping me much, though I suppose with enough time I could figure it
out.
