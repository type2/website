Hi Everyone,
 
Just want'd to say that finding this LIST has been wonderfully insightful.
 
Thanks to all of you Type 2 owners & suppliers that share so much info on a daily basis w/ everyone especially newbies like myself.
 
Driving my Westi to its first Pottery Show over labor day weekend.  Im so excited.  I've only been thinking about this adventure for the last 2years.  Hopefully the brake job goes good this weekend & I dont find anything horrible!!!!   
 
Enjoy a Bus Ride & some Pottery today!
