Subject: Stalling engine

Hello, I have a 75 VW van. Recently I am having problem to get it idle. 
If I bypass the Air Flow meter by pulling out the plug, I have no 
problem to start and idle,as soon as I plug in the connector of the Air 
Flow meter ,the engine will stall.For this reason ,I check the 
resistance between terminals 7 & 8of the Air flow meter and it was 
bad,so I replace the Air Flow meter. But with the new Air flow meter, 
the problem was still there. I just can not have the engine idle. Can 
anyone please help.Thanks!


PS : I also install a new double rely.
