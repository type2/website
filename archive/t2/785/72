Subject: Does leaving ign on hurt Pertronics? (no start after draining

A safety check of Nyssa's 75 bus showed cracks in the tank to pressure 
regulator line, so knowing that she had a 1/4 tank, we drained it and 
replaced the gas line, along with new fuel filter.  We then played with 
the wiper housings, which I switched with "newer" ones that had less 
play.  I had her help me run the wipers to adjust their position, and no 
one noticed the ign was left on (to test them) until I had put the gas 
in and went to try to start the bus-at least 30 min later- she meanwhile 
had left with her Mom to go to a county fair.  No start, although I 
thought I heard a glimmer of catching only on the first 3 cranks.  I'll 
have them help me check for spark later (it is raining now) but gotta 
ask- while I know leaving the ign on can burn out points, is it any harm 
to the pertronics or coil?  How long does it usually take to prime a 
totally drained FI system?
