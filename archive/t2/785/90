Great site! Thanks!

Well, I started sorting things out. That site helped quite a lot.

It turns out I am missing a bunch of stuff. Though I do have the Hoover bit!
heh

Anyway, I'm missing the small piece that goes up under the crank
pulley, the duct for the oil cooler, and the fan itself (unless they
are interchangeable between doghouse and non-doghouse).

Also, is this right?

I have #18 and #'s 17 & 19. Are 17 & 19 supposed to be a two piece deal?
