This piece is important, and you have to install it before the pulley goes
on!

There is also a piece of tin that goes across the pulley on the rear (FIF)
side to prevent debris from falling into the bottom pulley tin.  This
piece is commonly discarded.

Also important, and must be used in conjunction with a front tin with the
proper hole.  This is a '71-only bus part.  If you can't get the proper
part you can improvise by adding sheet metal to a doghouse bug front tin.

It will fit, but a wider fan is better.  Measure yours to see which one
you have.  With all the mixing-and-matching that has gone on over the
years it isn't unusual to find a doghouse fan in a non-doghouse shroud.

Yep, to get at the thermostat.  I've also seen them in one piece.
