Subject: RE: [T2] Latest smog news :-(

Is it only CA that gets its smog equipment checked? I have never had an
exhaust analyzer touch any of my vehicles, old and new. I once saw one at a
local shop, but they don't use it... Is this an only in CA and maybe big city
thing? I am out in the country and they don't really care what is coming out
of the exhaust. The only thing we get in trouble for is flame throwers...
