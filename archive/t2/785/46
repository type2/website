Subject: Rear Shift Rod Coupler

I'm ready to install the transmission on Freebird (74 Kombi) but have 
discovered the rear shift rod coupler has been mangled by the PO.  I'll 
order a new one from bus Boys or someone but how difficult is it to 
install, after the transmission is in place?  Does it take a double 
jointed 3 armed orangutan to install once it's up there?
