How do we stay warm with heating costs so high? We just huddle around and burn our unpaid bills... <grin!> 

Just kidding!!!

Around here the HEAT PUMP is the key. Unfortunately our current house is gas and we saw a big increase in our heating bill last Feb-Summer. We moved into it in Feb. If it is expensive this winter we'll be pricing heat pumps... 

We're used to paying $120 total for heat and lighting... $15 for water. Per month. 

Will be heating my garage this winter to work on the bus too... Space heater. As long as it is 50+ degrees in the garage I can work happily though I still can't paint or glue without more heat. I have done a clutch job at 25 degree weather (mid-night outside winter) How do you heat your house, your bus, and your work space?
