Insist on having lug nuts HAND-TIGHTENED if getting tires or flats 
fixed.  Both busses in our family carry 3/4" Sliding handles with a 1/2" 
adaptor for the 19mm lug socket- make sure it is six-sided!   No Pipe 
extension needed (except rear axle nut)- My 114 lb daughter can get 
these loose as she stands on the end while gripping the gutter.
Re air compressor- very handy; the bigger the psiton, the faster it will 
fill.  I like the one from W_M that turns off at the stting you choose.
