This kind of info should be hided at any cost to any wife , it is scary !!

For a long trip , I would definitely take tools , fuel pump, coil , oil  
and  extra gas , portable battery/converter.
Alternator  could  easily be found and change everywhere (assuming you 
brought the tools kit with you).
I also create and print a PDF file of the Bentley manual , it contains 
all the pages which concern my van in case I need to fix it , 20 pages !!!

oh  !!! don't forget the sun screen blocker, you may have to spay many 
in you legs  if you spend  too much  time  under the van fixing  things  
! California  Sun is really strong ! ;-)))
