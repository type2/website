and sometimes better is not better,,,...for many of us who don't like the
latest and greatest, or have slow connections, or maybe accessing from a
PDA or cell phone.  fancy is not easier to use.  there really needs to be
a basic button.  for text only and fast downloading...

not to mention it would not pass the W3C/WAI test because the site doesn't
degrade smoothly, heck it doesn't hardly degrade at all.  I find myself
using the site less and less the more complex the site is made. takes
forever to load and half the time I can't input what I need.

now I know that Ron is not a programmer but everyone needs to understand
that not everyone likes, wants, or even can use all the bells and
whistles.  just the facts that's all I want.  don't need pretty, heck in
LYNX (browser) it is black and white anyway.

so 99% of the time I make a long distance phone call to waste Ron's
employee's time answering my questions and getting the right part.  but at
least I get the part and I get it fast.  just as long as Ron remembers
that his business is selling top line VW parts at fair prices I don't care
what else he does...
