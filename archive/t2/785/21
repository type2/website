Heck, it's not just red light cameras. There seems to be cameras all over the place on Sac area freeways. Ostensibly they allow monitoring of traffic conditions, but you gotta wonder what else they're looking at/for.
 
I think the jackbooted goons know better than to leave one of those monitoring rigs unattended. On the flip side of the prankster aspect, couldn't one usea fan or blower to chase any fumes away from the sniffer. Imagine getting a letter congratulating you for your "zero emission" bus :-)

The problem is, they've got their foot in the door with red light cameras.
Once we allowed one computer to be judge, jury and executioner over us, we
OK'd them all.
How long before we have to go to high exhausts and license plate flippers
to avoid the sensors?
 
OTOH, I can see some prankster sitting at the unattended sniffer site
with a mister bottle of gasoline, puffing a spritz of gas into the sensor
beam every time a SUV lumbers past...
