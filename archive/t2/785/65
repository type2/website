Hello, dear friends! I'm unwired and transmitting! Live from the blazing parking lot at the Eureka Springs show. Some of the Buskatiers are here, Amy & Alex from St. Louis, Eric and a couple of other dudes from Albuquerque, and Greg (?), he of the rolled splittie. Having a wonderful time, but it's hot as hell! More later...
