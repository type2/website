Unfortunately, the current Oregon governor is planning to veto the
recently passed emissions legislation so he can pass
Califonia-duplicate legislation here. I guess he subscribes to the Maj.
Burns (M*A*S*H reference) philosophy of "independent thinking is fine
as long as we all do it together". Apparently, there's some kind of
push to get the CA law into Washington as well. There goes the

I'm parting out / selling the original '72 westy interior, now that the
'78 is in. Anyone interested in hardware, or the z-bed or whatever,
lemme know. Some of it is listed on theSamba, but I'll discount / take
a BO from a listee. least I can do for the advice you've all provided
over the last few years.
