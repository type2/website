Hi Jerry,

Your install isn't upside-down, but I think it is off by 90 degrees.   
It looks to me like yours is screwed into the front of the dash, with  
the gauge facing upwards.  The last install I saw done with that  
gauge bezel had the bezel screwed to the underside of the dash,  
facing the gauge 90 degrees to the rest of the gauges. That way the  
wiring faces the front of the bus, and isn't as obvious as it's  
hidden under the dash. It's probably easier to read the way you have  
it installed, but not as pretty to look at.

For the first 2 years I had my VDO gauge it was located in the clock  
pod to the right of the speedo. It isn't hard to fabricate an adapter  
if you don't already have a clock there.


Happy trails,
