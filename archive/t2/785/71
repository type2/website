Subject: Re: letting the "monkeys" at your bus

Last March we went camping using the daughter's 75 from Savannah to the 
Fla Keys.  I sat in the back a lot, and felt a vibration  which I 
assumed was bad balancing, as cv's were new.   I asked her to go to 
Goodyear after spring break (they were Wrangler tires) and have the 
balancing checked.  She emailed me that they found a bent rim (she had 
driven over a curb) and switched it for the spare.  In May I helped her 
pack up her dorm and still noticed some vibration, so at a rest area I 
popped the hubcap to see if the lug nuts were tight and found ONLY 4 
WERE ON!  Luckily we had spares and the problem was solved........Can't 
believe the fools likely lost it (it was not in the hubcap well) and 
just figger'ed 4 were enough?
