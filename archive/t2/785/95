Subject: A tick-e-ty clatter and two word diagnosis - '76 USA Westy

I visited my mechanic yesterday and explained that the '76 Safare 
(mechanical lifters) started making a really sharp clattering [from the 
engine comartment].  It went   tick-e-ty...  tick-e-ty  ...  tick-e-ty... in 
a very fast and frightening manner.  It started all of a sudden at 40-50 
mph, and continued all the way home....   2 miles

I did notice a drop in power on the small hills, and there is no oil puddle 
evident.


My mechanic gave me a two word diagnosis and I am off to take a peek and see 
if he was right.  Oh, also, he said that I could fix it by myself.

Anyone care to take a guess??  Two words.......
