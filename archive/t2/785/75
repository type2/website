A quick check to see if you have spark is some starting fluid.  Or you 
can pull off a plug wire and test that way as well.

The system should prime pretty quickly.  That pump outputs LOTS of fuel. 
  You might want to try deflecting the AFM flap with the ignition on to 
make sure you hear fuel flowing.
