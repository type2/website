Yes, I should have been more specific in my last post. Actually, ALL search
boxes on BusDepot.com will accept either keywords or part numbers.

The search boxes on the main (white) page can search either keywords OR part
numbers, and display only those results that fit your year (or even a
specific part category if you have drilled down that far):

The search box on the yellow left menu bar, by comparison, is a site-wide
parts search - it searches the entire BusDepot parts database, regardless of
vehicle application. This means it can find part numbers that exist in the
database but do not yet have vehicle application data (which may fit your
year, even though we don't have them keyed in as such yet; there are many of
these, with 190k parts to sift through).  On the other hand, it will also
display parts that don't fit your year at all.  While it is labeled as a
part number search, in fact it too will also search keywords.
