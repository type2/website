Subject: Got the fuel pump to work, now what?

Hey all!

I got the pump thing figured out.  I was finally able
to start the bus this afternoon.  The problem now is
that it runs very poorly.  In fixing the pump I had to
remove the distributor.  Now I reinstalled it and
timed the engine to 5 degrees ATDC.  It doesn't idle
well and I can tell that not all the gas is being
combusted.  I did everything in accord to the Muir
handbook, what could I be missing?

Thanks for any help.  If I can get it running good
again I will see some of you down at BNNTA.
