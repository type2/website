Where did you see those numbers, inside the door?  Do they say 
GVWR?  That's GROSS weight, which is the maximum permissable fully-loaded 
weight of your bus.  Net weight (curb weight) is not written anywhere that 
I know of, but you can easily determine it by going to a truck stop and 
weighing your bus.

My bus, which is a '73 highroof with full camper interior, fridge, stove, 
THREE batteries, floor jack and a 60lb toolbox, spare parts and my 180lb 
butt in it weighed only 4100 lbs.  I weighed it several times so I am 
fairly certain my numbers are accurate.

>But the van weighs 4961lbs - where did you get 3200lbs ????
>My mustang weighed 3600lbs . The back of the van weighs 2800lbs alone .
>3200lbs ah NO .

Ah YES.  Tell you what, go weigh your bus and if it is higher than 4,000lbs 
with no occupants, fax me a copy and I will pay for the weighing (up to 
$10, should be about $7 though).  Fair enough?
