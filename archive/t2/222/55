Oh, I see, we're both right.

I use my static test light in parallel ;) off the coil connection with the
green wire to ground.  That way I don't have to change any other
connections.

Seems theres more than one way to skin a cat!

With the light in series it goes off. Pull green wire between
distributor and coil.  Add indicating device (light, meter)in series,
turn on ignition.  With points open, there is no ground, hence no
current flow. Points closed, there is a ground path through the points,
hence light goes on.

Try it. Now, I could be wrong...  But that's the way it's worked for the
forty years or so that I've been static timing engines to get them
started.  If you're installing the current indicating device at some
other point in the circuit, all bets are off.


  12v ----- Coil ----- light/meter ----- distributor/points ----- ground
                                      points open = no ground
                                      points closed = ground

You could accomplish the same thing just using an ohmmeter, but you have
to take the condenser out of the circuit.
