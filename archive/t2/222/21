The old engine is going back to the rebuilder, but I doubt I will get my
core deposit back.

The Type IV engine cases are very durable and can be welded multiple
times to repair the rod through the case scene or welded and retapped for
oil drain plugs etc. You see most of the heavy repairs amoung Dune Buggy
Enthusiast that crank the Type IVs over 5000 Rpms. Heads are the most
often rejected rebuild part.
If you need new heads Try Gordon Johnson & Sons Machine Shop for your
cylinder heads.
New AMC's for little more than rebuilts. #910180 2-liter Air Cooled
Vanagon heads
800-360-1415
I also have two pair of used heads if that is an option for you.
