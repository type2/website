Subject: Possible fuel injector problem??

Hi all,
Let me just try to state the facts simply:
75 westy w/1800 FI T4 engine.
I have lately noticed that after the engine is warm
(after 15 minutes or so), it begins to run a bit
rough. At this point, I pulled each spark plug cable
and noticed no change in rpm when I pulled the cable
for cylinder #4.
Spark ok.
Compression ok.
I clearly have a fuel delivery issue, but only to
cylinder 4. When I pulled the cable for cylinder 4
when cold, the rpms drop a slight bit, but when the
engine is hot, there is absolutely no change. Does
anyone have any advice for my next moves? Perhaps a
faulty injector? As always, everyones advice is much
appreciated.
