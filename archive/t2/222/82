Subject: T/L specials

  I have been asked if I would ever would have a special on 72 and later
type 2 tail light, lens and/or assemblies well here you go. 72 to 79 tail
light assemblies (complete) housing and lens, Euro or U S spec for, $30
dollars a PAIR or you can buy just the lens only (Euro or U S spec) for 12
dollars a pair. These are import (not Taiwan though) or German.  I went out
and test fit them and they fit fine. Remember these are not as good as
German, but you would have to look close to see the difference.
  I also just recieved another shippment of 1962 to 1971 complete tailight
assemblies, so I can still offer these at $35.00 a pair complete, lens,
seal, ring and housing.
  Coming soon, Euro 1962 to 71 T/L assemblies ( at a fair price)
