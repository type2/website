5 after is retarded. That is the timing spec for a 71 with a dual vacuum unit
with vacuum on the retard side connected.
IF you have the correct distributor on it, it is vacuum advance only and times
at 0.
IF this is not what you have:

"Bus & Pickup 1969-1970 * 1600

Distributor: VW 113-905-205T, Bosch 0231 137 035 or 036
Can Use: VW 113-905-205M, Bosch 0231 137 021
Replacement: VW 111-905-205AA, Bosch 0231 137 039
Points: 01 013
Points Replacement Plate Assy: 1237 110 139
Condensor: 02 007 - Note: If equipped w/AC use 02 069
Rotor: 04 033
Cap: 03 010
Coil: 00 015 (Blue Coil: 00 012)
Vacuum Can: 07 024 (Replacement uses 1237 121 400)
Ignition Wires: 09 001
Spark Plug: W8AC
Timing Set At:: 0deg TDC Static or (-at-) 800-950rpm w/strobe w/vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg (-at-) 1.3 In. Hg, 32-35deg (-at-)
3.2 In. Hg"

THEN there is no 'factory' specs to time it at. 1st you need to figure out
what you have, then time it to that dizzy. Specs given in any book or tune-up
manual are there for factory put-together engines. Deviate from that and you
can toss the book.
