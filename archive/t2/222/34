I have had all postive comments on replacing

 the points in my bus. Any suppliers for a 049 

dist type 1 engine? And of course a stupid question 

that I always sneek in. All pictures of engines I have 

seen have the coil upside down, (coil wire facing 

down). Mine is up does this make a diff? Don't coils 

have oil in them that could leak??? Sorry for the 

stupid question.

Thanks,
