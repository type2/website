Subject: Re: re muffler woes

TNX, nice to know i'm not the only one with this
problem.

It could be that my ill-fitting collars are out of
some after market muffler that was on the bus over the
years. The ernst muffler came with everything in the
way of hardware, except new fresh-air collars.
 
When I get time (and the cuts and burns heal):

Plan A: make vertical hacksaw cuts in the collars to
see if I can pinch, pound, squeeze and generally
downsize them into the heat exchangers.

Plan B: Snip 2 sheets of galv or thick aluminum
flashing to right size. Then roll them into 4" long
cylinders that will fit the holes. The hose clamps
should hold the whole mess together. Hey, it's just
heating air blowing through there...
