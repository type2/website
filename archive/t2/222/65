If you aren't going to get your deposit back - keep it. You'll be suprised 
what you can do with it.

You can take it apart and explore it. Rebuild it for a test. Trade it to 
somebody for something you need or ????

I'll bet you can salvage more than you think from it.

If nothing else give it to me.
