Subject: CV joint bolts

Over the last two weeks I have taken out the engine and transmission from my
78 Camper.  found the oil leak ( a missing machining plug on the rear of the
cases).   To seal the open hole, I used a 3/8" plug and permatex no 1,
backed up by two self drilling srews on the edge and JB Wld on top of that.

I have reinstalled the right drive shaft and CV joint without problems, but
foiled on left although I had taken off and reinstalled this one before.
Now I can not get any two of the six bolts to thread so the rest will be
lined up.  When I get one started no other will.  I put one in as an
experiment and put screw drivers and drifts throuth other holes.  However,
if one bolt is in, and one drift of appoximate size, a screwdriver inserted
through a third hole  will not match up with the threaded hole in hte
transmission drive plate.   It is possible that the wheel might have moved
between removal and reassembly, but I do not think so.  The holes in all
three, boot flange, CV joint and transmission plate appear symetrical.  Any
ideas out there?

Second problem is outer left CV joint where two of the six holes appear
blind (the ones at about 2 and 5 o'clock position.  I removed two bolts from
this side then lost them  However bolts from right side do not fit there are
no threads to catch on.   There were six in there when I began, but now two
holes that do not lead to threads in the wheel plate.  The outer CV joint
was not removed due to several stripped head bolts.  This caused me to
remove engine separatedly.  When I could not remate the engine to the tranny
with the tranny in the bus, I took both engine and tranny out, and have them
back in.
