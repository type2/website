Subject: Re: [T2] Timing question

Sent that too fast... second question, if you wish to advance the timing,
do you rotate the body of the distributor clockwise or counter
clockwise???

I apologize for these basic questions, but I am having a bad dyslexic
attack, Nikki is trying to set timing from scratch and I am screwing
things up badly :-((((((((((
