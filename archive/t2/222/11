Subject: Westfalia Replacement Propane Valves--

Hey all, 
I remenber some conversation regarding replacing the valves a couple of
weeks ago.

I just found some stored info on replacement valves that I had saved
when I was having trouble with my autostop valve in my 87 Westy.

These people are real nice, and got me the valves in 3 days--I think the
replacement cost me no more than $50.00 
What these are are the same as the old style valves found on the earlier
Type 2 Westy's--
and worked out real good in my 87---

Good place to find  replacement propane tank parts for your type 2
also--

Later,

Terry

It is run by Mike, his wife and son. They all probably know what parts.
Anyway, just tell them you have a VW Westy and you want to replace the
Autostop valve with a regular fill valve and bleeder valve and they'll
know what you need. I think their hours are 9-5 MDT.
