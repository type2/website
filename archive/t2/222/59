Subject: [T2] Re:Ball Joint Replacement 

>>Not every shop with a press can install the T2 ball joints properly.
Special tools are required. See Bentley where the
VW 471 peening tool is called out.<<

getting the ball joints in the arms is not the real problem, since
more than one vendor sells the arms with the joints already
pressed in.

the problem (at least when i did this job) was getting the arms
back ON the vehicle. that was the hard part. AMHIK.

after doing this job, i would probably pay a competent
mechanic to do it for me the 2nd time around.

good luck,
