Met a guy down in Nancy Ky. with a real nice 76 Westy about 2 months
ago.
Stopped and talked--kicked back for awhile--sipped some moonshine,
talked about Buses.

His has a build date of 11/76.
It has hydraulics, and he is the original owner.
It has 87,000 original miles on it and he told me flat out "I ain't
never touched dem valves, nor even had a hankering to think about em."

He had a shed on the side of a waller, loaded with VW's-- and sprint
cars --he builds them for 1/2 mile oval flat tracking down there--VW
sprint cars

I didn't have a hankerin to be quizzing him on his facts---besides
that--the sippin' liquor was good---:>)

Go figure.

If the Bus is a late model 76 is could very well have hydraulics-- 

GD engines were solid lifter.
GE engines were hydraulic. 
GE engines 1st appeared in Sept 77 for the 78 model year. All 76 and 77
engines [in the USA] were GD.
