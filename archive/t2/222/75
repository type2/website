I hear ya.

On the flip side, they also get flooded with:

Lowballer: "Dude, I only have $500 - can you sell it to me for that?"  
Clueless "What's the lowest you'd sell it for?"  
Clueless++ "Can I give you $50 now and make payments?"  
Clueless^2 "How about trading 2 superbeetle bodies and a squareback?"
Clueless^3 "How about $150 and an Aries K - it ran great when I parked it?"
Parts Hunter "Can you sell me just the interior and bumpers?"
Parts Hunter bred with clueless "Can you sell me just the doglegs?"

FWIW, when I was selling my '55 westy, I encountered each of these scenarios.
When the nice Japanese guy whipped out a stack of greenbacks, I had no
qualms about letting it go.
