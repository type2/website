Subject: Re: [T2] Possible fuel injector problem??

1st try swapping the electrical connecters for #3 and #4 cylinders.
See if the miss stays at #4. If it does look for a vacuum leak or possibly a
bad injecter.
If the miss moves to #3, then you have a FI problem. I would look 1st at the
resister pack for an open circuit.
But since it is temp related, it sounds like a vacuum leak. Check the hose on
the runner tube.
