Subject: needed part - thermo-time switch connector

Volks,

The wire connection snap-on thingy to the thermo-time switch on
my 78 Westy is busted,
leaving a flapping-about set of wires.

I see that BusDepot sells the switch, but where can I get the
connector? Coming months
means a properly-working cold-start valve is in order!

Thanks all!
