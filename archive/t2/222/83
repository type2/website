I had a similar vehicle, a '74 with a 1600dp. I loved it and would still 
have it if she hadn't been totalled as a result of a blown tire.

You can see her high in the mountains in the state of Zacatecas in Mexico

That "high geared" transmission currently resides in my '69 Riviera also 
pictured on the same page. Someone else installed the Westy pop-top, windows 
and 1600dp so I'm not too worried about keeping it stock.
