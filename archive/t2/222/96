[...]
   i just noted something in the diagrams and went to bus depot site and 
did a search on the part numbers.  (021 115 193)  and (N 029 7012) both 
list as oil drain plugs for basically all type iv engine buses.  there 
is one at the screen cover which is flat like the type 1 and one that 
goes into the case which is tapered.  The case  drain one  is a  14mm 
*1.5  which is the same as a lug bolt but not the same thing.
