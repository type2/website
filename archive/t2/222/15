Those pennies are pretty mangled.  All I can say is that I'm not going to 
subject my case and thrust bearings to that kind of pressure.  Also the 
3-arm puller is not guaranteed to work - in my case it simply bent the tabs 
on the hub.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I would recommend you 
not make the situation worse by trying risky things like the penny trick.
