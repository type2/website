So I am depressed because I really don't want to have to get a 
three arm puller to get that stupid thing off.  I tell my girlfriend
about Bill's solution, and then I sit around depressed.

Ten minutes later she comes up and handed me three pennies.  She says
"It only costed three cents to get that thing off."  I turned over
the pennies and see this:
