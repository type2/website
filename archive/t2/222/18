I went and looked at your penny site. It worked this time but I said
three pieces of 1/8" flat stock.
Most Ace Hardware stores have a hobby metal display that have simple
steel, brass and aluminum shapes in 12" pieces for 99  cents to three
dollars. 
Whenever you need something like I suggested I reccomend that you accept
the instructions. 
The pennies worked this time but could have broken or deformed the front
seal area rendering you with a damaged case.
The flat stock idea comes from the Hayes / Tom Wilson manual so I don't
claim genius status for relaying it.
I've got to go along with what David says, just be more careful.
Someone had given that 22 year engine good care to get it this far along.
Many people on the list have been doing the VW thing for over 30 years
and I've been at it for over eight years. 
If someone gives you questionable information or you get questionable
information from the archives just repost your request asking for a
better way.
