Spray with WD-40 every 20 minutes from now until you attempt removal.
At the parts store, find a "harmonic balancer removal tool" it's a puller
with cast metal web and a series of threaded bolts - costs about $15.
Run the center bolt of the puller down the center of the puller and into
the center of the fan hub. Then use your original fan bolts in place of the
the Pullers bolts and screw them all in until they begin to poke out the
backside of the hub. use thick washers that will hold those fan bolt heads
on your side
of the puller. Make sure all three fan bolts are evenly installed. Crank
down the puller slowly with a 17mm 1/2 drive rachet on the center bolt,
stopping every half turn to spray 40 and lightly tap the hub with a ball
peen hammer.
Be prepared for the hub to pop off - or for something to break - that means
protect your eyes
and keep your balance.
