Point taken, guys.

But believe me, nobody has taken good care of this engine until now.  I am
doing my best to get it right.  I have had to replace 90% of the tin, there
was no functional engine seal, etc, etc.  The old engine is going back to 
the rebuilder, but I doubt I will get my core deposit back.
