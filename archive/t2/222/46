Subject: Re: [T2] Worn out calipers

I just had the same problem.. '71 bus with front calipers in not best
shape.. one seizing against the rotor. I just ended up buying rebuilts at a
local parts place. I kept the cores, just in case I someday cannot get the
rebuilt calipers. It was explained to me that this was only a two or three
year run on this particular caliper and there are not a lot of rebuildable
cores or demand for them. I had bought rebuild kits at $20.00 each (sans
hardware), but after reviewing the rebuild procedure (and having never done
this before) I decided that I didn't have time now to get into it. You must
use compressed air to blow the pistons out and this is not always so easy to
do. Word of warning here, that all of the hardware for this year is not now
so easy to find. So, if you find a good rebuilt caliper for  a reasonable
price, complete with hardware, go for it. While you are at it, think
seriously about replacing the flexible brake hoses, as these also can become
obstructed internally and will not allow a good caliper to operate freely
and properly. I replaced mine. Why wait for them to fail? Bad brake hoses
may allow fluid to go to the piston, but not return. Odds are, yours are the
original, 30-year old hoses.
Regarding ball joints, a machinist with a press should be able to fix your
old ones, or you may be able to find new old stock.
