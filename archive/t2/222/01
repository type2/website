Subject: Worn out calipers

Hey all.
I have a question concerning the calipers on my 71 bus.  I have taken the
front wheels off, as well as the calipers.  For one, the bleeder valves
are both broken off, and I'm talking flush.  What should I do?  The
calipers look in hard shape.  Should I rebuild these, or just get "new"
ones?  Are there kits out there that I can do a complete rebuild, and if
so, where can I get it?  

Also, I have decided to heed the Muir's book's advice, and have a
mechanic do the ball joints, since I don't have the tools for this.  Is
this a wise choice?  Has anyone out there ever done the ball joints?

Thanks in advance,
Kyle
71 Bus
