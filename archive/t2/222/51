Subject: Re: [T2] Nikki needs HELP!, Again... & extra set  long support pans in stock

Little slow cking my mail folks but i must say i'm sorry for the
misinterpintation , i did NOT take Lasters comments as an attack, by no
means i have talked to him in irc chat and also met him at Everybus this
year a very nice guy and a fellow tenneesean (sp). (i'm a transplate form
tenn, grin) . If i take something as an attack you'll know i did my redneck
kicks in and everyone one for a couple blocks knows i'm pissed ,,Grin.
On another note , i have an extra set of the long old 3rd outtrigger belly
support pans in stock, and no one has sent a deposit or anything on, anybody
want'em?
I can deliver them to Rockingham this coming sunday for anyone in this area
and save you some shipping. Also if you need anything we can knock out
between now and then let me in know.,later and sorry for the confusion.
