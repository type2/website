Sure it could have them,
I put hydaulics in my 74, at 32,000 miles     ( original )
So it is a modified ( for the better) orignal engine--that's all.
If the Bus is a late model 76 is could very well have hydraulics--
Anything is possible--:>)

Regarding the 76 bus and why I said it couldn't have had hydraulics-, I
said this because he implied it had its original engine:

"The motor is a type 4, 2l with hydro lifters. It only has 50,000 actual

Totally possible someone did a motor swap and put a 2liter in the bus...
Rare to find original engines in these old cars.
