I'm not sure,but ron at bus depot has this part listed as available.
It has a different part no than the 1600 drain. I would give them (or
any of the other list vendors) a call & find out for sure if this item
is still available. I would sure try & hunt down the correct part from
a few more vendors than to give up quite yet. good luck.
