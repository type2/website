Yes, that is where they go.  Use a healthy dollop of anti-sieze on these
as well and you'll be happier next time these nuts come off.

If you have problems with clearance, you can substitute flanged nuts
(common on Japanese cars) with 12mm hexes.  I use these on carburator
studs and find them much easier to work with.
