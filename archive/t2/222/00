 I'm guessing it is some kind of circlip thing, but I am not able to
remove it.

Best way to get it off is by using three bolts through the threaded ears
pressing against somw 1/8" steel blocks resting on the case / seal area.
Makes removal simple. Don't forget to remove the center bolt and washer.
