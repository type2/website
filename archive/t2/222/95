Subject: Corvair conversion questions

I know there is somebody out there doing this project too. I have some 
specific questions I need to get answers for.

I am using a LM '65 110 HP engine and four speed tranny. It's going in a 
'78 VW Westy. The instructions refers to the front tranny mount from a '71, 
and rear engine mounts from the '71. A friend mentioned that I needed the 
crossbar from a '71 as well. Can anyone that has/is doing this job clarify 
the mounts for me?

Also looking for exhaust suggestions. I can fix something up but I want to 
hear about your solutions.
