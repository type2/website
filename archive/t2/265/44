Subject: Reattaching the panel vinyl.

Hi Everyone!

I just purchased a 78' Bus.  It's not a Westy top, but a Riviera (I think
that what is called).  I have been looking for one for a long time and
finally found it!  We are super excited about it.  I am now the 4th owner.
The previous owners all named her "Bess" I will be continuing the tradition.

My question is that the vinyl on the passenger door and the rear has come
unglued.  The vinyl is still in great shape, there are no cuts.  It just
appears to have come unglued.  Any ideas on the best way to reattach it?

I have another question, the weather stripping for the pop top is coming off
and the only replacement I see for sale is for the Westy top.  Can I use
that as well?

Thanks in advance for the input!

By the way, the 78 bus runs good, I have to take it in for a smog test this
weekend. Hopefully it will pass.  Since it is a 78, I only have one more
year in California until the bus is 25 years old, then I will not have to
smog it again.
