> Finally, it's worth noting that sometimes you may think you are getting a
 Bosch rebuilt unit when you are not. A rebuilt Bosch part, and a
 Bosch-rebuilt part, are not the same thing.  Technically any rebuilt
 alternator could be called a "rebuilt Bosch alternator" no matter who
 rebuilds it, as it is indeed a Bosch alternator, and it is indeed rebuilt
 (albeit not by Bosch).  It might even say Bosch somewhere on the unit,
still
 labeled that way since new. But if it doesn't actually say Bosch on the
box,
 it probably isn't rebuilt by Bosch.

I just replaced a Bosch that was rebuilt by someone else, the selenoid was
messing up and the motor had lost it's "umph". I went down to the local
FLAPS and got a rebuilt Starter for 39.99. It was a rebuilt Bosch, by
another company. I am quite curious as to how long it will last. I will keep
everyone posted as to it's performance. As of now, it starts the van right
up, no problems.
