With 99% certainty, VW dealers won't have the parts in stock but you can order them if you have the part number. They simply order them through their warehouse system.

You can't ask for items by desciption and if you say you need a distributor dust cover from a 74 they definately will shoo you away because of the vintage of your vehicle.

My local dealer can't look up parts by description for any vehicle older than 1983 because that's all his dealer ETKA software can handle. The dealer price book I was talking about only has numbers and prices, no descriptions but it still be so handy to have myself.

Lastly, the price is never less than the online vw vendors but you can sometimes save because the dealer won't charge you shipping, only tax and often the parts come in 3 days. On averge it's more to a lot more. If you are looking for a kit of items I find that these have disappeared long ago because many of the dealers stopped service a long time ago and they ran out and never restocked.
