" Your test should be a good one....make damn sure ya got your

 handy and someone else to crank while you watch."

I put a working injector onto a hose from the fuel rail Tee and hooked
up the nearest injector plug.  Friend turned it over while I watched,
got nice healthy pulsed spray.  Thus I assume the injectors are blocked,
likely by old gas in the fuel rail that did not get the benefit of the
Stabil gas additive?
