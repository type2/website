Subject: Re: [T2] Torque converter rebuild

FOR THE LIBRARY FILES

for those with auto tranny buses the torque converter has long been NLA.
I have had a couple rebuilt by a local company but until now they have
been unwilling to advertise doing it. (Type 2 converters)  The current
manager now says I can advertise this so

for type 2 torque converter rebuilding 

DelMarVa Converter Source inc
1716 Whitehead Road
Baltimore MD 21207

it takes about 2 weeks and costs $125 plus shipping (subject to change)
BE AWARE while he can get parts he has NO CORES so you must send a
rebuildable core.   This is a wholesale commercial outfit and does only
torque converter rebuilding many hundreds a week.  (they don't offer
advice or anything, ship TC, two weeks later pay bill get TC back)

I've gotten two TC from them, one that worked fine until I got bad tranny
shavings etc in it (about 5 years it still worked but I decided it
needed to be rebuilt again before I would trust it) I just picked up one
yesterday so if there are any problems with it I will post the info

YMMV
