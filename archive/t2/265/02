Subject: Re: [T2] Stupid question about dealers.

I'm not going to say for the rest of the VW dealers, just from my experience 
in getting parts from Burnsville Volkswagen, Burnsville, Minneaota and 
Westside Volkswagen, Saint Louis Park, Minnesota.  While they stock just 
about nothing for air-cooleds they can and will order anything that is 
currently available from VW and anything that has been discontinued but still 
in the warehouses.  Prices are usually more, sometimes a little more and 
other times a lot more, than the list vendors but then you know that you are 
getting original VW, not necessarily from Germany, parts.  I buy as much of 
the parts that I can (afford) from these two dealers because they have always 
given me good parts support for the '72 Westy, '87 Vanagon Syncro and the '81 
Diesel Rabbit, and the support they show for the Twin Citied Volkswagen Club. 
 Westside has paid for all of our advertising and awards and let us use their 
lot for our annual shows for about the last 14 years.  Plus they give club 
members a 15% discount on parts which really comes in handy when you get 
things like exhaust front crossover pipes for a Vanagon Syncro!  They were 
$252 before and 
about $215 after the discount.

Like I said...just my expierence.
