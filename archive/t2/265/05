Well, I think that there are some old-timers and new air enthusiests
working for VW that will go the extra mile to find the remaining aircooled
parts.  If you find one of these you have a treasure.  Our local VW dealer
has never sold an aircooled car and they are completely useless.  They
just say "not available" as soon as you mention the year.
