in my tests I had Sunoco 40wt dino oil in it, changed it out and put
Pennzoil 5W50 in it the next day.
drove the same loop of about 75 miles at same speeds and it was same temp
and conditions on back to back days.
the differences between the oils was nil

???? YMMV I am only going by my experiences...and the comments of some of
the folks that have seen the inside of my engine,  the primary reason I
pay $5 a quart for synthetic is because I ski and take my bus onto the
mountains and frequently have to start it at 0degrees early in the morning
so I can get in "First tracks"  and it almost always cranks right
over.  of course I also have twin 1,000 CCA batteries too, and on very
cold nights I even have a dipstick heater to keep the oil warm,
when I have access to power.  (and a gas heater to keep me warm)
