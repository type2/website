Subject: Sliding window swap

	I am thinking about replacing the jalousie windows in my '72 with a set of
later sliding windows.  I will probably also remove the rear vent wing
window and replace it with a solid pane from a donor bus at the same time.
	Should I anticipate any problems, or is it just a matter of buying new
seals and popping the new windows in place?  I do plan on filling in the
holes from the jalousie screws with POR Putty and hitting the openings with
a coat of POR15 before installation.

							Thanks in advance,
