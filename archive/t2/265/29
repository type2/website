Subject: headlight switch bulb

Hi all,

     Can anyone give me the part number or spec. for the bulb that illuminates
the headlight switch.  I remember my 82 westy's light switch light up but the
87 has a hole for a bulb but no bulb.  What's the scoop here?  Is this
available at the dealer?  Thanks.
