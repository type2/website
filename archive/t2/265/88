George, just like your high school, ours has gone to a Technology Lab and I
no longer teach the welding, machine shop, auto mechanics and others like I
used to and liked to.  I think we may have made a mistake not teaching the
old hands on programs, they just want students to go to Votech classes.

This is why I put together a number of machines here at home, I really miss
working with the tools.

But for all of you who missed out on the good shop programs and would like
to do a little to your bus like some body repair or even paint, check at
your local Junior Colleges and see what they have to offer.  In both Kansas
City and Omaha a number of bus guys and girls are taking body repair in the
evenings for a really low fee and working on their own busses!!
