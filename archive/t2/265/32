Dual Dell 36mm DRLA carbs work fine. I ran these on my 2.0 Type 4 powered 
Beetle. Beware of dual carb cost though. You will not be money ahead to got 
with carbs versus collecting this bits and pieces to return to fuel 
injection. You can often find a whole FI harness and misc parts for trades 
and $50 bills when you are dealing with pro-carb folks. I traded a 
postiviely AWFUL center mount Weber for a full FI system (and I got to pull 
the parts myself to ensure everything was removed carefully). No cost.

I like the carbs. They have a nice gee-whiz factor BUT they do not like 
cold wet weather. It takes a while to warm them up so that the car will idle.

Figure $100 for K&N filters (typical Speed Shop), $50+ for the linkage 
(BAS), $150+ for the manifolds (BAS), $250 for the carbs (maybe E-bay?), 
and $100 or so for the different idle jets, venturis, balancing tool, 
reference books (CB Performance), and/or trips to the mechanic if you can't 
make it go yourself. Those were 1995 prices when I gathered my parts. You 
might be able to find better prices and I got my carbs for free off of an 
Alfa Romeo AlfaSud that was going to the junkyard before I departed Italy.

I will not recommend a center mount carb. The intake runners are too long 
and in cold weather it will give you fits. I have worked on three of these 
and they all had problems. In normal cold weather (40's and below) you will 
probably have to run a heated air cleaner off of a Pinto (or the 
equivalent) to keep the carb from freezing. The duals warm up a little via 
direct contact with the cylinder head.

Most likely you will have to become your own mechanic b/c if you are living 
anywhere but CA you'll be dealing with mechanics that might not have ever 
seen a set of carbs like this. A Quadrajet carb on a Chevelle just isn't 
the same as a set of dual Dell DRLAs on a Type IV. Alot more variables.

You find the motor spinning the same rpm but working a bit harder b/c the 
2.0 has a larger bore and a longer stroke. Go with the later model tranny. 
Take advantage of that extra power.

I'm needing the little nylon plastic connector between the two cowl vents. 
Pull the front grille, and there it is right between the flappers.

Please let me know if this is available.
