Subject: Synthetic Oil

I posted a couple days ago about an apparent pressure drop after switching
to Mobil 1 oil. Those readings were takem during my usual 10 mile commute to
and from work. Tonight I had the opportunity for a little road trip, about
50 miles on the Parkway. After about 40 minutes running at 55 - 60 over
gently rolling terrain I can officially state that Mobil 1 SUCKS!!!
Absolutely the WORST oil pressure readings across the board! Oil temp stayed
in the normal range, maxed at about 220; head temps were also normal. The
pressure dropped to about 25psi at 55 mph, and for the first time ever the
oil light came on at idle.

The Mobil 12 comes out tomorrow and the Kendall goes back in. Even the cheap
NAPA brand 10w40 did better than that.

Regards,
Dave
YMMV
