Slightly until you disturb them then more cracks will appear.

You can replace them...this is what you are trying to imagine:

Be careful cutting the old hose off as you can cut into the barbs of the
fuel injector and any sharp edges of metal will cut into your new hose from
the inside.

Continental 7mm FI fuel hose is a nice tight fit.  You can put it on but
will have to cut it off.

That will be $300 please. ;-)
