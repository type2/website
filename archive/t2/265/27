Yes, the No. 1 error of newbies and even many "professionals". Don't have 
the tool so will skip that step and just test what I can, or, I did a comp 
test just 5000 miles ago and it was ok then so I will assume the current 
problem is elsewhere even though the problem is new. Bad news. If you have 
one weak cylinder, you can futz with it till JHC comes back and never 
resolve the issue. Big, Bad waste of time/money. Follow a logical order so 
you don't miss the culprit. Verify that the maintenance is all up to date. 
Half the time or more that will resolve all issues, but more especially, it 
will prevent other issues from cropping up and remove some synergy of 
problems that will make further diagnosis much more effective. Then verify 
mechanicals (valves/compression/leakdown), then verify ignition (hot spark 
at the gap), then verify fuel delivery (pump,filter,pressure), then verify 
atomization/mixture (FI or carbs).

More especially, DO NOT skip the opening paragraphs in the section of 
Bentley you are working on. It gives all the things to verify BEFORE you 
proceed with the diagnostics of that section. Skipping steps too many times 
insures a waste of money on parts replaced unnecessarily, further hammering 
your cost/mile figures.
