Subject: [T2] Removing Undercoating??

Hi Everyone,
Cleaning up my Westy so I can undercoat it but I need to remove some undercoating on one the battery trays so I can fix some rust issues.  Anybody know a easy way to get that stuff off? the trays are little fradgile these are the ones in the engine compartment but I don't know what to call them. Also anybody recommend a certain undercoating that will hold up to a vt winter? It won't be driven much but enough to go throught the PITA of reundercoating it.
Thanks
