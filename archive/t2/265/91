Subject: Intake manifold gaskets.

Hi All:

I decided to replace the intake manifold gaskets on my 82 2.0L Vanagon
this weekend. Should I use any gasket compound on these before I put
them in? Any suggestions on the best way to loosen up the manifolds and
replace the gaskets while the engine is still in the van?

Regards,
