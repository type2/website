That's OK, Mike! Why not? I just got a "book" of 13 pages off of eBay which
I'm sure must be a copyright violation. The guy just photocopied the pages
right out of one of those big old car books, holepunched it and put it in a
folder, and that's his version of a "book". $31.00 I bid for it, thinking
that it was an original book. Another guy he did the same thing to, left
negative feedback, but he's back at it again. That guy got stung for $36.00.
Oh, brother!
I have seen VW microfilms on there, too, that promise to give all kinds of
information. The problem is that you need a microfische reader to open them.
These are also exhorbitantly priced. There is even a good sounding CD out
there that I have bought that requires better video display resolution than
what I have, and I have a pretty nice setup. They don't tell you all of
this, do they?
Nope.. Some people don't worry about this stuff at all. They don't worry
about no stinkin' lawyers, neither..  They just go ahead with it. Jan B

 I hope "Kermit" as a trademark isn't protected as enthusiasically by the
Muppet corp. as VW does (-8    I guess I can't sell the tire cover I
 made with the VW bug hood logo mounted in the center!
