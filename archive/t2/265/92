This is a 74 1800 with manual trans. The engine has about 22K on an AVP
rebuild. This engine has performed wonderfully for me at all times, always
starts instantly, climbs hills well, drives through the midwest heat and
humidity with no troubles, and does not leak or consume even a drop of oil
between changes.  I had the Kendall 20w50 in it before changing to Mobil 1
and had much higher pressures at comparable oil temps and driving
conditions. (The exact same driving conditions, in fact.) So, should I worry
about my engine? Would a compression test be in order? Some other
diagnostic?

Dave
