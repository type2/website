Alternators usually die in four ways.  The bearings go bad, the diodes
fail, the regulator dies, or the carbon brushes wear out.

It's pretty obvious when the bearings go bad, and the cure is simple,
replace them.

If the alternator fails to charge, the brushes are probably bad or the
regulator is bad.  If the alternator charges, but not enough, you
probably have some bad diodes.

The brushes are cheap, so this is the first thing to replace.  Unlike a
generator, the brushes ride on simple slip-rings (not a sectored
commutator) and the current is low, so the rings don't usually have to be
turned.  just make sure they are smooth.

Next, replace the regulator.  Some alternators put the regulator and
brushes in the same package so if you replace one you replace the othar.

If this fails the fix the problem, the only thing left are the diodes.
Some diodes are easy to replace, some are difficult.  Luckily, they are
not usually the problem.

That's all there is to an alternator.  If you can get the parts they are
not that hard to rebuild.

I suspect that many of the failures of "rebuilt" alternators results from
mixing used parts from cores to create functional alternators rather than
replacing them with new parts.  The result is cheap, usually tests OK,
but may have little useful life left.

Generators, with their high-current commutators, usually require machine
work to rebuild.  You can still do the bulk of the work yourself, but
turning the commutator is a must if it is not smooth.
