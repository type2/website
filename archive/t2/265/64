Well, now.. Let's not scare him. Lets see what happens with the smog check
today. And regarding those parts, plan on buying a few to put aside, if you
plan on keeping your bus for the long term. It's worth it and still cheaper
than getting into a new car loan, especially if you can get some good parts,
used.
I do know this much.. It's getting to be a PITA to live in California, and
they're trying to work the title transfers now to where you run into
problems easily. More go to the crusher that way, and salvage is a big
business here. The Chinese need steel scrap, and lots of it. If you wonder
where all the VWs have gone, they might be in this years Chinese Christmas
toy exports or maybe some of those Chinese AK-47s that are showing up in
global hot spots.
