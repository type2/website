yes and no but I would give serious consideration to going with the FI, if
you decide to try carbs, keep ALL the FI stuff so you can swap it back in
when you decide you have had enough of the carb problems  ;8*}

you will have to change the flex plate to a flywheel (Don't forget to
reset the end play) also will need to use the 72 starter the auto tranny
uses a different starter

not if you don't swap the trannies,  also you will need a new accelerator
linkage because the auto tranny uses a special short accelerator cable (it
only runs to the tranny with a solid linkage to the engine)

??? but the extra low gearing may be to your advantage considering where
you live.

don't think so.  the rear mount may need some new holes in the frame as I
think the engine/tranny is longer than the 72 but not sure others I'm sure
will jump in on this

oh don't bother trying to save the half shafts for your bus, the auto
tranny half shafts are different length, although the CV joints are the
same.  

of course you could always rebuild the 79?!?!?
