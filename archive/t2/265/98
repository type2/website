  I switched to Mobil 1 15/50 3 oil changes ago and will never use dino
again. The engine had 15,000 plus miles at the switch and have added 10,000
more since then, smoother, cooler and less consumption.

you might also take this as a caution that bearings or other surfaces are
worn, ALL synthetics have a smaller molecular size than dino and will leak
past loose bearings etc....this is typical of synthetic.

my mobil 1 in a recently rebuilt engine (10,000 miles or so) and at 220
temps at 55mph it goes no lower than 45psi, and so far the oil light has
not come on, in fact about 25psi at idle

2 liter FI stock except for pertronix

YMMV
