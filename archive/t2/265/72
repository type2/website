Hi Chris,

For us busdrivers from the Great White North, that's our Thanksgiving 
weekend. We'll be celebrating with a "Fall Colours Tour" 
http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/falltour2002.htm There's even talk 
of a burrito breakfast on Saturday!

The weekend after that I am planning on coming south for John Brown's 
Buses:

Sure hope to meet some type2 listmembers at these events, eh? Cause 
after that you won't see me again until EveryBus 2003. -- Bob the 
Tomato HATES road salt.

Happy trails,
