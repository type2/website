Don,

You can use a number of things, but some work better than others.

The panel and the vinyl will have "dry" flakey stuff on it that you need
to get off by brushing or vacuming well.

Then you can either use 3m weatherstrip or the spray "headliner and carpet 
glue".  The guy at my local upholstery shop says the stuff he uses(spray 
or paint on) is better than the flaps spray.  If you buy the spray stuff 
at the local flaps, make sure it is "heavy duty headliner and carpet 
adhesive" in the tall can...not the other stuff in the short can.

3m weatherstrip will hold well, but you need to be able to spread it out 
well cause it may end up looking lumpy.

Plan on several clamps to hold while drying....lay it in the sun first so 
that the vinyl is nice and stretchy.

Cheers ,dave
