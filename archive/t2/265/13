Subject: Measurement needed

Hello list,

My emblem questions continue.

I need to know where the emblem mounts on the nose in relation to some fixed 
point. Obviously it is centered but I need a horizontal measurement like 
from the bottom edge of the front grill to the center (or outside edge) of 
the emblem is blank distance. Or from the spot weld seam at the bottom of 
the nose up to the center (or outside edge) is blank distance. If that makes 
any sense.

It's for a 78 Sagegreen Westfalia that should be painted this week! The 
emblem ('73-'79) is about 7 inches in diameter and attaches with three 
plastic clips and drilled holes.  I currently have no drilled holes in my 
nose. (spare tire mount holes were welded shut)

Or has anyone attached this with out the drilled holes by using some kind of 
adhesive?

Thanks a million,
Brandt
