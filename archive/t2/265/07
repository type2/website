Subject: Dual carbs section is up!

Good day gentlemen's,

After 15 hours of work on my dual Solex 34-psid 3/4 and 10 hours
building the web page,  the rebuilt procedure section is up and running.

http://www.letambourin.com/west_carbu_rebuilt1.htm

I hope it will help a few.

Many more sections to come, i already have 200 pictures taken.

Always bookmark my main engine page as the rest can move, not the main
page.
If you have any comments please feel free to do so!

Best regards, Ben
