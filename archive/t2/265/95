Subject: source for engine door carrier(??)

Hello list.

I was wondering if anyone knew of a vendor that ships engine door
carriers. Its the piece between the rear hatch and engine door (the engine
door hinges bolt into threads in this piece). On mine it looks like the
door got torn off, there are holes where the threds used to be and a PO
riveted the hinges to the carrier, creating a nice place for rust to
develop......causing the door to finally fall off, wwith nothing left to
work with. 

I thought about making my own, welding some nuts with the correct threads
to a strip of sheet metal cut to size to replace the lower piece, and then
once that is welded into the bus, cover it with another piece of sheet
metal cut to size. 

I would only  like to do this as a last resort. There are lots of man
hours involved in that and right now time is more precious than money, and
im short on both. 

Ive looked at some doner busses too... but the bolts are usually rusted in
or stripped out on east coast junk busses. :(

does anyone  out there have one that they would be willing to sell. or at
least know of where to get one?

I only really need the passenger side, but i think it might be easier to
do the whole thing, just so i can't screw the measurments up.


has anyone done this before. is there anything i shoudl look out for.

once this is done the bus gets her long awaited paint job , so i am eager
to get it done soon.


thank you list.
