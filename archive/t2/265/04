Adam,

Please re-read the post...it distinctly said "Bosch" on the starter.

It may have been rebuilt locally with parts other than Bosch, but still 
has a nice warranty...better than you get with a new Bosch product.

The difference in price pays for AAA or cell phone towing service for
*more* than a year.

You pays your money and you takes your chances...your "new" starter
might crap out in the middle of nowhere also.

I have choosen to save $200+ on the starters for 4 vw's that I have 
installed in the last 4 years.  They haven't always been as ceap as they 
are right now for new ones.

You may like "new" better since the price is closer to rebuilt now.

Cheers, dave
