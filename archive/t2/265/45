Subject: Moab, Utah, BUS HELP

   Richard of Rustybus fame is broken down 40 miles outside of Moab about 20
miles from I 70?. He thinks he broke a valve stem and is stranded. He is on
his way to Colorado and needs some help. He is going to try and disable the
broken cylinder and limp the Rustybus into Moab for repairs. If there is
anybody in the area that can help PLEASE CALL ME 928  680 7664.
