Hello Dave and list    oh yes they have a lifetime warrenty, you will spend a 
lifetime changing them. LOL  yes they say Bosch on them but rebuilt by 
someone else, probably south of the border or Tawinize  or wherever . I offer 
my custmers the choice but tell them I will not quantee the labor on the 
cheap rebuilds, had one guy that I put in 4 in one day for, the money he 
spent could have paid the difference for the NEW Bosch. I have to say that 
the cheap ones have a failure rate about 10 times the Bosch ones. To each his 
own , thats why they make different color paints:)  Later and have fun  Mark
