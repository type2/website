Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Undercoating??

I would like to add to that questions, since Ive been
wondering about getting mine undercoated again.  The
factory stuff is coming loose and there is surface rust
underneath...

So question, can I just get it like Ziebart'd over the
old possibly loose stuff???
