well one of the advantages of living in a major industrial city, lots of
suppliers.   I have had ALL of my starters and alternators rebuilt locally
by a shop that has done good work for me for over 25 years.  M&G armature
on 25th street in Baltimore has done all the rebuilds, usually 24hr
service and I have NEVER had one fail.  

the owner is a bit flakey but he does good work. he's getting up in years
and when he retires I guess that will be the end of that.   the advantage
is you know what your getting and where he is if it fails! 

as always YMMV
