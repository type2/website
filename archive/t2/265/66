Hey Everyone!,

Thanks so much for all the responses. I must say, I ran down to the local
smog shop on my lunch hour and it PASSED!!  Since I got my bus I have been
obsessed with it.  So I missed a meeting and tick'd off my co-workers to go
and get the bus smogged.  Oh well....  It's just a job.

Thanks everyone!
