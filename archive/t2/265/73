Before casting stones, try and spread the blame out a little more...
If "we" (that's me, too) shop by price alone then the company with
the lowest price gets the biggest market share and drives out the
others. Most corporations consider "labor" just another item to be
purchased at the lowest cost; i.e. the most "production" per man-
hour often regardless of quality. New VW's aren't just built by
highly skilled German craftsmen, either...But then again, neither
are Mercedes-Benz vehicles...;-(
