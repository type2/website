Subject: Fuel Injectors and Fuel Lines

Hi Gang,

I took my fuel rails apart today in order to replace all the lines, but may
have encountered a wee problem...the little pigtail fuel lines that attach
to the injectors themselves are very slightly cracked (Gulp 8(

The $300 question is: Can these little pigtails be replaced, or do I have to
buy new injectors?

Thanks (I think),
