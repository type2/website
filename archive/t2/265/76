Subject: Rebuilding mechanical EGR valve on 78 Bus?

I'm trying to get my 78 bus to pass visual inspection for smog.  It failed because the EGR valve is not functional.  I took off my EGR valve and found a mess of liquid gasket on the inside.

The rubber spacer and nut that hole the sealing plate in place are missing.  I'm thinking that I can just buy another nut and use some rubber hose to rebuild it.  

Anybody have any tips or tricks to rebuild an EGR?  I really dont want to spend $200 to replace a coupld of little parts.  The valve is functional in all other apects.
