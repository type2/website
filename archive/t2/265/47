Unfortunately, in many cases, you cannot actually get a NEW Bosch at all.
Most Bosch bus alternators and starters sold today are rebuilt (and
designated as such by an "X" suffix on the part number, meaning rebuilt,
rather than an "N" suffix which would denote new).  While Bosch has been
known to occasionally ship a new part under an "X" designation, this can be
random and is not a sure thing.

These are the notable exceptions.  The following are Bosch models that I
have available NEW:
'67-75 Starter (manual trans)  SR15N  $74.95
'76-81 Starter (manual trans)  SR87X (SEE BELOW) - $99.95
'67-68 Generator  GR15N  $99.95

One note on the '76-81 starter: While I am still using the "X" part number,
the ones I have are actually new. Bosch no longer sells new ones in the
U.S., but it turns out that they do sell new ones elsewhere, so I got my
hands on some of them.  As far as I know, I'm the only one shipping new
SR87's; anywhere else you will probably get the rebuilt ones.

As for all of the other starters and alternators, it is true that the
quality on the Bosch rebuilds is generally very good, whereas if you get a
non-Bosch rebuild you are gambling unless you have specific knowledge of the
quality of the rebuilder.  And, as has been noted, a "lifetime warranty"
does not necessarily mean that the quality is good.

I offer a choice of both Bosch and aftermarket rebuilt units. I use a small
rebuilder in California who been rebuilding just Volkswagen electricals for
years.  It's a small specialty shop, not a big assembly line that rebuilds
Bus alternators one day and Ford alternators the next.  They're careful
about their workmanship (although their repainting is a bit sloppy
sometimes, not as well-polished as the neatly-sprayed Bosch rebuilds).
Their defect rate has been about the same as on the Bosch rebuilds (that is
to say, not nonexistent but extremely low), and they've stood behind their
product in the rare cases where a defect occurred.   But their price is much
lower, and there is no core deposit (so you don't have to send back your old
unit). These are designated on my website by an "OR" suffix.

I also have the Bosch-brand rebuilds, under the same part number but without
the "OR," so if you want to pay a bit more for those you can. I do run them
at a big discount, so if Bosch is what you want you'll still save money
versus typical local pricing.

Finally, it's worth noting that sometimes you may think you are getting a
Bosch rebuilt unit when you are not. A rebuilt Bosch part, and a
Bosch-rebuilt part, are not the same thing.  Technically any rebuilt
alternator could be called a "rebuilt Bosch alternator" no matter who
rebuilds it, as it is indeed a Bosch alternator, and it is indeed rebuilt
(albeit not by Bosch).  It might even say Bosch somewhere on the unit, still
labeled that way since new. But if it doesn't actually say Bosch on the box,
it probably isn't rebuilt by Bosch.
