Logan,

Bummer about living in the cold.  I did it for 26 years before moving 
south to Maui.  Not as cold as you, only in New England.

Very good article in the Library section on rust repair / sound proofing 
/ and winterizing.  Read it when I first started to work on my bus.  It 
is in the "undercoating" section of the library and is by G. Matthew 
Bulley.  This guy is unbelievable.  It is a long article but well 
written and have very good pictures to illustrate points.  I highly 
recommend it.


I insulated my bus after reading the article.  Keeps the heat out!  Also 
much less road noise.  I smile at all the postings about heaters and 
such.  I removed my heater boxes and sealed their ports two years ago. 
:-)   The down side to living here is that all vehicles rust from the 
top down.  My bus had 60, I counted, holes in the roof when I bought it. 
:-(
