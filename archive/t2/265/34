I have to agree, I had an older VW (not bus) with dual carbs and it was a
royal PITA to tune and keep running right.   the FI is "different" so it
takes thinking a little differently but once adjusted right it is almost
maintenence free and certainly trouble free, and it will start and run in
cold wet weather without problems, the biggest problem with a non FI bus
is the need to get a FI fuel tank, but you will get one of those with the
bus you are pulling the engine from.
