it's amazing how inovative we can be when we have to.  the last time my
cable broke was on the entry to the Palisades parkway in NY...got it into
the KFC parking lot and using a vice grip on the accel linkage and some
wire tied to the vice grip out the rear hatch, thru the grab handles by
the roof line and tied off to my door handle I drove 450 miles home!!!  a
whole new meaning to the term "Hand controls"

auto tranny acel cables are not as easy as manuals, they are a roaring
PITA... last time with jackstands about 3 hrs to change.  mostly because
of one connetion on the side of the tranny that is next to impossible to
see or reach.
