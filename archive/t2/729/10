Subject: Re: Bad ignition switch?? Please help  diagnose.

From Zach Freshman:

About week and a half ago, I asked the list for some help with what I
believed to be a bum ignition switch. I followed the advice I received
(clean connections, check and clean grounds) I also checked water
levels, cleaned battery terminals, and charged my battery. Now when I
turn the key, the starter turns slowly, like 1 turn per second. I
bridged the connections on the solenoid and it spun merrily along.
Is it safe to assume my switch is toast?? How can I test it? Its not
very old (< 1year)

Turning the key and having the starter turn is a good sign that everything to the
starter, on the ignition side, is working.

Have the starter turn 1 turn per second is a bad sign. It says 1 or more of 3 things are bad:

Dead cell in battery. [you need a new battery]

Bad battery cables and/or ends. [you need new cables, not just those 'emergency' ends that
bolt-on and add tons of resistance, pure crap!   and by cables, I mean both at the battery and
the one between the frame and the trans nose]

The armature of the starter is rubbing the pole shoes. [you need a new front end bushing in the transaxle or
the rear bushing is gone and then you need a new starter]   Sounds like you are jumping the 2 large posts on
the solenoid and it is just spinning? You need to jup from the top large to the small one next to it.
