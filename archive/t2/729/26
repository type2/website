I believe that better synthetic fibers today allow less plies to be as 
strong as the original 8 plies.  You can't make a 65 psi tire with a 
load range of 1800 lbs unless it is a reinforced sidewall beyond a 
passenger tire!  Also I believe the C after size means reinforced?
Karl, keep your collar cool...Nemo, cool it!
