Subject: Paint color reference, how does it work ?

Lovely P.O. gave me a color code for the non stock paint he used to on
the body of the bus : MTK 2247A. He said I can get it in any "parts
store". For me any parts store means Kragen but I do not think they
carry it... So where should I go to buy that paint ??
