Mark Said:
Hello????    Sign your posts so we know who we are returning email to.  Also post the make and year of the bus   

I say:  You are returning to my name that is in the email address already.  Does it matter anyway?  The info. is what is needed, not names.

Also, the year of the bus doesn't matter..I said "disk brakes" and that is all that is needed to assist me.  And, the "make" is Volkswagen- duh!

Thanks for the help and the sarcasm.

Bus content- thanks to all others for the advice on this.  The lower ball joints are still stuck in the spindles.  I even bent a large puller.  Would heat help?

By the way, I'm only trying to get the threaded part out of the spindles, NOT the top part out of the arms.

Thanks,  CHRIS- 1972 VOLKSWAGEN    (better, Mark?)
