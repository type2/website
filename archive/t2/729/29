Subject: Van sighting - In front of Me !

I've just spent a couple of hours driving along the A14 (in the UK) and for 
around an hour of that I was following a Type 2.

Not exciting you may think, but the thing is I was driving a Peugot 306 1.9 
Turbo Deisil. And I was happy at 70 mph -  AND SO WAS HE !

All became clear as we caught up thanks to traffic. This van was one of the 
current Brazilian ones being imported. It looks like 70mph and more was 
possible. Acceleration was as good as the Peugot in 5th gear which isn't 
bad. Body roll was minimal, at least a lot less than my '71.

Perhaps if I wish really hard Santa will add a new Type 2 to my fleet. They 
certainly are impressive.
