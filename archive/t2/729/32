customary for Bus owners to attempt to press out the ball joints. Too
much force is required, making it strictly a machine shop job.

Pressing them out of the training arms takes a hefty press and correct
tools.

Freeing them from the spindle is relatively easy.  The top one usually
pops right out, but you then have to pop the eccentric adjustor off the
spindle.  The bottom spindle is usually more difficult.  I've had good
luck with a Chevy pitman arm puller, a couple of hefty ball-peen hammers
and some appropriate blue words.
