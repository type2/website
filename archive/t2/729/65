Subject: Re: [T2] 195's or 185's?

Mike asked:


 I'm getting ready to order tires from Bus Depot, but have a question.  The
tires on my bus are the ones that were on it when I got it.  They're
P195/75/R14's.

 The curently available Hankooks are 195R14's.

 I'm going to have to replace the tires in sets, front first and then the
rear.  Should I wait for the 185/R14 Hankooks, or go with the 195's?

 Will it "be a bad thing" to go with 185's on the front until I can replace
the rears with 185's?

Bentley calls for the tire diameter to be 25.8 inches. That is the size of the 185R14.
If you go 195R14, that tire is about 26.4" and when your speedo reads 60, you are actually traveling
61.5.......   but given the great accuracy of bus speedos, you probably will not notice it:)
Here is a great site that lets you put in the correct size on the left and the replacement on the right and
shows the difference. But since no middle aspect number is really 82, you have to put 80 in.
