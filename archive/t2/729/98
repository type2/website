Subject: RE: [T2] Goop used while installing exhaust

I'm pretty sure this is the stuff that I was hearing about.  Sound's like I
don't need it though since I have new gaskets to replace everything.  I may
spend a moment or two ensuring the end are as flat as possible though.

 

Thanks for the help,
