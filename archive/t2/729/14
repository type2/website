Then go buy another tire Karl.  Go find an
185SR14 Reinforced passenger tire.  There are no
185SR14 Reinforced passenger tires on the market.
 Either buy a 185R14C tire or sit at home and
mope.  The 185R14C tires are either 6 ply rating
or 8 ply rating.  They are not a 4 ply rated
passenger tire with reinforced side walls.  

And I appreciate your zealotry of this and most
other topics.  The sad part is there are probably
some people on the list who will end up buying
P185/70/14 or P185/65/14s because Karl says that
185R14C's aren't any better.  

Happy bussin'
