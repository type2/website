This is not exactly true. Although there is little industry (and no
government) policing of ply ratings, they do have specific meaning. Back in
the days of bias ply tires, an 8 ply tire, for example, actually had 8
plies. Now they can do the same with less, so they use PR, or "ply rated"
instead of measuring the actual physical number of plies on the body of the
tire. The industry standard is as follows:

6PR = load range C = 50 psi max. inflation capacity (or more)
8PR = load range D = 65 psi max. inflation capacity (or more)

As long as the manufacturer is not playing fast and loose with the numbers,
this means either of the above meets VW's stated requirements for a Bus or
aircooled Vanagon (load range C or higher, or sidewall-reinforced). However,
as Karl has correctly pointed out, this is not to be confused with the
existence of a "C" in the size of the tire (i.e. 185R14C), which simply
means that it is a "commercial" tire which may or may not have a C load
range. A dwindling number of tire manufacturers still use the "sidewall
reinforced" terminology on some of their tires (Vredestein, for example, on
one of their Snowtracs), which generally corresponds to load range C and is
also acceptable.

It's worth noting that these sorts of specs only identify which tires meet
the MINIMUM specs for safe use on a Bus. This does NOT mean that all tires
of the same load range, or speed rating, or any other generic spec, are
identical. I cannot stress this enough!  That would be like assuming that
any two cars that have the same horsepower are interchangeable. There are
HUGE differences in performance, quality, comfort, and safety among these
tires, just as there are between various car tires.  So you use these specs
ONLY to rule out tires that are simply unsafe for use on your Bus under any
circumstances. Then you choose the best tire among what's left.

You can find more information on this, and other aspects of choosing the
right Bus tire, on our Tire Information page:
