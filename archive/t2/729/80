Might well be some debris in the carb?  Do you run a fuel filter?

The best way I've found to deal with this is to disassemble the carb, blow
all the parts and passages out with spray carburator cleaner, and
reassemble.  If proper care is used, you don't need to replace gaskets,
diaphragms, etc.

Keep track of all the parts and make diagrams as you go.

Wear proper hand and eye protection while using carb cleaner.  Nasty
stuff!

Don't forget to clean the parts leading into the carb too!  Pity if you
get the carb squeaky clean and then a new load of grit finds its way in!
