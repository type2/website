OK, call me an idiot.  I already kicked and called
myself worse names.

Cutoff solenoid was disconnected, but the wire
was hanging near the terminal.  I guess close enough
to get a bit of current flowing through it.  I don't understand
why it ran at all with it disco-d.

new problem:

Idles fine.  Press accelerator to rev it up.
25% of the time it kill engine.  Sounds like
it instantly has no gas to it.

Accelerator pump?
