BTW, one place where you _don't_ want cromoly is in the cylinder studs.
These studs are designed to stretch as the engine warms up, and chromoly
studs will increase the chances of the threads and/or inserts pulling out
of the case.  If you are a very smart race-engine designer you can
incorporate chromoly cylinder studs in your design, but they aren't a good
drop-in replacement for the stock studs!
