Subject: timing advance

Hello,

I program computers for a hobby.  Also microcontrollers.

VW's use centrifugal force/vacuum advance for timing
advance.

I was thinking I could put together a computer controlled
advance system for about $20.00 - $50

I would have to use tach input (either from a spark plug,
or directly from points) and have a crank position sensor.

The microcontroller would be about $10.00.

I'd also have to get access to the advance in distributor.
Perhaps a valve on the vacuum line to control what
vacuum gets to the distributor.

Pull the centrifugal advance out of the distributor.  Put
a sensor on the vacuum advance for crank position
sensing.  Valve on the vacuum line.

Would there be interest in a system like this?

You could select exactly what timing advance curve
you wanted.  I could program the microcontroller to
have several pre-sets, and have a switch to select
which curve you wanted.

Anybody have a list / graph of curves?  I could
derive the formula for it, but advance curve formula
would be nice too.

Rich
