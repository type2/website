That isn't surprising.  The only thing not working is the idle circuit, so
the engine will run fine on the high-speed circuit.

There used to be a plug you could buy to replace the idle cutoff solenoid,
but I don't know if they are around any more.  The only thing the idle
cutoff solenoid does is prevent "dieseling" after the key is turned off.
