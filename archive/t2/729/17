Subject: pilot bearings?

I was excited to discover the automatic transmission in my bus is kaput.
I am in process of converting the bus from automatic to standard. I just
pulled the drive plate and am missing the _____________ <fill in the
blank, please> at the front end of the crankshaft -- the pilot bearings,
perhaps?

What goes in the recess on the front end of the crankshaft and where do I 
get one?

Thanks bunches in advance,

jack
