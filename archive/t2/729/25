Subject: Re: Curtain elastic

High thee to a camping store (Campmor, Eastern Mountain Sports) and ask 
for tent pole elastic cord.   It keeps the curtains from flapping away 
at the bottom.  The Sliding door curtain had sewn in elastic at the 
bottom with an end loop that went over a plastic hook after closing it. 
  I used sew in velcro in my curtains that also went to stick on velcro 
on the walls and under the sliding door window.

  OK, I know this is a stupid question.  I've had my bus

  cords under the side windows.  What are they for?  To
  tie down the curtains?  Did the sliding door have one?
   (If so, I want one!)  I'm learning something every
