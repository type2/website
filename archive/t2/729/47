Subject: Re: [T2] Tire fairy tale

You guys are missing the whole point of this discussion.
I am trying to stop the bullcrap flying around. It is like a cowpie pitching contest.

1) STOP calling a C tire a reinforced tire, it is NOT. It is a Commercial tire.
Commercial tire load weights are 100% of their rating. Passenger car tires are only rated at 91% of their load
rating when used for a commercial purpose.
i.e. you put a P185R14 tire with a 1450 lb rating on a bus and it's true max load weight drops to 1319.5 lbs.

2) Sidewall ply amount does not designate whether it is reinforced or not. Most good tires have 2 ply
sidewalls.

3) Ply rating of the tire is the ply rating of the tread. A 4 ply tire will have 4 plies in the tread, not in
the sidewall. The sidewall may have 1 or 2 plies.

3) A 4 ply RATED tire may have 2, 3, or 4 plies in the tread.

4) In reality, load range and ply rating are bogus figures that are not true figures except for sales pitches.
A load range C passenger tire is NOT a load range C commercial tire. 99 out of 100 tire salespeople don't know
that! They all believe that you are asking for a 185/75R14 tire when you specifically say you want a 185R14.

Then go buy another tire Karl.  Go find an
185SR14 Reinforced passenger tire.  There are no
185SR14 Reinforced passenger tires on the market.
Either buy a 185R14C tire or sit at home and
mope.  The 185R14C tires are either 6 ply rating
or 8 ply rating.  They are not a 4 ply rated
passenger tire with reinforced side walls.

And I appreciate your zealotry of this and most
other topics.  The sad part is there are probably
some people on the list who will end up buying
P185/70/14 or P185/65/14s because Karl says that
185R14C's aren't any better.
