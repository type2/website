Subject: [Fwd: [Fwd: Re: [T2] [Fwd: Bad ignition switch?? Please help

About week and a half ago, I asked the list for some help with what I
believed to be a bum ignition switch. I followed the advice I received
(clean connections, check and clean grounds) I also checked water
levels, cleaned battery terminals, and charged my battery. Now when I
turn the key, the starter turns slowly, like 1 turn per second. I
bridged the connections on the solenoid and it spun merrily along.
Is it safe to assume my switch is toast?? How can I test it? Its not
very old (< 1year)

Thanks All,
