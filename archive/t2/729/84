I had the same problem a while ago. Here is what I did to fix it. I don't 
know what step did it, but it worked.

I pluged all possible sources of vacuum leaks. I have two ports on the 
intake manifold under my carb that are not attached to anything (any one 
has an idea where those should go?) so I made sure they were plugged. I 
also adjusted the manifold boots so they were in place snugly and not 
cracked. Then I verified that all the bolts and nuts on the intake path 
were torqued to specs. Some of them were a little bit loose.
After I made sure all those things were correct, I adjusted the carb mix 
and idle screws following Bentley's procedure. I had to try couple of times 
before I got it right. Just make sure that you don't tighten (or loosen) 
the screws too much or you can damage them.
Hope it helps.
