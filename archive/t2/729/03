Subject: stupid

OK, I know this is a stupid question.  I've had my bus
for five or six years and I never noticed the elastic
cords under the side windows.  What are they for?  To
tie down the curtains?  Did the sliding door have one?
 (If so, I want one!)  I'm learning something every
day from this list.  Thanks, guys....KR
