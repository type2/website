Subject: Re: [T2] Chromoly

Indeed.. to echo Barry's question, what *are* the special properties of
chrome-molybdenum steel?  (That's what "chromoly" stands for, right?)  I
remember that it was popular for use in bicycle frames about 15-20 years
ago, but I haven't heard so much about it since then.
