Your local junkyard ... Find a waterleaker Vanagon and pull the distributor,
coil, harness, DSL, and ignition module. Do not cut the wires (except for
one that goes to the ECU), just find all connectors and separate those that
are needed to get the entire ignition out.

Cost me about $30 at my local junkyard. Everything fits and you end up with
a genuine VW system that is maintenance free. Distributor specs between
type4 and waterboxer are close enough that the Vanagon distributor will work
fine. I have had this system on my camper for about a year now and it works
great.
