Subject: Vent Wing Window Seal...

Camping this weekend in my '69 Westy, I noticed that my side vent wing
window (the one rear of the left-side louvered window, not the one up
front) started leaking.  Luckily I had a tarp I threw over that side
of the bus to stop the deluge.

Time for a new seal!

I want to make sure I get the best fitting seal I can find.  OEVeeDub?
 Bus Depot?  West Coast Metric?

Thanks.
