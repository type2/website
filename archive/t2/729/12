Disclaimer....I've done a lot to VW's over the years but front end work was 
not part of what I did.

I did work at a front end shop for several years and I did change a lot of 
ball joints. Our "press" was the bench vice for support, a steel drift and 
a 5# hammer. FWIW the drifts were used king pins.
