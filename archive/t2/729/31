I use these and they work well.  However, these are summer tires, not M+S
rated for those in snow country.  Bridgestone/Firestone carries these as
they were OEM fitment on 1-ton Toyota pickups.

Be aware that the Firestone place may not keep these in stock, and may
twist your arm to switch to something they don't have to order.

If you catch them on sale, the price is reasonable.  Otherwise, it is a
bit high.

I think that next time I'll try the 195R14 Hankooks.
