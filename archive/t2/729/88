Richard,

Do you even need to guess how I knew....LOL!

Then next worse one is when it is only parially screwed in!

Accelerator pump is the most likely culprit on the next problem.

Engine off, choke open, flashlight down carb intake.
Safety glasses on.

Press accelerator and watch the fuel coming out of the discharge 
tube...the U-shaped one that should point the fuel straight down the 
carb.  

Should be a nice steady flow ending a little after you reach max throttle.

Remember when you start it up the next time that you will have several 
shots of gas already in the engine and you might need to start it like it 
was flooded.

Cheers, dave
