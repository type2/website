Between the manifold and head? A little permatex weatherstrip (any sealant will just turn into carbon up there which is what you want).

On the muffer/u-pipes/exhangers you can use exhaust putty/paste but I find that doubling up the gaskets is effective on it's own in all but extreme cases of warpage.
