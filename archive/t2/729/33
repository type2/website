Chromoly refers to a chrome-molybdenum alloy steel that is stronger than
mild steel.  If you're having problems with exhaust studs breaking it
might be worthwhile.  However, I've never had an exhaust stud break while
being tightened.  The only breaking I've seen is caused by the nut
corroding onto the stud, causing it to twist off while being loosened.
Chrome-moly will rust just like the mild steel.  It will take more torque
before twisting off, but this might well just cause the soft alloy
threads in the head to twist out.

Better to use the stock studs with high-temp anti-sieze and copper-plated
nuts.
