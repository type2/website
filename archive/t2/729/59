Just be careful which Vanagon waterpumper you get it from.  The later 
WBX's (1986-up) have no advance mechanism in the distributor.  And  
don't bypass the aircooled Vanagons -- the California-spec models, as
well as the '79 California Baywindow, came with the Hall-effect.  Even 
if you're in West Virginia, you might get lucky and find one.

Also, the only part you really *NEED* from a Vanagon is the distributor.
The rest can be sourced from Rabbits, Sciroccos and A2 Golf/Jettas.
