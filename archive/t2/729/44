Google "steel mechanical properties" and you'll find more info that you 
ever wanted to know.

Or, go visit your local college (with an engineering school) library 
and see if they have a set of the ASM Handbook. Volume 1.  Properties 
and Selection: Irons, Steels, and High-Performance Alloys. It is THE 
bible regarding materials selection.

How much do you want to know? Some Materials Engineers spend their 
lifetime learning about the characteristics of ferrous products.

Harking back to my days spent in the heat treat department of a major 
defense contractor....

4130 = High strength. Heat treatable to 180ksi tensile. Weldable 
without giving up  mechanical properties provided that it's properly 
normalized and heat treated (anneal, austenize, temper) afterwards.  
(Which it became popular for aircraft manufacture in the 1940s and 
bicycles in the 1960s.) Large cross sections will not through harden. 
IIRC, anything over 1/2" in cross section you wanted to use 4340 which 
you could through harden to 2" if memory serves.

A better choice might be 13-8 PH CRES.

The study of the characteristics of various metals was fascinating. I 
absolutely delighted in working there every day. Forgotten most of what 
I learned though.

The first lemming to lead his peers off the cliff is a bold and 
decisive leader.
