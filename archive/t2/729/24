Hello Jonathan     Chromoly is stonger than reg. steel  but dont think
that it wont break or bend cause it will.  I really dont think it is
needed for exhaust studs , uses are more for push rods and head bolts
later and have fun.

the tensile strength is stronger than steel that is if you pulled a piece
from both ends steel would fail first.  i would guess thats the reason
someone would push it as a material for studs.  how well i know that
chromoly bends, i have bent several chromoly bike frames :(.
