Points, timing are correct.

1600 dual port.

Starts fine.  You have to rev it up to keep it running.
When you let off the gas it runs rough for a moment
and then dies.

I think this is a problem with the idle jet on the
carb.  Anybody have any other ideas?

Also, anybody take apart a carb recently
and messed with the jets  that can give
me some pointers?
