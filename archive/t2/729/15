Subject: Group buy of compufire CDI points replacement

http://aircooled.net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=IGN0001&cartid=

I can buy 1 for myself at $70.00

If 4 other people want to buy one, it is $50.00 apiece.

I don't know why the site says "180.00 for 5 units".  That would
be 36.00 apiece.

Email me if you'd like to buy one and we can all save
$20.00


anyone know where to get "points replacement"
for cheaper?

Rich
