Subject: Re: [T2] spindles and ball  joints/ splash pan rubber

My apologies on that last sarcastic retort to Mark's sarcasm.  I meant that to go to Mark only but messed up my posting.  And, it was meant in jest, not to be mean back.  Mark is awesome.  I normally avoid any controversy or confrontation.  Sorry, disregard it please.
 
Bus content- has anyone come up with a good plan for replacing the rubber on bumper splash pans?  I found one posting in the archives that is pretty complex.  There has to be some sort of rubber seal made that is very similar?

Hello????    Sign your posts so we know who we are returning email to.  Also post the make and year of the bus   

I say:  You are returning to my name that is in the email address already.  Does it matter anyway?  The info. is what is needed, not names.
