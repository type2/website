Key point that may make it interesting for bus drivers if it ever goes to
passenger vehicle sales:

"Additionally, Michelin has increased the lateral stiffness by a factor of
five, making the prototype unusually responsive in its handling."

"Lateral stiffness" = "Sidewall strength" and the design does look like it
would be inherently resistant to sideways flex and "roll".
