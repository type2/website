Subject: Update on Striped Oil Drain Plug

Just to bring everyone up to date, my last oil change resulted in the
removal of about 1/2 of the case threads for the oil drain plug.  I was
advised to try a TimeSert Kit to repair the case.

The engine, CV type, had already been retapped to 14mm, so a new 14mm drain
plug was obtained as well as the 14mm TimeSert Kit.  The TimeSert Kit worked
perfectly.  I does take two people to do this with the engine installed.  I
also used a lot of Q-Tips to make sure there was no metal left in the case
from the taping process.

Final result: a perfect, tight fit for the new drain plug.

Now I just need to get some parts for the Oil Filler, and I will be back on
the road again.
