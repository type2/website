Subject: Re: [T2] stupid curtain question

From Kevin H. Roberts

OK, I know this is a stupid question.  I've had my bus
for five or six years and I never noticed the elastic
cords under the side windows.  What are they for?  To
tie down the curtains?  Did the sliding door have one?
(If so, I want one!)  I'm learning something every
day from this list.  Thanks, guys....KR

'76 Bopmobile (Westy Camper)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The rubber covered spring below the side windows [on your 76] held down the bottoms of the curtains.

The rear hatch uses a upper and lower bar and the curtains have the same hem top and bottom. None of the other
curtains have this same matching hem.

The one-piece that goes around both front doors and windshield just hangs.

The sliding door curtain has no spring. It has [more than likely had] a sew-in white string loop on the bottom
front corner. It hooked to a clear plastic hook mounted on the B pillar. After you slid the curtain closed,
you hooked the loop. Then the next morning, half-asleep, you forgot about it and slid the curtain back.......
86'ing the loop:)   The rear end of the curtain was held in place by the tie-back screw, like all the others
except the front.
