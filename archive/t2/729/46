I don't think so - I believe that Type 1 and type 4 distributor specs are
different. You may be able to use a waterleaker distributor to modify your
original distributor. I think Karl has written a post at some point about
installing the hall pickup in a conventional distributor - check the
archives on this.

However, I have little experience with type 1 engines.

Any idea whether this would be worth trying on a 1600DP?  Folks seem to be
recommending the same SVDA for both the T1 and the T4 engine, so I'm
curious.  I gather that the T1's definition of "too much advance" is more
conservative than the T4's.
