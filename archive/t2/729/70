I really like my Kumho 857 185R14D tires.  I paid ~$120 installed
(total, including tires, valves, balancing, etc) from a local shop for
two.  Anywhere that sells Kumho (usually the independent mom and pop
places) can order them, and they are great tires for the money.

My rear tires are still the Kumho 852s that I bought ages ago, worn
down now but not gone yet.  Good wet weather traction and I can't say
enough about the quality of these tires.

No experience with the Hankooks, but for the price difference I can't
see paying a premium for them.
