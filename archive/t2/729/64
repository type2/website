Hello Chris  Apologies accepted  Yes some times I can be sarcastic I just 
think its good manners to sign your posts, I look at it just like calling someone 
on the phone the first thing you do is tell them who you are, just good 
manners  .    As for the splash pan seal take an american type fuel line a split on 
one side so that it will slip on the pan.  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
