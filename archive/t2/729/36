Subject: RE: [T2] EveryBus Milage Figures

I don't have the exact amount of gas used etc, but we seemed to average
about 18 mpg.  This, with a 63 double cab / 1600sp / single pict31.  The bed
was fairly loaded and we had three passengers.  Round trip was roughly 3300
miles.  I would guess we average anywhere from 50 to 60 mph usually.

*sigh*  I need to sit down and get my EB trip report done.

   Just sat down to figure out the mileage obtained with the 73 Westy 
during our trip to Everybus
Total Mileage = 1578 miles
Fuel Used = 71.82 US Gallons /  59.8 Imperial Gallons
21.97 mpg (US) !
26.39 mpg (Imp) !!
