They can be stubborn!  Heat might help, but I'm talking major heat, not a
propane torch!  You need to heat the thing fast to do any good.

One technique I've had luck with is the 2-hammer pop-the-taper shot.  You
get two hefty hammers (I use a big ball-peen and a small sledge).  Hold
one hammer against one side of the spindle and then whack the other side
of the spindle with the other.  The striking axis should be perpendicular
to the axis of the ball-joint stud.  The idea is to flex the metal of the
spindle to allow the tapered stud to break loose.  It's a good idea to put
some pressure on the stud with a puller to help it on its way.  It gets
really busy in there, but it can be done with a Chevy pitman arm puller.
