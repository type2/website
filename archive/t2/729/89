Subject: A real puzzler for a T2 wiring guru...

This one has me stumped. I'm resuscitating a 1970 Kombi which has been 
abused. After replacing the flasher relay (4 pin) and the turn signal 
hardware I finally got everything working except this little problem:

With the ignition off and the emergency flasher button pulled, all the 
appropriate lights flash, including the dashboard indicators (green). If I 
then turn the ignition switch to ON the dashboard indicators stop blinking, 
even though the running lights are still flashing, along with the red light 
in the switch.

Plus, with the ignition switch on, emergency lights off, and turn signal 
activated (left and/or right) the green indicators again do nothing but the 
appropriate lights flash properly.

Why should turning the ignition switch on kill the indicator lights?

Bright lights and the high beam indicator, brake lights and instrument 
lights and oil and ignition warning lights all work fine.  I even got the 
bloody dome lights working.

I've been staring at the wiring diagram for two days and have had no 
insight other then to realize what I would call ground is hot and the 
flasher completes the circuit by grounding the bulbs. The hot circuit feeds 
the oil and ignition warning lights, too,  and they work fine. The real 
killer is that the press-to-test brake system indicator light also works 
fine. That is on the same hot circuit as the turn signal indicators. A puzzler.

All I can imagine is that the ignition switch is .. well, hell, I don't 
know. Grounding out something?  Sucking current? Casting an evil spell?

Thanks and aloha from Hawaii...
