Well, I suppose that's what happens when you don't watch where you click.
Look for the "finished" version later tonight.  Enjoy the sneak preview.

Well, I am finally getting around to the trip report :-)  

 

We decided well in advance that we wanted to take the Double Cab.  It's more
nostalgic and it was simply the thing to do.  Our plans to leave on 8th did
not last long.  Our original plan was to leave on the 8th so that we could
take our sweet time and not worry about rushing the truck.  Even though I am
not sure that it could be rushed if we tried.  Not knowing Type 1's that
well, ..................................................
