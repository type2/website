Subject: 195's or 185's?

I'm getting ready to order tires from Bus Depot, but have a question.  The
tires on my bus are the ones that were on it when I got it.  They're
P195/75/R14's.

The curently available Hankooks are 195R14's.

I'm going to have to replace the tires in sets, front first and then the
rear.  Should I wait for the 185/R14 Hankooks, or go with the 195's?

Will it "be a bad thing" to go with 185's on the front until I can replace
the rears with 185's?

Thanks.
