If you are making your own end loop, it was actually a ring made of 
white plastic about 0.5" in diam, which you will find as curtain 
accessories at a fabric shop like Joann's.  It was sewn at the end of 
the curtain.  For the hook, go to Home Depot and ask for mirror wall 
mounts, which look very much like the orginal and have a hole for the screw.
