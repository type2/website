In that case, the suspects become:

1. bad diaphragm in the fuel pump, allowing fuel to enter the crankcase.
2. leaky float valve in carburator, allowing fuel to trickle into
cylinder, past rings, and into crankcase.  This could also cause hydraulic
lock in the cylinder, ask me how I know!

Since the tank is above the carbs and crankcase, either cause is likely.
If you happened to park the bus nose-up with a full tank and then left it
for a while (several days or more) before noticing the leak, I'd suspect
the float valves.

Whatever you do, don't start the engine with an overfilled crankcase!
You'll blow out the front seal which makes a horrible mess.  Ask me how I
know!
