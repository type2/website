Subject: EveryBus Milage Figures

   Just sat down to figure out the mileage obtained with the 73 Westy 
during our trip to Everybus
Total Mileage = 1578 miles
Fuel Used = 71.82 US Gallons /  59.8 Imperial Gallons
21.97 mpg (US) !
26.39 mpg (Imp) !!

The bus was fully loaded with 4 people and all the gear.
1973 Westy with stock 1700cc dual Solex.
I find these figures excellent and contribute it to tail winds and slow 
speeds.Although that was only 1/2 the time:)
