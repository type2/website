Sounds like a clogged idle jet.  pull it out and give it a blow.  Also you could check the idle circuit solenoid switch, they can get stuck in the closed mode.  I know some mechanics they like to snip the end off of the plunger so it can't shut off the idle circuit.  Or your problem could be the float level, worn out throttle shaft bushing, choke not set correctly.  check power to both the choke and the idle solenoid.
 
The most common problem I have in poor running VW's is an old, worn out carb.

When you let off the gas it runs rough for a moment
and then dies.

I think this is a problem with the idle jet on the
carb. Anybody have any other ideas?
