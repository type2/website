Subject: RE: [T2] alternator directions

Not sure on this one but, I have contimplated an additional alt. in the 
place of the A/C Compressor I pulled off. It could be used as a welder or 
just a battery charger for many accesories. But I have to get on the road 
and take care of many issues prior to addons.
