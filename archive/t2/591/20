Subject: RE:Lost ignition key

Your bus originally had only a single key.  As mentioned, if it was still 
that way, you can easily retrieve the code number from any other lock.  I 
find the sliding door to be the easiest.  If, for some reason, the lock has 
been changed, you have two choices...either remove the ignition lock or have 
the locksmith come to you and generate a key.  Feel free to let me know if 
you have other questions.
