Subject: alternator directions

Hey guys-

If an alternator spins in either direction, it should create the same DC
current since it is creating AC that is running through a rectifier.
Correct?

Therefore, besides the fan in the pulley not being right, the alternator
itself should work just as well spinning either way?

Thanx

P.S.  Sure wish all this rain would stop or all of southern NJ will be under
water soon and Ill get to find out if my van floats!
