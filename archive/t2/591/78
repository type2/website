Subject: RE: [T2] Side Mirror Removal

Ahh, so it's NOT supposed to come out? But rather the old mirror arm is
suppsoed to slide INTO it? 





 From my memory I also believe this to be the case, hold the mirror in 
the right spot and tighten up the two sided "bolt" that is against the 
outside of the door.
Too loose and the mirror is sure to flop down at speed <grin>
