Subject: Rear-view mirror in 82 Westy

The 82 Westy has a crumbling chunk of black plastic where the original 
interior rear-view mirror used to be. The hangy-down part with the ball 
(of "Ball and Socket" fame, the Vigorous Vaudeville duo of the Borscht 
Belt) is in fine condition. What's the cheap and easy way to bang a new 
mirror up there?
