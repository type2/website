Subject: Rotor Button? Distributor Cap?

I went today to a local VW parts dealer to pick up the "Nope don't have 
'em." Bosch parts I needed to finish up this engine.

This is what they had listed for the parts I got for the VW# 021-905-205P 
distributor:

1. Rotor Button  Bosch #04012
2. Distributor Cap Bosch # 03010
3. Bosch Blue Coil #0010(Made in Spain)

I am a little concerned about the rotor button. Isn't it supposed to have a 
rev. limitter? That would be to limit it to like 5800 RPMs.

Now that I am back in town from going to get these parts and I am 
questioning them just wanted to know if they are the correct for this 
distributor.
