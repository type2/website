Subject: Re: [T2] lost ignition key

Hi Alex,

I did the same thing back in the summer of 2000.  Local locksmiths 
wanted close to $100 CDN to make a house-call to cut me a new key. So I 
asked the list and discovered www.steveslockshop.com. Steve told me how 
to get the lock number from the matching rear hatch lock, which I sent 
to him along with my credit card info. He then sent the keys by 
overnight courier, at a total cost of less than half of what the local 
guys would have charged.

If your ignition key opens the rear hatch you're all set... If you have 
a bunch of different keys then you're gonna need a house call.

Or you can swap the ignition lock cylinder yourself if you follow the 
instructions on this page:

New lock cylinders are readily available from online vendors, I 
recently installed one in a friend's bus that we got from 
GermanSupply.com.

Happy trails,
