Subject: RE: [T2] A TOUGH question to answer concisely. 

Right on, thanks man, you rock. Only I already looked in the library
under fuel, and didn't see anything about the gauge their. Maybe I'm
just being blind though. I'm off to test my sender though.  That'll
prolly be it. :) Then I'm gonna do my best to repair it. Heck, if I can
repair a double fuel relay, I'm sure I can repair a fuel sender too. :) 

Cheers
