Subject: Re: [T2] Side Mirror Removal

 From my memory I also believe this to be the case, hold the mirror in 
the right spot and tighten up the two sided "bolt" that is against the 
outside of the door.
Too loose and the mirror is sure to flop down at speed <grin>

from memory if I'm wrong I'm sure someone will correct me,

  I seem to recall that the "thing" on the outside is more a locking nut
than anything, screw the new mirror in then hold mirror and turn "thing"
on the outside until it locks everything in place....
