Scott and others that replied...

Thanks guys, It does get hot enough to not be able touch soon 
after I stop.

I have some aluminum sheet and might see about making some sort of added 
shield after I extend the dumps and see if it makes a difference.

I have added some aluminum shielding on a bug and had it make a 100 degree 
lower difference in the temp of the std sheet metal 3 inches away.

Scott, I think your physics is correct...and just learned this again the 
other day.  Left some chromed sockets in the noon day sun next to a darker
metal handled tool.  I could not hold the sockets in my hand(too hot) 
while the black metal tool was hot, I could still hold it.

Thanks a bunch, dave
