IIRC if they're not DOT approved then the manufacturer is required to
put "off-road use only" on the packaging. This just means it's illegal
to have them on when driving on a public street or highway.

Will you get pulled over? Depends on the lights and the policeman.
Anthing that isn't amber or white and you'll attract attention. Blue
especially. Here in Cali I've had coworkers get pulled over for having
the "Blue Streak" type headlights, even though there are some approved
ones now.

I'd absolutely add a relay, even thought one isn't included in the
packaging usually. Just a little bit of insurance. Enough bus's burn
up as it is...
