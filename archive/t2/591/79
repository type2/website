Subject: Am I looking at the correct hose in ETKA

Hi all:

I always have a difficult time figuring out what ETKA is telling me when it
comes to hoses.  The fabric-covered rubber hose that comes off the Decel
Valve and then connects to the clear plastic hose that then connects to the
"T" elbow on the left rear of the air distribution box is shot on my '82.
(Manual trans vehicle.)

In looking at ETKA (Model: VA, Year: 82, MG: 1, SG: 33, Illustration: 27-00)
it seems like the hose I'm seeking is Item 3 in the illustration which is
identified as Part N 904 023 01.  This part further carries the designation
"14x4".

Do you agree that this is the correct part?  I ask because the orientation
of the various bits in Illustration 27-00 doesn't seem to be correct (e.g.,
the Decel Valve is pointing the wrong way).

And, just to refresh my memory, is the designation "14x4" indicating that
the I.D. is 14mm, with the wall thickness being 4mm, such that the O.D. is
22mm?

Thanks!
