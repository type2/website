I applied some of that liner in a spray can to the trunk of a car about 10 years ago. It went on easily and looked great but the surface is not smooth. I'm not sure I'd want to use it in a dusty dirty enviroment like the engine compartment because I think it would make it much harder to clean later. I know, I know, a clean engine compartment is a dream for most vw bus owners. :-)
