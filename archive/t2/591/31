dave,

my rear bumper gets hot also. not sure i'd say it gets REALLY hot, but it is
hot to the touch. i have 72-74 system on my 79. i can't remember how not it
got before i switched over, as i too didn't drive it much.

i can see the muffler getting hotter with a 72-74 system than with stock
75-78 or 79. the exhaust inside the muffler on the stock setup takes a much
longer path: it has passed through the elbows, plus the crossover before it
enters the muffler, so 75-78 muffler exhaust should be cooler. i would also
not be surprised if the shiny stainless muffler you have radiates more heat
than my matte black one, or a stock gray painted one, though i am not
certain if my physics is correct on this point.
