Subject: Seatbelts

Since it took our state, Virginia, FOREVER to
exempt vehicles over 25 years just from
emissions, I am surprised that federal law says
the over 25 vehicle does not have to meet DOT
regulations.  

Probably the other way around.  DOT regs did not
require the seatbelts for many years.  Then they
only required front seat belts.  The states laws
with which say something to the effect that
children must be restrained and front seat
passengers must be restrained by seatbelts if the
vehicle came so equipped.  

As always, check with your local laws.  An
excellent source is www.findlaw.com.  Click on
your state, pick statutes or codes, then search
seatbelt.  Your highway patrol may also be a
helpful.
