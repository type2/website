Chris, 

If yours are  the same as mine on my 78, then you are supposed to be able 
to turn it and have it come out.

Simplest thing to do is take your door panel off, roll the window up, and 
then just look....I'm betting that the "captive" nut on the inside is just 
not captive any more and just spinning around.

Cheers, dave
