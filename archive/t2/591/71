Subject: front end clunk

I recently replaced a ball joint (which had a torn boot) in the 
passenger side upper torsion arm of my '78. At the same time I replaced 
the clamps and rubber bits on my stabilizer bar. Since that time, I 
have had a rattley clunk sort of noise somewhere in the front end. It 
only makes this noise when I drive on a fairly uneven and rough surface 
(such as my  driveway which still has divots and potholes from last 
winter). On the road I don't hear anything.

I have tried standing on the bumper and bouncing up and down to 
reproduce the sound, and hopefully identify the culprit. But although I 
can get a pretty good bounce going, it doesn't make the noise. I have 
pulled sideways on the tops of the front tires to rock the car, but 
also no noise.

Any ideas what the noise is, or what I might do to identify the noise?

  I have also replaced the calipers, rotors and bearings, and installed 
new shocks and a new steering damper, so I don't suspect any of these 
items.

Thanks.
