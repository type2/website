Subject: Mystified re late bay horn curcuit

The horn on the 75 worked when it felt like it, and finally stopped.
Horn showed proper 12 volts on one spade and blew if grounded to other
connector.  So we checked the connectors and rubbing areas and rubbing
areas starting with the horn button.  We cleaned the contacting surfaces
under the button ring (rather oxidized).  The late bay wire to the
button ring does NOT go down the center column; it goes through the
wheel itself and ends in the brass contact ring under the wheel; this
rubs on a brass "springy plate" that also needed cleaning.  My ohmeter
showed continuity between this and the outside collar of the steering
column, which itself showed continuity to ground.  WTF? the center
steering column also showed continuity to ground, so what is really
being switched when the button ring when pushed connects to the center
"ground"??  Checking under the column showed that the jumper wire over
the rubber isolation pad was separated, so I soldered it back onto the
still extant spade and horn works great.  I am STILL mistified as to how
this works- I followed the 2 wires to the horn, and they go inside a
stock harness that disappears back into the front cavity of the bus -
they go nowhere near the steering box or center column, nor is there any
spade at the bottom of the column.  Bently was not helpful.  Can anyone
explain just how the horn actually gets grounded based on what I
observed??
