Marya,

I'm betting you might be able to find one at the junkyard or someone in a 
local club there?...are they really "moon" style?  with or without logo?
or the flat style?

Get one with minimal rust cause even powder coating will not hide pits
in the surface if they are very deep.

$125 sounds a little steep to me, but maybe that's just Portland.

Cheers, dave
