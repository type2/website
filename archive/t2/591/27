Subject: Welding Body Panels

The thread about the nose swap made me remember...

What kind of welding rig do ya'll use? I assume an arc welder would be
too hot and just burn holes in my bus, but would a mig welder be ok or
should Oxy/Ace be more appropriate?

My bus has lots of panels that need to be replaced and I've used all
three, but only O/A for sheet metal. I like migs, but the rigs are
expensive, and arc's are fun but hot.

My bus needs a full nose, pass rear corner, and sliding door skin...
