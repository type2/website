Subject: Anyone bussing their way to gathering of the vibes?

If anyone is bussing their way to gathering of the vibes, (insert hippie 
joke here) and would like to get together or just look out for one 
another, let me know. I will (most likely) be taking my 72 westy 
(Pumpkin orange bottom/ Brown upper) from NW CT to GOTV, in now and this 
is only a 150 or so mile one way trip.  But would like to have some bus 
friendlies looking out for me. Anyway, Let me know - Jeff
