None personally. Just documenting what's out there.

Ron Salmon might be able to sort out that mess.

I don't think it fits, right?

I changed the rotor on my neighbors lotus a couple of weeks back. There was metal dust all over the inside of the distributor. It turned out that the PO had put in the wrong rotor and it had ground down the terminals in the cap as it spun. The shaft didn't seem wobbly and I was surprised the damage wasn't worse.
