On my 74, there are two knobs and one lever under the drivers seat. The
lever slides the seat back and forth, the large knob moves the seat back
angle, and the small knob on the rightward side closest to the
walk-through is a push-pull knob that is attached to a long cable that
sets the thermostat temperature for the gas heater. 

This thermostat, like Vince mentioned, sits on the gas heater ducting next
to the fuel tank inside the fuel tank compartment. I believe that pulling
the knob out gives the highest gas heater temperature. 

I have seen pictures in the owners manual as well of a dash-type knob
mounted underneath the seat, also to control the gas heater, but it should
have some sort of logo on it.
