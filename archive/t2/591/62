Subject: White Hub Caps

Thank you Mike and Chris -
I called the power coating people Mike suggested, here in Portland, and to 
sand-blast and coat 4 hub caps would be $125.00.  I could handle that I 
spose.  Problem is, I'm still missing one original moon style hub cap.  Any 
thoughts on where to find one - regardless of finish?
Thanks a bunch!
Marya
