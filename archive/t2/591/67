Doh, I was afraid of that. It's spinning rather easily now, but I can
see (I think I can anyway) something like a nut spinning on the inside
too. Does the mirror mount screw into a nut that's welded on the inside?
If so, I think I may have broke off that nut. 

I wonder how JB Weld would work at re-afixingthat little nut. :)
