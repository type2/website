Subject: Re: [T2] Side Mirror Removal

The threaded bolt on the inside of the door is not supposed to spin when you
spin the collar (BTW, a 19mm openended wrench fits perfect there, and
doesn't mar up the chrome like channel locks do, ask me how I know).  The
proper way is to just unscrew the mirror with a wrench, like you are doing.
You might want to hit the threads with some penetrating oil, let it set,
then tap with a rubber mallet while turning to see if you can get the
threaded end of the collar to spin out of the threaded holes.  What might be
happening is the threads are seized, and somehow you are spinning the
threads out of the door itself.
