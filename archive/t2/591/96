Subject: Windsheald washer leaver

Hello fellow VW Knights,
 
I have a 1976 Van.  When ever I add pressure to the windshield washer tank
it leak at the steering column.  I have removed the steering wheel and now
I'm having trouble getting the rest of the system apart.  I would like to
replace the lines if that is what is needed.
 
Please Help! Pictures would be a bonus.
 
Thank You.
