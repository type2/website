OK, I gotta know:  How did you get two lovely young ladies in scanty outfits
pose next to your bus!?

I've been driving a bus for over 13 years and all I've ever managed to
photograph with my bus is 
   a: guys with loud Hawaiian shirts and beer bellies
   b: skinny guys with long hair that haven't bathed for 2 weeks
   c: guys with no shirts and goofy grins  

Being a guy myself (and fitting each of the 3 above descriptions at some
point or another), I really don't find any of my bus pictures worthy of
posting to the list and saying, "Hey!  Look at these great shots!"

So what's the secret?  Blinding good looks?  Telling them you work for
Rolling Stone?  Cash?  

I feel like Wayne and Garth in "Wayne's World" when they meet Alice Cooper,
"We're not worthy!  We're not worthy!"  :)
