I got ya' beat on that one man. I need at LEAST 3 other parts welded in
on tope of those. :) I'm personally gonna use a MIG, simply becouse it's
the only welder I have available to me. For me, on the sliding door,
it's rusted through on the very bottom. I've never had good luck with
skinning doors (ok, I only tried once, but what a flop) so I'm thinking
I might try just cutting out the bad part on the botom and sticking in
some sheetmetal instead of doing the whole skin. Or maybe just
FiberGlassing it. 

Let us know  how your welding job goes. Take pics if you can. Body work
is a ways off on my priority list, so I won't be doing it for a couple
months I don't think. 

Cheers
Chris
