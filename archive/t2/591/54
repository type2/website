Subject: White hub caps

Hiya-

The camper I just inherited originally came with white hub caps (70 
ASI/Riviera pop top) - it is clear in the brochures which I also came 
across.

My questions are:

1. Has anyone out there seen this/heard of this before?  So far no one else 
I"ve talked to has ever heard of anything but chrome.

2. If so, can you suggest a place that sells them?  I've heard there are 
black ones ready to be painted, but of course I prefer to buy them white.

2. One is missing, and the other three suffer from some rust.  I was 
planning on scrubbing, sanding and treating, but then I'm not sure how I 
would best paint them.  Can someone suggest the best method and paint - for 
that smooth factory look?  Do the professionals do that (those who will 
paint the whole exterior of the bus)?

Thanks for your time!

Marya
