Anyone interested in a group buy of this item??  At least -6- needed to get 
out of extra $17+ S&H charges.  Please PMail me. Thanks

Possible distribution at Buses By The Corn. With normal shipping, the cost 
would be a $10 spot.

If you haven't tried this on your distributor 'long' locking nut, you are 
missing the joy of timing your VW, the pleasure of making a rather simple 
job actually idiot proof.
