Ron,

A buddy of mine with a *large* displacement T1 engine bought one from the 
local guys(Oklahoma) who invented it(I think)...he said it worked great 
and reduced his oil temps about 15 degrees and head temps even more.

He has some serious instrumentation in his bug.

I am almost certain his pulleys are std/std size.

I believe it will help as I have seen tests done that show most cooling is 
lost cause the fan slips...even when tightened correctly.

As always...YMMV

Cheers, dave
