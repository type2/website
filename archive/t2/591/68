Yes that coil does refference other watercooled VW's and not aircooled VW's. 
I did a double take with your coil page. It is just like the Mexican Coil, 
one of the uglies. What problems did you find with them? The box says Mexico 
and the Coil says Spain.

>1. Rotor Button  Bosch #04012

>009 rotor. Get 04033 instead.

About the rotor button, do you know of any reasons why it will not work? Or 
if it will work but could lead to damage later?
