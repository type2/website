Hi every one. I just wanted to introduce my self to the type 2 list.

My name is Patrick, From Springfield, MO. I own a '77 Transporter--pastel
white and sage green. Currently the engine is out and being worked on after
discovering the #3-4 head was heavily damaged after a valve guide was sucked
through the intake valve. OUCH!

That9s my story. Thanks in advance.
