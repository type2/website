Subject: RE: [T2] lost ignition key

Alex,
Did the key fit anything else on the van (door, engine compartment)? If so,
it may be possible to take the cylinder from the door, etc. in to a
locksmith and have a key made. Urban legends abound about keys being hidden
in weird places, like in the heater tube under the van, by the factory, but
I think they were probably put there by POs. I keep a key hidden on the
outside of each of my vehicles in a weird place.
