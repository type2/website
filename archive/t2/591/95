Subject: Re: [T2] using "aux/fog" lights

I agree, most of the things on my cars say "offroad use only".... thats
where the fun is.  Unless there is something blatantly bad about them, like
blue light or blinding brightness, then you'll be fine.  Most cops dont know
enough about cars to know what is legal and what is not.

Yeah, run a relay for something that powerful.  It'd be too much current to
run through a switch, you dont need to make your bus into a BBQ.
