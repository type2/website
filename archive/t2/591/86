Subject: Torque for fan/pulley bolts

After my disaster stripping the bolts on my fan/pulley (I separated the two
for painting) I decided to look into fastener torque and the more I read the
more information I find. I had no idea what an involved discipline it is.

Some folks sent me what they thought the torque value should be and everyone
sent a different answer. The first suggestion was overkill and stripped the
bolt. This is what I've learned:

Torque is related to fastener size AND grade. Torque also changes depending
on the material (iron vs. aluminum etc) and the lubrication used.

Several chart exist to show tightening torques and they all seems to give
slightly different answers.

The bolts that hold the fan to the pulley aren't quite M7 in size (6.85mm)
and look like 10.9 grade CV bolts. This would suggest that the correct
torque would be about 18 ft. lbs. if the bolt/nut were new.

That's my recommendation for anyone attempting to torque those bolts back up
and I'd use a dab and only a dab of blue loctite for insurance.
