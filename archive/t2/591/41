Subject: Lining the engine compartment...

Hello. Thank you for all the help on my previous questions. Now for a new question... So, I'm thinking of using an undercoating or bedliner in the engine compartment of my '73.  I went down to autozone and one of the employees showed me this bedliner in a spray can and said it took three cans to undercoat his antique car with it. He recommended it. There were other kits containing a roller type brush which I don't think would manuever well in the engine compartment. Concerning the future possibility of rust, would bedliner be a good choice? The rhino lining stuff is a bit too tough for this application, in my opinion. Also, impractical as far as applying it as I would like to get this done as long as the engine is out and I would need to drive the bus to get to a place that does rhino lining. Any experience with these bedliners? Should I do it? Also, what should I paint my brand new heat exchanger with to prevent rust? Thanks, list.
