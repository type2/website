>>Query #2. Looking at a 12volt original refrigerator to go behind the
passenger seat in my 70 westy and replace the ice box/sink combo. How long
will it run on a fully charged auxiliary battery? Does anyone know the
amperage draw or what size converter is needed to run off shore power? Does
it get cold enough to make ice?

Type 2 list, I have a 12 volt converter from a '79 Westy which might be what 
John wants want.  About $20 plus shipping (actual cost)

I also have the panel that shows the condition of the aux battery (I think)

I can take  quick pictures when I get home and send them to anyone 
interested
