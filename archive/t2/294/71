Subject: BA6 has to go...

I'd like to get rid of my collection of BA6 stuff.

I've never been able to get the time to assemble it all and try to test 
it. I can't guarantee the condition of any it, other than what it looks 
like. Heater came from an 81. The underdash safety cutoffs came from my 
77. Other wiring is still in my 77, but I haven't been able to get it out yet.

List has first crack at it before it goes to a large, unnamed internet 
auction site. Would trade for a few watercooled A2 things I'm looking for.

Someone may also want a Cessna 182 Seat to turn into a really nice 
jumpseat for their bus ;)

thanks for looking.
