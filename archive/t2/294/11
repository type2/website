Subject: Canadians traveling in TN?

Last night at my local Dickson, TN Wal-Mart I noticed a green (prob
78ish) westy w/ Ontario plates parked in the parking lot. Window
shades up & it looked like they might be asleep. Anyone know of anyone
traveling through the south this week? Wasn't sure if it was a list
member or not.
