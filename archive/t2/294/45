Thank you Mick for a well written reply.

Someone wrote about 6 to 9 months on the list that every bus will cost 
about $5000.  Buy it fixed up or buy junky and do it yourself and you 
will end up spending $5000.  It is true in my case; $750 initial cost, 
aprox. $1700 for parts (thanks Bus Depot and Rocky Mountain), and $2700 
for painting.  Bottom line $5150.  By buddy bought a fixed up '74 camper 
for $5500 straight.

Thanks again for the good word.

Happy Thanksgiving.
