Subject: Thanksgiving, and buses

As my family and I sat down to yet another Thanksgiving Dinner that couldn't 
be beat with the traditional Alice's Resteraunt playing (bus content) I got 
to thinking.  What about Officer Obie...

None of that saga could have taken place without him.  I did a search and 
yes, there was such a person and he's more famous than you may think.  Check 
out:

While you're at it, accept my thanks for all of you in the last years.
