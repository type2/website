Subject: Starter/Bolt

How do you locate and hold the nut on the top bolt of a defective starter,
it's a '78 Microbus. The starter is held by a bolt at the top and a stud
and nut at the bottom. The bolt head is not hexagonal, it is circular with
a flat part of the head which engages in a recess in the starter mounting
frame. Access to the nut on the engine side is between the fan housing and
the bulkhead in the engine compartment? How do you get to it? Do you have
to take off any tin? Can't seem to identify it from the engine side.

Thanks for the help,
Jack
