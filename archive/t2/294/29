Check that the engine turns over by hand at the crankshaft pulley,,, if you have
a seized engine, the starter will not spin the engine!

Other wise,, check your ground strap,, I always recommend installing a booster
cable from the battery ground to the starter body, or the engine case, as a
temporary test to see if the ground has gone bad.

Next, pull the starter..... 

Hope that helps
