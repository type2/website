Seeing that you don't live in the SW desert, I'd recommend you save your
money for a carport.  Unless you are where there is zero moisture, car covers
will rot off--ask me how I know. 8o(

If they do not breathe (and rot), then they will trap moisture inside, that 
will rust
and rot your bus--probably will even if it breathes.

Living in a temperate climate, with over 50 inches of annual rainfall has 
taught me
a thing or two about how to keep things dry.  You need to cover your bus with
something that allows air circulation underneath--like a carport.  Those 
poles and fabric
"instant" thingees you can buy at Costco(tm), etc. may look nicer than a 
blue tarp
and plastic pipe hovel, but cost nearly as much as it cost me to build a 
four car carport
with posts and beams and a metal roof.
