Subject: RE: From east to west , and back

Going aircooled? Going in the summer? Best to keep some altitude whenever
possible so temps are a little more moderate. 

You should certainly come and go via different routes, so you can see twice
as much. 

I'll suggest one: head for southern colorado and take a route less
travelled: 

Take I 40 west to Tucumcari NM, then 140 and 518 to Taos. Then head north to
Ft. Garland CO, and turn west on 160 through Durango, Cortez, to Flagstaff.
Then go south on 89a to Wickenberg, pick up 60 west to join I 10, and head
on into SoCal. 

One recommended detour from 160 at Cortez CO:
Heading south out of town, turn right onto McElmo Canyon Rd just before the
airport. Take it west about 20 miles to the Utah border, stop at the
extremely authentic trading post, and then head to Montezuma Creek where you
pick up 163 southeast through Monument Valley until you rejoin 160 at
Kayenta AZ and continue on to Flagstaff. 

Have fun
