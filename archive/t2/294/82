Subject: 000 091 232 Winter Air-Intake Covers, thoughts?...

Any one familiar with the Air Intake Covers for cold weather and/or climates? 
They are little removable covers for 73-79 busses, and they have a very small 
intake, leaving most of the vent closed off.

Looks pretty cool, even for novelty sake. I wonder if this would be a poor 
mans fix for those with removed thermo flaps, and for possibly helping to aid 
warmer air into the blower for the heat.

Any thoughts or comments?
