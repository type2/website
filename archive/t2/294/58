I generally access this bolt from the top.
open engine compartment access hatch.
remove air cleaner.
get open end metric wrench 
get needle nose pliers
crawl under bus
push bolt all the way thru
lay on rear deck with head thru engine hatch, works better feet towards
                                   windshield
next to fuel presure regulator is (should be) bolt sticking out.
hold out with needle nose pliers near base
put on nut, screw down hand tight
while pulling out with pliers tighten with wrench
