DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!

I was visiting in the area, so I drove about 45 minutes to get to the place.

Yes, there is a lot of stuff there...........many vanagons and old buses/
beetles...probably 100-150 cars in all.

The problem is that the fellow that owns the place just flat out does not
feel like helping.  I asked about 4 or 5 different parts........each one the
reply was "those parts probably rusted off up here in
Ohio".................I asked if i could scrounge around, and naturally that
was a no-no...........I asked for a seat out of a 76 bus.....he showed me
one, and wanted 470 for it....well, since I paid $150 for the WHOLE BUS,
could not see doing that..................

It appears that he mainly restores late vanagons now, he had several in
various states of repair present.  BUT, AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID,     DO NOT
EVEN BOTHER TO STOP.
