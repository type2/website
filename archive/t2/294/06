Jamie,

They usual suspects.

Bad battery, bad battery cables, bad ground connection on battery cable,
bad trans strap ground connection, bad positive or ground connection
on the starter, and last, but not least, a bad starter or engine locked 
up!

Clean all connections and retry.....I am assuming that when you say 

 Spark, spark, spark.

it means that the starter didn't turn the engine over.

Cheers, dave
