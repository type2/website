Subject: Seat Install

Hi All,

Over the holiday weekend, I acquired a set of front seats with fold down arm
rests for my 1971 Westy.

The seats apparently came out of a more recent Vanagon. The tracks are not
compatible.

It occurred to me that somebody on this list has probably installed seats
like this, so before I invent my own solution I thought I would ask - what's
the best way to install these seats? They do not need to slide
forward/backward, just be stable.

Thanks for any advice,

Pete
