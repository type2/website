Subject: Re: [T2] 12 Volt Converter and more

I am interested in this westfalia power converter
settup. Was this settup used with busses that had 2
batteries? When pluged in, will it charge both
batteries or just the accessory battery? Can you
monitor both batteries with it?  If it is just made to
charge the accessory battery, will the relay trickle
charge system that is used on many bays be effected? 
These are just a few things that were bouncing around
my head. Thanks for any help that you can give. Have a
happy holiday season!!!
