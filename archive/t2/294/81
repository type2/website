thanks everyone! what was confusing about the lens was that WCM was
calling it a "reflector" not a lens, so i thought it was a separate unit
to be used instead of the light housing. after brousing bus depot, i came
to this same conclusion. also, WCM listed the "bulb holder" as starting
in 71, not 70, so i was a little confused about that.

as far as the tabs that hold it to the body... thanks for the tips,
guys... now that i know this, i can save that one instead of replacing
it.

thanks again everyone!

70 westy (with a REALLY big wish list now)
