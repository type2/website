Subject: Clutch Compatability Question

like you have the wrong clutch and pressure plate.

When I mated my 78 091 (5 ribs) trans up with my 1800 74 motor, I used the
74 flywheel and clutch (the one you probably have), but I changed the
transmission
bellhousing back to the 74 002 style so it would accept the 74 starter and
so the smaller flywheel/clutch would have the appropriate sized bellhousing
to sit inside.
For you it may be a matter of switching up to the 2 liter flywheel/clutch as
the bellhousing may be expecting a larger diameter.
