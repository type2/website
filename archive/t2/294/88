Subject: full flow filter problems; again

I have completed the assembly of a new Berg engine  and, prior to 
actual  startup, I am cranking it on a test stand trying to get oil 
to circulate through the full flow filter attachment. This is my 
first experience with  such an  add-on.

After extensive "priming", I can get oil to spurt out of the oil pump 
cover and down the flexible line to the input port on the filter 
housing.  I filled the filter full of oil, but can not get a drop of 
oil to flow at the output of the housing. It is as though the pump is 
too weak to push the oil through the filter.

Has anyone had this difficulty? Any recommendations for a solution?
