I was faced with a similar problem when I got rear ended in my old 13
window. I had a wad of money in the motor, trans, and front end but it was
an original paint bus and in NC most of it's life(sitting in the woods for a
good portion of it) so it had severe rocker rust and a little floor rust to
go with it. all the pop outs where rusty etc. I got rear ended while turning
into a drive way. the guy never even hit the brakes and the force of the
collision turned the bus over and twisted the enitre body out of whack.
Luckily I wasn't injured at all(second bus roll over with no injury) The
insurance company was firm on $1200 for a week untill one day I said the
magic words "My back is starting to hurt, I think I'm gonna go to the doctor
after all", next thing you know a check to cover my investment in the bus
was in the mail and the case was settled. They easily settled for more than
twice what they offered just to avoid having to play their own game.
Best part was I got to keep the bus and transfered the motor etc. to the
next bus I bought, which wasn't rusty.
