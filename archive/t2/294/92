Hello, I have been trying to locate a painted bus to use in an ad for a 
non-profit theater groups advirtisment of their upcoming show GROOVY, loosly 
based on Woodstock. We would just like to place our actors dressed as 
hippies, flower children etc. in front of and around the bus to take photos 
to place in the newspaper to encourage families to buy tickets to the show in 
April. Do you have any leads for me to follow to help me locate a willing 
owner? We are in Covina CA. LindaStagworks(-at-)aol.com.
Thanks so much, Linda
