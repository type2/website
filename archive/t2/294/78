Subject: rear side marker

i am a little confused... ok, so that's nothing new... anyway, here's the
situation:

WCM	part #		description
71-79	211-351A	bulb holder, rear side marker
70-74	211-363A-L/R	reflector, red rear side marker, silver frame

my bus is a 70 westy, it has wires running to the rear side marker, so do
i get 211-351A? if so, why would my 70 have a 71 part? this part doesnt
appear to have a lense over it, so do i get 211-363A L/R to cover it? it
has it's own frame...

what is confusing me the most is the overlap of years on this part...
which one would be right? i lost one, and the other is loose (it just
pushes into the body, not real secure), so i am trying to find a
replacement (making a wish-list), just wondering what i am supposed to
get!

thanks guys!

70 westy (with a LONG wish list already)
