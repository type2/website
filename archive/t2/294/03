Subject: Won't Start

Hi Folks,
The blasted bus won't start and I can't find any of my manuals amongst the 
renovation of our house.  Here the scenario.  I turn the key and get 
nothing ( click or clunk).  I go back and bang the starter with a 
hammer.  Nada.  I hook up a wire to the starter to bypass the ignition and 
touch the battery.  Spark, spark, spark.  What could be the problem? Thanks

Joy Thru Air,
