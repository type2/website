Subject: A couple of holiday queries ... 

#1: Eberspacher BN-4. The dash switch has a lot more spade connectors than
most--9 in a wiring wiring harness and two others. It's genuine VW and has a
part number
beginning with 411. Most of the extra connectors seem to be variable
resistors controlled by turning the knob. Do they connect to fans? To some
sort of external thermostats? Is anyone familiar with this switch and how
these extra connections are to be used? BTW the wind-up spring timer works
perfectly.

Query #2. Looking at a 12volt original refrigerator to go behind the
passenger seat in my 70 westy and replace the ice box/sink combo. How long
will it run on a fully charged auxilliary battery? Does anyone know the
amperage draw or what size converter is needed to run off shore power? Does
it get cold enough to make ice?

Botttom line: Is this a dumb idea and I should just stick with ice, Or what?

Many thanks,

John Rogers
