Great looking rotisserie Tom, very simple but effective design.  Did you
make it? 

Here is one way of getting the bus up in the air for mounting it to the
rotisserie, this is a portable hoist I use to pick up busses with frozen
drums or missing trannies.  Just pick them up and back the trailer under
them.  Takes about 15 minutes to set up.
