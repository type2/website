Subject: Re: [T2] removing equipment

I am not sure about the bolt that secure the sink cabinet to the fridge one
but could be located beside the water pump that is behind a piece of wood in
the compartment bellow the water reservoir, I think it is a 10 mm bolt with
a big washer, I am not sure if you have to remove the grill at the bottom of
the fridge to get access to the bolt, there are just two Philips screws.

Greetings

Roberto
