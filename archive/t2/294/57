Subject: RE: Air dam, ground effects kit for type 2.

Hi Jack,

The contact details for the company which makes the ones I have on my bus
(also the grp spare wheel cover) is

Elite Vehicles
29 Green Hill Drive
Leeds
United Kingdom
LS13 4JZ

phone/fax +44 113 263 7900

Sorry no e-mail details.

For those who may "fancy" a spoiler and side skirts on their T2 they may be
seen on my T2 at
www.wallace.bob.btinternet.co.uk/type2/html/newbus/19990417.htm and these
are my experiences of using them on my VW T2s.

The spoiler has a positive effect on the front end of the bus, as the
partial vacuum it creates provides extra down force, giving a less "floaty"
feeling when cornering. Also helps with stability in crosswinds.

The side skirts are a help in steady crosswinds as they do (marginally)
increase the vacuum under the bus and therefore the down force; but no one
should think these are magic bullets that will make a T2 rock solid in windy
conditions.

A bigger increase in stability can be expected by ensuring that your
steering linkages are in good condition. Up rated anti roll bars help too,
but the most marked increase in stability will be found by moving to a tyre
with stiffer side walls - even on a bus with spoiler, side skirts and up
rated roll bars there was a massive difference in moving from 4 ply to 8 ply
tyres [when I had my first T2 I didn't know 4 ply were wrong but the tyre
shop that sold them to me should have known...].

Yes the front spoiler is a good addition to the road holding ability of a T2
but the side skirts are really an "if you like it" addition. Expect to
scrape the spoiler on rough ground or on a sudden change from down hill to
flat too.

Good luck

Hey Bob,

I am looking for an airdam and maybe the side kit for my 76 type 2. Do you
have any idea where I might be able to get my hands on one, new, used, or
even messed up? I had one on my old van, and it got destroyed in a crash.

Thanks a bunch.

Jack
