It sounds like you have the '75 tranny.  I always thought it was one-year-only but maybe it came in some late '74's also.  Look at the number on the side of the tranny - you need to find out whether it begins with "091" or "002".  The 091 should actually have six ribs, not five.

Obviously not the original, so the tranny is also suspect.

If you have the 002 tranny (likely), then the 215mm clutch is the correct size.  If you have the 091 tranny, then you need to determine which bellhousing you have.  The later bellhousing is thicker and takes a different starter and the 227mm clutch.  You say your starter is a type D but I am not familiar with that term so I can't conclude anything from it.
