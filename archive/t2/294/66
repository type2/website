Subject: knobs, knobs, and more knobs

I'm going to be installing some fog lights on my westie this weekend since
for the past three weeks I've been able to barely see in the morning, and of
course it comes back before I head home from work.
Are there any manufacturers out there that make switches that look like the
original knobs on my 77 dash?  The lights came with a lighted rocker switch,
but I want to "blend it in" on the dash.
