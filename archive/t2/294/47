Subject: removing equipment

I also have been wondering how to remove a piece of equipment.  The rear
drivers window in my Riveria is covered by a piece of wood, that is only
held in by two screws...but is behind the cabinet.  Is there an easy way for
me to get this out???  I want to mount a piece of art over the wood, then
reinstall it.
