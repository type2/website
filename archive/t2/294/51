Subject: Reminder: Holiday Bus Fest

December 7th, a week from tomorrow, the seventh annual ( or is its eighth, I
can't remember) Mid Atlantic Holiday Bus Fest, 1:30 to 5:30 pm. 

At the home of Michele Moriarty and Tom Forhan:
7001 Westmoreland Ave. 
Takoma Park MD 20912
301 270 8073
(just north of Wash DC, inside Beltway - use mapquest)

This not just about buses, bring your significant other/kids, whomever.

 Last year an NPR reporter crashed the event and we ended up with a national
news story about bus culture. Whatever happens this time, it will be fun! 

If you think you are coming let us know so we can vaguely guage numbers, but
if you want to decide at the last minute, just drop in!

Bring something to share, and we will see you there!
