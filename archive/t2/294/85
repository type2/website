Subject: Fuel pump (was Post-Thanksgiving blues..)

When the engine cranked but didn't start, I did some tests.

The ignition looks okay : the wire from the coil sparks to ground, and
the other wires did the same with a grounded spark plug.

The fuel pump relay clicks when the key is switched to ON. I checked
the fuel pump voltage when cranking and it was 10.5V. Presumably
(correct me if I'm wrong) the lower voltage is due to the starter
motor.

I connected a long tube to the outlet of the fuel pump and had my wife
turn the key this morning. No fuel from the pump. So the fuel pump is
probably bad.

It is normal for the fuel pump (which looks like the original 20year
old unit) to die a sudden death like this? Before I pulled the old
engine, the van would always start up.
