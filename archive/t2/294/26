Subject: Shift lever lock

Hello guys

Are there somebody out there who knows how to install a Anti theft shift lock,
the kind that goes at the bottom of the shift lever.
I got one for a friend but I do not know how to open it to install it, also
has some electrical connection inside (spade type) that I do not know how to
use them neither.
It has a VW logo on the side, a screw in the back that appear to be for
control the shit lever motion that is all I can said.

Thanks from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela


Roberto
