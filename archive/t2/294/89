Just dealt with this the day before yesterday, as a matter of fact.  8o)

Pull the spark plugs, and the black wire off the + terminal of the coil 
(tape up).
Loosen the connection of the hose coming from the oil pump cover to the
filter AT THE FILTER END, so that air can escape.  Using a remote starter
(or helpful assistant at the ignition switch), crank until oil starts to 
come out
of the connection, then tighten it up.  Resume cranking until the oil light 
goes
out.  Install spark plugs and reconnect power to coil.  Unless your battery
is really new and strong, I'd recommend running a battery charger while
you're cranking.
