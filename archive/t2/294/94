Comes with our vehicles' place on the food chain. Corvairs and Fiats are 
exactly the same.

I've seen folks that buy a basket case that they thought was just great and 
then park them 3 months later in the back yard because they realized they 
can't afford the repairs ($1000+) that they were not diligent enough to 
notice before they bought the vehicle. The van sits there rusting away 
until they get tired of looking at it and just dump it - unfortunately it's 
a rust bucket not worth fixing. I got a couple this way for parts.

Funny how alot of folks buy vehicles to restore and then realize that they 
don't have the time, tools, budget or motivation to do the dirty and hot 
(or cold) work involved.
