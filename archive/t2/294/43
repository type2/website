Subject: removing camper equipment - 76

Heya fellow listmembers...

I am trying to get the camper equipement out of my 76, but cannot figure
out how it comes out. 

Question - is the icebox unit connected to the sink unit somehow? 

I got the screws that connect the sink to the back of the drivers chair,
removed the fresh water tank, removed the screw holding the lower left
to the floor, but it seems like something is holding it to the icebox
still. 

Any advice welcome!

Christopher
