Subject: Type 1 engine thermostat location

I wrote this up in my blog when I did the thermostat in my van which has a
1600 engine. There is a photo of the device itself so you can see the
bracket and location. The picture is taken from the back of the bus.

Hope this helps

Where is the thermostat located on a type 1 engine??  I see so many beetles
in this yard that I am sure some of them should still have the thermostat on
them.
