I think it's pretty funny too, today.  It was kinda scary when I pulled into the driveway and saw it.  One thing I didn't mention, the POR products were in 2 cheap plastic spray bottles instead of the metal cans they came in.  It could be that they were too thin to take heat and melted.  KR

  Sorta Type2 related. I'm smoking the turkey in my gas smoker. On the table next to it is sitting POR-15 prep products. Metal Ready and I don't remember the name of the other one. And a couple of oven mitts and a propane grill lighter. It's running along at 300F. I go to the store, come back, and the table is on fire. What would have ignited first? Is the POR-15 stuff that flamable?? Probably it was the lighter which was right underneath the cloth mitts. But it was a nice fire. Just glad it didn't interfere with the great looking and smelling turkey that we'll enjoy tomorrow. But that POR-15 stuff is not cheap! I'm just glad I didn't have the $30 POR-15 can sitting there. It was inside the house. And I'm glad the house is brick. Whew...KR
