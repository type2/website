On my way to work this morning in my Syncro, heavy traffic, wet
pavement, looked to my right and saw a gray-bearded guy in a Bay window.
I waved, he waved back.  Traffic very heavy so I couldn't get a good
look at his Bay.  Anyway, a fun sighting on a Monday morning.  Location
was I-580 westbound at 238 interchange, Castro Valley, California.
