Subject: Re: [T2] side dooor guide replacement

not sure how to name it but on the rear support for the sliding door there
is a roller and a nylonlike block that supports and guides the door in the
track.

the nyloon block often breaks, I have been trying to make replacement
blocks from various materiels but have not been very successful. I am
wondering what other volks experiences are.  do any of the dealers sell a
resonable replacement even.  I just replaced my sliding door with a nice
refurbished used one.  looks real pretty took about 2 hours to put the new
door on, and a week later I'm still trying to get it adjusted "right" so
that it opens and closes and locks etc smoothly.  the rear slider just is
not wanting to adjust to lock back there easily,  I'm sure there are some
tricks but since this is my first door relpacement I'm learning em all the
hard way .... boy is that door heavy too.
