Subject: 1971 Wheel studs/bolts

Can the good folks on the list give me the data on the (14mm) wheel 
studs/bolts that are stock on a VW bus of that or later years ?

I want to add some bigger rims (been reading Ratwell, and going from that 
data) but with the wheels, and possible spacers, I will need longer bolts 
pressed in.

From what I can remember, they are the same as Porsche, and most Porsche 
parts dealers stock them in different lengths.

BUT STILL NEED THE DATA.
