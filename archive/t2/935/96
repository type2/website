Subject: cheap parts

Hey, guys.  If there's anyone in the vicinity of Chattanooga, Jim Lockhart VW is going out of business this week after 30 or so years.  Some developer wanted his property so he's going to retire early.  He's got a lot of VW stuff he's selling for $1 apiece.  He gave me a set of hubcaps (he has plenty more) and a new(er) engine compartment door.  But another local VW guru was down there packing a bunch of stuff in his van.  He beat me to a couple of BN-4's.  But if you dig, you might find something you could use.  And like I said, he's got lots of bug parts left.  I couldn't find another 091 tranny but he had a bunch of others.  He has to be out Friday and the scrap guys are already loading up.  Cheers...KR
