Subject: My Photos

I just became aware that a number of my photos were
not accessible to the general public. When I added new
ones I failed to designate them as "public." They were
there when I looked though!

Hopefully all is fixed now and trie siping and some
new Subey photos are there. NEW Link is in my
signature below.
