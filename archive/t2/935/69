Subject: Insulating a 68-79 westy pop-top

Hi Volks,

Has anyone here successfully insulated the inside of a baywindow pop- 
top?  I recently slept upstairs in my parents 1985 westy and the  
interior flocking did a great job of preventing the dew from falling  
inside the van even though there were 4 adults sleeping inside. I'd  
like to explore a similar treatment for my 1974 roof in the westfakia.

I know that the vanagon top is susceptible to mildew.. Perhaps a  
closed-cell foam might work?

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
