Hi,

Follow up. Pulled the two new switches, put back in the two old
switches, prefilled with brake fluid. Result: The brake warning light
is still on. Next step, check connectors to brake switches. Perhaps a
wire/connector broke during the replacement procedure? Brakes still
work great, thankfully.
