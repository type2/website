I'm sure he does have some NOS stuff.  But you'd just have to pick through it to find out.  Lots more bug stuff than bus left.  I don't know that it would be worth a long trip.  You can call and ask him what he might have that you want.  423-266-0511.  If he says he has something you want, I'd be glad to pick it up for you and hold it or ship it to you.  Good luck...KR

Was this a dealership or a VW shop?

Does he have NOS stuff, Type 4 stuff? Where is he located?
