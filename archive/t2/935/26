It's above the tin just inboard of the right heater box and is visible
with a flashlight without removing anything.  To remove you take out a
piece of tin (four screws), the nut on the end of the bracket, and unscrew
the thermostat from the pushrod.

Look first, as I find very few bugs with the bellows in place.  Usually an
empty bracket.

The temperature is stamped on the end of the thermostat, IIRC.
