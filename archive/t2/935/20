Keep in mind that different year busses have things that may or may
not interfere with the new wheels. Not just offset.

For example: you know those 2 little bolts on the face of your drums?
They interfere with the 14" alloys I have. So when I put those guys on
I have to remove those bolts. The shape of the stock steelies make
them a non-issue.
