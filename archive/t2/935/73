It didn't work as well as we'd hoped. I think the foil was wicking  
the heat away from the canvas.  I wound up dropping the roof at about  
4AM to conserve the heat. OTOH, Dad had the same foil used on his bus  
and he stayed warm... the main difference is that there were more  
people sleeping in his van.

This time around I am thinking that insulating the inside of the bus  
would keep the heat closer to me. I am also working on styrofoam  
insulation for the interior of the windows to keep them from frosting  
up and cooling the interior.

BTW, Frank condelli has created a fabric-based insulation for a westy  
much along the lines of what I pictured above, he published the plans  
and pics of his final product here:
