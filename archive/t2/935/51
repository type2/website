Subject: BA-6 exhaust outlet diameter

Hey folks, going take the plunge and get the BA6 up running again. Exhaust
pipe has long ago fallen to bits. I need to know the exhaust outlet diameter
in order to fab one from some flexible pipe or?? If someone has one handy to
give me the outside diameter I'll know what size pipe to buy to fit over it.
Thanks,
Courtney
