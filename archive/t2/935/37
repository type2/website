Craig,

I am not 100% sure I understand your question (the +/- one inch thing is
throwing me a bit) but the pilot bearing is flush with the front (flywheel
end) of the crankshaft. In other words, if you remove the flywheel from the
crank, the pilot bearing is right there, flush with that surface with the 5
holes.
