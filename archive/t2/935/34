I think this is the case in my situation, or one (or both) of the
switches is malfunctioning. I've bled the entire system again,
including the brake regulator (how come no one ever mentions bleeding
there??) and the light is still on.

Exactly why I decided to replace mine. I didn't have to press quite
that hard but I noticed that when I let my foot up just a tad while
stopped at traffic lights that my brake lights would go off. Last
thing I want is someone rear-ending me for lack of function on a $6
switch. With the current switches the brake lights go on with just a
touch on the pedal - which is nice.

Odd that the brake light function of both the switches is working
correctly - even with the possibility of air trapped in them - yet the
brake warning functionality is just not right. I guess each of those
switches probably contains 2 switches internally and who knows where
that air bubble is trapped exactly.

I will try bleeding the switches next, couldn't hurt to try, before
putting the old switches back in. I'm getting tired of bleeding and
I've already gone through 2 "tall boys" of synthetic brake fluid. At
least I know I've replaced all the fluid in the system with nice clean
high-temp stuff.
