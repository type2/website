the larger studs use m10 x 1.5 nuts. you won't likely find an exact  
replacement at any hardware store, they are small across the flats -  
15mm instead of the normal 17mm - and they are about 3mm taller than  
a normal m10 nut. type 4 engines use the same size head nuts as the  
early  10mm head-stud upright engines.
