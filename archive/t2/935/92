And if the Voltage Regulator does not blow right away, the Diode Rectifier
Pack in the alternator that turns AC to DC will certainly become damaged or
totally burn out.  It's a very common occurrence when the battery cable
becomes disconnected on alternator charging systems, regardless if it's a
Cheby or VW.
