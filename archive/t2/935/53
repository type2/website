Subject: Re: [T2] emissions

One of these days I probably won't even be able to drive through Cali.  But I'm tickled to be legit over here.  I guess CA standards would require a major overhaul. I've got a 2.0 engine to rebuild.  And I've thought seriously about putting in a Megasquirt system when I do.  Would that even be considered a legitimate modification in Cali?  (concerning the visual inspection) I'm sure I'd have to put all of the original emissions stuff back on it.  I'm expecting the emissions requirements to get even more strict as time goes by but our vehicles will probably still be grandfathered to where they are.  But I don't know about in CA!  Cheers...KR

Beyond the visual inspection these are the current passing limits:

In CA you would have failed the tail pipe test.
