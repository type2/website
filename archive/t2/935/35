Subject: Pilot bearing

Hello all,

 I'm attempting once again to get my clutch to work. After dropping the engine
on my 1981 Vanagon to change a head I also put in a new pilot bearing, seal and
throwout bearing. I left the clutch disk and pressure plate as is since they
were just 30 K miles on them. Other attempt to fix this include master clutch
cylinder replacement, bleeding of the line, and different throwout bearing. May
need to re-bleed the system.     My question at this point in time is:  How far
does the pilot bearing need to be seated?

  I can't remember how it was when I pulled it. I installed it  about a year
ago. CRS syndrome I guess. Currently there is about an inch -/+ gap between the
crankshaft and the back end of the bearing.

 Thank you -- any suggestions deeply appreciated while I'll get this van running
  Craig
