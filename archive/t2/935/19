Make it simple, please?

If someone has a bus which takes "stock" 14-inch wheels, what 15-inch  
wheels will fit, either with or without (and PLEASE specify!) adapters!

I think this is what the masses want to know.

(At least, I do)

Or does this thread alread exist, and I have made a complete arse of  
myself?

(Wouldn't be the first time, thank you.)
