the front are rear are different parts. rear is 34.5mm long, front is  
45.5mm long. both are m14 x 1.5.

there are some longer porsche studs that will work, but nothing i  
have seen has a long enough spline to work perfectly for the front.  
the front hubs are very thick and need a spline that is extra-long,  
about 15mm, and the porsche studs have about 10mm of spline.

911 331 671 00 is 66mm long and is probably long enough for the front  
most alloy wheels.  the good thing about the porsche studs is that  
they have a nice fine spline like the originals, in fact they are  
nearly identical to the OG studs, and made by the same mfg. - verbus.
