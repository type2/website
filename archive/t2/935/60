I love the snow. Having a bus makes it even better. It's awesome in
the snow. Especially with the Nokians. My last snow experience was 2
years in Big Bear with an old 71 Ford LTD. Talk about the worst snow
car ever...

A Megasquirt isn't legal, since it doesn't have CARB certification.
But unless you have big orange arrows pointing to the MS box, I doubt
an average smog tech would even notice.

"Fuel injection? Yep." That's all they'd say.
