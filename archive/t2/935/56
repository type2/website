Well, I definitely won't be moving to CO.  Unless somebody offers me a six-figure job.  (I'm not holding my breath)  I'm getting too old for the snow, ice, and cold.  But what a great state to visit!  Don, I still don't see how you could've adapted to the climate shock coming from Southern Cal.  But after spending the last five winters in tropical climates, I'm having to get used to cold weather again myself.  But nothing like you, brother.  (I know you Canooks think we're a bunch of wimps down here when it comes to cold weather.  To that I say you're right.  But then ignorance is bliss.)  Brrr...KR

CO too... Though I don't recall if they really looked at my engine or not.
