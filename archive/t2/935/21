Subject: Re: [T2] Re: '71 Brake Warning Light

The switches get air bubbles in them and the bubbles
cannot escape. Sometimes you can loosen the switch and
bleed it in that fashion, but often not. Some pre-fill
the switch. From a highly reliable source when I
bought my new MC a few years back - if the old
switches work, use them. The new ones are very poor
and not reliable. As with anything, there are
different manufacturers I'm sure... Mine got so that I
had to push so hard on the pedal to get the
brakelights to come on, I'd darn near have tp lock the
wheels up! I added a mechanical switch activated by
the brake pedal arm. They're about $8 at FLAPS. Stlii
has not addressed imbalance or possible imbalance in
your system, but if it stops straight, what more do
you need (except for the damned light to go off!) -BaH
