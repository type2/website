Subject: Correct 15" MB or Audi rims for acceptable offset

I have read ratwells comments and the type2 tire/rim info, but there are a large no. of rims listed for the Mercedes and Audi. Can anyone tell me which car rims from which EXACT year and  model they're using in order to run 15" wheels on a bay? The tire selection is SO much better in 15".
Thanks,
Courtney
