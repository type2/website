Nope.. but that didn't stop me from passing smog brilliantly.. and I 
found out later that my EGR wasn't working either..

While the technician didn't notice my wires, I was thinking about 
gutting out an old ECU and then running all the EFI connections through 
there.  It would look completely stock except for the TPS and intake air 
temp sensor.  But that could be hidden nicely, as well ;)

but regardless, the combination of the MS and a WB02 is a god sent!
