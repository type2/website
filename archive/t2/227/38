Subject: Re: [T2] removal of heads

Michelle-
Valve stem seals are installed during cylinder head rebuilding.
These go on the valve stem under the valve spring, and require
disassembly of the valve hardware with the cylinder head removed..
It is unlikely you need these unless you are planning the head rebuild.

It is more likely you meant to replace push rod tube o-rings at
the cylinder heads and at the case, a normal maintenance item.
These can be easily replaced without removing the cylinder head ( Type 4 ).
Release the bail on a valve cover and take the cover off for a quick look.
The tubes remove from the head after you have unbolted the rocker hardware.
Make a note of how the long bent wire spring is fitted to the push rod tubes.
( Type 1 push rod tube seals require the cylinder heads to be removed.)
