where are you located and what mechanical shape do you need? does it have
to be running or are you willing to work on that if you get a bus in good
physical shape? there is one here in tulsa, ok (not running but the body
looks great so far, $595) and i have a friend who finds VWs all the time.
let us know where you are and how far you are willing to go to find a
bus...
