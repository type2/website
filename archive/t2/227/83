What is the recommended replacement interval for the gas pedal hinge?  I've 
seen a few people on this list with broken ones and it left them 
more-or-less stranded, unless they McGyvered up something to get them home.

You will always be able to find an example here or there of a newer vehicle 
that fails.  My argument is that the 0-3 year old Saturn would still be 
more reliable in the long run than an old bus, even one that's properly 
maintained.  My wife bought a '96 Saturn new, and we just sold it a few 
months ago with 100k miles on it.  It never once left her stranded.

My '73 camper is a 30-year-old vehicle, things go wrong simply from old 
age.  That's not a problem for me, and it's not even a problem for my wife, 
because she knows I can fix most things that would leave us stranded (bless 
her heart) but I would never fault anyone for wanting to drive something 
more reliable than a bus.  I can't even recommend with a clear conscience 
that my mom buy an older bus - she does NOT need to be worrying about 
mechanical problems.  I'm trying to get her into a newer Eurovan Westy.
