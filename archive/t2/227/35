I had the same thing in my bus, after some research I found that it was
connected to the fuse box in a location called the "Aux Heater Circuit."
(even though it wasn't connected to my BN4) I think I found this out via the
Bentley or Haynes manual...  I removed the wire from the spade connector on
the back of the fuse box and just took it out of my bus.
