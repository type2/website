Subject: jalousies?

Hi Volks,
Anyone have a pair of jalousies that they wish to unload in the MD, VA, DC 
area?  I'm converting my '71 Deluxe into a camper for the family.  I have a 
full length z-bed for my wife and I, child's cot for the 2 year old, and 
the rear end tent for my 6 year old, plus a side tent for our stuff.  Any 
help would be appreciated.

Joy Thru Air,
