Subject: Espar Gas Heaters, how many BTU's is enough? Group purchase?

I finally got a price on the Espar heaters as possible 
replacements for my BA6.

I am pretty sure the BA6 puts out 12,000 or 15,000 BTU's but 
I was trying to decide if that was overkill for the van. 
Which one should I get?

The B1LC costs $1545 CAD puts out 7,500 BTU's using .07 US 
gallons per hour drawing 2.5 amps.

The B3LC costs $1945 CAD puts out 12,000 BTU's using .11 US 
gallons per hour drawing 3.0 amps.

Is the greater BTU's worth the $400 Canadian price difference?
BTW, If I can get 3 heaters I can get $150 CAD off the price 
if anyone is interested...

Thanks,
Chris
