I found my father-in-law a Buick that had been a small town local car with 
low miles. As soon as he got it to Chattanooga and put it into daily 
service at interstate speeds it developed a rash of minor problems like 
water pumps, hoses, brakes, etc.

The car only had 75K miles on it.

Took a while to get past those trips to the local mechanic and then all was 
well.

He got the itch after a year or two for a p/u so he bought a used p/u and 
sold the Buick.

This is the type of problems I would expect from one of those VW Westies 
that has 14K miles on it and is selling for $15K.
