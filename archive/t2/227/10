Subject: Voltage drop, temperature rise

I have newly installed VDO gages on my dash. I have noticed that the voltage
reading is just below 14V during normal operation, but drops to a hair below
12V when the headlights are turned on. Does this indicate that something is
operating incorrectly or wired incorrectly? Also, my engine temperature
reading goes up about 20 degrees when the headlights are turned on and drops
when the lights are turned off again.
