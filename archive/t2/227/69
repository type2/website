This seems totally obvious, I'm sorry to say.

There are other factors to consider: was it garaged, what is the climate
like where it sat. Was it properly stored according to generally acceptable
car storage practices. ;-)  An don't forget, proper maintenance according to
the mileage.

There was a discussion a while back about the $11-16k Westies.  Super mint
condition.  It was generally agreed that everything in these was too
original and there would be another $2,000 to short term repairs for the new
buyer.

IMHO, for the average owner it's better not to inherit the original brakes,
rotors, cv boots, gas tank, fuel lines, paint, etc.

All this said, there are some rare gems out there of course.
