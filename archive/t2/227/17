I personally would be scared to use detergent oil in an engine that has been
using non-detergent for a long time.

Some people have had good luck using motor flushes, others have ruined
otherwise perfectly good motors.

My advice is just to stock up on non-detergent and run that until you need
to tear down your engine. After your rebuild, you can switch to detergent if
you like.

If the engine is in good shape and looks like its going to be with you for a
while, you should consider installing an oil filter. I'm partial to the old
style bypass type filters, but the masses like full flow filters. In either
case, this will help increase the life of your current engine.
