Subject: Re: [T2] few questions RE: 70 westy

>>i just bought my first vw bus, a 70 westy, last week.

awesome, what shape is she in? I got my first bus in May.


>>my first question is what type of oil to use?

I use Castol 30HD, many different opionions on this question.


>>i shift into 2nd (-at-) 10-15 mph, 3 (-at-) 27-30 mph, 4 (-at-) 45 mph.

I tend to rev pretty high before shifting, that's alot easier on the engine 
than if you shift it and lug the engine and it's under rev'd. You'll get 
used to your bus and just feel when it's time to shift, just never lug the 
engine.
