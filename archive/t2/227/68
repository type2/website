The Riviera is IMHO a bit poor in the floor space arrangement. Thanks to 
the ice box right next to the sliding door you can't carry much but people. 
It is the first thing that would come out and live in the garage if I had one.

My biggest pet peeve is that at least on a '78 Riviera you can't reach the 
interior sliding door handle. Bad for emergencies and just bad when you 
don't want to crawl out the front door in the morning.

I prefer the lopsided Westy arrangement. I prefer even more the Marco Polo 
Vito design (as long I get the Mercedes along with the interior components 
- - grin!).

Those slow Corvair vans? Must have been 2 speed power glides. Everybody I 
have talked to said 70 mph in 3rd gear in a Trans-Vair (they have 4 speeds) 
and a couple mpg better to boot.

Only down side I see is a possible significant ground clearance problem 
(IMHO - I like dirt roads).
