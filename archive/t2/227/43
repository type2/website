The first edition patches are all gone.  We have a 2 new patches to =
choose from... 100 of each made, when they are gone they are gone. Our =

Both of these patches were designed by Shawn Bennett a Moonie in San =
Diego, CA... She was the designer of the Let it Grow Patch.  Both Great =
quality and ultra cool patches.  If you check out the mushroom one =
