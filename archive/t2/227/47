Better not drive on it unless you have a cell phone and the number of a tow
truck!!  If it is the CV, they like to lock up.  If it is the swing arm
bearing, the wheel could start to wobble and mess more things up.

This is why it is sooooo important to have CV's and rear wheel bearings
greased the first thing when you buy a bus and then NO MORE than 25,000 on
the CV's and 40,000 on the rear wheel bearings before greasing again.  Any
kind of tears in the boots will shorten the life of the CV's.

I hope this didn't sound like a chewing out, just trying to make the point
that so many people overlook, or just plain don't do.

Like the old mechanic said, "either you can pay me a little now for some
grease, or a LOT later to replace!!!"
