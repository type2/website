Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Cooling question



Born and raised in Sacramento (me). Both my '70 Deluxe, and my long-lost '74 
Love Bug(special edition), BOTH had the thermostat intact when I got them.  
The '74 was purchesed NEW from Snyder(now gone) VW on Auburn Boulevard...Had 
a rebuild done after the '74 threw a rod, and afterward noticed foaming of 
the oil on the inside of the oil-filler cap.  Later figured out the 
thermostathad been unwillingly yanked and tossed, leading to condensation in 
the oil because of the slow warmup.  Not good for the poor thing at all.  
Reinstalled the copper goodie, and solved the problem.  Leave it there.  We 
can survive without an appendix, but that doesn't mean we all need surgery 
to remove them.
