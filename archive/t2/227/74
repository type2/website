An article I read explained that a sliding tire on a smooth surface 
(pavement) actually slides further because the bits and pieces of the tire 
that rub off ball up and cause the tires to slide on little rubber balls - 
- just like an eraser on paper. Slide you finger over a pile of eraser 
debris and see if the friction of your finger against paper doesn't go down.

Sliding is better though at slow speeds on dirt and gravel b/c of the small 
pile of debris that builds up in front of the tire and helps stop the vehicle.

FWIW...
