Funny, I would have argued the exact opposite.  :)  There was a guy in the 
paper the other day with a '92 accord with over a million miles on it, and 
it still drove "like a new car".  Personally, from a reliability standpoint 
I will take a newer, high-mileage vehicle any day over an older, 
low-mileage one.

Suddenly, I agree with you.  :)  But with our busses, it's really not 
important as you either get an old bus with low miles, or an old bus with 
high miles.  And in this case, the old bus with low miles is of course 
preferable.
