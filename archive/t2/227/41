>I have an idea that the oil drips that I am experiencing is a blown rear main seal!!!!! I JUST PUT THE ENGINE IN LAST YEAR!!!!!!!
Is the rear seal a bear to get at?  I probably have to rip the engine down completely, eh?  I think I may have damaged it when
installing the engine last time.  Was I too careless?  Am I experiencing bad Karma?  AM I GOING OUT OF MY MIND?????  At this point,
probably when I'm ready for hauling the engine and doing this, I may as well do an overhaul?

The front seal ( rear main :) does not require engine disassembly.
Remove the flywheel and pry it out. Good time to check endplay.
Fit the seal in dry, but lube the inner sealing surface.Check pilot bearing.
To determine the necessity of an overhaul, verify compression,
oil pressure, mileage, and available cash flow.
