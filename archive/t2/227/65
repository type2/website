ELECTRICAL THEORY...BY JOSEPH LUCAS

Positive ground electrical transmission of energy depends on proper
circuit functioning: ie transmissions of negative ions by
retention of their visible spectral manifestations, known as "smoke."
Smoke is the thing that makes electrical circuits
work. We know this to be true because every time we let the smoke out of
the electrical system, it stops working. This theory
can be proven by repeatable empirical demonstration.

For example, when smoke escapes from an electrical component (e.g. an
Inverse Frasmutable Diode) we will subsequently
observe that the component stops working. The function of a wire harness
is to carry smoke from one device to another.

When a harness springs a leak and lets all the smoke out of the system,
nothing works afterwards. Starter motors were
frowned upon in British automobiles for many years, largely because they
consume large quantities of smoke, requiring very
large wires.

Some have alleged that British components may be more prone to
electrical leakage than generic German or Japanese (or for
that matter American) electrics. Experts point out that this is because
all things British leak. British engines leak oil, British
shock absorbers, hydraulic forks and discbrakes leak hydraulic fluid.
British intelligence leaks secrets. Naturally, British
electrics leak smoke.

By establishing an understanding of these basic concepts of electrical
transmission of energy in the form of smoke, the mysteries
of electrical components will become clearer to the casual user.
