Subject: rear main seal, oil leak

I have an idea that the oil drips that I am experiencing is a blown rear main seal!!!!! I JUST PUT THE ENGINE IN LAST YEAR!!!!!!!  Is the rear seal a bear to get at?  I probably have to rip the engine down completely, eh?  I think I may have damaged it when installing the engine last time.  Was I too careless?  Am I experiencing bad Karma?  AM I GOING OUT OF MY MIND?????  At this point, probably when I'm ready for hauling the engine and doing this, I may as well do an overhaul?  

Tell me what you think!
