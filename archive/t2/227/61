A far as reliability of a bus (or any vehicle for that matter), in my
experience it is the miles on the vehicle, not it's age which is the key
factor. As an example our '73 beetle was bought new by my girl friends Aunt,
and she 'inherited it' when her Aunt could no longer drive in 1990 with 50K
Km on the clock. We have since done a further 100K Km in it only replacing a
few consumable parts (tyres, break pads etc) despite it's 29 years of
service.
All the low mileage vehicles I've had (properly cared for of course) had
given me trouble free miles with minimal repairs, all the high mileage
vehicles I've had have required lots of maintenance and failure of 'non
consumable' parts.
The trick with old vehicles is to find one with GENUINE low miles AND the
original parts.
It's nice to replace the original riveted brake shoes as I did in the
beetle! (I even kept them).
