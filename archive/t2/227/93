Can't say I've had that particular problem.  Sounds like a good application for
"bailing wire" AKA "mechanic's wire,"  I keep a spool in every vehicle.  It 
also
comes in handy (with a butt end crimp on connector and a round terminal) for
fixing broken bug accelerator cables--when they break going into the tube at
the pedal end.  I've had that happen three times in the past eighteen years.

Saturns aren't built for the "long run."  Do you honestly believe that you 
will see any
on the road in thirty years?

My point is that the driver's ability to deal with situations is a part of 
the "reliability" equation.
It's not just the sum of the parts that happen to be connected together at 
the time.

I simply don't believe there IS anything more reliable than a PROPERLY 
MAINTAINED bus
driven by someone with tools, spare parts, and the intent to get there and 
back.

It's my opinion...............that AC VWs are for driver/mechanics ONLY.
Perhaps also those *lucky* enough to find a good Doktor.
LOLs rarely (never?) have what's needed for that sort of thing.  Fortunately,
they rarely drive too far, and so tend not to wear new cars out too much.

.......or any other mommy van.  Frankly, at this stage of the bus'
evolution (devolution?), I see them as nothing more.  F. Porche would
not be pleased.
