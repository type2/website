i need to replace my valve seals and push rod tube seals.  i am wondering if 
i need to lower or remove the engine to remove the heads and also what 
gasket(s) will i need to purchase before i start?  another thing--i was 
reading the article   "Hydraulic Lifters and Type IV Pushrod Tube Seals" by 
John Anderson from the type2 library and i was wondering where i can find the 
Viton seals that he mentioned.  This is what he suggested doing:  "Do the 
same to the bores over on the heads. Install Viton o-rings with silicone 
grease (or at least oil) and those tubes won't leak again."  
one more thing, does anyone know of one supplier that could get us all of the 
above-- the Viton seals, the gaskets needed for the head and valve seals?
any help would be appreciated.  thanks, michelle
