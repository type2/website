Subject: ignition switch question

Listees,
I replaced the electrical portion of my ignition switch tuesday because it 
was getting harder and harder to start.  You'd have to turn the key with 
full force, almost breaking it to get it to crank.  Finally it just gave 
up.  With the new switch in, now it will only crank if you push the key in 
toward the steering column while cranking it.  What gives??  It's as if the 
lock portion is now worn, although the lock that's in there is a 
replacement one...(don't know how long it's been there).  Does anyone have 
any thoughts as to how to rectify this?  tia, Greg
