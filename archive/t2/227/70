Subject: Re: [T2] FS: '78 Champagne Edition Westy


I have one coming back from the painters this weekend.

Camper edition and the bus are different.

Bus has brown inside interior(dash, brake handle,window handles...etc).
The wallboards had "chrome" tape on them(long since gone on mine).


Three stripes on the outside(brown, gold, orange).

Weird carpet and seat colors.  Seats are "fox red" 
smooth(not basketweave) vinyl with another red color velour insert.

Carpet was the same except more of a bright rust color.

I think the campers had a different upholstery scheme, and I don't
know if they had the stripes or not.

Pictures after I get mine back from the painters!

Cheers, dave
