You should consider running the "+" wire from the vdo gauge back to the 
battery instead of to the fuse box.  You are seeing the result of a voltage 
drop through the wiring caused by the load of the headlights.  If you wire 
the gauge directly to the battery, it will be on all of the time (even with 
the engine off).  The gauge will work a really long time this way and won't 
drain your battery, but if it makes you feel better you can put in a switch 
to shut it off.  If you want to be really slick, use a relay triggered by 
the ignition to supply voltage to the gauge directly from the 
battery.  Either way, you will see a much smaller voltage drop when you 
turn on the lights, and get a more accurate indication of the state of your 
battery.

This is another symptom of the same problem.  You could upgrade the main 
wire supplying power to the front of your bus, but it's not an easy thing 
to do.  If you used the relay trick above, you could supply the power to 
all of your gauges through it directly from the battery which should 
eliminate the problem.
