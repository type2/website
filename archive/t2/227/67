Only one little glitch here---

You friend doesn't have the mechanical aptitude to even know how to open
the hood--
You do.

So if he was in the same situation, with anything, not only a VW, he
would have still been in the same spot.

True, the problem just might have been found faster at the dealer if it
was a Bus--but maybe not-----they didn't find a simple coil wire failure
either--
Which I do find hard to believe--because the scanner would have almost
immediately located the open circuit in the ignition.

8 days to find a broken coil wire?
 
Who said the wrenches at GM were geniuses?

Reliability is in direct conjunction with the amount of time one wants
to spend working on his vehicle, and the VW's demand much more than the
norm----
It's a "Bonding" thing---:>)

My 3 cents--

Later,

My take on "reliability" is that if the vehicle gets you where you're
going, when you want it to, then it's "reliable." If parts are replaced
when those crafty Germans say they should (DM), then they are most
unlikely to fail under use. 
A friend of mine refuses to consider an AC VW, as he claims they are
"unreliable." He, it seems, is in the *unique* situation where he MUST
get to work on time everyday, or his boss will get mad. So, he buys a
new Saturn every three years. One day, his two month old Saturn would
not start. Since he doesn't know how to open the hood, he had to have it
towed to the dealer, got a loaner, didn't make it to work that day. 
After five days of scrutinizing the printouts from the computerized
analysis equipment, they still couldn't figure out the problem--so they
sent the readouts 
back to the factory. After a couple of days, the factory folks hadn't
figured out 
the problem either. They suggested that the dealer's mechanics <gasp>
PHYSICALLY look at the car to see if the electrical gremlin could be
discovered in this way. Within only a few hours, they discovered that a
mouse had eaten through the ignition wire going to the coil. Only took
eight days for him to get his car back. 
If this had happened to my bus, it would have taken me five minutes to
discover the difficulty, and perhaps another five to correct the
problem-- probably even make it to work on time. 
So which car is more "reliable"?
