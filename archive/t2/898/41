Silicone has something in it that attacks paint ,, or steel and allows it to 
rust out... so I have been told.

If you want a good sealer.. used in the marine, camper, and truck trailer 
body industry.. try Sikaflex - 221

I'll let you google it if you interested.. you'll find it is about $10 a 
tube..
