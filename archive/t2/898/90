Normally I would direct John and other list members to a link on my website
dealing with this problem, but apparently my ISP (C-Zone.net) are having
technical difficulties (they're workin' on it).....

Link when it's back up is:  http://www.oldvolkshome.com/7374altvr.pdf

In the meantime, I have sent a copy of the PDF to John via pmail.  If any
others would like a copy of this PDF by pmail, I will be happy to provide
it.
