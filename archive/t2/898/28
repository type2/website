 My precious Instruciton Manual 1972 Typ 2 englisch says

 The belt designation is
 9.5 x 900 LA "DA"
 9.5 x 905 LA "DA"
 9.5 x 905 LA "XDA"

 As no spare belt came with my '73 bus, I just
bought on a 50g gamble at a church fair a Gates
10 x 890.  I take this to mean the contour length
is 10 mm less than the designated 900 and the
section is 0.5 mm (a small amount, no?) bigger;
so do these figures imply that even with numerous
washers removed this belt still won't fit?
Has anyone tried to fit a 10 x 890 ?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1st number 9.5 or 10 is the width of the belt at its widest point in mm.

The 2nd number is the length of the belt in mm.

No, 10 x 890 does not mean it is a 900mm belt less 10mm.

If and only if, you use a wider belt and you have the shims to do it, then you will need a longer belt. Not a
shorter one.
