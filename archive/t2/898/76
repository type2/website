Subject: Re: [T2] Starting the Bus for the first time, what do I do?

Thanks guys for all the help!


I haven't actually started it YET... but I spent the past few hours since my
post working on the wiring up in the cabin. I guess it's like with all things,
the more you work at it, the easier it is for you to understand and for your
brain to consume. I'm really glad that I decided to use all original wiring,
and rebuild the harness as it would have been when stock. I had purchased a
complete generic "Painless" kit (which was actually quite painful), but I
ended up not using it.

I've got all the turn signals, headlights, and parking lights all wired up.


By the way, that reminds me. Exactly WHAT relays do I need to purchase? I
don't have any relays currently..

I know the rear defog uses one and I think the turn signals also use 1... are
there any others that I might be missing?


Thanks!

Todd
