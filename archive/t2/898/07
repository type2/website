Subject: '78 westy engine not running well 

Well, I've finally gotten around to doing some more investigating regarding the following problem:  will not idle, only starts and stays running if throttle is open some (etc), got 135 lbs compression in 3 cylinders, 50 lbs in the #4.
   
  I did a leak down test on the #4 at TDC.  No air escaping at all (through tailpipe, gurgline in the dipstick, nothing).  So that leads me to believe that my suspicion that I dropped a seat on the exhaust valve is perhaps not correct.
   
  Took a screwdriver to the rocker arms on both valves on the #4 and they were *very* squishy.
   
  Played aroun with opening the clearance and closing back down, but they remain kind of squishy.  Engine did improve a little in terms of me being able to keep it running (and being able to start it) while fooling around with the valve adjustments.  With me leaning on the throttle, it seems to run well at like 3000 rpm.  If I let off, it dies.
   
  Timing was right before I started all of this.  Made sure vacuum lines and such were okay.  Have not tested the compression int he #4 again to see if it went up at all.
   
  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  I'm trying desparately to get this thing going again but hs been a challenge.  I was prepared to drop the engine and replace the head (if that's what I had to do) but thought I'd do the leak down beforehand.  No I'm kind of back where I started.  Pondering and such.
   
  Thanks a lot - and happy friday.
