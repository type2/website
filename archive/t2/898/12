In addition to rennovating my 35 year old bus, I am also rennovating my 100+ year old home, and am currently having $30K worth of plastic nailed to the ouside walls.  The folks doing that are going to apply "liquid siding" to the victorian trim, which they tell me will be a 1/8" thick coating of PVC and is sprayed on in 3 coats.  That might just be the ticket for the bus as well.  Will likely hide the sanding scratches.
