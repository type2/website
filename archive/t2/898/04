Subject: Wheel cover

We kept the leather cover that was on the bus when we bought it.   
However, it was really loose,
ie moved under my hands.  The answer for us was to buy a cheap hard  
foam cover, remove the
leather one, cut the foam cover & slip it on (which left a gap at the  
bottom of the wheel of about
  4 inches) put original leather cover over the top and stitch back  
on.  Instant (well an hour or so)
padded and thick wheel cover that doesn't move under my hands.
