Subject: Re: [T2] Sealing a Hightop(converted)

Just cover it with your tarp when your at home , buy the tar rope, bring it
to HCBF and I and a few other guys will lift to roof off and do it right ,
put the tar on the line up the top and screw it down. No more worries and
the top just come off once!! And your done.!
