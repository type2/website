Yes, I would agree.  Replacement Motorola Regulators I have sold over the
years have had wire colors that were not consistent.  My diagram was taken
from the Motorola installation on my 73 Ghia, which I know for a fact was
original when new.  I suppose the main thing is to be sure the connection to
the Alternator is consistent to the plug arrangement I show in my PDF.

I also agree, that most would be better off upgrading to the AL82 with the
built-in regulator, that way there's almost no wiring mistakes to be made.

Thanks
