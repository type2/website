Subject: backfire spitties

hi all, on my 1600SP, 035 dist, i recently put in everything new on  
the dist and set dwell to 50 with new braided vac hoses. valves are  
spot on twice checked. idle is at 950. here's the situation, i am  
having backfire spits usually on downhill glides esp at the 3-3300  
rpm range. i hesitate on a long trip until i discuss it some. my  
first hunch is exhaust leak at the donut gaskets because i reused  
some fairly new wire type ones on a re-ring job last month.  it was  
tight for the first 250 miles of break in. made some minor  
adjustments with the tune up and now the spits. advise on what  
generally causes the spits appreciated.

could be the mudflaps. anytime i add vanity this is what i  
get..   :)       - steve
