That's your brake warning light.  It comes on when it detects a difference
in pressure between the front and rear brake circuits at your master
cylinder when the brakes are applied, which means that one has probably
failed.  It normally has a red lens with a "B" or brake symbol printed on
it.

On later model buses, I believe that it self-tests when the ignition
switch is on without the engine running.   Early models have push-to-test.

If it comes on when you're pushing the brake pedal you have reason for
concern.  Otherwise it is either testing itself or malfunctioning in some
way.

I've had more instances of the warning light circuit failing then the
brakes themselves having a problem!
