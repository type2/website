Subject: near-enough belt?

	My precious Instruciton Manual 1972 Typ 2 englisch says

		The belt designation is
	9.5 x 900 LA "DA"
	9.5 x 905 LA "DA"
	9.5 x 905 LA "XDA"

As no spare belt came with my '73 bus, I just
bought on a 50g gamble at a church fair a Gates
10 x 890.  I take this to mean the contour length
is 10 mm less than the designated 900 and the
section is 0.5 mm (a small amount, no?) bigger;
so do these figures imply that even with numerous
washers removed this belt still won't fit?
	Has anyone tried to fit a 10 x 890 ?
