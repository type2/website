<<Some colors aren't UV resistant. At least that was the case in 96 when
I wanted to get my truck lined in white. I would have needed a clear
coating on it to provide UV resistance or the stuff would have quickly
gone brittle.>>

That was then Don, this is now.

I used this product called Raptor Hide
bedliner, that's two part. ( three with the color ) 

Product, hardner, and the color. ( which is just some base coat of the
color of choice)

It's guaranteed to stay put, retain the color for as long as you own
your vehicle.

Neat stuff---and the color doesn't chaulk out.

If a guy took the time to clean up the underside of his Bus / Van it
makes for a real tough, easy to use undercoat.
