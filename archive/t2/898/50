hi all, on my 1600SP, 035 dist, i recently put in everything new on
the dist and set dwell to 50 with new braided vac hoses. valves are
spot on twice checked. idle is at 950. here's the situation, i am
having backfire spits usually on downhill glides esp at the 3-3300
rpm range. i hesitate on a long trip until i discuss it some. my
first hunch is exhaust leak at the donut gaskets because i reused
some fairly new wire type ones on a re-ring job last month.  it was
tight for the first 250 miles of break in. made some minor
adjustments with the tune up and now the spits. advise on what
generally causes the spits appreciated.

could be the mudflaps. anytime i add vanity this is what i
get..   :)       - steve
