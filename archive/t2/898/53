Subject: Some free stuff, but there's a catch

Hi all,

I signed on to the list just long enough to take care of this left-over 
business.

I'm cleaning out my garage in preparation for my impending move, and 
yesterday I held a yard sale to get rid of some equipment I don't need 
anymore. Unfortunately, it was 107 degrees by noon, and not good for a 
yard sale. So I'm stuck with this stuff:

A Harbor Freight engine stand
A HB ATV jack (the kind that ratwell has on his site)
One of those expensive mounts that substitutes for "an old bell housing"
A stud welder

I'll give these away to anyone who is willing to make a $20 donation to 
the type2 list fund (that's the catch). And you have to pick them up. 
I'm in northern San Diego county.

P-mail me.

Mark Hineline
