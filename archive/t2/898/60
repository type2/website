Subject: Alternator swap

I just swapped out a 1600. The motor I pulled had a Bosch alternator with
one spade connector labeled D. The new motor has a Bosch alternator with
three spade connectors labelled D, D+ and DF. I put the one wire on the D
terminal, but I'm an not getting charging. What do I need to attach to the
other two wires? I'm thinking to jump battery power over to the DF to
energize the internal fields? But what about D+?

Thanks,

John
