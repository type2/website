Subject: Auto Shippers info needed ASAP

I am in the middle of a move and need any recommendations you all might 
have for auto shippers. Moving from Philly, PA to Spokane, WA.

We were going to trailer it ourselves, but have had to expedite moving 
plans and now I need to fly out instead of driving my baby across 
country or moving it ourselves.

I have quotes from a number of companies but would love to get personal 
referrals rom those of you who have done this before.
Please also send along bad egg reports too so I can weed out those who 
have not performed well.

Thanks
