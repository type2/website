Do SP engines have brake booster vacuum lines?  I had the same problem
on my 1600 DP and it turned out to be a old busted up decaying brake
booster vacuum line. I replace the line and the popping went away.
Unfortunately the problem has recently returned, this time I think
I've got a torn booster diaphragm.
