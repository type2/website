Subject: DVDA distributor timing

Greetings VW's

Questions about a DVDA distributor (0231 181 012) on a 1979 CA engine: What is
the best timing to set this thing for a smooth idle and cool engine?

In the archive there is a recommendation to remove or plug the retard vacuum
from the DVDA distributor  and time the engine to 7.5 BTDC.

Old Volks Home distributor info says to set the timing to 5 ATDC for this DVDA
distributor (it's from a 1976) and keep the retard vacuum on.

My VWFLAPS has a Bentley (I don't - yet!). They said the spec is for 7.5 BTDC
with retard vacuum hoses on.

Local VW mechanic says to set the DVDA to 0 TDC with retard on, and adjust to
5 ATDC for smog test later.

Anyone know what to do?

Thank U!
