Subject: Re: [T2] Re: backfire spitties

I just returned from a trip where I noticed this.

I did a search for coasting backfire in the archives and came up with
three possibilities.

Vacuum leaks (might be a problem for me)
Exhaust leaks (pretty sure this is my problem)
Running too lean or rich (least likely but still a possibility [bad
AFM or other problem])

I have a 2L with EFI.  I also have a rough cold start.
I plan on starting with vacuum leaks, and graduating to exhaust leaks
but I hear bad bad bad stories about exhaust leaks.

Anyone have any tips for preventing exhaust stud problems?
