Subject: [T2] Sealing a Hightop(converted)

whats the best way to seal a hightop where the self tapping screws were used?
   
  i have a bad leak coming in from one or a few self tapping screws.... havent yet sealed the to ....wondering what should be used so that it wont have to be done again later on like silicone will....
  i was thinking a piece of sticky insulation strip and then set top back over it but will that mess up the screws and them not be as tight next time i screw them back into the hole?
   
  these being self tappers didnt know if that would hender them being taken out....
   
  now to figure out how my wife and i wil get this lifted up enough to put a seal on it....
  fun fun....
   
  should i put some silicone on the self tappers before i put them back in?
  that silicone stuff dont last long enough though....~!~
   
  maybe one day the top will have to come off the bus to go on another but for today i want it sealed up tight for winter ahead and also the rains .....nothing worse than camping and everything get soaked throughout the bus.....
  been there and done that....
   
  hoping to seal it up as beast as possible....
  but with minimal  cost in mind.
   
   
  thanks
