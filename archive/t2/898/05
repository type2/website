Subject: My new Hankook RA08s

I must say that the difference in the ride between my 3 ply 1500 lb load 
rated tires and my new Hankook RA08s is amazing.  I cannot describe how 
much better it is.  Unfortunately I was unable to support our familiar 
vendor with this one.  There was an authorized Hankook dealer about 20 
minutes away that ordered the tires from Hankook.  4 days later and $330 
lighter (after taxes) I was riding in style.  Have a great weekend 
everyone.  I'm taking the kids camping at Yogi Bears Jellystone Park in 
Estes Park.  Gonna try out my new Harbour Freight clips that I got to 
hold the tarp to the rain gutter.  It seems very secure.  Much more so 
than the clamps I got from Home Depot.

Happily rolling down the road,

dan
