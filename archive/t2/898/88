From the factory, it ONLY runs the fridge. If you don't use the fridge as a
fridge.....save your money.



True, however I have wired two extra interior lights to mine to use while
camping so I don't have to worry about running down the main battery. Plus,
when plugged into AC power it's easy to recharge. I used just a plain old
deep cycle battery, and it has worked very well. You need to get the
adaptors to fit the battery posts that have the wing nut terminals to make
the connections.    Jeff
