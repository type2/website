Some colors aren't UV resistant. At least that was the case in 96 when I
wanted to get my truck lined in white. I would have needed a clear coating
on it to provide UV resistance or the stuff would have quickly gone brittle.
The shop said no problem with most colors, but white required this special
treatment.
