Check out an RV store. There's a Camping World around here that's got 
rolls of different types of sealing stuff. I looked there when I put my 
hightop on, but I decided to just go with not anything. So far, it's 
worked out really well. The roof doesn't seem to leak that much, and if 
it does leak, it goes onto the existing roof, which means it rolls back 
out again when the bus stops. My rear hatch seal leaks more than my roof.
