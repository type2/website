<<Has anyone done any 'how-to' guides on this process? 
I see those all the time, although ive only seen the offroad trucks
around here sporting that paint job. 
I like it. Call me crazy, but I think it looks great. >>


Sure it's easy.
Run the vehicle through a car wash to get it clean.

Let it dry well.


Mask off everything you don't want the bed liner on.

Lightly skuff the surface to be painted with 180 paper.

Blow the dust off.

Blow on the bed liner.

For a more textured finish allow 30 minutes to dry between coats--the
more you back away from the surface being painted with the body shutz
gun the heavier the texture.

Allow to dry over night.

Remove the masking paper & tape.

Your done.

The bed liner can be tinted with any base coat color--if you get the
tintable bed liner.

Piece of Cake---
