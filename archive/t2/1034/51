Subject: FI to Dual Carb Conversion

I have looked all through the archives and read about all the pro's and con's
but need to know if there are any write up's on how to do the swap. I need to
know what to take off on the FI and what I might need to add or change in the
engine bay for the new engine. It is a custom turn-key porche motor, so I am
not using the old motor, just doing a swap.
Thanks,
Bob
