close my sliding door today.. well lets say.. It wouldnt... close.. bong..
close dang it bong... well my lower roller went to crud and folded over... And
i cant find one anywhere.. and really dont have a ton of money to spend on an
entire new door yet.. Does anyone have a lower roller setup?? How about the
rear plastic slider thing that goes next to the ball bearing roller? And any
tips on making sure the rear door latch actually latches would be a help.. as
i found mine is only going 1/2 way and not fully closing.. yeah i have
adjusted the inner piece etc.. still no dice.. and is there a proper position
to have the handle in to do it?anyways.. i was out looking at it today.. and
went to get it close to close position so i could lift door and push in the
back.. door fell out lol.. i really need some lower rollers please :) if
anyone can help let me know im in Utah zip 84401
