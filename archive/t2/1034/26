Subject: 1971 Westy vs 1973 Riviera

So, as I see it here is my situation...

1.  Have four of us going camping (2 children, 2 adults)
2.  Have 1776 single port engine
3.  Have 6 rib tranny (from 76 bus) converted to work with motor

1973 Riviera has...
...double bed upstairs
...stove and 12v refrigerator

1971 Westy has...
...cot up top

If I swap out the motor then I will have to deal with engine tin (no big
problem...I may even be able to modify some stuff I have from my old 76 bus)
and I will have problems mounting the motor (bigger problem... Is there a
mount for the tranny?  How do I mount the motor at all?)

If I swap out the top of the 73 on to the 71...Will it work?  What problems
would I have if I wanted to swap out the furnace or the stove?

Decisions, decisions, decisions...

I think I will go take a closer look at the 73 this evening.  I appreciate all
of your ideas and input and if there is anything else you folks want to
add...please help.

Thanks,
