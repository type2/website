Subject: head light relay

put a new dimmer relay on today.  still same problem.  will click but
the new relay will not keep brights on.  put the old relay back on
after cleaning some contacts and changing out some connectors and now
the old relay works 90% of the time.  the new one still only clicks.
any ideas?  should i buy another new relay?  all the contacts seem
clean now and all connections look good.  am i missing a ground
somewhere?  i need these high beams to pass safety inspection.

thanks,

jeremiah
