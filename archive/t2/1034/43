Subject: sealant between cylinder and case?

In the past, I've used silicone sealant on the spacers between 
cylinders and case. When it comes time to rebuild,  it is a lot of 
trouble rubbing that silicone off  and I've never found a solvent for 
it. Anyone have experience that says this joint won't leak if I 
polish the cylinder end and the shim on, say, 600 paper and don't use 
sealant?
