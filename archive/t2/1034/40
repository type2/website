Subject: Re: [T2] Valve spring compressor?

Used to be able to rent them at rental places and some auto parts stores. 
I've made my own similar to the old Type 1 factory type and also purchased a 
similar factory type from Cip1 for about $30. Recently I bought 3 KD #380 
spring compressors for $15 each from a rental place that was getting rid of 
their automotive tools. The KD #380 is my preferred spring compressor.
