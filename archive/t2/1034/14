Subject: 1971 Westy vs 1973 Riviera

I have been working on my 1971 Westy for some time now but may have a line on
a 1973 Riviera.  I can't believe I am actually thinking about this but a may
want to shift my efforts.  The 73 has a full bunk upstairs for my two kids but
does not have an engine or tranny.  I just go a 1776 single-port with an 6 rib
tranny conversion in the 71.  I am thinking that I might be able to put the
engine/tranny into the 73 and get on the road faster and with better camping
options.

Any words of wisdom, insight, warning, etc...???

Thanks.
