Subject: On the road again.....

Well gang, last night I got the last crucial bit done and Zoey is back on
the road! After a 5 month coma that started because I had to put on a new
exhaust, she is running like a champ. This weekend, I plan on hooking up the
heat exchangers and putting the exchanger caps that I fabbed on as well.

Even my boy was excited to go for a "bus ride" for the first time in a VERY
long time.

I am just glad to be back in the game and thank all of you who have helped
me get through all this crap.

The list is priceless!!!
