Subject: conductive paint

Hey all, i need a line on conductive paint to restore an AFM for a 78 Bus
I took the top off the AFM and the wiper has left a trail on the circuit
board,
so there is a gap in continuity there, any ideas where i can get this?
Radioshack =nogo, i was told auto repair stores will have it, but i get the
typical dumb look
from a grease monkey wannabe when i ask and try to describe it to
them..anybody know a brand or vendor?
