Subject: valve adjustment

78 2.0L hydraulics
ok heres the thing, i adjusted my valves according to the spoken norm for
hydraulic .
warm , hand turn engine til rotor turns counterclockwise to #1 adjust to
zero and then 1-2 turns tighter and so on , 2-3-and 4. right?
well i thought the fan was not seating right so when the bus warmed up, it
would start making a noise like they ( the valves)were out of adjustment
like the piston was whapping the valve.when i got home last nite a
re-adjusted them from 2 turns past zero , back to zero and 1/4 turn
tighter..
this morning i drove it to work, when its cold it sounds awesome, then
slowly warms and starts making noise, so when i got to work i took off the
fan and started it briefly to see if it indeed was the fan and it was not,
so i mustve adjusted the valves wrong huh?...i dont get it ...HELP
