Subject: Double Bed in a early Bay Top

I have visited the Type 2 website and found some articles on putting bigger
bed in the top of early Bay Westies but it has really been either to replace
the top with a later bay top or to do some sort of conversion of the bunk.

Has anyone just tried to put a double bed bunk (facing in the opposite
direction) in an early Bay Westy?

It seems like such a simple idea (almost too simple).

Advice, ideas, suggestions????

Thanks,
