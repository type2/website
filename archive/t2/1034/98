push on the bottom of the rocker arms to see if any are soft.  If so, 
then you have hyd lifters.  If none are soft, take one out to verify - 
that or look at the pushrods.. if you have thin steel pushrods, you most 
likely have hyd lifters.. if they're fat aluminum pushrods, most likely 
solid lifters.

You can also adjust them to the 0.006 spec for solid lifters which will 
allow them to pump up if they're not already.  The valves might not open 
up as much as they should, but that's better than staying open too long. 
  Then after they stop making a lot of noise, you can tighten them back 
down to 1.5 turns past contact.

Do make sure you do a sanity check that you're adjusting the correct 
cylinder!  Do you have a stock dizzy in there or an 009.  Things can get 
confusing w/ an 009 because the rotor points in a different direction. 
I would do the following test regardless..

The best way to figure it out is to follow the firing order 1-4-3-2 
while spinning the crank CLOCKWISE.  Start out with the timing mark at 
0, this is one of two TDCs for cylinder 1.  Spin the crank CLOCKWISE and 
watch the #1 cylinder rocker arms.  When the #1 intake valve closes 
(bottom of arm moves towards engine), spin the crank about another 180 
degrees to line up the timing mark with 0 and you are now at #1 TDC 
firing position.  Mark this on your dizzy if it's not already marked.

Now you can spin the crank COUNTER-clockwise from that point to adjust 
2, 3, and 4.


Hope that helps!
Mike
