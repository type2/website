Subject: Looks like thats out

Well it looks like just replacing the lower assy is out.. Now i need  
the center rear assy.. My door is all messed up, it fell out again...  
and in doing so broke a pin in the back looks like a hook like pin and  
helps it latch.. dang it.. Guess i will go spend 50 and get a complete  
door assy tomorrow :( gonna be hard to get the kids in and out now...
