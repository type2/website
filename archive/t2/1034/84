Subject: Metal Sliding Sunroof Seal

Hi all, I hope you can help.  I've been on the list for nearly a year and
it's amazing!  I have a 1979 sunroof bus with the original metal sliding
roof.  I bought a 3 peice felt seal kit for it and I need to know if the
seal gets glued to the bus around the rim of the opening?  Or does it
get glued to the edge of the sliding roof?  It looks to me like it should go
around the roof - but I want to be sure.

One other thing - if anyone has the 4 plastic trim peices that cover the
sunroof cable tubes and gear box in good usable shape, I'd be interested in
buying them.  Mine are cracked and brittle.

Thanks - Nick
