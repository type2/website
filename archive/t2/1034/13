You probably don't have the means to repair the 'circuit
board'.  It is a thick-film resistor network on an alumina
substrate.  The 'conductive paint' is resistor ink which
is usually screen printed onto the substrate.  It is then
fired in an 800 deg C furnace.

Some have sucessfully repaired their AFM by loosening
the screws which hold the 'circuit board' to the housing.
Then moving it a mm or two and *carefully* retightening
the screws.  And/or bending the wiper arm.  The idea here
is to have the wiper arm drag on a fresh track, away from
the groove it has worn.
Buy a remanufactured AFM when all else fails.
