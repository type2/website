Subject: Valve spring compressor?

Hi Guys,

I have my 81 air cooled heads sitting on the bench, doing a low cost
evaluation. Can't find a valve spring compressor to get the valves out.

Tried the autozone and other flaps for tool rentals, and they don't have
them. I see some on ebay for $100, but that doesn't fit in with the low cost
evaluation goal. :-)

Anyone come up with a kewl way to get the valve keepers off so I can take a
peek at the seats and the valves?

I don't mind jury rigging for a one time job, just don't see the sport in
spending a ton for something if there is another way to go.

Thanks,

John
