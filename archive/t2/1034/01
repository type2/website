<d1ea44890804151306tca815fcp7fb46f558fb9e268(-at-)mail.gmail.com> I finally got my
exhaust system on and am very excited to being soooo closeto driving Zoey
again. Two days ago, I got her fired up and felt around to see if I had
anynoticeable leaks from where I installed new gaskets. I did. As I felt
around a few of the connections, I could feel a light amount ofexhaust coming
out of a few of the joints. Now when I prepped the flangesurfaces on my heat
exchangers (they are pretty beat up) I ground them asflat as I could and
banged them with a small sledge until they wererelatively flat. However, I can
still feel a breeze. Question: Is there anything I can add to them that will
help seal up the gaps? Is isreally even that big of a deal? I saw that
Permatex sells a spray on gasket sealer that is rated to 500degrees. I am just
afraid that it gets to hotter than 500 and that it willjust burn off. Any
suggestions?

After I flatten the flange, I take a hammer and tweak the 'ends' where
the bolt holes are past flat. This way when you tighten the bolts, the center
makes contact first and then the bolts pull the flanges tight.
