 Don't try to repair it. Just bend the tangs so they move on different
 tracks.
 
 Colin's written about it, but I can't find the writeup just now.


From http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=178497 ;

You will see in the other replies that hack fixes are frowned upon. 
Heres my hack fix: (  ) 

Grab a jeweler's small regular screwdriver to slip under the wiper copper just
past the black plastic body that holds the copper. 
Use another screwdriver to bend the copper over the screwdriver into a dogleg.
You will see that the two buttons at the end of the copper are now closer to
the black plastic body. They are now able to use a fresh section of track. 
The only downside to this HACK repair is if you lose the tension that pushes
the copper buttons onto the track surface. With a little futzing, this too can
be overcome. 
This is a simple reliable repair.
