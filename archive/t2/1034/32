I have a front cot but I don't think it will work with my 7 year old.  I may
have no choice.  I was just visiting the Type 2 website and found, I think, an
article about putting a bed on the top.  It would be nice if someone who had
done this to send some pictures since I am having a visualization problem.
:-)

Other suggestions?

Thanks...Michael
