Subject: locks/ keys/ 914 tranny

Hey everyone,
   
  Thanks for the info, what if one of the cylinders inside the door handle is missing for the key, what can I do then? do they sell new lock cylinders that I can make match my old ones once I get the numbers to match? 
   
  Also, I am looking to upgrade my engine and tranny in my 57 single cab and was womdering if a 916 5 speed will fit in w/o many modifications, i can weld.. but I really want to maintain my wide 5 lug type... and I really dont want to cut anything up too much... what engine/ tranny combo would be good here... performance ans speed are good, but w gas prices, I still ant to use my 40hp on occaisions...
   
  TYVM..-Ron
