Subject: ok, need help again.. :(

Hey guys.. Well i went to close my sliding door today.. well lets  
say.. It wouldnt... close.. bong.. close dang it bong... well my lower  
roller went to crud and folded over... And i cant find one anywhere..  
and really dont have a ton of money to spend on an entire new door  
yet.. Does anyone have a lower roller setup?? How about the rear  
plastic slider thing that goes next to the ball bearing roller?  And  
any tips on making sure the rear door latch actually latches would be  
a help.. as i found mine is only going 1/2 way and not fully closing..  
yeah i have adjusted the inner piece etc.. still no dice.. and is  
there a proper position to have the handle in to do it?anyways.. i was  
out looking at it today.. and went to get it close to close position  
so i could lift door and push in the back.. door fell out lol.. i  
really need some lower rollers please :) if anyone can help let me  
know im in Utah zip 84401
