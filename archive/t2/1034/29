Subject: 1970 Bay Brake Conversion to 1971 Discs

Good Afternoon Everybody,

I posted awhile back regarding my wiring problems with my 1970 Bay that I
found in Detroit.  Between trips home from college I was able to locate the
missing wires as tucked behind and underneath the dash.  I'm still in limbo
as to getting my glass installed, and I'll be in South America in two weeks,
but I had a question to ask about brakes.  My drums are fine, and work well
when I've driven around at home, but I was thinking about trying to swap to
discs.



There's a guy who lives near me with the front beam and brakes from a 71 Bay
for sale on thesamba for a decent price that says its the disc style.  I was
wondering if this would be an easy conversion for a guy who is new to Busses
to undertake.  I'm mainly a Beetle guy who tinkers when home from college
and not at work.

Thanks,

Nick
