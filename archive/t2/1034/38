Hi Karl, that looks like a simple way to go.

Have you used it on the air cooled head? The reason I ask, is I am concerned
about being able to get to the keepers, once I get the spring compressed.
Hard to tell from the pic, but is there room for fat fingers, and maybe a
magnet or two?

Much obliged,

John
