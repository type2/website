The '73 Riviera is definitely the better setup for camping, but IMO it 
is not worth putting the 71 drivetrain into the '73.  No rear engine 
mount being the main problem, but you will also have engine tin sealing 
issues.

No significant one-year-only stuff on the '73.  It is the first year for 
the over-the-engine hatch, first year of the thicker-pad disk brakes, 
first year of rectangular bumpers and high mounted turn signals.  They 
also changed the air control levers and ductwork in '73, I think.

I'd probably keep the '71 simply because of the lack of engine and 
tranny in the '73.
