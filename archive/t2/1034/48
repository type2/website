I did the swap from a '68 braking system to a '79 braking system. I swapped
the entire rear spindle assembly on both sides with no rubbing problems.

you have to be careful here because the compound drum setup of the 71- 
up buses is wider than the 68-70, which is why the later buses have  
the flared rear wheel opening. the tires might rub if you put the  
late drums on a early bus.
