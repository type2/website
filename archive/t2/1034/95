Get yourself a wideband O2 sensor and then you'll be able to adjust it 
back to your liking.  This is a good investment regardless because you 
can constantly monitor your mix and see when things are acting up.  I'd 
recommend the Innovate LC-1.

... that, or bring it to a smog shop and have them hook up an exhaust 
analyzer and bring it back into smog passing spec.  That'd be pretty 
close to stock tune, assuming everything else is stock and hooked up 
correctly.
