Subject: Re: [T2] Smelling Gas

The fuel air mixture is not likely to be the problem if the engine is running normally.

Two things come to mind...

Gas tank level sender gasket:  This gasket dries out and allows fuel vapor to escape.  The sender is on top of the tank, and theorretically you must pull the engine abd remove the tank to access it.  In reality, most folks just cut a hole in the rear deck so they can access the sender...once that is done it's a 30 second fix.

You replaced the fuel lines...did you check them all for leaks/tightness? 

What about the fuel tank vent hoses?  This is an entirely seperate system from the pressurized lines, and will also allow vapor leaks, or liquid leaks if the tank is full.   

The archives and/or library should have more details.

Now that I have everything going, my wife noticed a pretty strong smell of
gas coming from the rear. I examined the engine both underneath and inside
the engine compartment but cannot see any noticeable leaks. Could it
possibly be that if the AFM is not adjusted properly and is running to rich
that I will smell gas then? I would imagine so but I am not sure.
