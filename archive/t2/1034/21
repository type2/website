Subject: 1.8s and 2.0s and ljet oh my!

hey guys.. Looking at this engine.. still think it may have solid  
lifters.. dont think its a 79 cause no o2 sensor.. and the heads dont  
have square exhaust ports.. so.. I was thinking maybe its not a 2.0..  
but i looked at the flywheel and the clutch plate goes all the way to  
the edge.. isnt that a tell tale sign of a 2.0?? and what is the  
difference between the flywheels? looking for the Ljet parts... i  
drive 80 miles a day.. want the power mileage reliability etc....
