Subject: Original Hubcaps for 78 Westy wanted

Hi Volks:

After going through a number of crappy after-market wheel covers, I'd 
like to find a set of the original dome-style hubcaps with the VW logo 
in the center.  Nothing in Sacramento so far, but haven't been able to 
find the "Hubcap Man" in South Sac in.  Does anyone on the list 
(including the vendors) have any ideas where to get these?

Thanks,

BEN
