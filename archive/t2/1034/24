There exists special tin for putting the type 1 into a '73, but it was
euro-only and therefore rare and expensive.  You can also get aftermarket
stuff to do the same thing.

My advice is to keep the '71 drivetrain in the '71 and fix the '73 with
its original engine setup.  The type IV is really a much better engine.

If I was set on swapping an engine into the '73, I'd go for a Subaru.
Given the choice between tinwork and plumbing, I find plumbing easier.  It
would be a big job, though.
