Steve,

Sorry to hear that man. I respect your desire to not "name names" but
frankly, like an eBay situation, I want to know if the person I am looking
to work with has screwed anyone else. I see a growing trend in America today
where people are so feverish over a good deal, that they couldn't care less
what the customer service is like in the process.

Now I know we have a few list member here that remember the time when
service was the norm, but seems to be a dying art form now. I honestly would
liek to know who it was so that I can take that into consideration should I
decide to buy from them. Your interaction sucked - why should others have to
fall victim if it can be avoided.

Understand, I work in food service and if there is one thing I cannot stand,
it is BAD service. I don't care if you are the CEO of IBM or putting erasers
on the ends of pencils. Your customers pay your bills and should always be
dealt with in manner that will make them come back to you again. No excuses.
