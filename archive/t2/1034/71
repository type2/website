Subject: broken flywheel bolts

Hey guys  Here is a good one for you . last Thursday just as we were  leaving 
the shop for Everybus ,I have a aircooled vanagon towed in. The cooling  fan 
had chucked the belt and broke the fan bolts off. I roll the van off the tow  
truck and go to start it and drive it into the shop. Well the starter makes a  
real bad sound. So I push the clutch in and try to start it.The clutch petal 
was  jumping . I told the guy it wasn't going to everybus this year and loaned 
him my  passat wagen to use instead.  Came back Monday and removed the 
engine. The  flywheel stayed in the bellhousing. It had broken all 5 bolts , 4 of 
them clean  snaps. I was able to remove the broken parts and replaced the 
flywheel and  torqued new bolts on the crank.  After fixing the cooling fan hub and  
reinstalling it I put the motor back in. When I went to start the motor I 
found  that the dizzy had jumped up enough for the rotor not to turn.  Anybody  
have any idea what happened here.? Did the broken fan belt cause this or did 
the  dizzy jump and cause it or did the flywheel come off first??  I have seen  
this a bunch of times on type 1 motors but never before on a type 4. Motor ran 
 good when I got done with it and they are on their way back to Canada .   
later  mark dearing     Salem Import service   salem va
