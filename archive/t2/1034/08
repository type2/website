Rimco in Santa Ana, CA still does this:

(go to the bottom of the page)

Many years ago, EMPI use to distribute a great carburetor bushing/reamer kit
thru their WD outlets to the public (I carried 'em), but they were never a
big seller, so it was discontinued.  No sense stocking 'em, if you can't
sell 'em :-(
