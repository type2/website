Subject: Tuning the AFM

So how does one go about making sure that the mixture is correct? Does it *
have* to be taken in and adjusted by a tech or can it be done at home? I
know that my AFM is out of adjustment just because I have messed with it a
few times. I just want to get it back to where it needs to be.

-TIA
