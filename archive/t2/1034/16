Make sure that the spring bail is tight enough.  It should require a tool
to pop the bail on or off unless you are really strong.

You can bend the bail to get more force or buy new.

I put hylomar on the cover side of the gasket.  It doesn't harden, so it
seals well and cleans off easily.  The other side of the gasket is left
dry.
