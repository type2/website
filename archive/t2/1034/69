Jason,

It is most likely the fuel vent lines to the tank. All can be culprits.

Now that I have everything going, my wife noticed a pretty strong smell of
gas coming from the rear. I examined the engine both underneath and inside
the engine compartment but cannot see any noticeable leaks. Could it
possibly be that if the AFM is not adjusted properly and is running to rich
that I will smell gas then? I would imagine so but I am not sure.

If that happens to be it, is there a way to adjust the AFM without having to
take it in to a mechanic? I backed off the screw a little to see if I could
notice a difference, but didn't notice anything immediately. I figure that
adjusting the AFM will take a few minutes to flush out all the "richness"

TIA as always.

Oh, and all my fuel lines are new, so I am not worried about a crack in the
old stuff.
