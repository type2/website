Subject: Had to change my underwear.

So yesterday I cruising back home from work and keep feeling the weird
wagging feeling from the back of Zoey. Since I have new tires with less than
3000 miles on them, I first started to figure that something was wrong with
my rear axle or something. Well, a few minutes later this happened.

How nice it was that not 1 single person honked or waved to tell me a had a
flat before this happened. I must have driven a quarter mile at 45 MPH!

Funny thing is, I still haven't acquired a new jack since I broke the other
two I had. Told the wife I needed to buy one and she told me to wait until
pay-day. I told her that I has afraid I might get a flat. She replies "What
are the odds that you are gonna get a flat between now (Monday night) and
Friday?"

Well, I guess it "technically" wasn't a flat... though it started out that
way.

My brother came and loaned me his jack, and I immediately went to Discount
Tire to discuss the matter with them. See, 2 weeks earlier, I got a flat
while Zoe was sitting in the driveway because of a rotten valve stem. Seems
that the same thing happened again, but while I was driving this time.

Moral: Make sure to check your tires out regularly boys and girls...
