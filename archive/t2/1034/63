Subject: It is running

Hello all,

after 4 weekends of engine removal, rebuilding and reinstalling, my bus
is on the road again! Fired right up and idles very nicely. Drives very
good, but I did not rev it up, just some smooth cruising. Is there a
break-in period after one installs new heads? Oil change soon? Adjust
valves soon?
I bought a DakotaDigital CHT gauge, installed the sender and routed the
wiring to the dash. Now I'm unsure where to mount it. It should be in
the direct line of sight of the drivers position, I think. The PO
installed a dipstick oil temp gauge right above the tach using some
L-shaped sheet metal. Doesn't look sexy at all, since the wiring and
back of the gauge can be seen from outside. Do you think that it is a
good idea to install both gauges under the radio? This, of course,
involves cutting the padded dash. Do the gauges fit nicely despite of
the padding?

Help is always greatly appreciated.

Cheers,

Timo
