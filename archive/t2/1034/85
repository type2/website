dome style?  the round ones were pre '71.  After that they are flat.  I 
have a stack of flat ones.  Some are in better shape than others.  I 
could take some pics of what I have if you like.  They can often be 
cleaned up real nicely with some 0000 steel wool.

check with chris at the bustedbus.  i'm sure he has a much bigger stack 
of hubcaps than i do.
