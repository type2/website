Subject: Is the enemy of good, better?

Hi,

I know I have a bent push rod on my #3 cylinder. I saw it during my last
O ring replacement.

It is only slightly bent.

I find myself wondering, it is a 30 year old, untouched engine (basic
leaks and gaskets replaced of course) do I need to touch this or is it
better left for the rebuild it will need in the future?

It is my thought that whatever it is bashing at, likely has an indent in
it. As such, I would need to replace the things with indents in them as
well as the push rod to make things work.

I think after the engine is running for a while, the ticking stops and
all is well.

Also, I put too much oil in the engine and drove 80-100 KM before
dumping the excess oil. It was the better part of a litre. I heard the
ticking when I started it this year with plain oil in it for a little
drive to warm it up and then dumped everything.

It has Castrol 20W50.

Alan
