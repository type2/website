The alt light was on the dash a few minutes before catastrophe.... the 
driver assumed a thrown belt.. and with the condition of the road [high 
speed truck route] knew it would be better to drive a few minutes to an exit 
without an alt,  as the T4 engine still has a fan.. [well it did for a few 
more minutes!] 

Then it did it's little dance... and who knows what went first.. but i bet 
that the belt got hooked into the fan.. and the shroud.. brought the engine 
to almost a complete stop.. that shock zipped the flywheel bolts off.. and 
bounced the dist up.  I have seen the dist jump ... by never the flywheel 
bolts...   all I can say is W O W ....
