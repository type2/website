<000e01c8a0d8$99eb64a0$0301a8c0(-at-)DadDesktop> Hi Guys, I have my 81 air cooled
heads sitting on the bench, doing a low costevaluation. Can't find a valve
spring compressor to get the valves out. Tried the autozone and other flaps
for tool rentals, and they don't havethem. I see some on ebay for $100, but
that doesn't fit in with the low costevaluation goal. :-)
