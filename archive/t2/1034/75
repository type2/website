Steve,

Have you mentioned this issue on the buyer/seller feedback forum on
TS?  State the facts and keep your fellow VW folks informed.

Since the part was new and he didn't say "as-is" then the seller has some
moral obligation to make things right.  Defective parts that have been
installed _are_ returnable to reputable sellers, and I've done so quite a
few times.

One problem with the Internet is that anyone can set up a business with
whatever moral standards that they wish.  Most vendors
are upstanding folks, but every once in a while a bad egg pops up.  The
insulation provided by distance allows bad eggs to survive longer, but at
least we have the forums to get the word out.
