Subject: new key set

Hey everyone, I have a 1972 VW transporter that has NO KEYS, what is the best way to outfit this with keys? can I just buy new tumblers w keys for all locks and a new ignition key set or should I buy the handles and all? is there anyone in No. Cal that may have a used set of igniton and door set up w keys? or will a locksmith be best way to get keys made?
   
  Thanks everyone.
