Conductive paint will destroy it ... This is a variable resistor; in  
addition to conductivity you would also need to be concerned about  
matching the particular resistance of the material used on the  
circuit board. If you do not get it right, the characteristics of the  
entire AFM (not just the touched up section) will be messed up. Do  
what Don suggested: carefully bend the arm to ride on an undisturbed  
part of the original coating.
