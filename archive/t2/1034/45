You could swap the entire beam, booster, MC, and proportioning valve to
yield a good setup.  Then you would have to deal with the fact that your
front wheels have a different lug pattern than the rear.  Swapping the
rear hubs. brakes. etc. would fix that.

So, to do it right would require replacement of the entire brake system
and running gear.  Might be easier to just find a '71 bus to drive!
