Subject: Re: [T2] Steering goes "clunk"

> My '70 Westy has an annoying "clunk" as you turn the steering wheel to either side.  I checked all the front end and replaced the 
steering box with no success.  I notice that the sound seems to come from either the steering coupler or above in the steering column.  
The coupler seemed fine when I replaced the steering box but then again I didn't take it out and inspect it.  There is also a slight 2 inch 
play in the steering and I have been checking out the front end due to a floating of the front while 40+ mph.  Anyone have any 
suggestions?  Could the clunk and the floating be due to the same problem?  Anyone ever had this experience before?

Take off the belly pan and slide under the front while your friend operates the steering wheel, gently turning it back and forth just enough 
so you see the wheels turn a bit.  Now start at the steering box and look for play.  

Is the shaft coming out of the steering box moving relative to the pitman arm?  
Is the front ball joint of the drag link moving relative to the drag link?
Is the rear ball joint of the drag link moving relative to the swing lever?
Is either leg of the swing lever moving vertically?
Is either ball joint on the tie rods moving relative to the swing lever?
Is either ball joint on the outboard ends of the tie rods moving relative to the spindle lever?

If the answer to any of these is "yes", the appropriate part must be replaced or rebushed.

If the answer to all is "no", then you need to look at the wheel bearings or the steering coupler.
