Hello Volks,
In my continuing quest to find a restorable Westfalia to work on this =
winter, I stumbled across one located in Olympia, Washington.  I made the =
trip from Seattle (about 75 miles north) yesterday to look at it.  Its a =
white 1974 Westfalia with the green/blue plaid interior.  The bus hasnt =
run in two years but did prior to being parked.  The woman selling the bus =
is the second owner and has lots of service records.  The 1800 engine is =
all there including that crazy looking smog pump afterburner thing.  Dual =
carbs.  Cranks but wont turn over.  Probably relatively easy to get it =
back on the road.  The best thing about the bus is the interior.  Almost =
perfect with excellent cushions, wood, and decent canvas.  Has all the =
curtains, bug net, childs cot, an exterior awning (aftermarket?) sink and =
ice box.  Needs new poptop seals and a good washing.  Has some bad rust on =
the rear quarter panels and along the base of the body beneath the slider =
door.  The rust is the only reason Im not interested but its tempting to =
buy for the interior alone although this bus would be perfect for someone =
who wanted it for its intended function and not for looks.  It would be a =
shame to part this bus out.  She is asking $500 bucks.  Her name is =
Melanie and you can reach her at 360-664-7593 (work) or 360-9437196.  If =
you have any specific questions let me know.  Tell her Chad sent you. =20
