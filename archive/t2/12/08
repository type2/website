The light is not for low oil level, it's for low oil pressure.  You can 
either ignore it, use thicker oil, set your idle up a little, or adjust 
your driving style so that the engine runs cooler.

I doubt there is anything wrong with your sender.  The new one may come on 
more often in fact since there is some debate as to whether or not 
aftermarket senders illuminate at higher pressure than the factory sender.

>can anyone provide me with some critical info about this procedure?

Yeah, be VERY careful not to cross-thread the sender during 
installation.  It is very easy to do and the consequences are dire.  Don't 
overtighten!  But again, I think replacing the sender is going to be a 
waste of your time.
