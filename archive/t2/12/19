I'm between company cars.  When the Dodge Stratus (40 years from now will 
this be a collectable?) comes in the daily driver 81 Westy will go.

I thought I would mention it on the list before listing it elsewhere.   2.0L 
fuel injected (compression in cylinders 90, 110, 110, 110).

The significant bad:

Dents in lower nose.  
Dents in both bumpers.
Couple of scratches here and there (someone has touched up with slightly 
non-matching paint)
Drips oil in the driveway.
No sliding door inside panel.
No mirror and retainer "ring" on passenger side.
Missing one table top (bracket is there).
Dash vents faded.
Carpet dirty (it's brown anyway).
Ashtray cover gone on dash.
Mission one hupcap.
Driver side dome light switch busted.

The good:

Runs fine. 
New tires (less than 1000 miles).
All cabinets in place (redid shelves in back cabinets).
All cushions in place.
Canvas decent.
New seals on pop up top and luggage holder (put on since photograph).
No rust of any consequence.
Curtains all there.
Brakes good.
New dampers on back hatch.

Located in Athens, Alabama.  Will be starting at $2250 for it.  If you need 
more pics, let me know.
