The wire that should connect to the head temp sensor
on the 1979 engine in my 75 bus is grounded to the
engine tin.  I bought a new sensor and then discovered
that there is no place in the tin for it to go.  Tin
all looks proper, no odd holes anywhere, so I think it
is proper for the 79 engine.  I have to start the bus
3 or 4 times to get it to run--it runs a second or two
each time, until finally after 3 or 4 time, it finally
keeps running.  Next time i need to take the engine
out I will, of course, look and see if the head has a
spot for the sensor.  Until then, I guess I will live
with it, or perhaps put a pushbutton momentary contact
switch at the dash so I can temporarily have a
resistance in the circuit for starting purposes. 
Haven't tried it yet, though.
