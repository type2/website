Subject: Re: [T2] oil sender - thanks & more questions...

I think I'd get an oil gauge and put it on before I freaked out.
You should have between 4 and 7 PSI at idle speed and at least 21 PSI psi
at 2500-3000 rpm at operating temperature.
I've got a new type IV engine and if my RPMs drop down to 400 rps at stop
lights my light flickers although my gauge is showing 10 psi or more. If
I keep the idle up to specs 800-900 the light does not come on.
Senders are sold in different bar trigger pressures so be sure you're
getting the right sender. FLAPs just hand you about anything that will
fit the hole (even VW specialty parts stores).
