>>Can someone give me the size, width, bolt pattern, and offset of the 70's 
bus wheels.<<

i'm pretty sure it depends on what year your bus is.  all of the info is
in Bentley if i remember correctly.

if you dont have a Bentley i'll look in mine tonight when i go home.
i just need to know what year your bus is.

HTH.
