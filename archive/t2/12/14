Subject: Progressive carb icing

BTW George, you didn't mention that icing can't occur at real low temops
because there is so little moisture in the air to condense.
--My 71 now in the woods still has a progressive "Pinto" carb on it,
bolted to the stock manifold via an adaptor. Never had icing problems. 
I made a bottom plate for the narrow air cleaner, and a top plate with 6
springs coming from little eyebolts.  This lets you slide the top on and
clip it down. I made a manual choke that cabled from the wall behind the
driver back to the carb.   My milage didn't change, but my "get on the
ramp" acceleration was great when I floored it.
