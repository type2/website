Subject: 1980 weekender? No stove, heater, propane?

Hi again,

I just drove a van with the description above...was owned by the local
mechanic for years, then worked on by the next most local best
mechanic...but it doesn have the stove heater propane...

I think this was just discussed...but I didn't read those posts.

What are the options for a stand alone stove and heater? These folks put a
coleman on athe stainless next to the sink.

Otherwise there seems to be more room ...

Thanks,

Andree
