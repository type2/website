Bob, Al, and List
Not sure about all that. I use the traditional Muir way of valve adjustment, 
TDC for #1, adjust, 180CCW, adjust#2, 180CCW, adjust#3, 180CCW, adjust#4. 
Maybe its CW, can't remember right now, but I check the book each time. This 
IS correct, right? I know there is the method of watching the intake/exhaust 
for a cylinder go up down each, then wait for an easy spot, turning CW, but 
the Muir degree method seems to work well for me. Al, are you saying I 
should adjust intake and exhaust for a particular cylinder?
