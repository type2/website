Subject: Re: [T2] more questions on oil pressure sender replacement

Joel:
When replacing the oil strainer screen, be SURE not to overtighten the bolt in
its center. It's only tightened to about 7 ft-lbs and overtightening will BREAK
OFF the stud!
If the oil pressure switch is not leaking, I'd skip it. It's quite difficult to
get to on a 72 (the only year with type 4 engine and no access cover.)
Do number 2 in David Schwarze's list- put in thicker oil.
The owners' manual says 40w straight weight oil at all outside temps over 70 F.
I cannot emphasize this enough. Is it over 70 where you are? This is NOT 10w-40
nor 20w-50. Those oils all break down to their base viscosity once they have
been hot. IOW, 10w or 20w oil.
Synthetic will stand up better, but I'm not a fan. Too much money and too much
tendency to leak.
I'm quite pleased with Shell Rotella 40w truck oil recently.
