Not sure, but it will make things a whole lot easier.  It takes almost no 
time to do:

1.  Pull the cap off (leaving the wires attached) and put it to the 
side.  Also remove the coil wire from the cap if necessary.

2.  Remove the condensor wire from the "-" side of the coil.

3.  Loosen and remove the 13mm nut holding the distributor clamp to the 
engine case, and the flippy washer underneath the nut.

4.  Pull the distributor upward while lightly twisting counterclockwise on 
the rotor to help it along.  Set the distributor aside in a clean spot.

5.  Immediately plug the distributor hole with a clean paper towel.

Get a good source of light in there and stick your head all the way into 
the hatch until it's right over the sender.  You won't have a problem 
seeing what your doing at that point.

I still doubt there is anything wrong with your sender though.

The grass is always greener I guess - I almost never use my access hatch.
