WARMERS

Backwoods Solar is a reputable company that heas been
dealing in solar electricity for small (home-sized)
systems for perhaps 20 years.  I have friends that
have used these 12 volt bedwarmers for years and are
pleased with them.  They are supposed to be used under
you in a bed, not over, and may not be exactly what is
needed to keep warm in single seats, but could be used
with a bench seat.
