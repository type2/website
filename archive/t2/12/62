Hello all.....I'm new to the list as of yesterday.

I am now the proud second owner of a very well preserved '72 passenger =
bus. The only thing is that it's got an upright 1600 in it with nothing =
sealing off the engine compartment. I've had a '72 in the past with the =
same situation in which i cut out sheet metal to fit in the engine =
compartment (don't really want to do that again). I've heard a rumor =
that there is a part (made by VW) that fits into the engine compartment =
to seal it off. Apparently (if the rumor is true) late model bays in =
Europe had the option of a 2.0 litre or a 1600. If you opted for the =
1600, it had a drop in peice to make up for the extra space in the =
engine compartment. Does anyone: (1) have one (2) know the name of it =
(3) know where it might be available (4) have any contacts in Europe =
that may have info on it
