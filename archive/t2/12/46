Greetings.

I am new to this list

I used to do a fair amount of knuckle busting on Beetles, but am somewhat
out of the loop, especially concerning Type 2 models.

Any opinions as to what the best model year would be for an air cooled
Westy? 

I understand that VW was making air cooled models up into the 80's. Are
there any advantages to getting a Vanagon, as opposed to the older style
bus? And at the risk of getting a little off topic, are the water cooled
models as reliable as the air cooled mills? Lots of questions I know.
So.....

TIA,

Neil.
