I think this global statement goes for lots of topics heres. Many of us are
new at the game and need as much information as possible on what/how we can
do with our buses. For instance, it was posted the other day that you can't
use a propane stove at 8000 feet elevation.

Number one, it has little to do with buses, number two, I've used them at
11,000 feet.

So let's let the information flow, and thanks to all who contribute.
