Subject: metal shavings in oil

I found three small metal shavings in my oil strainer (not attracted to a
magnet).  Is an occasional shaving of this nature in the oil strainer normal
or at least acceptable? Another question: Does the strainer use only one
gasket on a '72 1700cc engine? I saw only one, but the gasket kit came with
two.

Thanks
