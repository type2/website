That rumour is true.  I have such a '72.  And a '74, a '77, and
a '78, now that I come to think of it.  ;-)

Not really.  There was just different sheetmetal attached to the
engine than that of pre-72 Buses and Bugs, to close the larger
engine bay and seal with the normal post-71 engine seal.

Tricky.  Might be available through dealers here in Germany.
Used, no.  I'd have to look around for a set.

Engine sheetmetal for Type 1 engine in 72-79 Type 2.

See above.

I am such a contact.  If you can't find any contacts closer to
you, p-mail and we'll work out the details.

Airhowlingly yours, 
   Erik.
