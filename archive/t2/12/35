Well I've been lagging but enough is enough, no-one has come through
to take it.  FWIW I will cut the roof off the van at the pillars and strap it
to your van if you help and bring me a gallon of gas for the generator and
5 good bimetal sawz-all blades.  But it is going Saturday afternoon.  Any
takers, please take it.  The pics are somewhere, who knows check the
archives.  If nobody takes it can the guy who wanted the luggage rack
drop me a line again, it's yours.

This isn't a bad pop-top folks, and all the lenses are there, some of the
interior cabinets are OK, the new spindles and rotors are gone from it.
Come take the roof or the whole van, either way you got to be in
Clarksburg, WV this Saturday morning.  I've seen tops not much better
sold for $300.  Email is best way to get ahold of me.
