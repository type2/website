Subject: [T2] Oil pressure senders

While we're on the subject, I recently installed a VDO oil pressure gauge in
my bus (71 DP doghouse dual relief).  I used the VDO dual sender (has
outputs for both the gauge and the original light).  Previous to that OP
light never came on at idle.  Now, it always comes on at idle when the oil
is hot.  The VDO dual sender is marked 8-10 psi.  According to the gauge, my
HIOP is about 5 psi, so that explains why the light is on at idle.  This is
moderately annoying to me, but not cause for serious worry at this point.
Does anyone know if there is a VDO dual sender that has a lower trip point
for the light output?
