Subject: oil sender - thanks & more questions...

first i want to thank everyone who has replied.  i needed confidence
& the list delievered.

last night i did NOT replace the sender, but i will probably attempt it
this evening. i doubt that is the problem at this point but i figure
it wouldnt hurt to replace it anyway.

following the advice of a few list memebers, i DID change the oil in
order to inspect the oil screen for metal shavings.  unfortunately, i
did find a few shavings on the screen.  i got pretty p.o.'ed at
that point.  i was almost ready to take Doc Ric's approach & 
"set the d*mn thing on fire".  i was just frustrated, but am feeling
much better today.

so...a search of the archives on the subject of metal shavings in oil
did not deliver good news.  i would assume at this point i have a
bearing going bad somewhere inside the motor...?

i decided to take the bus out for a spin & the idiot light did
NOT flicker at all. (a watched pot never boils, right?)

so...my question is at this point...do i need to stop driving my
bus immediately?  i'm thinking i will do another oil change in
about another week or so just so i can look at that screen again &
see whats up.

i will also be switching to 40wt oil.  had to put 30wt last night b/c
thats all i had at the house.

thanks again everyone.
