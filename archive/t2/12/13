Subject: more questions on oil pressure sender replacement

ok i'm getting frustrated at this point.  i did manage to find the sender -
it was hiding behind my distributor.  however, i can't really see what i'm
doing.  i know the answer is probably yes, but do i need to remove the
distributor to change the sender?

additionally, i can even get a socket into the hole over the sender anyway?
do i also need to remove the tin surrounding it in order to get a wrench or
socket around the hex part of the sender?

again:  72 bus, 1700 cc motor

i'm getting ready to change the oil, filter & screen.  i want to check the
screen for any metal bits/shavings etc. (thanks Sean!)
