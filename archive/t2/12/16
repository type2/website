Joel,

What is your idle at?

I had a number of problems with my hot oil pressure dropping below the
idiot light threshold which turned out to be directly related to the idle
dropping too low.

(the idle dropping too low was in turn related to a host of other 
problems
which I won't go into).  This would often happen after just coming down a
hill or otherwise.

so, you might want to check on your idle speed the next time you see
the problem occur (pull over, put a brick on the gas to keep your idle up
and oil light off, get out the tach, hook it up, run back or have your 
friend remove
the brick, note that light is on or off, run to the engine compartment 
and
check idle...)

HTH,
	-t
