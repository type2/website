Advantages:
Highway speeds on Vanagon , 70-75 MPH.
More roomy inside.
Big hatch over engine, I've installed pistons, cylinders, heads through
this gaping hole.
Sometimes cheaper that the real Splitties or Bays that are often
collectors vehicles.
Cheap body and interior parts off all those WaserBoxers that are sitting
in junk yards waiting for a 3000$ motor.
Good type IV engines are good for 2000K if you take care of them.
Cooling fan mounted on end of crankshaft, not belt driven.
Heavier vehicle, handles crosswinds and 18 wheel wash better.
