Subject: Hello List - Looking for part.

Hello List,

Well I finnaly got the bus in the shop. Got all the electrical, tune-up,
brakes, fuel lines and stuff done. In the process though it I found out that
the PO had rigged the front beam. I guess it was broken by an accident. Its
"fixed" for now but I would really like to find a replacement. If anyone has
a whole front beam they would like to sell please let me know. If not, does
anyone know where to get one of these? It is for a 71 Campmobile.

Cheers,

Joe
71 Campmoblie - SkiBus
