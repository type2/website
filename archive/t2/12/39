Actually you are totally RIGHT DAN!
  I had no idea what they were when I got them because they didn't have =
three sockets in each housing so I was confused....it was supposed to be =
the whole kit, but I had the lenses already.

  Anyway you and Erin both caught me on that one!
  Here is what Erin emailed me:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

"I saw your post come over the t2 list and so I went to your website.  =
The
  lights and seals at the bottom of the page are actually tail light =
housings
  for buses from 1963 to 1971 and not for bugs.  Matter of fact, they =
would
  work on my bus, Rob's bus, and Bryant's to name a few."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

So I definitely stand corrected!
  (but I still got the wrong housings/sockets etc. dangit!
I am looking for sockets and housings for rear tail lights for a 1974 =
bus, they sent me the early ones, sheesh)

So the saga continues,, ahhhh without pain there is no pleasure and =
without darkness there is no light.
I must remind myself of this in times like this. :o)

  Happy Smiles and Waves to all!
