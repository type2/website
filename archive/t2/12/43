Sounds like the shift coupler is bad.. either the rubbe
bushing or the shaft is broke loose where it mates with the
cage. Make sure you clean it off a bit before trying to see
if the coupler is following the shifter. Mine broke at the
shaft/cage juncture. So the rubber looked good and the slop
wasnt real noticable untill I cleaned the coupler off. Then
it was obvious that the shaft was not following the cage in
rotation.

  I came to a light & went to downshift & the thing would
not go into 2nd. gear. I finally got it to go &....  This
got worse as I got closer to home.  When I backed into the 
driveway it did not want to go into reverse without
grinding. </snip>
 
OK Tim... enlighten me here... what does the brake fluid
reservoir have to do with shifting... did I miss something
in the post?? BTW Tim, we caught close to a hundred bass
(mostly small) on Orcas island. Thanks for the tip!

  There is plenty of brake fluid in the reservoir.
