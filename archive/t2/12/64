I agree with everything that Kevin said but wanted to add my own two 
cents.  The most important thing to think about is, "What are you going to 
do with this bus?"  My opinions follow.

If you're primarily going to restore it and drive it to shows, go for a 67 
or earlier split window.
If you're going to drive it frequently, get a post-67 (including Vanagon) 
as visibility and ride quality are vastly improved.
If you're going to camp frequently, get a Vanagon as it has the most 
intelligent interior layout and most interior room.
If you're concerned about long-term reliability, get a fuel-injected model 
(75-later or 74 automatic).

The earlier the model, the more nostalgic it is obviously and the more 
attention it will draw.
As a general rule, the later the model, the more 
powerful/comfortable/reliable it is.
You'll have to balance those last two depeding on what is most important to 
you.

For myself, I primarily wanted a bus to camp in, so I picked one with an 
interior that I liked (Safare highroof).  I ruled out Vanagons because my 
nostalgia-quotient is moderately strong - only a bay or split would be 
acceptable.  I had to rule out splits though because of their harsh ride 
and lack of interior space.  Since I average about 12,000 miles per year in 
my bus, I also wanted reliability and economy.  I had to sacrifice that 
initially as my bus has dual carbs, but I am collecting parts for a FI 
conversion.

If you care more about decent heat, power and a quiet engine than 
nostalgia, consider one of the 2.1l Vanagons (86 and up I believe).  Make 
sure it has been meticulously maintained and pay careful attention to the 
radiator fluid and cylinder heads.  I know many people who are long-term 
owners of this setup and are happy with it.
