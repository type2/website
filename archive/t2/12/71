If you've seen this is was a real unsafe fitment the patterns are about 5mm
off on the circle, close but not what I'd ride on.  My tow dolly runs the
small
ford truck pattern and I looked at it pretty closely.  This is a widely
debated
subject on vanagon particularly for oversize wheels.  AFAIK the only easily
available fitments are 80's MBZ, 80's large Audi, and oddly a recent favorite
somebody drug up perhaps the Merkur Scorpio.  And of course the stock
Vanagon alloys.  Most people are looking towards a 15" alloy to run big
tires on their syncros and go with the Audi 5000/100 wheels or apparently
now the Merkur thing though I've never personally seen that.  There are scores
of odd aftermarket alloys from the 70's and early 80's that you will see now
and then as well.  The vanagon alloys are a real nice look and are coming
down now days if you look hard enough and want the same diameter as
stock.
