Subject: Turn Signal Switch

Howdy,
    I was driving to work yesterday in my bus and the after turning a
corner I noticed that my turn signal switch was just kinda sitting there
kinda floppy.  I am not sure what broke.  It would turn the signal on
when I worked it around a bit but not anymore.  I am looking for a
replacement switch.  I am in Indianapolis and it would seem that the
turn signal switch is hard to find.  Does anyone in the Indianapolis
area know where I might find the turn signal switch for a 76 bus?  It's
my daily transportation and my arm is getting hit by bugs when I have to
signal for a turn  =P

Any help locating a turn signal switch would be greatly appreciated.
You can email me direct to avoid spamming the group.
Thanks,
