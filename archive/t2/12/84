15/32 inch SAE vacuum hose fits very nicely.  There is a metric hose for this, but it was horribly expensive when I tried to buy it.  The 
15/32 inch hose fits perfectly and is still in good shape 10 years after installation.  Since it isn't cloth covered, the resto purists won't like 
it, but for my driver it has served fine.
