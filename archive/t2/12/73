If it's the offset, causing a clearance problem at the rear, then it's also
not correct for the front either. Those Hondas running around with the
wheels sticking out the fender wells are a prime example of what not to
do...The suspension is designed with a certain offset that puts the cen-
terline of the wheel and tire between the inner and outer wheel bearings.
Change that line, with adaptors or wheels that protrude, and you're add-
ing undue stress to the outer bearing and also making the lug bolts and
nuts work a LOT harder than they were intended to. The extra width
(track) of the front end also puts a strain on the steering box, making
parking and low speed manuvering that much harder.
