Pat, this sounds like the rubber pads in your shift yoke are torn.  This is
an easy and cheap fix, if that's the problem.  Scoot under and look just
forward of the tranny.  You should see a little y shaped piece with square
rubber pads in each of the arms of the Y.  This connects to the shift rod.
You'll know how to undo it by looking at it.  These parts are available for
all bus years.  I don't know if the a/c vanagon years used the same part.
Should cost less than $20 if that's what it is.  Remember to safety wire the
set screw.

Regards,

Grant
