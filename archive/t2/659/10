Subject: Re: [T2]Less expensive cd player?

Hit the junkyards b/c the factory stereos sell cheap. I have a Hyundai CD stereo that got replaced by a friend who just wanted more power and flashy lighting. Sounds fine. 

Do you have a cheap AM/FM radio? 

Go to the store and buy an FM Modulator that connects to anything that has an earphone jack. We listened to an MP3 audiobook in our '97 VW Cabrio last night through ours on our way to Fall Creek Falls for the monthly Upper Cumblerand Corvair club meeting. 

Was about $20 and I see them on the auction sites for $10. There is a nicer digital version for $30 new and $20 on the auction sites. The original non-digital tuner version will broadcast to 4 channels in the FM88 range. The digital tuner will do ANY FM channel. A plus in crowded big cities where the FM dial is full. 

Runs for hours and hours on AAA batteries. The digital tuner version has a cigarette lighter adapter. 

Belkin makes them. I run AAA Ni-MH batteries in mine and have a 12 volt charger I bought from www.partsexpress.com for $8 a while back. Takes a long time to use these batteries up with an hour here and there of usage. I use the charger to charge AA and AAA batteries. My C and D size I charge in the house on an OLD charger I bought in 1990. 

Recommendation - make or buy a short headphone extension cord from Radio Shack for better reception. The headphone jack cord is the antenna. We don't need it but it would help. Ours has a 25 foot range or so. A passing car can recieve the broadcast and I can hook it to our stereo/computer in the house and listen on the car stereo outside while I wash and wax the car. That's how I handle MP3s.
