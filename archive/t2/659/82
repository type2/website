Joe,

I tend to try the inexpensive fixes first.  I'm also 48 years old and have a
brain.  I've got more sense than to ever get under any vehicle to work on
the starting system, with it in gear and not chocked to prevent movement.
Sorry to hear about your bud.

I'll check out the relay kit to make sure I have it hooked up correctly.
Then I'll test the starter.

You need to reconsider your "bedside" manner, "Doc".  Seriously.
