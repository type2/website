Subject: RE: [T2] Air conditioner unit - under dash - overhead unit for

Thanks for the tip. It does look like it could be a pain. I have a brand new
overhead unit and am also looking at a smaller overhead unit. I am not sure if
I can fit the smaller unit in my westy, but I am hoping. I have a pop top. The
unit I have is like a T and will not work, so I am going to have to sell it.

It is a NOS unused T shaped unit. Complete with cover for hoses on the door
pillar. Supposed to be complete. It has never been used or installed. It came
to me in the original box that is was packaged in 1978. Make an offer if
anyone is interested. I am located in Madison, VA. I have around $200 in this
unit right now.
