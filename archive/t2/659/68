Subject: Re: [T2] 71 only oil bath thermostat

 Steve asked:
 
is there a chance anybody has a working thermostat that hooks into the oil
bath cleaner on the 71 only.  i have the oil bath, need the thermostat.
prefer trade, can do cash.  fweemingly,  steve

 Well...... yes and no..... I have one but I would have to take it off a
 complete 71-only air cleaner :)

if that's what you want to do. i wouldn't though... and i can't let you.
take it out of the envelope!
but maybe there's a bright listee that had no storage and just kept some of
those little devils, and bought a fuel injected ride, and what to do with a
drawer full of oil bath thermostats?   - steve, now collecting.
