What an excellent development!

Why not just stick with the stock wiring? It's relayed.

I don't know about danger, unless you run the same risk as a leaky
rear hatch in sucking exhaust fumes. But anyway, the point of ducting
cabin air is that your heater will run hotter if you reheat cabin air
instead of having to heat cold outside air. If you don't run a duct,
you will lose this benefit.

This is correct. There are plastic parts in the stock blower too.

There are additional factors involved in having a warm bus. My heater
blows good and hot, but I have so much cold air coming in through bad
door and window seals that we freeze when it gets more than moderately
cold. For additional tips on insulating, exhaust wrapping, and
sealing, see the library and Richard's site.

Have fun,
