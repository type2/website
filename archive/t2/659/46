maybe I'm a little dense, or just tone deaf, but putting decent speakers
in a bus is kinda like putting em in a big empty tin can, the bus would
need about 500lbs of sound deading materiel for it to make much
difference. listen to NPR or talk radio on the tinny speaker and tune
into the sound of the flat four singing in the back

hight bob you are correct except for my bus i gutted and tottally insulated flooring with insulation board and recarepeted as well as the walls are insulated behind the panels.... she is quiet cozy but at times scary cause even with the radio off you can barely hear the engine purrrrrring... its really quiet cozy though...

before this yes it did sound rather lets say like hollering through a giant aluminum can LOL

peace and love
