I'm obviously accessing the list with my computer, I'm running Red Hat 9
and using Mozilla or Pine to read my mail.

I would recommend Fedora Core 2 to a beginner, or the K12LTSP version
which is much more versitile but a little more complicated,  an easy way
to get started is to use Mozilla or Firefox for internet and
OpenOffice.org for you word processing in windoze to make the easy
transition.

and we should probably take this off list as we are pushing even the
Friday limits..  but for bus content, I couldn't keep my bus running
without my linux computer getting me access to this list....
