the part thru WVa is steep and has lots of large coal trucks on it, I've
driven it in my bus and some grades are 20mph specials...it also has some
pretty tight turns too.   check brakes and make sure engine is in top
shape,

and if you are inclined "Timberline" ski slope just off the road is worth
the side trip
