Subject: Working Thermostat - was "What is this part?"

Thanks to everyone who responded. I got the part back where it belongs. 
It must have been poked out by the thermostat pushrod the last time I 
reinstalled the fan shroud. The purpose of the last engine removal was 
to install working flaps and pushrod so I could get a functional 
thermostat system (the flaps were previously held open all the time and 
there was no pushrod). The thermostat is now installed and adjusted and 
I drove it around yesterday for the first time. What a difference. Just 
driving around the neighborhood I get more air and hotter air through 
the defroster after just a few minutes than I used to get at highway 
speed. It was a worthwhile project.

 From a '71 bus with stock 1600 DP upright. I had my hand up in the area 
around the thermostat and this dropped out. Does anyone recognize it?

Thanks,
