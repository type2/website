Subject: NGK plug for FI bus?

I just spent some time in the archives, and, as usual, am now totally 
confused.  I want to get some NGK plugs that will play nice with my new 
CHT sender, but, which ones?  I've seen recommended (for winter):

BPR5ES
BR5ES
B5ES

R=resistor, when would one not want a resistor plug?
P="projected," what does this mean?

Thanks!  I'll check back later.  Now it's on to the hardware store for 
OP gauge install odds n' ends.

best,
