Jason,

ok, this points out why it is difficult to do help over the net<grin>.

If someone actually "heard" the engine start, they might 
say...Whoa!...your starter is just *not* turning th engine over fast 
enough to really get it going quickly....Had this problem with a 
F**d...replaced the battery and it started in about 1/2 of a crank.

Obviously, you have already replaced your battery, so that is probably not 
the cause...what about the wires and cables going to your 
starter?...cleaned/tightened?

The test I suggested yesterday(the starter fluid) will tell you a whole 
lot about what is going on very easily....

If you use it and the engine starts "more instantly"....then the 
starter/battery is probably not the cause....something on the fuel side is 
probably not working well.  So, with one or two squirts, you can diagnose 
a whole lot of stuff.

You **did** see the very nice link to how much battery power is required 
thru bad cables vs. good cables that Richard posted last week???

Sample scenario...starter is pulling so much from the battery that the 
fuel pump can't push fuel correctly.  The test?  Pre-load the fuel ring by 
using the pencil on the afm flapper trick.  *Then* try and start.

Cheers, dave
