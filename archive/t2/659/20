Thanks for all the input and replies.

Well, I chose what seemed like being the warmest day to get the job 
done and went to it.
Of course it ended up being freezing cold and windy out on the street 
but what can you do when you don't check if your Safare top fits in the 
garage before you buy a house, seems like I deserve it.

Regardless, got everything apart no problem, pulled all the tubes (kept 
everything organized in a box with a towel in it), they don't look 
anything as bad as I thought they would. I then embarked on what would 
actually be the longest part, cleaning the darn things, man they were 
dirty near the ends with loads of red silicone on them.

Ultimately other than being really dirty and most of my time being 
spent cleaning everything from tubes to the surrounding area, it all 
went off without a hitch. Prepped the clean tubes inside, braved the 
cold again and slid them all into place, reassembled (dang that fiddly 
spring, my poor fine motor skills and numb fingers) did the valve 
adjustment and sparked her up & took her for a spin.

Not a leak in sight. Well worth the effort and cold. Its lovely to see 
things so drip free.
So, Thanks again to everyone for their words of wisdom !
