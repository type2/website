Subject: Higher Amp Alternator alternatives?

Does anybody know of a higher amperage alternator for the type 4 motor?  I
know the options are probably limited as the alternator is enclosed by the
engine tin.  I am in need of an alternator and I am afraid that 55 amps
are not enough.

On my EA-81 equipped Subaru Hatchback, I was able to install a chevy 65
amp alt that I converted to 105 amp fairly easily and with no real
fabrication needed.  Is there anything similar for the bus?

Thanks,
