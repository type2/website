Subject: horn/light relay

I'm looking for a simple relay, hoping that it is hidden somewhere on 
the BD website.  I am installing an air horn on Lurch, due to its 
apparent invisibility.  What I would like to do is install a splittie 
dimmer switch in the floor so that I can switch back and forth between 
the two horns.  The original horn works on the bench only.  I adjusted 
it per Bentley, but when hooked up to the original wiring, it does not 
work.  Sooooo....  I need the relay to apply more juice to the horns.  
It would be nice to get both electrical devices from the same source.  
I tried Pep Boys just down the street, but $$$$$.
