Subject: Re: [T2] What is this part??

Fits it the bottom of the head. Included in factory heads and factory 
rebuilds but not in Brazilian heads. I recently removed a set from some old 
SP heads to put into a new set of SP Brazilian heads. The thermo rod passes 
through the  slot. I assume that head cooling is aided by these pieces or 
the factory would not have included them. They are held into the heads by 
"wedging" so it is not surprising to see one fall out if it had been 
transferred from a factory head.
