I'm still rabidly anti- MS/Windoze/Gates from my Atari days, but have
since been captured and held my WinXP in my Athlon "Tower". Since it's
Friday maybe some of you have suggestions how I can be "rescued" and
get into Linux. (Bus content: I need my computer to access Type2.com!)

A couple of years ago a friend sent me a couple of Linux
distributions, neither of which would work. Now I purchased
Lindows/Linspire 4.5, but it is unstable too. Linspire customer
support been working with me a over a month now. Don't know if we are
getting anywhere...
