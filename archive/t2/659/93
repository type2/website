Then we should start calling all solenoids relays, or all relays 
solenioids, I suppose? Look, you started off the last post by saying 
that the WR 1 "masks" another problem. And you're right about that. But 
don't mix terms. When people use the word "solenoid" they mean that 
thing on the starter. And when they say "relay" they mean a device that 
keeps high amperage from passing through switches on the dashboard (and 
other electrical tasks). Don't mix these up to make a point.

Many people on this list drive buses in sub-optimal condition. I'd much 
rather they toss in a WR-1 and spend their money on replacing fuel line 
or maintaining breaks than to worry about all the faults that could 
cause hard starting -- including a suboptimal solenoid -- first.
