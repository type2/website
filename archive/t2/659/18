Subject: Hard Starting -- Lunchtime Test

Hi Folks,

A few minutes ago, I went outside on my lunch hour and ran a test on my Bus: 
  I pulled the air cleaner off, switched the ignition on, and pushed on the 
AFM flap for 5 seconds.  The fuel pump ran (smoothly and quietly -- good for 
an original) and pressurized the fuel rail.  I then tried to start the 
engine as normal (clutch in, E-brake on, no brake, no gas).  Eight pulses 
later, the engine caught and fired on the first try.

So, now I'm looking at the double relay to see if it's suspect.  If it's not 
running the fuel pump during starting, it makes sense that the engine would 
be hard to start.  At the very least, now I can manually run the fuel pump 
to prime the system until I get it fixed.

Thyanks again for the help, I'm getting there...
