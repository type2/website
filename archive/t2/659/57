Hi Mark,

I woulld suggest you give the bus to someone in Maine. Pay them to 
maintain and insure it for you, and to rent it on your behalf to others 
when you don't need it. Make the bus the property of a company you own 
and they work for. Or something like that.

This way your bus won't need to return to CA for smogging. And the 
rental income will pay for maintenance and upkeep.

If you would like to keep a bus in Toronto, you can get to Maine from 
here in about 14 hours driving. I'd be happy to manage your bus if 
you'd like to keep one here.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
