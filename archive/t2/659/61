Subject: 76 Bay

I've just been given a 76 Bay.  It has been sitting since 96.  Interior seems
OK, body is a diff. story of course.  First thing , all the locks -including
the engine are impossible to open.  Think it will be a gull wing before long,
as the sliding door fell off as I was fiddling with it.
What kind of engine will it have???  Once penetrating oil works of course.?
Can't wait to find out.  Am sure some Guru here will know.

Now I'll have to spend the winter collecting tools and reading and rereading
my Bentley.

My square kids think I'm totally crazy.  One  (71Zanderbus) is enough for
them.  Think they are scared that  their on call babysitter will be busy next
summer.  They are correct.

Ginny in Winnipeg  wondering where to start.
