Yes, I've really been thinking about being careful about returning
barn-fresh buses to service. I was given one parts bus because the PO
had dropped a spark plug into the tin where it lodged between #3 and
#4, ultimately resulting in a seized #4, so I definitely plan on
paying more attention to cylinder area cleanliness in out-of-service
