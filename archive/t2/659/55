Subject: Anyone for a conundrum?

Suppose I were to drive a bus from San Diego to Maine and then leave it 
garaged in Maine. I fly back to California and go on with my life, but 
every year I go to Maine for a few weeks, take my bus out of storage, 
drive it and camp in it.

Where would I register it? It can't be registered in California after 
long, because I wouldn't be driving it back to be smogged. Could it be 
registered in Maine, even though I would have no other residence there 
but the bus itself?

I'll probably end up asking AAA this, but thought I'd see if any 
listees know the answer.
