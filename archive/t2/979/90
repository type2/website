no but at this stage of the game if it solves the problem....

that involves taking the cyl off I will put the old head back on before I
do that.   This is a 20k fix, the engine has 100k + already on the engine
so I had planned a rebuild soon, just have some house bills so don't have
the money right now or would do it now and be done with it....

nah mine won't do that and haven't figured a way to do it.

I am going to put gasket in, put head on and see if it holds presure, if
not going to stick the old head back on.  this is a daily driver and it
has been too long off the road now. my wife wants her car back....

better is the enemy of "good enough" and at this stage, "good enough" is
good enough.

thanks
