Subject: Bus motor replacement

Ok, in the thread of silly questions..
I just found a complete bus motor (with FI) on craigslist this morning with 
new heads. It came out of a 1981 bus, I dont know details yet because my 
call hasnt been returned, but I assume it to be a 2.0l. I am considering 
putting this in my 72 westy for the timeb eing because if it is complete and 
serviceable it is cheaper then a set of fual carbs which my bus currently 
needs. The guy I bought the bus from took the carbs off hte motor before i 
pcked it up for his next VW project, and I just need to get this thing on 
the road. So anyways, between a 72 and 81 the motors are still essentially 
the same right? the 72 has the original motor in it currently which was 
apparantly rebuilt some 20k miles ago but I want a spare motor for both of 
my busses (already found a spare 2.0l for the 78 i bought for my son). 
Before I plunk down any money I just want to be sure that the larger 2.0l 
isnt a problem to fit into cavity in my westy once I get all the FI crap 
installed too. I would much much rather have carbs on it, since i want to 
keep it nearly completly stock with the exception of the flooring and 
paneling, but finances currently do not allow for that heh
