Darren,

This is one of the first speciality tools I bought 5 years ago:

I struggled with various Autozone rental tools until I used this one.  
One end is curved to protect the boots and the screw has a floating  
ball bearing that sits in the pocket the threaded end of the tie-rod  
which locks it in place. A few turns later "POP!".
