Subject: Blaupunkt radio polarity

I found a Blaupunkt Radio:

I googled for info and It appears to be a Blaupunkt Mannheim L AM/FM- 
modo radio.

The PO can't tell me anything about it. He thinks it's from an old  
Alfa Romeo but I can't tell if it's positive ground or negative.

I know some radios are configurable for 6V/12V and pos/neg ground but  
when I opened up this one I see no such adjustments.

Is there a safe way to test this radio?
