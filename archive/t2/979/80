it is indeed an AVP head I just got from them last week

which is how I installed them.

duh! yeah, I have a bunch of new head gaskets in a box in the garage I
suspect you are right and if I can get away with only pulling the head
enough to slip a "Couple" of them in there I will try that first, tighten
em down and see if that gets em "tight" I would be happy with 110 since
this engine will be rebuilt in 20-25k also.

heck I didn't even get an invoice in the box or a core return paper.
would have been nice to be told, or if expected they should have included
the gaskets or as you say at least mentioned they needed them.
