Hey Folks,
   I am getting out of the vw hobby.  I just had a
baby and have no time to finish the current camper. 
The engine is out, and 95% of the way finished with a
full rebuild. (needs FI system put back on, and
exhaust) I have all the parts to complete.  Camper is
orange/brown in color.  Basic camper model (no stove)
BRAND NEW TIRES!  $1700 OBO.  Email
lexluthier72(-at-)yahoo.com for photos.  Make me a
reasonable offer.  Camper is located in Mpls, MN. 
                                          -Erin R.
