Subject: RE: [T2] Grounding

Nathaniel,

The '68 doesn't have a wire-grounding system. It is a chassis ground system.
That means that the grounding wires actually ground to the small slip-on
post on the inside of the dash below the cluster cut-out.

The dash being metal, grounds through the 6 bolts on the sides and the 8 on
top of the windowsill. It is confusing. If you don't have the slip-on post,
just ground the wires directly anywhere on the dash or the firewall.

You will see that all of your turn signals, reverse lights and headlight
buckets also are missing ground wires. I think it is a '68-'69 thing only.

I've just swapped over the dash for my 68 SC and while everything goes
together quite nicely, I can't for the life of me find a grounding lug
anywhere. I've got these brown wires tying everything together, but nowhere
do they actually go to ground. In the bentley schematic they show it all
tying to ground after the emerg flasher switch, but it doesn't show the
physical location, and I can't find it. I imagine all type twos of this
vintage must be similar. Anyone know where I can find this?

Thanks
Nathaniel
