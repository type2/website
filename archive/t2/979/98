Subject: Dakota Digital oil temp sender/gauge

Does anyone know if its possible to install the Dakota Digital
oil temp sender in the taco plate?  Seems like the sender would
be too long. I've already had to shorten my dipstick with the
current VDO sender in there now. I'm not sure I trust it's reading.

My CH temps are usually between 350F and 400F around town. If I
go 65mph for short stints, my CH temps rise to 400F-430F but
quickly drop when I slow down to 60mph or come to a stop at a light.

However, my oil temp continues to rise. The other day the gauge
showed close to 250F oil temp, but my CH temps were 380F-400F.
When I got home, I immediately went to the engine compartment.
The engine did not seem hot. I could just about touch the engine
without burning my hand. I got a long stem thermometer and put
it in place of the dipstick and watched it rise to 220F in about
a minute. Turn ignition key ON and VDO gauge reads 220F. I dont see
how I can go from 250F to 220F in about 1-2 mins.

Oh, also, my VDO gauge will suddenly drop to 0 sometimes when it
is "hot". It just doesnt make sense for my oil temp to keep rising
while idling at a red light while my CH temps are dropping to
350F.

I'd really like a DD gauge/sender, but I'm afraid it wont fit.
