You can sling an ordinary bike rack up front - fixed or folding, the 
type that is held in place with taut webbing straps to gutters and 
bumper.

You wont want top straps to go over your windshield to a gutter, so 
hook them around the GRILL just below the windshield.  Take the grill 
out, cut a slot in the mesh. Placed 2 steel bars behind that for the 
gutter hooks, and to spread the load.   (my bars were about 6 inches 
by 1/2, and flat)

this held an adult bike for a few thousand miles, and both bike and 
rack are easily removed. I did not have the nose-tire, but this might 
clear it.

Bikes get awfully buggy though :)
