The 12V in shows + in.

My negative ground Frankfurt from the late 60s' is set up the same
way. Only the earlier radios tended to be switchable. The later
configs looked like the back of the one in your possession.
Alway shook up a speaker and preferably antenna when testing these.

anyway that one should be neg ground, unless there is a negative input
as well, which I have never seen.
