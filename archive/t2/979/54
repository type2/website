Subject: RE: [T2] saggin bus

Sam,

I ran into this with both my Double Cab and my '70 Deluxe and now both sit
within specs.

First, Both were wearing too tall rubber, which makes the front look high
and the rear low because of the rear lower fender line.

Second, both needed the rear torsion bar bushings replaced. 

Thirdly, both had gas charged shocks on the front. These push the nose up so
it looks out of whack. They don't push the rear up as much because of the
weight of the engine.

As a final solution, do the adjustment, but unless your bus has been loaded
with a ton of weight it's whole life, it will probably be the tires or the
worn bushings or gas charged shocks or a combination of all three.

Hope this helps,

Jon Stiles
