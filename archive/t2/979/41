Subject: [Q] VW Convertible Wanted

Group-

I'm going through withdrawal -- my bus restoration project is taking longer
than I had hoped (surprise!) and I am looking for something to drive in the
mean time.

What would be nice is a somewhat-early bug convertible (around '71 or so)
that is in decent shape.  Put another way, I don't need another project,
but I don't have to have a cream-puff either.  A decent pan, engine and top
would be nice in case I decide to keep it once the bus is done.

And of course, not too expensive would be nice.  O.K., O.K., I'm asking for
a bunch here but anyone gettin' out of the bug "business" that would like
to find a good home for their convertible?

BTW, I'm in North Alabama.  (I know there's guys South of me that might
have something.  Anyone listening?)
