Subject: 73 German Panel for sale

I have an unusual bus for sale.  It's a '73 Panel that was imported 
from Germany.  I't a bit rare to find a '73 panel and even more rare 
that it's a German model with a dual port 1600.

I have it listed for sale here:

I wanted to restore it, but I haven't had the time.
