Subject: Pilot Bearing Removal

Anyone with foolproof ways of removing a stubborn pilot bearing? 
Nothing ordinary has worked for me. I tried filling the area with grease 
and slamming in a dowel close to the ID of the bearing and 'pumping' it 
out but no go.  I am about to look for an appropriate dremel bit to help ...

TIA,
