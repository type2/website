Subject: RE: [T2] Pilot Bearing Removal

When I hydro (grease thing) a pilot bearing, I use a socket that is as close
as possible to the bearing bore.  I try to insure that there is NO AIR at all,
just grease.  This includes the socket.  Put grease in one end untill it comes
out the other end of the socket.  I'll either use a deep well or a regular
with a 4' extension.  Then I whack it a really sharp blow with a rubber
mallet.  If it still won't come out I've used a piece of rod with a sharp 90
on it, rounded off the end so it won't mar the bore too much, fishhook it in,
then clamp onto the rod with vise-grips and start tapping it with a hammer to
pull it out, working around the diameter.  Last ditch is dremel and chisel.JT
