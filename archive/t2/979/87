I think just because people are using them doesn't mean it's the right 
way to go.  Keep at it and figure out the real problem.  If there's a 
head-seating problem, use some valve grinding compound on the cylinder 
and mate it to the head properly.  There's a good overview of how to do 
this in the muir manual.  If you need more instruction on the technique, 
let me know.  I just bought new heads and my mechanic said I didn't need 
to do this because all the heads are machined perfectly, but I still did 
it because it really makes for a perfect match between the cylinder and 
head.

Also, depending on the model of your compression tester, you might be 
able to use it to do a leakdown test of sorts, without all the gauges 
and stuff (which really doesn't matter - you know there's a leak).  But, 
the point here is to find out exactly where.  If you have one that has a 
quick-disconnect, you can connect that to an air hose and apply pressure 
to your cylinder and find out exactly what's leaking.  Be very careful, 
though, if your cylinder is near TDC because it can spin the engine. 
Anyways, apply pressure, and listen for the leak at all the various 
spots (exhaust, intake, breather, etc).  You'll probably hear more than 
you heard while trying to crank over the engine.
