With 30psi compression I doubt there is a gross error such as a valve 
not closing.  30psi sounds like a problem with the rings, or a valve 
that is seating but was not ground properly, or the aforementioned 
barrel-sealing-against-the-head problem.

I recommend the standard oil-squirt test to determine whether it's rings 
or valves/barrels.
