A pickle fork should get it off. This will undoubtedly damage the part
and prevent its reuse but since you are replacing it give it a whack
(literally). You should be able to borrow one from most FLAPs for the
afternoon. The tie rod puller should work too (they have these at
Harbour Freight too if you've got one in your area).
