Subject: Grounding

I've just swapped over the dash for my 68 SC and while everything goes
together quite nicely, I can't for the life of me find a grounding lug
anywhere. I've got these brown wires tying everything together, but nowhere
do they actually go to ground. In the bentley schematic they show it all
tying to ground after the emerg flasher switch, but it doesn't show the
physical location, and I can't find it. I imagine all type twos of this
vintage must be similar. Anyone know where I can find this?

Thanks
Nathaniel
