Subject: RE: [T2] Backfiring, and popping,

Gonna sound wierd, but try a new muffler. If yours is pretty worn out it will
cause backfiring. On my 70 Bay I tried everything and after all was said and
done, a new muffler was the last thing I thought of to try and...... problem
fixed. At least in my case. Give it a shot. Good Luck!
