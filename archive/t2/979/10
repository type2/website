LOL.. I guess he didn't install the whistle eh? 

Was a NEW pilot bearing installed?
If not,, that is my guess... and if you keep driving it till the pilot 
bearing seizes on the input shaft,,, you won't be able to change gears 
properly,, and you will have a bugger of a time getting the engine off the 
trans to put a new one in. 

The pilot bearing is in the center of the flywheel on the engine. 

hope that helps
