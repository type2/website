Subject: Wires under the floor

Hey, I'm new to the mailing list and I question.  I'm restoring a 1971
camper that was given to me.  It's in great shape, but I decided to go ahead
and replace the flooring since it looked a little rotten around the sink
holes.  When I took the wood out I found a wire that runs from the engine
compartment, but mine is disconnected from whatever it goes to and I haven't
been able to find what they connect to.  There is a red and green wire and
they were taped to the floor with a protective sheath around them.  Does
anyone know what these go to?  There was no engine when I got it, so there
aren't any clues on that end.
Thanks for your help
-Brandon
