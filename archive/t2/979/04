Pure sniffer test. All they care about is what comes out of the
tailpipe. So since I was running with big vacuum leaks they had to set
the idle mixture to full rich, advance the heck out of the timing,
etc. If this was Cali, it never would have passed the mechanical
inspection. Here in CO they couldn't care less. In fact, the techs
were so busy taking pics of each other in my bus (not kidding) it
could have been blowing black smoke and still passed.
