One reg can handle both.  Get a Holley 1205 fuel pressure regulator, and a 0
to 50 pressure gauge.  Gut the fuel pressure regulator body removing the check
ball assembly.  Replace with a standpipe arangement, I use copper tubing, and
plane down the pipe with sandpaper glued to a piece of glass, smooth the edges
of the standpipe removing all burrs.  This will leave the little pipe flush
with the top of the body of the regulator.  Replace the top with the diaphram
and spring in place.  You now have a return style regulator.  Put the gauge on
your output side and you can dial the pressure in with the adjustment screw on
the top.  Total cost with gauge shouldn't be more than 30 bucks.  This setup
can also be boost refrenced for turbocharging/supercharging.  I don't know if
I still have the link for the mod, but if you wanted I'll set one up for you
and you just cover parts and postage. JT Beaufort, SC Running: 1. 62 404.1
