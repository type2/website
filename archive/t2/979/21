Subject: BUS FUSION - RIP

So .. those of you who didn't make it ... too bad .. it was maybe the best BF
yet .. the weather was pretty much perfect .. bit o' rain on Friday night but
both Sat and Sun were warm and sunny but not sun stroke warm and sunny.

Funny .. somebody tipped over a port-o-can .. and someone else stood it up ..
I'd really hate to go into one of those after it had been stood up .. yuck!

Also .. some guy had his boat and motor stolen in the middle of the night .. I
wonder if they actually started it or just pushed it out into the water ..
where it may have went over the falls ..

There were some very nice buses for sale .. a 66 hard top westy, a 78 with a
brand new paint job but sans engine and tranny .. Cory's shop did the work so
... I'd personally assume it was done properly, Ted's 75? .. the orange one ..
very cool bus, and a Vanagon (weekender?) solid body and a rear seat that
converted bed ..

So .. Frank says that he and his crew will not be putting on BF again .. he is
hoping someone else steps up but he made it pretty clear that he will not be
doing it next year .. he didn't completly close the door on the future but ..
it appears unlikely that he'll do it again. I wonder if the Embrun crowd
could move into that sort of thing ... that would be cool ..
