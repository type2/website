Subject: Re: [T2] Drag Link

go get you a tuning fork from auto store 10 bucks and lay that fork between the drag connection and the drag on both ends of connectors and hit with a hammer and it will budge loose..
  dont be hitting that thing directly or pri it or anything... 
  it will come loose...
  when reinstalling make sure to hook the back end first then you can adjust it and hook the front.,..
  good luck

  Uhggg! I ordered a new drag link to replace the clunking
one on there now. I can't get the old one off! I've tried
a puller, a hammer, liquid wrench. Nothing works. Won't
even budge. Any suggestions? I've ordered the tie rod
puller from germansupply.com. I'll try that when it gets here.
