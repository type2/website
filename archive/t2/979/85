Bob, even if you don't use head gaskets, you have to compensate by using
barrel shims between the cylinders and the case.  The FAQ gives information
on this.  Link, anybody??

What NEW compression are you reading with the other three cylinders??

If they are running about normal psi, and you haven't compensated for a fly
cut head, then the heads may not have been fly cut?!?!?

Did you lap the cylinders to the heads??  And did you use Prussian Blue to
confirm you had a good mating surface??  This would really show if the #3
cylinder upper fins were causing the cylinder-to-head mating surface to be
obstructed
