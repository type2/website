doubt if that small CR difference will cause any significant problems, it
was like that (unknowingly) for about the past 5-6 years anyway. when I
took it down. 3&4 didn't have gasket.  1&2 did. so effectively it will be
no change than the way it was.  (I replaced 3&4 some years ago and didn't
put a gasket in not realizing that 1&2 had it)
