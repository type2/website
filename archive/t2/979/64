Subject: Re: [T2] hole in Tin.

Bob, on my engine that was the hole for the temperature sender when it was buried underneath the tin.  I think the early years were like that.  I've got a CB engine that has that very same hole you describe.  I don't know its history, but I do know at one time, on some type IV engines, the head temperature sender was buried underneath the tin and in the head near the #3 sparkplug....a design that was fixed in later years.  Is it possible that your bus has early tin on it?  Greg
