Subject: wtb: 1960-1967 Bus for store display

I am posting this for a fellow who has been by here a fair number of times.. 
I havn't managed to meet up with him as he comes by when I am not at home,,, 
my daughters have taken his information. 

He is looking for a Store display.. the artwork he left is from Campus Crew
Nick Rizzo
519-757-7319
looking for a '60 - '67 Type 2 Bus,, even though the picture shows a westy 
in full camping gear inside the store.... 

the phone call messages he has left indicate , no engine or trans is 
require.. but the body has to be restored and he wants the interior 
presentable as well.. 

Let him know if you have something.
