Subject: Not another Bus

Hello my name is Shawn, and I am a Bus Addict. Just
kidding, I am not ready to admit I have a problem.

OK today I just purchased another bus. Now this makes
4. It is a 1978 standard bus. I bought it for the
motor. It has a strong running 2000cc F.I. motor. I am
going to put the motor in my last bus purchase. My
1975 Riviera camper. I might have a buyer for the
tranny, already. 

Then it has a really nice working BN4 gas heater,
except I need to replace the glow plug. The gas heater
will be going on thesamba soon.

As soon as the motor, tranny, and gas heater is pulled
the rolling body is going up on thesamba.

Also this bus has the jalousie windows. It has
something I have not seen before, but it has the
screens, and it has storm windows for the winter. When
you pop out the screens it has framed windows that
take the place of the screens. So in the winter it
probably helps to keep some of the drafts from the
windows out. I am keeping these for my westy, for
sure. Has anyone seen these before?

Thanks,
Shawn R.
