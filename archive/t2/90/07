OK, the auto transmission bus is different than the stick in how it is
tuned and what connections need to be made.  that said, it sounds like
somehow the former owner got it working alright, and that the current
mechanic isn't quite sure how to do it, my 78 with auto tranny still has
the fuel Injection so this may not apply in all cases... the 009 or other
mechanical distributor does not work well with the auto tranny because
when you put it in gear it slows down the engine (This is normal and
designed in)but it causes a mechanical dizzy to drop down and loose
rpm.  it is a catch 22, each causes the other to slow even more. (does
that make sense)
 when he changed the engines did he use ALL of your old "stuff" from the
original engine??

  I would certainly begin a search for the fuel injection components for
that engine.

good luck, unfortunately because it is a non standard engine it could be
real difficult to find the culprit, (20 hours to find, 20 minutes to fix)
