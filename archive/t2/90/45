Subject: RE: [T2] synthetic vs. regular oil

I luv this thread, it's like arguing about religion.

1. Has anybody figured what it costs to use syn vs
dead-dino oil over the lifetime of an engine?
  Rough estimate in my bad math. based on the
following: 100,000 miles engine life. oil change every
3K. $1.50 quart for reg. oil vs. $4 for synth. 
Comes out to $396 for syn vs. $149 for reg. oil over
the life of the engine. (not counting adding oil
between changes). Am i missing anything?

2. Has anyone seen real evidence that engines last
longer with synth? Do they last twice as long?

It seems that it would be better to change your
regular oil every 1,500 miles. You'd still have $100
left over to buy beer! (Or to buy Marvel Mystery
Oil--but i don't want to even start THAT thread
again.)
