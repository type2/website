Subject: new carb

Those who read my previous thread should be familiar slightly with my problem. I talked to my mechanic and he assures me I need to replace the ford carb with a single weber progressive carb. I'm going to go ahead and do this because if he guarantees me this will work then it is on his shoulders if it doesn't. my only question is that, he is gonna charge $300 for the carb and kit, $100 for labor. the carb is a new weber progressive. does this sound right?
