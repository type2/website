Subject: 1981 Diesel Rabbit

hello all,

i realize that this is the bus list, but i figure
maybe someone on here will own one of these, and maybe
be willing/able to give me the rundown.

i am buying a 1981 Diesel Rabbit and i am wondering if
anyone has any info for me regarding any aspect of
this vehicle.

i am unfamiliar with the diesel, other than the fact
that "people say" they are supposed to be super
durable.

how does the diesel engine function, what makes it
"diesel" other than that it runs diesel feul.

also, my superviser at work told me (he used to own
one) that you have to plug them in during the winter
months, because the feul will freeze. something about
a glow plug??

any and all info will be greatly appreciated!!!

Matty
