I found this on the Mobil 1 site.

Myth: Mobil 1 will leak out of the seals of older cars. 


Reality: Mobil 1 is fully compatible with the elastomeric seals and gasket materials used in most modern engines. In engines that are in good condition, seal compatibility will not be a problem. Some older engines produced before the mid-1970s were manufactured with looser tolerances than today's engines. Low-viscosity grades of oil can leak from these engines. The solution is to use a higher-viscosity grade like Mobil 1 15W-50 to reduce this leakage.
