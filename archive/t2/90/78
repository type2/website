 I disagree on this thought process.

Paint oxidizes because the sun has dried it out, and all is left on the
surface is the dried out pigment.

That's why it's called oxidized paint.

I could possibly be wet sanded, and clear coated, but their are two
chances of getting an even color, over the whole bus with the old paint
-- (1) slim, (2) none.    

You cannot rub an old finish with compound and then clear over the
polished surface---the clear would be blowing off in sheets, without
giving the base paint any biter's---it must be abraded with a scuffing,
or sanding, therefore removing more of what you didn't have in the first
place--paint.

I do agree however that a good Carnuba wax is probably the best--however
read what's in all the waxes---"Petroleum Distillates", which in common
terms is mineral spirits---
It along with whatever wax is in the stuff, makes the paint look
slick---but as soon as the wax and solvent's dry up from the sun--your
back to square one--dried up, oxidized paint.

My suggestion---forget the whole process, and get down and dirty--paint
it.

Brandt - 
Here's my .02 : 
Paint never really dries completely. As the base lacquer (what was
originally used on buses) evaporates over time, oxidation takes place
with the remaining pigment, hence the oxidized film on old paint.
Whether it can be buffed out depends on how thick the remaining paint
is. It's often very easy to buff right thru to bare metal or primer at
the very least.Try it in a small spot first. 
However, if there is a sufficient thickness left, you can try one of the
following methods: 
1) Clean the bus THOROUGHLY, first with a good quality car wash soap and
water. Do this in the shade so you don't bake soap and old dirt into the
old paint. Make sure you get all the nooks and crannies. 2)Clean the
surface again, this time with a good quality dewaxer/degreaser and a
paper towel. Allow it to dry before proceeding. 
3) Remove the oxidation with HAND compound. Machine compound on a buffer
will take it down to metal.Red is for heavy oxidation, white for lesser
damage. 4)If, after all this work, the surface is smooth and even,
proceed to the next step. If not, or if the surface is too thin, you
will need to repaint - at least you've prepped it well :) 
5)Compounding alone will not stop oxidation; it only removes the already
oxidized paint. At this stage, put on a nice coat of hand glaze. This
seals the surface and evens out small pits. After this has dried to a
haze and been bufed with a terry towel, proceed to wax the finish. By
this time it should look pretty good. 6)Use a good quality carnauba wax.
That's all you need 
- no snake oil, miracle claim stuff please. Again, let it dry to a haze
and buff with a dry terry towel. This will stop oxidation for a while,
but like anything else, not permanently. Remember to wash the car often
(always with good quality soap) and wax it - but don't wax more than 4
times a year; the buildup is a b!(-at-)#% to get off. 
7) Finally, another option is to clearcoat the finish after step 4.
Urethane clear will work well over old, CLEAN lacquer; make sure this is
what you have to avoid compatibilty problems. 
It takes quite a bit to restore an old finish - I set aside a full
weekend for the above. It can be worth the effort and of course nice
original paint is a good thing. Cost? Maybe a hundred bucks for all the
necessary materials (don't cut corners here). Clearcoat? 60-100 bucks
for urethane; DON'T do it yourself if you don't have the suit and air
supply. A good shop will charge you $6-800 for the task, more if you
haven't done a decent prep job. 
Hope this helps!
