     The list is tired of hearing me gloat- I've got 233,000 mi on my 78
Westy, runs fine but does blow a qt of oil per fillup (no sign of
burning); oil pressure this summer depended on temp- at a high of 250
deg it will only do 22 psi at 3000 rpm, so I run it cooler (slower) than
I used to.  In winter It's hard to get it to 212 (ideal to get the water
out) and it's over 33 psi.   Oil changes are about every 3-5K and I'vre
used TUFOIL (ptfe/moly additive) since I got the bus with 60K on it. 
Before being fully warmed up (but long after oil pressure is up) it has
a new sound upon acceleration that's not quite a knock but depends on
rpms and is sort of a sound I've heard on bugs when the differential is
going (a shhhr-shhhr noise).  I CANNOT hear it when my head is in the
engine, only when I sit up front.  In the engine compartment I hear a
slight knocking on the left side- distr/cam? I had a rod bearing go on a
bug, and that was a decided knock on acceleration.  If it were a rod,
would this sound be diminished if the ignition to that cylinder were
removed temporarily as a test?
