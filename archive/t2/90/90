The table is basically just a piece of particle board with a groove 
routered around the edge for the plastic or rubber edging. The portion that 
attaches to the arm is sort of like a plate with a short piece of vertical 
pipe welded to it to slip in the hole at the end of the arm. The plate 
portion is just to get the table a bit higher and get the table top away 
from the arm a bit. You could do the same with an additional piece of wood. 
Very heavy and $$$ to ship.

Some the Westies had a table top that partially folded for storage. 
Basically the same top with an offset cut and equipped with hinges - much 
like a drop leaf table.

If you can get the dimensions you could make it as cheaply as buying it. I 
can send you dimensions of mine. Sorry no digital camera so no pics.

will hop in here with an address. Pleanty of material out there for you.
