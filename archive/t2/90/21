Subject: RE: Synthetic oil

Hi,

A few simple considerations about oil... The biggest argument against synthetic oil used to be that it did not transfer heat well, which was a 
property unavoidable at the time in order to get it to perform so well at high temperatures. I am not convinced "they" have done away with that 
problem. Our aircooled engines rely on heat transfer to cool them. Imagine all that heat in your heads not being transported out with oil flow. 
Sounds bad to me. 

A commonly discussed advantage of synthetic oil is that you do not have to perform oil changes as often because it does not break down and 
lose it's viscosity as quickly. This is I find irrelevant because I change my 20W-50 non-synth every 2000 miles, which is way before it breaks 
down, simply because I want really really really clean oil in there all the time. You are constantly wearing down your engine and contaminants in 
the oil speed up the process. Dirty oil wears your engine down faster. Why bother leaving dirty expensive (and possibly bad heat conducting) 
synth oil in there when you can put cheap oil in more often and keep it clean (which is the real objective). If you ever meet somebody with 
astronomical mileage on their engine, ask them how often they change the oil. I have and the answer is never "every 5000 miles, just like the 
manual says". 

If I become convinced that heat transfer is just as good in synthetic oils I will still want to change at 2000 miles while it is still looking clean. 
Sounds expensive. Maybe the added protection at high temperatures will be worth it though. I guess it's not that expensive.

Bob
