Jan & I left Cupertino (just south of San Francisco) on Thursday night at 5 
PM. We stopped in Bakersfield and then drove through to Lake Havasu, getting 
there as planned in the light at about 4 PM.
We camped next the New Mexico contingent and enjoyed their firepit as I 
thought it was brutally cold at times. The swap was great for us as I took 
along an engine stand that had been taking up space in my garage and it now 
has a good home in Kansas.
I discovered with Karl's help that the scissors hinges on my 70 westy were 
failing on both sides and that is the reason for the bungey cord holding down 
the top on the passengers side.
We drove to LA where we stayed on Sunday & Monday nights. Tuesday we left 
around 5pm and stopped again in Bakersfield on the way back.
Got back home at lunchtime on Wednesday having driven 1300 miles.
The bus cruised along at 3800-4000 rpm and the oil temp never went over 210.
We seemed to use less than a quart of oil.
But I have to fix the heater in the bus as it does not get on our feet and we 
drove along with coats, gloves and woolly hats!

All in All a great long weekend and we cannot wait for next year.
