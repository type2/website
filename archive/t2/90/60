I luv this thread, it's like arguing about
religion.

1. Comes out to $396 for syn vs. $149 for reg.
oil over the life of the engine. (not counting
adding oil between changes). Am i missing
anything?

You may be.  Ever seen an engine overheat
resulting in oil failure and a thrown rod?  (Must
admit that the most common VW engine failure,
dropped valves probably wouldn't be affected by
synthetic.)  NASA and lotsa engineers seem to
think that synthetic lasts much longer at
ultrahigh temps.  

>Has anyone seen real evidence that engines last
longer with synth? Do they last twice as long?

See above.  

>It seems that it would be better to change your
regular oil every 1,500 miles. 

Not a bad plan at all.  I never go more than 2k
on an aircooled engine.  Oil is too cheap. 
Engines too expensive.  

> You'd still have $100 left over to buy beer!
(Or to buy Marvel Mystery Oil--but i don't want
to even start THAT thread again.)

Just read on another board that some dude would
put MMO in his Explorer SUV and expected to get
2-3 mpg increase?  When I said "huh? how does
solvent do that?" he responded "that's the
Mystery part."  

Maybe I should be selling MMO door to door.
