Subject: Re: [T2] MegaSquirt on the type4

Please keep this info alive on the list (publically). I took a good look 
and plan to start educating myself on this topic and working towards this 
system on my Type IV Beetle and eventually my Corvair powered Westy.

I want to learn all that I can before I jump in.

Hoping to also update the ignition to at least Vanagon standards. The 
Corvair guys have worked out some of the details on adding knock detection 
to the ignition system too to retard the ignition using off the shelf 
parts. I'm seeking details so that I/we might apply it to the VW.
