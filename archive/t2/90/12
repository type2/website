Rear doors and/or opening rear windows will draw exhaust into a moving
vehicle. There is  truth to the statement that the doors add to the
structural strength of the body just as the glass in the windows do.

Not sure about illegal, but I was always told not to drive with the sliding
door open because it puts stress on the wrong areas of the bus and can
damage the body structure.

True or not?

I'm not sure, but the guy who told me usually knows his stuff, so I always
close it now just in case.
