Obviously, don't try this in a bus.  Filter
system is no where near good enough-- especially
you upright folks with nothing but screens!

>Now to bring dino juice back into the picture.  
Consumer Reports did a great article a while back
on NYC cabs and the oil they 
use.  They took new
engines and put different oil in the engines for 
100,000 miles and tore them
down to compare with each other.  Basically any 
oil with an API starburst
symbol is good enough to show minimal wear of 
engine components just as well
as synthetic or each other.  Basically a normally

aspirated car is fine for
dino juice in my opinion based off of studies.

Not what they said.  They tested for 60,000 and
said they had insufficient data to determine any
"trends".  It should be noted that these NYC cabs
run 24 hours a day-- not start up wear which is
most of the wear on an engine.  Then CU comments
that there were no definite "trends" in wear and
"no demonstratable advantage" to synthetic.  
That is something very different than saying dino
is just as good as synthetic.  I read it several
times and wondered why they worded it they way
they did, then came to the result they did off
that assertion.  

It would have been nice to have seen raw data
such as which engines showed what kind of wear on
what oil.  Bottom line:  if you intend to never
shut your engine off and only care that it
reaches 60,000 miles, use any old oil and change
it at 6,000 miles or more.  I don't believe CR's
assertions otherwise have any useful application.
 

I agree with you though--modern dino is plenty
good enough to reach normal engine life. 

Also, if you want a "blend" then brew it
yourself.  The blends on the shelf are only about
10% synthetic and 90% dino.  It would be cheaper
to buy two quarts of syn and two quarts of dino
and get a 50% blend.  

Happy Bussin'
