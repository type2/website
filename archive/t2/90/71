Subject: Re: [T2] Movie Double Cab "Abusers"

Sorry, Scott but I'm with Bob.
I'm not sure if you're aware, but Dual Cabs are second
in popularity only to Sambas, even Baywindow DCs, &
the fact that they're a tradesman's vehicle means
they're getting even rarer, even the Bays.
O.k., so let's be realistic, we're all aware that we
can't save every bus out there, but the chances are
that if these guys are going to "abuse" a DC it won't
even be good for parts at the end.
It'd be strange for a mailing list whose sworn duty is
to preserve as many Type 2's as possible to arrange
for some Hollywood Philistines to destroy yet another
bus.
It's bad enough watching 70's & 80's war movies and
seeing them destroy Kubels on a wholesale basis.
Call these guys back & tell them to use a Chevy :-)
Cheers
