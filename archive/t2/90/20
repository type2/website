Does anyone know where I can get a bike rack for my 1978 VW

Yes, I have hatch mounted bike racks that attach to the hatch and do not 
require any drilling.  The rack will hold 2 bikes and it allows access to 
your engine compartment.

The website price is $250, but I will be dropping the price to $195.00.  I 
made a special purchase of these and they are arriving next week.  I have 3 
in stock and will honor the lower price if you call in your order.  The web 
price will change in a few days.
