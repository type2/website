I'd like to attempt to pre-empt any threads on how environmentally
friendly diesel/bio-fuels are versus electrical vehicles, etc., by
saying that anyone interested in debating that topic should
contact me directly as opposed to clogging up the type2 list.  This
topic is already on the fringes of bus content and there's no need
for a debate on what's enviro-friendly and what's not -- at least not
here. 

cheers,
