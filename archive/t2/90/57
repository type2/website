    My 15 y/o son and I just got back from getting our new to us 1971 =
Westphalia and we are going to begin the process of getting to know it =
and restore it.  Just a couple questions that we are wondering about.
    First, the engine number is not under the generator stand but rather =
to the left of it and on top of the engine.  The number is U5036389.  I =
assume this is a type three rebuild.  Do I need to approach it =
differently for service etc.
    Second, the generator light came on during the trip.  At first we =
could tap on the brush on the left side of the generator to make it go =
out but for the last 400+ miles that did not work.  Any ideas on whether =
we should just replace it or what.
    And finally, it has Bn4 gas heater and though I've read all the =
articles in the library and archives I still don't know if I can remove =
it to rebuild without taking out the engine.
    Sorry for being such a novice but appreciate any advice.
Thanks in advance
Steve and Kyle
