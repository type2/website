Mike and list,

Yes.

I plan on removing the AFM and entire air filter assembly since the air
filter assembly will not mate directly to the S-tube. I plan on choosing a
tall/round filter with a smallish diamter and fabricating a holder of
sorts - probably using plastic plumbing stuff - haven't working this out
yet. I don't forsee any problems regarding the extra air flow - perhaps some
benefit.

I've decided not to cobble on a TPS. Initially I'll get it running without
any acceleration enrichment. Then I'll probably modify the code to increases
in manifold pressure to trigger acceleration enrichment - the code right now
uses increases in throttle position. I've looked at the code modifications
needed for this and it's quite trivial.
