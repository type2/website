Subject: Re: [T2] bike racks

I picked up a Hollywood rack that holds two bikes from the local bike
shop.  There are 4 nylon straps that hold it in place against the rear
window and the bottom of the rear hatch and folds up to put away.  I
think it cost around $50 US.  

If the shop can't find the rack SPECIFICALLY for your vehicle, the minivan/Vanagon
models fit.
