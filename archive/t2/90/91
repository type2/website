The diesel fuel is more of a lubricant instead of a solvent like gasoline. 
Keeps the cylinders and such happier longer.

If there was any water in the fuel it could freeze. For some reason diesels 
have more problems with water in their fuel. Most have water filters in 
their fuel system.

Also diesels need a bit of heat in the cylinder to aid that first morning 
start on a cold day. The colder the weather, the more dependant they are on 
this. It comes in the form of glow plugs. You turn the key to on, a light 
on the dash and a relay under dash energize and the glow plugs get warmed 
up (electrically) for a few seconds depending on the temp that morning. 
5-10 seconds. Once the glowplug light goes off you can start the engine. I 
was always told that if you start it when the light is on you could damage 
the glow plugs. That is hearsay so check it out.

I've driven Fiat, Renault, Peugeot, VW, Mercedes, Chevrolet, Dodge, Ford, 
and Citroen (I think) diesels and as long as there is a turbo in there or 
if it is of sificiant displacement. I prefer the European Diesels in a car. 
Very good little engines.

Save your money up for a turbo and intercooler. Makes a nice engine. I 
don't think VW ever offered these engines with them in our market.

Buy yourself a block heater. Any brand will work, will help keep the oil 
and block a bit warmed and easier to start if the weather is really cold.

Tatra has made hundreds of different wonderful air cooled diesel engine 
designs. They raced several big trucks in the Paris to Dakar Rally this 
year (as they usually do). Apparently very good engines and very good power.

Bet that would be hard to find in the U.S. I'd love to have one for my bus!

Just so you know - air cooled engines are inherently noiser due to lack of 
waterjackets (and other reasons) and diesel engines are inherently noisy 
obviously. Put the two together and it would be quite noisy. You'd have to 
get creative in the noise reduction areas. Maybe not a big deal in a big 
truck but probably hard in a passenger vehicle due to space and weight 
restrictions.
