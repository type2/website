In traveling about in our '82 Westy I have never been pulled over, even
during the 100 miles that it was trailing smoke like a WWII fighter on its
way down (lunched on the #3 piston).

As to the driving while impaired, many years ago Car and Driver did a couple
of tests with several drivers going through several driving tests.  One was
using measured amounts of alcohol and the other was using marijuana.  I'll
try and track them down over the next couple of days if any one is
interested.
