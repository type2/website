well some years ago I tried (key word tried) to electrify a 71 I owned
when it threw a rod.......needless to say the complexity of it is a lot
more than meets the eye.   I was ending up pileing the entire area between
the axles with batteries and the engine with a 12hp fork lift
motor...never did get it to run worth (-at-)#&$*.   of course that was before
the reasonable avaliablity of solid state controls so now it would be
muchh easier and cheaper, but rebuilding a two liter is still cheaper by
comparison.
