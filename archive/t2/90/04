Gosh...does this sound like a case of "I have a weber progressive and a
009..." to anyone else? :)

The problem here is that (I'm grasping at a few straws with this) the
mechanical advance distributor that is generally used along with the Weber
carb is completely wrong for the type4 engine.  It just doesnt advance far
enough.  This causes a: a high idle, but lots of power. (the advance at
idle is to high, but its just right at speed.) or b: a decent, normal
idle, but the engine bogs out when you press the gas, and generally has no
power. (correctish advance at idle, but it doesnt advance soon enough to
keep up with the engine trying to accelerate. then, it just never advances
far enough, robbing the engine of its full topend power)

I'd say that your mechanic probably timed the engine at idle or staticly,
causing problem b: above.  Of course, he could have adjusted the carb to
try to work this out, as well, causing even more problems.

I'm not at my best today, so i'll let someone else explain what I've said
in english. :-)
