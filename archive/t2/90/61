Hi Folks,
The pin that attaches the L shaped arm to the accelerator pedal in my 
baywindow went kaput. I got a replacement but can't figure out how the arm 
is supposed to be. Looking for your infinite wisdom.  I'm going nuts trying 
to figure this out.  I'm probably being a bonehead! Thanks



Joy thru Air,
