Subject: 1977 westy info and parts needed

Hi, I recently aquired a very nice 1977 westy. I need the rear table. I have
the arm but no table.
I would also like to find a owners manual and a campmobile manual. Is there
info on the dual batteries
in either manua? What about the fridge and batt. charger?
Any help would be great.
THanks,
Dave Parsons
