well, yes and no... 'modern' car? yup. old vw? nope.
the case of a vw is readily eaten by water; one of the main reasons vw
specified its shorter oil change interval was to remove the water puddling
in the case from stop-and-go driving. if you are not doing a lot of
highway driving, or you see 'mayonnaise' in your oil cap, you need to stick
w/ the program.

not to mention the fact that nearly every vw i see on the streets
(including mine :P) runs overrich, thus diluting the oil quicker.

one day i'll get me one O them european aluminum t1 cases, and GET that 10k
oil life :)
