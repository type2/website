Rev it to 3K rpm and hold it for a few seconds and let it fall to idle.

I usually hear rods rattle as the rpms fall.

Could also be a wrist pin bushing.

I my experience it is hard to hear bottom end problems right next to the 
motor so in the van might make it easier to hear. Low frequency noises I 
guess.
