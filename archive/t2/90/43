Hi Lloyd
If it's a '75 it's probably a 2.0l or maybe an 1800.
As far as FI or carbs go, I live in Australia, and
unless the parts distribution in NZ is better than
here, you probably can't get new parts for the FI so
even if it had FI to begin with, the chances are that
someone got fed up with trying to fix it and put carbs
on it.
It's certainly not a 1600 as the only T2 model in '75
to pack a 1600 was a pickup.
Good luck and I hope it's in good nick.
For AUD$2100 you'd get a bus that's fair to
middling....in NZ I'd imagine things aren't that
different.
Cheers
Andrew Wood
