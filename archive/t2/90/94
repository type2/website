Subject: Re: [T2] Cops& Bus's (Fri Topic)

OK Volks, It's friday so I'll share a few of my Cops& Bus's tales.

While driving down a fair sized hill and seeing that I'll be having to go up 
another I'm gathering momentum, an old station wagon pulls out of a trailer 
park, even though there are double yellow lines I pass 'em! Unbeknowst to me 
there is a SC Hwy patrol behind me!  Yeah he's got ta pull me over...being 
raised in the south I say my "yes sirs" and "no sirs" and proceed to explain 
it's the nature of the beast.  He accepts gives a warning ticket.

Got the ole weaving pull over, I shows him the 180* play in the steering 
box, he laughs, no ticket!

Been pulled over and frisked cause I stopped at a closed gas station to get 
a soda from a vending machine, peered into the window to look at a picture 
of a huge tow truck. 1/4 mile from home two or three pull me over, one 
officer sees the machete in the back and says "This is a concealed weapon" I 
says "This is a Camper, I do camp often" OK the sarcasm creped into my voice 
a little, but the other officers let me go. Apparently the station had been 
robed.

Did get pulled over because of a bad tail light, me and my buddy ditch the 
roach, but we're questioned about the used syringe...needle broken off (been 
a diabetic since 13) Thumped the rear quarter panel the light comes back on 
and he let us go.

In 18yrs owning this bus I had never gotten a ticket other than warnings.

Until.....
One more,  On the way home from "Hippie days" last year, No tags,no 
Insurance, No Reg.. Yeah I was pushing it and did get $150 worth of tickets. 
Passing through Pisgah NF, park ranger pulled me because the "Vintage" 
dealer tag was only hanging on by one bolt, "Janis Joplin" is on the tape 
playing "Lord it Just can't be".  Now the cool part.  The Ranger explains 
that he should have the vehicle impounded untill I can gather the needed 
paper work...(here I am dressed like a hippie)... or (here he begins to 
raise and lower his eye brows) I can figure a way to get it home... Trying 
to not be too grateful I calmly tell him I'll try and figure a way to figure 
a way to get it home.

There are probably more but over all, I'll attribute my good fortune to good 
maners and "Busma".
