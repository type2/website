What is that mayonnaise? I never saw that in my 75 (1800) but the 76 I have
now with the
2 ltr always has that gunk on the inside of my oil cap?

PS - I found a "REALLY" cheap place to get VW bus parts :
www.bimmerparts.com
You can one of those glovebox locks for about 12 bucks! Beats the 50 or so I
have seen them
going for. I found they averaged about 3 - 10 bucks less per part from even
some of the mainly bus part guys.

I should add I have zero experience with them, so who knows, maybe slow
shipping or bad customer service. I am putting in a order for all my brake
needs and will see.....
