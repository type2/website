Subject: m9 to m8 exhaust studs.

VW has obsoleted the m9 to m8 exhaust studs for bus heads. Does anyone
have three squirreled away with which he or she might be willing to
part? The best I've been able to find locally are hardened m9 studs, but
they are not a stock item and I will have to buy the minimum -- either
100 or 500.
