It will mix with the oil which is why you apply only as much as you require
to seal the case. AFAIK it's ok that this happens partly because you dump
the oil quickly after you break in the motor.

I've always had helpful replies from Loctite's tech support line. Give them
a call, tell them you are using 574 to seal an automotive crankcase and they
can advise you from their database.
