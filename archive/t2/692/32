I just installed an AVP engine from Bus Depot into a 72 bus. No leaks and
the engine is super smooth: it idles smoothly, revs smooth, accelerates
smoothly. I rebuilt the stock PDSIT carbs and they turned out to be
excellent. It's too bad these buses are too often converted from stock.

It's on the exhaust pipe, driver's side, near the bumper. It will probably
be hard to remove and you may strip the flats if you use a crescent wrench.
