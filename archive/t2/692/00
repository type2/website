Subject: Re: [T2] Case sealing methods

Okay, I ordered this Loktite stuff from Pelikan (sorry, Scott). It 
should be here on Thursday. I ordered it because you were the most 
adamant and persistent list member. Also because if I didn't and my 
case were to happen to leak, you would have perfect "I told you so" 
rights. Well, you and Scott Lyons.

So this whole rebuild is now riding on your shoulders. If this engine 
leaks, for any reason, you better load that big-*ss tool case in your 
bus and come out here and make it right.
