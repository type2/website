Subject: any idea where I can get a thermostat union nut?

Hello all - 
 
Just been informed by the Bus Depot that the thermostat union nuts are no longer available.  Of course this was after I gave them 80 bucks for the other parts I need to install a working thermostat.  Any ideas where I can find one?  Is it possible to fabricate one?  My vehicle is an 81 Vanagon.  
 
Thanks 
 
Marc
