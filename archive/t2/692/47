Hi,
I don't know enough about this to know if it needs to be posted on the 
vanagon list instead, so please excuse me if I got that wrong.
I see a lot of ads for an I4 conversion kits for diesel vanagons.  Is this 
kit used to put a jetta engine in a vanagon?  Would it matter what year?  
Could it be modified for a bay?
Thanks a lot,
Kyle
