I don't think Dave was suggesting the studs would be found at Ace.

From my own experience I find they have a poor selection of metric and the prices are unreasonably high compared to other hardware chains, like OSH.

I have to rely on www.olander.com (local company) for metric and even they can't carry it all (sometimes they will special order items). www.mrmetric.com is another local vendor but they haven't been as useful and Olander.

Has the Porshe dealer run out of N-014-684-1?
