Don't forget cooling... 

Yes you can get an adapter to mount just about any engine to any transmission but the complicated part is all th collateral stuff: electrics, ehaust, mounts, clutch, cooling, heat for the interior. 

I know with conversion the actual bolting of the engine into the bus was easy. The hard part was designing to mounts, cooling, and exhaust.
