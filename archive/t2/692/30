I started getting the engine ready for dropping last Sunday, it's
leaking oil all over the place, the oil drain bolt was cranked so
tightly that it bent the metal on my (admittedly cheap) socket
adapter. Compression test results show only 60psi on the #2 cylinder,
hinting at additional problems... further reading uncovers endless
stories of GEX woe.

All to say, that I have taken your advice (and my wife's bonus!), and
ordered a rebuilt engine from busdepot.com. I hope it turns out a
little better than the GEX, but from what y'all have said about
busdepot, I'm sure that it will.

I did come up against one difficulty while stripping connections from
the engine - I couldn't find the O2 sensor. I don't really know what
I'm looking for... would somebody mind pointing me in the right
direction? This is an '83 aircooled. Pics of the engine are linked
below, along with my notes-to-self for putting it all back together
again :) I'll add more detail when I have the manual in front of me
for reference again.

Thanks again,
