We carry some of Schofield's metal here in the U.S., including the front
floor sections that you need.  See
<http://busdepot.com/busdepot/details/busmetal.jsp> . Most of our sheet
metal is either genuine Volkswagen (the best, when we can get it),
Schofield, or Klokkerholm/Denmark. We pick and choose the best product from
each manufacturer, and also try to go right to the source in order to keep
your costs down. (For example, some of Schofield's metal is actually just
rebranded Klokkerholm parts, so of course on those we go right to
Klokkerholm.)
