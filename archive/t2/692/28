Hi Chris,

I think I wrote you when you were struggling with this last time. The
breather with the canister on top is good for fuel injection, but with
your weber you should be able to use the older breather that has the
straight through sheet metal work. Also hope your weber is jetted
right so you don't burn your new engine.
