Hi Chris,

One cheat could be to unscrew the cannister from the top of the
breather box. Maybe RTV goop around your emissions hose to keep it in
until you can get the early style breather.

Points? How about condensor? Is your bus warmed up? Single weber can
be balky in cold weather. Is the carb clean and flowing fuel well?

Good luck,

John
