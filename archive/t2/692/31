I very strongly agree with Mr. Horrigan! A picture of the ABA clamps can
be seen at:

http://www.western-marine.com/page118.htm

The correct clamps are labeled "mini clamps" and are on the left (Dave, I
hope these are what you are referring to!). While the 13's will work, I
tend to use the 11's rather than the 13's as I find that the 13's close
all the way before getting snug.  The 11's are very snug to get over any
"swell"  in the pipe, however and have to be assembled carefully.  I would
love to try the 12's as I think they would be ideal but all my suppliers
carry the odd-number sizes only.

OOK!
