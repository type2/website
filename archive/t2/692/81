Subject: 76 fuel gauge 

my fuel gauge has been acting funny before i had the problems and tear downs of engines and such...
i thought it must be the wire conection on the fuel tank it's self...?
well when one of the times recently that the engine was pulled i checked it and rewired it...
the gauge stayed right for a minute on the dash and back to the same thing...
well finally got the engine in to tinker with that and started looking at fuel gauge...?
it wont work at all now...
sooooo i looked under behind where it is in the dash...
there is a wire connector(-)(connector) loose there i plugged it back into the fuel gauge a spark and now it dont work at all....?
i checked fuses buttttttt nothing...is blown..?
should i just need a new gauge or maybe could there be something up with the wireing..?
i dont know how it came loose but somehow it did...?
i am guessing it was hanging on for dear life is why at one time it would fall down and then when i would hit a bump it would go back up again... ....?
 
any one ever dealt with this or something similiar...?
peace and love
Chris
