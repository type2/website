Subject: A few things I'm working on

o Electrical connections: trying to route add-ons, and some of the 
original wiring in the engine compartment, through clean and efficient 
terminals. I'll probably check out Fry's over the next day or two for 
supplies. Multi-wire cabling from dash to engine compartment from West 
Marine, unless I can find it cheaper elsewhere.

o Vacuum lines and connections: molded hoses are mostly NLA. The whole 
thing's an unsightly mess. I'm looking into forming steel or aluminum 
tubes and tying them together to clean up the mess and to provide 
better vacuum.

o PCV valve: still working on a replaceable update/upgrade. I'll bet 
914 types are on top of this little problem.

o Cover for plenum, runners: I'm a mostly-stock guy and don't chrome 
stuff (or paint vacuum cans on distributors transparent blue). But the 
plenum is a real dog. I'm working on a cover that snaps onto the 
runners and says "Volkswagen 2.0 Liter". You know, for the shows.
