Subject: Sapphire II Radio with Playtape

About six years ago, I posted to the list that I have a Sapphire II
Radio with Playtape. I got it from a former listee, in a box of
discards when he moved. Jonathan Smith claimed it, but I never sent it
out.  :-(

His old e-mail address doesn't work. Jonathan, if you are still on the
list, get in touch and I will finally send this out.

But if Jonathon doesn't respond, this thing is still up for give-away.
Period accessory. For those who weren't born yet when our buses were
new, Playtape was a miniature version of 8-track. This thing probably
does not work, possibly can be fixed, only has AM radio. No tapes;
check that online. You may be able to get a tape of the Carpenters,
which was probably the most popular music for these things. If you've
never heard of the Carpenters, don't ask.

Free.
