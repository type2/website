thanks john this is pattly what i was talking about with cheating... someone sent me some instructions on it i got to re read them today.....
 
as far as the points.... reason i think its them is i took dizzy out yesterday just easier for me to get to that aways... and reset points adjusting them with my feeler gauge .016 .018 like it says in the bentley and put dizzy back in and she seemed to have more power on the hills and such so maybe i just still dont have them right>?
still a little off... i cant stond points.... gonna get away form them as soon as i hit the lottery and cant take care of some other things first....
 
the carb should be good ran great on my engine and has been rebuilt again since then in the process of everything being done to this new engine as well...
 
i am really looking forward to this driving thing people keep telling me about LOL....
i fel like  when i was a kid and raced go carts... we worked on them more than we raced them.. seems something always was falling apaprt on them... lol 
 
thansk again...
peace and love

Hi Chris,

One cheat could be to unscrew the cannister from the top of the
breather box. Maybe RTV goop around your emissions hose to keep it in
until you can get the early style breather.

Points? How about condensor? Is your bus warmed up? Single weber can
be balky in cold weather. Is the carb clean and flowing fuel well?

Good luck,

John
