Subject: cleaning out ERG or carb heat riser tubes

Re: cleaning out EGR or carb heat riser tubes 

I use a "Roota Rooter" to clean out these tubes.

Please be very careful when using this method. Please wear safety goggles.

I use steel wire rope of various lengths and diameters to clean out these
tubes. I have unclogged super hard coked up carb heat riser tubes. I use a
variable speed reversible direction drill. I chuck up a short piece of the
steel wire cable and I use it as a flexible drill bit to chew up the
blockage. The trick is to use a whole series of a little bit longer pieces
of the cable. You do not want the cable to stick out of the tube to be able
to form a loop and dangerously flop back out of the tube. You want most of
the cable inside the tube at all times. So you start with the shortest piece
and "drill" into the crud for about 1/2 inch. With a short piece you can
push hard enough to dig into the crude and the flexible cable does not flex
enough to flop out of the tube. Then you switch to a 1/2 inch longer piece
of cable and go again. Pretty soon you are pushing a long piece of cable
into the tube, but only working on chewing up 1/2 inch pieces of crude. You
cannot start with a long piece of cable because you cannot control it, it
will just flop around and rip you to shreds. Sometimes it works have the
cable turn slowly or to switch directions often. But you only advance 1/2
inch at a time. Sometimes it is convenient to mount the tube vertically in a
vise and pour in diesel fuel as a lubricant/flush. Eventually the tube is
super clean.
