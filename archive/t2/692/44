Subject: Re: [T2] Case sealing methods

I was just wondering. If the Loktite only cures anerobically, what happens to
the material that mushes out of the gap into the inside of the case? Seems
like it would be hard to get at with all the engine guts in the way. Does it
dissolve in oil or potentially slough off and plug vital oil passages,
especially the smaller ones leading to bearings and such? Would like to know
because if it works OK, I might like to give it a whirl on my upcoming engine
build.
