Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning out EGR tubes in plenum

I used bailing wire and twisted and turned it in there.  Then I used 
compressed air on the outlets inside the manifold to force the crud out 
the inlet.  Then more bailing wire, then more air and eventually shook 
everything out.  The bailing is thin enough that it will kinda go 
through all the crap and help pull it back out.  When I'd spray air in 
the inlet, I could then test to see which outlets were still clogged. 
I'd sometimes see pieces shoot back into the tubes so I'd put the air on 
the outlets and shoot it back.  In this case, compressed air is your 
friend ;)

enjoy,
MIke
