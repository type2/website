Subject: rebuild your EGR valve?

81 federal vanagon.

I have the EGR valve, it appears to be complete and not too hard to take
apart.

Can I just take it all apart, give it a good cleaning, and expect it to work
again.

The seal isnt in too bad of condition, maybe I can use some sort of
glue/sealer to get it to seat back in there properly?

I couldnt get it to move at all, at first, but now that spring is out and I
think I can put it all back together the way it came out, unless im missing
something here. (im guessing I am)

thanks!
