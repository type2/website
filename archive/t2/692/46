Mike asked:
 
 I did come up against one difficulty while stripping connections from
the engine - I couldn't find the O2 sensor. I don't really know what
I'm looking for... would somebody mind pointing me in the right
direction? This is an '83 aircooled. Pics of the engine are linked
below, along with my notes-to-self for putting it all back together
again :) I'll add more detail when I have the manual in front of me
for reference again.

I see from your pics that it is a Calif Vanagon, so yes you should have an O2 sensor.

Follow your EFI engine harness from the center over to the left. You should have a single
grey wire that goes to the #3 temp sensor. Then a small group that go up to black relay. 
Then a large group that goes to the double relay. Then a pair of 2 wires that goes to each 
injector. All these wires are white in the grey sheath. Now look for a green wire coming out 
of the grey sheath. It is the only non-white wire in the whole EFI harness. That one is the wire 
that goes to the O2 sensor.

Follow the green wire and it should connect to a terminal sticking thru the engine tin.
The other end of that terminal goes to the sensor. The sensor is screwed into the end of the 
catalytic converter that is parallel with the left exhaust manifold and left heater box.
