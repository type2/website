Subject: 914 oil temperature plates

Please explain Oil Temperature Plates.
Porsche used a cast cover for the sump plate with a sender mounted in it but
you can buy a standard VDO sender and drill a hole in a stock sump plate and
have exactly the same function.
If you need a sump plate I can scrape up one and I've probably got one of
the senders too.
It's just a matter of initiating a search.
P mail me if you need these parts.
