"A confusing issue in
my E-mail requests is why you can't run 2 or all 3 of
the energy sources?  Well the manufacturer cautions
you not to.  So don't plan on it.  I suspect it would
overheat with 2 or more sources running."

The reason is that with any one energy source the fridge is running flat 
out. Using several energy sources would be like converting a car to propane 
and then running it with both propane and petrol.

The manual for my 1976 Electrolux 3 way fridge states that 12v is only for 
keeping an already cold fridge cold while travelling. When camping, use gas 
or mains power.
