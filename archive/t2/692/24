Subject: Brake pedal goes to the floor, after pumping, brakes work....

When I go to brake in 74 Westy, the brake pedal goes to the floor like it
has no pressure.  After lifting my foot and pushing it back down, there is
plenty of pressure.

Is this indicative of the master cylinder leaking?

Any help would be appreciated.

Mark
