Subject: gear to cam bolt torque?

Does anyone know the recommended torque for the bolts that hold the gear
to the cam on an after-market cam? I purchased a stock grind hydraulic
cam from Fat Performance. I think they said 14 ft/lbs. but I cant
remember where I put the paper I wrote it on. Of course they are closed
for the holiday weekend and I'm trying to get my engine together this
weekend.

Thanks
Tom
