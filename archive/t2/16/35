Subject: 68-72 Front mat/it's here

    I now have the sample of the 68-72 Type 2 mat here at the store. I must
say VERY NICE, they even have the raised cup around the shifter and the
correct waffleing on the back. These are made out of pure rubber (no vinyl)
.  These are in a container on there way here and should arrive in the next
3 to 4 weeks.  These have not been avaiable for years.
