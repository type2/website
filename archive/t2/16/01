I just junked my '83 aircooled. Right before I did, I salvaged a few things 
and am looking to sell them. Here is what I have:
front grill w/ emblem
instrument cluster from front dash
vent grills off the back vents
the vent covers off the interior in cargo area
both side view mirrows
one front impact strip

I believe that is all I have. Email me if interested and we will talk price.
Thanks,
Jeremy
