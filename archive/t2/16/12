Sometimes this is normal.  The wheels are balanced radially and for wobble.  Most of the time you end up with weights on both the inside 
and outside of the rim, but not always the same weight.

If a tire requires a lot of weight to balance, I'll ask the tire man to turn it 180 degrees on the rim, which usually allows balancing with fewer 
weights.  A couple of times I've asked for a different tire when turning it didn't reduce the need for weights.  I like the tires to be reasonably 
balanced initially, as they wear more evenly and stay in balance longer.

Good tires used to have a spot on the sidewall on the heavy side of the tire, which you would match up with the light side of your rim (if 
you knew where it was).  Not seen too often these days.
