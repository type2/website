Roger,

Not normal, but certainly typical!  

It was possibly a less expensive "fix" to the original stock dual carbs that 
probably needed to be rebuilt and have the shafts rebushed.  

Here's the scenario: the Previous Owner got an $$ estimate on the 
rebuild/rebush work; he groaned a bit; then saw a wiz bang single carb "kit" 
that the person 
who-stands-to-make-money-selling-it-to-him-and-will-never-have-to-tune-or-serv

ice says "works great on a bus, better than stock" (probably also tried to 
sell him a chrome .009 centrifugal advance ONLY dist. to replace the stock 
combination vacuum/centrifugal advance dist.) 

Any way, it probably has no preheat for cool/cold weather starts and in high 
humidity may actually ice up.  They can be set up to work well and manifold 
pre-heat can be engineered in.  However, dual carbs will almost always 
deliver fuel more efficiently with better power than a single, center mounted 
carb.  They do, however, cost more and require more maintenance.

My personal feelings?  Convert it to either either stock L-jet or the later 
K-jet (CIS) fuel injection.  I had dual weber 40 IDF's and "upgraded" to 
K-jet.  I couldn't IMAGINE going back!  The webers are now on my ghia, but 
only until I take the time to convert it also to K-jet.
