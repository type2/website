Subject: Awning on a Westy?

Volks,
Just picked up a really solid 78 Westy for $450 in the hills of western =
Washington.  Anyway, beneath the passengers side of the pop top (when =
erected) there is a "C" shaped metal track mounted to the sheet metal =
which I assume is for an awning.  It appears aftermarket but I dont know.  =
There is no awning in the bus.  Just wondering what type of awning will =
fit in this track?  Any ideas?  Anyone else have this option?

Thanks
Chad
