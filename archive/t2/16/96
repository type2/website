Subject: Re: [T2] gear to cam bolt torque?

We torque the aftermarket cam gear bolts to 14 Lb/ft
We prefer to use loctite on them also, as if it begins to loosen, you WILL
have a bad day..

Be sure and check the oil pump to cambolt clearance as well, FAT uses the
same gears as web, and we sometimes have clearance issues with the oil
pump..If you do have some issues you can always spot face the cam gear so
the bolt will countersink into it...No more than .030 is safe..

I hope this helps, good luck with that hydro grind.....
