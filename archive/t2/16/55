Subject: $80.00 Windshield Installed

Hey Folks,
      Put my new windshield in tonight-no problem.  Nice to have a new,
unscratched, unfogged, although tinted-windshield. I wanted clear, but all
they had was tinted. So to recap, here is the story: Last weekend I cracked
the ( I believe) original windshield trying to reinstall it. I called around
to two Safelight auto glass locations and was quoted over $200.00 for the
glass. On the advice of a listee, I went to windshieldstogo.com and was
quoted $80.00! I called them, and was given the location of their warehouse
to pick up the glass,which turned out to be Safelite! See ya at the Bug Out!
