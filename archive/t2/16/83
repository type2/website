Good Doktor,

Your simplistic approach sounds real good on paper, but as you suggested
your only dealing with the evident outer damage.

The key to the elimination or retarding corrosion is staving it from
oxygen, and simply dealing with an outer panel isn't going to stop the
cancer's growth.

One must treat the inner surface of any given panel, to stop it from
rusting any further.

How exasperating a situation, to take the time to prepare and refinish a
rotted out panel, only to find a short time later, the rust has
reappeared just above or around that area.

The list member was inquiring on how to retard damaged panels from
rusting any farther until he could afford to do it properly, hence the
oiling of the panel.

Furthermore, another product has come to mind, which is a cosmoline /
wax based product by Evercoat, which if sprayed on any given interior
panel will stop any further corrosion, and is non-toxic item, unlike POR
products which have mass doses polyisosininates in them, which is a
known cancer causing agent.

If an exterior body panel is to be prepped properly, first it should be
sanded with no more than 80 grit DA paper, to avoid the deep gouges a
grinder would administer, and then the surrounding area's feathered with
no less than 180, and then a zinc rich self etching primer should be
applied, and then filler primed with a high fill primer, and then
feathered with no more than 320 paper, to guarantee adequate paint
adhesion.
A Scotch pad won't cut the mustard here.

Then totally skip the antiquated enamel's of yesteryear, and go with a
urethane based paint, for long lasting, durable,UV, and solvent
resistant result's.

PPG's refinishing systems are the finest in the automotive industry.

Let me reiterate, Josh was looking for a quick, stop gap measures, until
a later date, when funds were more available.
