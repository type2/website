You are aware that the gear ratios in the '73 tranny are different from 
those in the 5-rib 002, right?  The '73 is geared about 10% lower in gears 
1-3 and about 2% lower in 4th.

p.s. It's really a transaxle, not just a transmission.  :)  I call it a 
tranny so it will sound correct whether I'm talking about a transmission or 
a transaxle.
