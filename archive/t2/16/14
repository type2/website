Subject: starting problems, weak turnover

Hello list,

I have been working on my 74 bus with a 73 automatic
engine in it. This engine ran with the progressive
carburator on it but I recently replaced that with a
stock, 72, Solex carb settup. I also replaced the 009
distributor with the correct vacuum advance
distributor. I finially finished hooking it up today.
The points are set, but the timing is not. I put my
freshly charged Vortex battery in the bus and went to
crank it. The engine would turn over but not fast
enough to even get it to run. I had played with the
distributor, turning it and it did try to fire a few
times but, it seemed that the engine hardly had enough
strength to turn over. Whats going on here? 

I have tried this several times, each with a fresh
battery.(By the way, I cleaned and reattached the
battery cable clamps that went on the battery and
cleaned and gaped that spark plugs) Could this be a
sign of a fried starter? The battery is good. If this
is a sign of a dying starter, does anyone know where I
can get a new or rebuilt (not autoZone rebuilt) Bosh
starter for an AUTOMATIC 73 engine? Could this problem
be that the timing is that off? Thanks!
