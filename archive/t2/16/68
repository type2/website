Josh,

Cosmetic Rust?

What is cosmetic rust?

Is it holes?
Bubbles?
Or just paint popping?

What you could do to slow it down, and this is only if the panels aren't
bombed out, get yourself some gear oil, and spray it into the inner
panels---works good, stinks like crazy, (for about a week or so) but it
will stop the panels from rusting any farther, without making your bus
look like it belongs in the Ringling Bros. circus, due to big mismatched
touched up areas.

And if you do this process to the good un-cosmeticly rusted paels, it
will help them from rusting at all.
