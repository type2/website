George Lyle, as always, spoke true:  Try a different tire on that corner.  If 
your spare is questionable, swap the front left for one of the rears and see 
what you get.  That should give you a definitive answer on whether it's the 
wheel/tire or something else.  

I'd guess you've got a bad tire (defects from the manufacturer are not 
uncommon) or more likely a bent rim.  Most modern tire shops can check your rim 
for runout, but you can check it yourself for major problems just by spinning 
the tire and using a screwdriver braced on a brick to hold it steady.  

Jack up the bus and put a stand under it.  Spin the tire by hand and move the 
screwdriver and brick until it is just short of touching the outside edge of 
your rim.  It should stay the same distance both side-to-side, and up-and-down 
all the way around.  Do this on the inside and outside of the wheel.  You can 
also check for an out-of-round tire the same way by positioning the screwdriver 
along the tread.
