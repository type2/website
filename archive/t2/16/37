	I had a vibration in my Rabbit which peaked at 70 MPH and
was much less severe 5 mph above or below, nearly indetectable
at 10 mph above or below. I'd worn a rear tire down to the belt
and it was out of round. Melissa says she's got new shocks
and new tires, Ken suggests lug nuts, various comments about
balance of the tire are raised. 

	My $0.02 is that even if the tire is balanced, if its not
ROUND, because of a misadventure in manfacture or mounting,
it would give the symptom described. For example, if the wheel
were out of round. 

	WAY easy to check- jack up the front, spin the tire/wheel by hand, 
trail your finger tips along the tread as it spins, taking care not the 
break or pinch any fingers. Are the tires ROUND? (Probably worth 
checking all 4 although the feeling is coming from the driver's side front.)
