Hi Volks,
   I've been driving buses for over 20 years, and have been able to avoid 
the hot start problem for most of those years by servicing the starter once 
a year.  I've sent a description of what I do to any number of people on the 
list who wanted to know.  Well now I've found a web page that explains it 
all better than I can.  I'd suggest that you surf on over to  
http://www.hallvw.clara.co.uk/starter.htm  and look at the explanation.
   Whoever is in charge of the Type2 Library these days might want to get 
permission to either copy it into the library or at least link to it.
