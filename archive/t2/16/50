I looked at this bus again today,, and I found the original owners manual, and
Campmobile booklet, 

Inside the front cover of the owners manual, the Vw Honda Dealer, C-K Motors in
Brantford Ont Canada has written : model 231961 Camper Model year 1975, Colour
1976 Sage Green L-63-H serial# 2352134159
Licensed Aug. 13th 1976 
It has a 1976 CANADA Campmobile booklet that precisely describes and diagrams
this interior

Interesting?
