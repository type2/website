Subject: TRADE: brown vanagon front door panels for slider panel

Subject says it I'd like to trade a nice clean SET of brown vanagon front
door panels with dealer cut 4" speaker holes (and maybe the crappo
speakers) for a similar condition clean not ripped early Vanagon brown
sliding door panel.  These panels are off a '82, the slider panel needs
to fit the same.  Map pocket NOT included with the fronts.  These are
camper panels, no chrome strip, doesn't matter to me if the slider has
it or not.  I'm in Clarksburg WV but will drive to trade if within 2 hours or
so and will consider shipping if not doable.  Oh by brown I mean dark
brown not beige.

Thanks.
