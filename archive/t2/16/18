I have good luck sticking gauges in the glove box door. either you can cut
yours, or get one from a junk bus, and install it, then make the
cutouts.....this way your original is left  intact and the dash as well..

Subject: [T2] Oil Temp Gauge Mounting


I'm trying not to overheat another engine so I have bought a VDO Oil
Temperature Gauge for the 72 Weekender.

Up to this point I have been able to keep my dash original with no cuts, I
have a Sunpro tach in the clock position now.

Has any one else wanted to avoid cutting their dash and found the "perfect"
place to mount it without looking UGLY and having wires to exposed?

How about the mounting of the sending unit, it read to tap a hole in your
oil drain plate, any other suggestions? If I do end up taping the oil plate
any one have a suggestion for a block plate or something? I would hate to
break it off, the only concern is on campout where you might get into a rut
or something, haven't bottomed the engine out yet.

Thanks to all of you that can help and the best of bussin to the rest of us
:-)

This time next week I hope to be on my way to Picasso Moon, a Full Moon Bus
Club Camp Out! If you didn't make it last year I would suggest all the folks
close should come, it is an AWESOME camping spot!
