There are two ways (maybe more?) to balance a tire.  My wheel balancer has 
an option to either balance using only weights on the outside of the rim or 
use the outside and the inside.  The former is faster and the latter is 
more accurate although I haven't been able to detect the difference, when 
balanced to 0.0.  It could be that the latest balance was using the 
inside+outside method while the earlier balance was using outside-only.
