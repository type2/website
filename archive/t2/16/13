Subject: newbie question....

Hello all...

I had posted this message previously and many of you were very kind to
reply. However, my email program decided to inhale my saved emails sucking
them into the void on my computer.... thus, I lost all of your emails and
your replies...so I will try again sorry for the waste of bandwidth....

New owner of 1980 Westy looking for friendly mechanic to help inspect recent
purchase.

Basic details 1980 Vanagon. Leaks oil heavily. Some body damage, some rust,
4 different passenger tires installed, interior is ok with need for new
upholstery. Presently needing tabs and to pass emissions check in
Washington. Need help with that first.

Looking to find a mentor in Seattle area to help get vehicle on the road. I
have never owned a air cooled vehicle and have always taken my cars to the
shop to be worked on. So I am all thumbs when it comes to repairs. Willing
and eager to learn. Planning on using this Vanagon to learn on then purchase
a nicer one. Or if a restoration is possible willing to save this one. I
don't have a Bentley yet (it is in the mail should have it next week) I do
have the Chilton's, Haynes, and one other one.

Anyone willing and interested in helping out?

Thanks in advance....

Scott Cowan
