First rule of maintenance: STOP DETERIORATION

Start with a wire brush and knock off the scale. Pick off any loose paint
adjoining. Then grind off a bit more till you have a perimeter around the
rust of bright steel. Treat the area with Ospho, a rust conversion chemical
available at Ace Hardware or any such retailer. Brush off any dry powdery
residue that forms. Primer/sand/primer/sand till you have the quality of
finish desired. Seal it all with enamel. Buy quality materials and read and
follow the instructions.

Other hints. The abrasive surfaced sponges work very fast for feather
edging the existing paint. Primer will not seal, it breaths and will let
moisture through. It is just a base for the enamel that forms the seal. For
spot repairs to be followed up on later, you don't need the primer at all,
just nutralize the rust and seal with enamel.
