Subject: Schematics for TAI (transistor assisted ignition)??

Just crossposting to pertinent lists for any info on schematics for TAI
ignition systems. They are dead easy to build, as Tammer from the VintageVW
list sent me some basic parts needed. Has anyone built a system or know
where schematics for one are? There are also systems based on the Motorola
MC3334P chip as well. These systems can be built very cheaply to really
enhance the spark to plugs.
Thanks,
Courtney
