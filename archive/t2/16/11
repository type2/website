I am parting out a 78 bus. Has good doors, glass, engine. transmisson, heater 
boxes, clock, seats, rubber floor mats, lights, sunroof and many other parts. 
Parts are located in Rockford, IL. I will ship most parts. I also have many 
other parts from other year buses. E-mail with your needs. I need to clear as 
much stuff as possible within the next few weeks. Thanks

Dan
