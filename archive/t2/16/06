Subject: roof top, pop up tents

Frank in Ohio kindly sent me a picture of a nice Splittie
with one of the pop up tents that I sent out the link for a
bit ago... course at the moment I cant find it but.... the
picture is up on my site... very cool I will stick the pic
on it's own page with a link to the manufacturer's site as
soon as I find it again.
