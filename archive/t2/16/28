Subject: Two Arm Puller for Drag Link

Hey everyone...thanks for all the super advice on installing my new front
axle beam...you've helped so much.  I narrowed down what tools I need to buy
from all of your info....turns out I don't need to buy that much.  I
probably will invest in the two arm puller.  My friend at NAPA tells me that
there are different sizes of two arm pullers and that I need to take a look
and see what size I think might fit best.  Unfortunately, I am not near my
bus today and I was hoping to pick up those tools today....anyone know what
size "two arm puller" I should go for to remove my drag link?  Doktor
Tim?...(by the way, thanks so much for breaking down my email like you
did....you gave me so many answers.)

Thanks
Dustin
