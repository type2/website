now it is somewhat different with the Auto tranny,  there is the regular
end seal on the engine and there is a presure seal on the tranny (torque
convertor seal)  this seal I think should only be put on with ones
fingers.  it also has a peculiar quirk which is poorly documented.  it is
NOT pushed all the way in to the seat. rather it has to be flush with the
surface of the tranny otherwise it will not seal against the torque
converter (section 8.3 Bentley) and Heed Bentley they are VERY easy to
tear, I always buy two, I got a defective right out of the bag once.

and BTW does anyone know a source for the torque converter bushing, seals
are avaliable but I haven't been able to find bushings
