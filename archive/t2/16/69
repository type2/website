well I'm an engineer so I guess my welding and refinishing is no where
near your quality or speed but then I'm not doing it for someone else.

but I understand, I paid my way through college as a tour guide in DC,
needless to say whenever friends come to town the first thing out of their
mouths is "show me DC"  I generally give em the Grey Line schedule.

I go away I generally want to see a tourist like a hole in the head, went
to Nicaragua on my honeymoon.

don't got no Vanagon, in fact my 78 is my daily driver, only other vehicle
avaliable to me is my wife's Sant*rn and she usually needs it for work

I live in the big city and don't have any place to park more than one
I'm lucky in that I have a garage and a parking pad, but that's it. wife
usually has to park on the street (her's has lojack)
