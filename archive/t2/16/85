My offering was only to address temp fixes to stop advancement of rust to
be followed with a more proper procedure. It was designed to meet the
questioners desire for simplicity.

Either oil or wax will be a problem for future metal work/prep/paint. It
will wick into the seams and be impossible to remove so will foul any paint
in the vicinity. Then moisture will wick into the area between the
separated non-adhering edges under and adjacent the paint cracks and
promote new rusting of the seam. This will guarantee short term failure and
renewed advancement of coorosion in exactly the last place you want to see
it, the seams.  

Only after finsh paint has dryed several months would I use oil or wax, but
know that the interior of the panels rust only when water is getting in
there and can't get out. Fix the seals and unclog the drains and you have
then addressed the foundation of the problem, not just the results. 

Ospho for the interior panels would work wonderfully if you set up some air
flow through the panel to insure thorough drying. When the reaction to
Ospho is complete, there is no rust present. All has been converted to a
black hard sealed oxide. What Ospho will give you is an excellent base for
fillers/primers/paints, quite the opposite of oils/waxes. And Ospho is
thinner than water, so will wick into the seams to places an H2O molecule
can't even get to, and convert that rust as well. 

Do not use Ospho before final grinding. If you do you will find the
converted oxide to be harder than any abrasive. Even 40 grit open coat on
an industrial grinder will just glide over it and not bite.
