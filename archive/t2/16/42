Subject: Answers to front mat questions

1. They are only avaliable in BLACK

2. Molds were made off of OG NOS mats

3, No they are NOT shiney (dull black sheen)

4. Yes, the 68 and above DOES have waffling on the back and the raised
circle for the shifter

5. Yes the pre 68 does have the waffle, but no cut out for the high beam
switch on pre 66 models and the hole for the rubber e-brake boot, but I did
try a metal boot and it still works fine

6. NO, the VW part number has been removed.

7. Hope to price all styles under 100 dollars each

8. Yes I feel it is a very quality product

9. The container is on the water and should be here and through customs in
the next couple weeks.

10. There were 500 of each style made, so they should last at least 6 months
(supply)

11. The 59 and earlier will be ready soon

12. NO MIDDLE mats and/or Barndoor (but maybe soon if demand warrants)
