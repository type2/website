1976 VW Pop-up Camper 
2000cc Porcshe engine 
Standard Transaxle 
Runs, Driveable now 
Overall Good Condition 
Great Restoration Project 
$1000.00

Reality: 
There is some body cancer. 
The engine definitely needs rebuilding. 
It needs a new paint job. 
I have new pop top gaskets. 
It needs new window gaskets. 
The front windshield gasket was replaced about three years ago. 

Come over and take a look at it and make an offer if interested.
