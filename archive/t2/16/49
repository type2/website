Subject: Friday funny...

I've been saving this one all week!

Last Saturday I put some gas in a Bus and had one of those out-of-mind
experiences...unscrewed the gas cap, put it on the roof, put in the gas,
closed the gas door, paid the guy, drove off.

If you're thinking, "hey, he forgot something!" you are exactly right.

On Sunday night I went to the only open store in town to attempt to find
one...a Wal-Mart. They have a section they claim is auto stuff, right? Went
back there and strolled through every aisle; no gas caps. Maybe I missed
something; there's an associate, I'll ask him.

Asks the forgetful Bus pilot, "do you sell gas caps?"
Asks the Wal-Mart associate, "what's a gas cap?"
