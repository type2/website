Yeah - and you can read the damn diagram!  Not like the post 72 diagrams =
-
they're just plain cryptic for the average user.

I'll be getting into my 71 wiring soon. I found that i can actually figur=
e out
which wires hook to where inside the turn signal switch using the diagram=
=2E

With some studying and if the stock wires are still there, you should be =
able
to use the bentley diagram and hook things to the right places...pre72, t=
hat
is...

-C

The wiring behind the dash can be quite daunting if things are not hooked=
 up. =


The best thing to do is to pull the instrument cluster so you can see =

everything and start working through what is and isn't hooked up.  The wi=
ring

diagram in Bentley's is very usefull for this.

Good luck!
