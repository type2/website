Subject: how insulting

ahh friday. waiting in line for a ring up at the boneyards, feller in front
says "am i blocking you in...what are you driving", and i reply, pickup no
worries, you're ahead of me anyway. turns out he goofs around and gets back
to the lot after me. passing by the DC he says, "that's not a pickup, izit,
well ...MAYbe".  are them fighting words?   - steve
