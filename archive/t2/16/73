Hello Eddie,

I may be mistaken but if the date that is on the plate
behind the driver's seat says 2/74 that means it was
produced in 2/74 which makes your bus is a 75 year
model. I may be wrong but if you think of, say, a 2001
year model car, it first came out on the market in
2000. I could be mistaken, but that is what I thought.
Good luck with your Tranny! If I am mistaken, someone
please correct me. Thanks!
