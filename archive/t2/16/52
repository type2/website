Jamie,

My 1967 bus, produced in June of 1966, has many 1966 features[1], but a
1967 VIN.  VW did indeed produce bodies for Westfalia ahead of the
official release date, for conversion and simultaneous release with the
passenger models, but if my 1967 is any example, they coded the VIN to
match the expected release date.

At the same time, given the vast difference between the '75 and '76 westy
kits, that would tend to be authoritative.  If it weren't already 26 (or
7)  years old, it might make an interesting difference in whether or not
you needed emissions inspection.
