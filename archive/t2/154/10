Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch

That's always been my tailgating strategy no matter what 
vehicle I happen to be driving. That and a nice menacing 
glare into the rear view mirror. If they persist I give 
a little tap of the brakes to flash the brakelights. On 
my motorcycle, I have the light switch on the rear brake 
pedal adjusted so the light activates well before any 
braking occurs.
