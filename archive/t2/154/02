Subject: 15" Wheel info - more details

This info was posted recently on the Synchro group site. I have the article 
and details - including the part# for ordering 15" steel wheels from Tire 
Rack. Cost is about $40 a wheel.

I can e-mail anyone that wants it a virus free Word document that has 
pictures, and e-mail address of the author and all the information you need 
to pick up the phone and order the wheels you want.

These are the same wheels I was on the verge of buying myself, having 
finally convinced myself that they were the right wheels for my 
application. As usual I never have the money at the same time I have found 
a part I want, but at least we now know we can get what we want, when we 
want. Several of the VW aftermarket suppliers have nice wheels too but they 
are out of my budget range.

This works....

I wouldn't mind posting this info directly but the Type2 server won't 
accept images or attachments naturally.
