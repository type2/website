Philip,

The picture, heaters.jpg, shows a BN-4 and another heater.  This second
heater is one I have not seen before, but from its design, it could well
be a BA-2.  The "secret decoder ring" for Eberspacher heaters is, as I
understand it, as follows:

1st character B or D = benzin (gasoline) or diesel
2nd character N or A = New or Assist (In German, of course :-)
3rd character = heat output in thousands of Btu/hr

New vs. assist has to do with whether the heater sits in the  existing
heater pipe and adds its heat output to the existing heater system or
whether it sits outside the existing heater system.  Looking at that
second heater it looks as tho it is designed to sit inline with the main
heater tube that runs under your bus, so it would be an "A" and given the
small physical dimensions, 2K Btu looks right to me (the BA-6 is *much*
larger!)

The main limit on installation is whether all the control cables and
wiring are present.  If they are not, making them up can be trying.  With
the BN-4, be aware that you will need to cut the cover over the gas tank
and cut a hole in the body under the rear bench seat.  For occasional
extra heat, the BA-2 will probably be easier to install and will provide
plenty of heat.
