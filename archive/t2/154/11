I dont think  you could know if its the cooler itself or if the low oil
readings  lead you to just push the bus too hard.
You improved the oil cooling but the cylinder and head cooling that
depends on the air is stock. The head gauge doesnt seem to indicate
anything excessive but the burned rings sort of do.

I imagine the VW engineers with temp sensors all over the place, making
changes, redesigning and remeasuring to strike a balance.
