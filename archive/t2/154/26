Subject:  [T2] Electronic Ignition Alternatives Question

 
--chris,

I would think that a '79 bus system like mine would be easiest. You would need the control module, the '79 computer as the control module has a feed to it, the control module, the distributor or at least its guts and wiring, probably the double relay, which I believe is specific to the '79, and there is also a special coil. probably some other stuff as well.

Also the '79 sytem relocates the series resistors which I believe go to the injectors somewhere else in the system.

I will tell you that between the p.o. of my bus and me (10 years) there's never been a failure of the ignition system. Whereas my friends have cooked the pertronix system in weeks.

Better get yer wiring diagram out.

Karl?

Billy
