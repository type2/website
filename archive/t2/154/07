Would my head temp sensor give me an indication of this? It generally runs
rock steady at 350F, only pushing towards 400F under long upgrade & heavy
load scenarios.

I am inclined to lose the add on oil cooler. Although it has dramaticlly
reduced my oil temp, the survival rates of my engines seem to speak for
themselves.
