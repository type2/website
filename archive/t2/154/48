Subject: New shocks need for 74 westy, any suggestions

I need new front shocks and will probably replace
all four shocks next weekend.  Just wanted to
hear from folks regarding your experiences with
new shocks.  My options appear to be monroe gas
thingies for cheap like $10 each, gabriel gas for
a little more, and KYB's, either gas-adjust or
gr2, for about $30 each.  Any body tried one or
more of these?  

Also, without starting a thread, would the guy
who runs the Astro coilovers in the rear email me
offlist please.
