Subject: 68 to 71 brake light/turn signal info needed

Hi List,
    I need some info regarding the brake lights/turn signals.  Our bus is a
71 so that's what I'm concerned with but I believe 68 to 71 work the same in
these systems.  Here's what I need to know, when you have your foot on the
brake and either direction selected on the turn signal switch, what is
supposed to happen to the rear light on the side that the turn signal is
selected to?
1.  Does it stay on steady as a brake light?   or
2.  Does it flash on and completely off over and over, as a turn signal?
or
3.  Does it flash bright as a turn signal and then dim down to be a brake
light between flashes?    or
4.  does it do something else that my poor tired brain can't think of right
now?
    And as usual, thanks for the help.
