I just drive my speed. Its legal. If someone has a problem, its their
problem for the few seconds it takes for them to go by.
I drove the interstates ~1800 mi on the trip to EB at 55-60. I may have
passed 1 or 2 people, everyone else passed me. I dont care.
I drive I95 every day and Miami is as busy as most places.
I mostly stay on the left and like the tortoise I get there eventually.
Chant with me people...
I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED!
