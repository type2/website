Subject: southern Utah listees?

slightly off-topic.

next Friday (17th) i am heading to southern Utah with a friend of mine from
So Cal.  i will be in the area approx. one week and plan on visiting the
the following areas:
1) Zion
2) Bryce Canyon
3) Capitol Reef

unfortunately i will not be in my bus, but i was wondering if there were any
listees in this area?  might need a driveway to camp in or something.

any decent 'mom & pop' type campgrounds in the area with showers & possibly
a laundromat?

TIA,
