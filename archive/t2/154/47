I also have a '78 Deluxe and found a junked out '84 Vanagon a couple of
weeks ago at the local junk yard. While scavaging for stuff I noticed how
comfortable the seats were compared to my original bus seats(and they're in
excellent condition). Is it really as simple as it sounds to install them?
When I brought my bus home a month or so ago it took me about a week to get
my back in shape after a 2100 mile trip. My original seats have been redone
and look like new and I'm concerned about keeping it stock for looks or
replacing them for comfort?
