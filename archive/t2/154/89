Subject: Re: Freaky Electrical Problem on '68 Bus

Hi All,

Thanks for all the responses about my electrical problem. The problem is
fixed. In case someone else might have a simlar problem and can learn from
my aggravation here's what I found:
  After looking at the main 8 gauge wire running from the starter solenoid
to the front of the bus, I thought it looked like the connector at the
solenoid end had been tampered with at some point by the previous owner.
Though I couldn't recreate the electrical power loss anytime I would fiddle
with this connection I cut off the old connector and crimped on a new
terminal anyway. Before I bolted the connection back together I also noticed
that the bolt terminal on the solenoid itself was slightly loose. I don't
know if it spun loose as I was removing the terminal nut to fix the wire end
or if that was infact the source of the problem. So either way one of those
2 items was the source of my problem.

thanks again
