Subject: Look'n to buy a bus (Pre '73)


Still looking for my dream bus with a pop-top. Prefer
the pre-'73 era buses. Something totally restored,
that needs nothing. I don't have the patience or tools
needed to do any work myself. I just wanna put in the
key and goooooooo!

I live in the Los Angeles area.

Thanks,
Terry
