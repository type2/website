Works for me.  Puts a whole new spin on "recycling"...

And speaking of cables...  The current online catalog of Colemans Surplus [no connection to Coleman as in lanterns, etc.] has a bunch of brand new control cables of different types, in lengths up to 20', for ~$5.00 each.  Could be useful in engineering bus heater or manual choke retrofits, etc.

Go to:   www.colemans.com

Quite a few other items in their catalog that could be of use to an imaginative bus or camper jockey, including brand new 12V blower kits with all sorts of fittings, etc, for ~$10.00...
