You can get either momentary on switches or momentary off switches.  One
common way to add a brake light switch is to use the switch off of a
motorcycle rear brake.  It is pulled on by a spring that takes up any
further motion of the brake pedal.  Just secure the switch to something
and then attach the spring to the brake mechinism in such a way that
applying the brakes energizes the circuit.

You can also do interesting things with magnetic reed switches and relays.
You don't even need a mechanical connection with the brake lever, just a
switch near a magnet attached to the lever.

I still like the idea of putting the brake switch on the throttle.  This
would give more time before you hit the brakes for folks behind you to
prepare for your stop.  It's probably illegal, though!
