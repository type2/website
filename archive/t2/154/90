So, let me get this straight, no RTV?  ;-)

Thanks, I'll steer clear of the stuff.  Doktor Tim, 
thanks for the very specific points to look at.  I had 
planned on using Curil for sealing the case, but I'll 
look for the Porsche product.

As always, the list comes through.  I'll let everyone 
know how it goes.


Later,
