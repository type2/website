Subject: more AIRS stuff

forgot to mention this a few weeks ago. i made my first
A.I.R.S. rescue (sort of) on my way to EveryBus.

heading West on I-40 just past Chapel Hill, NC a guy drove
past me in a bug & waved. i was cruising at about 60 & he
was doing probably 70 or so. i waved back of course.

about 10-15 minutes later i see him on the side of the road & smoke
is coming out of the back of the bug. i pull up behind him & get out.
the decklid was open & about 5-6 feet away i
 could feel intense heat coming off the engine. the smoke appeared to be
from oil leaks.  a quick look under the vehicle indicated a severe leak
just in front (FIF) of the engine. ouch.

he wanted to try to drive but at my urging did not. he said he was going
to Greensboro anyway & i told him i would give him a lift.  turns out he
was some type of youth counselor & had to be in G'boro for some type of
activity with that. apparently he hadn't been on the road long, so he called
his dad who agreed to come check out the car the next day.

he offered me gas money but of course i refused.  i did tell him the only
 thing i required was for him to join the A.I.R.S. list, though.

sorry to ramble, but for once i wasn't the one who was being rescued!!!
(you might recall my previous adventures with diesel fuel & lost keys.)

keep on truckin',
