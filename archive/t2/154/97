Wiper juice is supposed to squirt onto the windscreen,
not down your leg.

I patched my washer system a few times, and finally fixed
it once and for all with new hoses throughout and a new
switch.  That was about five(?) years ago.  At that time, the
only store selling NOS '73 wiper switches was Wolfsburg West
in Anaheim, CA.

To replace the hoses to the squirters (without removing the
squirters from the steel body) park the wipers up halfway.
Jiggle the handle.  ;-)
This will allow access to the squirter fittings from inside
the vehicle.  Otherwise, the wiper linkage is in the way
when the wipers are parked at the bottom of the windscreen.

Don't use soft rubber tubing as a replacement. HARD rubber
tubing with the correct ID is the OEM way to go.  Vacuum
line did not work as a replacement in my experience, too
large of an ID.
