Confession !
I have a design for this, and it works !!
It is funnier than .............. you name it !

I remember this big land pig RV with the bow headed blue haired co-pilot 
using binoculars to read Casper's bumper stickers.
I couldn't believe it.
Mary Beth and I were just howling in laughter, and then........

A few squirts, and they backed off to where the binocs were not powerful 
enough to soak up Casper's political rear end.
