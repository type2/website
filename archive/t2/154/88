Ted,

But how does it run?????

Vacuum weirdness may be from the engle 110.....high overlap cam?

Timing light weirdness from cross wire induction pickup?
(wires running side by side for long runs).

Points or electronic??  Points bounce??  Bad points?
Bad spring on points....

Vacuum advance bad?  Just for grins put a vacuum pump on the cannister and 
pull a few pounds...then see where your points "snap" as you slowly rotate 
the engine toward 28 degrees.  Leave the vacuum pump on for a little 
while and see if it bleeds down.  

Visually inspect...make sure small 
braided wire inside dist is there and tied down good on both ends..

Cheers ,dave
