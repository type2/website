Subject: Email virus: Helvetica

Hey guys,

I've received at least three copies of what appears to be an email virus
from list members. The email usually has a subject like 'helvetica' but
sometimes changes. It contains an .html file and a .exe. I've seen both
setup.exe and mstheme.exe. The .html file talks about candle sales.

Please, please, please, if you use MS Outlook of any form, keep your anti-
virus definitions updated. There was a day on the internet when the 'Good
Times Virus' was a joke - a virus that could be spread by email. Microsoft,
in their wonderful brilliance, made it a reality.

My personal advice: quit using Outlook. Try Pegasus instead. It's free. It
works great. It doesn't spread viruses (unless you get an email virus and
run it yourself).

Personally, I use a web-based email system (kinda like hotmail and yahoo
mail, but on my own server). It's fairly impervious to email viruses -
especially if I use Opera to browse the site.

-Eric
