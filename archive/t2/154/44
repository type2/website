Subject: Stanford Hall VW Show UK - Pictures

I took a load of pictures at Stanford Hall this year and have posted a
couple of pages with the better ones on.

Visit: http://www.pagenumberone.co.uk/veedubs/index.htm

to have a look. Warning: lots of pictures so slow downloads expected.

One of the pictures shows a couple of heaters (BA2 & 6). Question: what
would I need to add to the BA2 to make it work and will it heat my bus ?
I'm not looking at sub-zero camping here just keeping warm in the evening.
Just ideas at the moment but the trader seems pretty genuine and helpful so
I may go this route.

Thanks

Phil
