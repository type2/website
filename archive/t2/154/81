Boges for 70 through 79 T-II's are $50 each front or rear plus shipping. If 
someone else wants to take orders and place one order with me for 10 sets, 
I would ship them all to the hero, and give them a 15% discount for their 
trouble. Personal checks will take 2 weeks to clear before shipping. Money 
order or cashier's check will ship immediately. If you want some, say so 
and give me your zip. I will ship either UPS or USPS, your choice. I'll 
gestimate the shipping and get back to you with the bottom line on a pair 
or set of 4. If you are in WA state, add 7.7% sales tax.

I would expect they are available elsewhere here and abouts. My supplier 
has warehouses in a dozen  western states but sells only to independent 
repair shops at wholesale. It just means they are available to jobbers 
anywhere if they want to carry them.

The sad news about T-II's and shocks is too many original Boge's in good 
order have been replaced by wizbang generic stuff designed to be cheap, 
except for the extra expense of big advertising costs necessary to develop 
sales. Think about how may Boge ad's you've seen lately. They put all the 
value in the product so it sells itself without a flashy campaign. Let's 
see, the original Boges on my 72 are now 30 years old, 180k, and function 
nominal. Superior goods.
