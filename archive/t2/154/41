Contact your local steel supplier.  Yellow Pages "Steel Distributors". 
Call 'em up and tell 'em you need x feet of (insert size here) 
Stressproof® round bar.

Here's how I made the Datsun swaybars...  I was fortunate enough to have 
a 1" thick steel plate bending table, but all you really need is a flat 
spot (garage floor) and something to protect the concrete from the 
torch's heat.

Bend a pattern out of welding rod.

Heat the bar "cherry red" and bend to your pattern. Let cool. (Do not 
quench!!! Quenching will make the bend brittle.)  Repeat for next bend. 
As they say, "Lather, rinse, repeat."

The hardest part is keeping everything square and flat...  It'll take a 
few adjustments, but it's really not hard. Try to avoid unbending. The 
severely weakens the bar. What you might use as a 'full scale' pattern 
is a piece of rebar. It will get you familiar with bending steel. And 
it's cheap.

Moog (or NAPA) will have bushings and brackets to attach it to the 
frame. Links you can find on American (or German) iron in the boneyard.

It's a project, but not an expensive one.

Fred Puhn's book is an excellent starting point.  If you're going to 
design your own, I might also recommend:

Steve Smith's Advanced Race Car Suspension Development
Carroll Smith's Tune to Win, Engineer to Win
Colin Campbell's The Sports Car, Its Design and Performance

Read as much as you can then start designing and fabricating!
