Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch


Several lifetimes ago, when I was driving trucks for Ma Bell, I found a simple solution for dealing with tailgating drivers [especially on the freeway].  Works just fine with your VW bus, too, and no modifications to the vehicle are needed.

Pull out the 4-way/emergency flasher switch and let it cycle 2 or 3 times.  The offending party invariably backs off smartly, apparently perceiving the flashing lights as brake lights.

If he/she returns to harass your bumper, repeat the procedure but try to randomize the flashes by manipulating the switch.  Be creative, it's your life and property that are threatened by that insensitive, unthinking, jerk.

"Modern" drivers are programmed to reduce speed and pay attention [albeit briefly] in response to flashing lights in their face.  It's a classic involuntary response [Pavlov's dog comes to mind].  Feel free to manipulate that response to your advantage.
