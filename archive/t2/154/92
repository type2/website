Subject: exhaust questions.

I have a 1978 champagne edition westy w/ very bad exhaust.  I am going to 
convert to the 72-75 stock system.  I already have the heat exchangers and 
some sort of valves (black and look like elbows w/ a vent thing on one end)  
I have the stock system coming from bus depot. 

Do I need anything else?  gaskets, tubing, bolts, anything?

Thanks for your help...also will this system and the heat exchangers bolt 
right into my stock 78 engine, or will any modifications need to be made?

Thanks again.
