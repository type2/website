Hi, 

I know the subject if off topic, but I am getting a
lot of e-mail with the klem virus from listmembers
addresses (including from the type2.com domain). It
would be wise to check your computers for viruses
using the latest anti-virus data normally available
from the anti-virus software websites.
Happy Busing,

Rogelio
