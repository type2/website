Subject: Re: [T2] Virus infections...


I am certain a list administrator will echo me on this but... rest asured
the list is not sending you viruses. It is most likely a virus in your own
system that is using your address book... I dont know much about these
things but you can be sure about that.

Hi,

I know the subject if off topic, but I am getting a
lot of e-mail with the klem virus from listmembers
addresses (including from the type2.com domain). It
would be wise to check your computers for viruses
using the latest anti-virus data normally available
from the anti-virus software websites.
Happy Busing,

Rogelio
