Subject: Wiper Juice coming out my Steering Wheel.


Hello,

I tried to get my wiper juice working for the first time, and when I
pressurized it, juice started coming out of the steering wheel.  Is this
normally wired this way?  Has anybody else had this problem?

Thanks for any help on this issue.
