Subject: Pearls of Wisdom for a Novice Engine Builder?

List,
After the votes of confidence I received from this 
list as well as other forums, I am ready to take on 
the task of assembling my own engine.  The case 
cracked on Speedy's last engine, so everything came 
out.

Two themes have stood out the most: be patient, and 
measure over and over and over.  I picked up the How 
To Rebuild Your Aircooled VW Engine book prior to 
breaking into this venture.  It has been invaluable to 
me as a novice.  Any other words of wisdom?  Any rough 
spots you guys/gals have run into while doing a 
rebuild?  Anything you wish you'd done differently?

Thanks in advance.  This list has almost been more 
help than my trusty Bentley manual!


Later,
