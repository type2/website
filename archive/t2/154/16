Subject: [T2] Subject: Modern Brake Switch

	Gee, I thought the switches on the master cylinder WERE modern!

	Lets take a look at the stated requirements here:

	Steven Sharpe, being tailgated, wants to notify the fool behind him 
that he's slowing down. Steven feels his brake light system responds too
slowly and that endangers him since the fool will crash into him.

	Rationality test: When left in gear or going up hill, Steven's
bus will doubtless start to slow down when he lifts from the gas,
so there might be a second between when he starts to slow and when
the brake lights come on. Can a second matter at 55mph? Sure. 55 mph
is 81 feet per second or so. Several bus lengths.

	Suggestions so far: 
	Pedal location switch with hair-trigger setting
	Gas pedal lift-off switch
	Flash emergency flashers
	On-dash LED to tell you when your brake lights are on
	
	I'm pretty conservative about thinks like brake lights, so I'd like
to recomend the following: whatever Steven installs, it should be IN ADDITION
TO the standard wiring and switches. Leaving the old wires and switches IN 
PLACE HARMS NOTHING, and will work even if the new and improved stuff fails
somewhere down the road. There's even a high-tech phrase for it: "Wire-OR".
If you have the standard master cylinder switches in place and add a hair-
trigger switch that senses brake pedal position, use the additional switch
IN PARALLEL with the existing switch. Then either one will do the job, and
you won't suddenly have NO brake lights if the new, improved, switch goes
bad or comes loose or whatever.

	Here's the concept. And no, I'm not sure the whether the master cylinder
switches provide +12 or ground... My recollection is that the back-up lamps
are grounded by the switch in the tranny, it can work either way.

	       New & Improved 
              Switch
          _____/ _____
    +     |          |
     _____|____/ ____+---((-at-))--.
    _|_  Master Cylinder      |
     _       Switch           |
    ___                       |
     _                        |
   - |________________________|
  

	And my personal choice would be for a new and improved switch mounted
right on the dash that you can tap any time you feel like it. If you like
the HOWAS concept (Hands On Wheel And Stick) you might put the switch on
the gear shift lever...

	If you DO use an LED telltale, remeber that LEDs turn on MUCH QUICKER
than incandesance lamps. You'd be closer to what the people behind you see
if you just use an indicator lamp, 12V type.

	Happy Motoring!
