Subject: 3rd brake light

I installed a "third eye" a couple of years ago.
Made a huge difference. Mine just comes on with 
brake lights... I can see a bit of red in the
window through my mirror so I know when it is coming
on.
If that doesnt work I slow down. If that doesnt work
...hell, I just pull over! I figure anyone angry enuff
to be on my bumper I would just as soon get
away from.

----------
I plan to install a flashing third brake light.
I've come to realize that most people are now almost
totally dependant on seeing that third light to
recognize that you're braking. I figure that 
if I make it flash, its more likely to get their
attention.
