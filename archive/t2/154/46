Subject: Electronic Ignition Alternatives Question

Check out www.groups.yahoo.com/group/megajolt Whilst this system is still in
development it shows great promise and will be very adaptable. It will be
able to be configured to run from a normal distributor that has been locked
just to control advance, from a toothed wheel to run a waste spark
distributorless system, or from a toothed wheel and cam sensor to run one
coil per plug. it will be fully programmable from a pc and accurate up to
16000 rpm (I think that is the figure). There may be a group buy for kits in
the future so it should be reasonably cheap to construct. Well worth a look.
Paul.
