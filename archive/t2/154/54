Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic Ignition Alternatives Question

I have installed the 79 electronic ignition in my 78 and it's very easy and
very nice. I did not have to do anything with the distributor drive, but
when timed correctly (8 BTDC, vac retard unconnected) the vac can is right
up against the flap control rod.

On the Megasquirt list I have heard of the Megajolt. Just as the Megasquirt
is a DIY EFI controller, the Megajolt will be a DIY ignition controller.
I'll tell you right now, these kits are not for the faint hearted :-)
