There is nothing to modify to put the 79 Cal ignition in any typeIV bus
engine. It is a drop-in swap. Only tough part about it is moving the dist
drive about 90 degrees.

For this you would need a knock sensor system. I don't know of any that will
interact with the Bosch electronic ignition of 79-83 vintage. 80-83 Cal
Vanagons used an idle stabilizer to change timing at idle, but it had no knock
sensor.

79 -83 Calif version vehicles.
The 68-79 Bentley has a section on it. There is more info on it in the 80-85
Vanagon Bentley, starting on page 28.8.

Yugos used Bosch ignition. But no knock sensor. To use it in a VW, you have to
modify the housing to fit the VW case. But why?? You would gain nothing. The
factory VW system works as designed.

No clues.

No knock sensor is accurately tuned to tune out engine noises other than
pinging. You ought to see what happens to timing when a timing chain stretches
on a Mercedes V8 and starts tapping on the head! The knock sensors are mounted
at the base of the cylinders. The noise telescopes thru out the block. Even a
hydraulic lifter screws up the knock sensors.
