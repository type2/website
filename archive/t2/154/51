Nemo, the stock shocks were Boge. Note my 72 still has the originals in 
proper functional order. You will not get that kind of durability, much 
less the custom matched functional criteria, from the aftermarket stuff 
designed to be cheap in comparison and general in specification. Poorer 
function and shorter life are not the road to reduced cost per mile, over 
the long haul.

If you want, I'll check on availability and cost for the real deal Boges. 
Even good condition original Boges from the junk yard would be better than 
new junk. Find a chassis you can bounce test and pull some good ones.
