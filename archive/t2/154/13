Subject: Re: [T2] tail light probs

Hi Chris,

Darn, I jus love these electrical short questions. It takes all day working
on a bus to trace one using a multimeter, trial and error etc. ... but long
distance diagnosis is easy ...

The short under the dash may be related to the brakes. I would suggest
turning the headlights on and then jiggling the wires under the dash around
to see if the brake lights flicker. If they do try tracing the wire from the
headlight switch -- it should be black and white -- to the dimmer relay to
make certain it is clean.

Cheers,

John R. --  '70 Westy
