Hi Class...have a problem i need some help out on. 
when i turn my headlights on, my brake lights come on. 
when my headlights are off my tail lights work fine. turn signals and brake lights work fine. but when i turn my headlights on. the brake lights come on and stay on. so i can't see my turn signals or my brake lights of course. 
any ideas? do i have a cross or short wire somewhere? duh.
i have another short, i believe, in my fuel/warning guages also. but as long as i don't mess around with the wires under my dash that short doesn't seem to be a problem at the moment. something that i will definately be lookin into tho, when i get off of the road.
anyways..any help u can pass my way would be much appreciated. thanks in advance, and a gr8ful peace out to all of u wonderful vwheads.
