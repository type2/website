Subject: RE: [T2] The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems

I'll be using something like the Ignitor but coupled with a unit called 
Safeguard that is specially built for Corvairs (which unless they have a 
modified combustion chamber have a tendency to detonate on modern gas) that 
retards the ignition for EACH cylinder in real time based on a knock sensor.

It allows better tuning and adjusts for times when that tuning and 
conditions lead to detonation. It also has a display that tells you which 
cylinder is getting retarded and how much in real time. That way you can 
tell if you have mechanical problem as well.

I'll have to safe up my pennies and dimes though 'cause it ain't cheap. It 
is favored by the folks driving turbos and Ultravans. Ultravans are HUGE 
lightweight campers based on Corvair mechanicals and built like an airplane.

Refinement, refinement, refinement. If it's going to be on the road as a 
daily driver, I want some refinement. Power (I didn't say speed), noise, 
and handling all need attention. All happening very SLOWLY.
