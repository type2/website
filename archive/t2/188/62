Subject: Re: [T2] Fixing Oil Leak

Hi Bob --

I tried to clarify that point in the second paragraph of my original
posting. There was no trace of oil leakage on the short vertical surface
just below the flywheel, and while I didn't remove the flywheel, I did peer
behind the edge of it with a light and there was no sign of any oil having
dribbled down from the flywheel ("main") seal (sometimes also wrongly called
the "rear" seal?). In other words, it was dry between the flywheel and the
front of the engine case.

I really think the oil sitting in the sump is just slowly finding its way
down through, between the case halves. I'm using 10W-30, BTW, and it even
seeps while the engine is cool and unused for long periods. I'm used to it,
but was trying to do better, and I've read of other people "fixing" their
oil leaks.
