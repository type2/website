Dave, have you actually tried this?  I have, and my conclusion is that a 
Vanagon shortblock will not work well in a baywindow because the case is 
different.  It does not meet up with the baywindow fan housing 
properly.  If you want to be able to seal the engine compartment, you must 
use a 72-79 engine case.  Well, I guess you *could* use lots of silicone, 
duct tape and innertubes but do you really want to use a kludge like that?

Also I believe the rear motor mount bosses are different (although it has 
been so long I'll admit I can't remember for sure).  You have both 
available, right?  Take a close look.  The vanagon motor mounts are larger 
and I think they mount differently to the case.

I ended up taking the easy way, which was to remove the crank, rods, cam, 
etc. from the vanagon case and put them into a baywindow case (a 72 case 
actually, which came from my '72 Westy that I bought from Jeff 
Schneiter).  I call it the easy way because despite the large amount of 
work initially, I have gotten six good years of service from the engine so 
far, and it looks completely stock.

Sorry Rob but I don't see any easy way out for you.  You are going to have 
to spend either lots of time OR lots of money to get your bus back on the 
road reliably.
