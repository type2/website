Steve,

So you're telling me that if you stick your head into the engine 
compartment and look in front (FIF) of the fan housing where it meets the 
block, that seam matches exactly all the way across?  No gaping hole there 
where the curves diverge?  I have a very clear recollection of a problem in 
this area.  I guess it's possible that they changed the case, I think mine 
was an '81.
