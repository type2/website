Subject: Painting muffler

My Hecho en M=E9xico muffler I bought locally to get my bus running is
starting to burn off the paint after only 2 months.  (I have nice heater
boxes and those triangular flanges, thank you).

When I bought it I figured I'd have to paint it but I didn't realize it
would be so soon.  Will high-temp spray paint (1400F), the kind they use fo=
r
BBQs and such work ok, a la Home Depot, or do I need to find something
specific to handle exhaust heat?
