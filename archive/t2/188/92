The paint doesnt last on any of them. You can use BBQ paint but will have
to respray as it doesnt last. I just keep the can in the bus and shoot it
whenever iti looks bare.  Maybe whenever I need to replace it Ill
get the SS original style one.
Could be awhile, this one is german and I salvaged it from a rotton free
bus I got. Its about the most solid durable muffler Ive had.
