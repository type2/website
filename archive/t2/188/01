Rob,

Looks to me like the top part of the valve guide.

The part that sticks out above the boss in the head on the valve spring 
side.  I suspect that you/they?  were lucky that the valve actually stayed 
on the spring.

I might also suspect that the head that you have may be incredibly 
cracked.

Please take pics when you get it out...this is gonna be interesting!

Cheers, dave
