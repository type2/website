Subject: Powdercoating rims - another opinion

This came from the Corvair list from one of the "old" pros.



"I agree with the other post that powder coating is little more than a more 
durable
paint... but in my experience both posts are right. I always retorque 
resprayed
steel wheels a couple of times...and they most always need it. Just a good
practice reguardless.



But even more important is retorquing aluminum wheels... especially the 
kind that
use flat washers. The Minilites on my Corvair required continual retorquing 
for
the first couple of weeks... and retorquing after nearly every run at 
Blackhawk
(which I ran only a day after mounting the wheels.)



But even aluminum rims held on with conical nuts require retorquing. I 
added used
chromed aluminum rims to my Cadillac a few months ago... and retorqued the 
nuts
twice. And then forgot about them.



Then this week I noticed I was missing a lug nut. I took the opportunity to
retorque all the wheels... almost every lug nut was dangerously loose.... 
gotta
love these Chicago roads...



So periodically recheck your lugs!!!! Painted, powdercoated, or raw aluminum."
