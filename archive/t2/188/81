David

Why does the L-Jetronic fuel pressure regulator in my bus sample the air 
input manifold pressure?

If the vacuum line to the regulator is removed and blocked would the engine 
run richer? Would the vacuum drop.

Is the differential pressure at the injector tip the signed sum of the air 
manifold pressure and the fuel manifold pressure?

Is the differential pressure at the injector tip held constant by the fuel 
pressure regulator control loop?

If the differential pressure is held constant would fuel delivery per 
injection pulse be affected by changes in manifold pressure?

Is the function of the fuel pressure control loop to control the 
differential pressure at the injector tip?
