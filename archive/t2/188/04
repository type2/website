Ed,
Interesting.  I wrote to suggest that he should replace the Beetle injector
figuring that if the Vanagon is a 2.0L engine and the Beetle a 1.6L engine,
the Beetle injector would not flow enough fuel.  However if the flow rate is
the same, maybe it doesn't matter.

Only the CA model '81s have oxygen sensors.
