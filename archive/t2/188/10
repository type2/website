Dear List,

Mary Beth and I enjoyed so much last year, as we travelled and camped all 
over Western Canada and US.

On several occasions we conversed on the topic of just how we might ever be 
capable of handling the knowledge of our inadvertently making the mistake 
of setting the beautiful forests on fire that cradled us each night, should 
that ever happen.

We simultaneously loved and worried so much for the fragile beauty that we 
enjoyed.

Bus Folks, as you camp this Summer, please be so very careful.

Be careful on the road as you drive your beloved bus,
and be especially careful as you walk away from your "extinguished" fires.

You and your companions are irreplaceable.
Your buses are irreplaceable.
Our forests are irreplaceable.
.
