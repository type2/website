Richard,

Yours look better than my 78, but I have 132k on mine.

I had low compression on #1 and #3(70-80#) but the leak down test
was really bad only on #1.

Fuel rail pressure is in the Bentley and IIRC it should be about 35# or 
so.

Cheers ,dave

My elevation is 5000 feet. A leakdown test showed significantly 
more leakage in the low cylinder than the high cylinder. 
Oil in the cylinder brought the low reading to 120. How bad is this? Is it time for an overhaul yet?
