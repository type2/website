Thanks to everyone who replied.  I got thinking about it because I was wastching the custodian here at work clean the sink with 3M stainless steel cleaner and polish.

One thing I found I thought I'd mention, is Barkeeper's Friend.  It's an inexpensive powder you can get at the grocery store. It's great for removing rust stains from pots, pans and sink areas.  I assume you could use it for cleaning rust out of the camper sink but so far I've just used it to remove the rust stains off my shoes and clothing when I acid treated my rusty seat frames.
