 OK, I'm giving up on the idea of fitting a headliner
to my 70' sunroof Kombi. There are just too many=20
unknown attachments.
 So... I've been reading in the library about installing
Baltic birch panels, as in a Westy.
 Does anyone know if the 70' Westys were made=20
from sunroof models with the roof cut away leaving
the lower sunroof pocket?
 Not too long ago someone on the list had a pattern
for the plywood panels, still have em?

TIA, Jako
