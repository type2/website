Subject: Canadian Tire - Propane Tank - Retrofit

Up in Seattle last year we saw a really neat small size propane tank that 
some Canadians had in their bus.

Basically it is a 3.89 KG (approx 8.6 Lb, empty) propane cylinder.

So, we bought one very first thing from Canadian Tire as soon as we entered 
into BC.
It fills a really nice need for our bus camping as to size and function.

Given the new US law effective April 1, 2002,
I suppose I need to plan on .............

begging for illegal refills,
pitching my nice sized new tank,
trying to refill the tank myself somehow,
or see if I can lay my hands on an overfill protection device (OPD) valve 
assembly to retrofit into the tank.

The tank is manufactured by Wolfedale Engineering in Mississauga, Ontario 
(9056) 275-4948.
Markings on the tank are:
3.89 KG
Model TC4BAM17 WOLFEDALE ENG. M-8903 01 01 WC5.26L
SND 349219

Are there any Canadians on the list that might call Canadian Tire for me,
or contact the manufacturer to see if an OPD is available for this really 
nice properly sized bus bottle ?

Or might a list member have a Canadian friend of whom you could beg 
assistance for this question?

I would imagine all that is required of me is to unscrew the old style fill 
valve and put in an OPD style,
if I can just get one that is proper for the tank.

Thanks,
Bob Perring
