At what rpm is your bus idling during these readings?
What is your timing set to?

Both of these will drastically affect vacuum at idle.  Raise your idle rpm 
and advance your timing a little and watch your readings go over 15".

Try this - extend your gauge until you can read it from the drivers 
seat.  Get on the freeway and get up to speed.  Take an exit ramp and lift 
completely off the throttle, allowing the engine to slow the bus.  Note 
vacuum at this point.  When you get down to 55mph, downshift to third and 
again allow the engine to slow the bus.  Note vacuum at this point too 
(should be the same, might be a bit higher if rpm was higher).  Now if the 
reading is ~20, you have low vacuum, probably worn rings.  If it's 22-23, 
you're probably in okay shape.  If it's 25+, you have a very healthy 
engine.  Kind of like a compression test in reverse.  Come to think of it, 
if you suspect your engine, give it a compression test and let us know the 
results.
