I was watching Charlie's Angels, the film, last night(please, no comments on 
taste;it was on cable), and noticed the destruction of a 72(?) bus in the 
race-car chase scene.  It made me cringe.  Is this what we've become?  Film 
stunt fodder? The vehicle looked like it was in great shape(until they 
slammed a Ford into the poor thing). It seems like it wasn't that long ago 
that you saw busses everywhere.  Now they're like an endangered species.
