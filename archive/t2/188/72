I don't know if the stock regulator supports this.  In normal operation, 
the answer is no.  There should never be a push action which would raise 
the fuel pressure above what it would be with zero vacuum at the port.  The 
only time you would see this would be with a supercharger or turbocharger, 
and the regulator would have to be capable of responding to positive 
manifold pressure.

True for pump variations, false for vacuum and atmospheric variations.  It 
is my understanding that the function of the regulator is to maintain a 
specific fuel pressure for a given load on the engine.  The vacuum signal 
is used to determine the load on the engine.  More vacuum means low load 
and therefore a leaner mixture.  Less vacuum means high load and therefore 
a richer mixture.
