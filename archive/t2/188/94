Any hints appreciated!

What is your timing set at? [at idle]
Retarded timing will give low vacuum.
Also cam timing affects vacuum.
Remove the left valve cover. Rotate the engine IN the direction of rotation
and watch #3 valves. You will see the exhaust open then close. Immediately,
you will see the intake open. Stop and turn the engine back until the exhaust
opens [or keep turning two revs]. Go in the direction again and JUST as the
exhaust closes and the intake JUST starts to move, STOP. Look at your timing
mark. It should on zero. If not, your cam timing is off.....

getting short.

I believe I have a decent used one you can have.
