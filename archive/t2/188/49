Subject: F/S Gadget to monitor O2 Sensor output.

Greetings and Salutations;

	If you are interested in a gadget to monitor the output of the oxygen
sensor check out the Vanagon Tech link on my Web Site.
http:\\neksiwel.20m.com\   I have a few left over after building a batch
of them for the guys on the Vanagon List. P-Mail me with questions. I am
selling them for $20 plus $2 postage anywhere in the USofA. 




Drive Safely
