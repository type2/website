Subject: Re: trip to oregon coast

Hi Tom --
I just got back from another camping trip to the Oregon Coast, and heading
north I noticed what looked like a nifty VW boneyard/repair barn in the
little town of Beaver, OR.  I have noticed this place -- it's called Beaver
Creek Bob's, I believe -- several times over the years and was looking for
it again this time, and there it was.  Many old busses encircle the place.
Beaver is well north of Newport and about 10-15 miles south of Tillamook on
Hwy 101, which is approximately an hour or so south of the Washington
border.  It is on the left side of the road on the north side of town as you
are heading south...

>>I am taking a trip to the oregon coast.  Unfortuantley, Zeke, will not be
joining us this trip.  Can any one point me to some VW yards along the route
from Spokane, WA to Newport, OR?<<
