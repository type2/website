Subject: Dodge City, Kansas


I've heard there is a kick butt little VW parade in Dodge City, Kansas, on 
the 4th of July.  Anybody have info on this event?  I'll be in that area and 
would like to bring my little Westy over for the morning.

Thanks.

hell of a good time.  Sometimes this makes planning the day a little
difficult.
