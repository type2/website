Hiya JJ,

Apologies to The List for this use of bandwidth, but it does have to do with 
Busses and parts.  

JJ, When I tried to reply to your latest e-mail it bounced back to me 
courtesy of DAEMON.  So here it is again........

Hiya JJ,

I can do the pack and send thing.  At least, I think I have a box big enough 
and the packing for it.  However, I wanted to let you know that I am in 
Portland.  And, if you were planning on being down this way, it might be 
easier (cheaper too) just to drop by and pick it up.
Let me know what you think.............

Mike
