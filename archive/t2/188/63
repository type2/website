If it is indeed 'seepage' from between the case halves, anything short of a 
teardown is iffy.  Permatex makes a sealant that is just for this purpose, 
but I can't attest to its efficacy, since I've never used it myself.  If you 
deduce that it isn't your mainseal leaking, try it out and let us all know 
what you think.
