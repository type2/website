Subject: Colorado VW (can we say VW ?) events ???

Hi Folks,
    I'm going to be visiting relatives in the Denver area and was wondering
if there will be any VUU (veedoubleyou) events in that area between June
28th and July10th.  Shows, campouts, I don't care, because I'm sure the VUU
crowd out there is just as good as the folks here on the east coast.
