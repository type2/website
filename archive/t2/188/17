My 78 Westy showed readings of 120, 120 , 120, and 105. My elevation is =
5000 feet. A leakdown test showed significantly more leakage in the low =
cylinder than the high cylinder. Oil in the cylinder brought the low =
reading to 120. How bad is this? Is it time for an overhaul yet?=20

Another question: what should my fuel rail pressure be?
