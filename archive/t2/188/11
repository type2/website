Subject: RE: [T2] On a hunt for used 74 parts. (help me get to HCBF cont.)

Yo!  Jay!  I have the parts my friend.  The foam seal, yes, it is important,
in keeping with the emails that went on around this yesterday.......Jay, I
got my seal out in one piece bro, and it has been saturated with oil almost
the whole 2 years it has been in there....it's nice and soft and really in
awesome shape!!  I think it would get you two more years my friend....but
that's my opinion.  I took the 3 rear tin pieces off too....you may not need
all three, but I'll send em anyhow.  Also, I have the air breather for my
Holly two barrell in the package!  Yes!  It's a nice chrome little jobbie
and I think it would look sweet....I bagged all the screws and washers for
everything, so you should be able to pull everything out of the package and
put it right in man!  HaHA!  There is a gasket for the air breather that
goes between the bottom piece that bolts to the carburator, and I put that
INSIDE the breather so it wouldn't get bent or broken.  It is a bit bent
right now so I didn't want it to get totally busted.  Be careful taking it
out of the air breather.....it'll be good for a while tho man......the air
filter itself is something you may want to get, but this one, in a pinch,
will get you to High Country man.  It's all there and complete.  I'm totally
excited that you'll get to High Country, and I'm totally happy over the fact
that parts of Yoda will live on!!  They're good parts man....enjoy.

I'm gonna ship 'em to you from, uh....uh hum....shhhhh.. (work)....so don't
worry about the shipping.  The parts are yours for nothin' guy.  I have the
address below....look for the package tomorrow by fed ex....I'll mark it so
they will leave it without a signature.

Toasts!!

Dustin
'74 Yoda.....lives on.
