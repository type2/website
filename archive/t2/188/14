Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering

Greetings All,
The staff at the host campground, Rustic Knolls are extremely excited,
looking forward to the hippie invasion on August 9.  The entire campground,
approximately 100 folks, are having a tie dye class this weekend.  They will
be out in full force, and wearing the official "Dixie Bus Gathering"
uniform.
I will be updating the web site soon with the necessary particulars of what
to bring and what to expect.  If you haven't already, mark your calendars
for August 9-11 in Central Ohio for Dixie Bus Gathering.
For those of you that have show quality, (heck, any quality) and want to
enter your bus in the Central Ohio Vintage Volkswagen Club Volksfest show,
be sure and make the trip.  This show is so large and well respected, that
VW Trends and another mag, do an annual write up and pix.  You could be
world famous, just by coming to Dixie Bus Gathering.
I will be requesting a quick note from those who intend to make the trip so
I can judge the area needed, and of course since I am supplying the Official
FMBC champion "German Air Cooled Chili", I will need to know how many expect
me to feed them.

Respectfully,

Frank E Biffath III
