Subject: Springs camping in North FL, USA

Folks, I've reserved a campsite at O'Leno State Park for Fri-Sun, July 12-14, for a weekend of hanging out on the Santa Fe / Ichetucknee and
various nearby springs.  This "event" is meant to follow in the tradition of the irregular Love Bug campout some of you have participated in before.

There's no real plan, just a two-nighter in the vicinity of some excellent springs.  If you're a canoe/kayak/tubing/snorkeling/scuba person, you'll find 
plenty to do.  If you're a sit around-and-do-nothing afficionado, you won't be bored either.

Florida's state parks now allow you to reserve specific campsites either online or by telephone.  My site is #18 in the Magnolia Camping Area in the 
park (there are two loops - this is the one closer to the river).  It's about $20/night for one with electricity -- handy if you want to bring a fan or two.  My 
experience is that while this is peak muggy/buggy season here, spending plenty of time in the cold springwater and having a fan in your tent makes it 
pretty tolerable.

There are two ways to make your reservation:

1. Call 1-800 326-3521.

2. If you're even a little web-savvy, go to http://www.dep.state.fl.us/parks/district2/oleno/index.asp and  click the "ReserveAmerica" link, which
takes you to a website where you can browse available sites and make your reservation online (you have to  create a free user account there first, it's
simple).

Hope you can make it!  If you would, drop me a line if you decide to join us so I can get a rough idea of who to expect.
