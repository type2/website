Yes, they will interchange with no problem.

Yes.  I still think you should rebuild the heads you have if that one head 
is salvageable.  Clean them up, new guides, new stainless exhaust valves, 
swedged seats.  If you must swap them for rebuilts, pay attention to 
combustion chamber volume.  Once a head has been milled, you can't 
guarantee anything - valvetrain geometery and compression will be different 
and potentially troublesome.  Rebuilt heads should also be matched in terms 
of combustion chamber size and valve size - assume nothing and measure 
everything.  If you don't have a vernier caliper, get one as it is 
extremely handy for measuring things like pistons and valves.

They will bolt in.  There are significant differences (clutch, flywheel, 
displacement, valve size, cam profile) but it should run.  I would not do 
this for a long term solution though.
