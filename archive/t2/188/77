Subject: flat spot

Hi Volks my van has an annoying flat spot just off idle. The ignition and 
carbs seem ok everywhere else. I have thought about altering the throttle gap 
to try to eliminate it but which way should I go wider or narrower. I would 
experiment with a C02 meter but I haven't one available!  The van is fitted 
with solex 40 pdsit carbs it being a porsche 914/412 engine but the principle 
is the same right? Any thoughts and or theories? TIA Mel
