Hi.

www.everybus.com

It's Tuesday and time is running out! EB is just a day or two away. 
Check the web site for a bunch of additions to the carabus page and 
the activities page. The weather is looking absolutely perfect: no 
rain with highs around 70 and lows in the 50s. I can't wait!

See you there!
Chris
