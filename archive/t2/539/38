73 Westy.
What goes in this spot/hole?  It's behind the pass. bulkhead and I am guessing for the slider door curtain elastic.  I'm assuming it must be similar to the teacup hook on the closet but looks like something bigger and round was there?
All responses, PICTURES, or actual part much appreciated!  Thanks, -Chris
