Hi Elise,

You're in for a shock... The old heavy canvas ones sell for as much or 
more $$$ than the new ones.

The quickest and easiest place to find an old side tent is on eBay or 
www.thesamba.com. Figure on $500US.

The BEST place to find one is at a local want-ads or a garage sale 
where the owner doesn't know what it is. $50US, but don't hold your 
breath waiting for it.

Either way, best of Luck.



Happy trails,
