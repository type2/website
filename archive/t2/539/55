My new line of side tents will arrive in roughly 3 weeks.  I will have a
$199 version and a $299 version. (Prices are estimated, and may vary
depending on actual landed cost.)  My $199 tent is an upgraded version
of my previous $199 tent. My $299 one will hold its own to $700 tents
sold elsewhere. Frankly there will be little reason to buy anything
else, unless you are a stickler for originality and want a used vintage
tent.

Details to follow in a week or two.
