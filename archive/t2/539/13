Hello.  When I and others say something like 750C or 1670F, like below, the 
'degree' little 'o' that was cut-and-pasted shows up on the type2 message as 
a number zero,  not the intended superscripted 'o'

I wanted to say 75-degrees-C or 167-degrees-F


The hint should be that 750 degrees C does not equal 1670 degrees F [750 
degree Celsius = 1382 degree Fahrenheit], whereas 75 degrees C DOES equal 
167 degrees F

But thanks for all the responses to my messages.
