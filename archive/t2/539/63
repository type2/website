I'd also think twice about blasting the pistons--just for the same
reason.
A good soaking in Hydro Seal--and a hot water wash would do the trick
with less possible damage--

Then a ring groove cleaning--and reassembly would be adequate---

Is bead blasting pistons a common practice? Seems it would be possible
to have residual blasting media stuck in the small passageways in the
piston and come loose and damage the engine. There are many horror
stories of powder coated oil canisters depositing residual glass beads
into and destroying a newly rebuilt engine.
