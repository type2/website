Subject: More Westy Seating

Hi Folks,

I know it's a little late for this thread, but I had a different but related 
question.

I have a '79 Westy, and I have removed the sink cabinet.  I like the larger 
amount of space, and I can get by without running water and a sink when I'm 
camping.  I still have the icebox cabinet and Z-bed, but was thinking about 
increasing the seating capacity when I'm not camping or hauling.

Does anybody know if a regular middle seat will fit between the Z-bed and 
the front bulkhead?  If the icebox cabinet is still there, it looks like the 
seat may be a little too close to the bulkhead, but it looks like there's 
*some* room for it.  I figure I could remove the seat for hauling and 
camping, and put it back when driving around town.  I could fit more 
passengers, and rear-seat passengers wouldn't be quite as far away.

Any thoughts?  Anybody have a 2/3 middle seat for cheap?

Thanks!
