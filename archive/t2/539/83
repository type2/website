My bus has a lot of rust.  Up until tonight I was considering a rebuild
for it.

Last night I stopped at a house with a 74 westie sitting in front of it.
I had tried calling over the winter a few times and no one returned the 
calls.

It's a 74, all original deluxe westie with one exception. It has a 2liter
fuel injected motor in it. It's an automatic.  It's immaculate. No rust 
whatsoever.
literally.  Comes with a side tent, the mosquito screens for the rear door,
even the original icecube trays for the dual powered fridge. Canvas and all
is immaculate.

<sigh>

Do I go ahead and do the motor in mine? Or save the money and sell my bus
for a little, adding the amounts together.. raising a little more and buy 
the nice
sparkly one?

I would take it in to get the motor checked out.
The owners are quite particular to who it goes to. Guess they refused to 
take
to quite a few people who stop by and ask about it. Lots of sentimental 
value,
memories of their old dog and stuff.

<sigh>

Thoughts?
If I were to skip the rebuild I would sell mine and be honest about it 
possibly
needing some work in the future.
