A chamfer is an angled cut between two right angle surfaces.  A good
example is the multiple chamfer cut into a valve seat.

The assumption here is a new piston and a new cylinder.  With a used
piston and cylinder you will want to take multiple measurements to be sure
that both the piston and cylinder are round.  Especially measure the base
of the piston.  The "skirt" (the two extensions on the base) has a
tendency to get pushed in which distorts the piston.

A boiled rag is a total waste of time.  Heat the face of the piston for a
good minute with a blow torch. Heat it until the skirt is warm. Take a
?13?mm socket on an extension (this will depend on the exterior dimension
of your sockets, YMMV) and apply it to the end of the wrist pin.
With a towel or pot holder between your hand and the piston, support
the piston and push the pin out with the socket. Do not let the big end of
the rod bind on the crankshaft. I know that you will be replacing the rod
bearings but this is just good practice.  NEVER use a mallet on or near
the crankshaft.

USUALLY the wrist pin will slide right out of a warm piston.  Sometimes a
ridge has developed in the hole from the retainer banging its groove and
the pin is a positive PITA to remove.  If this occurs then you may either
build a wrist pin extractor if you plan to do this often or take it to a
machinist.

A wrist pin extractor can be constructed as follows:

Obtain:
a piece of 1" pipe that is 1.5 times the length of the wrist pin,
a piece of all-thread longer than the pipe plus the wrist pin,
two nuts for the all thread, and
two washers.  One washer should be a fender washer bigger than the end
of the 1" pipe, the other will be slightly smaller than the wrist pin hole

Shape:
one end of the pipe to match the piston.  If you use plastic or copper
pipe this need only follow the curve in a general way although the closer
the better.  If you use iron it will need a much closer and better finish

Assemble:
the all-thread goes through the pipe and wrist pin,
the small washer and one nut go one the end of the wrist pin,
the larger washer and the other nut goes on the other end of the pipe

Tighten the nut on the pipe end to pull the pin into the pipe.

Ridge reaming is done to prevent damage to the top compression ring and
its groove in the piston.  As the old rings rode on the cylinder they wore
it very slightly.  As the rings wore this wear receded into the cylinder.
Your new rings do not have this wear and they will reach further up into
the cylinder.  The differences in diameter are usually too subtle to be
detected by anyting other that a 1/10,000" bore micrometer but they are
present none the less.  If you have a sensible ridge it is usually a sign
that the cylinder is worn beyond reuse.

Frankly I am opposed to reringing in volkswagen engines.  While it may
work it strikes me as penny-wise.  You have invested a lot of time and
money in getting to this point.  Add the cost of rings and machine work to
ream and hone them and the cost benefits are small.

750C does not seem like a lot of heat?  Steel melts between 1200 and 1500C
depending on the alloy so at 750C you are halfway to melting your pistons!

With new pistons I have never had to do more than warm the piston.  I use
the same procedure for insertion as removal.  I warm the face with a
blowtorch until the skirt is warm then insert the pin.

                             OOK!
