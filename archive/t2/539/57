Subject: Engine swap for a 1970 bus

Please post the following question:

I have a 1972 Bus with a 1700 cc engine and transmission.  I just acquired a 
1970 bus with no engine, but was told it was a 1600 single port.  It has the 
transmission still in it.  It is in better overall condition than my 1972 and 
wondered if the 1700 cc engine would fit in the 1970 bus.  Would I have to use 
the '72's tranny too?  Does it require any conversion kits?  Thank you in 
advance.

John
