You probably dissolved some corrosion on the throttle shaft (on it the shaft holes) with the carb cleaner. The corrosion was taking up space. Now it is gone. It is probably a vacuum leak source now and may have been part of your surging problem. Another possibility would be inconsistent fuel supply - volume - not pressure. Maybe something floating around in the tank blocking fuel flow?

With old carbs either you need a larger throttle shaft to match the larger worn throttle shaft hole or find a tighter less worn carb. I have a buddy that rebuilds Corvair carbs often. He has a selection of bodies and shafts and mixes and matches to find a tight combo. He says the shafts wear faster than the carb bodies. Dunno if that applies to VW's but it should b/c I think the materials are the same. 

Lastly - you could bore out the ends of the shaft holes to a slight depth to fit an 'O' ring on each end of the shaft. 

Last possiblilty from me: valve sticking so 1 cylinder is occasionally low on compression b/c the valve is leaking compression. Power comes and goes. 

Good luck.
