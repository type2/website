Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Port - What does that mean?

T,
Dual ports mean there are two intake ports on the cylinder head (one for
each cylinder). Easily identified by looking at the intake manifold where it
enters the head. Single ports split the intake inside the head, dual ports
split outside the head (you'll see a split in the intake runner just befor
it goes into the head). Basically, this provides for less restriction it the
airflow between the carb and intake valves, providing more power at higher
RPM's.
