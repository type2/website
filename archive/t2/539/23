Subject: sunroof drain clog

     My 74 has a sunroof.  The drivers side metal drain is really clogged, 
right about where it bends to go into the door pillar at the top (just after 
the plastic tube).  I have tried several times with coat hangers, sink 
snakes, magnets, high pressure air, and those flexible nut and bolt grabber 
things to get it flowing again.  I am afraid to use chemicals or acids 
because I don't know if there may be pin holes in the tube or if it will eat 
up the metal of the tube.  Should I try Draino or something?
     My last resort will be to cut the inside of the door pillar to gain 
access to where it is clogged, cut out a section of or possibly the whole 
tube, and then weld it up again.  This is allot of work of course, so any 
suggestions would be appreciated.
