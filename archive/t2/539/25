Nice trip report Clara.

See youse volks (-at-) BYOB also, but will be going incognito in a  SWX subie
powered Vanagon(I know, I know!) that belongs to a friend of mine. W/ CA gas
prices, it is actually cheaper for me to fly into Oakland from Salt Lake
than drive my DC (not to mention the 3 days of driving).

Hope to come by Red Barn Friday nite to visit, check out any early finds,
etc. but will be staying in St. Martin up the road overnites between the 2
shows.  Really looking forward to this annual trip, but will miss the 803
mile one way drive!

Pax,

Tom Buese-will try & bring a couple of tilts for sale/display
