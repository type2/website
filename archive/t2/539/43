Subject: Warm Start Problems

I had a starter problem last night for the first time - engine /starter
turning over very slowly - today I checked all my connections cleaned them
up and so on
I have settled on the fact that I only have this problem when the bus is
warm - lots of starting juice when the bus is cold - sluggish starts when
warm ( after 15- 20 mins of driving)-like a dead battery- soon as the bus
cools - starts no
problem - any ideas of what may be going on here ?

Thanks
Eric
