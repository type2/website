Are you sure...?-(
If you're gonna pay "a lot" for a rust-free Bus, be sure to spend
"a lot" of time inspecting it...Get under with an ice pick and poke 
around "a lot" to see if there's rust under the sparkly paint...
Even original paint can hide "a lot" of rust...And undercoat is
also suspect...Once it cracks, it becomes a perfect storm for
rust...Holding the moisture against the metal and concealing it
from enquiring minds...
