James,

My personal opinion only......

Buy the best body you can possibly afford to start with.

If it is truely "rust free", then the rest of it is a piece
of cake....(from someone who does NOT do bodywork).

Repairing bodies is much more expensive to me than all ofthe 
other stuff put together.

Only drawback that I can see is the automatic, but you can rectify that 
later if you want to.

I can buy a 2liter stocker outright for less than a crappy paint job.

Think about it...


Cheers, dave
