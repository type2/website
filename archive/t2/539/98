Subject: Re: [T2] Decison -opinions needed

I think the point isn't a defensive one to be made here.
The bus Im looking at they want $4000 Canadian.. convert that
to US at around what $32-3500 ish?

It's not a ton of money. I just don't want to be nickle and dimed
fixing rust and have it end up costing more than this one.  I can
let someone with more funds do that ;)

I don't want to strip mine and junk it cause I don't have the space
for parts, the bus can still bring me a nice chunk (relatively) and help
for a deposit on the new one.

<< I have a rusty bus too.  I could afford to go buy a shiny perfect one.
Then what would happen to mine.  It would likely soon become a piece of 
rusty
waste somewhere.
