Subject: RE: [T2] EveryBus Carabus Question - Fuel Prices

You guys should check http://www.flyingj.com you can look up gas prices by
state. I alwas use this site to plan my gas stops, there are several
"Flying-J" truck stops on the way down to EB..

For example here is the Ohio Gasoine prices

GOOD luck..

I'm going to try to make it but it looks like the TaxMAn may be taking my
travel money...
