Rich,

shocks have absolutely nothing to do with the ride height of your
bus.  the springs (in this application, torsion bars) are worn out.

it is possible to adjust them, but unless you are an experienced
mechanic, that might be better to have a professional do it.

some folks have mentioned using Ch*vy Astro coil-overs on the rear of
their bus & they might chime in on this thread.

good luck,
