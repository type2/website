Subject: Euro gas bottle and other parts needed

Hello all,

I need a few things that appear rather hard to come by - I hope that someone
coming to Everybus can help me with these:

- European-style propane bottle. These are usually red or gray-and-red - I
need the small (5 kg?) size. When I shipped my 74 Camper from Germany I
forgot to bring my gas tanks along and the US propane bottles do not fit
into my gas cabinet. Does anyone have one of these sitting around? I'd love
to use my stove and fridge again ...

- 76-79 brake booster. Condition does not really matter. I need a
rebuildable core to send it to the rebuilders in Texas.

- Gas pedal with hinge piece. If you have a parts car in your driveway, you
are my man/woman for this ... The hinge part is spot welded to the floor.
Just undo the linkage by unhooking the spring, flip up the pedal and drill
out the spot welds in the hinge part.

Thanks a lot,
Marcus
