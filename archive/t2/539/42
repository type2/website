Subject: Re: [T2] motor swaps

Hi James,

The 2L motor will install fairly easily into a 73 bus. I have had a 1.7 
a 1.8 and a 2L in my current bus.... which isn't a 73 but it does tell 
you how interchangeable they are. There may be issues regarding intake 
and exhaust, but if you are working with a COMPLETE 2L you should have 
few problems. If you are planning on installing parts from your current 
1.7L FI motor onto the 2L then you will have to be more specific about 
what you're using.

The 2L will probably come with a 225mm flywheel, which will not fit 
your current tranny. If you put the 210mm flywheel onto the 2L you will 
be fine.  Or you can swap bellhousings and starters. Swapping 
transmissions is much easier than swapping engines, but you still  have 
to do a motor drop to swap a tranny.

If you're changing the tranny over as well I would suggest you also get 
the linkage between the stickshift and the transmission, because the 2L 
tranny is longer than the 73 tranny. If you install the 2L's tranny you 
will find that the shift lever is moved too far backwards to reach 2nd 
and 4th. You can correct this by instlling a shorter linkage, or by 
shortening your existing linkage.


Happy trails,
