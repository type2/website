Subject: RE: [T2]Camping question(Everybus){camp stove}

     Hey, finally something I can help with!  I've been using Coleman stoves 
for years now through scouts and all the way up to camping with friends now. 
  Coleman has product specs here:

     They say you can run both burners on high for about an hour.  That is 
pretty close to right but it also depends a bit on the quality of propane 
cylinders you have.  I cook for 8-10 people during a normal camping trip on 
one of these (which means heating bug pots and pans) and go through about 
two cylinders in a three day weekend.  Of course I also use a campfire for 
at least two of the meals.  I'd recommend you buy four or five cylinders 
though.  Reason being, you sound like you are going to continue camping, and 
they don't really go bad.  Might as well have two left over at the end of 
this camping trip to use them on the next one than run out.  They are fairly 
inexpensive as well.
     Use some common sense with the propane cylinders.  They are not exactly 
volatile, but I wouldn't store them in my bus for long periods.  I keep mine 
in the basement where they stay cool and dry and toss them in the buss with 
the rest of my gear before I go.  I imagine as long as you didn't store them 
in the engine compartment or anything dumb like that you'd be fine though.  
I know they can set out in the sun until they are too hot to touch 
comfortably by hand without blowing up, although it's probably not a great 
idea to do that :-)  Also, I think they have all the care and handling 
instructions on the cylinders.


Hope that helps!
