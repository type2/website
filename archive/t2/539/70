Mr. Berk,

Your Volkswagen engine is by modern standards an antique.  Today the idea
of one pipe on the intake manifold feeding more than one cylinder is
absolutely unheard of.  But for all volkswagens prior to 1971 that was
just the way it was.  One carburetor sat on top of the intake manifold and
fed the air/fuel mixture down to an inverted "T" one branch of that "T"
fed the fuel mixture into the left bank of cylinders and the other fed the
fuel to the right bank.  There was a single port in the top of the 1/2
head and a second port in the top of the 3/4 head.  In 1971 Volkswagen
introduced an engine with the same single carburetor and the same inverted
"T" manifold but in a concession to "new fangled" the ends *divided* and
each cylinder got its own intake port!  These engines are by custom
refered to as "dual port" for the two intake ports on each head.

These days the number of single port engines left running is slim indeed
and unless you are a true "vintage pervert" if your volkswagen is running
a type 1 engine then your volkswagen is very likely running a 1600 dual
port engine.  1600 (actually 157?)ccs displacement and two intake ports on
each head. The single port heads are still available and I prefer them but
they are not as common as they usedto be.


                             OOK!
