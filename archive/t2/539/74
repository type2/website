I have heard of it being done. I have never done it.  It is effective at
removing the carbon cake from the top of the piston and the plastic media
used is soft enough not to damage the steel.

Err... there are no "small passageways" on a piston.  Although it is a
very high precision piece of machine-work the smallest "passageways" are
the ring grooves which are more than a millimeter wide and deep.  They are
unlikely to retain any media particles with reasonable cleaning.

First there is a big difference between "bead blasting" with glass beads
and "media blasting" with plastic beads. Second there is a big difference
between an oil canister and a piston.  While I am not all that sanguine on
reusing pistons as I said in a previous post I would not object to
cleaning them by blasting with plastic media once a "command decision" has
been made to reuse.

                             OOK!
