Does anyonwe know of a bearing retrofit for Solexes? I have yet to see
that done.

> With old carbs either you need a larger throttle shaft to match the larger worn throttle shaft hole or find a tighter less worn carb. I have a buddy that rebuilds Corvair carbs often. He has a selection of bodies and shafts and mixes and matches to find a tight combo. He says the shafts wear faster than the carb bodies. Dunno if that applies to VW's but it should b/c I think the materials are the same.
