Subject: RE: [T2] Hydro Seal

Awesome this is what I was looking for and at the bottom of the sheet I 
noticed this:

Radiator Specialty Company
P.O. BOX 34689 / CHARLOTTE, N.C. 28234 / TELEPHONE 704-377-6555

You can't get much closer than this. I live very near to Charlotte, I go 
there almost daily.

Hopefully by this weekend I will be up and cleaning again.

A BIG THANKS to  Terry and Sage.

TravelOn,
