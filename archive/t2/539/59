Subject: Dual Port - What does that mean?

Hey, I won't know till I learn, and it's confusing me because I 
understand things from an 8 valve vs 16 valve or even 20 valve per four 
cylinder world. But from PORTS I know nuttin.

According to the Samba Online VW Dictionary;

"Refers to the number of individual intake passages into the head.  Dual 
ports have 2 per head".

So, any body want to 'splain in words of few syllables?
