Subject: Vanagon diesel dipstick

I've just finished with a Jetta conversion on an 85 Vanagon, using an 86  
cabrio engine.
 
I need to know the length of a Vanagon diesel dip stick?
 
Or do I cut the shaft down to make the one I have, work.
 
What a power difference. I think VW could have sold millions if they did  
this.
 
thanks
