Subject: Re: [T2] Where the hell is IAC???

It has to do with the install of the php forums - im sure the webmaster is
working on it, and accidentally uploaded the intstall folder/files, which
gives that error, and therefore making the entire site unvisable.

I would contact the webmaster - having a brainfart who manages the IAC.

Good luck!
