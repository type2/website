Subject: 72on upright engine tin

I may have found a good source for upright engine tin for late bay buses. I
can get a few of these from a guy in Germany. Question is: which pieces does
one absolutely need - i.e. which tin pieces are not identical with early
bays or bugs? I am a type 4 guy - the last time I messed with upright
engines was at least 10 years ago ...

A list - or better - link to a diagram would be great.

Thanks,
Marcus
