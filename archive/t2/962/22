	Even if it is, there are good reasons to do it yourself.  Try 
to get the oil & filter for free from the dealer, by all means; but 
don't let the dealer do (or pretend to do) the oil change.

	Ramps are hardly needed when your vehicle has the generous 
ground clearance of the noble T2.
	What filter??  The VW quirk of boycotting proper oil filters 
is an extra reason to drain the sump when the oil is  HOT  i.e has in 
suspension particles that will settle out while the vehicle sits 
cooling for hours at the dealer's before they get round to draining 
it.  Drain that muck in the hot oil, for goodness' sake.
