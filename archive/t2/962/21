Much worse happened to me after an oil change at a Firestone auto center (a
pox on them). The mechanics took my Jeep to lunch and "went wheelin". Tore
up the drive train so badly that it was totaled. They said it was a test
drive and "a pre-existing mechanical condition" and made me tow it home.
They are no longer in business but it didn't get my Jeep fixed.

NEVER TAKE YOUR VEHICLE TO GET AN OIL CHANGE UNLESS IT IS UNDER WARRANTY AT
A DEALERSHIP!!! Buy some ramps, a wrench, oil and a filter and do it
yourself!!!
