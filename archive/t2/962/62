Subject: Re: [T2] bad news (holding tranny for engine pull)

You can use a chain and u-links to hold the tranny on an earlier bus. 
But in our 71, I would let the engine and tranny down together to make 
it easy to see behind the fan housing and get at the upper nuts.  I put 
a concrete block under the tranny to take stress off the cv joints. 
Secret to making this all easy is to drive the bus up onto (home-made) 
ramps about 3 3x6 thicknesses, allowing the tranny/engine to be parallel 
to the ground for easy pulling backwards and pushing in of engine.  Set 
the height of the block for this with extra boards on top. I used 2 
scissor jacks on each side of the sump plate, which stood on a 2x3ft 
board resting on 3 broomstick handles- the engine pull is easy, as it 
rolls the board on the broomsticks- pull out the free one, place in 
front.  Reinstall is the reverse, with a sledge used to tap the board 
and align everything even when you are alone.
