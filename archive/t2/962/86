Subject: 73 bus automatic Transmission rebuild kit?

Hi,

I found a rebuild kit for $199.  The transmission doesn't need a rebuild, but
I'm going to do it anyway.  I installed a bigger engine and I want the
trans to be
in the best shape possible (subaru EA81 + 1987 SPFI)

Are there better prices ($199 seems like a pretty good deal to me)
Are there better parts to buy?  Anyone have experience with rebuilding
the automatics, and opinions of which parts are best?

Am I going to need special tools?  I have the VW instruction/service manual,
but I haven't looked at it closely yet.  It has good pictures and
rebuild instructions,
I'm just wondering what tips and tricks you (type2 mailing list subcriber) have.

Rich
