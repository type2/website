Subject: what socket

I bought a new cv boot kit from bus depot.  I am having trouble finding the
correct socket for the new bolts.  Checking out the library, it says it uses a
"tri-square" socket.  People in my little town look at me like I'm crazy when
I tell them it's not a Torx..."yeah but it will work"...

I will probably have to order this one on-line.  Just wondering if there is a
source and what size I should order.


Thanks for the help.
