 >So, this would only leave vacuum as a possiblity, right? But this is a dual
carb eninge (36-40 PDSIT - no central idle circuit) with no emissions
contols, so the only vacuum connections are the distributor advance, balance
pipe, and brake booster connection. How can I have a vacuum leak in this
setup that would affect #3 only? The brake booster connection is on the
balance pipe - it is closest to #3 but it should affect the opposite

You certainly can have a vacuum leak affecting one cylinder. The leak 
can be where the inlet manifold meets the head. I am fighting one of 
them while we speak! However, mine does not have the nice attribute 
of going away at high revs. :) (Mine is also on the dreaded weber 
prog with which any resemblance between the inlet manifold and the 
intake ports is purely coincidental).

To check if a vacuum leak is your problem you need to spray something 
flammable (starter fluid, WD40, etc) on the suspect areas (including 
underneath). When you hit the spot the revs will noticeably rise. I 
have found it is easier to locate if you reduce the idle speed to the 
point where the engine is starting to run a bit roughly. The effect 
of the cylinder kicking in then becomes very obvious.

Cheers,

Martin.
