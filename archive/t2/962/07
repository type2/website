Summary : JL did not
- change fuel filter
- change tranny fluid
even though customer paid for it (on various cars)

district manager denies being the district manager and looks a lot
like a dickhead

They did not show the part where the 'technicians' use the impact
wrench to put the oil nut on and repair with JB weld after destroying
the oil pans :)
