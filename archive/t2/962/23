Subject: Re: [T2]Alternator belt problems

well it looks like i will be missing work this am to go to the alternator shop to let bus rest and take alternator back off at alternator shop and let them put the pulley on right so my belts wont keep breaking and twisting... if it wasnt for the bad luck i dont know if i would have any luck or not...
   
  lets hope that does the trick...and i can keep a belt on there after this...
  sure wish i could get this doen without removal of alternator but looks like it will be easier to do out of the bus ...
  lot of trouble for the alternator guys mistake...
  hopefully he will own up to it..and take him 5 minutes to do if that...
  thanks
  chai
