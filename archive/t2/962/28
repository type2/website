Just to remind you that VW stopped the oil filter boycott when the Bay
Window started using the Type 4 based engine in 1972 (at least here in the
USA).  From then, a spin-on oil filter was standard equipment.  But yes, the
oil should be drained hot, even with an oil filter equipped engine.

       What filter??  The VW quirk of boycotting proper oil filters
is an extra reason to drain the sump when the oil is  HOT  i.e has in
suspension particles that will settle out while the vehicle sits
cooling for hours at the dealer's before they get round to draining
it.  Drain that muck in the hot oil, for goodness' sake.
