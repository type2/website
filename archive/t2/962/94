thanks.  got her to idle today by dialing out the idle control screw
pretty far.  temp. fix, i know.  checked timing and it was waaaaaaaay
off the, the, that thingy w/ the #'s on it that tells you btc and atc,
damn't why can't i remember it's name.  oh, well, maybe when the heads
where pulled and reattached something got messed up.  despite this i
took her for a test drive w/ all the gauges hooked up.  sorry, only
one head temp VDO sensor gauge, not four, one oil pressure, and one
oil temp.  all read within "specs", except the heads, which read a bit
high.  makes sense since the timing is probably advance too far.

the new hankooks are awesome.  amazing what they do to the ride.  no
wobble at all.  the new oem shocks are so so.  nice soft ride but dips
on the corners like a canoe in waves.  the dipping lessened the more i
drove, so maybe they just needed to be primed, for lack of a better
word.

anyway, loved driving goethe again.  other drivers probably thought i
was stoned w/ the big, dumb smile i had the whole time.  but %$%&#(-at-),
it was fun to drive after looking (-at-) her as a driveway weight for eight
months.

any ideas as to why the timing would be so high?

thanks,

jeremiah
