Yes, it should. Have you opened it and checked that the sponge in
there is clean and the hose to your intake is unobstructed?

I've seen folks put clamps on the dipstick tube, but I like the idea
of it being kind of an emergency release valve. Otherwise you start
blowing seals that require a teardown to replace.
