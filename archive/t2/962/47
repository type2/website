Ok, a little late on the Friday post I suppose.  Anyhow, as geeked  
out as I can be sometimes, I am only just now watching 'Pirates of  
Silicon Valley.'  I know I know.  But in the first 10 to 15 minutes  
or so it shows the early pioneers of computing getting pulled over in  
the bay window westy.  Good stuff.

Peace, Troy
