Kevin,

I have successfully rigged up a 200lb ratcheting tow strap with hooked
ends to hold the tranny up with the engine out. I needed to be able to
roll the bus around while I had the engine out for a top end rebuild
and a jack wasn't going to suffice. The tricky part is figuring out
where to place the hooks, I seem to remember some frame members worked
well.
