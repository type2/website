Subject: Re: [T2] what socket

If absolutely necessary you can use an allen wrench on
the CV bolts...use the one that fits best.  The
correct tool is preferred, too much allen-wrenching
will strip the the socket.

On this subject...make SURE you use backing plates
(three per CV) and brand-new lock-washers (available
from VW dealers) when you re-install the CV bolts. 
Also don't use anti-sieze and keep the bolts and their
holes free of CV grease.  Otherwise you will have CV
bolts falling off...ask me how I know. After having
several CV joint's fall off, I also add 10-20% to the
published torque value.
