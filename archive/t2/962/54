Subject: [T2]76 Alternator wireing can anyone help?

i am rewireing my alternator wireing... 76 hightop.... weber carb  soooo non FI....
   
  there are a red/green/black that come from the regulator...
   
  they go to the back of the alternator..
   
  then there is a big red wire that goes from the starter to the back of the alternator right? but to nothing else?
  i think it is just running from back of alternator to starter though...?
   
  also the small black wire that runs next to blue wire at firewall....?
   
  that black wire connects to what wire ? the black on the red/green/black wire set..?
   
   
  i have looked at the bentley but am not seeing the answers to my questions...?
   
  thanks for any help with this if you can make sense out of what i have just said...
  peace
  chai
