Subject: Local Paint & Body Shop in NE?

Hi all,
Need recommendation for a decent paint & body shop in the Boston/New 
England area.
My 1978 Champagne Edition II bus has minor rust issues and needs new 
paint. I do not want show/restoration type work, but a place who has 
some experience with buses and can be trusted to do good work for 
reasonable cost. Please reply on list or off. Thanks.
