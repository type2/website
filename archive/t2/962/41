Subject: Re: [T2] Dipstick Tube seal?

go to lowes or your local flaps and look for a small little black ring ...
  you should find them in the help section and just take your dipstick in with you...
   
  honestly though if there is oil shooting out of the dipstick i would think that you need to figure out something else?
   
  i think it was mark dearing that told me you can stick a rag into the top of the crankcase to check for the right crank case pressure...
   
  start there,....
  i do use a small little ring on my dipstick but it just helps to seal it better when its pushed in.. it wouldnt stop anything strong in force of oil.... 
   
  i ran my hose from the air breather on top of the crankcase to the outside under the battery tray instead of in my carb and the crankcase pressure balanced and i now have no oil shooting out my dipstick...
   
  you can also use a old glass peanut butter jar...
  poke a hole in it and run a piece of gas hose down in it and then hook a clamp on the other end and stick it where the dipstick usually goes and drive like that for a bit and see how full the jar is getting... ? that is also what i did before i finally got it to stop blwoing out the dipstick...
  narrow it down to WHY
   
  good luck..

Hmmmm...I don't suppose that item is available anymore :)

Do you think a piece of fat string or twine would work?
