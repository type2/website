The reason I mentioned the front shift rod bushing is
that it is a MAJOR cause of transmission noise in the
cabin area. If that bushing is worn through, the steel
shift rod is making direct contact with the steel
housing directly below the shift lever. What this
means is that all of the tranny noise that is usually
only heard by the squirrels in the engine room is now
transmitted to the cabin area and seems to be somewhat
amplified as well! It is easy to check if that bushing
is worn through. It is hard to see, but once you have
removed the front belly pan, you can, while lying on
your back, reach up there and move the end of the
shift rod around with your finger. If it moves around,
the bushing is shot and a new bushing will make your
radio audible once again! Shifting will return to
"smooth and precise" and the whole world will be
lovely wnad wonderful. Once again. Really. I've been
there a few times and it really works this way.

If the front shift rod bushing is not shot, I just
don't know what to tell ya! -BaH
