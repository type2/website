Well, the Bopmobile has gotten a lot louder.  I stuck my hand under it and felt hot air coming out from around the RR heat exchanger.  Is it common to blow those things out or did I just blow a gasket?  I haven't had a chance to jack it up to where I can get to it and isolate the exact location.  I sure hope its just a gasket as the heat exchangers are over $200 a pop.  It's got the 1.7L motor.  Thanks...KR
