OR, a triple square socket, depending upon what the bolts take,  Allen and
triple square do not interchange!

I use OEM serrated washers and backing plates and reuse them with no
problems.  I think that the original serrated washers and plates are
superior to the "new" stuff coming along now.

I use anti-sieze and simply retorque the bolts to the factory torque
values after driving a few miles.
I've heard enough horror stories about stuck CV bolts that I don't want to
risk those things siezing up.  One more crawl-under is well worth it to
me and I've never had a joint loosen up on me after the retorque.
