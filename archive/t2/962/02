From your site listed above:
"The carb, a 30 PICT-2, has what looks like a welch plug on the back
of it that will weep a tiny bit of gas if you pump the pedal a few
times. I've applied a few layers of old-fashioned gasket shellac (the
brown stuff) to see if that will cure it temporarily. I've also
discovered that the rearmost stud has stripped out it's hole in the
carb base, & it's impossible to completely tighten the base. Seems to
run OK though; need to take a vacuum reading to see if the base gasket
is leaking. I expect I'll need to replace this carb."


I had this problem on my 34PICT3, it happens when someone tries to
over tighten the nuts which hold the carb to the manifold. My fix was
to pull the carb, remove the stripped stud, find a new suitable stud
at the FLAPS, then using 2-part epoxy on the threads of the new stud,
permanently reinstall the new stud to the carb. Been working now for
over a year. Cheaper than replacing the carb or using some type of
threaded insert or re-tapping new larger sized threads for a stepped
stud.

hope that helps
