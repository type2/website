In the old Beetle engines, cylinder #3 was wont to overheat because the oil
cooler blocked the air flow.  VW "solved" the problem by retarding the spark
to #3, supposedly lowering the temps a bit.

This is not a problem with the pancake engines (or a Type I with a dog house
cooler).

Well, these electronic points aren't working so I just want to run with
stock points for now. I'm not familiar with cyl 3 retard issue. And is
changing the plugs around reasonable or should I just return the
distributor? Shouldn't they all be the same?
