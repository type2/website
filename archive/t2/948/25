If you're into British Iron, you know the Morgan...Last of the Tea-
Baggers...'30's styling still in production...The newest variant is 
the Aero 8 (Google it up...;-)
The Aero 8's styling is an upgrade on the TC/Morgan's...Wings/
fenders and that long hood/bonnet and the distinctive upright
radiator grill(e)...But like your faux TC, the grill's fake...It's there
just for the styling, the air intake, like most modern cars, is below... ;-(
