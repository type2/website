The MotoMeter. Very interesting.

Two years ago, wanting to expand my ACVW horizons a bit and also to 
satisfy an unrequited love from my youth (Is my age becoming obvious 
here?),  I bought an MG TD kit car. This is a fiberglass shell stuck 
on a Bug frame with a 1600 DP engine.

If you happen to remember the TD shape, it has a huge radiator up 
front, fake of course for the kit car.

Nevertheless, the detail on this replica is such that at the top of 
mine is a gadget that looks for all the world like the MotoMeter.  It 
is line of sight for the driver so he can continually monitor the 
temp of the fluid. Of course, one would need the eyes of a 20 year 
old to do.

The car is under winter wraps at the moment. When the thaw comes, 
I'll have another look and compare it with the nice brochure that 
Jules posted.
