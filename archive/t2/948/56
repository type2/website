my keys still in it. How you ask? My son had just been born and I was doing
the new-father-zombie-thing. The lock cylinder on my Jeep is so worn that
sometimes if the cylinder is just right, you don't need a key to start it. I
got all the way to work before I figured it out.

At least the Shell station dude was cool and held onto them for me. What is
really funny is that I did it again the next time I filled up! At the same
station with the same clerk. :) !!!

The second time was the last time I did it though. Not fun re-keying your
house locks twice in a month...
