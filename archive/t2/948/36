Subject: RE: [T2] Stock Exhaust choices

George,

Wow, that is an excellent price as well! All the hardware, damper pipe and
exhaust tip is included! Everywhere else has all the parts separate. I'll be
ordering one today.

I'll do a write-up on my site on the comparisons between the two products
and an install guide. I am also going to modify the clamp style attachments
to flange-style for easy removal and for use of better flange-style gaskets.

Can't wait to see the quality difference.

Jon

If you can get the Liestritz system from Bus Depot:

You will find that it bolts up very nicely.  It seems to have a longer
service life than the cheaper options.

I notice that Ron has appended a /Ernst to the Liestritz in the ad.  You
might check ahead to see what manufacturer he is actually stocking or if
the manufacturers have merged.

Avoid Mexican or Brazilian mufflers.  The money you save won't be worth
the extreme hassle of making the parts fit.
