Subject: RE: [T2] high octane gas

High octane gas is for is vehicles with high compression ratios. It keeps
them from pinging (or pre-ignition) by causing a more controlled burn. Since
our air-cooled engines are very low compression, it is not necessary and can
be quite a money burner. If your cooling fan is working, tin is all in
place, your engine is sealed and thermostat/flaps are in working order you
don't need the benefits of high octane.  

Jacques, you may want to ask the mechanic what he did to you motor that it
needs high-octane. If he increased the compression over stock, you may be in
for more problems than you need.

He also may be reading the sticker on the gas cap door that says 91 RON
only. That is equivalent to 87 octane.
