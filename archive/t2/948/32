It's wider, but you also have to consider the section height.  A
195/75R14 is a bit smaller in diameter and also a bit wider than the stock
185R14

If the tire size does not have a section height number (the /75 above),
The section height is assumed to be 82 or 83  This means that the section
height of the tire is 83% of the width.

What this boils down to is that a cover that fits the stock 185R14 tire
will also fit a 195/75R14 tire.

That is to be expected, because the 185/75R14 (which is _not_ the stock
size!) is the same section height but a smaller width than the 195/75R14.
The rolling radius would be smaller, though I suspect not 10% smaller.

You can look up tire diameter information for various sizes on the online
tire retailers sites like tirerack.com
