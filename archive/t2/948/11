Never been a fan of the Dansk muffler - alignment is poor and the paint job
they give 'em is just downright horrible.

Ernst is a much better muffler (that's all we [Airhead] sell)

Leistritz was another maker I used a lot in the 70s thru the 90s and I
recall they were of excellent manufacture and fit perfectly.  But it looks
as if they've gone the way of the "Dodo Bird".
