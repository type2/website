Subject: a new 6010w generator for my bus- new super beetle

Hello List,

Thing have been going ok here. I just purchased a
6010w Honda generator for my 68 VW Bus. i have decided
to mount it to the fron of the bus using one of those
baskets that slides into a reece hitch that I have yet
to mount to the front of the bus. I will keep the list
updated on my progress.

Also, i just purchased a 71 super beetle. I am only
familiar with bay buses. is there a email list for
beetles that i can subscribe to? I have a lot of
questions.

Take care!
