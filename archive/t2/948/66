hey Guys  Just remember that when installing these circlips that they  will 
have a flat side and a rounded side.  Think how they are made by a  stamping 
process that will create a rounded side on top and a flet side on the  bottom . 
Always put the flat side to the outside of the wrist pin. I have seen  these 
come out and eat the clylinder like you wouldn't believe. later  Mark  dearing
