Hi David,

Found this table at 
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/autos/gasoline-faq/part3/section-1.html

Under the heading:    What Factors Determine Octane  Requirement:

   Compression       Octane Number    Brake Thermal Efficiency      
     Ratio            Requirement         ( Full Throttle )
      5:1                 72                      -
      6:1                 81                     25 %
      7:1                 87                     28 %
      8:1                 92                     30 %
      9:1                 96                     32 %
     10:1                100                     33 %
     11:1                104                     34 %
     12:1                108                     35 %

Don't know what brake thermal efficiency is, maybe someone else does.  
At 7.6:1 a Type 1 slips in there
just a tad above regular and a notch below high test.  Maybe Plus ?

Cheers,

John R
