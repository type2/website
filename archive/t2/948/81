Subject: Re: [T2] Petronix & CA

I have a compufire w/ a stock coil in CA and never had a problem.  It's 
not affecting the timing or changing the tune of the car so I don't see 
why it would be an issue.  On top of that, I've never had a smog 
technician look under my distributor cap, or even know enough about the 
bus engine to want to venture in there.
