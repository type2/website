That was with a new distributor. When I put the old one back in I could set
it properly. But now it doesn't work.

Well, that's just what's got me flummoxed. I've gone through there over and
over again. I thought this would be a simple swap procedure. I few folks
have suggested a 180 degrees out thing, but you can't put these distributors
in the wrong way.

That's just it, the drive Cogs at the bottom of the new distributor drive
shaft are aligned 25 degrees or so different from the rotor, compared to the
old one. I would have thought this would be a fixed thing, regardless of
distributor. It's not like the drive is loose or anything.
