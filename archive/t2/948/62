Subject: Wrist Pin Keepers - need help finding source!

I am having trouble finding wrist pin keepers for my daughters 1975 bus. I
have no problem finding 22mm circlips, but I just cant find the 24mm size
which is used in the 1975, FI, 1800 engine. I also thought about using
Teflon buttons, but again, I could not find the correct size. Thanks. Steve.
