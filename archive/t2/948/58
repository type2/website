Hi Kevin,

I'm no expert but in general a high octane fuel is a more complex  
formulation,
and so ignites more slowly, although in the olden days lead could be added  
to
slow detonation.


This from Wikipedia:  Higher octane ratings correlate to higher activation  
energies. Activation energy is the amount of energy necessary to start a  
chemical reaction ... It might seem odd that fuels with higher octane  
ratings burn less easily, yet are popularly thought of as more powerful  
... However, premium grades of petrol often contain more energy per litre  
due to the composition of the fuel ... as well as increased octane.

This from Consumer Reports:  High octane gasoline burns slower than low  
octane gasoline. The slow burn prevents engine knock when cylinder  
pressures are high.

Cheers,

John R
