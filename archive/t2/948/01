John,

I was referring to advancing the timing at -idle- won't allow the piston to
gain combustion, which is true. At speed, advance is indeed necessary to
allow for combustion to start before the piston reaches its crest.

It's the ATDC, BTDC relationship that was reversed in my fingers-to-keyboard
communiqui.

:)

"No, you want the spark well before TDC, because the spark takes time to
fully
ignite the air-fuel mixture. The faster the engine runs, the greater the
needed
advance, as higher engine speeds means less time to achieve full
combustion.

7.5 degrees BTD at idle increasing to 32 degrees at highway speeds
is a normal range.

Cheers,

John R"
