Yes it is.

With the stock coil my experience has been:

- better idle
- better acceleration
- more power at higher rpms in each gear
- mild 1-2 mpg increase
- less maintenance (be sure to oil the wick in the shaft once in a while)

Pertronix won't do anything for CDI since it's only acting as switch. In fact, you can go back to points with CDI.
