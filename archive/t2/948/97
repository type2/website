My philosophy is that since the #3 cylinder runs
hotter, there is more danger of detonation or
pre-ignition in that cyl.  I have hills in my area, so
I run 89 (midgrade (-at-) sea level) to give me a little
extra margin.  If go on a mountain trip (long grades),
I put in the high-test to get even more marging for
error.
