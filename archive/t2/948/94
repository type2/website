Subject: Mega squirt

So, mega squirt is only for FI motors, somewhat like toyota employed on the
early MAS, engines, ...just a warm up, by enriching device, as opposed to Maf,
with "rich injectors" all around at startup?  My question begs the question,
FI only?
I am running "big" T/C Dels, and wanted to prepare myself for what I should
expect for "cool" climate starts, anyone have this setup on same motor?  "two
pumps", foot to the floor?
