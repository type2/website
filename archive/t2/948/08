Subject: Stock Exhaust choices

Currently there are only two manufacturers for stock 68-71 exhaust systems;
Dansk and Ernst

 

Which is better Ernst or Dansk?

 

The Dansk muffler I put on this '70 isn't even close to bolting up right. It
"works" for now but I don't want to buy a Ernst and find the same alignment
problems.
