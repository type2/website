Subject: Paint Job & Rust

Well, Pumpkin II is finally getting a paint job. I'm
removing all the trim, windows, and pop-top. The
exterior and cab floor is going to get prepped and
painted. There's some light rust (around a few
windows) and a little body work, including the
windshield lower lip (transplant from another bus).
I'm new to the prepping & painting thing (don't have
the facilities to do it myself), so I've got a few
questions...

1) Is $3,800 reasonable for this?

2) I don't want the rust to come back any time
soon...will standard prep & prep procedures hold up
well? The guy doing the work is a VW guy, so I'm
assuming he knows what's best.

3) I'm not doing the undercarriage now...eventually
I'm thinking of getting it sand-blasted (probably with
all the running gear installed) and applying an
under-carriage coating myself. My facilities are
limited, so it will be something I can brush on after
sand-blasting.  Any thoughts?

4) I live by the ocean (meters, not miles). Any idea
if an electric charge / sacrificial anode anti-rust
gadget would help in the long run?  The bus lives
outside, and the rust really went to the races after
we moved by the water...

Thanks!
