a fuel injected engine is called a FI motor.  An engine with carburetors 
is called a carbureted motor.  Or, to more precisely answer your 
question, many people have removed the FI setup from their engines and 
installed carburetors because they didn't have the tunability that they 
do with carburetors.  Also, many people have take their originally 
carbureted engines and installed FI (stock or aftermarket), and in some 
circumstances used throttle body injection instead of running separate 
injectors to each cylinder.  The reason that you heard of more people 
switching to carbs is because previous FI systems were somewhat 
cost-prohibitive before the MegaSquirt came out.  Now you have an 
amazing system for very little cost...
