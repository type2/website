Subject: Re: [T2] high octane gas

Learn something new every day.   I've rarely used it.  I was always proud of the fact that I didn't have to.  Especially with gas so high.  Over the years I've used a few tanks of the top Amoco gas.  Supposedly the best.  But in my sports cars, not in my bus.  Seems I do everything on the cheap in the bus.  Might have to rethink that.  Cheers....KR

Hi Kevin,

I'm no expert but in general a high octane fuel is a more complex  
formulation,
and so ignites more slowly, although in the olden days lead could be added  
to
slow detonation.
