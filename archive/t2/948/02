That is exactly backwards. The pulley rotates clockwise.

If you're using a pulley with degree marks (which is what you're 
describing - "on the pulley"), and comparing that to a fixed pointer on 
the engine, BTDC is clockwise (on the pulley) from 0.

At least on a stock AC 2.0 engine, there's a single mark on the pulley, 
and a scale fixed to the engine - with that setup, BTDC is 
counterclockwise (on the fixed scale).

Timing _advance_ is when ignition occurs earlier (more BTDC). What 
you're describing is timing _retard_. You're obviously confusing the 
two - a VW engine won't run 28 degrees ATDC at 3000 RPM.
