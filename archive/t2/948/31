	From my position 'off to one side'  -  I've had nothing to do 
with Ron's firm, nor do I particularly expect to  -  I would like to 
honour his scrupulous politeness & helpfulness.  He could easily, and 
so far as I can see justly, have been more righteously defensive 
about the 'bulk ambiguities' accusation.
	Youse yanks would appear to be very well served by this 
careful man.  I only wish we had such a firm down under.
