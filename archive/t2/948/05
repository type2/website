Thanks to you all!

 

After I stopped associating the words "after" with "advance" and I
re-checked my timing. 

 

It was 22 degrees centrifugal advance and 28 degrees with vacuum! 

 

After I adjusted it to 28 degrees centrifugal, I see the vacuum advance is
working properly with a total advance of around 38 degrees. Aha! My motor
just woke up! Tee hee hee hee hee. Much more enjoyable commute!

 

Thanks again!
