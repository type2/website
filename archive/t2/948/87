Subject: Buses by the Beach Bus BRR Next Week!

Hey winter bus campers:

Our friend Greg Potts was kind enough to pass along some winter bus camping
tips learned at the True Canadian Winter Bus Campouts.  Check out the link
to the Potts Family website below.  Thanks, Greg!  We'll hoist a LaBatt's or
a Molson in your honor around the fire!

The weather is looking good (same as last year!) high of 26F low of 15F
Saturday so we should be OK.

Looking forward to seeing everyone and some new faces this year!

Below is some basic info:


*Gate entry:  $5.00 Entry at Gate*

*Campsite with electric hookup:  $11.00 (We will again be at Campground #3)*

*Toboggans are $10.00 per hour.*

*Sunday Brunch at Pottawatomie Inn:  $12.50 per person*

*Being with friends around a campfire again:  Priceless!*


*3rd annual Buses by the Beach Bus BRR* at beautiful Pokagon State Park (
www.in.gov/dnr/*park*lake/
*park*s/*pokagon*.html<http://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/parks/pokagon.html>
) in Angola, Indiana!   Go to the Buses by the Beach website (
www.busesbythebeach.com
) and click on "Events" to see the 2007 Bus BRR flyer and cool pics from
previous years.



The fun starts this year at around 1:00 pm on Saturday, February 10th.  We
will have a big pile of firewood (please don't bring your own  Emerald Ash
Borer problems!) and start the crock pot chili (electric hook ups on each
campsite) when the buses are leveled, tops are popped and heaters are
started.   Then, it's off to the wild toboggan run for some 35-40 mph runs
on the refrigerated tracks.  Back to campsite later on for all different
kinds of chili, music and great bus talk around the big fire.   Make sure to
include the fantastic brunch at the rustic Pottawatomie Inn on your calendar
for the next day, Sunday February 11 th, before hitting the road.

Last year, the snow started about 2:00 pm and continued until about 10:00 at
night.   As we stood around the campfire catching up with old bus friends
and making new ones, the clouds cleared out and the almost full moon
sparkled on the new snow.   It was a great sight to walk up the hill, look
down and see all the cool buses huddled together in the moonlight with happy
bus volk around the fire.  Most campers lined their poptops with Mylar
sheets before bed and ran small electric heaters or kept the top down.   We
were toasty warm despite the 24 degree low that night.  Brilliant sunshine
greeted us the next morning as everyone contributed something to a community
breakfast around the fire.

Please feel free to email me with any questions or call my cell phone at
