Constructive criticism is always appreciated, Mark.  Of course you're right
that I'm not the best judge of what is self-explanatory. After all,
everything I know is self-explanatory to me. :-)  

I claim BusDepot.com to be the largest online catalog of VW parts, and
that's no exaggeration.  But out of those 200,000 or so parts on my site,
roughly 5% of those represent about 95% of my sales. I offer the other 95%
of them (often at little or even no profit) so that we can be a one-stop
source for your Volkswagen parts (of all years), which I feel is important.
Basically, the odds are that if the part is still made, it is on
BusDepot.com.

I do my best to massage the descriptions on that 5% so that they are as
clear as possible, and also include images when I can (that is a
never-ending and time-consuming process; we have over 20,000 images on our
site so far and counting). I am also working on crossreferencing, such as
the ability to type in a Bosch part number and see the VW part number as a
result. But when it comes to the less popular items, it's a very mixed bag.
Many of the descriptions are provded to me by the manufacturers or
importers, and while some are quite good, others are practically useless
(i.e. "lens," with no info at all as to what lens or even what VW it fits).


If any customer can provide feedback on any description they notice that is
either incomplete or incorrect, it would be HUGELY appreciated if you would
email me and I will update it immediately. The part may not be a big seller,
but it could be critically important to the next person who needs that
particular part (however obscure it may be). It could mean the difference
between him getting his VW back on the road, or not.

I also fear that many customers do not understand how to use the BusDepot
site. That is my own failing, as I designed the site (I'm the webmaster, the
network administrator, the buyer, the accounts payable manager, the
advertising director, the personnel department. etc.; when you run a small
business you wear many hats :-). Some people don't even seem to realize that
you can click on a product listing to see more details and an image, which
is a pretty basic web functionality on almost any site. Similarly, I don't
know if everybody knows to click on the green " i " icon to see more info on
some product categories (also a work-in-progress, but in some cases it
includes parts diagrams and other very useful data). I have tried moving and
clarifying the explanation for this in the page design many times, but I
feel that it still gets overlooked often.

Also, I fear that many customers do not understand our "SmartSearch" box,
which (unlike the search box on other VW parts websites) is
context-sensitive. When you enter a keyword, it searches only within the
level of the product drill-down that you are already in, rather than
globally throughout the catalog. (Basically it functions as a "search within
these results" option on any page you are on.)  I have clarified this
graphically, and created a "help" section for this at
<http://busdepot.com/help.jsp#SEARCH> that is linked from every page. But
still I think it is misunderstood or overlooked by many.

If this sounds like I need the input of a professional web designer, you're
probably right.  (Anyone want to trade web design for Bus parts?)  But I'd
also appreciate all input from end users, no matter how big or small. The
BusDepot website has a lot of flexibility designed into it, and while my
financial resources are very limited (I'll never be an amazon.com), I think
there's a lot more I can do toward making the most of what it's capable of.
Any and all input, suggestions, and criticisms are gratefully appreciated.
