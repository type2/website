Subject: stereo...cd player

Hello everyone, I purchased a cd player stereo system for my bus, and someone 
else told me they didn't think it would work good in it, that the bus would 
be too bumby for the cd player, something about it mounting to the frame in 
instalation....has anyone else put one in? I was wondering if this was crap 
or not, lol...he also said he didn't know if there was enough juice for the 
stereo amp and speakers. I'd appreciate any imput, hopefully she'll be off 
the blocks and on the road soon, but I gotta have that sound too!!
Thank you,
