Subject: [T2] Just got a no seatbelt ticket... has there been a study

Giles, I'll second what everyone else has said: you would be nuts not to use
your seatbelts!  I understand your non-stock seat makes it more difficult, and
the non-retractable VW belts are sometimes a pain to use, but ......
    Before I had my bus, I had a 65 Ford Econoline.  I was in the passenger
seat in the mountains as a snow storm was starting.  We were just about to
pull over and put on the chains, when we crested a ridge going north, and it
was colder on the north side, and nothing but ice.  We went into a four wheel
skid, and merrily slid down the road for about 150 yards when we crashed head
on into a car coming the other direction which was stuck.  The van then turned
90 degrees to the right, and slammed into a large embankment.  If I had not
been wearing my seatbelt, I would have gone through the windshield, and would
then have probably been crushed between the van and the embankment!
    I was also glad the friend who was driving was a snow veteran, and she
kept us from going over the left embankment, and into the trees by smartly
refusing to apply the brakes (which I would have done in the panic).
    Also, although the stock VW belts are more difficult to use than
retractables, I've always been somewhat distrustful of those -- what if the
device which is supposed to lock them when a lot of force is applied decides
to quit working during your accident??
    Anyway - use your seatbelts and you'll live longer.  End of lecture!  :-)
