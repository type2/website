Don't forget your VW says that you're anti-Nader which greatly increases
your chance of getting pulled over by "that" cop. ;-)

Get a shifter extension or swap the old seat back, please.

Here's some food for thought, you are the crumple zone:

I recall reading a VW history book that stated that VW took offense to
Nader's comments toward VWs in the last 60's and early 70's and crash tested
the bay window. VW reported that there were no incursions into the cabin up
to 30mph.  Saying it was safer than the split wasn't saying much.

Safety standards have gone way beyond the design of these vehicles and I
think it's difficult to rationalize safety decisions.
