Subject: Oil Pressure Light question

I had a problem with my generator light this past week.  I had a short and
it was glowing on and off. I thought oh know another electrical short (last
time took me weeks to find it) This time 15 mins :)  Seems the wires to the
voltage regulator had messed up.  One fried the insulation off and the other
was just disconnected, the glowing must have been when they touched.  Any
way I reconnected the green wire to a double green wire and taped up the one
that burned the insulation (wanted to make sure it was the cause before I
replaced the wire,  it was)  But now the oil pressure light isn't working???
Does the Voltage regulator have anything to do with the oil pressure light?
Or did I maybe disconnect something else while looking for the short?  I
tried Bentley and couldn't find the voltage regulator on the diagram
(electricals drive me crazy)  I noticed this on the way to work this morning
so haven't had a chance in the light to check everything out yet.

Any help would be appreciated...
