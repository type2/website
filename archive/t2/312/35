Subject: Re: [T2] valve spring compressor tool

When a poor grad student,I took a small prybar (with the slot for the
nail) and enlarged that slot using the side of a grindstone so it wound
straddle the valve stem but push down on the endpiece that holds the
keepers.  I now also have the tool (source unknown) that hooks under the
bar the rockers are on and has a pair of extensions that push on the
endpiece as yo pull down a long 10" lever.
