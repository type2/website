Possibly wrong with you focus on collision.  

I lost one of my best friends a few months ago in a vehicle roll over.  It 
was a sedan, not a bus, but the same priciples apply.  She had flipped the 
shoulder portion of the seatbelt behind her back, possibly for comfort or to 
adjust a coat, and died of head injuries when her face hit the pillar at the 
corner of the windshield.  She was other wise uninjured.  The coroner and 
state police felt she would most likely not have been killed if she would 
have been wearing both parts of the seatbelt correctly.

The loss of a friend causes you to pay much closer to attention to things 
like seatbelt habits.  I had been a passenger in her car previously and had 
watched her do the very thing that resulted in her death.  Yes, that was her 
decision to make, but a lot of people are going to feel the hurt of her loss 
for a long time to come.

BECAUSE I am so close the pillars and windshield in a bus I couldn't 
imagine_not_wearing one under any circumstances.
