You can buy the mixture ready made at a body shop paint store.
The kind I got was Sherwin Williams, but there are probably several brands. 
Ask the counter guy.

Just thinking of helping Jeff with his rust-mobile, and was thinking it's
probably cheaper to buy a jug of phosphoric acid and paint it all on. Anyone
know what dilution rate and/or a recipe to make a homemade rust
neutralizer??
Thanks,
Courtney
