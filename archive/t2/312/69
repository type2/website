Dupont has a product called Metal Prep--
Comes in quarts and gallons
Good stuff----

I usually apply it straight out of the bottle for a good cleaning of
bare or cleaned oxidized metal --but it is suppose to be cut----then
washed off with a damp rag---then dried, and then Zinc Chromate acid
etched primed--to seal the metal good.

You can buy the mixture ready made at a body shop paint store. The kind
I got was Sherwin Williams, but there are probably several brands. Ask
the counter guy.

Just thinking of helping Jeff with his rust-mobile, and was thinking
it's probably cheaper to buy a jug of phosphoric acid and paint it all
on. Anyone know what dilution rate and/or a recipe to make a homemade
rust neutralizer?? 

Thanks,

Courtney
