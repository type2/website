Subject: Re: [T2] CHT readings

Ohhh!  I like these gauges!  Saves the cost of the switch also.

Scott, I read the part about the thermocouple wire in the other post 
and after having used this stuff many years ago, I agree with your 
observations on it.

The problem I have is that I have never seen one of these VDO sets....I am
betting that it has a "cheap" thermister type sensor rather than the 
"real" thermocouple wire.

Do you have to add wire to the kit to get it to go all the way to
the front of the bus?  If you do have to add wire, then wouldn't the
junction where you added wire give you the same problem as a switch?

Someone please set me right on this one....I might want to add a VDO CHT
gauge to my bus and would want to know before hand!

Cheers, dave
