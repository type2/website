Subject: Re: [T2] tire pressure in '71

The tire pressure for any vehicle is found on the tire
side wall. Any tire pressure that is given in the
manual was ment for the factory tires which I doubt
are still on your bus. For instance, the tires on my
bus require around 60 psi (please don't assume yours
are the same) where as most passanger car tires are
around 35 psi. See what is stamped on the side wall.
If I am incorrect, please feel free to correct me as I
like to learn too. If it is not on the sidewall then I
am stumped too.:)

Good Luck and have a great day!
