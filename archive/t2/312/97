Subject: RE: [T2] tire pressure in '71 

Hello All, 

I don't think the reply to Jack's request is right. The tyre pressure marked on the tyre is the max pressure that tyre is designed to use not the correct pressure for your vehicle - one tyre can fit many different vehicles each with its own tyre pressure requirements. 

Over inflation of your tyres will cause them to wear out quicker, reduce braking efficiency, reduce road holding, and give a harsher ride. 

Tyre pressures for 185 R14 tyres on a type 2 are 30psi front and 35(empty) to 45(fully loaded)psi at the rear. If you have a camper it will never be empty (i.e. it will always have the camping equipment fitted) so 40psi at the back works well just upping to 45 for those fully loaded trips. 

Lots more on this in the library at that ever useful site www.type2.com 

good luck
