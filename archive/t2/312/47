Hello Chris    9 degreees is pretty cold.  I use to take the battery and oil 
out at night and put them behind the woodstove to keep them warm and 
reinstall them in the morning. worked great instant start ups. Sounds like 
your main bearings froze . If you need I have some good used type 1 engines 
Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
