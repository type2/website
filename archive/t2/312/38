Subject: WTB German hubcaps anyone???

Hello List,

I am looking for a set of 4 new German hubcaps or
perfect used ones. If they need cleaning, that is fine
but I don't want any with any rust, pitting, or dings.
Does ANYone still sell these??? I wish I had bought a
set of German one while I still had the chance. 

Thanks for any leads!

Have a great day!

David Kelly
