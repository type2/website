Yep. 'Tiss complete horse caca. Been running a head unit mounted CD player 
plus an aux. changer in my ' 78 for many years. No skipping, no problems. And 
keep in mind that my Westy is "baja'd" ie, lifted, big stiff tires, air 
shocks and gas/coil over on the front. Makes for a harsher ride, yet no 
complaints from the CD player. Passengers, well, thats another story....
