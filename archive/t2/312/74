Subject: Re: [T2] CHT readings

Does one really only need a quad CHT gauge?  Would not a dual be just a
good?  There are only 2 cylinder heads, made of high thermal conductivity
aluminum.  Would the temp very that much fore-to-aft?  But then, why are
quads sold?  In the future, (I really do not know when that is) I plan to
install the 3.125 quad gauge in the clock spot with 2 CHT sensors, and maybe
oil temp and oil pressure.  Or maybe oil temp and a tach.  Any possible
combo can be ordered apparently.
