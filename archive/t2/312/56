Subject: [T2] stereo...cd player

Hello everyone, I purchased a cd player stereo system for my bus, and
someone 
else told me they didn't think it would work good in it, that the bus
would 
be too bumby for the cd player, something about it mounting to the frame
in 
instalation....has anyone else put one in? I was wondering if this was
crap 
or not, lol...he also said he didn't know if there was enough juice for
the 
stereo amp and speakers. I'd appreciate any imput, hopefully she'll be
off 
the blocks and on the road soon, but I gotta have that sound too!!
Thank you,
