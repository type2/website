That really is a beautiful EV.  I've thought about converting a 914 which
around here are a dime a dozen.  I would have to use a gasoline heater which
would make it a year round car.  A bus would be a neat electric, but they
weigh much more and have less wind resistance.

I teach a technology program and one of my units is on alternative energy.
I have an electric mini bike which the kids get a big kick out of, but an
electric commuter vehicle would really get the point across.

I've seen a couple EV VW's at the RMMW show in Colorado, there is a local
highschool that is doing the work.
