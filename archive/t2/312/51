Subject: CHT readings

I have an idea.

I have a brand new VDO Cylinder Head Temp gauge that I am going to install in my
'79 Auto as soon as I can see the ground through all this white stuff....

Question: Can I get three more sensors, wire them to a 4-position switch, wire
that to the gauge and be able to toggle between the readings on all 4 cylinders?

I assume I can, but I would like to know if its possible and if anyone has done
it.
