Subject: Bottom sliding door bracket

Hello,
    I just broke the lower slideing door bracket on my 78 Westy. The one that
rides in the bottom track and holds the door up. If you have this part in any
workable condition new/used/reproduction. I would like to get one ASAP. If not
and you can point me in the direction of one it would be greatly appreciated.
Accidents happen
Thank you,
Greg Goforth
