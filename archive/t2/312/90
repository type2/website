Subject: tire pressure in '71

The sticker on my '71 Westy gives tire pressures for bias tires. Mine 
has radials. The sticker on my Ghia gives numbers for both bias and 
radials and these numbers are different. I assume that the same is 
true for the T2.

Can someone give me the correct numbers for radials on a '71 Westy?

thanks, jack
