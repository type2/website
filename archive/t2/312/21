Hi Dave,

Replacement speedo's are easily available from a local wrecker or swap 
meet.  It's not uncommon to  get an entire instrument cluster for $10 
or $15.

But if it must be repaired, a quick search of the archives uncovered 
this contact in a message from 09/2001:

Palo Alto Speedometer
718 Emerson St.
Palo Alto, CA 94301-2410
Tel: 650-323-0243
Fax: 650-323-4632
Web site: http://www.paspeedo_dot_com/

No word on how good they are, but their website is online.

Good luck!
