Subject: Re: [T2] stereo...cd player

i thought i was going to have problems with my cd player in my bus, but it 
has never skipped once, and it has been in 2 different buses.  i have a 
pioneer, which i swear by.  it cost me $170 and it is great.  to put it into 
perspective my  dad bought a $325 cd player and put it in a 1992 cadillac, 
skips over the smallest of bumps.  makes you think.
