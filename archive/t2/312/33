You can use the flat face of a large open end wrench to push the valve
spring down far enough to release the retainers. The head needs to be on the
floor so you can bring the pressure to bear by pushing down.

Replacement is trickier and requires an extra pair of hands, one to hold the
spring compressed, the other to put the retaining gizmos back in correctly.
Be careful, there is actually a top and bottom to these.  They can be
maneuver into position by the judicious use of a small screwdriver.
