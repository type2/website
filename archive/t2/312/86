Pictures would really help.  All of the FI hoses that I'm aware of are contained within the engine compartment. The brake booster hose, leaves the engine compartment from the left side of the air distribution box and goes through the firewall also on the left. It has a valve in it and I think a tee if you have an automatic.

Did the bus originally have an automatic transmission? Does it now?
