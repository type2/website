Well this turned out to be an interesting day at Discount Tire----

Last May I purchase all new Yokomama Super Van tires for the
Westy--because they were a good rated tire--heavy sidewall
construction--D rated and 8 ply rating---and it is an excellent highway
tire.

However, on the occasion when I have taken it for a winter " get the
fluids running blast---I have twice got snowed on--not by choice--by
chance.
And these tires are terrible in the snow.

I mean like ice skating--terrible traction--it is a test of dexterity to
just creep home and get the Van back into the garage to safety--

Well today it was pretty nice out----the roads were pretty dry this
afternoon and it was time for my free tire rotation and I wanted the
wheels balanced.

I told e sales person who sold me the tires how bad these things were in
the snow--and was looking to buy another type of all season hoop--and he
suggested in leu of this---try having the tires siped--like cut razor
wide grooves across the face of the tire---
He said this is the way to go for "just in  case" I get into some
unexpected bad weather--
It'll cause the tires to have more squeegees to ward of the slipping
phenomena in the slippery stuff----
And I figured for 10 bucks a tire what the hell---
I watched them do it--they offer it as a extra feature to any tire they
sell--new or not, and it is supposed to work excellent.

We'll see.
As I don't pan on driving the Westy in the garbage--if I do get caught
in it it may present a new feeling to the van.

I think this is the problem with most of the D rated stiff sidewall
truck tires these vehicles are recommended to be using--they are so
stiff they don't flex and offer any traction in foul weather conditions,
and I can see where this siping may help--

If I get caught in the white stuff ever again--I'll report on how this
works out---
It may be just another hype job---for nothing, but I'll try out anything
once---


Later,

Terry
