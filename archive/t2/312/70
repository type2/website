Actually...not too long after that photo was taken, the local VW dealership
set up a Eurovan and New Beetle RIGHT in front of us. So, apparently, they
are not only trying to squash sales of repro parts, but also ANYTHING
remotely German (such as the tasty Brats we had!). heheh...Their evil
intent was foiled as word spread and lines formed. Even our vegetarian
friends were enjoying the Smart Dogs we brought. They sold so well that
we'll have more at the next event!

Speaking of Bays and Vanagons and Euros, I'd be interested to hear what the
ratio of splits to non-splits was. Seemed a lot higher against splits this
year, but maybe that was just due to the new layout. Still, we were all
able to get along. As long as you remember that 68-71 buses are at least
good for parts! hahah just kidding of course.

Thanks to LBB for a great show at a great location. I hope the loser who
graffitied the bathroom didn't ruin it for us next year. Also, congrats to
all who attended for raising around $5,000 for the children's charity. Very
cool.
