Subject: Anti-seize

I've been reading in the archives about using not anti-seize on spark plug
threads.

My question is, if 3-in-1 oil is better to use because the anti-seize
hardens and requires chasing now and then, is the oil enough to prevent
corrosion?

I've been using oil but it seems when I take a plug out after a few thousand
miles the plug doesn't want to unscrew that easily.  I'm not fighting to get
it out but it seems it's was a lot easier to put it in because the oil has
long since drained away.
