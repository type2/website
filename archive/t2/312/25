<< Hey Terry...

Tire shredding has been around for MANY years...we used it in the 60s and 70s 
to
get our ice racing tires to "bite"....dirt trackers still do it 
today...truckers
do it too, but with larger grooves...they call it re-grooving...

Not an artform you'll likely see in a "new" tire store, but it sounds like you
may have lucked out...

Enjoy the ride...

I had the tyres (Avons;-), siped on my 650 Bonnevile...(not a Pontiac ;-)
