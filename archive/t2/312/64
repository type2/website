Courtney,

  You can also get it easily/cheaply in most home centers/Walmarts as swimming pool acid.  Has worked real well on the inside of motorcycle gas tanks.  I believe that POR15 also sells it in ready to spray form - Metal Ready.  And don't forget, it is reusable.  Just store the remainders/runoff in a sealed plastic container and you can use it over and over.
