Subject: (WTB) Torque converter Bolts?? Anyone???????

Hello List,

Well, my disorgization has caught up with me today.
When I removed my bus engine over a year ago, I put my
3 torque converter bolts somewhere where I knew where
they were at. (wordy) You guessed it. I hid them too
well. They are currently M.I.A. Does anyone have 3 of
these bolts that they could send me? 
I lined up my fly wheel with the torque converter
today, hoping to get the two bolted together but was
unable for obvious reasons.

If someone has a set, please let me know. I would
really like to get my engine wraped up and running
well before Everybus. :)

Thanks for your help and have a great day!
