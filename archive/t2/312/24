I would consider 15 mpg to be good for winter city driving.  My guess is
that the majority of the posts will agree to me.

Wait until summer and compare summer highway cruising mileage to the
summer mileage you remember getting.

I never saw better than 17 in my '77 (unless I drove less than say 60mph)
while on longer trips.  Do not fret.
