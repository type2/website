Subject: Type IV 2.0 L Connecting rod specifications

Hi All:

I am looking for specifications for connecting rods on a 2.0L type IV
aircooled engine. Wilson's book does not list any specifications for the
rods. Neither does Bentleys. Anyone have a link or information for the
following:

- Big End Diameter and clearance/wear limit,
- Gudgeon Pin (Piston pin) To Bush Clearance,
- Big End Float,


This is available for the type 1 (see http://www.aircooled.info/), but
so far I have had no luck finding it for the type IV's.

Thanks in advance for the help.

Regards,
