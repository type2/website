Sounds like it's rebuild time.  If you've been working on T1 engines, you'll
have no problem on the T4.  Take her out, strip her down and give her a good
rebuild.  If you do it right, and give her some TLC at regular intervals,
you shouldn't have any major problems with that 1700 for a long time.

The tin on the type 4 is really the only difference in taking the engine
apart.  Of course once you get into the long block, you'll soon see why the
type 4 last's so long, it is so much more "beefy".
