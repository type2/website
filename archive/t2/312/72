Yes and yes unless you use the correct thermocouple wire that the gauge is 
calibrated for.  If you delve around on the omega.com site, you will find 
connectors and thermocouple extension wire.  I used to use the stuff all 
the time for furnaces that I maintained.  Worked in two different 
facilities, heat treat place and a pottery/tile factory.  The pottery place 
had huge kilns that were on tracks and insides were  big enough to put a 
bus in and then have room to spare.  In the heat treat facility, I had to 
replace thermocouples on a somewhat regular basis.  2000F+ is hard on a lot 
of stuff.
