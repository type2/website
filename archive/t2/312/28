Subject: Re: [Syncro] POR15 Undercoat

Chris,

Let me make this point as clear as possible form a professional
standpoint---

To remove the factory finish--- even under the Van--Bus--- unless it is
damaged--heavily oxidised is suicide.

There is nothing that you can do to duplicate this finish as an
amateur---

Unless your prepared to open up all the metal your going to do and seal
it up immediately---with the same refinishing products as the factory
did---forget it.

And I'm talking about zinc chromate first--a self etching primer, then a
high loading sealer primer, then pant, then undercoating--just like the
factory did----

For some reason you have this premonition of trapping moisture in an
undercoating process that has no merit, rhyme or reason.

Now you are talking about opening up all the metal--and applying at best
a quick--hobbyist way of allegedly sealing off the open metal.

This POR stuff is not the correct way of doing what you want to do--and
no one I know in the auto body repair business ---or for that matter no
factory uses this stuff--anywhere.

It's Flim Flam---

I know you have a hermeticly sealed heat controlled, dehumidified,Binks
top of the line prep / spray booth in you garage---where any sort of
operation such as this should really be done to duplicate or better the
finish you now have on the bottom of your Van--- 

How old is this unit?

How log did the finish / undercoating last?

You will never get 1/10th of the time out of the stuff you want to be
applying to the bottom of your Van---no way--no how--

Your best bet --(again) is to clean the bottom with a hot water
3500---4000 psi pressure washer---let it dry---wipe the whole thing down
with a fast drying enamel reducer--and blow on Waxoyl, or a polyurethane
bed liner.

Oh--I forgot---

The polyisocyanates that the POR whatever will kill you---unless your
prepared to purchase a Binks--Sharpe asperated mask--paint suit, and
rubber gloves.

Have Fun---
