Subject: how do you repair speedo?

I disassembled my speedo to repair it. The odometer mechanism is OK and 
registers distance. There is a small spring behind the face plate that 
controls the needle. It is bent and won't allow the needle to return to 
zero MPH. Does anyone know how to repair this? Are parts available other 
than to buy another speedometer?
