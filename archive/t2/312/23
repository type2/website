Spark plug socket with extension.  No biggie.  If you need to, look down the hole first to see where you need to aim the socket.

Rare earth magnet on a stick.

That's marginal compression, but it should still start.

>Also, I found that place on one of the carbs where the idle shutoff solenoid screws in is stripped, causing the shut off not to tighten down.  Will this keep the engine from starting?

It could make it harder to start, but if the solenoid is physically in it's proper position it shouldn't make too much difference.  Wire or rubber band it in if you have to, for now.

Check valve lash before you jump to any conclusions about compression.
