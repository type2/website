Subject: Fuel milage going going gone.... Ideas?

Hello Friends,
I dont know if its the rising fuel costs, the cold
winter air being denser and harder to push through or
(and I'm trying to avoid this) something wrong with my
1978 fuel injected bus, but my milage seems to be
dropping. I remember getting around 20 miles while
cruising on highways and now even though I'm mostly
confined to the city, 15 mpg seems a little too kind
to the Kuwaities. Any thoughts or advice appreciated.
Aside from low compression what could be resposible
for the drop in economy?

Thanks,
Giles
