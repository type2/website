Subject: westy poptop bugscreen replacement

Hey everybody,both the zippers on my poptop are bad so my wife is going to replace them.While shes at it the bug screen isnt too good so she want to replace it too.The only problem we are having is sourcing quality bugscreen material.She found some at a big fabric store in springfield mo but Id like something that will last several years.Anyone know of a source.Not having to buy a huge quantity would be important also.Thanks
