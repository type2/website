 Do you think that the dizzy got wet and reduced the power?

David,

I'm going to agree with John here and say that 68 mph is a bit high for a
1970. It can be done, but its probably not advisable for long periods unless
you're running some gauges to give you a qualitative sense of how the bus is
doing.  This isn't to say you can't...I've done 65 for extended distances,
but that's with a non-stock cooling system, larger tires, and generally in
cold weather...with the aforementioned gauges to give me a qualitative sense
of whether things are going awry.

A poor man's compression test can be done by firing up the bus and removing
one spark plug wire from the distributor at a time (plugging it back in when
you're done) and listening to whether the tenor of the engine (or the rpm)
changes at all.  If the RPMs drop, then the cylinder was firing ok and is at
least working...
