Subject: quick disconnects for fuel

Would something like this work in a bus?

Would this just thread into the bottom of the tank?

 

I changed the tank connection on my '65 to an earlier model, so it has a
reserve switch function. Supposedly I can use this to shut off the fuel to
the engine, I have installed it, but not tried shutting the fuel off.

 

I think this is what I installed - (it was a while ago)
