Subject: 1970 camper - engine removal

The engine is out.  Ran into a few things during removal Id like to ask
about.

The drivers side upper engine mounting bolt was absent.  This would be the
one right behind the clutch lever.  That seems odd.  I suppose I need to
find new bolt (self locking same as the passenger side is?) and nut
somewhere.

I found the female end of a wiring harness near the transmission that isn't
connected to anything.  It appears to connect to a few male terminals on the
transmission itself.  The harness then travels to the engine compartment
where it becomes part of a spliced group going to coil.  Ideas of what this
would be?

Trying to get heat exchangers/muffler off is proving to be troublesome.  Few
studs have broken.  Patience with liquid wrench will hopefully make
remaining nuts easier to remove.  The entire muffler assy is pretty rusty.
 Replacing studs seems to be new on the to do list.  Wondering how to go
about that.

Onward,
