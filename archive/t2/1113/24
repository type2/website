David,

I'm going to agree with John here and say that 68 mph is a bit 
high for a 1970. It can be done, but its probably not advisable 
for long periods unless you're running some gauges to give you a 
qualitative sense of how the bus is doing.  This isn't to say
you can't...I've done 65 for extended distances, but that's with
a non-stock cooling system, larger tires, and generally in cold
weather...with the aforementioned gauges to give me a qualitative
sense of whether things are going awry.

A poor man's compression test can be done by firing up the bus and 
removing one spark plug wire from the distributor at a time 
(plugging it back in when you're done) and listening to whether
the tenor of the engine (or the rpm) changes at all.  If the RPMs
drop, then the cylinder was firing ok and is at least working...

Make sure to top up your oil and what-not before moving forward.

Good luck and keep us posted!

Cheers,
   Tom
