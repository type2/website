Subject: Re: Removing the closet on a 71 Westy

Yeah, as I recall it's an all or nothing job; everything has to come out.


------
I don't have a Westy Manual - trying to figure out if I can take out the
closet without taking the bench/bed out and top linen closet. Want to
replace the curtain on the window behind the sliding door.



Input would be appreciated.
