Subject: '80 Vanagon - still looking for a home!

First, I'd like to thank everyone who came by, the basement "parts room" is
well on its way to being empty!  YAY!  and I've only found that I can't prt
with about three small boxes of total garbage :-) But...  there's still a
couple of boxes of stuff that is going to go!  Y'all at Everybus (I'm
guessing at least one person has a web-enabled laptop via cell) please come
by on your way home and finish the job!

Of what remains, mostly, it's the Vanagon-related stuff, which brings us to
the subject of tonight's post.

I need to be rid of the '80 Vanagon!  It isn't the best of buses, I know,
but it has gotten me across the United States and back and was extrememly
comfortable while doing so!  It could very well be someone's dream bus with
a couple weekends of work (and (I think) less than $1K in parts).  It has
four very nice nearly new tires. It has a BA-6 heater! It has an unused  AVP
rebuilt engine hanging in it (none of the exhaust or FI is hooked up, but
the engine is hung).   Best of all, it has ultra-snazzy faux stained glass
windows!  I'd really like for it to go to to a good home, I'd hate to part
it, or have it go to a junk yard, but it does have to go!!!

Please, come by and have a look!  Get it out of my life!!!  Help me make a
parking spot for my '67!

Steve
