Subject: 1970 camper - engine removal - muffler & heat exchangers

Got the muffler and heat exchangers off.  Not so easy.

The heat exchangers are quite rusty as is the muffler.  I am considering
replacing them now while everything is out.  I was hoping I could ask for
supplier suggestions.  There seem to be so many different places offering
parts and parts made in various places.  As far as muffler I noticed this:

Also looking for best place to find heat exchangers.  Are exchangers made
anywhere designed to fit correctly or does experience show some are better
than others.  Any suggestions help.  Thanks!
