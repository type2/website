Subject: 1970 camper - power loss - smoke

Digging through archives, Bentley and Muir books...  Wanted to drop note of
initial issue - will report back after more work tomorrow.

Drove my newish to me 1970 camper for camping trip with my honey lat few
days (super time!)..  Driving back - 45 in - about 68mph I felt noticeable
loss of power and sudden white smoke out the rear.  Pulled over.  Turned out
my AAA benefits kicked in that day so towed her to my folks place.
 Timing...

Been about 800 miles since last tune up ((-at-) shop - delivered after receiving
the bus where it had previously sat for 6 years)...

Oil still appears at a good level - same as when I set off. No visible
leaks.  Today bought compression gauge, feeler gauge, plugs/points/dist
cap/condenser, oil screen, 3 Qts oil, valve cover gaskets, carb rebuild kit
etc (from wonderful old guy in NC mtns - cheap parts).  Reading all I can.

Boo.  Sad bus.  Will check compression and do my first valve adjustment in
morning.  See what I find after that and be back.  Oh to own a VW again....

Thought Id write,
