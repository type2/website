With the compression test results you posted I'd recommend that you just 
pull the engine and pull the head off on that side. At least it an older 
(Beetle) powered bus and thus MUCH easier to take apart. It'll be worth 
it. If the engine is still good you can take the opportunity to clean 
stuff, paint stuff if you want to, renew gaskets and seals.

Worry not - even if the piston is toast or the head is toast you might 
be able to swap only those parts and go many more miles.
