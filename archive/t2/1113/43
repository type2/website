I think Mike has the right idea. Since the noise stops when you lift
the manifold runner, I would guess the leak is most likely at the
lower side of the intake port (but this does not exclude a boot that
is not seated well too). Since you are using the hard plastic gasket,
I would pull the runner on that side and check for an easy slide fit
of the gasket onto the studs. Watch for bent engine tin preventing it
from seating well.

Also check the face of the manifold runner for straightness and the
head port surface for cleanliness. If necessary, use RTV to help take
up any slack that you cannot correct.
