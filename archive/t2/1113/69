Hi Courtney,

The zip ties are one of the keys. Makes it so much easier as the boot will
hold the joint together for you. In addition, get one or two  bolts of the
proper length and thread pattern to match the CV bolts, better if a tad
longer, and grind the heads down or if it is long enough, cut the head off. It
has to be long enough to thread in a bit, and go all the way through the
joint, to leave enough so you can get it out later. Put one inside the 'cave'
at the top hole, and then you can just hang the joint on it, while you put the
other screws in. If you have a second 'hanger bolt' , you can hang it from the
trans, and then get a bolt started on the inner portion and it will sit there
nicely while you struggle with getting the other bolts aligned.

Don't tighten any of the all the way, because you want to leave the zip ties
on until things are almost all in place, then snip them off.. Remove the one
bolt for the hanger, and put the last one in. Clip the ties, tighten them all
up, and you be done :-) It makes it so much easier if you use the "stud" bolt
to hang the joint on. Two is even better, but I got pretty good at it, and
only needed the one after a few times.

HTH,

  Geez, I've been cursing for 2 days now trying to put my axles back on my 77
  Westy alone. The joints are loose enough so that if I offer one end up to
the
  transaxle, the other end basically falls apart/disassembles itself and I do
a
  3 Stooges routine to try and juggle it all. I need about 5 more hands it
  seems!! What's the trick?
