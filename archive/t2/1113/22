I think Mike has you steered in the right direction. First thing I
would say is that 68 mph is a bit high for a 1970.

It's a bit speculative until we get your compression results. You
could be lucky and just happened to have splashed water as Mike
suggested, but it's a bit too coincidental coming with your power
loss.

You still might be lucky with some other explanation for the power loss

 - timing slipped due to loose distributor clamp or loose points

 - sudden clogging of the carb or fuel filter / fuel line / fuel tank
outlet, or even fuel pump dying

While the smoke looks suspiciously like a fatal error - failed valve
or cylinder - you still may avoid the silver bullet with something as
simple as a slipped or failed rocker arm.

Not much we can tell yet. Even a cold compression test can be useful
if it shows something obvious like 3 healthy cylinders and zero on the
other.

Keep us posted.
