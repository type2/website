Subject: Splittie question

Did split screen single cabs come in a bay windshield version, too?  Was
there a bay version full windshield single cab?

I'm working on obtaining materials for a casting project and have access to
both versions to work out prototypes.  If the bay version is a fluke, I
don't want to include it in the project.

I've got it in my head to produce futuristic versions of "hover" cars (not
sure if the method will be Hammer's Slammers type air turbine engines, or
thrusters) for war gaming terrain pieces.

It's always bothered me a bit that street fighting never seems to include
what you would normally find in the street, like cars, trucks, etc..  I've
got civilian, commercial & utility vehicles lining the shelves around my
desk.  The transit bus is the largest, and a rather small rather roundish
civilian car is the smallest.  With a number of futuristic models in
between.  I'd love to try conversions on a Messerschmitt KR200 and a BMW
Isetta 250 at some point, too.

I like the idea that somewhere in the far war-ravaged future, someone will
still be restoring antique vehicles...
