OMG, you think this is bad, never buy a vanagon where the outboard end is
buried in a 5" deep greasy spider filled hole with you working half blind. 
But then again I guess that at least supports the outboard end in a vanagon. 
Still I love the bus hub.  Anyway I bag my outboard one, regular ole plastic
shopping bag, pull tight down over the joint and boot then zip tie it tightly
around the shaft at the small end of the boot.  And I put all the bolts and
retainers in first, which even by itself usually hold things together.  Anyway
this keeps outboard end clean, attach inboard end completely, then snip the
zip tie rip off the garbage bag, lift the outboard end into position.  Of
course goes without saying jack the wheel so you can spin into alignment.
 Other alternatives, if the splines are loose too, can leave outboard off
(boot on) then slip it into postion and circlip, but that is a PITA in my
experience.  I do wonder a bit about the
 loosesness.  That sounds pretty darn loose, which leads to wondering about
wear.  Generally speaking with thick relatively cold grease, and the bolts
through the boot into the joint, a nice solid joint doesn't move around a
whole lot.  Might tip at the wrong moment, but not really fall back apart.

transaxle, the other end basically falls apart/disassembles itself and I do a
3 Stooges routine to try and juggle it all. I need about 5 more hands it
seems!! What's the trick?
