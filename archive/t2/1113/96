Subject: VW Bus sighting at BABY GAP stores

I was forced to go to a mall this weekend and walked past a BABY GAP store. 
They are using a almost true size VW Bus cut out as a promo window dressing.
Any one else spotted these in your area malls?

This will make a fine addition
to my collections of VW items in my garage/house when they get rid of those
cutouts.
 Happy Camping,
