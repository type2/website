Subject: Re: [T2] quick disconnects for fuel

Now what I was wondering was how would "you" plumb it?

I'm thinking mounting the valve to the frame rail and using very high 
quality rubber line to connect it to the tank. Crimped connections. A 
local FLAPS makes these hoses. Would also make crimped hoses for the 
rest of the connections.

The other option was to weld a mounting tab for each valve onto the 
bottom of the tank and attaching the valves directly to the tank and/pr 
directly to the fuel outlet. Would require an adapter be machined but 
that's no problem. Vibration leading to cracking of the tank might be a 
worry. Would want to see how much these valves bounce when they are 
actuated. Doubt the tank vibrates as much as exhaust or engine parts. My 
tank has been empty for about a decade and open as well so I bet it's 
safe to weld on... LOL! (seriously let's all be careful with this idea).

I'll be closing one of the outlets off for now since I'm going backwards 
to Corvair carb power versus EFI. (Still want to go Megasquirt later).

Ideas? Comments? Thanks!
