This likely has no relevance to this dialogue, but I can tell you  
first-hand that a blown piston will cause blue smoke to gush out the  
back and also splatter specks of oil all over the rear hatches and  
bumper.  This happened more than once to me due to an overheating No.  
3 cylinder (the classic weak spot in the air-cooled engine).  The  
pistons in each case had a small hole burned in the top surface,  
smaller than you might imagine. Thus the oil spewing out the exhaust  
valve and all over the back. At the other extreme, a spark-plug wire  
jiggling off the plug can just as readily reduce your bus to a  
gasping 3-cylinder cripple.
