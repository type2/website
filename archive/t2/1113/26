I just want to add:

On a hot summer day I drove my 76 for about 6 hours at 130KM/h -
140KM/h on the I81.  I suddenly lost power.  I went back to check and
found that a hole had melted through the head and burned the plug
wire.  I don't think this is your problem.  It sounds like a ring but
I just wanted share a lesson I learned the hard way. I ended up having
to replace the #3 head, jug and piston as the whole lot were melted.
