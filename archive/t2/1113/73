I was wondering about that too, since I have never had the balls fall out 
that I can remember.   remember taking a CV joint apart that had failed 
just to see what the problem was and remembering how far I had to twist it 
to get the balls out....

if it were my bus, I would buy 4 new CV joints they are not that expensive 
and sure saves a messy repair or worse on the side of the road.

YMMV
good luck
