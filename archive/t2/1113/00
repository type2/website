As far as I can tell, it's just protection for the edge of the fiberglass,
and maybe keeps the fiberglass from digging into the paint of the rain
gutters - as opposed to the Westy trim which I believe actually has some
sealing function. The original plastic trim on my Rivi didn't appear to seal
in any way, and no rain seeped in where it was missing. Reasonably certain
(altho I can't find the invoice, having just moved) I ordered it from here
after getting a sample: http://www.trimlok.com/regular_trim.aspx

Campingworld.com used to carry some some in white and black, but it if I
recall correctly, it was pricey for custom lengths.
