Subject: Re: [T2] What is your diagnosis?

Hmmm...  I'll put my money on a disintegrating clutch disk.  Throwout
bearing and pilot bearing would make noises when the clutch pedal was down
and be silent when the pedal was up.  If the disc is disintegrating,
however, you'll get noise when the pedal is up and, because your clutch is
never fully disengaged, will have trouble shifting.  Another (long shot)
possible cause (ask Troy Wical) is the front mount on the trans coming
loose.
