Subject: 1970 camper - power loss - smoke

Thanks for your comments thus far.  To elaborate, the smoke coming out the
back lasted for more than a few seconds.  Didn't appear as a quick result of
water or other temporary burn off hot engine.  I couldn't see very well the
color but following behind me my girlfriend saw it as rather white.  Not a
small amount either.  Did not smell like oil...  After having bus towed I
started it briefly and it ran quite rough.  Would take verve on the
accelerator to maintain idle.

My report back is with incomplete data but Im in need of some hand holding.
 Removed the plugs - 2,3 & 4 are a lovely tan.  Look as though they should.
 1 is more black and wet.  My guess would be gas?  I did compression (cold)
test and yielded the following:

Just to make sure Im accurate when at rear the cylenders are:

3  1
4  2

yes?

4  - 135 psi
3 - 92 psi
2 - 100 psi
1 - 0 psi

However the treaded end of comp tester seemed to tighten quickly when
screwing into 1.  I turned key for few revolutions and got 0 psi.  Went back
and worked to tighten making sure tester end was tight and there were no
leaks from plug hole.  Tried again zero.  Removed tester and screwed in new
plug to make sure engine threads are clean and it tightens quickly.  Im
afraid to torque it much fearing the initial threads may lead to cross
threading.  Boo.  1 is more of a pain to get to.  Anything I should do to
make sure threads are clean?  Should I get a tap and try to regroove?

Newbie here, but reasonably certain Id like to refrain from screwing the
threads up....  I'll take a suggestion.  Bless you,
