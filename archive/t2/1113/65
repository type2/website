Is 1970 a dog house cooler year? If so, you should have the nut
embedded in the engine case. Otherwise, a standard nut and bolt are in
order. The driver side does not use a locking bolt, whether or not it
screws into the case.

It depends on how much stud is left. If you can get a vise grip on it,
you're in luck. If it is flush with the head, you have to drill and
use an EZ-Out. This can be difficult to do without messing up the
head. You might prefer to take the head to a machine shop and let them
replace it for you.
