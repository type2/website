Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of CV joints, how do you get them back on??

Thanks John; I didn't have all the bolts through the boots which are new, and
I guess this allowed it to flop around quite well. I will put all the bolts
through as suggested by yourself and others and that should tighten things up.
The CV's themselves all look very good with no galling or obvious wear. They
are all genuine Lobros so I know it's good stuff. :-) Thanks to all for the
help!
Courtney
