If the valve was stuck open, you would have a loose rocker arm. Your
feeler gauge says the valve is tight, not loose.

Pointing the rotor to the mark on the distributor may not be accurate
enough. Be sure you are pointed at TDC on the pully.

If there is still no valve stem to rocker arm gap, this would be
caused by overheating the valve and the stem stretching. Some of this
occurs naturally, which is why we adjust valves so frequently.

If you are lucky, you have only overheated and stretched the valves
enough to prevent it from seating. An abused valve is more likely to
snap in the future though. To check this possibility, adjust the
valves and take a new compression test.

You have correctly identified your valves on # 1.
