Conclusive comp test
1 - 0psi
2 - 100psi
3 - 90 psi
4 - 135 psi

Likely indicates valve stuck open?

I have valve cover  (1 & 2) off. Front-most valve would be cyl 1 exhaust,
next valve toward rear is cyl 1 intake, yes?   What should I look for?  When
I turn gen I see movement of all rods, rocker arms and valve springs - not
sure what to observe.

I put rotor to file mark on distributor and crankshaft notch is at 12:00 and
(caveat never done valve job) I can't squeeze .006 feeler into  front 2
rocker arm/valve gaps.  I will go meditate on it....  I do appreciate at
least learning what is wrong even if I decide outsource repair at this
point.  Thanks for your time folks.

Bummed,
