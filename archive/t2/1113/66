Subject: Speaking of CV joints, how do you get them back on??

Geez, I've been cursing for 2 days now trying to put my axles back on my 77
Westy alone. The joints are loose enough so that if I offer one end up to the
transaxle, the other end basically falls apart/disassembles itself and I do a
3 Stooges routine to try and juggle it all. I need about 5 more hands it
seems!! What's the trick?
