Subject: re:'68 van (removing dash panel)

When taking my dash panel out, I just slide the heat lever handles off, then
unscrew the dash pad. Only 4 screws I think. The handle levers on my '69
slide off pretty easily. I'm not sure if it is different in a '68.

 

One suggestion-please make your post subject more relevant to your question,
it makes searching the archives much easier.

 

Good luck.
