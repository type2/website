Very good points. Some of those valves were rated as using alot of juice 
but others not as much. Something to be wary of.

Might lead to more work like having the fuel circulate in a loop even on 
a carb vehicle like mine  but that leads to fuel pressure regulators and 
so forth.

Still going to pursue this. My schedule says I'll be able to work on the 
bus in August... GRIN!
