Subject: [T2] What is your diagnosis?

1969 Bus.

Reason: Teddy and I were on the road to Everybus and we said the bus
is running better than ever. Forgot to knock on wood.

Symptom: After a short stop, made a huge grinding noise that stopped
when the clutch depressed about half petal. Would not shift. Turned
engine off, put in first gear, started engine, and limped about 1 mile
to a safe parking area. Sounded horrible when clutch released all the
way. This afternoon I was able to drive it to the towing lot about one
half block away. Clutch half petal worked that short trip, no need for
shifting when moving. Shifted into reverse for the required 15 feet to
the holding area. Noise only when petal all the way up

Diagnosis: Pending getting the bus home and pulling the engine. Might
get it back tomorrow.

What is your best guess?? B Ill report the answer when the engine is out.
