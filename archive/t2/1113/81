Subject: Another parts post...

OK, so Wayne (arcadeforever) stopped by on Friday on his way to everybus.  I
pressed him to take a couple parts he really didn't want on the basis that
someone at everybus would want them.  Among those parts was a pair of '78
heater flap valves, you know... the ones with the hose coming off the valve
to vent waste heat away from the bus?

IF Wayne gave them away, and IF you got them, I need to get in touch!  When
I gave them to him, I did not have the other end, the tubes that attach to
the frame.  I just found those tubes today and would like to reunite them
with the flap valves.  OTOH, Wayne, if you decided to keep them, please stop
by on your way back and pick up the tubes, while they are not vital to the
function of the valves,  they are nice to have and complete the set.  Third,
option, if no one wanted them and you don't either, please drop by and drop
them off... now that I think I am keeping the '73, they would be a lovely
addition to that bus.

OK Is everyone confused now? :-)  As you were!

I still have quite a bit in the basement, btw, and would welcome visits by
anyone coming back via I-95 past Alexandria!  I'll be "at home" all
afternoon (after 2PM), so stop by
