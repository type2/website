Subject: FI harness

Hello list,
 I may be needing an FI harness, this is for a 78 non California model.
After doing some work to the FI system, mysteriously 1-2 cylinders are not
firing..so I want to throw it out there now.
Anyone know of new or rebuilt harness's or a rebuilder?
General costs for such an item?? humbly yours Joe
