I too have a 68 westy.  And unless someone has done this already, it can be
a bear.  There are plastic clips holding the handles on there.  Many suggest
leaving the plastic clips out when you put it all back together.  There are
also metal clips as well.  But those plastic ones are the tough ones.  I had
to pull my radio out to get decent access to mine.  If you can pull the top
of the dash off I suppose that would help as well.

Good luck.

Advice needed: I have a 1968 VW Westfalia. I want to remove  the instrument 
panel to replace light bulbs. How do I remove the panel without  needing to 
take the 4 air/heat levers apart ? Looks like there should be an  easier 
way.
Appreciate any guidance.
