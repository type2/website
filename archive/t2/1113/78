update:

thanks again for all your assistance.

When my bus broke I had her towed to my folks place in Liberty NC (I live in
Boone, 2 hours away).  Did I mention AAA benefits kicked in that very day...


As it happens Everybus gathering is this weekend 15 minutes from my folks.
 This evening I went to the gathering and met some fine folks.  I found a
rebuilt engine from people I trust for $400 and will put that in the bus
tomorrow.

Thats the plan.  So I have this old engine here...  What to do with
that?....

Just thought Id share my progress.  Thanks again for the time those with
much more experience so willingly share.  It is appreciated,
