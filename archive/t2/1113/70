Of course as compression and rebuild are likely heading his way anyway here, I
wouldn't lose too much sleep over the exhaust studs yet.  Chances are heads
are going to be in order, and if you watch samba and *bay carefully you are
going to find a rebuilt head for about twice the cost of an hour in a machine
shop at todays rates that they are going to get you just to remove a stud or
two.  A real stud remover can help a bit BTW, get at least a K-D brand or
something similar.

It depends on how much stud is left. If you can get a vise grip on it,
you're in luck. If it is flush with the head, you have to drill and
use an EZ-Out. This can be difficult to do without messing up the
head. You might prefer to take the head to a machine shop and let them
replace it for you.
