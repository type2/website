My '78 VW Westy 2.0L did this once. Got on the highway headed out at a 
fast pace and a few miles down the road I got a cloud of smoke out back. 
Pulled over, checked it all and headed out again. No problems, no real 
loss of oil, but the smoke was white and it was oil. I think I had the 
crankcase over filled a little and once the oil got really whipped up by 
the crankshaft a big gulp got sucked into the PCV valve (crankcase vent) 
and burned. It did not run well during this period b/c the fuel/air 
mixture was all wrong. Perhaps you have a fouled spark plug now. Pull 
'em and clean them.

68 mph is pretty fast for one of these old beauties. They were sold 
during the 55 mph speed limit era. I'd consider staying closer to 55 mph 
than 70 mph. I aim for 60 mph in my aircooled VWs. It's part of the 
reason that I'm aiming for Corvair power. I don't so much want a higher 
top speed as much as I don't want to give up so much momentum on the 
hills. Don't want to get run over... LOL! (Am saving all the VW bits in 
case I want to go back, bus is uncut).

Do a full tune up inspection. Do a compression test. If you can do a 
leakdown test (information is more valuable).

Good luck. Let us know what you find out.
