Yeah, that's it. Cylinder 1 is dead. Not being able to thread the
tester all the way into the plug hole is not enough to yield a zero
reading.

Plug is wet because of oil. Gas will evaporate right away. Also the
smell is different.

Running rough because running on 3 cylinders.

Will have to pull engine to continue diagnosis. Well, might pull valve
cover first to see what you can see from there.
