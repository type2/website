I did this a couple years ago for the exact same reason.  IIRC, the top
tray has to come out and the bed doesn't need to come out - but you do
need to unbolt a few things on the closet side (front panel of the bed
along the floor and I think maybe one bolt on the bed itself).  Since I
don't have my Westy handy at the moment, I can't go out and take a
look...  It wasn't too bad, actually.

I don't have a Westy Manual - trying to figure out if I can take out the
closet without taking the bench/bed out and top linen closet. Want to
replace the curtain on the window behind the sliding door.
