Those valves look good from the standpoint that they are rated for 
automotive and fuel. However at 8 watts, thats a lot of heat going into your 
fuel. Could contribute to vapor lock on a hot day. I do like the idea of the 
fuel shut off when the ignition is off.

know which one. Save me some pondering... GRIN!
