Sounds like you have a vacuum leak somewhere.  Try some carb cleaner or 
starter fluid and just spray a short burst around the area of the noise 
and see if the RPMs increase.  If the RPM changes, you found your leak.

You can also do this with propane as well.  As with anything that's 
highly flammable, make sure you're doing this in a very well ventilated 
area with all of the hatches open.  If you do short bursts of the 
cleaner or whatever flammable gas you use, you most likely won't blow 
yourself up - but be careful regardless :)
