Late response due to wanting to get my bus back up to check my gauge
operation. I think pegged at the high end means a direct short in the
sender. Normally the gauge reads low, and as the sender gets hotter,
it reduces the internal resistance to allow more gauge needle
movement. So completely pegged means something happened and there is
zero resistance in the sender (or the wire is grounded somewhere along
the way.)

 that it is pegged at the high off the scale end even parked for hours,
 everything off key in my pocket. Mostly real good, just the gauge
 baffles me. But its just a gauge...
