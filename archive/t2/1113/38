I should add to look at the threads on that number 1 plug to see if
any of the head aluminum has stuck in the threads.

If so, that could explain the threading problem. You can clean the
plug threads. Aluminum is soft enough to pick out with a knife tip. If
it is too stubborn, you will have to use a die to clean the threads.

Once it is clean, you can try to see if you can gently re-install the
plug to restore the head threads.
