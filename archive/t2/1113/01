It's just protection for the edge of the fiberglass.  I buy it locally  
from Bulldog Enterprises in La Grande, OR.  They've changed hands in  
the past month or so and the recession really did a number on the  
local RV manufacturers so they may no longer stock it.  It was about  
$1.50/ft. IIRC.

Check your local RV parts place.  Camping world probably won't have  
it, but Joe's RV Repair probably will.
