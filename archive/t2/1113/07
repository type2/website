 I bought an alternator harness from Kyle last year. It came with the rubber
grommet and an extra wire to be used in the future. It was a thing of
beauty. It installed in minutes.

The above referenced shop can make you a new harness.  From what I've read
people have been nothing but pleased with the harnesses from Kyle.  You do
have to send in your old harness or pay a core charge.
