Subject: RE: [T2] Removing the closet on a 71 Westy

I did this several months ago to put in a hardwood floor.

Everything must come out - icebox, bed, headbanger cabinet.

While everything is out, you can clean up all the crap that's fallen  
through the cracks and spot-treat any rust that may be present.
