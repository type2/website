It's may not be directly related, but Jeff Bowlsby did a phenomenal amount
of research on the early Bosch D-jet and L-jet fuel injection system about
10 years ago.  I first ran into him when I lost an e!ay bid for an original
Bosch d-jet fuel injection testing unit.  A few years later he contacted me
and said he'd finished with it and sold it to me for less than either of us
bid for it (a sum that was quite a bit more than a few buses I've bought and
driven in years past I might add).  Anyway, I can vouch for this man's
impeccable attention to detail and perfection.  If the 914 L-jet system is
the same as the bus L-jet system then this is the thing that dreams are made
of.  I bought a D-jet harness from him about 7 years ago for my 74 914 2.0
and it is truly a work of art.  Every connector, every connection, and every
length of wire was exactly as it should be and my 914 has been running
flawlessly ever since the upgrade.  Looking at the various suspension, tire,
stereo, body-fitting, etc. upgrades I've done over the past 19 year this was
one of the true "no brainers" and my only regret was that such a thing
wasn't available 10 year earlier!
