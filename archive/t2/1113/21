The first thing I'd try is the compression test.  If it didn't make any 
funny noises, I'd probably try running the engine briefly (20 or so 
seconds) and then do your compression test.  If you do it on a cold 
engine, that will skew your results and you might think the wrong 
cylinder is bad (if any are bad).  Take note of any discolored plugs and 
what cylinder it came from.

Before you change any of the valve settings, do a reading on them before 
you loosen them and write everything down (which were tight, which were 
loose).  You should do this *every* time you check your valves so that 
you have a history of any valve movement over time.

Ultimately, my guess is oil got into one of the cylinders - granted, you 
said white smoke, which means coolant - but you don't have coolant.  So 
you either drove through a puddle, or it was actually a blueish smoke, 
which would be burning oil - but I'm sure they all look pretty similar...

Anyways, let us know what you find.
