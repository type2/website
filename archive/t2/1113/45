Subject: F/S  78 transporter Orginal paint 37k miles

A customer has a 78 transporter in great shape for a 35 yr old bus that
seems all original. the battery tray looks great the paint only has a
few bad spots and maybe a few small dings in the body. Headliner looks
new the white seats are clean,

Now the bad it needs engine work because it sat so long  the engine was
taken apart and  P&C's are missing, the heads have qestionable  plug
holes, other then that block looks good and even the stock muffer is
very useable.

He said he would take $2000  Pictures if interested

this is one of the cleanest unrestored buses I've seen
