Subject: Sink Pump

I started to add this to my second battery and accessory post but decided it may need its own identity.

I think my sink works with the key off sometimes and other times I have to turn the key to the run position to get the sink to work, am I crazy, is this really happening?

How is it supposed to work?  It seems that having the key off would be the best way.

Is it broken, suggestions on fixing it?
