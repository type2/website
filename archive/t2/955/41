Subject: "the hubcap"...

Hi all,

Since we're collecting opinions, I believe the only "hubcap" is the original
one with it's carrying case/trunk and donated articles.  I think every effort
should be made to trace it to the last person transporting it (sounds like
someone did locate the current holder of the cap), and lighting a fire under
their ass to get it mobile again.  Also, I personally believe that any VW
Transporter, Splitty through Eurovan qualifies to haul it, but ONLY a VW
Transporter should haul the "hubcap".

If it comes to an event near you, be sure to check out all of the signitures,
momentos, stickers and the logbook that travels with the "hubcap"  The
original idea is a cool one, but let's keep doing this with the original
'hubcap"!
