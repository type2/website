Hi Volks,


I HAVE LOCATED THE HUBCAP!!!   There is no need for a replacement.

It's in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and I have the email address of its  
current custodian.  So... where does it go from there???

I'd suggest we let Troy pick it up; bring it to EveryBus for Mark to  
drool on and then take it west again to give to Don.

But that decision is not up to me; ultimately it is up to the Hubcap.  
The guy who has it now is Greg Mogle, he can be reached at  
watchbus_AT_swcp.com



Happy Trails,

......What if we start a second hubcap around the country this
year.  I'd love to be involved in it, since this is the first
year I'll have my Bus out.  I'd start it off and either paint
one, start a stock one (think my chrome ones are
aftermarket) or what ever,
