Greg said..."The Hubcap has been to Canada twice I think. I had it back in
2001, before "Bob the Tomato" was a red pop-top. Jamie Rivers had it about a
year before that."

And I know it has made it's way up and down the east coast as well as from
the east coast to mid America a couple of times.  My vote would be to send
it West to that coast next.
