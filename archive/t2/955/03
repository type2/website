you should set it so that the nose of the tranny would be at about the
same angle as it would be if a shifter linkage came out the front of the
tranny and had to line up with the gearshift lever

it is normal for a half inch or so but not much, the front tranny mount on
an auto tranny is a flat piece of metal that slides into a rubber lined
box and it is pretty close fit, no space to speak of. not glove tight but
no slop either
