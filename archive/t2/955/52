If your not worried about the slight bend... then you can cut a slot on the 
side of the frame to access the loose nut,, and remove the bolt. when you 
put it back together,, use a nut welded to a tab.. or a piece of flat bar 
that is threaded so you can leave it sticking out the slot... you can put a 
tack weld on that tab to hold it in place and weld the slot up again if you 
choose. 

Hope that works..
