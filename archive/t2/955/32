If the decision is made to do this, I'd be happy to donate another one to
the cause (I donated the original one). It would be an aftermarket one,
although as I recall so is the existing one. I don't remember if the
existing one is the pre-1971 domed version or the post-1971 flat version,
but whichever it is, I'd suggest using the other version for the second one,
to easily distinguish them, and so that we cover all years.
