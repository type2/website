Just saw a COPS episode where they come upon a roaring fire at a house.  They found out that a guy was working on a van that caught on fire and then caught the house on fire.  They talked to the guy, who was almost suicidal at burning his best friends house to the ground.  He said he knew he had a gas leak and something about gas had gotten into or around the cylinders.  He pulled a couple of plugs and turned the engine over to get the gas out.  Yep - he forgot to unplug the coil.  I kept looking to see what kind of van it was.   Finally got a glimpse of the shell.  You guessed it - a Bay.  The house was a total loss.  

I don't know where it was filmed.  They've done several of them here in Chattanooga but I don't think we've had any busses burned around here lately.  

Note to the not-so-gullible:  this is not a Friday post.  This one's for real!  It's been a few years since I changed my hoses.  I think I'm going to get on it.  Cheers....KR
