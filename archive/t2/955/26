Doesn't  the hubcap had to be carried in a Bus??? I think the list  
should  weigh in on this one.



Hey Greg  I agree with don a bus is a bus including  vanagons.   I personally 
would love to carry the hubca-p at least once  in my lifetime. some how it 
passed right by me ?? Only time I ever saw it was at  everybus the year Kelly 
Brown was carrying it. I do remember that it had a Va.  Tech sticker on it so it 
was at one time only 40 miles from me.   later  Mark Dearing
