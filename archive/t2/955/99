HAHAHAHAHAH... don't worry.... it's not *that* good - you'll still hear 
your engine ;)

and mind you, I probably have a pretty quiet engine compared to most 
because mine's completely balanced, and it is still audible..

Granted.. I can't hear it cuz I blast my stereo way to loud... speaking 
of which, whenever I don't have my radio playing, I always think 
something is breaking because I can hear every minute noise.. drives me 
bonkers.
