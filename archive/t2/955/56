Thank you very much for your reply, I have been told to use gravity for my battery clamp by the guys at Traftons in east Portland also.

the thing is I don't want everything hot all the time, how can I make the fuse panel hot with a second switch?

Story that may be funny to the electrically educated - I ran a wire from the constant hot wire on my radio through a regular toggle switch and into the ignition hot wire thinking that I could flip the switch and power the ignition hot side without the key on, well it powered up everything on my dash just as if I had turned the key to the run position FLOWING THE ELECTRICITY BACKWARDS through the fuse panel which is really frustrating because I don't know how many times I have been told to think of electricity like water and my wires like plumbing, well water only flows one direction in my house.

Apparently you can buy a toggle switch that won't do this, I am going to have to track down the guy that told me this and get him to draw me a picture.
