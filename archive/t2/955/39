Subject: Hubcap pic sent to Ron Salmon and Rich. Atwell

Here is a pic (removed for list mailing)(for Ron and R Atwell) showing 
hubcap at turn of 2000 to
2001-I think I got it from ? and gave it to Andy in Delaware.
It was a baby moon hubcap.  If you want a guaranteed 250K late
model hubcap, I can provide it!  Minor dents included. The makeup kit
bag pictured I gave for it and people put in mementos of thir own..
It should be a provision that if it is handed over the event would be
postcarded ant sent to a registrar, such as Ron Salmon or Richard
Atwell- then we know who to dun if it becomes missing .>
