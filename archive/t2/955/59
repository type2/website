Subject: Power Converter

I am contemplating updating/modernizing my power/charging system in my westy.

For that, I need to know how many amps I could possibly need.  I know the
stock one is 15 amps and is adequate for the fridge and stock stuff.  I am
adding a smallish RV furnace that pulls I think 6 more amps.  Would a 20
amp converter be adequate?  Or, should I go for 30?

Thanks for the help,

Mark
