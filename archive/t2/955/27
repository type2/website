Subject: Hubcap Idea

I posted this in a reply to another thread, but wanted to run it by the list.

What if we start a second hubcap around the country this year.  I'd love to be
involved in it, since this is the first year I'll have my Bus out.  I'd start
it off and either paint one, start a stock one (think my chrome ones are
aftermarket) or what ever,

What's everyone think?
