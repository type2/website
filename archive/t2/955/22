	Upper cylinder lubrication at cold startup.

	Far be it from me to dispute the diagnosis of a Canuck who 
knows about Meteors.

	And how long do you ask the cylinders/rings/pistons to last 
before rebuild of these racing motors?

	I've been assuming that's what it is.

	Nobody is saying a quart per 300 mi is OK.  The question 
related only to a puff of blue at cold start.  I still say that if 
that's all Nat has wrong, he shouldn't worry.
