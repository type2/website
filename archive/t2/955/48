Subject: Electrical Questions - 2nd battery - Accessory

I have a couple questions regarding my 1978 Westy, it is important to note that I am not very smart about electricity.

I am adding a second battery on the drivers side of the engine, opposite the stock battery location, and I will be using the wiring kit from German Supply, I will be attaching an amplifier directly off the second battery.

Question 1 - How do I clamp this additional battery down?  How have others done it?

My 1978, to the best of my knowledge, does not have an accessory position for the key, in order to have my radio on I must turn the key to the run position.

I would like to have my radio on when camping and plan to add an inverter in the future that can also be used when the key is off, I want to run everything off only the second battery when parked with the engine off (and add a solar charger eventually).

I have no issue with adding a switch to change over to accessory only when camped if this is the best solution.

Question 2 - How do I wire my bus so I can run my radio and other powerered accessories without having the key in the run position?  I need really small words for this answer, I am not an electrician for sure.

Thank you very much, everything is appreciated,

I would be excited to have somebody in my neighborhood show me if they were interested, compensation with beer or coffee
