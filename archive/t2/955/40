Subject: Repair shop on the way to Flodida

HI,

We are a retired couple and In a few weeks we will be travelling from Quebec
Canada to Tampa Florida in a 1975 westy . I was wondering if any one on the
list could refer me to some honest and competent repair shops along the way. I
already know about the air list and I carry it with me at all time ( I am also
on the air list) but my experience wit it was very frustrating du to the
amount of wrong phone number on it.

We will be Taking I 87 from the Canadian border to Albany NY, I 88 to
Binghamton NY., I 81 to Pulaski Virginia, I 77 to Colombia Virginia, I 26 to I
95 all the way to Florida where we will be meeting with some friends that are
very familiar with the rest of our trip.

I thank you in advance and you can send the information directly to me if you
would rather.
