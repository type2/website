There is no choke. The cold start mechanism is the
thermo-time switch, air bypass valve (to increase
rpm's) and the cold start injector (for enrichening)

They are naturally aspirated - no supercharger or
turbocharger and thus rely on atmospheric pressure. So
the intake is charged only with atmospheric pressure.
