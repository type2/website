I got some inspiration last night, tiredly looking at the crossbar I spent
a few days welding, bending, cutting..  The four locations on the bottom
of the EA81 are about 10 or so inches apart in width (head to head)
The 73 "moustache" bar is about 14" in width, measured at a height
of 2" (the thickness of my rubber motor mounts) ...  so it might just
work... I don't know about spacing front/rear, IE will the moustache
bar hit the pulley, or the oil filter...

I'll find out today and post some pictures.
