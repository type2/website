I put sound deadening material all throughout the back of the bus and it 
made a huge difference.  I actually pulled out all the interior and put 
it on the engine deck, underneath the back seats, along the walls, on 
the floor, everywhere.  Makes a big difference.  I haven't done the 
front yet, but I will soon.
