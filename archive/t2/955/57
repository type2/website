One way to do this is disconnect the main battery lead to the fuses that  
power your
accessories and connect a lead from auxillary battery instead.

For the radio, I connected two lines from the auxillary battery.  One has  
a manual
on and off switch so the radio can be turned on when parked or camping.   
The other goes
through a 12-volt electrical relay switch that is turned on by power from  
the ignition
switch when the bus is turned on, so the radio automatically powers up  
just by turning
the switch.
