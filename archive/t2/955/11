	Right on Mike.
	A brief burst of blue smoke upon startup is usually nothing 
to worry about.  Motors with 'racing' clearances often do this; it 
implies upper-cylinder lubricant from the cold start, which is good 
(so long as it isn't so 'generous' as to foul the plugs).  My Renault 
10 would always do this when in top condition (80 mph top speed; 53 
mpg (-at-) 55 mph).
	White fog from water-vapour condensing is even less to worry about.
	Get to grips with the substances themselves, Nat.  Hold your 
hand near the tailpipe while this matter is being emitted, and then 
examine the hand for evidence of oil vs. water.
