Hi Jim,

I agree that it needs to go west. The problem is that no-one can  
effectively manage the "herd-of-cats" that surround the hubcap. There  
is far too much chaos involved, and no way to make everyone happy.  
Everyone who tries to do it winds up offending *someone*, and hurting  
feelings.

If you want to step up as 2007 Hubcap Tour Co-ordinator, the job is  
available.

I managed to find it and get it moving again.  My work here is done.


Happy Trails,
