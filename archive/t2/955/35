And to just throw in my own two cents, I think it should be an OEM used one.
Off of a bus. One that's been spinning along highways for 3 or four decades,
and shows it with dings and rust pits. Preferably yanked off of a bus
languishing unloved in a junkyard. No one will jack it then, and there is
something uber cool about holding an original piece that has more miles than
you do. You get to dream about where it has been, and hold a piece of
history. Besides, it has a little more ilan than one made in China by some
slave for 25 cents. Or one made in Germany by a robot.
