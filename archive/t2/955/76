I am amazed and fulfilled when I read the Diversity of the list...and I
wonder...if we are of the "short wick", ie, material to work with, on an
individual basis, what will be next, as in "repro", and "rebuild", and then I
see "Subies", etc , and I think that "Buses", for whatever purpose, will
exist, no matter the reason, some mobile, some "cemented", but there will
always be a "few", who remember, and appreciate, what they were for "them",
and what they have now, and then, I remember, how great "groups" are!  I am on
my way to a funeral for a dear friend,  and thought I would emote, before I
go.  I profusly appologize for my rant!
