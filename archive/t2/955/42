Here's a couple of VW shops for the Albany area:

Hackel's VW
1374 Central Ave
Albany, 	New York
Phone: 518.458.2897

Will Work On: AC & WC

Hackel's pretty much out of the aircooled game now but he might have
engine parts if you need them in a pinch (he helped me out with some
cylinder head studs in the past). Last time I was there he had some
very beautiful looking rebuilt type-1 engines on display.

Terry LaCasse VW
902 Central Nassau Rd., Hoags Corners
East Nassau, 	New York 12062
Phone: 518.766.5654

Will Work On: VWs
Rt 66. -  Troy off Rt 20 in Nassau.   Left (-at-) Hoags Corners Inn.

Everyone around Albany that owns a bus knows Terry because he's the #1
guy to go to. A little out of your way (about 30 minutes East of
Albany). He's got a few parts buses sitting around (currently buried
under about 2 feet of snow)


Hope that helps

BTW: There are lots of hills on I-81.
