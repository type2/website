Subject: Sound deadening...

Hey guys!

      First off, just wanted to say thanks to everyone who gave me advice on swapping out my lifters. I really appreciate it! I've been letting them soak now for over a week, but I intend on trying to bleed them before I install them for good.

      Anyway, I had a quick question about sound deadening. I'm completely restoring a Porsche 944 that I bought really cheap. I've been using dynamat in many hidden places, trying to give the car a more refined interior sound. And... it got me thinking. The Bus motor I have is quite loud. It's significantly improved since I installed the factory muffler I bought from Bus Depot. But... I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, is it worth it to install sound deadening materials in the Bus? I mean, I don't expect it to be quiet like a Mercedes or a Lincoln interior, but, with the power of the Bus being what it is... what would 60 pounds of dynamat and jute backing do for it? And also, I'd really like to hear from anyone else who's attempted to make their Bus's interior more quiet. For what it's worth, my goal has been to restore my VW Bus so that it looks OEM. I'm almost done, just need a new headliner and need to finish my under dash wiring.

And my other question is, does anyone know where I can JUST buy pieces of jute? Like maybe a 4'x6' piece or something?


Thanks!!!

Todd
