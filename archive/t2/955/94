Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...

I am very interested in making sound deadening improvements, you can't talk to anybody in the back seat.

When I bought my Westy there wasn't a headliner, I used imitation Dynamat I got for free at work and double-back-carpet taped foil covered bubble wrap to the back of it in my ceiling and doors and installed the headliner.

The biggest thing I did improvement wise was to fill in the cross brace in my slider door with heavy black tar, some kind of non-hardeining glue, the old glue was dried and was doing nothing, my door was a very large cymbal, had a nice long ring with a knuckle rap.

I have heard a lot obout making improvements in the front wheel wells, I am interested in hearing what others have done.

I am thinking about building a temporary suspension system in the holes under my seat for the jack, a mag light, and a fire extinguisher and then filling around them with spray foam insulation, some of the audio geeks at work have described it to me, besides filling the holes under my seats with foam insulation it will mean that my mag light, jack, and fire extinguisher are now sitting in foam rather than rolling around in there.

Lets hear some success stories.

Thanks,
