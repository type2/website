Subject: 1973 vw automatic bus.. how to mount engine?

1973 camper bus, I just put a rebuilt subaru EA81 in it..

I notice I can push down (toward ground) on rear (pulley) end of
engine, and the engine/tranny will rock (pivoting on transmission
rear mount, which is to frame)..

I have a few options for my motor mounts...

1)rock rear of engine all the way DOWN, so nose of tranny is
all the way up.
2)rock rear of engine all the way up, so nose of tranny is all
the way down
3)somewhere between 1 and 2

Any suggestions on how I should do it?

is it normal for the trans to rock like this, or am I gonna have to
replace the front trans mount?
