Yes the plugs, wires, points, condenser, rotor, coil are all new. I set the
lifters less that 1K ago. I set the timing yesterday using a timing light.
7.5 deg btdc. I originally had it set to 7.5 btdc statically but that was
wrong. Pretty sure the coil wires are correct. I have bypassed the cold
start system entirely. If I pull the plugs after it shuts off they are black
as charcoal. Not oily, just black. Second set of plugs. 

I have replaced the fuel pressure regulator but am going to try to test the
fuel pressure today.
