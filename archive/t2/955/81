Subject: AutoStop Propane Fill Valve Replacements.

I'm not sure if I have mentioned this before, but I am carrying an Auto
Stop replacement fill valve for all Vanagon Westfalia's with
non-functioning, or broken, froze up fill valves.
It's a direct fit item, and comes with a new bleeder valve too.

This will eliminate any further fill up problems at any propane fill
station.

I also have Type 2 Westy fill & bleeder valves sold as a set.

All are brand new in the box valves.

Drop me a line if your needing to get gas in your propane tanks
effortlessly.

Take Care,

            ______________
