Subject: schematic of late bay rear frame

How does the right rear frame look, the part that has the right rear bumper
bracket bolted to it??

One of my captured nuts is free, where the right bumper bracket is suppose
to attach, and that section also is slightly bent.  I am trying to consider
if it would be practical to have a section cut out of a donor or have the
body shop just cut the existing frame section and re-weld the captured nut
and the frame.

Busted Bus, if you want to pipe up here, I would appreciate it!!
