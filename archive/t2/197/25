contrary to common belief..castrol does make a gl4,  the make two hypoid 
oils. hypoid and hypoid c.
the hypoid c is gl5 and the plain hypoid is gl4.  the problem is that it 
gets mixed up on flaps shelves if they stock both. or like at the place 
i work a sales person stated that they all are gl5 without even looking.
