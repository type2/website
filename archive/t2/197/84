OK, then- You have more than 4 psi oil
pressure even when hot. And that's good ?!

More shims won't fix this problem.
You should be concerned with the #1 main
dowel pin hole. It was not designed
to accomodate your intended solution.

In addition, extra shims do not address
the loss of case clamping force, the crank will
"whip" and oval the case bores.
Bent / Broken crank? Seized bearings ? Rod failure ?

There is a good possibility this case can be
restored, but not for long. You are overdue.
