Subject: wood screws


In addition to Elmer's Glue and toothpicks you can drill out stripped holes
with appropriate size drill bit and use wood glue to glue in a wooden dowel
which can then be drilled for your screw.  Or, fill the hole partway (1/8"
to 1/4") with baking soda, add a drop or two of liquid Super Glue.  Repeat
until hole is filled, drill for screw.
