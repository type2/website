Subject: RE: [T2] VW Type 1 List

It's pretty quiet these days, some of the more opinionated
folks have moved on, so bickering hasn't been a problem, but
it does exist occasionally. You can pmail, you just
have to take the extra step of copying and pasting
the recipient's address.  Not much hassle compared to the
things we run into when working on our VWs. =3D20

IMHO, the occasional bickering is worth the wealth of knowledge
that is present.
