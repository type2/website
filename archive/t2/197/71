I have seen that also but it was done with "mini" guages.  These are 
almost impossible to find any more except in cheapie versions.  check 
flaps. the units were made by sun all you can get now is a triple set 
that has voltage, water temp, and ammeter i believe.  The oil temp gauge 
is no longer available in mini nor is the oil pressure gauge or the 
ammeter.
