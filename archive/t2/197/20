Here's my version. GL-5 is too slick. It allows the Porsche patent syncros 
in the T-II tranny to slip, not grab like they should, and they wear much 
faster. Once you wear through the spezial moly rough coating replacement is 
the only fix. All the early trannies that use this Porsche ring syncro 
design need the GL-4 spec to work properly without wear.
