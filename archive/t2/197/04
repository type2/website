Subject: Scat linkage for Kadrons

John, list et al,
bought the scat centrepull linkage from John Connolly, installed it for my
Kadrons on my bug, but two things.

1)  I take it I have to pull the linkage balls from the carbs themselves??
Seems like the only way.

2)  There is no setup for attaching the return spring on the linkage? What
to do??

Thanks, I'm waiting for this reply so I can finish today.
Courtney Hook
