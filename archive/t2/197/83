Subject: 81 CA Westy O2 Sensor

Hi Volks,

Last week my Dad replaced the aged exhaust on his CA-spec 81 Westfalia with
a 72-74 style muffler. They swapped out one heater box, and did away with
the crossover pipe (which was full of pinholes like the muffler).

The shop that did the installation did not install the O2 sensor. They told
Dad that without the sensor the FI would use the "default setting".

Is this acceptable, or should we get the sensor re-installed? What size tap
is required to thread the exhaust manifold?

Thanks!


Happy trails,
