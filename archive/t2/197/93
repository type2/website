Subject: Title Retrieval/Valve Ajustment

2 Questions:

1.)  I am purchasing a 72 Westy that was impounded.  The person who owned
this bus didnt pay the impound fee. How do I get the title for this bus? (I
live in upstate new York)

2.)  Can someone give me a quick tutorial on how to ajust my vavles on my 70
westy? she is a 1600cc

Thanks Guys and Gals!

Frank
