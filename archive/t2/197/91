Chris,

Make sure the choke isn't sticking closed. It needs +12 volts going to =
it to keep it open (assuming your bus has the standard Solex PICT 34 =
carburetor). If the choke is closed, or even partially closed,  the =
fuel/air mixture will be way too rich and power and fuel economy will =
suffer. Otherwise, check the fuel mixture screw, points dwell, ignition =
timing, air filter, etc.

Your stock '71 bus should be getting something like 17-21 mpg at highway =
speed, depending on winds, terrain, elevation, cruising speed and so on.

Good Luck,

R.D.
'79 Bus
