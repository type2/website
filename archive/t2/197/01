I asked this yesterday, with no takers. So I will modify my ? a bit.  I =
need the 2 screws that hold the steering lock assembly into the =
boss(thing that goes around steering column)  Does any one know where I =
can get these screws OR does anyone have the specs on the screws and I =
can find them myself at lowes or somewhere.  ANY help would be great.

Thanks
