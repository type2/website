Subject: FW: [T2] doing push rod tube seals this weekend

I started late in the afternoon but I got the one side done that drips.  Not
hard but a lot of cleaning work and it's murder or your neck under there.

The spring retainer can be hard to get into position.

I had some trouble with one seal almost getting pinched but I backed out the
tube and corrected it.  I'm going to remove all the grime underneath with a
degreaser and wash up to see what's going on now.  It was pretty grimy.

The old seals popped out easily compared to the new Vitons that went in.
The large orange seals were soft and loose and the small black ones were
hard and tight.  My leaks were coming from the head end.

I replaced my bails and valve covers at the same time because they were all
rusted.  Skipped the valve adjustment. ;-)

I checked the lifters and they were rock hard.  Engine had been sitting for
a week so I think that's a good sign; I put them back in with the oiling
hole on top.

Subject: [T2] doing push rod tube seals this weekend

 I've got a couple of leaks at the push rod tubes that I'm going to attempt
to remedy this weekend.  I bought a set of Viton seals from Bus Depot
figuring I might as well do them all while I'm under there.

What kind of grease am I supposed to apply to the seals before I install
them?  Also, I was planning on following Bartnik's advice and using grease
on the valve cover gaskets.
