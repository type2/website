Subject: Armchair appraisal (how much is my bus worth?)

Volks, I could use a little help valuating my Westy. I think I would like to 
sell or trade it sometime in the next year. Thanks a whole lot for any 
response and happy 4th of July everyone.

1971 Westfalia Campmobile

White exterior, nice paint, original interior with good canvas, virtually 
rust-free top and bottom, no dents in body, one on rear bumper. I don't 
believe this bus ever saw winter until I bought and drove it to Colorado 
last year.

It has a new-case engine with 24,000 miles, rebuilt transmission with less 
than that. New driveshafts and ball joints, brakes and bearings serviced, 
sag corrected (theoretically). Did the above stuff myself including the 
drivetrain install, though I had a shop build the engine and trans.

The bus is very solid and pretty stock with a couple of nice touches like 
white coating on the rims and yes, gauges and a decent stereo. The curtains 
aren't original and there are speaker holes in the door panels and the rear 
wood panel over the bed. The canvas on the cot is shot. I'm rebuilding the 
sink/icebox. It has the child's cot.

It needs door work (window seals, etc.) and seat recovering, the paint job 
while still good is aging and the rock chips are beginning to rust. The 
brake booster never has worked and I never have cared, since those discs 
make it stop much better than my '69 ever did. Even has new flex hoses.

Believe it or not, one of the auto associations (forget which, not NADA) 
lists the value of a '71 at something like $8,000-$14,000 (!). Seems awfully 
high to me, especially since they value most split windows a bit lower. '71 
really is a sweet year but I just don't believe that figure.

Thanks for your help!
