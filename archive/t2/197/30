Subject: Re: [T2] bus parting in Pittsboro NC

No disrespect meant and I do not know the party in question but there 
is no way I would pay $5 for the privilege of receiving information 
that may or may not be of value to me.  There are places in NC with 
buses and they will be glad to tell you what they have in the yard 
for FREE.

Thanks
