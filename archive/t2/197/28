Subject: Re: [T2] I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain Passes

I get the slight odor with my westy as well.  The thing is that gas 
vaporizes quicker at higher altitudes which means even the most minute 
vapor leak is going to be noticed.  I got rid of almost all of my gas 
odors by replacing the lines to the canisters.
