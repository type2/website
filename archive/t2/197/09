Subject: why not GL5?..the answer and a question


Folks, after reading a lot of comments about you *must* use
GL4 trans oil instead of GL5, I wondered why, why ,why....here is the 
answer.

But a question first....anyone ever use the Ford friction modifier
additive in their manual trans?  I will have 1/2 of a 4oz bottle
left over after I change out my F**d manual trans soon.  The folks
at the F**d house(the only place I know of to get it) said that they
sell *lots* of it...and didn't know why!


Some parts snipped for brevity...

!!!Gear oil is acidic, motor oil is alkaline.

Gear oil needs very high wear protection 
Extreme Pressure (marked as EP). Therefore, it has a very high sulfur and 
phosphor content. Sulfur and Phosphate reactions start at a lower 
temperature, and Gear Oil has much more additive than motor oil. 

!!!This additive is corrosive to copper bearings and bronze synchro rings. 

Gear oils decompose at lower temperature, usually 250 F. Gear mesh in Gears 
literally chops up and cuts apart the long polymer chains of Viscosity 
Index improvers. Hypoid type gear sets have a sliding rather than rolling 
action, and therefore require much greater wear protection. Gear 
lubrication ratings go from GL1 through GL6. 

!!!GL4 is suitable for light duty hypoid sets. 
!!!GL5 has lots of sulfur,for heavy duty hypoids 
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

and used for heavy trucks and Tow Vehicles. GL6 is a heavier weight.

Cheers ,dave
