My 82 westy only got about 12 mpg when i first got it.  I get about 15 
mpg now.  that is just under what the orig vw rating was when new.  The 
westy is a heavier vehicle than the standard buses.  However yours does 
seem to be quite low.  my personal opinion is that an 009 dizzy doesnt 
belong on a heavy vehicle.  Vacuum advanced dizzy would respond better 
to the power curves of a loaded vehicle.
