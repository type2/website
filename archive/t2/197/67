With respect to your experience, I like having a tach on my dash. I use it 
as a shift pointer when the stereo is loud and I can't necessarily discern 
the engine speed. I probably drive by it more than the speedo. But what it 
really does is keep me from lugging the engine. Helps to keep it above 2,000 
in the low gears and 2,500 in the top ones - important for a Type I - and 
shift no later than 4,400. It's hard to do that without a tach. I'd say get 
one.

The rest of it I agree with. Oil gauges up front, definately, and vacuum is 
a great indicator for your engine. Oh, and if you really want to know what's 
up with the charging system, wire an ammeter. I wish I had one.
