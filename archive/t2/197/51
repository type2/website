Subject: practical CLASSICS, 54 & 79 campers

I flew back fro LAX to San Jose yesterday and bought a British magazine 
called practical CLASSICS that cost $8:29! But it has a neat 4 page article 
in VW campers and compares British campers of 54  79 years.
I probably will scan in the 4 pages but feel that I should not put them up on 
my site. I anyone feels it is OK to put it up let me know or if you want a 
copy of the JPEG's.
