 Hi Volks, I will be in the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area next week and was
wondering if any events, activities, or such are happening. I will be
checking my mail, so if anyone wants to meet for a drink/etc. let me
know. I'll get the first round..... TBear

Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
