     Well, I have my first sorta serious problem.  I went to fill the =
bus yesterday & fuel came leaking out from the left side.  I am assuming =
it is one of the hoses to the tank.  Maybe both are bad.  I know the top =
one is available from Bus Depot but the bottom hose is NLA.  I have =
searched the archives & believe that the 2 1/4" ID fuel hose from NAPA =
will work for both hoses.  Is this correct?  Does anyone know how many =
feet I will need?  I have the microfiche of the area but it is not =
really to scale.  This is scary stuff.  I want to fix this this weekend.
