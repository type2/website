I seem to recall that a guage from a true type IV or is it the type III
will fit there, I played with doing it and there was a pod from another VW
product that did fit there.....hmmm might have been out of that Audi 100LS
I had years ago.... I do know there is something from another VW product
that will fit there, I did it on another Bay I had many years ago 

sorry not more help than that
