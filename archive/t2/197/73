first you have to determine if it is a mechanical or electrical gauge.  
Look on the back and see if it has a little hose fitting.  If it does I 
recommend getting a new gauge with electrical sender.  If it is for an 
electrical sender (just 3 or 4 wire terminals on the back) then  all you 
need is a sender from bus depot or other suppliers. get the dual output 
one that has the idiot light and gauge terminals.  this will replace the 
standard oil pressure sender.
