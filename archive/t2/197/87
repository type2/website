Subject: Wynstar Tire

Sorry to beat a dead horse, but this is the tire I am considering because it
is the one my FLATS can get that will meet all the criteria. I posed this
question before, but now I have found a picture of the tire. Please let me
know what I can expect from this tread pattern. I have misplaced the specs,
but a prior check showed them to meet the standards.
