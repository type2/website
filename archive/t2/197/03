Subject: HCBF - Trading Buses Game Show

this year at the High Country Bus Festival

there will be another game show to play:  TRADING BUSES

Two bus owners will trade buses for the day and each will re-do something on 
the other's persons bus.  Perhaps some new cutains, a new jump seat, some 
cup holders................the possibilites are limitless.

Painting will not be allowed unless the bus owner says it is OK to paint his 
bus.

If you would like to sign your bus up for the competiton:  email Cliff 
Styles at:  Cliff.Styles(-at-)cmcsg.com

thanks,
Buddah
