If the lube is dirty or milky it should be drained and replaced. You 
symptom is caused by syncro wear. To accelerate syncro wear, run it on 
dirty lube or use other than GL-4 rated lube. GL-5 lube will kill the 
syncros no less than dirty lube. I use GL-3/GL-4 Valvoline 80w/90 available 
at NAPA.

Nothing will make it last forever. Longest life is acquired by periodic 
renewal of spec GL-4 fluid, BEFORE it gets dirty. As a rule of thumb, every 
4 years or 40,000 miles, but maintenance by inspection is the far more 
economical method.

For your current situation, drain and refill with GL-4. It might improve, 
but if it doesn't an overhaul or rebuilding is needed. Seek out AATransaxle 
in the Seattle/Tacoma area for righteous trans work, a VW/Audi/Porsche 
tranny expert. Tell them I sent you.

I have yet to see a synthetic rated GL-4 only. Don't use anything rated 
GL-5 or above. Standard dyno lube is far more ecomical in the long run, but 
I do think AATransaxel can suggest which standard or synthetics will do no 
harm.

Keeping the lube spec, topped up and clean is the key to long life.
