Ah!  you see, the difference is that I don't have a stereo.  I don't even
have a mono (not since college, anyway :-)  OK, I do, but it is broken and
I have never bothered to fix it.  I used to turn the radio on, but after 5
minutes, I'd miss the sound of the engine, get nervous, and turn it back
off.  To me the sound of my engine running smoothly is the sweetest thing
I can hear while I am driving (even for 14 hours! :-) And if my engine is
*not* running smoothly, well.... I want to hear that, too!

Some people like the tach in the dash, some people like a stereo in the
dash. it's a matter of taste.  Nothing wrong with either one, it's just
not for me.
