Subject: Smelling Gas on Mtn Passes -- Going Down

As an addendum to the previous post (Re: I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain
Passes), I have noticed a similar occurrence while roadtripping in my
girlfriend's 77 FI bus.  Whenever we climb a hill or mountain (or any
significant incline, for that matter) there are no noticeable fumes present,
but when coming back down that same grade the gas smell really becomes very
strong.  It always gives me the willies and makes look to make sure that the
fire extinguisher is still mounted back in the cabin.  Can anyone pinpoint a
source of gas fumes that only rears it's ugly head when the nose of the bus
is pointing down a hill?  Thanks!
