I'm currently running on my '79 bus some Goodyear LT tires that look =
like those.  These all-terrain tires came off medium-sized US Postal =
trucks. They cost $15 each, mounted and balanced.

They're good, tough tires with reinforced sidewalls (max pressure 65 =
psi). But they're LOUD. Really LOUD when going 45+ mph. It's hard to =
hear the stereo above the whine and vibration caused by these tires.

I'm going to order five new Yokohama Y356 Load Range D tires next week =
from the Tire Rack. They cost $57 each, plus shipping. Here's the link =
for more info:

I'm tired of yelling, "What'djewsay?" over and over.

Sorry to beat a dead horse, but this is the tire I am considering =
because it
is the one my FLATS can get that will meet all the criteria. I posed =
this
question before, but now I have found a picture of the tire. Please let =
me
know what I can expect from this tread pattern. I have misplaced the =
specs,
but a prior check showed them to meet the standards.
