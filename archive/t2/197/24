Subject: Re: List Help, and GL4 Trans Lube

I wish to thank the list for the extremely valuable help with several
upgrades I've been doing on my 70 bus. Advice I saved from Stevo was very
helpful, I just replaced the outer front door window scraper with an
extremely high quality VW brand scraper from Ron at Bus Depot. I also
replaced the Bus front door lock spring with help from the article from Ron
Van Ness. I would not have ever attempted either job without list advice.

Re GL4 trans lube- This is very hard to find. I looked everywhere, finally
found some at Canadian Tire- it is MotoMaster TDH Fluid-which is GL4. I will
be installing it in my bus and trike. Thanks to Dr. Tim.
