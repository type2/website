On several of the groups I sometimes find the bickering interesting as 
well.  I then try to find out why individuals can become so "set" on 
their choices (note i dont use opinion).  I have found that i can gain a 
wealth of knowledge by researching out the "discussion".  I see the same 
choice modes here but the bicker part is usually more controlled here.
