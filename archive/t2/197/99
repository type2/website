Pat, for the bottom right angled hose, I like to use a molded hose you can
buy at most any auto parts store: Gates (E) 70739 is the number, don't know
what it fits, but it is very close to the original, but will need trimmed a=
s
it is longer than stock.  Use your old hose to trim to size.

BTW, if you need the upper hose, Bus Boy's has them:  211-201-119=A0 Filler
Neck Collar and Elbow, Upper, 1974 All, 1975 to 1979 without Catalytic
Converter=A0 $32.90
