I have the same "problem" the radio iis on the floor up in the passenger

speaking of not runnning smoothly, put a new head on last weekend and
today had to run an errand and it sounded "funny" couldn't for the life of
me figure out what it was, it was running a little hot too (well it was 97
in the shade) so get where I was going and ran my errand while the engine
cooled off...brought out my package and threw it into the back,  wait
what's that...the hatch was cracked, evidently while I was last into it
I forgot no latch the hatch down and it worked open a little...really
makes a difference in the sound and cooling of the engine, ran about 15
degrees cooler too. 

oh well put in the dash what ever you want, just as long as you drive it!
