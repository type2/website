Subject: Help with crankshaft endplay (it's WAY out)

I’m helping a friend fix her ’71 Bug, which she has owned for 17 years. The 
front seal was hemorrhaging oil. Anyway, pulled the engine today and the 
crankshaft end play measured .76 mm (.025 in.), way too much by the 
rudimentary Muir gauge standard.

Everywhere I look it says put three shims under the flywheel but folks, I 
can’t correct the end play with three shims. It would take a fourth just to 
bring it down near the wear limit (no wonder the seal is trashed). I should 
mention that other than vomiting a quart of oil every 20 miles, this engine 
runs fine. She never drives it far enough to overheat it, and it obliges her 
by starting and idling and accelerating, the whole nine yards.

Can anyone tell me why one should only put three shims under there? Why not 
four? This car sees maybe 1,000 miles a year and if I can help my friend get 
five more years out of it, I’d like to do that. If it were my car it would 
put a new engine in it (this one came with the car, mileage unknown) but 
it’s not, it’s Sande’s. I’m prepared to tell her she needs a rebuild if 
that’s what the list says it must be. I’m just the mechanic. All I know is 
the end play is five times the legal limit and I can’t correct it with three 
shims.

Suggestions anyone? Thanks.
