Hi Melissa,

1. the fuel shut off solenoid, this should be little more than finger tight   1/3 to 1/2 turn with a spanner. If it was loose then it would be causing a vacumme leak significant at idle and tightening could be all thats required to restore the steady idle.

2. loose choke. Is it just the contact on the choke which is loose or the whole thing? The contact is rivited onto the choke cover and it may be possible to tighten the rivit with a hammer and centre punch or to apply a dab of solder to restore a good firm connection. to do either of those you would need to remove the choke mechanism. If the circular peice to which the wire connects is loose then it may just be a case of tightening the screws and adjusting the choke. The screws are in a collar around the central part of the choke with 3 screws equaly spaced around it. The screws can be seen by looking from the right hand side and may not be obvious, but if missing then the collar and choke assembly would simply fall off, so my feeling is that they are there.
Again incorrect opperation of the choke would cause a bad idle particularly when the engin is cold.

3. Choke/cut off electrics. both of these should to the  ve side of the coil. If you connect to the wrong side then the van will simply not start as the fuel cut off needs the 12v in order to allow fuel through.

It may be that your problem may be fixed with out having to use the new carb and a kind supplier may be willing to give a refund less postage on return of the carb. It's worth tightening the cut off solenoid, adjusting the choke and connecting the electrics before getting the new carb out of the box

Good luck
