Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel bay?

Somewhere in Michigan there is a place that sells VW parts called 
Parts Place. They mainly cater to the watercooled VW crowd and sell 
new and used parts. I have one of there catalogs around here 
somewhere and they make reference to putting diesel 1.6 and 1.9(non 
TDI) motors in bay window buses. They also make note that for some 
applications they have instructions written by customers who were 
successful in making the swap.

........daydreaming about a TDI powered 1968 bus............

Thanks
