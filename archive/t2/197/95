Rik,

I think that you have two problems.  First, you may not be bleeding the
brakes.  Second, they may not be adjusted properly.  You are *not* going
to like this, it is quite arduous, but...

First, put each corner of the bus up on a jackstand.  Adjust the shoes all
the way in.  All eight of them, front and rear shoe on each wheel.
Remove the drum and free up any stuck adjusters. Once they are all the way
in (check this with a flashlight and mirror), start adjusting them back
out, using the same number of "clicks" on both the front and rear shoe of
each wheel.  Keep adjusting until the wheel won't turn.  Do this on all
four wheels.

Second, bleed the brakes.  With the shoes up against the drums, each press
of the brake pedal will produce a fairly healthy squirt of fluid.  Bleed
until the fluid runs clear (this won't take long for you, since you have a
new MC and, no doubt, new fluid thru the system).

Third, adjust the brakes.  Pick each wheel back up and deadjust each wheel
until it spins freely.  Remember, same number of clicks on both shoes.
The idea is to keep the adjusters "centered".  Once a wheel is spinning
freely, start bringing the shoes back up.  as they begin to touch the
drum, press on the brake pedal 5-10 times and try again.  You will find
that for the first 3-4 times, they come in contact with the drum, but
after you pump the pedal a bit, they are not in contact any more.  Move
them out a notch or two and try again.

Do this until all eight shoes are barely touching the drum and you will
find that you have *much* better brakes, that the brake pedal is high and
hard, and that the parkling brake will actually hold the bus on a hill.
It will take most of a day, but it is the only real solution.
