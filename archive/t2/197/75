Richard,

There are two different kinds of vacuum in a VW motor...  manifold vacuum
and ported vacuum.

Ported vacuum is picked up at and slightly above the
throttle plate.  It is near zero at idle and increases as you open the
throttle for a while, then begins to fall off as you approach WOT (wide
open throttle).  This is perfect for the vacuum advance.  You don't want
the advance to kickj in at idle, you want it to come on as you open the
throttle.

Manifold vacuum is measured anywhere below the throttle plate.  It is high
at idle, drops as you open the throttle.  Manifold vacuum is used for most
vacuum powered accesories (like your disc brakes (and windwhield wipers on
old GM cars :-))

You want to monitor manifold vacuum.  Look for a vacuum port on the intake
stacks, the balance tube, or (my favorite) the hose for the vacuum assist
brakes.
