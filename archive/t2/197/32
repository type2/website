Subject: Re: [T2] I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain Passes

I spent a Fourth of July in Leadville, CO, replacing the fuel lines to
the canisters (the evaporative cooling system).  I had replaced every
inch of fuel line the prior year, except for the three or four pieces
in the evaporative cooling system.  How'd I find the leak?  Well, there
was gas pouring out after I filled up.

The point being, it might smell only at high altitudes NOW, but you
never know when it's gonna start leaking.

Have a great Fourth everyone...
