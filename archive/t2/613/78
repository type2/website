Since you're pulling the motor anyway -- repaint all the tin black.
Silver/chrome tends to reflect radiant heat -- whether it does so
enough to actually raise engine temps is a religious war that should
probably not be discussed.

OEM tin would cool MUCH better no matter what color it is but I with you. Get rid of the chrome.
