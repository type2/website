Subject: DIY $10 rear hatch seal...

Listees,

Ok I'm like the worst guy on the list in terms of mechanical skills but 
after being unable to locate a rear hatch seal (my Westy didn't have one at 
all) for less that ~70 (I could only find German). I'm sorry, I love my 
"new" westy but she just doesn't deserve such a high priced German part.

So I made a trip to Home Depot. They have this black weather stripping that 
works perfect and cost ~10 with alot left over. From what I understand this 
seal is essential for keeping water and exaust out of the compartment.

Also I have a fridge/sink unit and upper cot I won't be using and want to 
pass it on to someone that  can:
