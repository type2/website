the problem wasn't the ability, heck I had the equipment and had sprayed
Imron,  the problem was I could not take the bus out of service for more
than a single day.  it was my only ride

so I did in one day a full prep of a single panel on the bus primed, ate,
painted. cleaned up.   so took 9 weeks or so one day a week painting. (3
side panels each side, front, back, roof) started on roof, then passenger
side front door area, then worked around the bus doing the front last.

probably cost a lot more than what it would have to fire up my compressor
and do it "right" but it was do it that way or don't paint at all.

so did the best I could under the circumstances, I don't really reccomend
it, but it will work
