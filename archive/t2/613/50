Subject: About DIY painters & spray guns

Hey Roberto,
               Your advice is 'right on the mark' as they say in the US, 
or 'spot-on' as my English friends used to say.  The worst one can do is 
prevent rust from worsening, and that is no bad thing.  I am dealing with a 
vehicle (non VW) where the paint peeled from the primer, and then the primer 
rusted through.  It took sandblasting to remove the mess, and because the 
sandblast guy was afraid of warping/distorting the metal, I had to do hours of 
hand work after that.  Thank heavens for a 5 hp compressor and DA (dual action 
pneumatic sander).  In 20-20 hindsight, I would say even a careless paint job 
would have saved more of the surface.  Enjoy your oil supplies in Venezuela!

Glenn

..I have been following the discution about DIY painters and spray guns on VW
Type 2, based upon my own experienced I can tell you all a few things that
my help.
First of all the worst you can get after you paint your bus by your self is
a bad paint job, BUT if you decided to do it was because your previous paint
was bad anyway, of course at this point the monetary issue arouse, and the
question is, why should I spent time, money and elbow grease to get a bad
paint job as the one I already have?, belive me whe I said to you, If you do
it with certain amount of love and care (two essentials if you own a vintage
VW) and with the help of the list it is almost impossible to do it wrong.
My first paint job was on my 1965 bug that becaeme very well (my friend, no
friens and some profesional painters said so) of course no a show winner but
I got a nice puntuaction in a small local show (the winer was unbetable),
then I paint my 1976 Westy in my outdoor garage, whit even better results.
My recomendations are do it, if you are not 100% sure to buy or not the
necesary equipmet, borrow or rent it, you can always buy it in another time,
spent your time in the prep stage, hand sanding and color sanding, a paint
job is as good as the condiction of the base, get a descent products that no
mean the expensiest ones just good enough to acheive a good result and
finally ask, ask and ask, ask to your friends, ask profesional, ask to the
list and even ask me, if I can help in anyway I will.
Do it, it is the name of the game.

Greetings from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela

Roberto
