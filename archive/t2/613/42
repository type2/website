Subject: About DIY painters & pray guns

Hello Volks

I have been following the discution about DIY painters and spray guns on VW
Type 2, based upon my own experienced I can tell you all a few things that
my help.
First of all the worst you can get after you paint your bus by your self is
a bad paint job, BUT if you decided to do it was because your previous paint
was bad anyway, of course at this point the monetary issue arouse, and the
question is, why should I spent time, money and elbow grease to get a bad
paint job as the one I already have?, belive me whe I said to you, If you do
it with certain amount of love and care (two essentials if you own a vintage
VW) and with the help of the list it is almost impossible to do it wrong.
My first paint job was on my 1965 bug that becaeme very well (my friend, no
friens and some profesional painters said so) of course no a show winner but
I got a nice puntuaction in a small local show (the winer was unbetable),
then I paint my 1976 Westy in my outdoor garage, whit even better results.
My recomendations are do it, if you are not 100% sure to buy or not the
necesary equipmet, borrow or rent it, you can always buy it in another time,
spent your time in the prep stage, hand sanding and color sanding, a paint
job is as good as the condiction of the base, get a descent products that no
mean the expensiest ones just good enough to acheive a good result and
finally ask, ask and ask, ask to your friends, ask profesional, ask to the
list and even ask me, if I can help in anyway I will.
Do it, it is the name of the game.

Greetings from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
