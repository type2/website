Chris is right, Blake.

Part of the pleasure of getting your first bus is the complete change 
in your entire system of beliefs and habits that goes with it. One of 
those joys is that you will always be planning for your next engine. 
Owners of watercooled vehicles dread having to change out an engine. 
Aircooled owners look at the task as a privilege and a welcome 
challenge.

Getting your first bus is sort of like having your first child, with a 
plus. It changes your life. Plus this: if you don't like the way it 
changes your life, you can always sell the bus.
