Blake,

Don't take it too bad,  You get to get rid of some stuff, clean some stuff 
and then put the proper sheet metal back on the engine.

At that point, it might last ok enough for some time.  The biggest deal is 
to get rid of the junk and make it cool again.

Heat is the **major** enemy of the VW engine and recirculating hot air
from anywhere into the engine is **always** bad.

Stick with the list and we will get you through it.

Sit and just look at your engine, identify what is what and whether it 
really looks right from an engineering stand point.  Seeing the ground or 
outside the engine compartment thru the bottom or around the engine means 
recirculating hot air...therefore your cooling problems.

Find pics or someone with one done right and park next to them and 
look...or take pics of yours and go look for pics on the net of what it is 
supposed to look like.  Compare....take your time.

Cheers, dave
