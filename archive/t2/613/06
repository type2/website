Subject: Re: [T2] will stock air cleaner fit new carbs???

Mike asked:


 I just found a 72-74 dual carb air cleaner, can I use this with my
dual Kadrons??? It would make hooking up the oil breather and charcoal
canister ahelovalot easer!!!

Well..... 72 only is round, metal, and is an oil bath air cleaner.
73-74 is square, plastic, and has a paper element.
The 73-74 assembly is taller than the 72 assembly.
[no such thing as a 72-74 USA air cleaner :)]
