Understand you are talking about a 55-60 mph vehicle. They go faster and wear out faster too. 

A/C is out there but the engine has to 100% to make it work without killing the engine. You've got 50-60 HP pushing 3500-4000 lbs. A/C requires horsepower. 

RUST and collision damage are your biggest concerns. I would look for the most unaltered, unmolested, original van you can find because it seems alterations are seldom done correctly. Learn how to tap around or use a magnet to inspect for rust. Fresh repairs may not always be a good thing unless you can ID a good repair. 

'68-'71 are Beetle powered. A bit more - um, rustic. Much simplier to work on. Cheaper. Also a bit older than the:

'72-79 models. Faster by a bit, more durable I think, more complicated, more difficult to find parts for because it did not share it's engine with the Beetle like the early Buses. I have a '78 b/c I like the interior layout better. And disc brakes. I also like the engine but I have a Corvair in mine for even more power (after I start it someday... <grin!>)

Watch out for poorly done repairs and "improvements" - witness the other thread we have going on right now about the GEX powered new addition to Blake's family. Hang in there Blake! 

Get out the books and learn what a good VW looks like (when it leaves the factory). It will help you ID missing or altered or incorrect parts. A good body and chassis is the important part - the rest are just parts that can be removed or replaced...
