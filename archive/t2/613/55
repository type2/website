Well I thought I understood that an electric fan would never cool an aircooled engine and certainly not one that would not be ducted directly to the engine. I'm talking about cooling the engine, not the oil. 

I have cooled the oil with an electric fan no problem... 

Can you provide pics? I'm facinated...
