Subject: friday topic= neon red ground marker paint

Since it's Friday.... your mention of the neon red ground marker paint brings 
last Friday to mind.  Driveway repaving guys drove over one of their cans of 
neon red ground marker paint.  No surprise, the can fractured and took off like 
a rocket.  Good news: it did not hit a human being.  Bad news: it shattered the 
right rear window in my van/wagon.  Actually I wonder about the human being 
part, since the crew denied any knowledge of what happened -- though I had seen 
the window was OK just that morning, and the following morning I took the 
fractured can out of the crew's garbage container.  Did I mention the track of 
neon red ground marker paint along the grass?

Time to call my friendly local lawyer ;-))

Subject: friday topic!  rotors and hubs

When we were talking about what to do with old hubs and rotors....

I actually used a couple of hubs last weekend!

At the Eureka springs show we need a few more traffic control 
device(barrels/cones)...so I bought a couple of 1 1/2" short threaded 
metal nipples, a couple of plastic pipe couplers that would thread on to 
them and a 10' section of 1 1/2" plastic pipe.

Tack weld the nipples on the hub, cut the plastic pipe into two 5'
sections and glue on the couplers and !eureka! two sign holders or orange 
ribbon holders.

I had an old can of neon red ground marker paint, so I painted the
poles and the hubs with it.  Worked great.
