Subject: Re: [T2] Bringing the Bus home.

Argh, this doesn't sound encouraging at all. I'm so excited about the 
prospects for this bus, but I also don't want it to become a money pit. 
I bought this in hopes of cleaning it up to become my daily driver. 
What kind of precautions can I take that will help to keep this bus on 
the road? It only cost me 1800 so I knew I would have to put some more 
cash into it, but I wasn't expecting to replace the engine.
