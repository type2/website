Subject: Supplemental Engine fan...

Hi all...

with all the talk of electric fans I got to thinkin'.

Just for the record, I have no plans to modify the stock, complete cooling
system in my bus.... ever..

But.... I was at my local VW guy's shop last week and he had a beautiful
1966 Westy with a DP 1600 in it. Splittys are all but extinct in eastern
Massachusetts. This bus had a big electric fan mounted on the drivers side
of the engine compartment sucking air into it from the vent. Not an oil
cooler, just a fan. I guess this is to supplement the engine cooling fan.

My question: will this fan actually lower engine temps?


Anyone have experience with fans in there just for cooling?

Thanks
