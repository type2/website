Subject: Bus ramblings continued 205T distributer vs 009

I have had a few days to run the 205T (vacuum only) distributor.  I 
have two concerns:

I am finding that the engine runs hotter, especially when pulling long 
hills.

My seatofthepants observations includes a smoother take-off from dead 
stop, but slower acceleration through the higher RPMs.  My power curve 
has taken a turn for the worst.  It doesn't seem to maintain a good 
torque at the higher RPMs.  Full advance is about 35 degrees, which is 
within specs.  I set it at 0 degrees at idle, but perhaps I should 
retard it a little?

I think I liked the 009 better.
