The Harbour Freight guns are pretty good, considering the exceptionally low
cost.  The only problem that I have had is that it is uncomfortable after an
hour or so of use, but the spray is just fine.

Other low cost options are Transtar.  They are about 1/2 the cost and pretty
much equivalent to SATA.
