Subject: free bus, long island

I have a 73 bus sitting in my driveway that I need to get rid of.
It hasn't run in 4 years, the engine was blowing oil when it did run. The
body has rust. The interior is good. I have a 71 one that I'm working on and
I just don't have the time or money to do anything with the 73.I'd really
hate to just have it towed. 
Thanks,
tom
