Subject: friday topic!  rotors and hubs

Folks,

When we were talking about what to do with old hubs and rotors....

I actually used a couple of hubs last weekend!

At the Eureka springs show we need a few more traffic control 
device(barrels/cones)...so I bought a couple of 1 1/2" short threaded 
metal nipples, a couple of plastic pipe couplers that would thread on to 
them and a 10' section of 1 1/2" plastic pipe.

Tack weld the nipples on the hub, cut the plastic pipe into two 5'
sections and glue on the couplers and !eureka! two sign holders or orange 
ribbon holders.

I had an old can of neon red ground marker paint, so I painted the
poles and the hubs with it.  Worked great.

Easy to take apart, easy to carry.

metal nipples          about $1.58 each
plastic couplers       about $ .57 each
10' of 1 1/2" plastic pipe   $3.24

These would make great stands for almost anything drill holes in the
plastic pipes, and put signs on them.....cut the tops of the plastic
pipes at an angle(and shorter), glue on another piece of plastic(or wood) 
and make a book or literature stand.

Bus content...they were easy to pack, but paint the hubs and poles with 
something besides marker paint(it rubs of easily).  And clean the grease 
off the hubs first!!!!<grin>

Cheers, dave
