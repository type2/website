Here is how I wired my ammeter.

You only need to bring one cable (one conductor) from the back to the front 
of the bus and use the
existing connector (splitting) points in under the dash to connect the 
ammeter to the electric system.
When the battery is charging you have a positive reading and negative when 
discharging (even when
the ignition is not on). Hope it helps,
