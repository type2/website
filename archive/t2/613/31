Chris,

Try it on a another car with std points first to make sure it is 
working....maybe you already did that?

Combo's of wires might be bad....need power, ground, and signal from 
points.

Cheers, dave

Not sure if this diode method would work.  
Tried all combos of wires, even + off coil.  
Short of getting an adaptor, anyone have a similar issue or know of a solution?
