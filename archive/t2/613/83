I'm not sure who VolksTech is, but I would put my wallet in my front pocket and step away 
from the place quickly.

I am surprised they didn't say WHOA look at the chrome! Get that Taiwanese junk out of there! And GEX? Scary at best. 

The fact that they did not comment on those as being dodgy items is worrisome.
