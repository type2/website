Will-after you have sprayed the paint, turn your air compressor up a bit
(assuming you are shooting around 30psi or so) and walk around the bus and
shoot bugs off with the air nozzle. If you don't have it too high the bugs
will fly off and not move/damage your fresh paint. You will spend a while
doing this, but then you won't have any bugs or places where you put your
fingers on the coat too soon to remove them. Left behind legs can be pulled
off with a tweezer (I know this sounds morbid, but it's a reality).

Let me second that....I sprayed my hightop with it and it came out FABULOUS.
Very UV resistant and sticks well.
