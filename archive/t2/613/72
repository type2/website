Blake,

A "PO" is "previous Owner", who will now be referred to as 

"the Evil PO"

Arrrrggghhh!  So, you get 5 or more years of VW education in a single day.

You have said the magic **bad** word....."GEX".  I'm not sure who 
VolksTech is, but I would put my wallet in my front pocket and step away 
from the place quickly.

The general consensus on this list is that GEX is sure death and anyone 
that has one will be replacing it sooner rather than later.  I think some 
of the guys have managed to keep theirs together for a few thousand miles, 
but they are not known for their longetivity.  See the original comments 
that you quoted below....had we known it was GEX...welll....

I'm sure other will chime in on this topic, but you now have lots of 
interesting options....

Cheers, dave
