Blake,

Ok, what you have, as Mark said is a "cheap" fan shroud that should still 
have a fan in it to blow cooling air down over the engine....the 
additional part looks to be a separate fan/cooler *just* for the oil.

And! in a dumb place cause where does the hot air from it go?...looks to 
me to go right back on the engine...this is *bad*.


Blake, *with engine off* reach around behind where the back side of the 
generator would be and see if you can feel the impeller blades of a fan
inside the shroud.

Ya need some serious "original" german metal on that engine in order to 
get it healthy.

Time for you to buy the Bentley manual and look at the pics of an original 
type 1 engine...then you will know what it should look like.

Cheers, dave
