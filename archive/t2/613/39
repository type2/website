House paint sucks on steel. For the same cost why don't you go to Tractor Supply and get a few gallons of their tractor paint and go that route. I have used some as chassis paint and I am very satisfied with it in that use. I have experiemented and it is prob equal to what they were using on cars in the 30's in shine and durability. I have worked on alot of cars of that era and some of the paint held up pretty good for 50 years old.  

I have sprayed this paint and using a foam roller I have rolled it on (we used it - something like it - at a sign company I once worked for). Roll it on and as it dries go back over it with the same roller to further smooth and flatten the texture of the paint. Leaves a nice gloss when done right. Each time to roll it (no additional paint on roller) use a lighter touch. Last roll just BARELY tough it. You can do the same with a fine brush around the drip rails. Spraying is MUCh better. 

It ain't a "real" paint job but it does keep the rust at bay, is designed for durability and weather exposure, designed for steel, and looks pretty good when applied correctly. I think you could do the exterior of the bus for $25 tops (prep materials extra). Tractor Supply also carries a primer to go with this very paint. CHEAP. Was $14 a gallon the last time I looked.

House paint doesn't fit the bill in about 19 different ways. EVERY mailbox, gutter, garage door I have ever seen was a rusty mess a few years after it was painted with house paint. I don't know if it lets the weather in or if something that is in the paint accelerates the rusting process. 

Good luck.
