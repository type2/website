Here are some pics.

What kind of fan is this?

Whatever kind of fan it is, it didn't keep the engine cool enough. I 
did the dip stick test when I stopped. And each time it was pretty hot 
when you touched it. Not boiling hot, but very hot to the touch. I 
would stop for 30 to 60 minutes open up the engine lid and let her cool 
down.
