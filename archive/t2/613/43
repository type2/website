Snoopy,

The intermittent part is the relay and switch on the column.

When you trun your wiper on for a second and then off, it continues to 
finish the wipe cycle, right?(it should).

All the relay and switch does is do a cycle like that for you.

Switch to low intermittent and the relay waits about 4 seconds or so and 
then gives enough power to the wipers to get them started on the sweep and 
then the power to them is turned off.  The sweep cyle finishes until the 
relay times out and starts the next cycle.

Doesn't have anything to do with the motor, but everything to do with the 
switch and relay.  Check BD and see that the wiper motor is the same for 
72-79 busses.

You can buy all sorts of aftermarket stuff(and kits you solder yourslef)
to do the same thing.

Cheers, dave
