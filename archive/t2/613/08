 I just found a 72-74 dual carb air cleaner, can I use this with my
dual Kadrons??? It would make hooking up the oil breather and charcoal

Well..... 72 only is round, metal, and is an oil bath air cleaner.
73-74 is square, plastic, and has a paper element.
The 73-74 assembly is taller than the 72 assembly.
[no such thing as a 72-74 USA air cleaner :)]
