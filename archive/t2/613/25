i sure hope you are right rob... that was my first thought was a vaccum leak... as the manifold got hotter and hotter the chirping went from just that to screetchign reminded me of a tea kettle.. thats why i suspected a air leak at the manifold...?
starting to worry that it might be the valve guide sticking though....? arg&^*&^*& going to start today by first repalcing the manifold and reseating it again this time with the fatty gasket instead of the small ones i used...
wish me luck...
gotta get back on the road,..
daily driver here
peace

You have a vacum leak. Check where the carb bolts to the intake, there
should be a gasket there. It will cause your pop corn popping and lose of
power. If you have to, use some RV Sealant or similar at the carb base.
However if one is ok then the other should be fixable. Check all your bolts
and make sure everything is tight too. You could possible have a warped carb
(let's hope not). While you have it off check to make sure the carb base is
flat and true.

Good luck and let us know how they run when fixed.
