Subject: [T2] 1 of 2 dual carbs whining at me bad

ok just installed new dual carbs 34 mm solex with electronic chokes... 

why after adjusting them did one begin to holler at me like a whining fan belt...? sounded at first like a bird chirping..? then the next thing it was hollering like a fan belt screetching really bad...? 
could this be a result of the manifold getting hot and the manifold having a air leak...? 
also there is no power at all going down the road... and the screetching is hollering the whole way//? 

there is also some corn popping going on out the tail pipe like boom poom poot poot crackle pow boom.. not backfiring but popping... 

backfiring i would consider something like off the beverly hillbillies..? 
i have also checked the timing and it seems to be still set at 7.5 bftdc where it was already before dual carb install.. 

this is my daily driver if anyone could please help me out here..? 
peace 
chris
