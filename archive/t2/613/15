Subject: Re: [T2] Spray Guns was DIY Bus Painting

do you have a Harbor Freight Tools where you are? if
so you can get a pretty sweet gravity fed HVLP for
like $49. I used this to spray my notchback and my
bus.. it has an adjustable tip down to the size of a
thick felt pen.. also you may pick up a good touch up
gun at lowes for like 29.. i have a campbell hausfeld
and it worked great, i sprayed a whole fender on my
notch that needed repaint.. this thing dials into like
a pin tip size.. 

dont by something expensive that your only going to
use very little, i have that cheap central neumatic
gravity fed gun and it worked great with all
applications..

good luck,
ps. use quality paint like PPG or the likes, it will
help your finishing techniques..
