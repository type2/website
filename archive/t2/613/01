Subject: RE: [T2] Weird Oil Pressure Light Issues

I found the solution to my problem so I wanted to share it with all of you.
Thanks to those who responded to my cries for help.

As mentioned, there were two things going on. 1. The extra oil and 2. The
Oil light.

First, the oil light. It turns out this was an issue with the oil pressure
sender. I didn't replace it, but simply took it out, cleaned it making sure
nothing was obstructing the sensor, re-routed the wire (it was seriously
stressed) and put it all back together. Either the wire had a loose
connection or the sensor had a particle that was obstructing it from working
when the oil pressure went up. Go figure.

As for the extra oil, I believe this is just a matter of being on a slight
incline in location a and an opposite incline at location b. I also noticed
a low rear tire. Perhaps I've sprung a leak?

Now it's off to Bend, Or to test out my new bus on it's first road trip.

Troy,

1/2" past full is too much...something is going on that is adding 
volume to your oil....and it was way too much for heat expansion.

You are sure that you weren't on any kind of an incline in either place?

Oil pressure light response *is* weird.....something is going on.

Connect a VOM on the ohms setting to the oil pressure sender and to 
ground(without the original wire.  Should be on(a short to ground) before 
starting and off(no connection to ground) after starting...if it changes 
becasue of speed then it is *very* weird.

Make sure you find out what is going on with the oil soonest....didn't
smell like gas did it?

Cheers, dave
