Subject: Re: [T2] Automatic Transmissions

For the bus
Before 75 was the .030 which was a 3 speed. Made to change gears using
vacumn
After was the .010 which was again a 3 speed which worked with the fuel
injected setup.

I have a .030 on my 1700 fi which has the vacumn lines attached to manifold
vacumn pressure
which works ok. I drive it like a clutchless standard :)  You do loose a
little power but
it's sweet for highway cruising and in town.
