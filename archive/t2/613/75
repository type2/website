I've heard that the vents in the earlier busses were just barely
enough when the engine is at high revs to allow adequate air in the
engine compartment. Hence the scoops that were added to many busses
before the bay window "Mickey's Ears".  A low pressure (vacuum)
situation in the engine compartment obviously isn't going to provide
the ideal environment for the air/fuel mixture or for cooling.

I would imagine that some kind of fan sucking fresh air from the
outside into the engine compartment would provide some benefit, but I
haven't seen any kind of empirical testing done.
