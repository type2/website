My first Bus was a '71 Westy that went through a couple engines - with
help from my wife - so the last one I put in I tried to improve my odds of
it lasting. I got a 6" fan, I think it was from some computer application,
and mounted it pointing at the left of the engine. I hooked it up to the
taillights so whenever my Berg dipstick thermometer started flashing me I
would turn on the running lights. That little fan would cool things down
about 10-15 degrees depending on the outside conditions. And the engine is
still going 10 years later (with a new owner).
