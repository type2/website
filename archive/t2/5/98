Hey David, yeah I remember you mentioning this before.  Fresh air duct to 
your carb.  But what about to the fan inlet?  Can you seal the fan to a 
fresh air duct?  I seems like it would help a lot.  The only problem I see 
is that there's not 6 inches of space in front of an upright fan so you'd 
have to flatten the 6" duct back there.  So my question remains: is this 
enough air?
