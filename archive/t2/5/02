welcome to the VWWorld, you might take some time and visit the library (if
it is back up) and read the excellent advice of Dr Tim and others on what
to look for when buying a bus

yes, and it would by far be the best thing to leave in it

anything other than a type 4 pancake engine would be a major pain to put
in, in fact I doubt there is any engine that someone hasn't stuffed into
one at some point or other, including small block water cooled American
engine.

I have a 78 and have the 2liter in it, but for many years the spare engine
I used when working on mine was a 1971, 411, 1700cc engine, and it was
more or less a drop fit, (with a 78 FI system added)
