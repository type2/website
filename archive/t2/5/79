Subject: Re: [T2] First time non-greeting from ACVW

Happened to me yesterday. It's the same guy I see in town all the time. I
think he may be a recent immigrant, so I'm giving him the benefit of the
doubt and I'll keep waving till he get's it.

So, of course I give a big, nice, friendly wave out the window.  I get
NOTHING from the bay window driver.  I look in my rear-view and my buddy
driving the Vanagon does the same as me, gives a big friendly greeting.
Again, NOTHING from the driver of the bay window! So, WTF
