Subject: AMIN - ebay posts


Hello all,
As the list charter clearly specifies, posts about items for auction on
ebay are not allowed on the list.

The list a while back had a vote on whether ebay postings should be
allowed.  The majority felt that ebay posts should not be allowed on the
list.

If you want to know what is for auction on ebay, I suggest you go there
and look.
