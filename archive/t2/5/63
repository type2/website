Subject: Fuel Injection Fuel Pump

I am transplanting a late model Fuel Injection system into my 74. I
understand the standard FI fuel pump delivers fuel at around 28 psi.
After pricing a correct VW pump $$$$ is there a less expensive
alternative such as a Purolator or Facet that will fulfill the pressure
requirements?
