Greetings,


Here is the scoop, I have a 77 FI Bus. I have two new batteries, new =
starter, and just replaced the alternator. When I pump the brakes my =
idle drops off and wants to stall. Prior to replacing the starter and =
alternator I was having some issues with power drain. An example would =
be when the lights were on and I used my turn signal there did not seem =
to be enough power to run them.=20

So do I have two issues going on now? vacuum to master cylinder and =
possible ground problems some where? Any ideas would be great!

Thanks,
Brett
