Subject: Odd Question

Hello Folks,
     Took today and tomorrow off work to get the '77 finished. One thing on
the list to do was change out the dashboard-idiot PO cut out the radio area
to install some cheesy POS radio he bought at a yard sale, then never
installed it. Anyway, it went fairly well with one exception-the plastic
duct from the center tube does not fit, when connected to the dash vents (on
top) it leaves about a 1 inch gap at the bottom where it connects to the
center tube. The dash is from a '76, and I can't believe anything would have
changed in the duct work from '76 to '77, but who knows. Everything else
lined up fine. I believe the duct work from the donor bus is still there,
but it is 50 miles away, and I won't be able to get until Monday. Side note-
I picked up a really cool roof rack at a yard sale, I should have some pics
posted of it by tomorrow.
