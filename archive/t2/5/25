Be sure to rock the motor back and forth with a wrench - that is slightly 
rotate the engine back and forth while you pull.

You might even clean the hole with carb cleaner, and glue the pencil in, 
pull out the drive, and then drill out the pencil later (wouldn't require 
any real effort nor damage the drive as the pencil wood would <!> 
disintegrate before the metal of the drive).

Some of the resistance that the drive will give seemed to be related to the 
stickiness of the oil.

BE SURE none of the shims falls into the engine.

I have removed about 5 or 6 this way. Really any wooden dowel would do the 
job if it fit tightly.
