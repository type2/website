Hey there Andree,

BTDT. When a stoopid Ch&vy p-up driver pulled into traffic without
looking and totaled my 78 Westy a couple of years ago, I had to deal
with the insurance co. and the "determine current value" thing. 

This is one of the reasons I post a "Buses FS (CT, MA, NY areas)"
message every other thursday. Ron Van Ness used to post these, and
these posts helped me w/ dealing w/ the ins. co. when I went thru
this.

Compile recent for sale ads for 1980 Westies. You can get these from
the archives and from vw club newletters ads (I used LiMBO's). There
are online price quides that will help establish "value". Your local
newstand probably has several price guides for under $10-$15. 

Don't accept their first offer, it will be low, and they'll hope you
accept it and be done with the whole thing.

I rejected the ins. co.'s, and made mention of the documentation that
I had compiled. I explained the prices I had from current and past
ads, from online price guides, etc. etc. If you can back up your
claims of "value" with documention, then they'll know you're not just
pulling their chain. I asked if they wanted me to fax them the
printed info I had, and if they wanted me to email them the links to
the online info. They said no, they would do more "research" and get
back to me.

They might tell you that your westy isn't worth much 'cause it's not
even in a price guide. That's BS. It's might not be in the "blue"
book, but the ins. co.'s (and anyone willing to spend a few bucks)
have access to the antique and classic price guides. I forget the
color, but mine was in either the yellow or green book.

I thought it was kinda funny that the ins. co. said that they
couldn't find any listing for my 78 in their "books". Their second
offer was exactly what was quoted for a "low #3" 78 Westy listed in
the price guide. "Couldn't find a listing", yeah, right.

After all the negotiating was done, I settled for twice the amount of
their original offer. I then asked what the salvage fee was, as I
wanted to keep the bus. It was $25 and well worth keeping for that
price (I had put on $300 worth of tires the day before the accident).

Remember, having the proper documention is the key to determining and
negotiating value. An appraisal and "stated value" policy before
something unfortunate happens to your bus is even better.

Hope this helps,
