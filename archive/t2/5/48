Hi Jeremy

What is it that is getting hot? , the battery?
If so,, clean the connections,,, 
I would take it to the local FLAPS or battery shop for a load test,, maybe one
cell is shorted,

We have a starter and alternator shop in town that will do a load test and
current test on your starter at the same time,, then they recommend what you
need to replace,, the test is free!

You may have a starter that has a problem,, 

If it isn't the battery or the starter...the next step is to disconnect the
battery +ve terminal... and install a test lamp from the battery +ve to the
cable that you just pulled off,,, if the light  comes on,, you have a "draw"...
if it is bright, then it is a real good draw,, and if it is dim ,, a tiny amount
of current is being used,,

keep removing the fuses until this light goes dead,,, or undo the radio
connections,,

undo any sell installed items first,, they are usually the culprit
