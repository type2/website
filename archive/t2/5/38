A lot of questions?  You're not kidding!  :-)

Lots to know here.  The 1.7 having a 210mm flywheel and clutch and the 1.8 
having either the 210 (early) or 215mm flywheel and clutch.  The 210 and 
215mm setups are completely interchangeable.  The 2.0 clutch/flywheel is 
228mm and will not quite fit into the 75's bellhousing but you can use the 
1.8 flywheel and clutch on the 2.0 engine.  Can't remember if the starter 
is the same or not.

Yeccchhhh.  Keep the FI if you can.

Yes.

It will work okay if the manifold has the port (you can add it if it doesn't).

Best way is to find a donor bus.  Most parts can be bought from Bus Depot 
and/or BustedVW both of whom are on this list.

It won't seem so daunting once you study it for a while.  Get the Bentley 
manual.  You can remove the diagnostic stuff if you want, you'll probably 
never use it.

That won't work well.  Most fridge compressors won't work off of the square 
or modified square wave produced by low-cost inverters.

>stops) and a 120v AC to 12v DC adaptor for when I'm stopped?

Much better.  Just remember that the peltier-device type (identifiable by 
their very low price and light weight) will only cool to 40 degrees below 
ambient air temp, and will take "forever" to cool stuff down.

>Or should I find a later Westy fridge and retro-fit?

Probably your best option.

>I would like to run just one battery with a high-amp alternator (see 1d).

I strongly recommend that you run at least two batteries.  Otherwise 
starting your bus after a night of camping will always be a guessing 
game.  You can't get a very high-amp alternator for the bus 
unfortunately.  Biggest available is about 70 amp and most are 55 amp.

Look me up, I'm in the book in Dallas, Tx. and on the AIRS list.
