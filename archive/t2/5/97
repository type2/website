Paul A ( and anyone else who missed the post )-
Following is a repeat of the original post  regarding
Mr and Mrs. Dave Luppy, who requested A.I.R.S.
assistance when their 74 Bus broke down this
week while on their honeymoon, traveling from
Manhattan and heading to St. Louis and Seattle.
Anyone who would like to contact them may
e-mail off-list for additional info.
Dave \X/ , A.I.R.S.
