Speaking of which, I'd like to know where to get the small
metal adapters that are bolted to the inside of the sliding
door and to which the second handle is bolted.  The handle
itself is a normal sliding door handle, but the adapters
are rather rare finds here in Germany.  Only one of my Buses
has one, and I'd like to fit the second handle to the others
too.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
