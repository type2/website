Subject: 80s bentley 4 trade

I've got a good condition bentley for vanagons.

Need bentley for bay window, ('68).

Anyone interested in a trade?

Til then, how do you get the instrument cluster out of
a 68? The (currently useless) heating knobs are in the
way.

Between fans, gauges, switches, blowers, Ham radios,
etc. FOs left a tangle of wiring back there.
