Greetings Listerinos,

70 Bus here.  

I'm having a little trouble (I think) with my sliding door.  When I close the 
door (from the outside) I need to push (slightly) against the rear of the 
panel to seat the door as I move the handle up to lock it in place.  Of 
course, that little shove one has to give the door makes the door impossible 
to close and lock from the inside of the vehicle.  That's not right, is it?

So.........a couple of questions.  Just what is the "action" supposed to be 
like when the slider closes?  And, assuming mine is a bit stiff, what is the 
most likely culprit?  I'll get my Bentley out and go through it, but I value 
the voice of experience first.

Thanks!

Mike
