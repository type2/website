Subject: RE: [T2] No Title Westy

I do not know about a bus specifically, but my father had a 60's Vespa
Scooter titled the same way. Basically sold the scooter to them and then
bought it back. When they bought it, they titled it in their state and then
gave him a bill of sale and a title when he bought it back. He then got it
registered in VA. Worked good for him since he made one scooter out of
several and all where found in the woods. He just grabbed one of the VIN
numbers.

Seems like it would work fine if you are sure this bus is not being looked
for. Hate to see you get it titled and fixed up, then the real owner decide
they want it. I am not sure what kind of legal rights they have to it, but
you may want to check into it.

Subject: [T2] No Title Westy


Hey Volks,
Im picking up a 1979 Westfalia in Seattle for cheap but the bus has no title
(long story).  Anyway, the bus is not stolen Ive already checked and the
process involved in getting a title in this state is Looooong.  The bus
doesnt even run so I cant even complete the first step involved in legally
doing it in Washington.  

So, per the advice of a listmember, I checked the archives and found the web
address of INternational Title Sevice in New Hampshire.  Which for $175
bucks and a couple of forms, I get a Maine registration and license plates
in 7 to 10 days!!   

Has anyone on the list done this before?  Just wondering if you forsee any
problems with getting it titled and registered in WA.  Maine does not
require a title to register vehicles over 10 years of age.  The price is
well worth the worry that my untitled westy could get towed and lost
forever.  

Thanks,
Chad Yunge
