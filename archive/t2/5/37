Gee. I just used my handy dandy magnet-on-a-stick tool and mine came right
out. Rocking the engine a bit probably helps as sometimes the gears seem
to bind a bit and sticky oil holds it down too. Handy dandy
magnet-on-a-stick is also good for retrieving the little spring that goes
in the hole in the center.
