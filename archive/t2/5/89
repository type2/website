Subject: RE: [T2] Engine temperatures

I don't have a tachometer, but my tires are stock size, transmission is
original and, as I had mentioned, I was doing 60 to 65 MPH, when I got these
readings.

I read in either the Bently book or Miur that the oil pressure relief valve
opens at 28 psi in a dual relief case, which I have.  Of course, my OP
readings with cold oil are much higher, like 55 to 60 psi.  My HIOP is about
5 psi.  With the new VDO OP sender (the one with outputs for both the gauge
and the idiot light), the oil ight comes on at hot idle, but this did not
happen with the old OP switch.  My idle may be adjusted a little too slow,
so that will get checked and fixed soon - before the next trip.  I'm using
10W40 oil, and I may switch to 15W40.

Your temperature readings make sense to me, even the oil cooler inlet being
hotter by 20 degrees, which I would expect.

I'm putting my faith in the gauges, too.

The readings seem really good for a heavy bus, in my opinion, the only one I
question is the oil pressure..How many RPM was the engine turning at
20-25PSI??

The Berg dipstick is not always accurate, the gauges seldom vary, with
sender relocations, as our test car has 4 senders, (sump, dipstick, and a
tapped main oil galley and one directly in the housing for the oil cooler
adaptor inlet)) The gauges are all VDO, and they stay within 10 degrees of
each other, except  the one going into the cooler, which is almost always 20
degrees hotter.

Contrary to what the heavens may say, I still believe in gauges..
