Make sure that "U" shaped joint at the rear of the door is lubed nicely,
but don't use too much or it'll drip down the door and leave streaks on
your paint when it rains..  That should help alot.  Also make sure that
all the door stops are adjusted correctly otherwise they'll just bounce
the lock back out.  I think the bentley shows how to adjust that.

As far as closing from the inside, that's what the second handle at the
rear of the door is for (if your bus has it).  You slide the door until
it's almost all the way shut, and then you can just hold on to the back
handle and pull the back of the door in while sliding it closed.  Now,
showing a non-bus passenger to do this is another story :)

later,
Mike
