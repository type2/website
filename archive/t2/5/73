Subject: RE: [T2] First time non-greeting from ACVW

You are definitely not alone. I wave at every VW bus that I see, although
that is not very often in this area (Va). This person could be new to owning
a VW bus and not realize that owning a bus is such a great thing that you
feel like waving to all other bus owners. 

I have only had my bus for about 2 months and when I first drove down the
rode and had some other bus owners hanging out the window waving at me, it
almost scared me. At the time I was still trying to learn how to drive it
and not get blown off the road. Now I am one of those crazed bus owners that
hangs out the window to greet other bus owners :)

Subject: [T2] First time non-greeting from ACVW


Well, it's friday, so I guess I'm alright to ramble here for a spell.  This
past Wednesday, I was cruising down Rt. 68 in Xenia, Ohio in my '66 Camper.
A buddy of mine was driving right behind me in my '83 Vanagon. We were
returning from a rock-climbing trip in Clifton Gorge where we took a bunch
of teen-agers from the YMCA teen camp.  Right outside of town, I see a nice
blue and white bay window coming at me, nice bus.  So, of course I give a
big, nice, friendly wave out the window.  I get NOTHING from the bay window
driver.  I look in my rear-view and my buddy driving the Vanagon does the
same as me, gives a big friendly greeting.  Again, NOTHING from the driver
of the bay window! So, WTF?!?!?  This is the first time EVER that I have
been in my bus and NOT gotten a wave from another passing bus driver.  Here
in Ohio, air cooled buses are few and far between, and when I see another
one on the road I get very excited. It's kinda like being told "Hey, you're
not alone out ther!
!
!
!
!
e!" So, am I the only who feels like this when I see another bus on the
road? Tell me there are more people who do... Oh my God, I'm not a freak am
I!?!?!?  Wait a minute, don't answer that last question....
