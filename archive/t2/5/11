Justin,

Are you sure the engine in your '78 is shot? I've seen more than one bug/bus
for sale that supposedly doesn't run - but only have a minor problem.

Also, even if the engine has valve/compression problems and assuming that
the engine did not have a catastrophic failure (like a broken valve, smashed
piston, bend rod, etc) is is very likely that the lower end
(case/crank/rods) is perfectly functional. The lower end of the 2L engine is
very robust.

Check it out in detail before assuming you need a rebuild. Also if the FI is
on it, don't assume it's more than you can deal with. The FI system can be
overwhelming if an intermittent problem exists, but it is worth keeping if
you're willing to invest some time learning about it. This list and the
people on it are a GREAT FI resource.

Good luck!
