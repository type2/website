If the distributor drive pinion is in properly, when #1 is in firing
position the business end of the rotor in the distributor should point in
the general direction of the crank pulley. If you get it in 180 degrees
backwards, the business end of the pinion will point at #3 cylinder.

IMO, and people will disagree with this, I don't think the engine really
cares as long as you can crank the whole distributor around to match. I put
my distributor drive in 180 degrees backwards, installed the distributor
with the traditional #1 cylinder notch pointed the same way, and it doesn't
know the difference. Switching wires around on the distributor, now, that's
a different story.
