Subject: Volksfest in Ohio, anyone camping?

Howdy all!
Just wanted to see who was going to the Central Ohio Vinatge Volkswagen Club's Volkfest show this Saturday Aug 11 in Columbus Ohio, and also wanted to see if there is a place where the bus folks will be camping near-by.  I live pretty close and would love to hook up with some fellow bussers for a little campground throw down.
