Subject: Re: [T2] Electric fuel pump safety 

Jamie,  that is exactly the wire I used for the electric fuel pump I put in 
the '73.  The write-up should be in the files.  If not, I think I saved it 
somewhere on my hard drive.  The only time the fuel pump gets power is when 
the alternator is spinning fast enough to flow 12 volts thru that blue wire.  
I used the one that was connected to the aux blower, but that was just for 
ease... it might have been a neater installation if it was taken off the 
correct terminal.
If you have empty bowls on the carbs, you will need to temporarily put 12 
volts directly to the pump to get them full, but then you can shut the engine 
off and reconnect correctly.
If ya need more details, let me know and I will find the exact write-up with 
the part number of the relay that I used and where/what I connected to each 
terminal.
