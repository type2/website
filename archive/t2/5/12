Subject: Electric fuel pump safety 

I was wondering about the installation of an electric fuel pump in a  73 Bus
that previously had a mechanical pump..

Specifically connecting  the pump relay to the same power point that the blower
fan in the engine bay gets power from

This relay needs a ground and the alternator MUST have a voltage output to
operate,, so this would be a great way to make sure the fuel pump does not run
if the engine was not  as in an accident where the fuel line is ruptured after
the pump and the key is still in the on position

This wire is the blue wire that goes to the "A" terminal on the fan relay,, it
also goes to the dash light and dual circuit brake warning light


Am I correct with that wire?,,, I was sure I was , but I was recently perplexed 

Can anyone that has done this please respond

Dave Russell.. are you listening?
