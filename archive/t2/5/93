I was thinking about this too.  I already experimented with a 2" duct 
feeding the carb up the vent column and then I thought I could seal off the 
fan's openning with a shallow cone and feed it with your 6" duct up the 
other vent column.  Some might argue that if VW didn't do it why should I.  
Would that be enough volume of air for a stock 1600 DP with a 30/31 carb and 
stock exhaust?
