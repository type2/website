Bryan:

As of now, there are only two ways to do this.  One is to buy front beam adjusters and weld them in, for which you'd need a TIG welder (preferably), or just buy an assembled adjustable front beam from Bus Boys.  DO NOT remove leaves, it's potentially very dangerous, not to mention it'll give you crappy ride quality.

Dropped spindles would be a great choice, but nobody makes them.  Wolfgang International has supposedly made a prototype, but has no immediate plans on selling this as a product.  Steve at Wolfgang wouldn't go into details about why not, but says they may be available in the future.  I know a couple list members have asked him about the dropped spindles, maybe if more people ask it'll motivate him to finish developing these things and put them on the market.

One thing to consider between dropped spindles and an adjustable beam - Dropped spindles will give you better ride quality, but are not height adjustable.  After thinking about this for a long time, I'm leaning toward using an adjustable beam so I can raise my bus if I take it off road.
