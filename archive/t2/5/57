I went through this last year when I had my 67 beetle totalled by a ford
4x4.  I didn't give the claims adjuster the chance to offend me with his
first estimate.  I was there with him when he took the pix and looked the
car over.  I really talked him up, good ole boy style.  I showed him all to
good points to the car (new rubber, recent engine rebuild, new carb, fresh
interior, no rust holes, good paint) and I had receipts to back up my claims
on the newer engine etc.  He wound up giving me 2700 for the car and they
let me buy it back for about 500. I sold the motor for $500 and parted the
rest out for another $500 or so.  I basically broke even after all the
hustling but if you don't advocate for your self you'll get screwed.
good luck,
