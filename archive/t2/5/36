Subject: more newbie questions, and a lot of them

hey all,

After years of working on bugs, I have become a better man with the recent 
purchase of a '75 Westy.  Although familiar with VDubs in general, I need a 
little help with the idiosyncrasies of the type IV-powered Bay Window.  I 
might as well get this all over with in one go....

-originally purchased in Germany, shipped to US later
-disc brakes in front, manually adjusted drums in rear
-manual transmission


1)  The "engine":

a. The makings for a longblock came in boxes, but it's shot.  I'm thinking 
I'll buy a rebuilt longblock, perhaps a 2 liter.  Any advice on sources?  (I 
have a few picked out.)  How do 17/18/2000 blocks, lifters (hydraulic vs. 
mech), clutch/flywheels, etc. vary? IOW, what do I need to pay attention to 
in order to make sure it fits my setup?

b. I'm thinking I'll get a single weber progressive carb (see 1d).  Can I 
use a FI block (2liter) with an electric pump (one of those low pressure 
ones to replace a mechanical pump) or do I need a block that is set up for a 
mechanical pump?  Does this single carb work ok with the brake servo and a 
stock (vacuum advance) distributor?

c.I need to find a *complete* set of cooling tins (incl. fan shroud) as well 
as a complete exhaust system.  what's the best way to make sure I have 
everything, and the right parts for my application?  (I don't need new, just 
operational)

d.I'm getting a nervous tic from just looking at all the wires dangling in 
my engine compartment.  Am I better off (whatever that means) isolating 
auxiliary stuff (lights, instruments, etc) and starting from scratch with 
engine electrics (tearing out all that factory-diagnosis and FI stuff) or 
trying to repair what I have?  Does that question even make sense?


2) brakes/bearings

a. Both Bentley and Haynes say to unbolt the e-brake cable bracket from the 
rear [brake] backing plate to remove it.  There's no bolt (as there is on a 
bug); rather it looks pressed in.  Can I bend the shoulder on the bracket, 
shove it out, and still reinstall it when I'm done?

b. This isn't unique to a bus, but I'm still curious:  what should I use as 
a drift for my bearings?  Should I hammer or press (I could do either)?  I 
plan to replace them all anyway.


3) camper interior

a. I'd like to run a fridge, both when I'm driving and when I'm stopped.  
Should I get a regular dorm fridge and a 12v DC to 120v AC adaptor, or 
should I get one of those 12v DC fridges (you can get them at truck stops) 
and a 120v AC to 12v DC adaptor for when I'm stopped?  Or should I find a 
later Westy fridge and retro-fit?  I would like to run just one battery with 
a high-amp alternator (see 1d).


Thank you for reading this far!  Some friends and I are trying to get ready 
for a LONG road trip next summer (hence the bug wasn't enough).  If you make 
some friends and help us get on our way, we just might happen to be in your 
area with frosty beverages and willing VW hands if you need either next 
summer....

TIA for help on any topic,
Ben
