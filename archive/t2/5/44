I understand your philosophy here, and I would certainly go the same way
if I was caught on the road with a shot CV.

I feel your pain!  My local VWFLAPS seems to be pretty good.  The
counterman knew the jumper bodge to make a common VW 5-terminal headlight
relay work like the unobtanium 4-terminal relay.  When I asked him about
the brand and origin of the last CV boots I bought (on the phone) he said,
"Don't worry, they're German.  I don't stock the Taiwan junk"  Since it
seems that he knows my concerns even before I ask, I'd say that the shop
is competent.  He said that the rebuilt axles get new balls and cages, as
these are the parts most likely to be bad.  However, the balls are not
matched to the individual CVs as they supposedly are on new Lobro CVs.

So true.  I can think of one shop in the San Fernando Valley that I
wouldn't set foot in.  Lotsa shiny chrome Taiwan tin that doesn't come
close to fitting.  Fool me once...

Your report will be interesting.  I have little use for "lifetime
warranties" as the real cost in CV replacement is the labor.  When I hear
of folks who are happy because they are on their fourth starter on a
"lifetime warranty" deal I wonder if they are counting the time and hassle
of removing and replacing the starter, being stranded, etc. in their cost
savings over a new Bosch part.

NAPA is a savior in small town America.  The prices are a bit steep, but
when you need a particular part in the boonies.
