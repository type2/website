...I looked under the hood of the bus...

It's a decklid!

....tell me where i could get a new seal for the sunroof?...

Wecome to bus ownership, we're glad to have you. There are many fantastic
suppliers and technical people contributing to this site daily. I would deal
with them first (i.e.: Bus Depot, BUSted VW, etc...) They will make
themselves known.

Good luck, save your bread for the mechanical stuff first!
