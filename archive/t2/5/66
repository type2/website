Actually, those pumps put out over 60 lbs, which is controlled by the
regulator to a running pressure of 28-32 lbs. Your looking for nothing but
problems to use other than Bosch parts in a Bosch system. Why are those
pumps so expensive??? That's what it takes to make a pump that will last
15-20 years. I have seen generic pumps used a few times. In every case they
were VERY noisy and the fuel and lines carry that noise throughout the
system. Any noise other than a very subdued hum from a Bosch pump means it
will probably fail soon. Sometimes, it's just a clogged filter that make
the pump work very hard and brings on their demise.

I would try a used Bosch pump from the salvage yard before trying something
else if I couldn't afford to fix it right with a new pump. Odds are it will
work long enough to sell the Bus to the unsuspecting, or just might outlast
a new wannabe pump.

Know also that your conversion to FI on an original carbed chassis will
require plumbing a return fuel line to the tank, or replacement of the tank
with a FI tank. The time/money to do that right could well exceed the cost
of a new Bosch pump.

An FI 2.0 liter is a very good way to go and probably worth the effort.
Probably the easiest way to pick up some extra horse power without
diminishing longevity. However, just putting FI on the 1.7, 1.8 carbed
engine could get a bit problematic. No provision for a temp sensor mount,
ECU mount, pressure regulator mount, air filter mount, yadayadayada. Be
prepared to spend time/money getting all this fit up.
