Subject: Deluxe Transporter description

hello again list!

i have seen lots of talk before that defines the differences between
a Deluxe & standard camper, but I have no information on what made my
72 bus a "Deluxe" Transporter.

here's what little i know so far:

1) chrome body molding
2) chrome strip around front grill

can anyone provide me with any other info regarding 
what makes a Deluxe model a Deluxe?

TIA!
