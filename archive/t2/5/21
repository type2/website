Hi Mike,

I would suggest that you take a look at the three sliding door tracks.

My previous bus ('73) had a difficult sliding door and when I looked at the three tracks they were all bunged up at the 'door closed' end with dirty, dried up grease; poke gently with a screw driver to remove the grease then apply a coating of new clean grease.

Top and bottom tracks are easy to do, but for the middle track you will have to remove the cover; but that's not very difficult and there's lots in the archive on how to do it.

Good luck
