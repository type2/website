Well don't worry - the wire is a short one. Remove the wood headliner if 
you've got one - takes about 20 minutes (remove mirror, sunvisors, screws). 
You wouldn't have to do this but it would make it easier.

You'll find that the wire runs in the trough between the roof and the top 
of the door frame. Then it curves and falls down through the A-post (the 
metal post between the windshield and door opening). It comes out through a 
hole shared with the wire from the door switch and then runs to the fuse box.

I believe it is hot all the time and the door switch controls the ground.

The run is easy and smooth but you may want to remove the cot bracket on 
the A-post if the wire gets caught on the ends of the screws inside the 
A-post.

I would just use fairly stiff wire and feed it from the top.

Typical automotive wire (as already found in the vehicle) works but is 
pretty floppy. Replacement wire (ala FLAPS wire) is slightly larger and 
stiffer and easier to feed. Larger wire won't hurt a thing.

Good luck.
