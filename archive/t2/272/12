Subject: Re: [T2] (correction) I need this tiny EGR part for an FI bus.

There are no c clips holding the linkage on. Both levers have a pressed-in
nylon insert. The linkage pops into the nylon insert and stays put.

I have not figured out a way to replace the inserts. Trying to remove a good
one from a bad egr valve has destroyed the insert. All I have been able to do
is replace the lever itself with one with a good insert.

EGR lowers NoX [oxides of nitrogen] output. NoX is formed when combustion
temps exceed 2500 F. EGR lowers combustion temp. If your state only requires
two gas testing, HC and CO, you will never know if the EGR system is working
as it should. EGR does not lower NoX much, only about 100. The catalytic
convertor does more lowering.
