Subject: TMI Panel Below Wholesale

Just a note to say that these are available again, as the pending sale
didn't materialize from the last time I posted them.  So I'm re-posting
them. (See below.)  By the way, these are for a "walkthrough" bus, so they
wouldn't work on a crew-cab.

A customer returned a pair of TMI panels that we don't normally stock. I'll
pass them on at below wholesale to the first person who responds, rather
than return them to TMI.

These are the "bulkhead" panels that go behind the front seats in a '68-76
bus (one behind each seat), in their standard beige color ("beige #14 smooth
leather vinyl;" pretty close to stock).  They are brand new. They retail for
$80 and we normally discount them to $60.  Your price will be $39.90 for the
pair (plus shipping).

There is only one pair at this price. Email me directly at ron(-at-)busdepot.com
if you want 'em.
