Some have had a hard time getting to the www.vwtrendsweb.com site, so here's 
the blurb, un-quote: It looks like we're going have a few Bays after all !! 
See you all there -

VW Trends Magazine presents its second annual car cruise. We have again 
teamed up with Wahoo's Fish Taco for some fun in the Southern California 
sun. This year we have added some new partners to help facilitate some stops 
that are ideal for a cruise along the coast. We anticipate some familiar 
faces this year as well as many new ones. So if you missed out last year, 
you won't want to miss the 2002 VW Trends Drive-In Charity Cruise, where we 
will support our friends at the Boys & Girls Club of Santa Ana. For more 
information and registration, please read the following information.
