Subject: Westy kitchen rust holes

Hi volks,
I just picked up my (new to me) 79 Westy and have gutted the interior to
completely rehab it.  I've discovered 2 rust holes in the interior floor
about the size of a quarter in the middle of the floor. (not the normal
drain holes)  It appears that the drain tube from the ice box was
missing and all the water just drained into the floor of the camper and
rotted all the material underneath the carpet!  The bus is currently not
driveable so I'd like to address the holes without having to go to a
body shop.  I don't have welding equipment or skills.

Does anyone have any advice on how to fix these holes without taking out
the entire floor and welding a new one in?  The rest of the floor is
fairly solid with a little surface rust with which I can deal, but these
2 holes have me stumped.  Thanks, Greg
