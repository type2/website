Subject: VW Trends Cruise Oct 19th - Calling All Bays!

Greetings So. Cal. listees -

If you weren't aware of it, now you are. VW Trends is having their Charity 
Cruise this Saturday - see the www.vwtrendsweb.com website for specifics.

Folks... I noticed a spectacular LACK of Bays last run. Let's make this 
event!! We'll have free (as usual) "Save The Bays!" window stickers for all 
Bays in attendance.

I'm sure some of the Turbo Bugs that took back seat to Itch at Irwindale 
will be there too. I need backup! These hot rodders are a tough bunch, and 
maybe we should show them a Tour de Force of what's in stock for the next 
Drag Day event.

See you there -

Mike & Itch / Jim & Pootie
