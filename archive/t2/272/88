If you don't have a milliammeter, as George suggested,, you can use a test
lamp.. 

Take off the ground strap from the battery, and install a 12v lamp between the
battery terminal and the ground,, if the lamp glows bright, you have a large
load, or dead short, 
if the lamp barely glows,, you have a very light load, like the radio preset 
remove fuses , and disconnect things till the light goes out.

MAKE SURE you have the doors closed as the ceiling light will make you think
there is a load, or short.
