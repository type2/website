Subject: Re: [T2] southwind heater pump

The "mistery port" is the return line back to the fuel line, it came off the
"high" side of the pump and would return the fuel instead of putting extra
stress on the actuator inside the fuel pump.

I have NOS factory rebuild manuals that are not listed on my site for $25,
these are in excellent shape, no water stains or any curled pages.

I am the only direct VW SouthWind factory parts rep, so if you need tune up
parts or manuals for any of the VW SouthWinds, go to:

http://pages.prodigy.net/busbarn/southwind.html

I am now working on getting the labels next for all the different models.
