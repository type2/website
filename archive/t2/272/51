Subject: New cd player cuts out

I just installed a new Blaupunkt cd player in my '71 Campmobile. I ran a fused
8 gauge wire from the battery to the cd. Then I hooked the player's ignition /
accessory lead to a connection piggybacked onto the rear-defroster switch.

I popped in my homemade "Beatle George" CD -- all the songs George Harrison
wrote while with the Beatles -- and headed for the beach. All was well.

Until I turned on the turn signal. Then the Blaupunkt lost power for a second
or two and returned to life. Same thing when I press the brakes.

I've hooked the accessory lead to the turn signals, too. No change.

Is this unit just extremely sensitive to slight voltage dips? Or is this a
clue to something ominous lurking in my electrical system?

Thanks in advance for all help.
