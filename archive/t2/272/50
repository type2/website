Subject: TypeIV Thermostat Question

Hi all:

I understand the TypeIV thermostat is generally NLA.  However, there was
discussion on the list that the old upright engine thermostats, which *are*
available, could be substituted with a little judicious modification.

I recently was looking at the on-line catalog for California Imports and
looked up the thermostat for the Beetle engine.  The picture that
accompanied the listing didn't look anything like the TypeIV thermostat and
the text stated "new style design - does not look like the original", which
certainly was true.

Can this thermostat be used in the TypeIV engine with similar modification?
