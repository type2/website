Subject: Re: [T2] New cd player cuts out

Good idea; I'll double-check the ground. If it's not that, I'm wondering if
a small capacitor might work ...

I've been thinking about switching to an alternator, but  I don't think the
cutting out is due to a lack of amps. My headlights are good and bright and
don't dim at all. And this didn't happen with my old cassette deck.
