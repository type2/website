OK that make sence. Which brings up one more quick question. Can these
heaters be hooked up to the existing FI system in my bus w/out any
problem? When I say in the system I mean supply from before the pump &
return after the pressure regulator. Anyone tried this? I know they
put gas heaters on FI systems, just not sure if the tank had extra
hose bibbs or now. thanks rick.
