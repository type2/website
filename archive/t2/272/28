Life has conspired to force me to let some vehicles
go. Including...my '68 bus.
(Nothing terrible, just the ol' slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune...)

He's a home-grown "weekender" with a full width bed
and table.
A dent in the nose and very little rust, blue paint's
faded to hell. Driver window equalizer needs replaced.

Kind folks on the list guided me in putting on a new
muffler, master cylinder & reservoir, and convert to a
Bosch alternator w/voltmeter. And a ton of other
little things.

Runs strong and cool. 

It's in Utah, but I could be talked into a final
un-venture by driving it to you.

P-mail me for more details--i'll spill my guts.
