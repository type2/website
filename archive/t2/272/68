Mine all required a fair amount of pounding, even with the rotor pre-heated
in the oven. The concern would be if the race is loose enough to potentially
spin freely in the hub under load. Is the race seated tightly at room
temperature? You probably have to be the judge...  Keep in mind the hub will
get warm or hot on the highway and after braking.
