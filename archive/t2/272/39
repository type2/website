Subject: Wierd Valve Adjusters

List,
I went to the local VW shop for some valve adjusters, because mine were
hosed.
When I picked up the new ones, they were way too small.  So, I go back, and
it ends up they are watercooled vanagon rocker arms and adjusters.  They
have the bigger 15mm jam nut, and a bigger adjuster.  Is there any benefit
to this setup?  Are the rockers themselves any better?

Thanks,

Simon
