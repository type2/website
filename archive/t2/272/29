Subject: 70 Westy FS in Seattle

There is a 1970 Westy for sale in Seattle for $1500.  It looks to be in ok
shape.  The front is in decent condition and doesn't appear to have been hit
ever.  The rear has been hit at some point and repaired with bondo or adobe or
something.  Camper interior appears complete and it has the pop up tent (i
don't know what condition, the roof was down) and the upper cot.  The yellow
vinyl has a few tears in it, but isn't horrible.  The bus is located on 8th
Ave NW somewhere between 75th and 85th.  The phone number on the sign is
206-387-5777.  I'm assuming it runs as I haven't seen it parked there before.

I don't know who is selling it or anything more than what I've posted here.
