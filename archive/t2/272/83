Subject: RE: [T2] Pertronix point replacement

Blake,
I changed over at least 1 year ago, no problems, improvement on fuel
consumption, 1-2 mpg, easier starting in the morning, but I always keep a
set of points in the box in case the Pertronix fries...

I would use the vendors that frequent this list, www.aircooled.net,
www.busboys.com, www.busdepot.com, etc.  I think there is also CompuFire,
but I've heard they are not as reliable, FWIW.

Later,

I am considering replacing my points with a Pertronix
ignition and a flame thrower coil.
