Dick,

Uhhh....this is a "good" job.

I took mine out of my 78 and installed a new one....took me one weekend to 
get all of the glueable pieces in and cut correctly.

The rest of the next week to figure out that the parts that you hange the 
bows in were not correct(an apparently *not* correct on *any* of the 
replacements).  Another part of the week to take the old and new head
liner to an upholstery shop and the get the bow hangers corrected.

Another weekend to hang it and try and figure out which way to stretch it
first and then get the wrinkles out of it.  Then decide whether to work 
front to back or back to front..

Almost finished now!...If i can get the %^&*!)_$)(!(-at-))(((-at-)*# center
sliding windows in.  :-((((


Cheers, dave
