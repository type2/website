Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends Cruise Oct 19th - Calling All Bays!

I intend to be there with the Bluegrass Breadloaf ('73 Panel, white over
blue for those other that Mike and Jim who don't know).  

Mike, you're reading my mind, and I feel sorry for you! ha.   I was just
thinking this morning about putting out a note on the cruise.  My son,
Chris and I attended last years inaugural event and had a ball.  This
year he said he was going to drive his '72 Super Beetle, thank you!  My
bluegrass music drives metal heads like him crazy!  But that got foiled
too.  He go the dates mixed up and took Sunday instead of Saturday off
of work.  Oh well.

Yes, I'll see you there,  Anybody else?
