Count me and Speedy in!  I'm planning on being there with the whole famn
damily!  Look for the Savannah Beige and White Bay with 'Bad Dog Racing'
across the front.  I'm saving room for my 'Save The Bays' decal.

If for anything else, the cruise is for charity, AND the driver gets a
t-shirt.  Can't go wrong there...

Later,

I intend to be there with the Bluegrass Breadloaf ('73 Panel, white over
blue for those other that Mike and Jim who don't know).
