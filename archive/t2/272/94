David,

This is exactly what a vacuum/mechanical distributor for a late bus is
supposed to do.  Everything is fine :-)  Actually, if it didn't rotate,
that would be a bad sign.  what you are feeling is the mechanical advance
in the base of the can.  You should be able to turn it in one direction,
and it ought to spring back of its own accord.  Check?  To keep this
functioning correctly, put a couple drops of oil on the felt pad in the
center of the shaft. (Oh, and, yes, it will have an effect on timing (it's
supposed to :-))
