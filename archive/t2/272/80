I'm looking for a pair of the heat riser covers and the heat riser cover
gaskets that mate up with the Pulley cover tin.  I'm still getting some
exhaust fumes into the heat and am trying to just get the engine compartment
completely sealed.  Does anyone have a set they'd part with or have a source
for where to get them? This is for a 1600 DP engine.

Also, how does one remove the rear view mirror from a 71 bus?

Thanks,

Hal Landvoigt
