Subject: A Front Wheel Bearings Question

Hi all:

Recently got some new rotors and new front bearings.  Today I installed the
races for the bearings in the hubs.  Although I've never done this before I
heated the rotors in the oven, to about 300-350 degrees, before installing
the races.

Three of the four races went in pretty much as I expected; after 5 or so
minutes of going 'round and 'round and gentle tap, tap, taping with my tack
hammer the races were home.  However, one race, a large inside race, dropped
into place in the hot hub!  That is, I lined it up in its hole, let go of
the race expecting it would settle a millimeter or less, and it fell until
it was seated!

The race seems secure enough in the cooled off hub, but I wonder if this
presages problems down the line.  Anybody have in experience in this regard?

Thanks!
