Richard,

Wondered the same thing myself....

#1  I suspect that the voltage involved would *never* be able to
	turn the resistance wire hot before it broke...if even that.

#2  Same reason that oil tankers don't blow up....the air/volatile mixture 
	inside	the oil chambers is kept deliberately "rich"....not enough air and 
	it won't explode...

You obviously did not experiment enough with volatile liquids as a 
child....I still have a couple of scars from "experiments" of that nature.

LOL... what we make it thru as kids!


Cheers, dave
