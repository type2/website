Subject: Re: [T2] (correction) I need this tiny EGR part for an FI bus.

From what I understand the EGR system actually makes emissions worse.
Just purchased a new EGR valve so I could pass smog.  Big waste of $230.
I wish I had spend the time to find a smog shop that would glance over the
visual.  My local VW shop and my smog shop told me the EGR was a joke.

Can anybody confirm that the EGR system actually lowers emissions?  Test
on a smog anaylizer?
