Subject: 72 Camper For Sale

I have a 72 Camper that is sitting in a field I would like to get rid of.
The bus is complete minus front turn signals and the icebox.  It has some
minor cancer holes but nothing too extreme.  It was parked six years ago.  I
was told that it was driven to where it now is camped.  It is not a Westy.
The Camper conversion was done by an American company.(Winnabago?)  Please
don't get me wrong, this bus is rough but not so far gone it can not be
repaired.  If you want a project bus or just parts come haul it away for
$500.00USD.  I live in central PA.  You can reach me here via email or at
717.362.3006.  My 82 Vanagon keeps me busy and I don't have time for this
one.  Come give it a good home.
