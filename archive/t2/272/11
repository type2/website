Subject: cleaning westy upholstery

Hey folks, I just wanted to share a tip I learned this weekend cleaning the 
upholstery in my new used westy.

I've now cleaned everything except the front seats and I will reupholster 
them with fabric found in an identical 78 westy in a local junkyard.  My 
camper still has the original plaid fabric which was filthy with grease and 
dog hair.

I pulled out all the draperies (which weren't that dirty) and pulled all 
the upholstery off the z-bed and the zippered cushions.  The Z-bed was 
pretty easy, it all comes off by pulling out a few staples.  It will be 
easy to put back on.   I sprayed everything down with "Shout" stain 
remover, let it stand for about 5 minutes and then put it all in the 
washing machine in cold water and "Gain".  I ran the washing machine 2-3 
times until the rinse water ran clear.
I let it air dry, since I thought the dryer might shrink the material.

All upholstery came out looking brand new!!!  It is amazing, even all the 
grease stains are gone.  The yellow stripes in the plaid are now very 
bright. The few sun fade spots on the draperies will be fixed with fabric 
paint.  All in all, a very inexpensive way to spiff up the interior!  Greg
