Subject: Kristin Laurite article in Dallas Morning News

Volks,

Today there was a large article in the Dallas Morning News about the murder of Kristin Laurite at an Arkansas rest stop on Aug. 25, 2000.  Even included a picture of her bus.  If you want more information you can go to http://www.kristinlaurite.org/.  I also think you can access this article online through http://www.dallasnews.com but they will make you register (free, but lots of questions) before you can see it.  It is in the "Texas and SouthWest" section of today's paper (Tuesday, October 15th 2002).  Many people are still actively trying to solve this case - let's not forget about it here on the list.
