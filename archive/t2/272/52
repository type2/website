DING! DING! DING! We have a winner!!!!  Yes, gasoline and air are only
flammable over a fairly limited range of mixtures.  This is where "lean"
and "flooded" come from.  There just is not enough oxygen inside a gas
tank for flame to get a grip.  It is essentially in a "flooded" condition
full time.  At the same time, take out 99% of the gasoline, put in air,
add a spark (from a torch, say) and you can get an impressive explosion!

As a side note, the range of mixtures varies signifficantly depending on
fuel.  The gas/air range is narrow, the alcohol/air range is wider, the
ether/air range is *much* wider!

I tend to think of it as "chlorine for the gene pool" :-)
