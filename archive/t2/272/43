Subject: Re: Dome Light

On this thread -- I recently had to replace the dome light wire on a 65 beetle convertible.   Dome light over rearview and you have to fish around the 
corner at the top of the windshield pillar (no direct access to top opening on pillar).

Had no luck getting a variety of wires to make it through because they kept binding around that 90 degree bend.  Finally recalled hearing about using 
string and compressed air.  I knotted the end of some string and was able to blow it far enough thru with compressed air that I could snag it with a 
wire from below.  Cool.

HTH,
