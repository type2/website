Subject: 72 Westy trouble...

OK guru's, I received this AIRS inquiry this morning. I'm 160 miles away
from Port Aransas, Texas and am wondering if any listees know a
reputable VW mechanic in the Port A/ Corpus Christie area to help out
this new VW owner. I know nothing about the Westy in question other than
what is copied below. Ideas anyone? You can respond directly to me and
cc Kathy in Port Aransas.

Let's see if we can help.

Thanks

I am in Port Aransas, and need help. No emergency, have had my bus one
week, and lost oil pressure the first time I got it
out on the highway. Lost power, and oil light came on. Had plenty of
oil, and none came out. It still starts, but I had it
towed home. No one here will mess with it. I'm soooooooo sad! Any help
at all would be appreciated. I know nothing
about vw's. Thanks, Kathy. Please respond to katfish0077(-at-)yahoo.com
