Subject: re:[T2] Floor panel patch 

i dont know what you have access to but, i keep an old hood in the back of my 
garage for reasons like this. I just cut off the size piece i need and viola! 
.. hope this gives you an idea or two. good luck.. and dont be afraid of the 
welder, it doesnt take a pro to do patch work on a floor, if you get an old 
hood, practice on that... well good luck .. peace .. scott 71 vesty
