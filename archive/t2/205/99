Subject: [T2] Exhaust questions...

Ok so I just bought a 73 passenger bus from an auto mechanic.  He says it 
needs more exhaust pieces.  The PO didnt want to fix the bus so he left it 
there and dropped off the title, I picked it up for $200.  The only known 
problem is the lack of exhaust(nothing is currently attached to the bus, all 
in the trunk compartment).  It has the heat echangers, muffler, and tail 
pipe...does it need anything else or is does this mechanic just not know 
anything about busses.  He personaly owns several corvair vans so I would 
assume he knows whats up but I just wanted to double check with the list. If 
anyone could help me out that would be great.

Thanks.
Brennan.
