Subject: fuel filler pipe

Ok, I am stuck.  I am pulling the fuel filler pipe to replace leaking hoses.
I have the firewall & the round access panel off.  I have the pipe
disconnected from the side of the bus & the tank.  How do I get it out of
the bus?  I can't figure out how to get it out.  I have the tank loose but
not out.  It did no good.  Help.  I need to fix this today.
