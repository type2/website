Subject: Re: [T2] one motor, two buses

Bill - are you in mystic Ct?, If so, you've given me valuable help in more
than one
post before.  But what's next for me is to take the smooth running 1600 out
of a lovingly cared for 71 camper that I drive around everywhere during the
summers, and transplant it into a 65 *project* that I've spent a year and a
half grinding, sanding, bleeding, fuse blowing, and swearing/smiling at,
just to see if it works, and how it feels.  I pulled an oil drenched1600
TIII motor with a full flow oil *filder*, funky dune buggy type exhaust,
dual carbs, all chrome engine tin,  running at 82, 85, 82, 110, out of the
65, while it was still running.  I was left with a cracked case and head,
rusted out manifolds, etc, basket case of an engine.  So... in the meantime,

while the earth rotates and I save the money to rebuild it, I was simply
wondering if swapping engines for One or Two, or if necessary, maybe even
Three (Sorry, my brother in law Chuck, and I have a little joke about couple

two tree) years, would be feasible.  Just by the honks and waves I've been
getting while working on it in my driveway during the last two weeks, I
would love to get it out on the road.  BTW, I live on less than 1/4 acre on
a state road one mile from New Haven with five cars(65 is hidden in the back

of the garage and rolled out).  Stockade fences.  The only reason I don't
have six, is I can't find a splittie single cab someone is giving away for
free :)
