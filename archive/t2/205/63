Subject: green mountains defeat bus

Hi all
Just got back from a vacation in Vermont.  I was a very bad boy and
abused my wife's bus.  We made it home but the bus is hurt.  I was
trying to go east to west in vermont which is a difficult thing to do.
  I took a road on the map that ended up being about a vertical climb.  I
downshifted into second and then to first then the bus started making a
loud clanking noise.  I had to go further up to find a place to turn
around and go back down hill.  Since then  on the way home, if we hit a
step upgrade we can feel the bus buck.  One very steep upgrade we heard
the noise, only less.  But driving on a level road everything seems to
sound fine.  Also if I rev the engine it sounds fine.  I also tied to
run the car in gear with the break on to put a load on it and I didn't
get the noise.  I hope I didn't damage a main bearing.  I was thinking a
transmission mount but I see that it only has a cradle.  Other then that
is there some main bearing in the transmission.  Any ideas?
