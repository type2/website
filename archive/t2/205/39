Of course.

But what about shrouding?  Larger valves leave less room for the A/F charge 
to go around the valve into the cylinder.  My point is just that cylinder 
head design is very tricky business.  I think too many people assume that 
bigger is always better and fail to realize that there is a point of 
dimishing returns.  Who really knows where that point is?

I agree with you, but I'm not sure what part you're referring to.  Do you 
mean that the larger valve stem is more aerodynamic than the smaller valve 
stem?

I have heard more than one person now say it is identical to the stock 
1.7/1.8 cam.  I've also heard that the 2.0 cam is very mild.  I wonder how 
a bus 2.0 with the 1.7/1.8 mechanical cam would run?  Anyone have this 
combination?

That's what I'm after as well.  I don't want to turn more than 5k rpm or 
have a really radical cam that requires stiffer valve springs.  The cam has 
enough problems with premature wear as it is.  Now what I would REALLY like 
is a roller valvetrain conversion - anyone have any ideas?  :)
