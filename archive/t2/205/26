In this ever changing world of What Next?
I must ask; What Next?
I've had my engine and tranny out of my 83 Westy Air Cooled about four
times in seven years with the most recent R&R of July last year when I
installed one of my rebuilt engines.
As the word rotated in normal fashion I acquired an extra engine and
transmission and promptly set off to perform the ultimate rebuild on both
the engine and spare tranny, with the intent of swapping the fresh engine
into the 83 Westy to check out some of my rebuilding tricks and prove
that there are cool running Air Cooled engines and that an extra 10 to 15
horsepower is available if the engine is properly blueprinted.
Having done the R&R routine several times I know its going to take at
least ten hours to perform the swap and get everything back to normal.
Then there is a two week wait to get the grease out from under your
fingernails and a full two to five thousand miles to get the engine break
in completed before any serious travel can be undertaken.
In my neighborhood the City will tow any vehicle that is on your property
or at the curb if it stays un-registered for more than 30 days. (they
only need someone to file a compliant over the phone.) Cars hidden in a
garage don't fall under this rule.
I'd think that while you're waiting for your *two tree years* you might
just get six hundred dollars together and buy another engine.
