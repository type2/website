Subject: Re: [T2] pop top add on

I suggest that if you want to add a pop top, get a bus with a sun roof. My 70 
pop top westy is a sunroof camper and there is no mods for the camper to the 
structure. This is the early bay window camper with the hinge at the front. 
It is great, but only has a single bed/cot in the roof.
