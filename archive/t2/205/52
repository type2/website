My '78 will rattle a bit and the oil pressure light stays on and gauge will 
not register pressure for about 5 seconds when I start it.  You can hear 
things quiet down back there and then the light goes out and the gauge 
registers.  The bus holds good oil pressure once it is running.
It is getting to where I wince every time I turn the key.
I am using Mann filters from Bus Depot and Castrol Syntec oil.
I thought that german OE filters had some sort of pressure valve in them that 
US filters lacked, supposedly to prevent something like this.  Could I have 
gotten a bad batch of filters?  Or is the alleged valve there for some other 
reason?
Also, what is the best way to add an oil cooler?
