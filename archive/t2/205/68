Ahh--here's what the fitlter valve is really for Bob--
The one way valve in  the oil filter prevents the oil from being
scavenged out of the filter when the engine is shut down---it has zip to
do with the filter being loaded up with Ca Ca.

There is a filter by pass valve prior to the filter that will do just
what it's name implies, if in fact the filter is plugged.

Later,

Terry

the valve is for another reason. if the filter gets REAL dirty it won't
starve the engine for oil. as long as the presure pumps up and stays up
you should be fine. synthetic stays on the engine parts better when off
so there is less stress when first starting (or so they say) because the
parts still retain some lube.
