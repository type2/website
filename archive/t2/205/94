Subject: Brake conversion (emergency brake, vacuum ?s)

Hello all!

It's been some time since I posted here so I'll give a very brief rundown on
my setup... I have a 1970 that the PO pulled some weird tricks on so my
rehabilitation efforts have largely been trying to reverse (or complete) his
projects.  Right now I'm (finally!) finishing a front disc conversion.  The
PO had put discs on (actually a complete front end) but that's it - no
servo, no new master, no vacuum line, nada.  I've put the servo on, the
vacuum line, the regulator (make sure it's mounted parallel to line of
travel!), new filler etc. , but have run into two small problems that I
haven't been able to find a solution to in the archives.  The first is thus:
when the servo is installed I find that my emergency brake cable now rubs
against the top of the servo housing.  In a bus with discs is this cable
routed a different way?  Should I try to reroute it or just build a little
bracket to keep it off the servo?  I know it doesn't rub much so there's
very little concern for busting it...  My other question is about the rubber
boot on the end of the servo.  There appears to be another vacuum line
hookup there.  Is this opening just to vent the system? Or should it be
routed into the other line?

Thanks in advance for any help!
