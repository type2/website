Subject: RE: [VB] Tightening torque - small cylinder studs

I am suspect of the accuracy of 10-150 ft-lb range wrenches in the lower
end of their range.  I plan to get a lighter wrench that will be more
accurate in this range.

George,
you are right about getting the smaller range wrench for the accuracy. When
I read, and then re-read your post I thought to myself, "here is a guy
destined to write for Mother Earth News" ! Muir would be proud of your down
to earth practical ways of doing things for the backyard builder. Keep it up
!

By the way, For the lower end accuracy check, I use a double ended 3/8 to
3/8 or 1/2 to 1/2 female to female square end adapter from Proto to connect
the suspect wrench to a know accurate one, clamping the suspect in a similar
manner as yours, and applying slow pressure to the known good wrench until
the suspect reads ok at the click/graph/dial indicator reading when the
known good one does.

Thanks for your input, I, like lots of others welcome it.
