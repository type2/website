Subject: newbie question re:  buying 1975 T2

Greetings All -

I am considering buying my first bus!  I used to own an 84 westy and
worked on it quite a bit.  I like the simplicity of a bus I have seen for
sale around my neck of woods (Arcata, CA). 

This bus I am considering is a 1975 1800cc non-camper.  I have not driven
it or received call back from the owner.  I'd like some practical tips on
how to assess its condition and worth.  

Here's what the sticker says:

4,000 miles on totally rebuilt motor
Fuel Injected
New Clutch and brakes

The body looks pretty good.  Rust is limited to the seams.  A few minor
dents, not bad.  

I would like to find out why they're selling it.  I would like it to be
my daily driver for a bit.  It looks like the rear seat folds into a bed,
which would be great since I'll be sleeping in it 2-3 days per week.  No
curtains.  Can I install them?  It's a very clean, basic looking van. 
What should i check for underneath?

Asking price is $1,700

Thanks in advance!

Les
