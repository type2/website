Subject: RE: [T2] oil temp sendor Q

It may look like solid brass (I assume brass) but I assure it is not. I
haven't seen that one before but usually those solid looking gauge
sending units are thicker than sheet metal but not by much. Inside is
the variable resistance element that is used to sense temperature. You
won't know how thick it is until it's too late.

I'm planning to add oil temp sensing and since my case is a universal
one I will use the T3 filler block off plate to mount the sensor. That
plate is below the oil level so I'll get a good reading and the sending
unit won't hang below the engine. I don't know if your sensor would fit
or if you have this type of case but maybe this is an option.
