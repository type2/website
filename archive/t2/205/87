http://www.oregoncountryfair.com  - see now, i washed my car this morning,
real good washing, for the first time on this DC and i testify here and now
that it felt significantly much more aerodynamic.  and i saw faeries
(still a bus report)...  o LOT o great buspeoples down with keeping them
alive as vitals machines for the road. all moving and well.  some n'westers
might be saying, oh that's obvious ~ country fair! but it is one of the
best bus crowds anywhere ever. i picked  up a free sticker from the
xtracycle.com booth: "God, grant me the courage to sell my CAR". that'd be
a tall, tall order of courage.
