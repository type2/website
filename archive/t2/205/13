I can vouch for probable loose axle nut.  in one case on a type one some 
idiot for got to torque the nut after lowering the vehicle back  to the 
ground (might have been me). and on another a non vw maint shop did a 
road quick fix for me.  lost that drum just as i was pulling into the 
driveway.  every case i have seen of ripped out splines, i am suspicious 
of the torque on the nut.
