Subject: [VB] one motor, two buses


Any of you multiple bus owners out there use one motor for more than one
bus?  I'm planning on putting the 1600dp rebuilt 7,000 miles ago into
the 65 to get it registered. I then came on the idea that maybe for a
couple two tree years, I would swap the motor and drive the other bus.
Odd years splittie, even bay, etc.  I would only be driving them
May-Oct, putting about 4,000 miles a year.  Maybe do the same with
wheels too?  It would definitely give me something to look forward to,
and maybe each bus would last twice as long :) But is it feasible?

Just a thought,

Don,
Back when I was a little more poorer than now and we had to go through
emissions testing for our year vehicles, I would take a stock engine off the
shelf and load it up in the bug/bus/truck and get it professionally tuned at
the VW garage and get the bug/bus/truck through emissions and get the tabs.
I would then pull the engine, put in the engine I wanted in there, and put
the tuned engine in one of the other cars for testing or back on the shelf.
Sounds unethical, I know, but it torques me off when we are forced to test
and tune, (at our great expense), newer cars to get our tabs, and older cars
can run around belching tons of pollutants without a second glance. Either
make it one way for everyone or not at all.
