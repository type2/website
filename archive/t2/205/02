Subject: 78"  body part question

hello all,

i'm restoring my 78 bus and i'm running into a wall in trying to locate 
a body part for the front end. the frontend is pretty smashed up on this 
van so i'm chopping it off and replacing from the nose panel down. the 
bumper mounts on what should be the outer front lower nose panel, but 
the panel on my van protrudes out about 6 or 8 inches and looks like 
it's part of the bumper assemble. i've been unable to locate this part.

does anyone know where i can locate this panel from my van? i have a 
picture of the front end of the van which i can email to anyone who'd 
like to see what i'm talking about. i'm not even sure what to call it 
exactly.

thanks
darin
