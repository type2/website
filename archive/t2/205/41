Amen.

No, not the stem itself, but where the stem tapers or flares into the
valve head itself is known to be a major point of potential turbulence.
I seem to recall that the 2.0 sodium filled valves had a different angle
of flare, though whether it was steeper or more shallow escapes me.
Also, and this is just speculation, given consistency of design between
two heads where the only diffence is one of scale--meaning larger valves
and stems but also larger passages and ports surrounding them and
passing mixture into the chambers--I strongly suspect proportional
turbulence through the ports.

They were available! At least back then they were, because I actually
considered them but gave it up because they were <very> expensive, like
around 300.00, if memory serves. I don't think it was Scat, but someone
was cutting them on a CNC. They were billit aluminum, very squared off
and bulldog looking and beautiful, almost too good to cover in oil and
hide under a valve cover.
