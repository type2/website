Pat,

When I did my 78, I had the gas tank out.

I am asuming that you are talking about the tank to metal filler pipe 
hose? and not the filler to body hose?

Put all of the filler pipe pretty much together and lubed
up the inside of the rubber hose.  Hold on to the metal part
thru the round access hole and reach around with the other hand and
rotate the hose going on to the tank while pulling it toward the tank.


Put the tank end on first..once it is fairly secure then rotate correctly 
for the body to metal filler hose.  Gently pull the body part of the hose 
from the outside untill you get it pulled back thru enough to secure
with the round metal plate.

Hope I really understood the problem!

Cheers ,dave
