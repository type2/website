I've had my engine and tranny out of my 83 Westy Air Cooled about four
times in seven years with the most recent R&R of July last year when I
installed one of my rebuilt engines.
As the word rotated in normal fashion I acquired an extra engine and
transmission and promptly set off to perform the ultimate rebuild on both
the engine and spare tranny, with the intent of swapping the fresh engine
into the 83 Westy to check out some of my rebuilding tricks and prove
that there are cool running Air Cooled engines and that an extra 10 to 15
horsepower is available if the engine is properly blueprinted.

Bill, was your westy a 1900 water-cooled? Sounds like my old Vanagan. 83 was
a weird year. They had a 215mm flywheel instead of a 228mm and the front
wheel spindles were an odd size and I had to change to 84. When I rebuilt
the engine I noticed a lot of electrolysis eating away on the head surfaces
and so I added grounds to each head from the block. Was  a great little
camper going back and forth from Seattle to Salt Lake and Wyoming.
