Richard,

As Jack mentions below, there was originally a metal pinch-clamp on the
small end of the original boot.  These clamps are wonderful, but you have
to have the proprietary tool (or be *very* lucky with a vice grip) to
apply them.  As the Forza article Jack metions says, a zip-tie works fine
here and that is what I usually use, if I use anything.  The real secret,
as the Forza article also mentions seems to be not to overpack the CV.

The dished washer was deleted early on by VW and Bentley mentions not to
reinstall it even on early ones.  That said, I have gotten these in new CV
joints.  I do not install them because (a) VW says not to and (b) them
make getting the circlip on a real <euphemism> job </euphemism> as you
have to force the CV onto the half shaft as you apply the circlip.  These
days, with the 3/4" drive sockets in hand, I suppose it would be easy to
drive the circlip/CV/Washer sandwich on, but my memories of my one atempt
are not good.  In any event, the dished washer and circlip come with the
CV, if at all (the circlip is quite reuable and is usually *not*
supplied).  I have never seen them come with a boot kit.


I have (rarely) gotten the metal clamp with a boot kit, years ago, but not
recently.  As I said above, they are nice but you have to have the crimper
and it is expensive.  Zip ties work fine.  Use a zip tie.

The one thing that *should* come wiht a boot kit (as opposed to a boot) is
the bolts, plates, and serrated washers.  You don't mention these, but if
they were not included and the word "kit" was used, then I would say
something.

Jack, Excellent reference!!!  I have never thought to put ties *in* the
accordion pleats, but the point about not overfilling the joint is well
taken.  Also the "too thin" remark.  There are a lot of lithium greases
out there now in addition to CV grease.  CVs need *CV* grease!!!!
