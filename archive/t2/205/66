you sure it is a full 5 seconds???? usually much less.

it is probably just the lifters pumping up they rattle and if they are
turned the wrong way (and they move) they will drain off sometimes, not to
worry I think they all do this with hyd lifters.

unfortunatle Castrol is not a "True" synthetic I made the same mistake,
there is nothing wrong with synthetics IMO and I run 5w-50 year round

the valve is for another reason. if the filter gets REAL dirty it won't
starve the engine for oil.  as long as the presure pumps up and stays up
you should be fine.  synthetic stays on the engine parts better when off
so there is less stress when first starting (or so they say) because the
parts still retain some lube.

tear down an engine that has run synthetic and compare to the same engine
run dino oil and you will never run dino again.   

skip the oil cooler the type IV engine has one built in and it works
pretty good.

78 with ONLY synthetic for the life of this engine and I have only run
synthetic in ALL my vehicles since 1975, heck I got synthetic, Dextron,
GL-4, axle grease, brake fluid, and steering gearbox fluid...an ALL
synthetic bus
