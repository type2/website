Subject: Re: [T2] Starting/oil question

The problem is with the VDO aftermarket sending unit for the gauge and idiot 
light. It takes some of the senders quite a bit of time on initial cold start 
to show pressure on the gauge/turn off the oil light. This is especially true 
if you've mounted your sender with the VDO flex hose. I freaked out when this 
first happened to me, on my ' 78, so I switched back to the stock sender to 
compare. The stock sender turns the oil light off almost immediately, and is 
set at a lower warning pressure to boot. On the other hand, there are times 
when my VDO senger/guage set-up takes a good 5-7seconds to turn off the oil 
light and register pressure on the gauge after the bus has been sitting 
awhile. To make a long story short, don't sweat it.
