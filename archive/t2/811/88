Subject: side window retrofit/seals

Some notes for anyone doing window seals.

I ordered 221 845 321A for my middle windows (78/79 slider style)
          211 845 341  for my rear side windows (no vent wings/molding)

I rec'd   221 845 321B for both applications.

This part number says it's for 75-79 bus rear window with molding on
busdepot's site.
It does not have the slot for the molding.
And apparently it fits middle glass/frame windows and rear solid glass windows
equally well.

Busdepot said this was correct after a few phone calls.  I was skeptical
because my original seal for the middle sliders is molded into a rectangle and
has a clear groove in the seal for the metal window frame to sit in.

These "321B" seals are not molded, and have only the slit in the rubber, not a
groove.
Also, I did not think the middle and rear windows would have the same
perimeter dimension to utilize the same seal.

The middle window was installed last night, it took effort, had to restart a
few times,
(working alone), but in the end it fits and looks good. It tends to bulge a
little around the corners since it is not molded and it popped of the frame a
few times at these locations.

We will see how this "321B" seal fits on the rear glass.

Billy
