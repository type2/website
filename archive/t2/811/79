Amazingly enough, according to the latest Dealer price list, this (and
another similar piece) is NOT slated for obsolecense (sp?), at least in the
forseeable future, so this piece must fit other, later VW models in the line
up, I just don't know where. If anyone here on the list has a Dealer price
book, look at the "INVC" Column - if there's a "N" with a Part Number, that
means it's not returnable to the Depot, meaning they're gonna obsolete it
out REAL soon.
 Here's one to find:
 021 119 329 - Oil Cooler to Tin Seal (a sizeable rectangle) for the Type 4
engine. Retails from VW for $18.40, has a "N" Code and last I checked (last
week), not a one at any Depot in the country. Luv to have one to repro,
probably end up retailing it for around $9 if it's made. Oil cooler doesn't
function properly without it, loss of cooling air abounds with this missing.
