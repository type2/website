Subject: Call for obsolete rubber parts!

I've just made a connection with a custom molding company who is willing to
do short run parts for me. I won't have pricing until I have some data to
them...

What parts are completely NLA on our busses? Or are available but the
quality is crap? What parts would benefit from being made from Viton instead
of neoprene or whatever?
