Subject: update: hydraulic lifter blowout

My van has been back on the road for a while.  Haven't updated on the 
progress.  Anyways, Boston Bob was contacted by Omar.  He had stated that he had 
received some defective lifters from Mexico.  He had stopped using them for quite 
sometime. I guess this problem had been seen before.  I kept the lifters. 
Three of them were bad (bottoms were cracked and/or missing).  Anyway, I now have 
a new silent set of German made lifters. 
Thanks for the help and advice,
Dino.

Hello All,

Had a problem with my bus last week.  I was loosing power.  The problem 
degraded fast.  It was as if my van was out of time.  I checked the cap, spark etc. 
 Couldn't figure it out.  Long story short... took it to Omar's Auto 
(emergency mechanic, gr8 guy)... my #2 and #4 exhaust valve wouldn't open.  The 
lifters had collapsed.  Had a very hard time getting them out.  When they were 
finally removed the bottoms had partially blown out.  

The cam was fine.  pushrods were all straight.  The bottoms of the lifters 
showed no wear. When the lifters were disassembled a couple showed major wear on 
the inside.  Was this due to faulty lifters? Had anyone ever had this 
problem?  He is replacing all the lifters.

My bus is a daily driver. I drive it a lot.  I always change the oil.  I even 
use the K&N oil filter.  The engine is about 4 yrs old.  It is a 2 liter (got 
it from Boston Engine). No oil leaks.  It's been solid until this.  The only 
change I made was switching to Mobil 1 about a year ago.  I don't think that 
has anything to do with it, but I had to add the info.  How do I prevent 
something like this from happening again?  Any advice?

Thanks
