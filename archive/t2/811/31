sorry to bother all with this.
 just wanted to see if any on else was running a petronix w/ a high fire
45,000 volt coil and if so what they had set their plug gap at. at what gap
did you get the best results? did highway driving ever affect the
performance diffrently than around town?
 thanks in advance.
