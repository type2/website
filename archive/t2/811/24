Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door

Do you have the little white switch above the sliding door handle? When the 
door is latched and locked by pulling the handle back till it clicks, the 
little white latch can then be pulled back 90degrees, which locks the door. 
It moves easily, never force it. If broken, you can get another one from a 
junkyard bus by driving out the little roll pin.
It is independent of the key lock, which works differently.

I have a 71 Riviera and am wondering if I should be
able to unlock and lock the sliding door when I am
inside the bus? Nothing I push or press seems to make
a difference and when I lock and unlock from the
outside nothing on the inside moves. Thanks for your
help.
