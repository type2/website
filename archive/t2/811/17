in point of fact, they go staight to the lil' black boxO nine pins, 
and then to the turn signals.  looked at the wiring diagram this 
morning. so i have a beautiful NOS t/s switch for busses made two 
months before mine. *sigh*  so we now can add that "G" is very early 
bay to our knowledge base, at least.

while cutting the wires WOULD work, it seems a shame to cut an NOS 
item. i'm gonna check my bus and see my options, but if i decide NOT 
to give it a busectomy, anyone who HAS a 68 - 69 bus is free to email 
me for this. i paid $75,  -including-  shipping. so will you.

stevo. let me know the details on your used switch.......
