John : yes.

On my 71 "Semaphor" i can
- lock/unlock from inside with the small latch (lifting the handle while
rotating the small latch or something like that is required)
- lock/unlock from outside with the key

bot CANNOT
- unlock from inside if it was locked from outside
- unlock from outside if it was locked from inside

I don't know if it can get better than that
