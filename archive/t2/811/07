Mike,

Ummm...can't get to your link...but...what you want is no lead battery 
cables.

Admins...I can't find a proper picture except on that un-mentionable web 
site.....grrrrr

Mike, just go look at the parts store....you don't want the ones that are 
thick and made out of lead.

Also, like a lot of other things on the bus that have lasted 30 years or 
more, time to splurge and get good cables that will last you another 30 
years.  Maybe some of the other folks like Captain Nemo who switched 
over to them will chime in here ...or have a picture of them.



Trust me, they are worth every extra penny you will pay for them....oh, 
and don't forget to add the 99 cents for the red and green felt corrosion 
inhibitors as well.

Cheers, dave
