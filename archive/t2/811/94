Subject: Jet recommendations for PDSIT's?

Just curious if anybody recommends different jetting for the stock PDSIT's
on a 2.0 engine at 5400 feet?

I'm going to rebuild a pair of them this weekend for my 73 (so they match
since I only rebuilt one last time with a NOS kit).

Yes, I'm using the craptastic Echlin kits from Napa.
