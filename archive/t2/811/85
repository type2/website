Subject: no power on Aceleration

hello to all.

I m having a litle big problem in my bus. she4s an 1969, 1600 cc single port 
engine with an solex 30-pict 1 carburator. I`ve checked everything i can 
remenber but she seems to backfire throw the carb.
Every time i step on the gas a bit faster it stumbles and lose rpm but if i 
don4t acelarate or step slowly there is nothing wrong.
I wonder if the problem is the carb but what I  don4t understand is why she 
ran well before.
i4ve cheked the valves, the poits, the timing, the spark plugs and now i 
honestly don4t know what to do.

thank4s in advance.
Grettings from Portugal.
