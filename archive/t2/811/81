Subject: What was the other injector cleaner you recommended John?

John, I CAN'T get Techron anymore in Canada because it's manufactured in the

states and doesn't have childproof caps, so it's banned up here. We must all

be kids I guess. :-) You were mentioning another fuel injector cleaner you

said was just as good, was it's Wynn's?? Can't remember, so maybe you could

enlighten me again?

Thanks,

Courtney
