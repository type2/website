A locksmith (which one are you?) at HCBF showed me this trick- if it's 
hard to use the key to unlock the door after the button was pushed down, 
unscrew the upper large phillips screw holding the latch on the door 
side edge.  Stick the extender nozzle of a silicone spray lube into this 
hole and aim down as you spray and push -pull the knob and turn the key.
Worked for us.
