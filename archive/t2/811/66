Subject: Squeek!

Hiya All,

The Duck is driving me nuts with this squeek.  Really annoying and it sounds 
as if it is coming from within the passenger cabin.  However after taking 
everything (seats, air vents, spare tire) out of the cabin the squeek is still 
there.  Since it sounds off on uneven pavement I'm assuming that the rear 
suspension is involved.  I sat the daughter in the back and drove around.  She thinks 
its coming from just under the third seat area.  She said it sounded like 
rubber on metal.

My best guess was either the spring plate bushings or the diagonal arm 
bushings.  I attended to both of those.  The squeek is still there.

Any ideas on what to look for next?  I'm slowly losing what I have left of my 
marbles.

Mike
