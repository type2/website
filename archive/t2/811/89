Hi,

Home again... for a short time. And working on the type-2 1969 bus again. I
managed to replace the generator... I am proud I have done the whole job
without any problem... Exept for now: I lifted the fan cover as per Muir,
now I want to fix it again with the two bolts left and right... but I cannot
reach the hole of the left bolt. It was difficult to remove it so it is not
a surprise... I tried and tried but my fingers are not long enough. Any tips
or tricks?

The old generator's axis is worn out. Can I replace it myself? Does it need
major overhaul in a shop?

Love from Belgium...
