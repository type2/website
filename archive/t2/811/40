Hmmm... By nature and definition, dielectrics are electrically 
non-conductive. They may coat and prevent corrosion on certain metals, 
but they also electrically insulate. While the insulation may be minimal 
to negligible in this application, the whole purpose here is to increase 
the conductivity of the connections.
I believe it would be better to use a purpose designed product. For 
batteries I like the red anti-corrosion stuff in a tube by the battery 
products in the store. Electrical supply houses also sell an 
anti-corrosion grease (use it all the time at work, but can't recall the 
name now) specifically for electrical connections. Years ago, it was 
called CuAl Aid, designed for copper to aluminum connections. In a 
pinch, I've used never-seize (high graphite content). I've used all 
three on my van. The red stuff, along with the red and green felt 
washers has been on my BMW's conventional battery for five years, and 
there is no corrosion. OTOH, my two sealed gell deep cycle batteries on 
my sailboat have nothing on them (protectant or corrosion), and they 
have been in the marine environment since 1996. Some old timers I know 
place a copper penny on the top of the battery.
Overall, I believe leaking battery acid is the culprit.
