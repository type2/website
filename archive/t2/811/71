Slip of the keyboard on the year spread ;-)
 These have been a bitch of late to get outa Europe, almost for the past
year they've only been available through a VW Dealership that exports and
they don't give 'em away (price very high for the qty we buy and sell). The
major exporters themselves don't wanna mess with small parts like this, so
they're cutting them from their programs.
 The criteria VWG uses to make make parts is this:
 OEM totally NLA
Current Repro is GARBAGE
Current Repro or OEM available cost is too high
Reliability of supply, hard to source from maker or distributor
 Or a combination of all of the above.
 Here's an example: The Seal for the Fresh Air Hoses to the tin on Late
63-71 Buses, Late 63-79 Beetles (the thin one intro'd in 68 actually). The
maker is in Europe - in fact he bought the tooling from the OEM that
supplied VW and is making them on his own there in Germany. But his
reliability of supply has become so flaky in the past year to the point
where we've been on Backorder from him since March. We decided to make them
instead and will have them on the shelf around the first of the year or so.
Sure you can get them from WCM, CIP, etc., but those are Brazilian garbage,
so you see.....And we're making the original style tall one as well. There
are several other items that he has supplied to us that we're either
thinking of making or are going to make, all because he's flaked on us and
other outfits here in the US. People want quality parts now, not a year from
now.
 VWG is now manufacturing more than 500 items for Bugs, Ghias, Buses and
soon Vanagons. We have at least 50-60 items in the discussion, planning,
prototyping or production stage to be intro'd in the next 6 to 9 months.
Stay Tuned.

Jim, why are you making these when VW still is?

I thought is was OK to repro obsolete NLA parts. But these are still in
production.

And on a side note, they only fit 68 if the person has replaced the upper
and lower reservoirs and the plastic
tube from a 69/70. 68 was one year only with a metal tube between them.
