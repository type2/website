Subject: Airconditioning on type 1 motor?

Hi all,
I have another request for parts information.
Does anybody have a good picture, or VW part number for the bracket the
factory made to mount air-conditioning compressors on type 1 motors?
I know the factory (Germany) fitted aircon to beetles in the mid '70's, and
also it was fitted to Brazilian/Mexican beetles.
I'd like to either find a factory bracket, or get enough detail on how they
attached to the motor to make my own.
I have seen a couple of aftermarket brackets and know some dealers fitted it
as an option, but if I'm going to make one I'd prefer to copy what the factory
did rather than a back yard version.
Regards,
Richard
