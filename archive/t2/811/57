Subject: Re: [T2] Call for obsolete rubber parts!

 The cost of making the short run isn't the issue, but the cost of tooling
up is. At VWG, we investigated in doing small molded parts in rubber,
neoprene, viton, etc., and in order to make a quality item it was determined
that for the long term, one has to spring the $$$ for tooling that is
durable and has longevity. In addition to this, certain grades of certain
temperature-rated rubber or neoprene for molded engine rubber items
necessitated that short run molds weren't the way to go, quality was shlock.
As some examples, we make some late Bus items already the old fashion way:
 Neoprene Elbow, Air Cleaner Breather on 71-74
Neoprene Elbow, Aux Air Valve on 75-83
Alt Air Exhaust Elbow/Boot on 72-79 55amp Alt
Rubber Sleeve, Upper Reservoir to Lower Reservoir Plastic Tube on 68-79
Rubber Sleeve, Tube to Servo Hose on 74-79
 In the works and testing:
Dipstick Boot on 72-79
 **Note: this one's a bit tougher than we planned**
Alt Air Exhaust Elbow/Boot on 75-79 70amp Alt
Brake Line Grommets
FI Air Intake Elbow, Air & WaterBoxer Vanagons
+more to come
 My advice to Don is to go slow and careful
 To Dave Bolen (and the list et al) - We are looking at doing the 75-79 FI
Air Intake Elbow, but tooling on Vanagon ones above is proving to be a
challenge in both materials and cost. You're observation is being proved
correct.
