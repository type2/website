Subject: Headlight aimers??

Has anyone ever come across a cheaply priced headlight aimer like you used to see in the old days at any garage. They would suction cup it on to your headlight then adjust your headlight to the correct specs?? All the ones I see are 1000's of dollars!!

Thanks,
Courtney
