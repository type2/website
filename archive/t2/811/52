Uh oh, I see a technical section. :-)

Seaking of which, I wrote two more article recently. The first one shows what's inside the EGR box behind the kick panel on some buses. I was curious how it worked so I took one apart.

The second one is an attempt to describe the inner workings of the bus charging system. I'm still working on the alternator problem diagnosis section but thought it was worth posting what I had so far.

I also updated my hydraulic lifter article to add some diagrams showing exactly how the lifters are constructed and how they work:

Enjoy.
