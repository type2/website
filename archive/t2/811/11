Subject: door latch

Hey, guys.  My driver's side door latch is sometimes hard to open.  Usually it works ok, but occasionally I have to use both hands to squeeze hard enough for it to open.  I tried PB Blaster in it but no help.  I haven't taken the door panel off and looked around yet but I just wondered if this is a common bus problem and how it's fixed.  Thanks....KR
