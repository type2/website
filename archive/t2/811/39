Subject: Refridgerator Repair replacement/repair options 

Hello all:

I brought the fridge unit out of my '74 Westy to a local refrigeration 
shop to have them take a look at it. The thing hasn't worked since I got 
my bus about 6 years ago... and mostly has sat in the basement. They 
said it was too old a system to work on and quoted me $700 to get all 
the inner workings replaced.... needless to say that isn't gonna happen.

So I ask the list if there is any hope on repair. From what I see there 
is some kind of transformer there that I know for a fact does not work. 
It looks like someone replaced it once as some of the wires are hacked. 
But it looks to have once worked on both AC and DC. I took it out and 
tested it and got nothing on both sides. Anyone have a parts source on 
this? I know there are  wiring diagrams on the net of the later ('76-'79 
unit) but nothing on the '74-'75 unit. Are they at all similar?  If I 
can get the electrical components in working order, where should I go 
from there? Is it possible to refill the coolant/refrigerant if it needs it?

Does anyone know of a replacement fridge that will fit in the stock 
location?

Just trying to see what options are out there.

thanks
Eddie
'74 Westy
