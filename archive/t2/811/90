Subject: Re: no power on Aceleration

Hi!

Another possible explanation is dirt in the fuel line--maybe at the filter 
screen at the bottom of the gas tank. Not enough blockage to stop the flow 
of gas completely, but enough to prevent running much above idle speed. That 
would explain the symptoms, including might why the trouble began suddenly.

Hope this helps. Good luck!
