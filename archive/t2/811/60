Subject: Westy tops different from 76 to 79??

Just wondering if the pop tops are the same on the later model westy tops? Would my 77 top be identical to the later 78 and 79's? My 77 has a step on the fiberglass top that goes all around, but I don't remember the 78 or 79 having this step. My memory seems to tell me that the 78 and 79 had a top with no step, just straight up on the sides.
