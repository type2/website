Thanks, Dave.  But I'm not sure what you meant by "buy the ones that look
like the ones in your newer car"

Do you mean these instead of the heavy looking lead ones?  I've never owned
a newer car...

I'd already thought about just replacing the cables, but just wanted to know
if I was headed in the right direction.
