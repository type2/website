Subject: Thanks to Mike Benthin - Engine install update

THANK YOU Mike!

Even though I wasn't specific enough in my first post (Mike thought I was
woking on a different engine tranny combo) Mike gave me an idea and a
reminder. Seems I had a stripped down 1800 case in my back shed. Pulled the
studs out of that and found they are the perfect length for my 80 Vanagon.
Thanks again.

This is a classic illustration of the fact that we can't ask enough questions
or give enough answers. Now if I could just learn to explain myself well
enough so folks know what bus I'm working on.
