Thanks John,
I'm Kinda past the problem with the throwout bearing, Tied the clutch lever 
up with a heavy cord for now to keep the T. O. bearing out of the way. I 
suspect there is still air in the line. I'll Try pressure bleeding it in the 
morning. Had to give up for the evening when my shop light burned out. I 
think I just need to get the input shaft to line up with the pilot bearing 
and I'll be home free.
