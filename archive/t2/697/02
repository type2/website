Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes bleeding revisited

All I can say is that I know what you mean when you're talking about a
fully functional braking system.

After repairing the leaky drum cylinder on the right rear, new
pads/shoes, did a bleed, and drove it, I was amazed at how awesome the
brakes felt. I thought I was driving my Volvo at first!
