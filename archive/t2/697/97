If by 'front' you mean the side towards the front of the van, I have an 81
AC with maybe a 2"  gap in the seal right there, and have been told on the
vanagon list that they are all like that. I see it and wonder why, but
they told me that a brand new seal will still have the gap <shrug>

If find out I am wrong, I would like to know about it :-)

Thanks,

John
