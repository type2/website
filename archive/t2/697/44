Subject: Engine install update

I finaly got the engine mated to the transmition today! Put the nuts on the
two top bolts and snugged them up.
crawled underneath the passenger side and put the nut on that stud, HMMM the
stud is a little short. The end of the stud is flush with the surface of the
nut, not serious but I like to see a few threads sticking out of the nut. Slid
over to the drivers side and the horror set in! the stud is flush with the
boss on the bell housing. No threads beyond the boss to start the nut on.
Called the rebuilder and they are overnighting a new set of studs. Snow
predicted for the next two days. :~(

How many threads should be turned into the case for strength? I'm going to
have to pull the motor back out and pull the studs out. If there is enough
thread in the case maybe I can just back them out and get the engine going
today.

The moral of the story: Never trust anyone elses quality control regardless of
their reputation! Always check EVERYTHING. We are all human and prone to
mistakes.
