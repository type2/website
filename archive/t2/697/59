Subject: RE: brake booster line

"What it
does is this,  you hit the brakes, they are high and stiff, but barely work. "

This is a good description of boosted brakes when the booster doesn't work!

I still need to know what the internal diameter of the brake booster hose 
is. I've seen both 15/32" and 1/2" in the archives. I presume the original 
was metric (12mm?). Any suggestions?

Cheers,
