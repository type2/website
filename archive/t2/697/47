Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install update

Greg,
I guess I misled you with some of my previous posts. This is my 80 Vanagon 
With the original 80 transmission. I bought the engine from a well know 
rebuilder. They seem to think the studs are for an automatic tranny, I have 
a manual trans.

Might you know, or any of you out in listyville know, how many threads 
should be engaged into the case for propper strength? the stud that was just 
barely long enough to get the nut on had 5 threads sticking out of the case. 
The short one had none. Thinking about backing the short one out enough to 
get the nut on.

Tom
75 bus "Turtlebus"
80 Westy "as yet unnamed"
Bus-ted minds want to know
