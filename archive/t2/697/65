This stuff probably happens all the time, but I wanted to tell this story. I'll make it as short as possible. I posted some parts that I had left after the sale of my 71 Weekender and 69 Westfalia parts bus. Gail Doles contacted me and asked for the leveler pad that go over the engine compartment to make the fold out bed level. We struck a deal and I go get an estimate on shipping from my local UPS drop off. They quoted me about $30. This was estimated on the pads put on the scale unwrapped to Gail's zip. So I give that info to Gail and we agree again on the shipping cost. High, but still not a bad cost for original pads in good condition. (I've never seen any for sale.) I box 'em up and take them back to the same place and the cost is now $106! I was stunned. The guy at the counter measured and weighed and checked, said if I reduce the width an inch, it drops to $69. Still way too high. Gail and I scratched our heads and thought maybe if I wrapped it in heavy plastic and shipped it
 to Snoopy, he could take it to Edisto for the campout. After contacting him, he sent out an alert and Tony (Hippydog) and Paula in Marion, NC  respond that they will take them to Edisto. They live in a town about 25 miles away. The end result is that Gail gave us both some gas money and she will have her pads at Edisto with a small refund from me. My thanks to Hippydog and Paula, Snoopy, and to Gail. With helpful, flexible people like this in the bus community, we can continue to enjoy these vehicles for years to come. 
 
Now having said all that, is anyone traveling from Las Vegas to NC that might be able to haul a set of Beetle seats? Oh well, it never hurts to ask.
