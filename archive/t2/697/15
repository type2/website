Subject: Re: [T2] Should I install that caliper ?

You will never get them to bleed with the bleeder on the bottom. You could
take it off, remove the pads, hold it upside down or hang with some wire
(not the brake hose) and use a piece of wood to keep the piston from popping
out while bleeding that wheel. Then just clean & reinstall. Keep fingers
clear!!
