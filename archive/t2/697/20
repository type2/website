Tom,

As with the brakes, the flex line can clog although this sounds more like
something has gone wrong in the clutch master to me.  As with brakes a
complete overhaul should include not only a new slave but a new master and
new flex line as well.

My imagination of what you are describing and your description match,
though that does not mean very much.  it certainly wraps on the throwout
crosshaft before the lever is attached to the crosshaft and hooks onto
the lever, yes.  It shoudl also have some pre-tension on it.

Now that I read this far, however, if the return spring is not in place
then there may not be anything wrong with the hydraulics at all[1].  That
spring exerts a considerable force!

OOK!

[1] Well, OK, there probably still is, but you may be able to slide with
just the return spring in place for a bit 'til you get a new clutch MC.
