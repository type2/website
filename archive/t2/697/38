Subject: RE: [T2] dashboard clock

Tach, mixture meter, TV screen (for reverse camera), air vent, snow globe, aquarium, mirror, metric speedo, snow cone dispenser, hair dryer vent, strobe light for anti-theft protection (blinds driver), speaker, change cup, swamp creature portal option, water sprayer (wets down thief before the seat electrifies), paint ball gun (wet down thief, blind him with strobe, electrify driver's seat, then nail his with rapid fire paint balls or tomatoes...), thermometer, one of those COOL dual needle aircraft head temp gauges (1 needle per head), modified radio and display (basic controls to digital stereo), 

and #1 oddest mod: install a vintage VW clock in there...
