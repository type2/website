Subject: 72 Westy

Hello List-
My 72 Westy needs a home.  It is in Dutchess County NY, about 70 miles north
of
New York City.  I am moving and have no place for it. It runs with an APV
rebuild (1.8 L) that has 2.0 L heads on it since the others failed. The
brakes
don't work. It is primer Grey.  I drove this bus 17k miles and intended to
fix
it up (again).  Anyone want it? real cheap.
Thanks,
John Ingram
