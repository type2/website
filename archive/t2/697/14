Subject: Re: [T2] Should I install that caliper ?

OOH! I can answer this one!!! Only cuz it goes for ALL vehicles.. heh

If the bleeder is at the bottom, the fluid pressure cavity in the
caliper will NOT have the air properly evacuated. The air will be up
at the top of the cavity. While bleeding you will be sucking fluid
from the bottom and pulling it from the hose that's in the middle. So
the air trapped up there stays up there.

It *is* possible to make it work in an emergency though, but I don't
recommend it. (Read the last paragraph though...)

Set the caliper in place and bolt it up just enough to keep it from
flopping off. Attach the brake hose. Remove the caliper and rotate it
so the screw is at the top. Either place a piece of iron close to the
size of your disk in the caliper to keep the piston from popping out,
or use a vacuum pump, and bleed. Attach the caliper. Make sure during
bleeding you are not stretching or kinking the hose at all. One wrong
crease or twist will weaken the hose, setting you up for a
catastrophic failure.

The problem here is every time you need to bleed the caliper you will
need to remove it. Will you honestly remember to do it and not be too
lazy? And if you don't you degrade the safety of your vehicle
drastically.

Also, I seem to recall someone stating there was a mechanical
difference in the bolt shafts here just a couple days ago. that would
prevent the wrong caliper from being used. I don't recall noticing one
way or the other when I did my brakes though...
