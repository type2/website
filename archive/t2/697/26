You're supposed to adjust the carbs to 500-700 RPM using the volume
control screws after removing the wire to the cut-off valve at the
central idling system, then checking for balance with equal RPM drop
from disconnecting the wire from the idling cut off from each side one
at a time. If you removed them, you might try pulling a plug wire from
each side to check RPM drop. After adjusting this, you reconnect
everything and set mixture at the central idling system with your
exhaust analyzer.

Also, too rich can cause backfire too. Need exhaust analyzer!

 He says they are too lean, and they can't seem to
 richen them up.
 He even tried replacing the 50 electromagnetic idle
 jets with manual 55s.
 Still too lean.
