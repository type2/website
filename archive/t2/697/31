Cardone has started making new stuff?  I've been out of parts for about a year but 
I thought they were mostly a rebuilder.. 

With that out of the way .. its possible that you're hitting a "right box, wrong part"
situation and what's actually in the box is the *left* caliper, 19452.  That sort of 
thing happens more often than people like to admit.  Maybe see if they've got
Raybestos RWC45240 in stock, it's also the right-side caliper, unloaded.
