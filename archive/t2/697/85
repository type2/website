Don, I hate to tell you this, but if these are 2-ply rated tires they really
are not safe for your Bus. The fact that they say "LT" does not mean
anything; their sidewall is not stiff enough for your particular
application. The problem is that this is something you may not notice in
normal driving, but you might find out the hard way. In a panic situation,
the difference in sidewall flex could mean the difference between being able
to maneuver your way out of an accident or not.

If the salesperson told you they are load range C and they're not, he misled
you and sold you a tire that does not meet minimum safety specs for your
bus. As a tire dealer he should know better, and for liability reasons alone
he should not have sent you out of his shop with those tires. You really
aught to consider getting him to take them back.  Given that I sell the
correct Bus tires for just $69 each, I'm sure that at the very least he
should be able to find you a correct tire as an even exchange for the $95
each you already paid him. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but it's
my honest opinion. If I paid $400 for a set of load range C tires for my bus
only to find out they weren't load range C as promised, I'd be pissed.
