Subject: tire specs? whats a spec?

Well, seems like only 2 weeks ago we tried to explain--to each his own, and
props to the man for being on his own adventure, a roadtrip I wish I was on.
The value of reinforced sidewalls is not obvious while reading email, but it
becomes more relevant on mountain hairpin turns and in desert crosswinds.  I
drove for a few years on passenger car tires.  they'll get you down the
road.  A load index of 95 is adequate and corresponds to 1521 lb. at max
PSI.  On the bright side, a new 2-ply tire is loads better than an old
dry-rotted one!  and if the correct tires ever become a priority, they will
make good spares.

Tire shops will try to sell you whatever is on their shelf.  they don't
normally stock the best bus tire, and many "counter sales" folks are only
looking out for their best interests, not yours.  Granted, bus tires may be
a 'special order' but usually they can have them the next day.

I recently limped to a respectable mom-n-pop tire store in a very small town
after a blowout from a rotten 185R14C michelin XZX (just too old), and the
spare was rotten also and barely made it the 14 miles (not my bus).   That
shop refused to sell me even a Load Range C that they didn't think was the
right size.  I had to make it to the show that night, so I crossed my
fingers and limped a few blocks across town to buy a pair of Load Range B
185R14's from a less-diligent shop (the only other one) just so I could get
out of that town.  I still respect the first shop's opinion.  But I was
desperate to leave that place and did what I had to do.  Like I said, not my
bus.
