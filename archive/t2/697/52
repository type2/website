Subject: RE: brake booster line

     Im new here, been lurking a few weeks. I just bought a 71 westy. I 
really wanted a 68-69 but this one came around. Its pretty clean and the 
price was right.Already took it camping even.  Its not my only vw of course, 
but im new to bays.  In my research the 71 braking system seems to be 
troublesome. Needles to say 500 miles later (1 weekend of camping) my brakes 
are bad (booster issues).  Im looking to change the line first, but cant 
find the line.  I called a hydraulics shop and they can get simular line but 
say its not of course for vacuum..  Someone else recommended putting a 
spring in it so it wont collapse. I might do this if need be.  One of the 
lines up front IS collapsed so im hoping its something dumb and just want to 
replace all the big line having to do with the booster. I checked for dumb 
thinds, and checked the 1 way valve, seems ok.  No lines fall off. What it 
does is this,  you hit the brakes, they are high and stiff, but barely work. 
  I am not where the bus is so cant really test anything. I saw a test for 
it on thesamba and tried to do it, but where it differed was, it was stiff 
and unresposive befoer the more was even on!  I looked under the bus and a 
'big line' was collapsed up front, i dont know if it was theo ne from the 
tube from the back or the  'vent' . i havent had a chance to play with it, 
id like to have the line before I do..
