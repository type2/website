Tom asked:


 Also, on Bosch spark plug cables; are the cables supposed to be removable from
the insulator/boot that ataches to the spark plug? I noticed that my Bentley
shows a spec. for the resistance of the insulator. Haven't tried to pull them
apart but I'm curious.

The resister end UNSCREWS off the wire. It has what appears to be a sheet metal screw in the end. Do not pull
it off!!
