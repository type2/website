Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt carbs/too lean problems

On my PDSIT's I was getting popcorn backfiring at idle, and an idle
that wouldn't stay steady over days of time.

Turned out to be yet another vacuum leak. 

Just keep working them. If you're getting good mixture at speed, then
it's either a bad mixture adjustment or another vacuum leak.

Also, I know I've said this lots of times, MAKE SURE your idle intake
pipe (the tall one on the left carb) is connected to the port on your
aircleaner. I can't stress this enough. If it's just open you WILL
have idle issues.
