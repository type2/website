Not quite right: the mixture needs to be leaner, not richer!  The air is
thinner at altitude, so the mixture needs less fuel, not more.

Of course, it's *very* important to re-enrich the mixture as you descend to
lower altitudes.  Forgetting to do this is a common mistake that pilots make,
as virtually all piston-engine airplanes still have manual mixture controls in
the cockpit...
