Subject: 1980 Vanagon air seal

I'm Looking for a 2" peace of the air seal that goes around the engine tin on
my 80 Vanagon. My exsisting seal is in great shape but there is a small gap at
the front of the engine. It probably doesn't have a large effect on cooling
but it bothers me. If anyone has there old seal they replaced and it still has
an inch or three that's still in good shape, I am interested. This is not the
foam seal the bay window busses use, It's the rubbery one that clips on the
tin.

Also, on Bosch spark plug cables; are the cables supposed to be removable from
the insulator/boot that ataches to the spark plug? I noticed that my Bentley
shows a spec. for the resistance of the insulator. Haven't tried to pull them
apart but I'm curious.

Thanks
Tom
