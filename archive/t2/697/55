I ran a large gauge cable, about 1/2 the size of a battery cable (number 4
wire?) , from my spare battery through a 30 amp breaker, to a separate fuse
box that uses the more modern spade type fuses.  It allows lots of juice to
get to the box, and the 30 amp breaker acts as a first line of defence
against electric gremlins.
Since electrons only flow on the outside of the wire (thank you two years of
college physics!) use a multi-strand wire to get the most juice.  I got my
cable from a battery specialty shop, but you could also get them almost
anywhere.
