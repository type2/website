it's worth mentioning here that some of the bay window fuse boxes 
(1971, for example) have an unused/accessories fuse position.  For some 
reason I want to say it's #8 or #9 on the '71.  

As a result, you can run your accessories line through a fuse (always a 
smart idea) without having to modify anything.
