And, with all that fiddling around on top of the motor and the mechanic
repeating "too lean" over and over...

Have you gone through and made sure the exhaust is all tight and there are
absolutely no exhaust leaks?

An exhaust leak will cause exactly the same symptoms. Popcorn backfire at
idle and machine gun when decelerating.

Come to think of it, a loose head will also. Though you'll usually get
chirping birds and problems at high speed also with a loose head.
