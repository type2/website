Those springy finger things are located at 3:00 and 9:00.
Squeeze them and push the clock towards the steering
wheel and out of the dash.

I've got a junkyard salvage working T3 clock, made in Feb 1970.
The clock body/can measures ~ 85mm.  The bezel's OD ~ 90mm.

I wonder if anyone has tried fitting a T3 clock in their
bay window bus too.
