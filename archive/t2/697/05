Subject: Alternator pulley

Is it possible to put a dual pulley on an alternator of a 77 type 2?  I was
considering adding a small generator head from harbor freight (ITEM
45416-1VGA ) to my bus and using the existing system to power it. I'd only
be adding the belt to power it as needed (and when parked) but I was just
wondering if anyone had ever tried this?
