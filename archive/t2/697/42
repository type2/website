Subject: Baywindow brake booster line?

Is the line that goes from the brake booster back tot he engine metal
somewhere along the line?  I took a brake MC and Booster off of a Bay some
time ago and don't remember if it
was a rubber hose all the way or a metal line part the way.  Putting a bay
front-end with booster in my split.
