>!!!! 6 Months??!?!?!?!?!

Well... Five months and some weeks exactly. We will be back to celebrate new
year, leaving the end of july.
We already tested the foam of the bed a lot; it's not an original camper and
not a fold-out bed, in fact we sleep on cushions on top of the boxes where
our clothes go in. We both have no complains.
But there will also be two air-matresses aboard... and a tent in case the
bus fails mechanycally.
I already got the digicam and will add some pics to my website next year.

I did not know about the Mike Knappmann-pages. Thanks for the link.

going to have a sore back after 6 days, let alone 6 months. heh

BTW: Bart, Mike Knappmann's pages
http://vwbus.dyndns.org/bulli/michaelk/vw_bus_e/mein_bus.htm &
http://vwbus.dyndns.org/bulli/michaelk/vw_bus_d/mein_bus.htm have a lot of
information about travelling in places like Morocco and fixing up the bus
for that sort of trip, they might be useful, they're certainly very
interesting. I'm jealous, your trip should be wonderful ;^)
