Hi -

You're on the right track going to a hydraulics shop -- other folks have also
had good luck at truck parts stores, which apparently do carry larger hoses
that are actually meant for vacuum lines.

Once you get it working right, your '71's braking system will be safer and
more effective than a '68-70's due to the disc brakes in front, so be glad!
:-)

Just don't assume that the brake booster hose is your only problem...

Good luck!
