Here is how we did it:
1) Take old clutch disk that you no longer need.
2) Cut a foot of broomstick.
3) Drive the broomstick through the center of the old clutch plate. You may 
have to trim it a bit to fit at first, but once you get it started a 4 lb 
sledge will drive it the rest of the way through. I supported the clutch 
disk on a couple of cinder blocks. It only took about a dozen whacks.
4) When done, it will fit the alignment notches quite well and you can use 
it again and again. You may want to trim the end down to a little more of a 
point to get it to center in the gland nut bearing, but that isn't super 
critical.

I still have the one my Dad made in 1973. It is only 6 inches long now 
because we kept "fine tuning" the end and it kept getting shorter.
