Richard, thanks for doing this - very interesting stuff. I'm assuming that 
the 009 would differ from the rest in that it kind of just sits there until 
it hits a certain RPM then shoots straight up?

Would this support that maybe I should get the CIP1 dizzy instead of one 
from ACN?

Does how the dizzys advance have nothing to do with whether you have a type 
1 or type 4 engine?

A new SVDA is going to be my next part purchase. :)
