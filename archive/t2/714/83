Subject: Stool or Cube?  (Was Cabinets)

Hi folks:

Looking at both Mike's and Kevin's photos I see this little cube stool 
thing with a cushion on it matching the Westy upholstery.  Is this 
designed to hold "Mr. Crapper's invention'? An Ice Box?

My Westy did not have one but as a stool and  fourth seat, (with or 
without what came inside) it would SURE come in handy.

Where can I find one of these?  Is it Westy original?

Thanks,

BEN
