   Never realized that compartment (behind the driver seat) was for the
  spare as mine's on the front of the bus .........

Thanks to Tom Tarka for posting my geocities site pics (email me for 
larger pics- sites shuts down with excessive hits)- you can see in my 
interior mods ( http://www.ruddy.net/~tommy/benthin/interior.html ) how 
I took the spare tire cabinet and cut the sides down to let it be a 
flush hinged door to access three shelves for all my tools. The front 
mounted spare tire cover I also made.
