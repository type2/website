Subject: Dirt bike in a pass-through westy

Thinking about getting a dual purpose motorcycle.  
Looked one in the paper (81 Honda XL250s) on-line and ad sheet spec
says heigth ~47 inches, length ~56 inches.

As the height of the sliding door opening is around 4 feet, is it
reasonable to expect that I could move this in my bus in a pinch?
(Dang, didn't measure length..but going to ask anyway)

I'd also appreciate advice regarding this bike off-line. 

Thanks,

Dean

p.s. It's very hard to make a bus sculpture out of mashed yams. I
failed but had enough fun to burn a batch of bacon. :-P
