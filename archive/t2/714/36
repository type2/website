The following was was my response to a similar question on TheSamba,
regarding how the Koni's might stack up to the less-expensive KYB's...

Choosing a shock generally involves a compromise between handling and
comfort. Most lower-priced shocks err in one direction or the other. Either
they give your Bus too firm a ride (very responsive but uncomfortably hard;
almost go-cart like) or too soft a ride (mushy, poor cornering, and a
tendancy toward wind-buffeting). It takes good engineering and build quality
to strike a good balance between the two. What's more, over time a shock's
action will become softer, so its handling gradually deteriorates long
before it actually "fails" (leaks).

The beauty of the Koni's is that they actually allow you to "dial in" the
ride firmness upon installation (or reinstallation). With any other shock,
you have to live with the setting that the manufacturer chose; once you buy
it you'rs stuck with it. With the Koni's you choose it yourself. What's
more, even as the shocks age, you can simply readjust them to restore them
to the setting that you originally chose. So you can start off with the ride
that you like, and can maintain that ride forever.

There are good hydraulic shocks that are mid-point in price between the
Koni's and the KYB's, and also strike a middle ground performance-wise. I
sell a wider range of these than anyone. This includes two levels of
Sachs/Boges (both of them German made; I have to import them from Europe
myself, as the ones that Boge sells in the U.S. are Mexican made), and the
AlKo's (which are a great value, probably more shock for the buck than the
Boges IMHO). All are better than the somewhat harder-riding KYB's (which I
also sell) in my personal opinion, and are good alternatives if the Koni's
are beyond your budget. But none can equal the
performance/flexibility/adjustability of the Koni's. The Koni's are
completely unique in their ability to let you "dial in" the ride that you
like, and keep it that way over the life of your Bus.
