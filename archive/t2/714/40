There are specs in the Bentley.

The 205P curve is ideal for a 76-78 bus. I wanted to give those people an
idea how the available vacuum distributors compare (they were originally FI
beetle dizzys).

Two people have asked me to graph the 009 curve as well. Unfortunately I
didn't have one handy or else I would have taken it along. I still have
access to the machine so I'll try to do it next time I go.
