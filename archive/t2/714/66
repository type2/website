There has been a lot of discussion on this in the
past... There are
"close" veneers out there, but not the original stuff.
Even if you
found the original veneer, the color would be
different due to age and
fading.

A couple of years ago I went to a local custom cabinet
shop and went through a couple hundred samples and
found what I think is *almost * an exact match. I had
him make me a stove/sink cover for my 79 deluxe Westy.
To this day no one has been able to tell which piece
is the replacement. I bought a 4x8 piece and ended up
with much left over. BTW..he matched the black molding
just as well.
