Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor curves graphed

I can't say my advance curve matches, but I can tell
you my bus is running way better now.
     
For anyone who cares to listen:  You were all correct.
 In Nov-Dec '04, I admitted to the T2 list my 78 FI
engine was running with an 009.  I was quickly set
straight.  During a scheduled tune-up in February, I
had the www2.cip1.com "205" SVDA installed.  Geez, its
like night and day.  Engine has more power, is not
balky on the freeway, and seems to just run better. 
Especially more power up hills.
     
As directed, we used the VWC-043-905-205 German /
Bruck Distributor, whose Vacuum Can and springs are
supposed to be the same specs as the
C24-043-905-205-ZB, which is manufactured by Bosch
Mexico.  The Bruck "205" is $20 or so cheaper.  My
advance curve is now <supposed to be> very close to
the Bentley Page 5-75 "021-905-205P" specs.
    
Thank you T2 list.  You were correct.  My advance
curve probably matches now.  But whether it does or
not, my bus is running better now.
