Interesting- how about the bus covered with Henson Muppets seen at High
Country and also published into the "VW BUS" 2003 book by William Burt,
isbn 0-7603-1319-9  BTW, I never was asked for permission to include my
78 "236,000 mi never rebuilt" Westy.

 However, it is true that you are much more likely
 to attract the attention of the interest holder
 if you are making a money of the potential

 Disney has ALWAYS been aggressive, but they are
 more friendly to their customers in enforcing
 their rights.  I knew a guy with 7 dwarves
 painted on the side of his green deluxe camper.
 He got a cease and desist letter but also got
 some sort of free license to continue..........
