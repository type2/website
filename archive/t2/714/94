Hi Will,

The website you referred to reads as follows:

and further states:

This is definitely the case in regards to Mike's bus and the book in 
question. Mike's bus was photographed in a public space and published 
in a book about buses. I don't have the book handy but I'm pretty sure 
there isn't even a VW logo on the nose, as I think Mike carries his 
spare there.

I am not a lawyer, nor do I play one on TV. I just take my camera with 
me, and if I see something I like, I take a picture. (Unless a cop says 
otherwise... I hate it when that happens.)


Happy trails,

Depends.  You should get a signed release from corporations for photos,
film or video of trademarks, etc.  Often brands are obscured on tv for
this reason.
