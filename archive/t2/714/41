This is great, Richard... I guess you managed to get the dizzy out of  
my Bus :-)

The graph says "Mechanical Advance"... in your message, you say that  
the vacuum cans are basically all identical... how easy is it to run  
this test while adding vacuum advance?

For those of us with ACN SVDAs, I guess we can compensate for the  
slower advance by timing a few degrees further forward at idle...
