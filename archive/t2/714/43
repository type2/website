Subject: Wiper Problem - '70 Type 2

Scott,
        Have you got the wiper assembly out of the microbus?  If you can run it 
with some test leads to a battery, with the cover off, with the linkage off the 
motor output shaft, look for sparking at the brushes.  See if gets up to 
reasonable speed.  Maybe you can measure the current (amps)?  Check the 
grease... may be dried near solid.  Let us know.  Glenn

I've got a wiper circuit that blows fuses and am troubleshooting the switch
and motor.  the shafts are free and not causing a lockup.  Does anyone have
an switch diagram or schematic of the internals of the wiper switch for a 70
Type 2?  The Bentley schematic just show a switch and not detail.  Also, I
measure about .6 ohms across the 2 wires that go into the motor.  I would
expect to measure a small winding resistance, but this seems strangely low.
What do you think?
