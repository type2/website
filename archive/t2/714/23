I am just theorizing here as I have never seen a 68/69 lower mount.
Since the Koni accepts a 12mm bolt is it possible to drill out the lower
mount to accept it also. That seems much easier than fitting a sleeve to
a bolt hole and not that extreme of a project.

***********************
Not a minor mod! If you put these Konis on a 68/69, the shocks will
knock at the lower mounts.

By knock you mean the 10mm bolt wouldn't hold the shock in place? It
might also be possible to get some hard rubber, like in an original mini
cooper shock, and use that as the sleeve. Sort of a bushing insert.

Just ideas,
