Subject: Wiper Problem - '70 Type 2

Hello,

I've got a wiper circuit that blows fuses and am troubleshooting the switch
and motor.  the shafts are free and not causing a lockup.  Does anyone have
an switch diagram or schematic of the internals of the wiper switch for a 70
Type 2?  The Bentley schematic just show a switch and not detail.  Also, I
measure about .6 ohms across the 2 wires that go into the motor.  I would
expect to measure a small winding resistance, but this seems strangely low.
What do you think?

Thanks!

Scott
