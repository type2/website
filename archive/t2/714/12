Subject: Re: [T2] Shocks for 72 bus

I did my rears like a month before the first one. I'm still getting in
on this order. My KYB Gas A Just shocks in the rear were a massive
improvement over the 30 year old stock shocks that were on there.

However, these busses didn't come with high pressure gas shocks. 

I can't wait until I get my hands on these Konis. =)
