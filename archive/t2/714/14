There is an electric widget you can use on one of these setups, it is from a
pinto or something. Someone else help me here. Some older American car that
used a progressive carb from the factory with the same bolt pattern. It is a
12v heater. But it isn't a Canadian thing specifically. I have also seen
people use some 12v flexible heating wire and just wrap it around the
runners.

The best advice you can give someone with a progressive carb in to take it
off and put proper carbs on there or go back to stock FI. I know this is not
always workable if you have the thing running OK and not much bread to
spare.
