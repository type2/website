 Anyone know definitively? If only minor mods are needed, we'll be 
 ordering some of these from Ron as well.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The lower mount hole size changed from 68/69 to 70 and up.

68/69 lower mount is 10mm. The nut part number N 11 010 4 to chassis number 219 300000

70 and up is 12mm. The nut part N 11 020 2 from 210 2000001 is 12 x 1.5

The top of the shock appears to be narrower on the 68/69 then the 70 and up.

68/69 upper bolt is part number 211 413 401A and is 12 x 1.5 x 95mm

70 up upper bolt was part number N 10 192 1 and was 12 x 1.5 x 100mm
This has been replaced by N 10 706 01 and is 12 x 1.5 102mm.....

Not a minor mod! If you put these Konis on a 68/69, the shocks will knock at the lower mounts.
You would need longer upper bolts and a sleeve to fit inside the lower hole to reduce the hole size 2mm.
