Subject: Re: [T2] Black Snap Strap

Not that I know of.....
I try to grab all I see at the yards.
I have brown ones, white ones, black ones.
Just don't ask where I have them, everytime I come
back with a bunch of smalls, I put them in a box and
that is the last I see of them until I look for
something else. Kinda like Christmas, open a box and
be surprized.

 There are a number of places on my '79 Westy that
 use a small black strap
 with a snap to hold things down - for example: when
 storing the table on the cushion over the motor.
 
 Is there a source for these or a source for the
 black plastic strap material (as snaps are easy to   
find)?
