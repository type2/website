This engine has a VW of Canada Reman tag on it, so I would expect it to be put together properly, but then again I really have no idea whether it has been apart since it left VW.  Remember that this engine ran fine when I originally purchased it with the sunroof bus, so the cam timing is not likely to be the problem.

Not sure if it would account for 60 degrees or not,  but if the locating pin on the fan hub is sheared off or missing, the fan could go onto the hub three different ways, only one of which would be right.

.. now that I think about it, that may not be the problem after all.  360deg  / 3 == 120deg.  Hm.  Curiouser and curiouser..
