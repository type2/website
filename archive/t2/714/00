Subject: Re: [T2] what happens if you don't change your oil in 10,000

True,
Lexus/Toyota has had an "engine gel" campaign on their 3.0L V6 motors 
for several years now.  Toyota knows its a design flaw and are backing 
up their product.  SPA states if you can prove you had the oil changed 
at least once in the last  year, regardless of miles, they will replace 
motor.   Yes, replace.  I've seen these motors so sludge up from lack 
of oil changes and using inferior quality oil, that when you removed 
valve cover, you saw the exact imprint of bottom of valve cover on top 
of head molded with sludge!!!  YUCK.
