The rears will fit. The only thing Koni changed on the rears is that the
later version of the shock (which are the ones I got) were slightly modified
to better handle the added weight of the type 4 engine, but they maintained
suitability for type 1 engined busses as well (since both engine options
were offered in Europe thru '82). But as for the fronts, I couldn't get any
info from Koni as to why they list them as '70-up. Most other shock
manufacturers, except for Boge, use the same part number for '68-79 up
front. So obviously they are very similar, but I'm not sure exactly what the
difference is.  I've never had a '68 or '69 bus myself.  Maybe someone on
the list knows of a difference between '68-69 and '70-up shock mounts that
I'm not aware of?  Perhaps the bushing?
