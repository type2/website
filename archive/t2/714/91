Depends.  You should get a signed release from corporations for photos,
film or video of trademarks, etc.  Often brands are obscured on tv for
this reason.

Lots of grey areas here.

If the images were licensed and you were gaining income from use of the 
bus and the images were published for profit I think you might have a 
case but you should check with an attorney.

Copyright law places the burden of enforcing the rights of the copyright 
holder on them.  They are required to defend their copyright or risk 
losing it.

It is their option to provide someone with permission but they must 
pursue those they know or should know to be using their work without 
permission.
