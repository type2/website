There has been a lot of discussion on this in the past... There are
"close" veneers out there, but not the original stuff. Even if you
found the original veneer, the color would be different due to age and
fading.

Your best bet is going to be trying to reglue the original veneer.
Contact cement and a hard rubber roller. Unless you can find a cabinet
maker willing to do it with a vacuum bag for you (best choice!)
