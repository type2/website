Subject: Re: [T2] what happens if you don't change your oil in 10,000 

I heard this one last friday morning from the subaru service manager.

He used to work for Toyota/Honda and talked about it while my oil was 
being changed.  He didn't quite explain why the problem occured, but said 
that one of his buds with 20+ years experience had figured out why and new 
how to fix the engines so they wouldn't do it again....sure would like to 
know what would make modern engine oil "gel" up like that.

Bus Content:  My 78 never does that kind of stuff...

Cheers, dave
