Hi Scott -

Don't forget to at least consider a new engine.  At around $1300-1400 it's
about the same price as a rebuilt engine (when you consider the core charge),
but built out of new parts instead of used ones.

If your '70 still has the single-port manifold, you would need to upgrade it
to dual-port... I don't think there are any other complications.  The
Meximotor was was quite straightforward to install on my '71, although I was
very glad to have some help from another listmember*.

Cheers,

- Miles
