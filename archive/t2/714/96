Well depending on the state DMV and how slick someone is they can easily
pull your registration, find out who you are, where your live, and
presumable that's were to steal your bus from, or if its someone you pissed
off over the net who knows what they do to you, etc...

Simply security issue, why would you plaster your license plate all over the
net for people you don't know to track you down with. It's bad enough the
guy you just cut off can get your tag #... why give it to everyone in the
world?
