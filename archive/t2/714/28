I just love it when I research a question and give everyone the answer and a ?? VW mechanic replies with
something so wrong......

Mark, READ what I wrote: I said you will need longer UPPER bolts and a sleeve to reduce the lower hole.

You can get all the 12mm bolts you want and redo the threads to 10mm til the cows come home. THAT will never
correct the bottom mount. Last time I looked, the lower mount is a FIXED STUD coming out of steering knuckle.
THAT is why I listed the part number of the NUT.

I don't need this crap.
