Subject: general Westy stuff

I recently purchased a '74 Campmobile. Not sure if
it's got a 1700, 1800 or 2000 engine (engine present
is original). What is a good brand and part number for
the oil filter?

also, any info/suggestions on synthetic oils? Some one
suggested I use a synth in the bus.

Do you reularly shift from 3rd to 4th at around 40mph?
My tranny seems to whine just a tad until it gets up
to 45+ in 4th gear.

One more thing- my windshield washer switch leaks at
the steering column under pressure. any
comments/hints? 

Thanks, I love the list!
