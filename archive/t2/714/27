Subject: Re: [T2] Shocks for 72 bus

I put Gabriel Striders on the rear of my 70 bus in the 70's. They had a 
lifetime guarantee but the parts store is long gone and the shocks still 
seem to be working OK (150,00 miles total). In other words I suspect shocks 
that are three weeks old may last a bit longer.
