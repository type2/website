Subject: Re: [T2] Paint and/or process advice for westy pop-top?

I used a urethane heavy build primer with acrylic enamel white all shot from a gun. Looks good 5 years later BUT the cracks in the luggage area came back through... Mine had a few tiny stress cracks. Now the areas I repaired are still pretty. Be advised that was 5 years year round TN outside.
