And a public thinks to Joe for taking several special photo's of the 
Puma(page 2)so that I could see what it looked like inside better than 
some of the other photo's I have.

I have a 77 version of one of these and have never seen another one "in 
person".

Again, thanks a lot Joe!!!

Cheers, dave
