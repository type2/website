Thanks. Do you have an idea where to source 12v flexible heating wire?

On an unrelated note, were you the one sourcing the commonly missing
left side manifold support bracket? I've got my engine out and would
like to put it together right.

Thanks again,

John

 There is an electric widget you can use on one of these setups, it is from a
 pinto or something. Someone else help me here. Some older American car that
 used a progressive carb from the factory with the same bolt pattern. It is a
 12v heater. But it isn't a Canadian thing specifically. I have also seen
 people use some 12v flexible heating wire and just wrap it around the
 runners.
