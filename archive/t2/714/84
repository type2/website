Yes, it is a Westy original part. It came in the
Deluxe Westies from 76 to 79. The Deluxe Westy was the
P-27 model. It came with stove, fridge, and front
table.

No, it was not a toilet. It was a trash can. In it
came a plastic covered bucket.

They came in 2 heights = low for the early ones
without the swivel passenger seat. Tall for the later
Wesies with the swivel seat.

I have pics of both with the yellow bucket here:

The stools are out there, but the bucket is scarce.

Awhile back I posted the exact size and dimensions to
the list.

There was someone repo'ing them and selling them on
ebarf but I have not seen them in about a year.

Looking at both Mike's and Kevin's photos I see this
 little cube stool 
 thing with a cushion on it matching the Westy
 upholstery.  Is this 
 designed to hold "Mr. Crapper's invention'? An Ice
 Box?
 
 My Westy did not have one but as a stool and  fourth
 seat, (with or 
 without what came inside) it would SURE come in
 handy.
 
 Where can I find one of these?  Is it Westy
 original?
