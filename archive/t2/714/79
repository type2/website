Don't forget that when the motor reaches the park
position it cuts the park power and shorts out the
armature to ground to brake the motor to a stop.

I don't understand the stop/start behavior.  Something
is screwy.  You
should
be powering at two points, one a constant voltage for
the return; the 
second

would correspond to power from the 'ON' switch, in
your case a direct 
line
to
the power supply.  The body of the motor should be
connected to the 
negative
on
the power supply.  With those connections the motor
should run 
continuously.
