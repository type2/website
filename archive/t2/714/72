Subject: Black Snap Strap

There are a number of places on my '79 Westy that use a small black strap
with a snap to hold things down - for example: when storing the table on the
cushion over the motor.

 

Is there a source for these or a source for the black plastic strap material
(as snaps are easy to find)?

 

TIA
