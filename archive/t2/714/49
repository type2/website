Subject: Re: [T2] Are KONI shocks really that great?

Commenting on the statement of dialing in the firmness, BD mentions 
doing it upon installation or reinstallation- can this be done once the 
shock is installed, with minimal effort, like by my 19 yr old daughter 
on her 75?  I'd like to get in on the buy if so.


The beauty of the Koni's is that they actually allow you to "dial in" the
  ride firmness upon installation (or reinstallation). With any other shock,
  you have to live with the setting that the manufacturer chose; once 
you buy
  it you'rs stuck with it. With the Koni's you choose it yourself. What's
  more, even as the shocks age, you can simply readjust them to restore them
  to the setting that you originally chose. So you can start off with 
the ride
  that you like, and can maintain that ride forever.
