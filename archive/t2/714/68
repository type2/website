I thought that the stopping was odd, too, but I have no experience with
VW's.  Thanks for the information.  The stopping explains why the current
draw goes throught the roof when it stops.   It seems that the current draw
while running is about normal, however. I'm planning to tear the motor down
again and really look into the internals.

I found a internal switch schematic in the Bentley CD repair manual.  It
seems all is working properly with the switch.

Thanks very much for the input.

Scott

I don't understand the stop/start behavior.  Something is screwy.  You
should
be powering at two points, one a constant voltage for the return; the second

would correspond to power from the 'ON' switch, in your case a direct line
to
the power supply.  The body of the motor should be connected to the negative
on
the power supply.  With those connections the motor should run continuously.

Have you checked (with fingers) to see that the armature turns freely?
