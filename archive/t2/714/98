That's right, Greg, it looks great in the pictures on your website!
Nothing more need be said, especially since I remembered the cardinal
rule of mailing lists - RTFA (Read the ... Archives)!  Over the weekend
I did just that and found a couple of helpful posts on painting the top
with marine paint:

From Scott Wetzel, 9/6/04:

I'm sure there are others in there, but these were enough to get a good
idea of how to go about restoring the pop-top.

In the future, I'll be sure to search the archives before asking
questions.  Lots of good info in there!

Jeremy

Hi Jeremy,

Then I guess I don't have to say much, other than to mention how good
it looks 4 years later.

Happy trails,
