Subject: Distributor curves graphed

An opportunity came up that gave me access to one of those old Sun
distribututor machines so I pulled as many working distributors as I could
find and spun them up and graphed the results.

I've wanted to do this for a long time but was too lazy to swap them one by
one into my bus and shine the timing light on them. The distributor machine
makes the process completely painless.

205P is 021-905-025P from my 78 bus (stock).
CIP1 is the Mexican Bosch 0 231 170 034 from California Imports
SVDA is the Mexican Bosch 0 231 170 034 from ACN
205AB is 021-905-205AB from a 76 bus (stock)
205E is 021-905-205E from a 72 bus (stock)

From the graph you can see that the 205P curve is ideal, the CIP1 dizzy is a
close second, and the SVDA from ACN has the slowest advance. The vacuum cans
are basically identical.
