Subject: Re: [T2] what happens if you don't change your oil in 10,000

<10 years ago I was living with a guy who had gone at least 20k miles on his
 Ford Bronco without changing the oil>

1984 Ford Escort. 52K miles with factory oil and filter... Seriously! Guys asked me (I was 16 or 17 years old then) how often he ought to change it. I said 3K give or take a little. I was mostly dumbfounded by the this basic part of car ownership being missed on this guy. 

He changed it. Engine was dead by 60K miles. I think the reason he asked in the first place was it was starting to develop problems (noises, smoke, low power). I think the oil change prob also caused alot of sludge to break loose and circulate too. 

FWIW YMMV
