Subject: Timing is everything

Greg... about your valves,, are they hydraulic lifters? I am sure you realize
that they should be 1- 2 turns tight...
solid lifters are 0.006" loose... that is 6 <six> thousands of an inch...

As for your timing mark.
The Type 4 Fan cannot bolt on any other way than correct... the bolt holes are
NOT equal spaced and will not attach to the crank if it is rotated anywhere
but correct.
just so you know,, in case it helps... the 2 bolts that are the closest
together have the dowel pin between them

The pulley bolts to the fan with 4 equal spaced bolts
It can be put on wrong...
The timing notch is on the pulley
if the pulley was bolted to the fan wrong,,, that would make the timing mark
out by 90 deg.

The tiny little notch on the Type 4 alt belt pulley can be very hard to find,,
maybe you are looking at a nick.. and not the notch?  lol
The notch should be about 40mm from a 'pulley to fan' mounting bolt... your
looking at the square nut end of the bolt if you look at the pulley.

Look at the pully ,,find your timing mark , find the nearest square nut on the
rim,, it should be 40mm away.
If  *your* timing mark isn't 40mm away,, maybe that is a nick
look for a notch that is 40mm away from a nut,, turn the engine over till it
lines up with TDC, then check your valve setting and piston alignment to
ensure they confirm all is at TDC,,, then time the ignition using that notch.

Other than that,, maybe your crank is broken,, and the timing mark is not
indexed anymore?  lol,, doubt that, but I have seen it
Maybe your woodruff key is not holding your fan ,, and has let go like a shear
pin....

It doesn't take long to unbolt the fan
