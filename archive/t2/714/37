Subject: Is this distributor compatible?

Hi everyone,



I was cruising theSamba looking for a replacement to the 009 and came
apart this part # 113-905-205-T




I cross referenced it against the Old Volks list and found a part #
113-905-205AH


What does the T and the AH stand for? In addition, are these compatible?



Thanks for the help,



Max
