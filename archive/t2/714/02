Subject: Paint and/or process advice for westy pop-top?

Hi all!  First post for me, but I've been reading along for a while and
have
gotten a lot of great info, so thanks for that.  I just bought (about a
month
ago) a '76 type 2 pop-top Westy, and I'm in the process of cleaning her
up and
getting engine work done (website soon to come, I promise!).

My fiberglass pop-top and luggage rack are not looking too good - not
terrible,
but stained and worn to the point that I am not going to be able to get
them as
gleaming-white as I want to by cleaning them.  Besides that, the fibers
are
exposed and starting to fuzz up.  I have read/heard of people using
marine paint
(I know Bob the Tomato got a couple coats of yacht paint, for example)
to
restore pop-tops.  Does anybody have any advice on what kind of paint to
use,
how to prep, how to apply the paint, etc?

Thanks again for all the great info, and I hope I will be able to
contribute in
the future!
